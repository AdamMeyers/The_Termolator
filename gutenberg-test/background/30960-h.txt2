The PEOPLE of the CRATER

A COMPLETE NOVELETTE

BY ANDREW NORTH

"Send the Black Throne to dust; conquer the Black Ones, and bring the Daughter from the Caves of Darkness." These were
the tasks Garin must perform to fulfill the prophecy of the Ancient Ones&mdash;and establish his own destiny in this hidden land!

CHAPTER ONE

Through the Blue Haze

Six months and three days after the Peace of
Shanghai was signed and the great War of 1965-1970 declared
at an end by an exhausted world, a young man huddled
on a park bench in New York, staring miserably at
the gravel beneath his badly worn shoes. He had been
trained to fill the pilot's seat in the control cabin of a fighting
plane and for nothing else. The search for a niche in
civilian life had cost him both health and ambition.

A newcomer dropped down on the other end of the
bench. The flyer studied him bitterly. He had decent
shoes, a warm coat, and that air of satisfaction with the
world which is the result of economic security. Although
he was well into middle age, the man had a compact grace
of movement and an air of alertness.

"Aren't you Captain Garin Featherstone?"

Startled, the flyer nodded dumbly.

From a plump billfold the man drew a clipping and
waved it toward his seat mate. Two years before, Captain
Garin Featherstone of the United Democratic Forces had
led a perilous bombing raid into the wilds of Siberia to wipe
out the vast expeditionary army secretly gathering there.
It had been a spectacular affair and had brought the survivors
some fleeting fame.

"You're the sort of chap I've been looking for," the
stranger folded the clipping again, "a flyer with courage,
initiative and brains. The man who led that raid is worth
investing in."

"What's the proposition?" asked Featherstone wearily.
He no longer believed in luck.

"I'm Gregory Farson," the other returned as if that
should answer the question.

"The Antarctic man!"

"Just so. As you have probably heard, I was halted on
the eve of my last expedition by the sudden spread of war
to this country. Now I am preparing to sail south again."

"But I don't see&mdash;"

"How you can help me? Very simple, Captain Featherstone.
I need pilots. Unfortunately the war has disposed
of most of them. I'm lucky to contact one such as
yourself&mdash;"



And it was as simple as that. But Garin didn't really
believe that it was more than a dream until they touched
the glacial shores of the polar continent some months later.
As they brought ashore the three large planes, he began to
wonder at the driving motive behind Farson's vague plans.

When the supply ship sailed, not to return for a year,
Farson called them together. Three of the company were
pilots, all war veterans, and two were engineers who spent
most of their waking hours engrossed in the maps Farson
produced.



"Tomorrow," the leader glanced from face to face, "we
start inland. Here&mdash;" On a map spread before him he
indicated a line marked in purple.

"Ten years ago I was a member of the Verdane expedition.
Once, when flying due south, our plane was caught
by some freakish air current and drawn off its course.
When we were totally off our map, we saw in the distance
a thick bluish haze. It seemed to rise in a straight line
from the ice plain to the sky. Unfortunately our fuel was
low and we dared not risk a closer investigation. So we
fought our way back to the base.

"Verdane, however, had little interest in our report and
we did not investigate it. Three years ago that Kattack
expedition, hunting oil deposits by the order of the Dictator,
reported seeing the same haze. This time we are
going to explore it!"

"Why," Garin asked curiously, "are you so eager to
penetrate this haze?&mdash;I gather that's what we're to do&mdash;"

Farson hesitated before answering. "It has often been
suggested that beneath the ice sheeting of this continent
may be hidden mineral wealth. I believe that the haze is
caused by some form of volcanic activity, and perhaps a
break in the crust."

Garin frowned at the map. He wasn't so sure about
that explanation, but Farson was paying the bills. The
flyer shrugged away his uneasiness. Much could be forgiven
a man who allowed one to eat regularly again.

Four days later they set out. Helmly, one of the engineers,
Rawlson, a pilot, and Farson occupied the first
plane. The other engineer and pilot were in the second and
Garin, with the extra supplies, was alone in the third.

He was content to be alone as they took off across the
blue-white waste. His ship, because of its load, was loggy,
so he did not attempt to follow the other two into the
higher lane. They were in communication by radio and
Garin, as he snapped on his earphones, remembered something
Farson had said that morning:

"The haze affects radio. On our trip near it the static
was very bad. Almost," with a laugh, "like speech in
some foreign tongue."

As they roared over the ice Garin wondered if it might
have been speech&mdash;from, perhaps, a secret enemy expedition,
such as the Kattack one.

In his sealed cockpit he did not feel the bite of the frost
and the ship rode smoothly. With a little sigh of content
he settled back against the cushions, keeping to the course
set by the planes ahead and above him.

Some five hours after they left the base, Garin caught
sight of a dark shadow far ahead. At the same time Farson's
voice chattered in his earphones.

"That's it. Set course straight ahead."

The shadow grew until it became a wall of purple-blue
from earth to sky. The first plane was quite close to it,
diving down into the vapor. Suddenly the ship rocked violently
and swung earthward as if out of control. Then it
straightened and turned back. Garin could hear Farson
demanding to know what was the matter. But from the
first plane there was no reply.

As Farson's plane kept going Garin throttled down. The
actions of the first ship indicated trouble. What if that
haze were a toxic gas?

"Close up, Featherstone!" barked Farson suddenly.

He obediently drew ahead until they flew wing to wing.
The haze was just before them and now Garin could see
movement in it, oily, impenetrable billows. The motors bit
into it. There was clammy, foggy moisture on the windows.

Abruptly Garin sensed that he was no longer alone.
Somewhere in the empty cabin behind him was another intelligence,
a measuring power. He fought furiously against
it&mdash;against the very idea of it. But, after a long, terrifying
moment while it seemed to study him, it took control.
His hands and feet still manipulated the ship, but it flew!

On the ship hurtled through the thickening mist. He
lost sight of Farson's plane. And, though he was still
fighting against the will which over-rode his, his struggles
grew weaker. Then came the order to dive into the dark
heart of the purple mists.



Down they whirled. Once, as the haze opened, Garin
caught a glimpse of tortured gray rock seamed with yellow.
Farson had been right: here the ice crust was broken.

Down and down. If his instruments were correct the
plane was below sea level now. The haze thinned and was
gone. Below spread a plain cloaked in vivid green. Here
and there reared clumps of what might be trees. He saw,
too, the waters of a yellow stream.

But there was something terrifyingly alien about that
landscape. Even as he circled above it, Garin wrested to
break the grip of the will that had brought him there.
There came a crackle of sound in his earphones and at that
moment the Presence withdrew.

The nose of the plane went up in obedience to his own
desire. Frantically he climbed away from the green land.
Again the haze absorbed him. He watched the moisture
bead on the windows. Another hundred feet or so and he
would be free of it&mdash;and that unbelievable world beneath.

Then, with an ominous sputter, the port engine conked
out. The plane lurched and slipped into a dive. Down it
whirled again into the steady light of the green land.

Trees came out of the ground, huge fern-like plants with
crimson scaled trunks. Toward a clump of these the
plane swooped.

Frantically Garin fought the controls. The ship steadied,
the dive became a fast glide. He looked for an open space
to land. Then he felt the landing gear scrape some surface.
Directly ahead loomed one of the fern trees. The plane
sped toward the long fronds. There came a ripping crash,
the splintering of metal and wood. The scarlet cloud gathering
before Garin's eyes turned black.


CHAPTER TWO

The Folk of Tav

Garin returned to consciousness through a red mist of
pain. He was pinned in the crumpled mass of metal which
had once been the cabin. Through a rent in the wall close
to his head thrust a long spike of green, shredded leaves
still clinging to it. He lay and watched it, not daring to
move lest the pain prove more than he could bear.

It was then that he heard the pattering sound outside.
It seemed as if soft hands were pushing and pulling at the
wreck. The tree branch shook and a portion of the cabin
wall dropped away with a clang.

Garin turned his head slowly. Through the aperture
was clambering a goblin figure.

It stood about five feet tall, and it walked upon its hind
legs in human fashion, but the legs were short and stumpy,
ending in feet with five toes of equal length. Slender,
shapely arms possessed small hands with only four digits.
The creature had a high, well-rounded forehead but no
chin, the face being distinctly lizard-like in contour. The
skin was a dull black, with a velvety surface. About its
loins it wore a short kilt of metallic cloth, the garment being
supported by a jeweled belt of exquisite workmanship.

For a long moment the apparition eyed Garin. And it
was those golden eyes, fixed unwinkingly on his, which banished
the flyer's fear. There was nothing but great pity
in their depths.

The lizard-man stooped and brushed the sweat-dampened
hair from Garin's forehead. Then he fingered the bonds
of metal which held the flyer, as if estimating their
strength. Having done so, he turned to the opening and
apparently gave an order, returning again to squat by
Garin.

Two more of his kind appeared to tear away the ruins
of the cockpit. Though they were very careful, Garin
fainted twice before they had freed him. He was placed
on a litter swung between two clumsy beasts which might
have been small elephants, except that they lacked trunks
and possessed four tusks each.

They crossed the plain to the towering mouth of a huge
cavern where the litter was taken up by four of the lizard-folk.
The flyer lay staring up at the roof of the cavern.
In the black stone had been carved fronds and flowers in
bewildering profusion. Shining motes, giving off faint
light, sifted through the air. At times as they advanced,
these gathered in clusters and the light grew brighter.

Midway down a long corridor the bearers halted while
their leader pulled upon a knob on the wall. An oval door
swung back and the party passed through.

They came into a round room, the walls of which had
been fashioned of creamy quartz veined with violet. At
the highest point in the ceiling a large globe of the motes
hung, furnishing soft light below.

Two lizard-men, clad in long robes, conferred with the
leader of the flyer's party before coming to stand over
Garin. One of the robed ones shook his head at the sight
of the flyer's twisted body and waved the litter on into an
inner chamber.

Here the walls were dull blue and in the exact center was
a long block of quartz. By this the litter was put down
and the bearers disappeared. With sharp knives the robed
men cut away furs and leather to expose Garin's broken
body.

They lifted him to the quartz table and there made him
fast with metal bonds. Then one of them went to the wall
and pulled a gleaming rod. From the dome of the roof
shot an eerie blue light to beat upon Garin's helpless body.
There followed a tingling through every muscle and joint,
a prickling sensation in his skin, but soon his pain vanished
as if it had never been.

The light flashed off and the three lizard-men gathered
around him. He was wrapped in a soft robe and carried
to another room. This, too, was circular, shaped like the
half of a giant bubble. The floor sloped toward the center
where there was a depression filled with cushions. There
they laid Garin. At the top of the bubble, a pinkish cloud
formed. He watched it drowsily until he fell asleep.

Something warm stirred against his bare shoulder. He
opened his eyes, for a moment unable to remember where
he was. Then there was a plucking at the robe twisted
about him and he looked down.



If the lizard-folk had been goblin in their grotesqueness
this visitor was elfin. It was about three feet high, its monkey-like
body completely covered with silky white hair.
The tiny hands were human in shape and hairless, but its
feet were much like a cat's paws. From either side of the
small round head branched large fan-shaped ears. The
face was furred and boasted stiff cat whiskers on the upper
lip. These Anas, as Garin learned later, were happy little
creatures, each one choosing some mistress or master among
the Folk, as this one had come to him. They were
content to follow their big protector, speechless with delight
at trifling gifts. Loyal and brave, they could do
simple tasks or carry written messages for their chosen
friend, and they remained with him until death. They were
neither beast nor human, but rumored to be the result of
some experiment carried out eons ago by the Ancient Ones.

After patting Garin's shoulder the Ana touched the
flyer's hair wonderingly, comparing the bronze lengths
with its own white fur. Since the Folk were hairless, hair
was a strange sight in the Caverns. With a contented
purr, it rubbed its head against his hand.

With a sudden click a door in the wall opened. The Ana
got to its feet and ran to greet the newcomers. The chieftain
of the Folk, he who had first discovered Garin, entered,
followed by several of his fellows.

The flyer sat up. Not only was the pain gone but he
felt stronger and younger than he had for weary months.
Exultingly, he stretched wide his arms and grinned at the
lizard-being who murmured happily in return.

Lizard-men busied themselves about Garin, girding on
him the short kilt and jewel-set belt which were the only
clothing of the Caverns. When they were finished, the
chieftain took his hand and drew him to the door.

They traversed a hallway whose walls were carved and
inlaid with glittering stones and metalwork, coming, at
last, into a huge cavern, the outer walls of which were hidden
by shadows. On a dais stood three tall thrones and
Garin was conducted to the foot of these.

The highest throne was of rose crystal. On its right
was one of green jade, worn smooth by centuries of time.
At the left was the third, carved of a single block of jet.
The rose throne and that of jet were unoccupied, but in
the seat of jade reposed one of the Folk. He was taller
than his fellows, and in his eyes, as he stared at Garin, was
wisdom&mdash;and a brooding sadness.

"It is well!" The words resounded in the flyer's head.
"We have chosen wisely. This youth is fit to mate with the
Daughter. But he will be tried, as fire tries metal. He
must win the Daughter forth and strive with Kepta&mdash;"

A hissing murmur echoed through the hall. Garin guessed
that hundreds of the Folk must be gathered there.

"Urg!" the being on the throne commanded.

The chieftain moved a step toward the dais.

"Do you take this youth and instruct him. And then
will I speak with him again. For&mdash;" sadness colored the
words now&mdash;"we would have the rose throne filled again
and the black one blasted into dust. Time moves swiftly."

The Chieftain led a wondering Garin away.


CHAPTER THREE

Garin Hears of the Black Ones

Urg brought the flyer into one of the bubble-shaped
rooms which contained a low, cushioned bench facing a metal
screen&mdash;and here they seated themselves.

What followed was a language lesson. On the screen
appeared objects which Urg would name, to have his sibilant
uttering repeated by Garin. As the American later
learned, the ray treatment he had undergone had quickened
his mental powers, and in an incredibly short time he
had a working vocabulary.

Judging by the pictures the lizard folk were the rulers
of the crater world, although there were other forms of life
there. The elephant-like Tand was a beast of burden, the
squirrel-like Eron lived underground and carried on a crude
agriculture in small clearings, coming shyly twice a year
to exchange grain for a liquid rubber produced by the Folk.

Then there was the Gibi, a monstrous bee, also friendly
to the lizard people. It supplied the cavern dwellers with
wax, and in return the Folk gave the Gibi colonies shelter
during the unhealthful times of the Great Mists.

Highly civilized were the Folk. They did no work by
hand, except the finer kinds of jewel setting and carving.
Machines wove their metal cloth, machines prepared their
food, harvested their fields, hollowed out new dwellings.

Freed from manual labor they had turned to acquiring
knowledge. Urg projected on the screen pictures of vast
laboratories and great libraries of scientific lore. But
all they knew in the beginning, they had learned from the
Ancient Ones, a race unlike themselves, which had preceded
them in sovereignty over Tav. Even the Folk themselves
were the result of constant forced evolution and experimentation
carried on by these Ancient Ones.

All this wisdom was guarded most carefully, but against
what or whom, Urg could not tell, although he insisted
that the danger was very real. There was something within
the blue wall of the crater which disputed the Folk's rule.

As Garin tried to probe further a gong sounded. Urg
arose.

"It is the hour of eating," he announced. "Let us go."

They came to a large room where a heavy table of white
stone stretched along three walls, benches before it. Urg
seated himself and pressed a knob on the table, motioning
Garin to do likewise. The wall facing them opened and
two trays slid out. There was a platter of hot meat covered
with rich sauce, a stone bowl of grain porridge and a
cluster of fruit, still fastened to a leafy branch. This the
Ana eyed so wistfully that Garin gave it to the creature.

The Folk ate silently and arose quietly when they had
finished, their trays vanishing back through the wall. Garin
noticed only males in the room and recalled that he had,
as yet, seen no females among the Folk. He ventured a
question.

Urg chuckled. "So, you think there are no women in
the Caverns? Well, we shall go to the Hall of Women
that you may see."

To the Hall of Women they went. It was breath-taking
in its richness, stones worth a nation's ransom sparkling
from its domed roof and painted walls. Here were the
matrons and maidens of the Folk, their black forms veiled
in robes of silver net, each cross strand of which was set
with a tiny gem, so that they appeared to be wrapped in
glittering scales.

There were not many of them&mdash;a hundred perhaps. And
a few led by the hand smaller editions of themselves, who
stared at Garin with round yellow eyes and chewed black
fingertips shyly.

The women were intrusted with the finest jewel work,
and with pride they showed the stranger their handiwork.
At the far end of the hall was a wonderous thing in the
making. One of the silver nets, which were the foundations
of their robes, was fastened there and three of the
women were putting small rose jewels into each microscopic
setting. Here and there they had varied the pattern
with tiny emeralds or flaming opals, so that the finished
portion was a rainbow.

One of the workers smoothed the robe and glanced up
at Garin, a gentle teasing in her voice as she explained:

"This is for the Daughter when she comes to her throne."

The Daughter! What had the Lord of the Folk said?
"This youth is fit to mate with the Daughter." But Urg
had said that the Ancient Ones had gone from Tav.

"Who is the Daughter?" he demanded.

"Thrala of the Light."

"Where is she?"

The woman shivered and there was fear in her eyes.
"Thrala lies in the Caves of Darkness."

"The Caves of Darkness!" Did she mean Thrala was
dead? Was he, Garin Featherstone, to be the victim of
some rite of sacrifice which was designed to unite him
with the dead?

Urg touched his arm. "Not so. Thrala has not yet entered
the Place of Ancestors."

"You know my thoughts?"

Urg laughed. "Thoughts are easy to read. Thrala lives.
Sera served the Daughter as handmaiden while she was
yet among us. Sera, do you show us Thrala as she was."

The woman crossed to a wall where there was a mirror
such as Urg had used for his language lesson. She gazed
into it and then beckoned the flyer to stand beside her.

The mirror misted and then he was looking, as if through
a window, into a room with walls and ceiling of rose quartz.
On the floor were thick rugs of silver rose. And a great
heap of cushions made a low couch in the center.

"The inner chamber of the Daughter," Sera announced.



A circular panel in the wall opened and a woman slipped
through. She was very young, little more than a girl.
There were happy curves in her full crimson lips, joyous
lights in her violet eyes.

She was human of shape, but her beauty was unearthly.
Her skin was pearl white and other colors seemed to play
faintly upon it, so that it reminded Garin of mother-of-pearl
with its lights and shadows. The hair, which veiled her
as a cloud, was blue-black and reached below her knees.
She was robed in the silver net of the Folk and there was a
heavy girdle of rose-shaded jewels about her slender waist.

"That was Thrala before the Black Ones took her," said
Sera.

Garin uttered a cry of disappointment as the picture
vanished. Urg laughed.

"What care you for shadows when the Daughter herself
waits for you? You have but to bring her from the Caves
of Darkness&mdash;"

"Where are these Caves&mdash;" Garin's question was interrupted
by the pealing of the Cavern gong. Sera cried out:

"The Black Ones!"

Urg shrugged. "When they spared not the Ancient Ones
how could we hope to escape? Come, we must go to the
Hall of Thrones."

Before the jade throne of the Lord of the Folk stood a
small group of the lizard-men beside two litters. As Garin
entered the Lord spoke.

"Let the outlander come hither that he may see the work
of the Black Ones."

Garin advanced unwillingly, coming to stand by those
struggling things which gasped their message between
moans and screams of agony. They were men of the Folk
but their black skins were green with rot.

The Lord leaned forward on his throne. "It is well," he
said. "You may depart."

As if obeying his command, the tortured things let go of
the life to which they had clung and were still.

"Look upon the work of the Black Ones," the ruler said
to Garin. "Jiv and Betv were captured while on a mission
to the Gibi of the Cliff. It seems that the Black Ones needed
material for their laboratories. They seek even to give
the Daughter to their workers of horror!"

A terrible cry of hatred arose from the hall, and Garin's
jaw set. To give that fair vision he had just seen to such
a death as this&mdash;!

"Jiv and Betv were imprisoned close to the Daughter
and they heard the threats of Kepta. Our brothers, stricken
with foul disease, were sent forth to carry the plague to
us, but they swam through the pool of boiling mud. They
have died, but the evil died with them. And I think that
while we breed such as they, the Black Ones shall not rest
easy. Listen now, outlander, to the story of the Black
Ones and the Caves of Darkness, of how the Ancient Ones
brought the Folk up from the slime of a long dried sea and
made them great, and of how the Ancient Ones at last went
down to their destruction."


CHAPTER FOUR

The Defeat of the Ancient Ones

"In the days before the lands of the outer world were
born of the sea, before even the Land of the Sun (Mu)
and the Land of the Sea (Atlantis) arose from molten rock
and sand, there was land here in the far south. A sere
land of rock plains, and swamps where slimy life mated,
lived and died.

"Then came the Ancient Ones from beyond the stars.
Their race was already older than this earth. Their wise
men had watched its birth-rending from the sun. And
when their world perished, taking most of their blood into
nothingness, a handful fled hither.

"But when they climbed from their space ship it was into
hell. For they had gained, in place of their loved home,
bare rock and stinking slime.

"They blasted out this Tav and entered into it with the
treasures of their flying ships and also certain living creatures
captured in the swamps. From these, they produced
the Folk, the Gibi, the Tand, and the land-tending Eron.

"Among these, the Folk were eager for wisdom and
climbed high. But still the learning of the Ancient Ones
remained beyond their grasp.

"During the eons the Ancient Ones dwelt within their
protecting wall of haze the outer world changed. Cold
came to the north and south; the Land of Sun and the
Land of Sea arose to bear the foot of true man. On their
mirrors of seeing the Ancient Ones watched man-life spread
across the world. They had the power of prolonging life,
but still the race was dying. From without must come
new blood. So certain men were summoned from the
Land of the Sun. Then the race flourished for a space.

"The Ancient Ones decided to leave Tav for the outer
world. But the sea swallowed the Land of Sun. Again,
in the time of the Land of Sea, the stock within Tav was
replenished and the Ancient Ones prepared for exodus;
again the sea cheated them.

"Those men left in the outer world reverted to savagery.
Since the Ancient Ones would not mingle their blood with
that of almost beasts, they built the haze wall stronger and
remained. But a handful of them were attracted by the
forbidden, and secretly they summoned the beast men.
Of that monstrous mating came the Black Ones. They
live but for the evil they may do, and the power which they
acquired is debased and used to forward cruelty.

"At first their sin was not discovered. When it was, the
others would have slain the offspring but for the law which
forbids them to kill. They must use their power for good
or it departs from them. So they drove the Black Ones
to the southern end of Tav and gave them the Caves of
Darkness. Never were the Black Ones to come north of
the River of Gold&mdash;nor were the Ancient Ones to go south
of it.

"For perhaps two thousand years the Black Ones kept
the law. But they worked, building powers of destruction.
While matters rested thus, the Ancient Ones searched the
world, seeking men by whom they could renew the race.
Once there came men from an island far to the north. Six
lived to penetrate the mists and take wives among the
Daughters. Again, they called the yellow-haired men of
another breed, great sea rovers.

"But the Black Ones called too. As the Ancient Ones
searched for the best, the Black Ones brought in great
workers of evil. And, at last, they succeeded in shutting
off the channels of sending thought so that the Ancient
Ones could call no more.

"Then did the Black Ones cross the River of Gold and
enter the land of the Ancient Ones. Thran, Dweller in the
Light and Lord of the Caverns, summoned the Folk to him.

"'There will come one to aid you,' he told us. 'Try the
summoning again after the Black Ones have seemed to win.
Thrala, Daughter of the Light, will not enter into the Room
of Pleasant Death with the rest of the women, but will give
herself into the hands of the Black Ones, that they may
think themselves truly victorious. You of the Folk withdraw
into the Place of Reptiles until the Black Ones are
gone. Nor will all the Ancient Ones perish&mdash;more will be
saved, but the manner of their preservation I dare not tell.
When the sun-haired youth comes from the outer world,
send him into the Caves of Darkness to rescue Thrala and
put an end to evil.'

"And then the Lady Thrala arose and said softly, 'As
the Lord Thran has said, so let it be. I shall deliver myself
into the hands of the Black Ones that their doom may
come upon them.'

"Lord Thran smiled upon her as he said: 'So will happiness
be your portion. After the Great Mists, does not light
come again?'

"The women of the Ancient Ones then took their leave
and passed into the place of Pleasant Death while the men
made ready for battle with the Black Ones. For three
days they fought, but a new weapon of the Black Ones won
the day, and the chief of the Black Ones set up this throne
of jet as proof of his power. Since, however, the Black
Ones were not happy in the Caverns, longing for the darkness
of their caves, they soon withdrew and we, the Folk,
came forth again.

"But now the time has come when the dark ones will
sacrifice the Daughter to their evil. If you can win her
free, outlander, they shall perish as if they had not been."

"What of the Ancient Ones?" asked Garin&mdash;"those
others Thran said would be saved?"

"Of those we know nothing save that when we bore the
bodies of the fallen to the Place of Ancestors there were
some missing. That you may see the truth of this story,
Urg will take you to the gallery above the Room of Pleasant
Death and you may look upon those who sleep there."

Urg guiding, Garin climbed a steep ramp leading from the
Hall of Thrones. This led to a narrow balcony, one side of
which was clear crystal. Urg pointed down.

They were above a long room whose walls were tinted
jade green. On the polished floor were scattered piles of
cushions. Each was occupied by a sleeping woman and
several of these clasped a child in their arms. Their long
hair rippled to the floor, their curved lashes made dark
shadows on pale faces.

"But they are sleeping!" protested Garin.

Urg shook his head. "It is the sleep of death. Twice
each ten hours vapors rise from the floor. Those breathing
them do not wake again, and if they are undisturbed
they will lie thus for a thousand years. Look there&mdash;"

He pointed to the closed double doors of the room.
There lay the first men of the Ancient Ones Garin had seen.
They, too, seemed but asleep, their handsome heads pillowed
on their arms.

"Thran ordered those who remained after the last battle
in the Hall of Thrones to enter the Room of Pleasant Death
that the Black Ones might not torture them for their
beastly pleasures. Thran himself remained behind to close
the door, and so died."

There were no aged among the sleepers. None of the
men seemed to count more than thirty years and many of
them appeared younger. Garin remarked upon this.

"The Ancient Ones appeared thus until the day of their
death, though many lived twice a hundred years. The
light rays kept them so. Even we of the Folk can hold
back age. But come now, our Lord Trar would speak with
you again."


CHAPTER FIVE

Into the Caves of Darkness

Again Garin stood before the jade throne of Trar and
heard the stirring of the multitude of the Folk in the shadows.
Trar was turning a small rod of glittering, greenish
metal around in his soft hands.

"Listen well, outlander," he began, "for little time remains
to us. Within seven days the Great Mists will be
upon us. Then no living thing may venture forth from
shelter and escape death. And before that time Thrala
must be out of the Caves. This rod will be your weapon;
the Black Ones have not its secret. Watch."

Two of the Folk dragged an ingot of metal before him.
He touched it with the rod. Great flakes of rust appeared
to spread across the entire surface. It crumpled away
and one of the Folk trod upon the pile of dust where it
had been.

"Thrala lies in the heart of the Caves but Kepta's men
have grown careless with the years. Enter boldly and
trust to fortune. They know nothing of your coming or of
Thran's words concerning you."

Urg stood forward and held out his hands in appeal.

"What would you, Urg?"

"Lord, I would go with the outlander. He knows nothing
of the Forest of the Morgels or of the Pool of Mud. It is
easy to go astray in the woodland&mdash;"

Trar shook his head. "That may not be. He must go
alone, even as Thran said."

The Ana, which had followed in Garin's shadow all day,
whistled shrilly and stood on tiptoe to tug at his hand.
Trar smiled. "That one may go, its eyes may serve you
well. Urg will guide you to the outer portal of the Place
of Ancestors and set you upon the road to the Caves. Farewell,
outlander, and may the spirits of the Ancient Ones
be with you."

Garin bowed to the ruler of the Folk and turned to follow
Urg. Near the door stood a small group of women.
Sera pressed forward from them, holding out a small bag.

"Outlander," she said hurriedly, "when you look upon
the Daughter speak to her of Sera, for I have awaited her
many years."

He smiled. "That I will."

"If you remember, outlander. I am a great lady among
the Folk and have my share of suitors, yet I think I could
envy the Daughter. Nay, I shall not explain that," she
laughed mockingly. "You will understand in due time.
Here is a packet of food. Now go swiftly that we may
have you among us again before the Mists."

So a woman's farewell sped them on their way. Urg
chose a ramp which led downward. At its foot was a niche
in the rock, above which a rose light burned dimly. Urg
reached within the hollow and drew out a pair of high
buskins which he aided Garin to lace on. They were a
good fit, having been fashioned for a man of the Ancient
Ones.

The passage before them was narrow and crooked.
There was a thick carpet of dust underfoot, patterned by
the prints of the Folk. They rounded a corner and a tall
door loomed out of the gloom. Urg pressed the surface,
there was a click and the stone rolled back.


With the Ana perched on his shoulder and the green rod of destruction in his hand, Garin strode into the gloom of Tav&mdash;pledged
to bring the Daughter out of the Caves of Darkness....

"This is the Place of Ancestors," he announced as he
stepped within.

They were at the end of a colossal hall whose domed
roof disappeared into shadows. Thick pillars of gleaming
crystal divided it into aisles, all leading inward to a raised
dais of oval shape. Filling the aisles were couches and
each soft nest held its sleeper. Near to the door lay the
men and women of the Folk, but closer to the dais were
the Ancient Ones. Here and there a couch bore a double
burden, upon the shoulder of a man was pillowed the drooping
head of a woman. Urg stopped beside such a one.

"See, outlander, here was one who was called from your
world. Marena of the House of Light looked with favor
upon him and their days of happiness were many."

The man on the couch had red-gold hair and on his
upper arm was a heavy band of gold whose mate Garin
had once seen in a museum. A son of pre-Norman Ireland.
Urg traced with a crooked finger the archaic lettering
carved upon the stone base of the couch.

"Lovers in the Light sleep sweetly. The Light returns
on the appointed day."

"Who lies there?" Garin motioned to the dais.

"The first Ancient Ones. Come, look upon those who
made this Tav."

On the dais the couches were arranged in two rows and
between them, in the center, was a single couch raised above
the others. Fifty men and women lay as if but resting
for the hour, smiles on their peaceful faces but weary
shadows beneath their eyes. There was an un-human
quality about them which was lacking in their descendents.

Urg advanced to the high couch and beckoned Garin to
join him. A man and a woman lay there, the woman's
head upon the man's breast. There was that in their faces
which made Garin turn away. He felt as if he had intruded
roughly where no man should go.

"Here lies Thran, Son of Light, first Lord of the Caverns,
and his lady Thrala, Dweller in the Light. So have
they lain a thousand thousand years, and so will they lie
until this planet rots to dust beneath them. They led the
Folk out of the slime and made Tav. Such as they we
shall never see again."

They passed silently down the aisles of the dead. Once
Garin caught sight of another fair-haired man, perhaps
another outlander, since the Ancient Ones were all dark
of hair. Urg paused once more before they left the hall.
He stood by the couch of a man, wrapped in a long robe,
whose face was ravaged with marks of agony.

Urg spoke a single name: "Thran."

So this was the last Lord of the Caverns. Garin leaned
closer to study the dead face but Urg seemed to have lost
his patience. He hurried his charge on to a panel door.

"This is the southern portal of the Caverns," he explained.
"Trust to the Ana to guide you and beware of the boiling
mud. Should the morgels scent you, kill quickly, they
are the servants of the Black Ones. May fortune favor
you, outlander."

The door was open and Garin looked out upon Tav. The
soft blue light was as strong as it had been when he had
first seen it. With the Ana perched on his shoulder, the
green rod and the bag of food in his hands, he stepped
out onto the moss sod.

Urg raised his hand in salute and the door clicked into
place. Garin stood alone, pledged to bring the Daughter
out of the Caves of Darkness.

There is no night or day in Tav since the blue light is
steady. But the Folk divide their time by artificial means.
However Garin, being newly come from the rays of healing,
felt no fatigue. As he hesitated, the Ana chattered
and pointed confidently ahead.

Before them was a dense wood of fern trees. It was
quiet in the forest as Garin made his way into its gloom
and for the first time he noted a peculiarity of Tav. There
were no birds.

The portion of the woodland they had to traverse was
but a spur of the forest to the west. After an hour of
travel they came out upon the bank of a sluggish river.
The turbid waters of the stream were a dull saffron color.
This, thought Garin, must be the River of Gold, the boundary
of the lands of the Black Ones.

He rounded a bend to come upon a bridge, so old that
time itself had worn its stone angles into curves. The
bridge gave on a wide plain where tall grass grew sere and
yellow. To the left was a hissing and bubbling, and a huge
wave of boiling mud arose in the air. Garin choked in a
wind, thick with chemicals, which blew from it. He smelled
and tasted the sulphur-tainted air all across the plain.

And he was glad enough to plunge into a small fern
grove which half-concealed a spring. There he bathed
his head and arms while the Ana pulled open Sera's food
bag.

Together they ate the cakes of grain and the dried fruit.
When they were done the Ana tugged at Garin's hand
and pointed on.

Cautiously Garin wormed his way through the thick underbrush
until, at last, he looked out into a clearing and
at its edge the entrance of the Black Ones' Caves. Two
tall pillars, carved into the likeness of foul monsters, guarded
a rough-edged hole. A fine greenish mist whirled and
danced in its mouth.

The flyer studied the entrance. There was no life to be
seen. He gripped the destroying rod and inched forward.
Before the green mist he braced himself and then stepped
within.


CHAPTER SIX

Kepta's Second Prisoner

The green mist enveloped Garin. He drew into his lungs
hot moist air faintly tinged with a scent of sickly sweetness,
as from some hidden corruption. Green motes in the air
gave forth little light and seemed to cling to the intruder.

With the Ana pattering before him, the American started
down a steep ramp, the soft soles of his buskins making
no sound. At regular intervals along the wall, niches held
small statues. And about each perverted figure was a
crown of green motes.

The Ana stopped, its large ears outspread as if to catch
the faintest murmur of sound. From somewhere under
the earth came the howls of a maddened dog. The Ana
shivered, creeping closer to Garin.

Down led the ramp, growing narrower and steeper. And
louder sounded the insane, coughing howls of the dog.
Then the passage was abruptly barred by a grill of black
stone. Garin peered through its bars at a flight of stairs
leading down into a pit. From the pit arose snarling
laughter.

Padding back and forth were things which might have
been conceived by demons. They were sleek, rat-like creatures,
hairless, and large as ponies. Red saliva dripped
from the corners of their sharp jaws. But in the eyes,
which they raised now and then toward the grill, there was
intelligence. These were the morgels, watchdogs and
slaves of the Black Ones.

From a second pair of stairs directly across the pit arose
a moaning call. A door opened and two men came down
the steps. The morgels surged forward, but fell back when
whips were cracked over their heads.

The masters of the morgels were human in appearance.
Black loin cloths were twisted about them and long, wing-shaped
cloaks hung from their shoulders. On their heads,
completely masking their hair, were cloth caps which bore
ragged crests not unlike cockscombs. As far as Garin
could see they were unarmed except for their whips.

A second party was coming down the steps. Between
two of the Black Ones struggled a prisoner. He made a
desperate and hopeless fight of it, but they dragged him
to the edge of the pit before they halted. The morgels,
intent upon their promised prey, crouched before them.

Five steps above were two figures to whom the guards
looked for instructions. One was a man of their race, of
slender, handsome body and evil, beautiful face. His hand
lay possessively upon the arm of his companion.

It was Thrala who stood beside him, her head proudly
erect. The laughter curves were gone from her lips; there
was only sorrow and resignation to be read there now. But
her spirit burned like a white flame in her eyes.

"Look!" her warder ordered. "Does not Kepta keep his
promises? Shall we give Dandtan into the jaws of our
slaves, or will you unsay certain words of yours, Lady
Thrala?"

The prisoner answered for her. "Kepta, son of vileness,
Thrala is not for you. Remember, beloved one," he spoke
to the Daughter, "the day of deliverance is at hand&mdash;"

Garin felt a sudden emptiness. The prisoner had called
Thrala "beloved" with the ease of one who had the right.

"I await Thrala's answer," Kepta returned evenly. And
her answer he got.

"Beast among beasts, you may send Dandtan to his
death, you may heap all manner of insult and evil upon me,
but still I say the Daughter is not for your touch. Rather
will I cut the line of life with my own hands, taking upon
me the punishment of the Elder Ones. To Dandtan," she
smiled down upon the prisoner, "I say farewell. We shall
meet again beyond the Curtain of Time." She held out
her hands to him.

"Thrala, dear one&mdash;!" One of his guards slapped a hand
over the prisoner's mouth putting an end to his words.

But now Thrala was looking beyond him, straight at the
grill which sheltered Garin. Kepta pulled at her arm to
gain her attention. "Watch! Thus do my enemies die.
To the pit with him!"

The guards twisted their prisoner around and the morgels
crept closer, their eyes fixed upon that young, writhing
body. Garin knew that he must take a hand in the game.
The Ana was tugging him to the right, and there was an
open archway leading to a balcony running around the
side of the pit.

Those below were too entranced by the coming sport to
notice the invader. But Thrala glanced up and Garin
thought that she sighted him. Something in her attitude
attracted Kepta, he too looked up. For a moment he
stared in stark amazement, and then he thrust the Daughter
through the door behind him.

"Ho, outlander! Welcome to the Caves. So the Folk
have meddled&mdash;"

"Greeting, Kepta." Garin hardly knew whence came the
words which fell so easily from his tongue. "I have come
as was promised, to remain until the Black Throne
is no more."

"Not even the morgels boast before their prey lies limp
in their jaws," flashed Kepta. "What manner of beast
are you?"

"A clean beast, Kepta, which you are not. Bid your two-legged
morgels loose the youth, lest I grow impatient."
The flyer swung the green rod into view.

Kepta's eyes narrowed but his smile did not fade. "I have
heard of old that the Ancient Ones do not destroy&mdash;"

"As an outlander I am not bound by their limits," returned
Garin, "as you will learn if you do not call off your
stinking pack."

The master of the Caves laughed. "You are as the Tand,
a fool without a brain. Never shall you see the Caverns
again&mdash;"

"You shall own me master yet, Kepta."

The Black Chief seemed to consider. Then he waved to
his men. "Release him," he ordered. "Outlander, you
are braver than I thought. We might bargain&mdash;"

"Thrala goes forth from the Caves and the black throne
is dust, those are the terms of the Caverns."

"And if we do not accept?"

"Then Thrala goes forth, the throne is dust and Tav shall
have a day of judging such as it has never seen before."

"You challenge me?"

Again words, which seemed to Garin to have their origin
elsewhere, came to him. "As in Yu-Lac, I shall take&mdash;"

Before Kepta could reply there was trouble in the pit.
Dandtan, freed by his guards, was crossing the floor in running
leaps. Garin threw himself belly down on the balcony
and dropped the jeweled strap of his belt over the lip.

A moment later it snapped taut and he stiffened to an
upward pull. Already Dandtan's heels were above the snapping
jaws of a morgel. The flyer caught the youth around
the shoulders and heaved. They rolled together against
the wall.

"They are gone! All of them!" Dandtan cried, as he regained
his feet. He was right; the morgels howled below,
but Kepta and his men had vanished.

"Thrala!" Garin exclaimed.

Dandtan nodded. "They have taken her back to the
cells. They believe her safe there."

"Then they think wrong." Garin stooped to pick up the
green rod. His companion laughed.

"We'd best start before they get prepared for us."

Garin picked up the Ana. "Which way?"

Dandtan showed him a passage leading from behind the
other door. Then he dodged into a side chamber to return
with two of the wing cloaks and cloth hoods, so that they
might pass as Black Ones.

They went by the mouths of three side tunnels, all deserted.
None disputed their going. All the Black Ones had
withdrawn from this part of the Caves.

Dandtan sniffed uneasily. "All is not well. I fear a trap."

"While we can pass, let us."

The passage curved to the right and they came into an
oval room. Again Dandtan shook his head but ventured
no protest. Instead he flung open a door and hurried
down a short hall.

It seemed to Garin that there were strange rustlings and
squeakings in the dark corners. Then Dandtan stopped so
short that the flyer ran into him.

"Here is the guard room&mdash;and it is empty!"

Garin looked over his shoulder into a large room. Racks
of strange weapons hung on the walls and the sleeping pallets
of the guards were stacked evenly, but the men were
nowhere to be seen.

They crossed the room and passed beneath an archway.

"Even the bars are not down," observed Dandtan. He
pointed overhead. There hung a portcullis of stone. Garin
studied it apprehensively. But Dandtan drew him on into
a narrow corridor where were barred doors.

"The cells," he explained, and withdrew a bar across one
door. The portal swung back and they pushed within.


CHAPTER SEVEN

Kepta's Trap

Thrala arose to face them. Forgetting the disguise he
wore, Garin drew back, chilled by her icy demeanor. But
Dandtan sprang forward and caught her in his arms. She
struggled madly until she saw the face beneath her captor's
hood, and then she gave a cry of delight and her arms
were about his neck.

"Dandtan!"

He smiled. "Even so. But it is the outlander's doing."

She came to the American, studying his face. "Outlander?
So cold a name is not for you, when you have served
us so." She offered him her hands and he raised them to
his lips.

"And how are you named?"

Dandtan laughed. "Thus the eternal curiosity of women!"

"Garin."

"Garin," she repeated. "How like&mdash;" A faint rose
glowed beneath her pearl flesh.

Dandtan's hand fell lightly upon his rescuer's shoulder.
"Indeed he is like him. From this day let him bear that
other's name. Garan, Son of Light."

"Why not?" she returned calmly. "After all&mdash;"

"The reward which might have been Garan's may be his?
Tell him the story of his namesake when we are again
in the Caverns&mdash;"

Dandtan was interrupted by a frightened squeak from
the Ana. Then came a mocking voice.

"So the prey has entered the trap of its own will. How
many hunters may boast the same?"

Kepta leaned against the door, the light of vicious mischief
dancing in his eyes. Garin dropped his cloak to the
floor, but Dandtan must have read what was in the flyer's
mind, for he caught him by the arm.

"On your life, touch him not!"

"So you have learned that much wisdom while you have
dwelt among us, Dandtan? Would that Thrala had done
the same. But fair women find me weak." He eyed her
proud body in a way that would have sent Garin at his
throat had Dandtan not held him. "So shall Thrala have
a second chance. How would you like to see these men in
the Room of Instruments, Lady?"

"I do not fear you," she returned. "Thran once made a
prophecy, and he never spoke idly. We shall win free&mdash;"

"That will be as fate would have it. Meanwhile, I leave
you to each other." He whipped around the door and
slammed it behind him. They heard the grating of the bar
he slid into place. Then his footsteps died away.

"There goes evil," murmured Thrala softly. "Perhaps
it would have been better if Garin had killed him as he
thought to do. We must get away...."

Garin drew the rod from his belt. The green light-motes
gathered and clung about its polished length.

"Touch not the door," Thrala advised; "only its hinges."

Beneath the tip of the rod the stone became spongy and
flaked away. Dandtan and the flyer caught the door and
eased it to the floor. With one quick movement Thrala
caught up Garin's cloak and swirled it about her, hiding
the glitter of her gem-encrusted robe.

There was a curious cold lifelessness about the air of the
corridor, the light-bearing motes vanishing as if blown out.

"Hurry!" the Daughter urged. "Kepta is withdrawing
the living light, so that we will have to wander in the dark."

When they reached the end of the hall the light was
quite gone, and Garin bruised his hands against the stone
portcullis which had been lowered. From somewhere on
the other side of the barrier came rippling laughter.

"Oh, outlander," called Kepta mockingly, "you will get
through easily enough when you remember your weapon.
But the dark you can not conquer so easily, nor that which
runs the halls."

Garin was already busy with the rod. Within five minutes
their way was clear again. But Thrala stopped them
when they would have gone through. "Kepta has loosed
the hunters."

"The hunters?"

"The morgels and&mdash;others," explained Dandtan. "The
Black Ones have withdrawn and only death comes this
way. And the morgels see in the dark...."

"So does the Ana."

"Well thought of," agreed the son of the Ancient Ones.

"It will lead us out."

As if in answer, there came a tug at Garin's belt. Reaching
back, he caught Thrala's hand and knew that she had
taken Dandtan's. So linked they crossed the guard room.
Then the Ana paused for a long time, as if listening. There
was nothing to see but the darkness which hung about
them like the smothering folds of a curtain.

"Something follows us," whispered Dandtan.

"Nothing to fear," stated Thrala. "It dare not attack.
It is, I think, of Kepta's fashioning. And that which has
not true life dreads death above all things. It is going&mdash;"

There came sounds of something crawling slowly away.

"Kepta will not try that again," continued the Daughter,
disdainfully. "He knew that his monstrosities would not
attack. Only in the light are they to be dreaded&mdash;and then
only because of the horror of their forms."

Again the Ana tugged at its master's belt. They shuffled
into the narrow passage beyond. But there remained the
sense of things about them in the dark, things which Thrala
continued to insist were harmless and yet which filled
Garin with loathing.

Then they entered the far corridor into which led the
three halls and which ended in the morgel pit. Here, Garin
believed, was the greatest danger from the morgels.

The Ana stopped short, dropping back against Garin's
thigh. In the blackness appeared two yellow disks, sparks
of saffron in their depths. Garin thrust the rod into
Thrala's hands.

"What do you?" she demanded.

"I'm going to clear the way. It's too dark to use the rod
against moving creatures...." He flung the words over
his shoulder as he moved toward the unwinking eyes.


CHAPTER EIGHT

Escape from the Caves

Keeping his eyes upon those soulless yellow disks, Garin
snatched off his hood, wadding it into a ball. Then he
sprang. His fingers slipped on smooth hide, sharp fangs
ripped his forearm, blunt nails scraped his ribs. A foul
breath puffed into his face and warm slaver trickled down
his neck and chest. But his plan succeeded.

The cap was wedged into the morgel's throat and the
beast was slowly choking. Blood dripped from the flyer's
torn flesh, but he held on grimly until he saw the light fade
from those yellow eyes. The dying morgel made a last
mad plunge for freedom, dragging his attacker along the
rock floor. Then Garin felt the heaving body rest limply
against his own. He staggered against the wall, panting.

"Garin!" cried Thrala. Her questing hand touched his
shoulder and crept to his face. "It is well with you?"

"Yes," he panted, "let us go on."

Thrala's fingers had lingered on his arm and now she
walked beside him, her cloak making whispering sounds as
it brushed against the wall and floor.

"Wait," she cautioned suddenly. "The morgel pit...."

Dandtan slipped by them. "I will try the door."

In a moment he was back. "It is open," he whispered.

"Kepta believes," mused Thrala, "that we will keep to
the safety of the gallery. Therefore let us go through the
pit. The morgels will be gone to better hunting grounds."

Through the pit they went. A choking stench arose
from underfoot and they trod very carefully. They climbed
the stairs on the far side unchallenged, Dandtan leading.

"The rod here, Garin," he called; "this door is barred."

Garin pressed the weapon into the other's hand and
leaned against the rock. He was sick and dizzy. The long,
deep wounds on his arm and shoulder were stiffening and
ached with a biting throb.

When they went on he panted with effort. They still
moved in darkness and his distress passed unnoticed.

"This is wrong," he muttered, half to himself. "We go
too easily&mdash;"

And he was answered out of the blackness. "Well noted,
outlander. But you go free for the moment, as does Thrala
and Dandtan. Our full accounting is not yet. And now,
farewell, until we meet again in the Hall of Thrones. I
could find it in me to applaud your courage, outlander.
Perhaps you will come to serve me yet."

Garin turned and threw himself toward the voice, bringing
up with bruising force against rock wall. Kepta laughed.

"Not with the skill of the bull Tand will you capture me."

His second laugh was cut cleanly off, as if a door had
been closed. In silence the three hurried up the ramp.
Then, as through a curtain, they came into the light of Tav.

Thrala let fall her drab cloak, stood with arms outstretched
in the crater land. Her sparkling robe sheathed
her in glory and she sang softly, rapt in her own delight.
Then Dandtan put his arm about her; she clung to him,
staring about as might a beauty-bewildered child.

Garin wondered dully how he would be able to make the
journey back to the Caverns when his arm and shoulder
were eaten with a consuming fire. The Ana crept closer
to him, peering into his white face.

They were aroused by a howl from the Caves. Thrala
cried out and Dandtan answered her unspoken question.
"They have set the morgels on our trail!"

The howl from the Caves was echoed from the forest.
Morgels before and behind them! Garin might set himself
against one, Dandtan another, and Thrala could defend herself
with the rod, but in the end the pack would kill them.

"We shall claim protection from the Gibi of the cliff. By
the law they must give us aid," said Thrala, as, turning up
her long robe, she began to run lightly. Garin picked up
her cloak and drew it across his shoulder to hide his welts.
When he could no longer hold her pace she must not guess
the reason for his falling behind.

Of that flight through the forest the flyer afterward remembered
little. At last the gurgle of water broke upon
his pounding ears, as he stumbled along a good ten lengths
behind his companions. They had come to the edge of the
wood along the banks of the river.

Without hesitation Thrala and Dandtan plunged into the
oily flood, swimming easily for the other side. Garin dropped
the cloak, wondering if, once he stepped into the yellow
stream, he would ever be able to struggle out again. Already
the Ana was in, paddling in circles near the shore
and pleading with him to follow. Wearily Garin waded out.

The water, which washed the blood and sweat from his
aching body, was faintly brackish and stung his wounds to
life. He could not fight the sluggish current and it bore
him downstream, well away from where the others landed.

But at last he managed to win free, crawling out near
where a smaller stream joined the river. There he lay
panting, face down upon the moss. And there they found
him, water dripping from his bedraggled finery, the Ana
stroking his muddied hair. Thrala cried out with concern
and pillowed his head on her knees while Dandtan examined
his wounds.

"Why did you not tell us?" demanded Thrala.

He did not try to answer, content to lie there, her arms
supporting him. Dandtan disappeared into the forest, returning
soon, his hands filled with a mass of crushed leaves.
With these he plastered Garin's wounds.

"You'd better go on," Garin warned.

Dandtan shook his head. "The morgels can not swim.
If they cross, they must go to the bridge, and that is half
the crater away."

The Ana dropped into their midst, its small hands filled
with clusters of purple fruit. And so they feasted, Garin
at ease on a fern couch, accepting food from Thrala's hand.

There seemed to be some virtue in Dandtan's leaf plaster
for, after a short rest, Garin was able to get to his feet
with no more than a twinge or two in his wounds. But
they started on at a more sober pace. Through mossy
glens and sunlit glades where strange flowers made perfume,
the trail led. The stream they followed branched
twice before, on the edge of meadow land, they struck away
from the guiding water toward the crater wall.

Suddenly Thrala threw back her head and gave a shrill,
sweet whistle. Out of the air dropped a yellow and black
insect, as large as a hawk. Twice it circled her head and
then perched itself on her outstretched wrist.

Its swollen body was jet black, its curving legs, three to a
side, chrome yellow. The round head ended in a sharp
beak and it had large, many-faceted eyes. The wings, which
lazily tested the air, were black and touched with gold.

Thrala rubbed the round head while the insect nuzzled
affectionately at her cheek. Then she held out her wrist
again and it was gone.

"We shall be expected now and may pass unmolested."

Shortly they became aware of a murmuring sound. The
crater wall loomed ahead, dwarfing the trees at its base.

"There is the city of the Gibi," remarked Dandtan.

Clinging to the rock were the towers and turrets of many
eight-sided cells.

"They are preparing for the Mists," observed Thrala.
"We shall have company on our journey to the Caverns."

They passed the trees and reached the foot of the wax
skyscrapers which towered dizzily above their heads. A
great cloud of the Gibi hovered about them. Garin felt the
soft brush of their wings against his body. And they crowded
each other jealously to be near Thrala.

The soft hush-hush of their wings filled the clearing as
one large Gibi of outstanding beauty approached. The
commoners fluttered off and Thrala greeted the Queen of
the cells as an equal. Then she turned to her companions
with the information the Gibi Queen had to offer.

"We are just in time. Tomorrow the Gibi leave. The
morgels have crossed the river and are out of control. Instead
of hunting us they have gone to ravage the forest
lands. All Tav has been warned against them. But they
may be caught by the Mist and so destroyed. We are to
rest in the cliff hollows, and one shall come for us when it
is time to leave."

The Gibi withdrew to the cell-combs after conducting
their guests to the rock-hollows.


CHAPTER NINE

Days of Preparation

Garin was awakened by a loud murmuring. Dandtan
knelt beside him.

"We must go. Even now the Gibi seal the last of the cells."

They ate hurriedly of cakes of grain and honey, and, as
they feasted, the Queen again visited them. The first of
the swarm were already winging eastward.

With the Gibi nation hanging like a storm cloud above
them, the three started off across the meadow. The purple-blue
haze was thickening and, here and there, curious
formations, like the dust devils of the desert, arose and
danced and disappeared again. The tropic heat of Tav
increased; it was as if the ground itself were steaming.

"The Mists draw close; we must hurry," panted Dandtan.

They traversed the tongue of forest which bordered the
meadow and came to the central plain of Tav. There was
a brooding stillness there. The Ana, perched on Garin's
shoulder, shivered.

Their walk became a trot; the Gibi bunched together.
Once Thrala caught her breath in a half sob.

"They are flying slowly because of us. And it's so far&mdash;"

"Look!" Dandtan pointed at the plain. "The morgels!"

The morgel pack, driven by fear, ran in leaping bounds.
They passed within a hundred yards of the three, yet did
not turn from their course, though several snarled at them.

"They are already dead," observed Dandtan. "There is
no time for them to reach the shelter of the Caves."

Splashing through a shallow brook, the three began to
run. For the first time Thrala faltered and broke pace.
Garin thrust the Ana into Dandtan's arms and, before she
could protest, swept the girl into his arms.

The haze was denser now, settling upon them as a curtain.
Black hair, finer than silk, whipped across Garin's
throat. Thrala's head was on his shoulder, her heaving
breasts arched as she gasped the sultry air.

"They&mdash;keep&mdash;watch...!" shouted Dandtan.

Piercing the gloom were pin-points of light. A dark
shape grazed Garin's head&mdash;one of the Gibi Queen's guards.

Then abruptly they stumbled into a throng of the Folk,
one of whom reached for Thrala with a crooning cry. It
was Sera welcoming her mistress.

Thrala was borne away by the women, leaving Garin with
a feeling of desolation.

"The Mists, Outlander." It was Urg, pointing toward
the Cavern mouth. Two of the Folk swung their weight
on a lever. Across the opening a sheet of crystal clicked
into place. The Caverns were sealed.

The haze was now inky black outside and billows of it
beat against the protecting barrier. It might have been
midnight of the blackest, starless night.

"So will it be for forty days. What is without&mdash;dies,"
said Urg.

"Then we have forty days in which to prepare," Garin
spoke his thought aloud. Dandtan's keen face lightened.

"Well said, Garin. Forty days before Kepta may seek
us. And we have much to do. But first, our respects to
the Lord of the Folk."

Together they went to the Hall of Thrones where, when
he saw Dandtan, Trar arose and held out his jade-tipped
rod of office. The son of the Ancient Ones touched it.

"Hail! Dweller in the Light, and Outlander who has fulfilled
the promise of Thran. Thrala is once more within
the Caverns. Now send you to dust this black throne...."

Garin, nothing loath, drew the destroying rod from his
belt, but Dandtan shook his head. "The time is not yet,
Trar. Kepta must finish the pattern he began. Forty
days have we and then the Black Ones come."

Trar considered thoughtfully. "So that be the way of
it. Thran did not see another war...."

"But he saw an end to Kepta!"

Trar straightened as if some burden had rolled from his
thin shoulders. "Well do you speak, Lord. When there is
one to sit upon the Rose Throne, what have we to fear?
Listen, O ye Folk, the Light has returned to the Caverns!"

His cry was echoed by the gathering of the Folk.

"And now, Lord&mdash;" he turned to Dandtan with deference&mdash;"what
are your commands?"

"For the space of one sleep I shall enter the Chamber of
Renewing with this outlander, who is no longer an outlander
but one, Garin, accepted by the Daughter according
to the Law. And while we rest let all be made ready...."

"The Dweller in the Light has spoken!" Trar himself
escorted them from the Hall.

They came, through many winding passages, to a deep
pool of water, in the depths of which lurked odd purple
shadows. Dandtan stripped and plunged in, Garin following
his example. The water was tinglingly alive and they did
not linger in it long. From it they went to a bubble room
such as the one Garin had rested in after the bath of light
rays, and on the cushions in its center stretched their tired
bodies.

When Garin awoke he experienced the same exultation
he had felt before. Dandtan regarded him with a smile.
"Now to work," he said, as he reached out to press a knob
set in the wall.

Two of the Folk appeared, bringing with them clean
trappings. After they dressed and broke their fast, Dandtan
started for the laboratories. Garin would have gone
with him, but Sera intercepted them.

"There is one would speak with Lord Garin...."

Dandtan laughed. "Go," he ordered the American.
"Thrala's commands may not be slighted."

The Hall of Women was deserted. And the corridor beyond,
roofed and walled with slabs of rose-shot crystal,
was as empty. Sera drew aside a golden curtain and they
were in the audience chamber of the Daughter.

A semi-circular dais of the clearest crystal, heaped with
rose and gold cushions, faced them. Before it, a fountain,
in the form of a flower nodding on a curved stem, sent a
spray of water into a shallow basin. The walls of the
room were divided into alcoves by marble pillars, each one
curved in semblance of a fern frond.

From the domed ceiling, on chains of twisted gold, seven
lamps, each wrought from a single yellow sapphire, gave
soft light. The floor was a mosaic of gold and crystal.

Two small Anas, who had been playing among the cushions,
pattered up to exchange greetings with Garin's. But of
the mistress of the chamber there was no sign. Garin turned
to Sera, but before he could phrase his question, she
asked mockingly:

"Who is the Lord Garin that he can not wait with patience?"
But she left in search of the Daughter.

Garin glanced uneasily about the room. This jeweled
chamber was no place for him. He had started toward the
door when Thrala stepped within.

"Greetings to the Daughter." His voice sounded formal
and cold, even to himself.

Her hands, which had been outheld in welcome, dropped
to her sides. A ghost of a frown dimmed her beauty.

"Greetings, Garin," she returned slowly.

"You sent for me&mdash;" he prompted, eager to escape from
this jewel box and the unattainable treasure it held.

"Yes," the coldness of her tone was an order of exile. "I
would know how you fared and whether your wounds yet
troubled you."

He looked down at his own smooth flesh, cleanly healed
by the wisdom of the Folk. "I am myself again and eager
to be at such work as Dandtan can find for me...."

Her robe seemed to hiss across the floor as she turned
upon him. "Then go!" she ordered. "Go quickly!"

And blindly he obeyed. She had spoken as if to a servant,
one whom she could summon and dismiss by whim. Even
if Dandtan held her love, she might have extended him her
friendship. But he knew within him that friendship would
be a poor crumb beside the feast his pulses pounded for.

There was a pattering of feet behind him. So, she would
call him back! His pride sent him on. But it was Sera.
Her head thrust forward until she truly resembled a reptile.

"Fool! Morgel!" she spat. "Even the Black Ones did
not treat her so. Get you out of the Place of Women lest
they divide your skin among them!"

Garin broke free, not heeding her torrent of reproach.
Then he seized upon one of the Folk as a guide and sought
the laboratories. Far beneath the surface of Tav, where
the light-motes shone ghostly in the gloom, they came into
a place of ceaseless activity, where there were tables crowded
with instruments, coils of glass and metal tubing, and
other equipment and supplies. These were the focusing
point for ceaseless streams of the Folk. On a platform at
the far end, Garin saw the tall son of the Ancient Ones
working on a framework of metal and shining crystal.

He glanced up as Garin joined him. "You are late," he
accused. "But your excuse is a good one. Now get you
to work. Hold this here&mdash;and here&mdash;while I fasten these
clamps."

So Garin became extra hands and feet for Dandtan, and
they worked feverishly to build against the lifting of the
Mists. There was no day or night in the laboratories. They
worked steadily without rest, and without feeling fatigue.

Twice they went to the Chamber of Renewing, but except
for these trips to the upper ways they were not out of
the laboratories through all those days. Of Thrala there
was no sign, nor did any one speak of her.

The Cavern dwellers were depending upon two defenses:
an evil green liquid, to be thrown in frail glass globes, and
a screen charged with energy. Shortly before the lifting
of the Mists, these arms were transported to the entrance
and installed there. Dandtan and Garin made a last inspection.

"Kepta makes the mistake of under-rating his enemies,"
Dandtan reflected, feeling the edge of the screen caressingly.
"When I was captured, on the day my people died, I
was sent to the Black Ones' laboratories so that their seekers
after knowledge might learn the secrets of the Ancient
Ones. But I proved a better pupil than teacher and I discovered
the defense against the Black Fire. After I had
learned that, Kepta grew impatient with my supposed stupidity
and tried to use me to force Thrala to his will. For
that, as for other things, shall he pay&mdash;and the paying will
not be in coin of his own striking. Let us think of that...."
He turned to greet Urg and Trar and the other leaders of
the Folk, who had approached unnoticed.

Among them stood Thrala, her gaze fixed upon the crystal
wall between them and the thinning Mist. She noticed
Garin no more than she did the Anas playing with her train
and the women whispering behind her. But Garin stepped
back into the shadows&mdash;and what he saw was not weapons
of war, but cloudy black hair and graceful white limbs veiled
in splendor.

Urg and one of the other chieftains bore down upon the
door lever. With a protesting squeak, the glass wall disappeared
into the rock. The green of Tav beckoned them
out to walk in its freshness; it was renewed with lusty life.
But in all that expanse of meadow and forest there was a
strange stillness.

"Post sentries," ordered Dandtan. "The Black Ones
will come soon."

He beckoned Garin forward as he spoke to Thrala:

"Let us go to the Hall of Thrones."

But the Daughter did not answer his smile. "It is not
meet that we should spend time in idle talk. Let us go instead
to call upon the help of those who have gone before
us." So speaking, she darted a glance at Garin as chill as
the arctic lands beyond the lip of Tav, and then swept away
with Sera bearing her train.

Dandtan stared at Garin. "What has happened between
you two?"

The flyer shook his head. "I don't know. No man is
born with an understanding of women&mdash;"

"But she is angered with you. What has happened?"

For a moment Garin was tempted to tell the truth: that
he dared not break any barrier she chose to raise, lest he
seize what in honor was none of his. But he shook his
head mutely. Neither of them saw Thrala again until
Death entered the Caverns.


CHAPTER TEN

Battle and Victory

Garin stood with Dandtan looking out into the plain of
Tav. Some distance away were two slender, steel-tipped
towers, which were, in reality, but hollow tubes filled with
the Black Fire. Before these dark-clad figures were busy.

"They seem to believe us already defeated. Let them
think so," commented Dandtan, touching the screen they
had erected before the Cavern entrance.

As he spoke Kepta swaggered through the tall grass to
call a greeting:

"Ho, rock dweller, I would speak with you&mdash;"

Dandtan edged around the screen, Garin a pace behind.

"I see you, Kepta."

"Good. I trust that your ears will serve you as well as
your eyes. These are my terms: Give Thrala to me to
dwell in my chamber and the outlander to provide sport
for my captains. Make no resistance but throw open the
Caverns so that I may take my rightful place in the Hall of
Thrones. Do this and we shall be at peace...."

"And this is our reply:"&mdash;Dandtan stood unmovingly before
the screen&mdash;"Return to the Caves; break down the
bridge between your land and ours. Let no Black One
come hither again, ever...."

Kepta laughed. "So, that be the way of it! Then this
shall we do: take Thrala, to be mine for a space, and then
to go to my captains&mdash;"

Garin hurled himself forward, felt Kepta's lips mash beneath
his fist; his fingers were closing about the other's
throat as Dandtan, who was trying to pull him away from
his prey, shouted a warning: "Watch out!"

A morgel had leaped from the grass, its teeth snapping
about Garin's wrist, forcing him to drop Kepta. Then
Dandtan laid it senseless by a sharp blow with his belt.

On hands and knees Kepta crawled back to his men.
The lower part of his face was a red and dripping smear.
He screamed an order with savage fury.

Dandtan drew the still raging flyer behind the screen.
"Be a little prudent," he panted. "Kepta can be dealt with
in other ways than with bare hands."

The towers were swinging their tips toward the entrance.
Dandtan ordered the screen wedged tightly into place.

Outside, the morgel Dandtan had stunned got groggily
to its feet. When it had limped half the distance back to
its master, Kepta gave the order to fire. The broad beam
of black light from the tip of the nearest tower caught the
beast head on. There was a chilling scream of agony, and
where the morgel had stood gray ashes drifted on the wind.

A hideous crackling arose as the black beam struck the
screen. Green grass beneath seared away, leaving only
parched earth and naked blue soil. Those within the Cavern
crouched behind their frail protection, half blinded by
the light from the seared grass, coughing from the chemical-ridden
fumes which curled about the cracks of the rock.

Then the beam faded out. Thin smoke plumed from the
tips of the towers, steam arose from the blackened ground.
Dandtan drew a deep breath.

"It held!" he cried, betraying at last the fear which had
ridden him.

Men of the Folk dragged engines of tubing before the
screen, while others brought forth the globes of green
liquid. Dandtan stood aside, as if this matter were the
business of the Folk alone, and Garin recalled that the Ancient
Ones were opposed to the taking of life.

Trar was in command now. At his orders the globes
were posed on spoon-shaped holders. Loopholes in the
screen clicked open. Trar brought down his hand in signal.
The globes arose lazily, sliding through the loopholes
and floating out toward the towers.

One, aimed short, struck the ground where the fire had
burned it bare, and broke. The liquid came forth, sluggishly,
forming a gray-green gas as the air struck it. Another
spiral of gas arose almost at the foot of one of the
towers&mdash;and then another ... and another.

There quickly followed a tortured screaming, which soon
dwindled to a weak yammering. They could see shapes,
no longer human or animal, staggering about in the fog.

Dandtan turned away, his face white with horror. Garin's
hands were over his ears to shut out that crying.

At last it was quiet; there was no more movement by the
towers. Urg placed a sphere of rosy light upon the nearest
machine and flipped it out into the camp of the enemy. As
if it were a magnet it drew the green tendrils of gas, to
leave the air clear. Here and there lay shrunken, livid
shapes, the towers brooding over them.

One of the Folk burst into their midst, a woman of
Thrala's following.

"Haste!" She clawed at Garin. "Kepta takes Thrala!"

She ran wildly back the way she had come, with the
American pounding at her heels. They burst into the Hall
of Thrones and saw a struggling group before the dais.

Garin heard someone howl like an animal, became aware
the sound came from his own throat. For the second time
his fist found its mark on Kepta's face. With a shriek of
rage the Black One threw Thrala from him and sprang at
Garin, his nails tearing gashes in the flyer's face. Twice
the American twisted free and sent bone-crushing blows
into the other's ribs. Then he got the grip he wanted, and
his fingers closed around Kepta's throat. In spite of the
Black One's struggles he held on until a limp body rolled
beneath him.

Panting, the American pulled himself up from the blood-stained
floor and grabbed the arm of the Jade Throne for
support.

"Garin!" Thrala's arms were about him, her pitying
fingers on his wounds. And in that moment he forgot
Dandtan, forgot everything he had steeled himself to remember.
She was in his arms and his mouth sought hers
possessively. Nor was she unresponsive, but yielded, as
a flower yields to the wind.

"Garin!" she whispered softly. Then, almost shyly, she
broke from his hold.

Beyond her stood Dandtan, his face white, his mouth
tight. Garin remembered. And, a little mad with pain
and longing, he dropped his eyes, trying not to see the loveliness
which was Thrala.

"So, Outlander, Thrala flies to your arms&mdash;"

Garin whirled about. Kepta was hunched on the broad
seat of the jet throne.

"No, I am not dead, Outlander&mdash;nor shall you kill me,
as you think to do. I go now, but I shall return. We have
met and hated, fought and died before&mdash;you and I. You
were a certain Garan, Marshall of the air fleet of Yu-Lac on
a vanished world, and I was Lord of Koom. That was in the
days before the Ancient Ones pioneered space. You and I
and Thrala, we are bound together and even fate can not
break those bonds. Farewell, Garin. And do you, Thrala,
remember the ending of that other Garan. It was not an
easy one."

With a last malicious chuckle, he leaned back in the
throne. His battered body slumped. Then the sharp lines
of the throne blurred; it shimmered in the light. Abruptly
then both it and its occupant were gone. They were staring
at empty space, above which loomed the rose throne of
the Ancient Ones.

"He spoke true," murmured Thrala. "We have had other
lives, other meetings&mdash;so will we meet again. But for the
present he returns to the darkness which sent him forth.
It is finished."

Without warning, a low rumbling filled the Cavern; the
walls rocked and swayed. Lizard and human, they huddled
together until the swaying stopped. Finally a runner appeared
with news that one of the Gibi had ventured forth
and discovered that the Caves of Darkness had been sealed
by an underground quake. The menace of the Black Ones
was definitely at an end.


CHAPTER ELEVEN

Thrala's Mate

Although there were falls of rock within the Caverns
and some of the passages were closed, few of the Folk suffered
injury. Gibi scouts reported that the land about the
entrance to the Caves had sunk, and that the River of Gold,
thrown out of its bed, was fast filling this basin to form a
lake.

As far as they could discover, none of the Black Ones had
survived the battle and the sealing of the Caves. But they
could not be sure that there was not a handful of outlaws
somewhere within the confines of Tav.

The Crater itself was changed. A series of raw hills
had appeared in the central plain. The pool of boiling mud
had vanished and trees in the forest lay flat, as if cut by a
giant scythe.

Upon their return to the cliff city, the Gibi found most
of their wax skyscrapers in ruins, but they set about rebuilding
without complaint. The squirrel farmers emerged
from their burrows and were again busy in the fields.

Garin felt out of place in all the activity that filled the
Caverns. More than ever he was the outlander with no
true roots in Tav. Restlessly, he explored the Caverns,
spending many hours in the Place of Ancestors, where he
studied those men of the outer world who had preceded
him into this weird land.

One night when he came back to his chamber he found
Dandtan and Trar awaiting him there. There was a curious
hardness in Dandtan's attitude, a somber sobriety in
Trar's carriage.

"Have you sought the Hall of Women since the battle?"
demanded the son of the Ancient Ones abruptly.

"No," retorted Garin shortly. Did Dandtan accuse him
of double dealing?

"Have you sent a message to Thrala?"

Garin held back his rising temper. "I have not ventured
where I can not."

Dandtan nodded to Trar as if his suspicions had been
confirmed. "You see how it stands, Trar."

Trar shook his head slowly. "But never has the summoning
been at fault&mdash;"

"You forget," Dandtan reminded him sharply. "It was
once&mdash;and the penalty was exacted. So shall it be again."

Garin looked from one to the other, confused. Dandtan
seemed possessed of a certain ruthless anger, but Trar
was manifestly unhappy.

"It must come after council, the Daughter willing," the
Lord of the Folk said.

Dandtan strode toward the door. "Thrala is not to
know. Assemble the Council tonight. Meanwhile, see that
he," he jerked his thumb toward Garin, "does not leave
this room."

Thus Garin became a prisoner under the guard of the
Folk, unable to discover of what Dandtan accused him, or
how he had aroused the hatred of the Cavern ruler. Unless
Dandtan's jealousy had been aroused and he was determined
to rid himself of a rival.

Believing this, the flyer went willingly to the chamber
where the judges waited. Dandtan sat at the head of a
long table, Trar at his right hand and lesser nobles of the
Folk beyond.

"You know the charge," Dandtan's words were tipped
with venom as Garin came to stand before him. "Out of
his own mouth has this outlander condemned himself.
Therefore I ask that you decree for him the fate of that
outlander of the second calling who rebelled against the
summoning."

"The outlander has admitted his fault?" questioned one
of the Folk.

Trar inclined his head sadly. "He did."

As Garin opened his mouth to demand a stating of the
charge against him, Dandtan spoke again:

"What say you, Lords?"

For a long moment they sat in silence and then they bobbed
their lizard heads in assent. "Do as you desire, Dweller
in the Light."

Dandtan smiled without mirth. "Look, outlander." He
passed his hand over the glass of the seeing mirror set in
the table top. "This is the fate of him who rebels&mdash;"

In the shining surface Garin saw pictured a break in
Tav's wall. At its foot stood a group of men of the Ancient
Ones, and in their midst struggled a prisoner. They
were forcing him to climb the crater wall. Garin watched
him reach the lip and crawl over, to stagger across the
steaming rock, dodging the scalding vapor of hot springs,
until he pitched face down in the slimy mud.

"Such was his ending, and so will you end&mdash;"

The calm brutality of that statement aroused Garin's
anger. "Rather would I die that way than linger in this
den," he cried hotly. "You, who owe your life to me, would
send me to such a death without even telling me of what I
am accused. Little is there to choose between you and
Kepta, after all&mdash;except that he was an open enemy!"

Dandtan sprang to his feet, but Trar caught his arm.

"He speaks fairly. Ask him why he will not fulfill the
summoning."

While Dandtan hesitated, Garin leaned across the table,
flinging his words, weapon-like, straight into that cold face.

"I'll admit that I love Thrala&mdash;have loved her since that
moment when I saw her on the steps of the morgel pit in
the caves. Since when has it become a crime to love that
which may not be yours&mdash;if you do not try to take it?"

Trar released Dandtan, his golden eyes gleaming.

"If you love her, claim her. It is your right."

"Do I not know," Garin turned to him, "that she is
Dandtan's. Thran had no idea of Dandtan's survival when
he laid his will upon her. Shall I stoop to holding her to
an unwelcome bargain? Let her go to the one she loves...."

Dandtan's face was livid, and his hands, resting on the
table, trembled. One by one the lords of the Folk slipped
away, leaving the two face-to-face.

"And I thought to order you to your death." Dandtan's
whisper was husky as it emerged between dry lips. "Garin,
we thought you knew&mdash;and, knowing, had refused her."

"Knew what?"



"That I am Thran's son&mdash;and Thrala's brother."

The floor swung beneath Garin's unsteady feet. Dandtan's
hands were warm on his shoulders.

"I am a fool," said the American slowly.

Dandtan smiled. "A very honorable fool! Now get you
to Thrala, who deserves to hear the full of this tangle."

So it was that, with Dandtan by his side, Garin walked
for the second time down that hallway, to pass the golden
curtains and stand in the presence of the Daughter. She
came straight from her cushions into his arms when she
read what was in his face. They needed no words.

And in that hour began Garin's life in Tav.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
