    <p>
      They had all known him as a shiftless, worthless creature. From the time
      he first entered Redwood Camp, carrying his entire effects in a red
      handkerchief on the end of a long-handled shovel, until he lazily drifted
      out of it on a plank in the terrible inundation of '56, they never
      expected anything better of him. In a community of strong men with sullen
      virtues and charmingly fascinating vices, he was tolerated as possessing
      neither&mdash;not even rising by any dominant human weakness or ludicrous
      quality to the importance of a butt. In the dramatis personae of Redwood
      Camp he was a simple "super"&mdash;who had only passive, speechless roles
      in those fierce dramas that were sometimes unrolled beneath its
      green-curtained pines. Nameless and penniless, he was overlooked by the
      census and ignored by the tax collector, while in a hotly-contested
      election for sheriff, when even the head-boards of the scant cemetery were
      consulted to fill the poll-lists, it was discovered that neither candidate
      had thought fit to avail himself of his actual vote. He was debarred the
      rude heraldry of a nickname of achievement, and in a camp made up of
      "Euchre Bills," "Poker Dicks," "Profane Pete," and "Snap-shot Harry," was
      known vaguely as "him," "Skeesicks," or "that coot." It was remembered
      long after, with a feeling of superstition, that he had never even met
      with the dignity of an accident, nor received the fleeting honor of a
      chance shot meant for somebody else in any of the liberal and broadly
      comprehensive encounters which distinguished the camp. And the inundation
      that finally carried him out of it was partly anticipated by his passive
      incompetency, for while the others escaped&mdash;or were drowned in
      escaping&mdash;he calmly floated off on his plank without an opposing
      effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all that, Elijah Martin&mdash;which was his real name&mdash;was far
      from being unamiable or repellent. That he was cowardly, untruthful,
      selfish, and lazy, was undoubtedly the fact; perhaps it was his peculiar
      misfortune that, just then, courage, frankness, generosity, and activity
      were the dominant factors in the life of Redwood Camp. His submissive
      gentleness, his unquestioned modesty, his half refinement, and his amiable
      exterior consequently availed him nothing against the fact that he was
      missed during a raid of the Digger Indians, and lied to account for it; or
      that he lost his right to a gold discovery by failing to make it good
      against a bully, and selfishly kept this discovery from the knowledge of
      the camp. Yet this weakness awakened no animosity in his companions, and
      it is probable that the indifference of the camp to his fate in this final
      catastrophe came purely from a simple forgetfulness of one who at that
      supreme moment was weakly incapable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the reputation and such the antecedents of the man who, on the
      15th of March, 1856, found himself adrift in a swollen tributary of the
      Minyo. A spring freshet of unusual volume had flooded the adjacent river
      until, bursting its bounds, it escaped through the narrow, wedge-shaped
      valley that held Redwood Camp. For a day and night the surcharged river
      poured half its waters through the straggling camp. At the end of that
      time every vestige of the little settlement was swept away; all that was
      left was scattered far and wide in the country, caught in the hanging
      branches of water-side willows and alders, embayed in sluggish pools,
      dragged over submerged meadows, and one fragment&mdash;bearing up Elijah
      Martin&mdash;pursuing the devious courses of an unknown tributary fifty
      miles away. Had he been a rash, impatient man, he would have been speedily
      drowned in some earlier desperate attempt to reach the shore; had he been
      an ordinary bold man, he would have succeeded in transferring himself to
      the branches of some obstructing tree; but he was neither, and he clung to
      his broken raft-like berth with an endurance that was half the paralysis
      of terror and half the patience of habitual misfortune. Eventually he was
      caught in a side current, swept to the bank, and cast ashore on an
      unexplored wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first consciousness was one of hunger that usurped any sentiment of
      gratitude for his escape from drowning. As soon as his cramped limbs
      permitted, he crawled out of the bushes in search of food. He did not know
      where he was; there was no sign of habitation&mdash;or even occupation&mdash;anywhere.
      He had been too terrified to notice the direction in which he had drifted&mdash;even
      if he had possessed the ordinary knowledge of a backwoodsman, which he did
      not. He was helpless. In his bewildered state, seeing a squirrel cracking
      a nut on the branch of a hollow tree near him, he made a half-frenzied
      dart at the frightened animal, which ran away. But the same association of
      ideas in his torpid and confused brain impelled him to search for the
      squirrel's hoard in the hollow of the tree. He ate the few hazel-nuts he
      found there, ravenously. The purely animal instinct satisfied, he seemed
      to have borrowed from it a certain strength and intuition. He limped
      through the thicket not unlike some awkward, shy quadrumane, stopping here
      and there to peer out through the openings over the marshes that lay
      beyond. His sight, hearing, and even the sense of smell had become
      preternaturally acute. It was the latter which suddenly arrested his steps
      with the odor of dried fish. It had a significance beyond the mere
      instincts of hunger&mdash;it indicated the contiguity of some Indian
      encampment. And as such&mdash;it meant danger, torture, and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, trembled violently, and tried to collect his scattered senses.
      Redwood Camp had embroiled itself needlessly and brutally with the
      surrounding Indians, and only held its own against them by reckless
      courage and unerring marksmanship. The frequent use of a casual wandering
      Indian as a target for the practising rifles of its members had kept up an
      undying hatred in the heart of the aborigines and stimulated them to
      terrible and isolated reprisals. The scalped and skinned dead body of Jack
      Trainer, tied on his horse and held hideously upright by a cross of wood
      behind his saddle, had passed, one night, a slow and ghastly apparition,
      into camp; the corpse of Dick Ryner had been found anchored on the
      river-bed, disembowelled and filled with stone and gravel. The solitary
      and unprotected member of Redwood Camp who fell into the enemy's hands was
      doomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elijah Martin remembered this, but his fears gradually began to subside in
      a certain apathy of the imagination, which, perhaps, dulled his
      apprehensions and allowed the instinct of hunger to become again
      uppermost. He knew that the low bark tents, or wigwams, of the Indians
      were hung with strips of dried salmon, and his whole being was new
      centered upon an attempt to stealthily procure a delicious morsel. As yet
      he had distinguished no other sign of life or habitation; a few moments
      later, however, and grown bolder with an animal-like trustfulness in his
      momentary security, he crept out of the thicket and found himself near a
      long, low mound or burrow-like structure of mud and bark on the
      river-bank. A single narrow opening, not unlike the entrance of an
      Esquimau hut, gave upon the river. Martin had no difficulty in recognizing
      the character of the building. It was a "sweathouse," an institution
      common to nearly all the aboriginal tribes of California. Half a religious
      temple, it was also half a sanitary asylum, was used as a Russian bath or
      superheated vault, from which the braves, sweltering and stifling all
      night, by smothered fires, at early dawn plunged, perspiring, into the
      ice-cold river. The heat and smoke were further utilized to dry and cure
      the long strips of fish hanging from the roof, and it was through the
      narrow aperture that served as a chimney that the odor escaped which
      Martin had detected. He knew that as the bathers only occupied the house
      from midnight to early morn, it was now probably empty. He advanced
      confidently toward it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a little surprised to find that the small open space between it and
      the river was occupied by a rude scaffolding, like that on which certain
      tribes exposed their dead, but in this instance it only contained the
      feathered leggings, fringed blanket, and eagle-plumed head-dress of some
      brave. He did not, however, linger in this plainly visible area, but
      quickly dropped on all fours and crept into the interior of the house.
      Here he completed his feast with the fish, and warmed his chilled limbs on
      the embers of the still smouldering fires. It was while drying his
      tattered clothes and shoeless feet that he thought of the dead brave's
      useless leggings and moccasins, and it occurred to him that he would be
      less likely to attract the Indians' attention from a distance and provoke
      a ready arrow, if he were disguised as one of them. Crawling out again, he
      quickly secured, not only the leggings, but the blanket and head-dress,
      and putting them on, cast his own clothes into the stream. A bolder, more
      energetic, or more provident man would have followed the act by quickly
      making his way back to the thicket to reconnoitre, taking with him a
      supply of fish for future needs. But Elijah Martin succumbed again to the
      recklessness of inertia; he yielded once more to the animal instinct of
      momentary security. He returned to the interior of the hut, curled himself
      again on the ashes, and weakly resolving to sleep until moonrise, and as
      weakly hesitating, ended by falling into uneasy but helpless stupor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he awoke, the rising sun, almost level with the low entrance to the
      sweat-house, was darting its direct rays into the interior, as if
      searching it with fiery spears. He had slept ten hours. He rose
      tremblingly to his knees. Everything was quiet without; he might yet
      escape. He crawled to the opening. The open space before it was empty, but
      the scaffolding was gone. The clear, keen air revived him. As he sprang
      out, erect, a shout that nearly stunned him seemed to rise from the earth
      on all sides. He glanced around him in a helpless agony of fear. A dozen
      concentric circles of squatting Indians, whose heads were visible above
      the reeds, encompassed the banks around the sunken base of the sweat-house
      with successive dusky rings. Every avenue of escape seemed closed. Perhaps
      for that reason the attitude of his surrounding captors was passive rather
      than aggressive, and the shrewd, half-Hebraic profiles nearest him
      expressed only stoical waiting. There was a strange similarity of
      expression in his own immovable apathy of despair. His only sense of
      averting his fate was a confused idea of explaining his intrusion. His
      desperate memory yielded a few common Indian words. He pointed
      automatically to himself and the stream. His white lips moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I come&mdash;from&mdash;the river!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A guttural cry, as if the whole assembly were clearing their throats, went
      round the different circles. The nearest rocked themselves to and fro and
      bent their feathered heads toward him. A hollow-cheeked, decrepit old man
      arose and said, simply:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is he! The great chief has come!"
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      He was saved. More than that, he was re-created. For, by signs and
      intimations he was quickly made aware that since the death of their late
      chief, their medicine-men had prophesied that his perfect successor should
      appear miraculously before them, borne noiselessly on the river FROM THE
      SEA, in the plumes and insignia of his predecessor. This mere coincidence
      of appearance and costume might not have been convincing to the braves had
      not Elijah Martin's actual deficiencies contributed to their unquestioned
      faith in him. Not only his inert possession of the sweat-house and his
      apathetic attitude in their presence, but his utter and complete
      unlikeness to the white frontiersmen of their knowledge and tradition&mdash;creatures
      of fire and sword and malevolent activity&mdash;as well as his manifest
      dissimilarity to themselves, settled their conviction of his supernatural
      origin. His gentle, submissive voice, his yielding will, his lazy
      helplessness, the absence of strange weapons and fierce explosives in his
      possession, his unwonted sobriety&mdash;all proved him an exception to his
      apparent race that was in itself miraculous. For it must be confessed
      that, in spite of the cherished theories of most romances and all
      statesmen and commanders, that FEAR is the great civilizer of the savage
      barbarian, and that he is supposed to regard the prowess of the white man
      and his mysterious death-dealing weapons as evidence of his supernatural
      origin and superior creation, the facts have generally pointed to the
      reverse. Elijah Martin was not long in discovering that when the Minyo
      hunter, with his obsolete bow, dropped dead by a bullet from a viewless
      and apparently noiseless space, it was NOT considered the lightnings of an
      avenging Deity, but was traced directly to the ambushed rifle of Kansas
      Joe, swayed by a viciousness quite as human as their own; the spectacle of
      Blizzard Dick, verging on delirium tremens, and riding "amuck" into an
      Indian village with a revolver in each hand, did NOT impress them as a
      supernatural act, nor excite their respectful awe as much as the less
      harmful frenzy of one of their own medicine-men; they were NOT influenced
      by implacable white gods, who relaxed only to drive hard bargains and
      exchange mildewed flour and shoddy blankets for their fish and furs. I am
      afraid they regarded these raids of Christian civilization as they looked
      upon grasshopper plagues, famines, inundations, and epidemics; while an
      utterly impassive God washed his hands of the means he had employed, and
      even encouraged the faithful to resist and overcome his emissaries&mdash;the
      white devils! Had Elijah Martin been a student of theology, he would have
      been struck with the singular resemblance of these theories&mdash;although
      the application thereof was reversed&mdash;to the Christian faith. But
      Elijah Martin had neither the imagination of a theologian nor the insight
      of a politician. He only saw that he, hitherto ignored and despised in a
      community of half-barbaric men, now translated to a community of men
      wholly savage, was respected and worshipped!
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have turned a stronger head than Elijah's. He was at first
      frightened, fearful lest his reception concealed some hidden irony, or
      that, like the flower-crowned victim of ancient sacrifice, he was exalted
      and sustained to give importance and majesty to some impending martyrdom.
      Then he began to dread that his innocent deceit&mdash;if deceit it was&mdash;should
      be discovered; at last, partly from meekness and partly from the animal
      contentment of present security, he accepted the situation. Fortunately
      for him it was purely passive. The Great Chief of the Minyo tribe was
      simply an expressionless idol of flesh and blood. The previous incumbent
      of that office had been an old man, impotent and senseless of late years
      through age and disease. The chieftains and braves had consulted in
      council before him, and perfunctorily submitted their decisions, like
      offerings, to his unresponsive shrine. In the same way, all material
      events&mdash;expeditions, trophies, industries&mdash;were supposed to pass
      before the dull, impassive eyes of the great chief, for direct acceptance.
      On the second day of Elijah's accession, two of the braves brought a
      bleeding human scalp before him. Elijah turned pale, trembled, and averted
      his head, and then, remembering the danger of giving way to his weakness,
      grew still more ghastly. The warriors watched him with impassioned faces.
      A grunt&mdash;but whether of astonishment, dissent, or approval, he would
      not tell&mdash;went round the circle. But the scalp was taken away and
      never again appeared in his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      An incident still more alarming quickly followed. Two captives, white men,
      securely bound, were one day brought before him on their way to the stake,
      followed by a crowd of old and young squaws and children. The unhappy
      Elijah recognized in the prisoners two packers from a distant settlement
      who sometimes passed through Redwood Camp. An agony of terror, shame, and
      remorse shook the pseudo chief to his crest of high feathers, and blanched
      his face beneath its paint and yellow ochre. To interfere to save them
      from the torture they were evidently to receive at the hands of those
      squaws and children, according to custom, would be exposure and death to
      him as well as themselves; while to assist by his passive presence at the
      horrible sacrifice of his countrymen was too much for even his weak
      selfishness. Scarcely knowing what he did as the lugubrious procession
      passed before him, he hurriedly hid his face in his blanket and turned his
      back upon the scene. There was a dead silence. The warriors were evidently
      unprepared for this extraordinary conduct of their chief. What might have
      been their action it was impossible to conjecture, for at that moment a
      little squaw, perhaps impatient for the sport and partly emboldened by the
      fact that she had been selected, only a few days before, as the betrothed
      of the new chief, approached him slyly from the other side. The horrified
      eyes of Elijah, momentarily raised from his blanket, saw and recognized
      her. The feebleness of a weak nature, that dared not measure itself
      directly with the real cause, vented its rage on a secondary object. He
      darted a quick glance of indignation and hatred at the young girl. She ran
      back in startled terror to her companions, a hurried consultation
      followed, and in another moment the whole bevy of girls, old women, and
      children were on the wing, shrieking and crying, to their wigwams.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see," said one of the prisoners coolly to the other, in English, "I
      was right. They never intended to do anything to us. It was only a bluff.
      These Minyos are a different sort from the other tribes. They never kill
      anybody if they can help it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're wrong," said the other, excitedly. "It was that big chief there,
      with his head in a blanket, that sent those dogs to the right about. Hell!
      did you see them run at just a look from him? He's a high and mighty
      feller, you bet. Look at his dignity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so&mdash;he ain't no slouch," said the other, gazing at Elijah's
      muffled head, critically. "D&mdash;&mdash;d if he ain't a born king."
    </p>
    <p>
      The sudden conflict and utter revulsion of emotion that those simple words
      caused in Elijah's breast was almost incredible. He had been at first
      astounded by the revelation of the peaceful reputation of the unknown
      tribe he had been called upon to govern; but even this comforting
      assurance was as nothing compared to the greater revelations implied in
      the speaker's praise of himself. He, Elijah Martin! the despised, the
      rejected, the worthless outcast of Redwood Camp, recognized as a "born
      king," a leader; his power felt by the very men who had scorned him! And
      he had done nothing&mdash;stop! had he actually done NOTHING? Was it not
      possible that he was REALLY what they thought him? His brain reeled under
      the strong, unaccustomed wine of praise; acting upon his weak selfishness,
      it exalted him for a moment to their measure of his strength, even as
      their former belief in his inefficiency had kept him down. Courage is too
      often only the memory of past success. This was his first effort; he
      forgot he had not earned it, even as he now ignored the danger of earning
      it. The few words of unconscious praise had fallen like the blade of
      knighthood on his cowering shoulders; he had risen ennobled from the
      contact. Though his face was still muffled in his blanket, he stood erect
      and seemed to have gained in stature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The braves had remained standing irresolute, and yet watchful, a few paces
      from their captives. Suddenly, Elijah, still keeping his back to the
      prisoners, turned upon the braves, with blazing eyes, violently throwing
      out his hands with the gesture of breaking bonds. Like all sudden
      demonstrations of undemonstrative men, it was extravagant, weird, and
      theatrical. But it was more potent than speech&mdash;the speech that, even
      if effective, would still have betrayed him to his countrymen. The braves
      hurriedly cut the thongs of the prisoners; another impulsive gesture from
      Elijah, and they, too, fled. When he lifted his eyes cautiously from his
      blanket, captors and captives had dispersed in opposite directions, and he
      was alone&mdash;and triumphant!
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment Elijah Martin was another man. He went to bed that night
      in an intoxicating dream of power; he arose a man of will, of strength. He
      read it in the eyes of the braves, albeit at times averted in wonder. He
      understood, now, that although peace had been their habit and custom, they
      had nevertheless sought to test his theories of administration with the
      offering of the scalps and the captives, and in this detection of their
      common weakness he forgot his own. Most heroes require the contrast of the
      unheroic to set them off; and Elijah actually found himself devising means
      for strengthening the defensive and offensive character of the tribe, and
      was himself strengthened by it. Meanwhile the escaped packers did not fail
      to heighten the importance of their adventure by elevating the character
      and achievements of their deliverer; and it was presently announced
      throughout the frontier settlements that the hitherto insignificant and
      peaceful tribe of Minyos, who inhabited a large territory bordering on the
      Pacific Ocean, had developed into a powerful nation, only kept from the
      war-path by a more powerful but mysterious chief. The Government sent an
      Indian agent to treat with them, in its usual half-paternal,
      half-aggressive, and wholly inconsistent policy. Elijah, who still
      retained the imitative sense and adaptability to surroundings which belong
      to most lazy, impressible natures, and in striped yellow and vermilion
      features looked the chief he personated, met the agent with silent and
      becoming gravity. The council was carried on by signs. Never before had an
      Indian treaty been entered into with such perfect knowledge of the
      intentions and designs of the whites by the Indians, and such profound
      ignorance of the qualities of the Indians by the whites. It need scarcely
      be said that the treaty was an unquestionable Indian success. They did not
      give up their arable lands; what they did sell to the agent they refused
      to exchange for extravagant-priced shoddy blankets, worthless guns, damp
      powder, and mouldy meal. They took pay in dollars, and were thus enabled
      to open more profitable commerce with the traders at the settlements for
      better goods and better bargains; they simply declined beads, whiskey, and
      Bibles at any price. The result was that the traders found it profitable
      to protect them from their countrymen, and the chances of wantonly
      shooting down a possible valuable customer stopped the old indiscriminate
      rifle-practice. The Indians were allowed to cultivate their fields in
      peace. Elijah purchased for them a few agricultural implements. The
      catching, curing, and smoking of salmon became an important branch of
      trade. They waxed prosperous and rich; they lost their nomadic habits&mdash;a
      centralized settlement bearing the external signs of an Indian village
      took the place of their old temporary encampments, but the huts were
      internally an improvement on the old wigwams. The dried fish were banished
      from the tent-poles to long sheds especially constructed for that purpose.
      The sweat-house was no longer utilized for worldly purposes. The wise and
      mighty Elijah did not attempt to reform their religion, but to preserve it
      in its integrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      That these improvements and changes were due to the influence of one man
      was undoubtedly true, but that he was necessarily a superior man did not
      follow. Elijah's success was due partly to the fact that he had been
      enabled to impress certain negative virtues, which were part of his own
      nature, upon a community equally constituted to receive them. Each was
      strengthened by the recognition in each other of the unexpected value of
      those qualities; each acquired a confidence begotten of their success.
      "He-hides-his-face," as Elijah Martin was known to the tribe after the
      episode of the released captives, was really not so much of an autocrat as
      many constitutional rulers.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Two years of tranquil prosperity passed. Elijah Martin, foundling,
      outcast, without civilized ties or relationship of any kind, forgotten by
      his countrymen, and lifted into alien power, wealth, security, and
      respect, became&mdash;homesick!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was near the close of a summer afternoon. He was sitting at the door of
      his lodge, which overlooked, on one side, the far-shining levels of the
      Pacific and, on the other, the slow descent to the cultivated meadows and
      banks of the Minyo River, that debouched through a waste of salt-marsh,
      beach-grass, sand-dunes, and foamy estuary into the ocean. The headland,
      or promontory&mdash;the only eminence of the Minyo territory&mdash;had
      been reserved by him for his lodge, partly on account of its isolation
      from the village at its base, and partly for the view it commanded of his
      territory. Yet his wearying and discontented eyes were more often found on
      the ocean, as a possible highway of escape from his irksome position, than
      on the plain and the distant range of mountains, so closely connected with
      the nearer past and his former detractors. In his vague longing he had no
      desire to return to them, even in triumph in his present security there
      still lingered a doubt of his ability to cope with the old conditions. It
      was more like his easy, indolent nature&mdash;which revived in his
      prosperity&mdash;to trust to this least practical and remote solution of
      his trouble. His homesickness was as vague as his plan for escape from it;
      he did not know exactly what he regretted, but it was probably some life
      he had not enjoyed, some pleasure that had escaped his former incompetency
      and poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had sat thus a hundred times, as aimlessly blinking at the vast
      possibilities of the shining sea beyond, turning his back upon the nearer
      and more practicable mountains, lulled by the far-off beating of
      monotonous rollers, the lonely cry of the curlew and plover, the drowsy
      changes of alternate breaths of cool, fragrant reeds and warm, spicy sands
      that blew across his eyelids, and succumbed to sleep, as he had done a
      hundred times before. The narrow strips of colored cloth, insignia of his
      dignity, flapped lazily from his tent-poles, and at last seemed to slumber
      with him; the shadows of the leaf-tracery thrown by the bay-tree, on the
      ground at his feet, scarcely changed its pattern. Nothing moved but the
      round, restless, berry-like eyes of Wachita, his child-wife, the former
      heroine of the incident with the captive packers, who sat near her lord,
      armed with a willow wand, watchful of intruding wasps, sand-flies, and
      even the more ostentatious advances of a rotund and clerical-looking
      humble-bee, with his monotonous homily. Content, dumb, submissive, vacant,
      at such times, Wachita, debarred her husband's confidences through the
      native customs and his own indifferent taciturnity, satisfied herself by
      gazing at him with the wondering but ineffectual sympathy of a faithful
      dog. Unfortunately for Elijah her purely mechanical ministration could not
      prevent a more dangerous intrusion upon his security.
    </p>
    <p>
      He awoke with a light start, and eyes that gradually fixed upon the woman
      a look of returning consciousness. Wachita pointed timidly to the village
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Messenger of the Great White Father has come to-day, with his wagons
      and horses; he would see the chief of the Minyos, but I would not disturb
      my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elijah's brow contracted. Relieved of its characteristic metaphor, he knew
      that this meant that the new Indian agent had made his usual official
      visit, and had exhibited the usual anxiety to see the famous chieftain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good!" he said. "White Rabbit [his lieutenant] will see the Messenger and
      exchange gifts. It is enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The white messenger has brought his wangee [white] woman with him. They
      would look upon the face of him who hides it," continued Wachita,
      dubiously. "They would that Wachita should bring them nearer to where my
      lord is, that they might see him when he knew it not."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elijah glanced moodily at his wife, with the half suspicion with which he
      still regarded her alien character. "Then let Wachita go back to the
      squaws and old women, and let her hide herself with them until the wangee
      strangers are gone," he said curtly. "I have spoken. Go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Accustomed to these abrupt dismissals, which did not necessarily indicate
      displeasure, Wachita disappeared without a word. Elijah, who had risen,
      remained for a few moments leaning against the tent-poles, gazing
      abstractedly toward the sea. The bees droned uninterruptedly in his ears,
      the far-off roll of the breakers came to him distinctly; but suddenly,
      with greater distinctness, came the murmur of a woman's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He don't look savage a bit! Why, he's real handsome."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! you&mdash;" said a second voice, in a frightened whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if he DID hear he couldn't understand," returned the first voice. A
      suppressed giggle followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily, Elijah's natural and acquired habits of repression suited the
      emergency. He did not move, although he felt the quick blood fly to his
      face, and the voice of the first speaker had suffused him with a strange
      and delicious anticipation. He restrained himself, though the words she
      had naively dropped were filling him with new and tremulous suggestion. He
      was motionless, even while he felt that the vague longing and yearning
      which had possessed him hitherto was now mysteriously taking some unknown
      form and action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The murmuring ceased. The humble-bees' drone again became ascendant&mdash;a
      sudden fear seized him. She was GOING; he should never see her! While he
      had stood there a dolt and sluggard, she had satisfied her curiosity and
      stolen away. With a sudden yielding to impulse, he darted quickly in the
      direction where he had heard her voice. The thicket moved, parted,
      crackled, and rustled, and then undulated thirty feet before him in a long
      wave, as if from the passage of some lithe, invisible figure. But at the
      same moment a little cry, half of alarm, half of laughter, broke from his
      very feet, and a bent manzanito-bush, relaxed by frightened fingers, flew
      back against his breast. Thrusting it hurriedly aside, his stooping, eager
      face came almost in contact with the pink, flushed cheeks and tangled
      curls of a woman's head. He was so near, her moist and laughing eyes
      almost drowned his eager glance; her parted lips and white teeth were so
      close to his that her quick breath took away his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had dropped on one knee, as her companion fled, expecting he would
      overlook her as he passed, but his direct onset had extracted the feminine
      outcry. Yet even then she did not seem greatly frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's only a joke, sir," she said, coolly lifting herself to her feet by
      grasping his arm. "I'm Mrs. Dall, the Indian agent's wife. They said you
      wouldn't let anybody see you&mdash;and I determined I would. That's all!"
      She stopped, threw back her tangled curls behind her ears, shook the
      briers and thorns from her skirt, and added: "Well, I reckon you aren't
      afraid of a woman, are you? So no harm's done. Good-by!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew slightly back as if to retreat, but the elasticity of the
      manzanito against which she was leaning threw her forward once more. He
      again inhaled the perfume of her hair; he saw even the tiny freckles that
      darkened her upper lip and brought out the moist, red curve below. A
      sudden recollection of a playmate of his vagabond childhood flashed across
      his mind; a wild inspiration of lawlessness, begotten of his past
      experience, his solitude, his dictatorial power, and the beauty of the
      woman before him, mounted to his brain. He threw his arms passionately
      around her, pressed his lips to hers, and with a half-hysterical laugh
      drew back and disappeared in the thicket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dall remained for an instant dazed and stupefied. Then she lifted her
      arm mechanically, and with her sleeve wiped her bruised mouth and the
      ochre-stain that his paint had left, like blood, upon her cheek. Her
      laughing face had become instantly grave, but not from fear; her dark eyes
      had clouded, but not entirely with indignation. She suddenly brought down
      her hand sharply against her side with a gesture of discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's no Injun!" she said, with prompt decision. The next minute she
      plunged back into the trail again, and the dense foliage once more closed
      around her. But as she did so the broad, vacant face and the mutely
      wondering eyes of Wachita rose, like a placid moon, between the branches
      of a tree where they had been hidden, and shone serenely and impassively
      after her.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      A month elapsed. But it was a month filled with more experience to Elijah
      than his past two years of exaltation. In the first few days following his
      meeting with Mrs. Dall, he was possessed by terror, mingled with flashes
      of desperation, at the remembrance of his rash imprudence. His
      recollection of extravagant frontier chivalry to womankind, and the swift
      retribution of the insulted husband or guardian, alternately filled him
      with abject fear or extravagant recklessness. At times prepared for
      flight, even to the desperate abandonment of himself in a canoe to the
      waters of the Pacific: at times he was on the point of inciting his braves
      to attack the Indian agency and precipitate the war that he felt would be
      inevitable. As the days passed, and there seemed to be no interruption to
      his friendly relations with the agency, with that relief a new, subtle joy
      crept into Elijah's heart. The image of the agent's wife framed in the
      leafy screen behind his lodge, the perfume of her hair and breath mingled
      with the spicing of the bay, the brief thrill and tantalization of the
      stolen kiss still haunted him. Through his long, shy abstention from
      society, and his two years of solitary exile, the fresh beauty of this
      young Western wife, in whom the frank artlessness of girlhood still
      lingered, appeared to him like a superior creation. He forgot his vague
      longings in the inception of a more tangible but equally unpractical
      passion. He remembered her unconscious and spontaneous admiration of him;
      he dared to connect it with her forgiving silence. If she had withheld her
      confidences from her husband, he could hope&mdash;he knew not exactly
      what!
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon Wachita put into his hand a folded note. With an instinctive
      presentiment of its contents, Elijah turned red and embarrassed in
      receiving it from the woman who was recognized as his wife. But the
      impassive, submissive manner of this household drudge, instead of touching
      his conscience, seemed to him a vulgar and brutal acceptance of the
      situation that dulled whatever compunction he might have had. He opened
      the note and read hurriedly as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You took a great freedom with me the other day, and I am justified in
      taking one with you now. I believe you understand English as well as I do.
      If you want to explain that and your conduct to me, I will be at the same
      place this afternoon. My friend will accompany me, but she need not hear
      what you have to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elijah read the letter, which might have been written by an ordinary
      school-girl, as if it had conveyed the veiled rendezvous of a princess.
      The reserve, caution, and shyness which had been the safeguard of his weak
      nature were swamped in a flow of immature passion. He flew to the
      interview with the eagerness and inexperience of first love. He was
      completely at her mercy. So utterly was he subjugated by her presence that
      she did not even run the risk of his passion. Whatever sentiment might
      have mingled with her curiosity, she was never conscious of a necessity to
      guard herself against it. At this second meeting she was in full
      possession of his secret. He had told her everything; she had promised
      nothing in return&mdash;she had not even accepted anything. Even her
      actual after-relations to the denouement of his passion are still shrouded
      in mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Elijah lived two weeks on the unsubstantial memory of this
      meeting. What might have followed could not be known, for at the end of
      that time an outrage&mdash;so atrocious that even the peaceful Minyos were
      thrilled with savage indignation&mdash;was committed on the outskirts of
      the village. An old chief, who had been specially selected to deal with
      the Indian agent, and who kept a small trading outpost, had been killed
      and his goods despoiled by a reckless Redwood packer. The murderer had
      coolly said that he was only "serving out" the tool of a fraudulent
      imposture on the Government, and that he dared the arch-impostor himself,
      the so-called Minyo chief, to help himself. A wave of ungovernable fury
      surged up to the very tent-poles of Elijah's lodge and demanded vengeance.
      Elijah trembled and hesitated. In the thraldom of his selfish passion for
      Mrs. Dall he dared not contemplate a collision with her countrymen. He
      would have again sought refuge in his passive, non-committal attitude, but
      he knew the impersonal character of Indian retribution and compensation&mdash;a
      sacrifice of equal value, without reference to the culpability of the
      victim&mdash;and he dreaded some spontaneous outbreak. To prevent the
      enforced expiation of the crime by some innocent brother packer, he was
      obliged to give orders for the pursuit and arrest of the criminal,
      secretly hoping for his escape or the interposition of some circumstance
      to avert his punishment. A day of sullen expectancy to the old men and
      squaws in camp, of gloomy anxiety to Elijah alone in his lodge, followed
      the departure of the braves on the war-path. It was midnight when they
      returned. Elijah, who from his habitual reserve and the accepted etiquette
      of his exalted station had remained impassive in his tent, only knew from
      the guttural rejoicings of the squaws that the expedition had been
      successful and the captive was in their hands. At any other time he might
      have thought it an evidence of some growing scepticism of his
      infallibility of judgment and a diminution of respect that they did not
      confront him with their prisoner. But he was too glad to escape from the
      danger of exposure and possible arraignment of his past life by the
      desperate captive, even though it might not have been understood by the
      spectators. He reflected that the omission might have arisen from their
      recollection of his previous aversion to a retaliation on other prisoners.
      Enough that they would wait his signal for the torture and execution at
      sunrise the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night passed slowly. It is more than probable that the selfish and
      ignoble torments of the sleepless and vacillating judge were greater than
      those of the prisoner who dozed at the stake between his curses. Yet it
      was part of Elijah's fatal weakness that his kinder and more human
      instincts were dominated even at that moment by his lawless passion for
      the Indian agent's wife, and his indecision as to the fate of his captive
      was as much due to this preoccupation as to a selfish consideration of her
      relations to the result. He hated the prisoner for his infelicitous and
      untimely crime, yet he could not make up his mind to his death. He paced
      the ground before his lodge in dishonorable incertitude. The small eyes of
      the submissive Wachita watched him with vague solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward morning he was struck by a shameful inspiration. He would creep
      unperceived to the victim's side, unloose his bonds, and bid him fly to
      the Indian agency. There he was to inform Mrs. Dall that her husband's
      safety depended upon his absenting himself for a few days, but that she
      was to remain and communicate with Elijah. She would understand
      everything, perhaps; at least she would know that the prisoner's release
      was to please her, but even if she did not, no harm would be done, a white
      man's life would be saved, and his real motive would not be suspected. He
      turned with feverish eagerness to the lodge. Wachita had disappeared&mdash;probably
      to join the other women. It was well; she would not suspect him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tree to which the doomed man was bound was, by custom, selected
      nearest the chief's lodge, within its sacred enclosure, with no other
      protection than that offered by its reserved seclusion and the outer
      semicircle of warriors' tents before it. To escape, the captive would
      therefore have to pass beside the chief's lodge to the rear and descend
      the hill toward the shore. Elijah would show him the way, and make it
      appear as if he had escaped unaided. As he glided into the shadow of a
      group of pines, he could dimly discern the outline of the destined victim,
      secured against one of the larger trees in a sitting posture, with his
      head fallen forward on his breast as if in sleep. But at the same moment
      another figure glided out from the shadow and approached the fatal tree.
      It was Wachita!
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped in amazement. But in another instant a flash of intelligence
      made it clear. He remembered her vague uneasiness and solicitude at his
      agitation, her sudden disappearance; she had fathomed his perplexity, as
      she had once before. Of her own accord she was going to release the
      prisoner! The knife to cut his cords glittered in her hand. Brave and
      faithful animal!
    </p>
    <p>
      He held his breath as he drew nearer. But, to his horror, the knife
      suddenly flashed in the air and darted down, again and again, upon the
      body of the helpless man. There was a convulsive struggle, but no outcry,
      and the next moment the body hung limp and inert in its cords. Elijah
      would himself have fallen, half-fainting, against a tree, but, by a
      revulsion of feeling, came the quick revelation that the desperate girl
      had rightly solved the problem! She had done what he ought to have done&mdash;and
      his loyalty and manhood were preserved. That conviction and the courage to
      act upon it&mdash;to have called the sleeping braves to witness his
      sacrifice&mdash;would have saved him, but it was ordered otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the girl rapidly passed him he threw out his hand and seized her wrist.
      "Who did you do this for?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For you," she said, stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you no kill him&mdash;you love his squaw."
    </p>
    <p>
      "HIS squaw!" He staggered back. A terrible suspicion flashed upon him. He
      dashed Wachita aside and ran to the tree. It was the body of the Indian
      agent! Aboriginal justice had been satisfied. The warriors had not caught
      the MURDERER, but, true to their idea of vicarious retribution, had
      determined upon the expiatory sacrifice of a life as valuable and innocent
      as the one they had lost.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      "So the Gov'rment hev at last woke up and wiped out them cussed Digger
      Minyos," said Snapshot Harry, as he laid down the newspaper, in the
      brand-new saloon of the brand-new town of Redwood. "I see they've
      stampeded both banks of the Minyo River, and sent off a lot to the
      reservation. I reckon the soldiers at Fort Cass got sick o' sentiment
      after those hounds killed the Injun agent, and are beginning to agree with
      us that the only 'good Injun' is a dead one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it turns out that that wonderful chief, that them two packers used to
      rave about, woz about as big a devil ez any, and tried to run off with the
      agent's wife, only the warriors killed her. I'd like to know what become
      of him. Some says he was killed, others allow that he got away. I've heerd
      tell that he was originally some kind of Methodist preacher!&mdash;a kind
      o' saint that got a sort o' spiritooal holt on the old squaws and
      children."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why don't you ask old Skeesicks? I see he's back here ag'in&mdash;and
      grubbin' along at a dollar a day on tailin's. He's been somewhere up
      north, they say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, Skeesicks? that shiftless, o'n'ry cuss! You bet he wusn't anywhere
      where there was danger of fighting. Why, you might as well hev suspected
      HIM of being the big chief himself! There he comes&mdash;ask him."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the laughter was so general that Elijah Martin&mdash;alias Skeesicks&mdash;lounging
      shyly into the bar-room, joined in it weakly.
    </p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
