SHE WALKS IN BEAUTY.

"She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes:
Thus mellow'd to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies."
(Hebrew  Melodies.)
      


      

      

A DAY WITH BYRON.
      

ne February afternoon in the
year 1822, about two o'clock,       for
this is the hour at which his
day begins,       "the most notorious
personality of his century"
arouses himself, in the Palazzo
Lanfranchi at Pisa. George
Gordon Noel, Lord Byron, languidly arises
and dresses, with the assistance of his devoted
valet Fletcher. Invariably he awakes in very
low spirits, "in actual despair and despondency,"
he has termed it: this is in part constitutional,
and partly, no doubt, a reaction after the
feverish brain-work of the previous night. It
is, at any rate, in unutterable melancholy and
ennui that he surveys in the mirror that slight
and graceful form, which had been idolised by
London drawing-rooms, and that pale, scornful,
beautiful face, "like a spirit, good or evil,"
which the enthusiastic Walter Scott has termed
a thing to dream of. He notes the grey streaks
already visible among his dark brown locks, and
mutters his own lines miserably to himself,       



Through life's dull road, so dim and dirty,
I have dragg'd to three-and-thirty.
What have these years left to me?
Nothing       except thirty-three.



An innumerable motley crowd of reminiscences       most
of them bitter, sorrowful, or contemptuous,
throng across his mind, shaping themselves
into poignant verse:



There's not a joy the world can give like that it takes away,
When the glow of early thought declines in feeling's dull decay;
'Tis not on youth's smooth cheek the blush alone, which fades so fast,
But the tender bloom of heart is gone, ere youth itself be past.
.....
Oh! could I feel as I have felt,       or be what I have been,
Or weep as I could once have wept o'er many a vanished scene;
As springs in desert found seem sweet, all brackish though they be,
So, 'midst the wither'd waste of life, those tears would flow to me.



A meagre breakfast,       of claret and soda with a
few mouthfuls of some Italian dish,       somewhat
restores his natural vivacity: and he listens
with cynical amusement to Fletcher's blood-curdling
stories of the phantoms who have made
night hideous. For the famous old feudal
Palazzo, with its dungeons and secret chambers,
has been immemorially  infested with ghosts,
and harassed by inexplicable noises. Fletcher
has already begged leave to change his room,
and then refused to occupy his new room,
because, as his master reports, "there are more
ghosts there than in the other!         There
is one place where people were evidently
walled up.         I am bothered about these
spectres, as they say the last occupants were
too." However, he is laughing as he descends
the magnificent staircase,       the reputed work
of Michael Angelo,       laughing until the shrill
querulous cries of peevish children make him
stop and frown. He has allowed the Leigh
Hunts, with their large and fractious family, to
occupy for the present the ground-floor of the
Palazzo; and children are his pet abhorrence.
"I abominate the sight of them so much," he
has already told Moore, "that I have always
had the greatest respect for the character of
Herod!" No child figures in any of his poems:
his own paternal feeling towards "Ada, sole
daughter of my house and home," is merely a
fluctuating sentiment.

He shrugs his shoulders and enters his great
salon, again moody and with a downcast air:
and throws himself upon a couch in gloomy
reverie. Snatches of poetry wander through
his thoughts       poetry intrinsically autobiographical,
for "the inequalities of his style are
those of his career," and his imaginary heroes
are endless reproductions of himself, "the
wandering outlaw of his own dark mind." He
has drawn his own picture more effectively in
Lara than any strange hand could do.



In him, inexplicably mix'd, appear'd
Much to be loved and hated, sought and fear'd;
Opinion, varying o'er his hidden lot,
In praise or railing ne'er his name forgot        .
      
There was in him a vital scorn of all:
As if the worst had fall'n which could befall;
He stood a stranger in this breathing world,
An erring spirit from another hurl'd        .
      
His early dreams of good outstripp'd the truth,
And troubled manhood follow'd baffled youth.


His men, in short, as has been observed, are
"made after his own image, and his women
after his own heart." Yet the inveterate family
likeness of these heroes is not shared by the
heroines of his romantic stanzas: for Byron
has an eclectic taste in beauty. One can hardly
imagine a wider dissimilarity than between the
Bride of Abydos, the gentle Zuleika, with her




"Nameless charms unmark'd by her alone       
      
The light of love, the purity of grace,
The mind, the music breathing from her face,
The heart whose softness harmonised the whole,
And oh! that eye was in itself a Soul."


and "Circassia's daughter," the stately Leila of
The Giaour, whose black and flowing hair "swept
the marble where her feet gleamed whiter
than the mountain sleet." Or, if the reader seek
a further choice, there is Medora, beloved of
the Corsair,       Medora of the deep blue eye and
long fair hair; or the nameless Eastern maiden
of the Hebrew Melodies:



She walks in beauty, like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in her aspect and her eyes:
Thus mellow'd to that tender light
Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
      
One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impair'd the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.
      
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent,
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!



Yet all these heroines are alike in one respect       their
potentiality of passionate emotion:
since Byron's "passions and his powers,"
according to his intense admirer Shelley, "are
incomparably greater than those of other men:"
and he has used the last almost recklessly in
portrayal of the first.
      
As the poet reclines in sombre meditation,
his reverie is broken by the not unwelcome
entrance of his friends       who may be better
termed his intimate acquaintances. For, to that
brooding, introspective spirit,       constitutionally
shy, and morbidly conscious of the fact,       "friendship
is a propensity," he has declared,
"to which my genius is very limited. I do not
know the male human being, except Lord Clare,
the friend of my infancy, for whom I feel anything
that deserves the name. All my others
are men-of-the-world friendships." Be that as
it may, it is with a warmly cordial expression,
and with that peculiarly sweet smile of his, that
Byron welcomes his usual visitors,       Captain
Williams, Captain Medwin, Taafe the Irishman,
and Percy Bysshe Shelley, "the most companionable
person under thirty," he has avowed,
"that ever I knew." When they have discussed
the latest little Pisan on dits, and the progress
of Shelley's boat-building, the conversation
trends more and more towards literary topics:
personal topics, be it understood, for Byron
is not an omnivorous reader like Shelley.
Williams and Medwin, themselves dabblers in
verse and prose, listen with respectful admiration
to the dicta of the great poets exchanging
views. The low, clear, harmonious voice of
Byron "is a sort of intoxication: men are held
by it as under a spell." He makes no secret of
his open contempt for the professional writing
fraternity. "Who would write, if he had anything
better to do?" he scornfully enquires, "I
think the mighty stir made about scribbling and
scribes, by themselves  and  others, a sign of
effeminacy, degeneracy, and weakness."
      
Shelley, whose assiduous studies in literature
have led him to quite other conclusions,
defends his craft with ardour. But Byron's
chief successes have been too lightly won. He
who wrote the Corsair in ten days, the Bride of
Abydos in four, and Lara whilst undressing after
balls and masquerades, cannot be expected to
take a very serious view of poetry as the one
business of a lifetime. "I by no means rank
poetry or poets," says he, "high in the scale
of imagination. Poetry is the lava of the imagination,
whose eruption prevents an earthquake.
If I live ten years longer," he adds
prophetically, "you will see that all is not
over with me,       I don't mean in literature,
for that is nothing, and, it may seem odd
enough to say, I don't think it's my vocation.
But you will see that I shall do something or
other!"

JUAN AND HAID        E.
"They heard the waves splash, and the wind so low,
And saw each other's dark eyes darting light
Into each other       and, beholding this,
Their lips drew near, and clung into a kiss."
(Don Juan.)


      

      
This contemner of poesy, however, is soon
persuaded, without much difficulty, to read
aloud some excerpts from his new poems in
process of completion: and very well he reads
them. The listeners are moved to smiles by
the bitter humour of the Vision of Judgment:
they are left half breathless by the impetuous
vigour of Heaven and Earth. But a murmur of
unfeigned applause punctuates the second canto
of Don Juan, with its exquisite presentment of
youth, love, and ecstasy in the persons of Juan
and Haid        e.



It was the cooling hour, just when the rounded
Red sun sinks down behind the azure hill,
Which then seems as if the whole earth it bounded,
Circling all nature, hush'd, and dim, and still,
With the far mountain-crescent half surrounded
On one side, and the deep sea calm and chill,
Upon the other, and the rosy sky,
With one star sparkling through it like an eye.
And thus they wander'd forth, and hand in hand,
Over the shining pebbles and the shells,
Glided along the smooth and harden'd sand        .
....
They look'd up to the sky, whose floating glow
Spread like a rosy ocean, vast and bright;
They gazed upon the glittering sea below,
Whence the broad moon rose circling into sight;
They heard the waves splash, and the wind so low,
And saw each other's dark eyes darting light
Into each other       and, beholding this,
Their lips drew near, and clung into a kiss.
(Don Juan.)



Byron's restless spirit, perpetually eager
to express itself in action, now makes him
anxious to dismiss intellectual discussions: and
he hastily proposes a game of billiards. As he
moves around the billiard-table, his lameness is
distinctly noticeable: not all the ingenuity of
his tailor, nor his own efforts to walk naturally,
can conceal it. Yet, as has been said of him in
other matters, he redeems all his defects by his
graces. And his companions note with surprise
the remarkable change for the better which has
taken place in him since, a few months before,
he arrived at this old palace on the Arno with
a troop of servants, carriages, horses, fowls,
dogs, and monkeys. The selfish and sensual
Byron of Venetian days is entirely a thing of
the past. "He is improved in every respect,"       says
Shelley to Williams, "in genius, in temper,
in moral views, in health and happiness." And
although keeping up a certain splendour upon
an income of        4000 a year, he devotes        1000 of
that income entirely to purposes of charity.
His own personal needs are of the simplest.

The game concluded, Byron's carriage is
announced: his friends and he proceed in it as
far as the town gates of Pisa, by this means to
avoid the starers of the streets. Horses are
in readiness at the gates: the company,
with one or two servant-men, mount and ride
into the pine-forest that reaches towards the
sea.
      
Byron is as excellent and graceful a rider
as a swimmer, with remarkable powers of endurance.
He can cover seventy or eighty miles
a day, fast going, and swim five miles at a stretch:
he is indeed, in many respects, the typical open-air
Englishman. But to-day he rides slowly
and immersed in thought. As his wife years
since assured him, he is at heart the most
melancholy of mankind, often when apparently
the gayest. His abnormally long sight takes in
every detail of the scenery,       storing it up unconsciously
for future reference. It has been
said that Byron is nothing without his descriptions:
and in these he has achieved some of his
finest work: notably in some immortal stanzas
of Childe Harold, with their dazzling panoramic
succession of vivid scenes: whether depicting
how



I stood in Venice, on the Bridge of Sighs;
A palace and a prison on each hand:
I saw from out the wave her structures rise
As from the stroke of the enchanter's wand.



or, on the eve of Waterloo,



There was a sound of revelry by night,
And Belgium's capital had gather'd then
Her Beauty and her Chivalry, and bright
The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men;
A thousand hearts beat happily; and when
Music arose with its voluptuous swell,
Soft eyes look'd love to eyes which spake again,
And all went merry as a marriage bell;
But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!



whether again, in the "vale of vintage,"



The castled crag of Drachenfels
Frowns o'er the wide and winding Rhine,
Whose breast of waters broadly swells
Between the banks which bear the vine,
And hills all rich with blossom'd trees,
....
And peasant girls, with deep blue eyes,
And hands which offer early flowers,
Walk smiling o'er this paradise.



or, looking backwards through a score of centuries,



I see before me the Gladiator lie:
He leans upon his hand       his manly brow
Consents to death, but conquers agony,
And his droop'd head sinks gradually low       
And through his side the last drops, ebbing slow
From the red gash, fall heavy, one by one,
Like the first of a thunder-shower; and now
The arena swims around him       he is gone,
Ere ceased the inhuman shout which hail'd the wretch who won.

THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD
"Thro' the crevice where it came,
That bird was perch'd, as fond and tame,
And tamer than upon the tree;
A lovely bird, with azure wings,
And song that said a thousand things,
And seem'd to say them all for me!"
(The Prisoner of Chillon.)


      

      

Byron is emphatically a citizen of the world,
who has "not only painted the environs, but
reflected the passions and aspirations of every
scene which he visualizes." And it is this
magic power of conveying the authentic impression
of an actual occurrence, which renders
his most recondite situations so thrilling,       which
breathes a Western vigour into the scented air
of the Orient, and thrills with poignant pathos
through the horrors of the Prisoner of Chillon.
      


A light broke in upon my brain       
It was the carol of a bird;
It ceased, and then it came again,
The sweetest song ear ever heard:
And mine was thankful till my eyes
Ran over with the glad surprise,
And they that moment could not see
I was the mate of misery;
But then by dull degrees came back
My senses to their wonted track;
I saw the dungeon walls and floor
Close slowly round me as before,
I saw the glimmer of the sun
Creeping as it before had done;
But through the crevice where it came
That bird was perch'd, as fond and tame,
And tamer than upon the tree;
A lovely bird, with azure wings,
And song that said a thousand things,
And seem'd to say them all for me!
I never saw its like before,
I ne'er shall see its likeness more:
It seem'd like me to want a mate,
But was not half so desolate,
And it was come to love me when
None lived to love me so again,
And cheering from my dungeon's brink,
Had brought me back to feel and think.
I know not if it late were free,
Or broke its cage to perch on mine,
But knowing well captivity,
Sweet bird! I could not wish for thine!
Or if it were, in winged guise,
A visitant from Paradise;
For       Heaven forgive that thought! the while
Which made me both to weep and smile       
I sometimes deem'd that it might be
My brother's soul come down to me;
But then at last away it flew,
And then 'twas mortal well I knew,
For he would never thus have flown,
And left me twice so doubly lone,
Lone as the corse within its shroud,
Lone as a solitary cloud,       
A single cloud on a sunny day,
While all the rest of heaven is clear,
A frown upon the atmosphere,
That hath no business to appear
When skies are blue, and earth is gay.
(The Prisoner of Chillon.)


      

Unhappily, all these shifting scenes of imagination
or experience       so the poet has made
mournful confession       have little power to wean
him from himself. "Neither the music of the
shepherd, the crashing of the avalanche, nor
the torrent, the mountain, the glacier, the forest,
nor the cloud, have for one moment lightened
the weight upon my heart, nor enabled me to
lose my own wretched identity in the majesty,
and the power, and the glory, above, around,
and beneath me."
      
And although, it will be noticed, he exempts
the sea       and although the blood of old sea-kings,
running fiercely in his veins, still kindles him to
imperishable rapture in its presence,       



And I have loved thee, Ocean! and my joy
Of youthful sports was on thy breast to be
Borne, like thy bubbles, onward: from a boy
I wanton'd with thy breakers       they to me
Were a delight; and if the freshening sea
Made them a terror       'twas a pleasing fear,
For I was as it were a child of thee,
And trusted to thy billows far and near,
And laid my hand upon thy mane       as I do here.
(Childe Harold.)



       yet there is sorrow on the sea itself,       the
"unplumb'd, salt, estranging sea" which separates
him from his mother-country. Cosmopolitan
as he is, self-banished exile, quick with
Greek and Italian sympathies, Byron never for
one moment forgets that he is head of one of
England's proudest families. Despite his
scathing scorn towards his fair-weather London
friends, towards the unreasoning outbursts of
malignity which drove him out of his England       with
all her faults, he loves her still. He
vaguely hopes and hankers after a return to
those long-lost shores: and endeavours to believe
that the future will in some way make atonement
for all the calamities of the past.
      
But now Shelley, Williams, Medwin, and
Taafe are dismounting in the pine forest, and
the men-servants setting up the target. Pistol-practice
is Byron's forte; when he hits a half-crown
at twelve yards he is as delighted as a
boy, and quite glum and disconcerted if he
should happen to miss. This very rarely
happens, as he is a crack shot, easily distancing
the other competitors. His hand trembles
violently, but he calculates on this vibration,
and, depending entirely on his eye, hardly ever
fails. After about an hour's shooting, the light
begins to wane towards sunset: and the friends
ride back to the city, Byron in exuberant
good humour with himself and everybody else.
Arrived at the Palazzo Lanfranchi, he finds
two guests awaiting him,       Count Pietro Gamba,
brother of the lovely Contessa Guiccioli, and
Trelawny, that handsome, picturesque, piratical-looking
"Younger Son," who has not yet
published to an astonished world his remarkable
and almost incredible "Adventures."
Trelawny is at present in command of Byron's
yacht the Bolivar, lying in the harbour of
Genoa.

      
The poet welcomes these new additions to
his company: for, since his arrival in Pisa, he
has begun to entertain men at dinner-parties,
for the first time since leaving England. A
very cheerful company sits down with him to
dinner: their host displays himself to great
advantage, "being at once," to quote Shelley,
"polite and cordial, full of social hilarity and
the most perfect good humour, never diverging
into ungraceful merriment, and yet keeping up
the spirit of liveliness throughout the evening."
Byron, according to his own declaration, has
never passed two hours in mixed society without
wishing himself out of it again. Nobody,
however, could guess at this fact from his bright,
frank, and spontaneous gaiety. Always an
abstemious eater       "I have fed at times for
over two months together," he assures his
friends, "on sheer biscuit and water,"       very
little food suffices him: and besides, bien entendu,
he is anxious to retain that "happy slenderness"
on which he prides himself,       the slenderness
which is a characteristic of his family, and which
he has recently endangered by a lazy life in
Venice. The guests sit fascinated by his enthralling
personality: they recognize that he
wears a natural greatness which "his errors
can only half obscure:" and they rivet their
gaze upon that pale and splendid face, the only
one, as Scott says, that ever came up to an
artist's notion of what the lineaments of a poet
should be. He looks around him upon the
ethereal and feminine countenance of Shelley,
the visionary,       the kind, pleasant, honest
English faces of Medwin and Williams,       the
good-looking Italian Gamba, the quaint little
Irishman Taafe,       last, not least, the dark
mustachios and wildly-flashing Celtic eyes of the
Cornish adventurer Trelawny. This latter
might well have served for a model of Conrad
the Corsair: and so he is assured by his companions.



"Sun-burnt his cheek, his forehead high and pale
The sable curls in wild profusion veil        .
His features' deepening lines and varying hue
At times attracted, yet perplex'd the view."

CONRAD AND GULNARE.
"Extreme in love or hate, in good or ill,
The worst of crimes had left her woman still!
This Conrad mark'd, and felt       ah! could he less?       
Hate of that deed, but grief for her distress."
(The Corsair.)


      

      
But where, they ask, shall the original of
Gulnare be found,       Gulnare, who stains her
hand with the blood of her lord the Pasha, to
save the Corsair from a dreadful death? Byron
refuses to reveal his source of inspiration: but
Shelley quotes with sincere approval the lines
which most emphatically delineate that lovely,
desperate woman.




Embark'd, the sail unfurl'd, the light breeze blew       
How much had Conrad's memory to review!        
      
He thought on her afar, his lovely bride:
He turned and saw       Gulnare, the homicide!
      
      
She watch'd his features till she could not bear
Their freezing aspect and averted air;
And that strange fierceness, foreign to her eye,
Fell quench'd in tears, too late to shed or dry.
      
"But for that deed of darkness what wert thou?
Reproach me       but not yet       O! spare me now!
I am not what I seem       this fearful night
My brain bewilder'd       do not madden quite!
If I had never loved, though less my guilt,
Thou hadst not lived to       hate me       if thou wilt."
Extreme in love or hate, in good or ill,
The worst of crimes had left her woman still!
      
This Conrad mark'd, and felt       ah! could he less?
Hate of that deed, but grief for her distress;
What she has done no tears could wash away,
And Heaven must punish on its angry day:
But       it was done: he knew, whate'er her guilt,
For him that poniard smote, that blood was spilt;
And he was free! and she for him had given
Her all on earth, and more than all in heaven!
(The Corsair.)



But       "Heavens, Shelley!" cries his host, "what
infinite nonsense are you quoting?" and he
hastily turns the current of conversation towards
more impersonal subjects.
      
The evening wears on: the guests depart:
the clear spring moonlight streams upon the
winding Arno. Byron stands dreaming at the
open window, the bridges and buildings of Pisa
lie still and silver-lit before him: a subtle influence
of quietude steals down upon him from
the stars. "What nothings we are," he
murmurs, "before the least of these stars!" One
in particular       is it Sirius?       entrances his
attention with its cold refulgence of pure light.
His thoughts involuntarily shape themselves in
rhythm and rhyme;



Sun of the sleepless! melancholy star!
Whose tearful beam glows tremulously far,
That show'st the darkness thou canst not dispel,
How like art thou to joy remember'd well!
So gleams the past, the light of other days,
Which shines, but warms not with its powerless rays;
A night-beam Sorrow watcheth to behold,
Distinct, but distant       clear       but oh! how cold!



It is the hour when Byron's brain becomes
thronged with a glowing phantasmagoria of
ideas that cry aloud for visible expression. He
forgets, under the stress of creative impulse,
the sources and causes of his inherent melancholy,       the
miserable days of his childhood,
with a Fury for a mother,       the wound, never
to be healed, of his unrequited love for Mary
Chaworth,       the inimical wife from whom he is
eternally alienated,       the little daughter that he
may never hold in his arms,       the beloved sister
separated from his side,       the ancestral home of
his forefathers now passed into a stranger's
hold,       the meteoric glory and total eclipse of
his unparalleled popularity in England,       the
follies, and worse than follies, which have made
him what he is, "consistent in nothing but his
passion and his pride." These memories, like
poisonous exhalations, are banished from his
mind, and leave a clear horizon for a while,       a
fertile landscape peopled with great words and
images. Something akin to inspiration seizes
upon him: and he throws himself to work
with all the zest and nerve of his impulsive
nature.
      
This is a man who writes, in his own phrase,
"with rapidity and rarely with pains        .
When I once take pen in hand, I must say
what comes uppermost or fling it away." Not
for him that careful polishing of sentences,
which other writers meticulously bestow. "I
have always written as fast as I could put pen
to paper, and never revised but in the proofs        .
I can never recast anything. I am like
the tiger; if I miss the first spring, I go grumbling
back to my jungle." And to this impetuous
directness of onslaught, his finest poems
bear witness. Some critic has remarked that
Byron is too much of the earth earthy to be a
great lyrical writer: yet a Promethean fire,
stolen from heaven, burns immortally through
some of his shorter lyrics. In Greek, it is said,
there are 1632 ways of expressing the simple
fact I love you: yet who has ever put it in a
more convincing form than Byron does in Maid
of Athens?

MAID OF ATHENS
By those tresses unconfined,
Woo'd by each        gean wind;
By those lids whose jetty fringe
Kiss thy soft cheeks' blooming tinge;
By those wild eyes like the roe,
Z      e mou, sas agapo.


      

      



Maid of Athens, ere we part,
Give, oh give me back my heart!
Or, since that has left my breast,
Keep it now, and take the rest!
Hear my vow before I go.
Z      e mou, sas agapo.
(My life, I love you!)
      
By those tresses unconfined,
Woo'd by each        gean wind;
By those lids whose jetty fringe
Kiss thy soft cheeks' blooming tinge;
By those wild eyes like the roe,
Z      e mou, sas agapo.
      
By that lip I long to taste;
By that zone-encircled waist;
By all the token-flowers that tell
What words can never speak so well;
By love's alternate joy and woe,
Z      e mou, sas agapo.
      
Maid of Athens! I am gone:
Think of me, sweet! when alone.
Though I fly to Istambol,
Athens holds my heart and soul:
Can I cease to love thee? No!
Z      e mou, sas agapo.

      
Rapidly as his pen flies over the paper, the
torrent of throbbing thought flows faster still.
Far on into the night, when ghostly noises echo
through the sleeping palace, "that ever-gushing
and perennial fount of natural waters," as Scott
has described the genius of Byron, pours forth
in reckless profusion. Until at last, outspent
with energy, he draws a deep breath of exhaustion,
and realizes that he is weariness itself.
The moon has sunk in Arno: the stars
are half-way across the sky: a cold glimmer
of dawn is palpitating along the East, as
Byron       
      



"Again to that accustom'd couch must creep
Where joy subsides, and sorrow sighs to sleep."


      
After day's fitful fever he sleeps well: and rest,
a few short hours of it, is due to that perturbed
spirit, which now,



        .O'erlabour'd with his being's strife,
Shrinks to that sweet forgetfulness of life        
That sleep, the loveliest, since it dreams the least.
(Lara.)

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
