FOREWORD

Jimmy Collins used periodically to try to change
his name to Jim Collins, but he never could make it
stick. There was something about him that made
everybody call him Jimmy. He did sign his wonderful
article in the Saturday Evening Post about dive
testing “Jim Collins,” but his friends kidded him so
much about wanting to be a “he-man” that he went
back to Jimmy in his articles for the New York Daily
News.
The article from the Saturday Evening Post,
“Return to Earth,” which is printed in this book, is
the most extraordinary flying story I have ever read,
and as a newspaper and former magazine editor I
have read hundreds of them, from The Red Knight
of Germany down.
Jimmy wrote his own stuff—every word of it. Not
one line has been added to or taken from any of the
stories that appeared in the Daily News. If a story
had any unkindness in it, or reflected on any other
pilot’s ability, Jimmy omitted or changed the name
of the person under reproach.
Jimmy graduated from the army training schools
of Brooks and Kelly fields, in the same class as
Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh. Collins and Lindbergh
were two of the four selected for the pursuit group,
which means they were considered to have the greatest
ability in their class. Jimmy afterwards became
the youngest instructor at Kelly Field.
I was privileged to receive some instruction from
Jimmy. He was a fine teacher, making you know precisely
what he wanted and why. He told me promptly
that I lacked coördination. He said, “Every student
lacks coördination, but you lack more of it than any
student I ever saw.” In driving a car, you can go
forward or backward, left or right. An airplane cannot
go backward. It can go forward, right, left, up,
down. The coördination that Collins kept talking
about meant that when, for instance, you were going
up and to the right, you should do it in one perfect
arc between the two desired points, not in a wavering
line that sometimes bulged and sometimes flattened
itself out.
Pretty near any dub can be taught to fly some
if he has patience enough and can afford to pay for
two or three times as much instruction as the ordinary
man gets. But nobody not born for it can learn
to fly like Collins. His rhythm and reflexes were like
a good orchestra. He was just a natural aviator. He
had the wings of an angel all right, and he was
more at home, more comfortable, more at peace with
himself and the world in the air than he was on the
ground, where he sometimes thought himself to be
a misfit.
Jimmy talked as well as he wrote, drank less than
most aviators, and that’s not so much, and smoked
a considerable number of cigarettes.
Until the last couple of years, when the depression
and his trade had deepened the lines in his face, he
might almost have been called “pretty,” though it
would have been better not to say that to him. He
had light wavy hair, blue eyes, fine white teeth, smiled
a good deal, and as far as his appearance went he
could have been a romantic hero in Hollywood.
He was the most fearless man I ever knew. No, I
take that back. I have known other aviators whom
I considered to be without fear. Collins was as brave
as any of them. Even at best, in spite of what its
adherents say, flying is not a particularly safe business,
and Collins chose the most dangerous branch of
it, that is, dive testing. “Return to Earth,” in this
book, explains that. He said he did it for the money,
which was partly true, but I don’t think entirely so.
I think he liked to pull the whiskers of death and see
if he could get away with it. Anyhow, he had made
a resolution that the dive that killed him should be
his last one. Whether he would have kept that resolution,
I doubt. I think he liked the thrill of having
everybody on the field say, “Jimmy is dive testing a
bomber this afternoon.”
The story, as told by McCory, the photographer,
who had a desk near to him, is that he said to
Collins, “Jimmy, you are making some money now
out of your newspaper articles. Why don’t you stop
this test racket?” And Collins answered, “I will. I
was under contract to do twelve dives on this navy
ship, and I have done eleven. The next one is going
to be my last.” Then he paused, smiled his bright
smile, and said, “At that, it might be.”

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN
I am an American citizen. I was born in Warren, O.,
U. S. A., on April 25, 1904. I am the youngest
of the three remaining children of a family of seven.
My paternal grandfather came to this country from
Ireland. He was a basket weaver by trade and a
Protestant by religion. My father was a bricklayer
by trade. He died when I was five. My mother, whose
people hailed largely from Pennsylvania, scrubbed
floors, took in washings, sewed, baked, made handiwork
and sold it, worked in restaurants, and so managed,
with the help of charity, relatives, and my
older sister when she got old enough to help, to send
me to grammar school and through two years of high
school. Then she died.
I was sixteen. My sister was unable to carry me
further. I went to work in the boot-and-shoe department
of the Goodrich Rubber Factory at Akron, O.
I worked there a year and found conditions and
my prospects intolerable. I applied for permission to
work a part shift at night. It was granted. This reduced
my income but allowed me to go to school in
the daytime.
For three years I worked at night in the factory
and went to school by day. I completed my high
schooling and a year of college (Akron, O.) in this
manner.
Then I applied for entrance to the United States
Army Air Service Primary Flying School, was examined,
found qualified, and admitted. One hundred
and four others were admitted to this same class.
Charles A. Lindbergh was one of them. Our status,
as well as that of the other 104, was that of an
enlisted man with a flying cadet rating.
A year later, in March, 1925, I was one of eighteen
who graduated from the Army Advanced Flying
School, Kelly Field, San Antonio, Tex. The rest of
the 104 had been disqualified during the course, only
the eighteen most apt being kept. Of these eighteen
who graduated, four had been chosen to specialize in
pursuit flying. Lindbergh and myself were two of
these four. Upon graduating from the Advanced
Flying School, I was discharged from the army, and
commissioned a second lieutenant in the United
States Army Reserve Flying Service (now Air
Corps).
I went back to Akron after getting my commission
as a reserve flyer and discovered that there was
no market for my newly acquired ability. I tried to
get a job as mail pilot with N. A. T. in Cleveland
but was told I didn’t have enough experience. I tried
to get a job with Martin Airplane Company in
Cleveland and couldn’t. I was almost broke. I decided
to return to the rubber factories and go back
to school the next fall. I got a job with the Goodyear
Company, in the factory.
But I couldn’t take it any more. I quit the job in
two months and took my one bag and my eighty
dollars and went to Columbus, O., where there was a
reserve flying field. I flew a couple of weeks there,
sleeping in a deserted clubhouse and eating at the
gas station across the street. I was earning no money,
of course, the ship being available to me for practice
only. So I applied for a two weeks’ tour of active
duty at Wright Field and got it. I was paid for that.
While there I applied for a six months’ tour of active
duty at Selfridge Field, and also got that. I was paid
an officer’s (second lieutenant) salary on this duty.
At the expiration of the active duty tour at Selfridge
I applied for another six months but couldn’t
get it because there was no more money available for
that purpose, but I was told that there was some
cadet money left over and that if I was willing to
reënlist as a cadet they could keep me there in that
status for another six months. I decided I would try
to get on with Ford first, and if that failed to accept
the cadet status.
Ford was just getting under way with his tri-motor
aviation venture at that time. He had an airplane
factory at Dearborn Airport. Selfridge Field
is just outside of Detroit, so I moved into Detroit
and applied for a job as pilot at Ford’s Dearborn
Airport. I was told that the only way I could get on
as pilot was first to get a job in the automobile plant,
and that I would later be transferred to the airplane
plant, and still later to the airline between Detroit
and Chicago as pilot. After standing in long lines
every morning for a week I finally got a job in the
automobile factory. I was given a badge with a number
and told to report to such and such a department
the next morning.
Early on the morning I was to start work at the
Ford factory I got on a street car and started for
the plant. I had on work clothes and my badge.
Long lines of workers sat on either side of me. Across
the aisle another long line sat facing me. They sat
with hunched shoulders and vacant faces, dinner
pails on their laps, eyes staring lifelessly at nothing.
The car lurched and jolted along, and their bodies
lurched and jolted listlessly like corpses in it. A sense
of unspeakable horror seized me. I had forgotten the
rubber factories. Now I remembered them again, but
I didn’t remember anything as horrible as this. These
men impressed me as things, not men, horribly identical
things, degraded, hopeless, lifeless units of some
grotesque machines. I felt my identity and my self-respect
oozing out of me. I couldn’t become part of
that. I couldn’t. Not even for a short time. Not even
long enough to get into the airplane factory and
then to become pilot. Not even for that. I wouldn’t.
Not for anything. Life was too short. Even cadet
status in the army was better. I got off the car at the
factory. I watched the men file into the factory. I
shuddered across the street. I caught the next car
back to town. It was like getting away from a prison I
had almost been put into. I went out to Selfridge
Field and enlisted as a cadet.
I began to think. What would I do when the six
months was up? Go back to Akron, the factories, and
school? I couldn’t stand the thought of the factories.
A college degree wouldn’t be worth it. Besides, I
would drop out of aviation. But how? Stay in aviation?
Stay in the army? How? As an enlisted man?
I didn’t like that thought. As an officer? It would
be difficult to get a regular commission, and even so,
where would I get in the army? Go outside and take
my chances? The outside was a cold unfriendly place.
I was afraid of it by then. Your percentage chance
was small outside. The army was warm and secure.
O. K. I’d try to get a commission.
Two months after my sudden decision not to work
in a factory I passed my army exams and got my
commission. But unfortunately I began to read. I
had made up my mind to get the equivalent of a
liberal college degree by reading. And I accidentally
ran across Bernard Shaw. I was twenty-one years
old. All my life I had been keenly aware of contradictions
in life all around me, and all my life they had
worried me and I had wrestled with them, attempting
to resolve them in my own way. Shaw opened a whole
new world to me which I explored eagerly. I was
transferred to Brooks Field, Tex., as an instructor.
I had a lot of fine times. I continued to read Shaw.
The idea of socialism struck me immediately as eminently
just. I agreed with the wrong of capitalism.
I had already thrown over religion. But I remember
that the whole experience left me unsatisfied. The
question of what to do about it kept arising in my
mind. And I remember the inadequacy I felt for the
only implied answer in Shaw’s works I could find,
that to preach was the answer, and hope that the
other preachers in other generations would take up
the good work, until some hazy future generation,
in the dim and distant, the beautiful, and perfect
beyond, would benefit from the preaching and start
living by it—or maybe it would just happen gradually,
evolutionarily, as lungs develop out of gills.
By 1928 I was still in the air corps, instructing,
and reading Shaw. Early in that year I was transferred
from Brooks Field, San Antonio, Tex., to
March Field, Riverside, Calif., and again assigned
to work as instructor. I considered myself a Socialist
by then. I also considered myself a pacifist. To find
one’s self a convinced Socialist and a pacifist and at
the same time a professional soldier, at the age of
twenty-four, places one, if one is conscientious, as I
was, in a considerable dilemma.
In the days when I was instructing army flyers
and reading socialism I still had something that I
fondly and innocently called morals, an evil left-over
from my early and vigorous religious upbringing.
So I decided that the only moral thing I could do
was to get out of the army. Several other practical
considerations supported my “morality” in this decision.
One was the fact that I had had four years
of military training as an aviator. The other was the
fact that Lindbergh had flown to Paris, and, as a
result of the stimulus that aviation received from the
publicity given Lindbergh upon his return, there
existed a commercial market for my flying ability,
in which I could at that time sell that ability for a
much higher wage than the army was paying me
for it.
Accordingly I resigned my commission in the Air
Corps in April, 1928, and accepted a job as airplane
and engine inspector for the newly found
aeronautic branch of the Department of Commerce,
and, after a little schooling at Washington on the
nature of my new duties, and after flying Secretary
McCracken on a long tour around the country, I was
assigned the charge of the Metropolitan area and
headquartered at Roosevelt Field.
I found the post very uncongenial because I
found myself with no assistant, swamped with more
work than I could adequately have handled even with
a couple of assistants, and because there was too
much paper work and office work and too little flying.
So, six months later, after receiving a pay raise
and a letter of commendation, I resigned from the
department and I took a job with Curtiss Flying
Service, which I found much more congenial because
it was almost purely a flying job.
My work there soon attracted the attention of
the Curtiss Airplane and Motor Company, and I was
asked to become their chief test pilot, which I did
in November, 1928.
I worked for them for six months, mostly on military
stuff, and when I resigned to take what I
thought was going to be a better job, I was asked to
stay on with them.
For almost a year after that I was vice president
of a little aviation corporation. The company didn’t
do well. The depression was in full swing. I didn’t
agree with the company policies. Early in 1930 I
resigned.
After my resignation from the vice presidency of
the aviation concern I did private flying—flying for
private owners of aircraft, rich men—and I experienced
wide gaps of unemployment between jobs. But
since I left the army I had been reading and thinking
about “social” matters. I ran across the “radical”
press in New York. I began reading Walter
Duranty in the Times. I read books on Russia. I
fought against the idea of communism. It seemed
stupid and crude to me. But step by step—I stubbornly
fought all the way—the beautifully clear
logic of communism broke down all my barriers, and
I was forced to admit to myself that the Bolsheviks
had the only complete and effective answer to the
riddle of the world I lived in.
I began to consider myself a Communist. My
bourgeois friends, and they ranged from the very
elite to the petty, thought I was nuts. I, in turn,
thought they were unreasonable and talked myself
blue in the face trying to convince them of it. I
became quite a parlor pink. It took me a couple of
years to realize the futile ridiculousness of my antics,
of attempting to turn the bourgeoisie to communism.
It took me that long because I didn’t at first grasp
the full implications of the class basis of my convictions
and did not realize that, like a fish out of water,
I was a born and bred proletarian justified by
peculiar circumstances with a position of isolation from
my class and with contact with an alien class.
And when that realization began to dawn on me—dimly
at first—the question of what to do about it
again arose in my mind.
I pondered the matter a long time. I was already
over the romantic notion that the thing to do was to
go to Russia, as I had had a spell of thinking. I
sensed that that, in a way, would be running away.
It occurred to me to join the party, but I didn’t
know exactly how to go about it or even if I could.
I furthermore didn’t get a very clear picture of just
what good I could do even if I did. I was also, having
got married and begun a family in the meantime,
pretty much absorbed in personal adjustment and
just the plain economic details necessary to existence.
It finally occurred to me that I could do something
for the radical cause right where I was, in aviation,
instead of going to Russia. But what? And how? I
didn’t know. I decided that there were undoubtedly
people in the party who did. If you want to build a
house, go to an architect. If you want to build an
airplane, go to an aeronautical engineer. If you
want to build a revolutionary organization, go to a
revolutionary leader. It was a naïve but a direct, an
honest, and a logical method of reasoning, you must
admit. So I found out from the Daily Worker where
headquarters was and went down.
I felt a little ridiculous and abashed when I got
there. I sensed, rather than reasoned, that I was
suspected because of my approach. It didn’t bother
me enough to stop me, because I was sincere, but it
did embarrass me.
Shortly after that, at Roosevelt, I accidentally
ran across a mimeographed four-page paper, the
organ of a club of aviation students. I picked it up
and idly began reading it. It sat me bolt upright in
my chair. It expressed everything that I felt. I had
thought I was an exception, that nobody else in the
whole game felt as I did about economic, social, and
political matters. But this paper indicated that I
wasn’t a complete exception. It excited me terrifically.
I noted the name of the paper and the name
of the club that had issued it. I had never before
heard of either one. I ran around madly asking
everybody I knew what the club was, where it was,
who it was. I couldn’t find out much, but I did find
where the club rooms were and when meetings were
held. I went down to the next meeting. I joined up.
Out of that organization grew another, on a
broader basis, planned to move adequately to meet
the needs of the workers as a whole in the industry,
which was still small, and of which I was an active
member.
Word of my organizing activities with this group
got around to my boss, and that, together with other
things, was the reason for my being fired from my
job of private pilot for a certain very rich man.
After being discharged for radical activity by my
rich boss I learned discretion, which, somebody said
long ago, is the better part of valor. And I did not
lose my valor: I continued to work with the disapproved
group. But I was out of a job, and I had a
wife and two small children to support. I had also
learned a few things, so that I knew them now
utterly, and not only intellectually, as I did a while
ago. One of them is the class basis of my convictions.
I began inquiring, and I learned that I was the only
pilot of my training and experience that I knew of
who had a working-class background. All others that
I knew, and also a good many mechanics, had middle-class
background. That accounted for the different
way I saw things.
I was now face to face with a peculiar problem.
Unemployment was rampant in this industry as in
every other. In looking for a job, I discovered that
the Chinese government (Nationalist-Nanking and
Canton) was looking for a few men. I submitted
qualifications to a high-ranking Chinese in this country
and was answered by him that owing to my
military and testing experience I was eminently
qualified, and that he would set machinery in motion
immediately to get me a job. China, of course, was
very busy building up a Nationalist air force. I
would be used as an adviser in their school and
factories.
But I was a Communist. Would the Chinese Nationalist
Air Force, which I would be helping to
build up, be used against the Chinese Soviets?
Against the U. S. S. R.? And still I must earn a
living. What if several prospects I had for jobs
failed to materialize before the Chinese proposition
did? Should I or should I not go? If I went, what
rôle should I play? How dangerous would my position
be? Would I be of more value here, now that
our organizational efforts were bearing fruit? And
so on did the questions in my mind run.
At that time my wife and two small children were
on the farm with my mother-in-law and father-in-law
in Oklahoma. What should I do?



RETURN TO EARTH
I was sitting around the restaurant at Roosevelt
Field Hotel with the rest of the unemployed pilots,
smoking, talking, sipping the eternal cup of coffee,
hoping that something would turn up, when the
phone rang and the girl who answered it called for
me.
“It’s long distance,” she added as I brushed past
her on my way out to take the call, and I couldn’t
help running the rest of the way. I had put in word
at a factory some time ago if anything turned up to
let me know. Maybe my luck was changing.
“Hello,” I said eagerly as I grabbed the receiver,
and before the familiar voice on the other end told
me I knew I was talking to the guy who hired the
pilots for the company.
“I’ve got a job for you,” he announced, “demonstrating
one of our new airplanes for the navy.”
“What kind of a demonstration?” I asked warily.
“A dive demonstration,” he said. I knew what
that meant all right. Ten thousand feet straight
down, just to see if it would hang together. I wasn’t
so sure my luck was changing after all.
“What kind of a ship?” I asked. I hoped it wasn’t
too experimental. I had dived airplanes before. The
last one, six years before, I had dived to pieces. I
still remembered the exploding crack of those wings
tearing off. I remember the dazing blow of the instrument
board as my head had snapped forward
against it from the sudden lurch of the midair failure,
and dimly then the slow, limp slumping into unconsciousness.
I remembered how I had come to,
thousands of feet later, and leaped my way clear,
only to be threatened by the falling wreck on top
and the rushing-at-me earth beneath. I remembered
the tumbling, jerking stop as my chute had opened
after the long drop, and how startlingly close the
ground had looked. I remembered how white and
safe against the blue sky those billowing folds of that
chute had looked, and then immediately the awful
heart-pound, breath-stop fear that that milling
wreck would take a derelict pass at it. I remembered
the acute relief of hearing the loud report that told
me the wreck had hit the ground, and then the
“What if that had clutched me!” when they told me
afterward how close it really had come.
“It’s a bomber fighter, second model, first-production
job, a single-seater biplane with a seven-hundred-horsepower
engine,” the man at the other
end said. That was encouraging anyway. It wasn’t
the experimental job.
I had heard that another free-lance test pilot like
myself had recently jumped out of a ship he had
been diving. His prop had broken and torn his motor
clear out of his ship. He had got down with his
chute all right, but he had hit the fin as he had gone
past the tail surfaces getting out of the wreck. He
had broken a couple of legs and an arm and was in
the hospital at that moment. I knew he had been
doing some diving.
I wondered why they didn’t use one of their own
men. They had a very fine staff of test pilots right
there at the factory. “What’s wrong with your
pilots?” I asked.
“Well, to be frank about it,” was the answer,
“while we really don’t expect any trouble with this
ship, because we have taken every possible precaution
that we know about, still, you never can tell.
Our chief test pilot now, you know, has done seven
of these dive demonstrations. We feel that that is
about enough to ask one man to do on a salary, and
he feels that he has had about enough anyway. None
of the rest of our men have ever done any of this
work before. Besides, why should we take a chance
on breaking up our organization if we can call a free
lance in?” So that was it! After all, why shouldn’t
they look at it that way?
I thought of the already long absence of my
family. My wife and my year-and-a-half-old son
and my half-year-old daughter were still on my
father-in-law’s farm in Oklahoma, where I had sent
them in the spring to make sure they would be able
to eat during the summer. If I could make enough
money——
“How much is there in it for me?” I asked.
“Fifteen hundred dollars,” he said. “If the job
takes longer than ten days we will pay you an
additional thirty-five dollars a day. We will insure
your life for fifteen thousand dollars for the duration
of the demonstrations and provide for disability compensation.
We will also pay your expenses, of course.
So, if you are still free, white, and twenty-one—”
His voice trailed off, posing the question.
“Well, I’m still free and white,” I answered, “but
I am no longer twenty-one. I’m thirty now, you
know. Old enough to know better. But I’ll take your
job.”
“We will wire you as soon as the ship is ready,”
he said and hung up.
I came back to the gang at the table. They were
still sipping their coffee, smoking, talking, and undoubtedly
hoping for an odd job to come in.
“I’ve got a job,” I announced, beaming.
“What kind of a job?” they all piped up.
“Diving one of the new fighters for the navy,”
I replied as casually as I could.
“Boy, you can have it!” they chorused.
“I’ve got it,” I snapped. “And anyway,” I added,
“I won’t be dropping dead of starvation around here
this winter.”
They razzed me for a while, and I razzed them
back. They wanted to know what kind of flowers I
wanted. I wanted to know if they were planning on
just breakfast or just dinner when they got down to
that one meal a day this winter.
After a while, as soon as my elation in contemplation
of the fifteen hundred bucks wore off, I didn’t
feel so cocky. I really might get bumped off in that
crate. Maybe I could have got by without taking
the job.
I remembered that dive of six years before. It had
been different then. It hadn’t occurred to me at that
time that airplanes would fall apart. Oh, I knew
they would. I knew they had. It was something,
however, that had happened to other test pilots and
might happen to some more, but not to me.
I remembered the times I had jumped, startled
wide awake from sleep in the nights, not immediately
after that failure, but some months later. No special
dreams of horror. Just the delayed action of some
subterranean mechanism of fright in my subconscious
brain. I had been honestly convinced during
my waking hours up to that time that that failure
had not made much of an impression on me.
I remembered the subconscious fear of just normal
excess speed that had grown on me since then. I
wouldn’t nose an airplane down very much from level
cruising speed and open the throttle coming in from
a cross-country, for instance. A couple of times when
I had done it without thinking, I had found myself
practically bending the throttle backwards to kill
the speed when I had suddenly become aware of it.
These things convinced me that that failure had
made a deeper impression on me than I had thought.
I realized it the more when I contemplated these
new dives I was about to do. I knew I was more
afraid of them than I would admit.
“Death in the Afternoon, or Reunion in Oklahoma,”
I thought. You’ve got to take some chances.
I didn’t see how I was going to get the money to
bring the family back any other way.
Besides, I thought I could beat the game by being
smart. I knew a lot of boys who hadn’t been able to,
and I knew they had had good heads on their
shoulders.

Two weeks later I stepped out of a taxi in front of
the hangar at the airport. Some experimental military
airplanes were sitting outside. It was good to see
military airplanes again. There is something about
military airplanes—something businesslike.
I entered the hangar office. The engineers were
waiting for me. I knew most of them from working
with them before. They were all still just pink-faced
kids. But I knew they were bright kids. They knew
their stuff and had all had quite a lot of experience.
They greeted me with a queer sort of smile on their
faces, the way you greet somebody you know is being
played for a sucker. Maybe they were right. Undoubtedly
they were. But I resented that smile in
a mild sort of way.
Bill was there. I had known Bill since before he
had become their chief test pilot. He had that same
queer smile on his face.
“Hey, Bill,” I said to him, greeting him with a
quizzical smile answering his own, “why don’t you
dive this funny airplane?”
“I got smart and chiseled my way out of this
one,” he said.
“It is a sap’s game,” I agreed with him. “But
starvation is dangerous too.” He laughed, and we
all laughed.
He studied me for a minute. We hadn’t seen each
other in a couple of years. Finally he said soberly,
“You’ve grown older, Jim.”
“Yeah, I’ve grown older, Bill,” I answered him
banteringly, “and I want to grow a lot older too. I
want to have a nice long white beard trailing out in
the slip stream some day. So I hope you guys are
building good airplanes for diving. By the way, let’s
go out in the hangar and take a look at the crate.
After all, I’m mildly interested in it, you know.”
We all went out into the hangar. There was the
ship, suspended from a chain hoist with its wheels
just off the cement in the middle of a large cleared
area. It was silver and gleamed even in the somewhat
darkened interior. It looked sturdy and squat
and bulldoggish, as only a military fighting ship
can. I was glad it looked sturdy.
A group of mechanics were swarming around it
and over it and under it. They all looked up as we
approached the ship. I knew most of them. I was
introduced to the others. You could see that they
felt toward that ship as a brood hen feels toward
her eggs. They didn’t want me to break it. I didn’t
want to break it either.
I walked around the ship and looked it over. The
engineers pointed out special features and talked
metal construction and forged fittings and stress
analysis and safety factors, and I asked questions.
I was fascinated by the wires that braced the wings.
They looked big enough to hold up the Brooklyn
Bridge. I liked those wires.
I learned that a pilot had been up there and had
gone over the whole stress analysis with them and
had recommended only one little change in the ship,
which had been made. I learned that he had expressed
willingness to dive the ship after that, but
that he had been unable to because another job he
had contracted to do some time previously was coming
up at the same time this one was. I was glad to
hear this man had gone over the ship. He was not
only one of the most, if not the most, competent
test pilots in the country, but also a very good
engineer, which I was not.
I crawled into the cockpit. There were more
gadgets in it. Something for everything except putting
wings back on in the air. The racket had
changed, I decided. In the old days, dive demonstrating
hadn’t been so accurate a thing. You took
a ship up and did a good dive with it and came down
and everybody was happy. But now, as I could see,
they had developed a lot of recording as well as indicating
instruments. You used to be able to get away
with something. You couldn’t get away with anything
now. They could take a look at all those trick
instruments after you had come down and tell just
what you had done. They could tell accurately and
didn’t have to take your word for it.
There was one instrument there, for instance, that
the pilot couldn’t see. It was called a vee-gee recorder.
It made a pattern on a smoked glass of about
the size of one of those paper packets of matches.
This pattern told them, after the pilot had come
down, just how fast he had dived, what kind of a
dive he had made, and what kind of a pull-out he
had done.
There was another instrument there that I had
never seen before. It looked something like a speedometer
and was called an accelerometer. I was soon
to find out what that was for! Oh, they told me what
it was for then. They explained everything in the
cockpit to me, and I sat there and familiarized myself
with it as best I could on the ground before
taking the ship out. But I wasn’t really to find out
what that accelerometer was for until I used it. And
did I find out then!
We rolled the ship out that afternoon, after last-minute
adjustments had been made on it—an airplane
is like a woman that way: it always has to have
last-minute adjustments—and I made a familiarization
flight in it. I just took it off and flew it around
at first. Then I began feeling it out. I rocked it and
horsed it and yanked it and pulled it and watched.
I watched the wires, the wings, the tail. Any unusual
flexing? Abnormal vibration? Any flutter? I brought
the ship down and had it inspected that night.
The next day I did the same thing. But I went a
little bit further this time. I built up some speed. I
did shallow dives. I listened and felt and watched.
I did steeper dives. Anything unusual?
This went on for several days. Some minor
changes and adjustments were made. Finally I said
I was ready to start the official demonstrations,
and the official naval observers were called out to
watch.
I did five speed dives first. These were to demonstrate
that the ship would dive to terminal velocity.
Contrary to popular opinion, a falling object will
not go faster and faster and faster and faster. It will
go faster and faster only up to a certain point. That
point is reached when the object creates by its own
passage through the air enough air resistance to that
passage to equal in pounds the weight of the object.
When that point is reached, the object will not fall
any faster, no matter how much longer it falls. It is
said to be at terminal velocity. A diving airplane is
only a falling object, but it is a highly streamlined
one, and therefore capable of a very high terminal
velocity. A man falling through the air cannot attain
a speed greater than about a hundred and twenty
miles an hour. But the terminal velocity of an airplane
is a lot more than that.
I led up to it carefully. I went to fifteen thousand
feet to start the first dive. The ship dove smooth and
steady. I pulled out at three hundred miles an hour
and climbed back up to do the next dive. I dove to
three hundred and twenty miles an hour this time.
Everything was fine. Everything was fine as far as
I could tell, but when I had eased out of the dive I
brought the ship down for inspection before I did
the next two dives.
I did the next two dives to three hundred and forty
miles an hour and three hundred and sixty. I lost
seven thousand feet in the last one. It had me casting
the old fish eye around to see if everything was holding
before I got through it. Everything held, but I
brought the ship down for inspection again before
the final speed dive.
I went to eighteen thousand feet for the final one.
It was cold up there, and the sky was very blue. I
lined all up facing down wind and found myself
checking everything very methodically. Was I in
high pitch? Was the mixture rich? Was the landing
gear folded tightly? Was the stabilizer rolled? Was
the rudder tab adjusted? I was a little extra methodical
and extra deliberate. I knew that my mind
wasn’t normally clear. I was breathing harder than
usual. It was the altitude. There wasn’t enough
oxygen. I was a little groggy.
I was a little worried about my ears. I had always
had to blow my ears out when just normally losing
altitude. I had funny ears like that that wouldn’t
adjust themselves. I might break an eardrum.
I eased the throttle back, rolled the ship over in a
half roll, and stuck her down. I felt the dead, still
drop of the first part of the dive. I saw the air-speed
needle race around its dial, heard the roaring of the
motor mounting and the whistle of the wires rising,
and felt the increasing stress and stiffness of the
gathering speed. I saw the altimeter winding up—winding
down, rather! Down to twelve thousand feet
now. Eleven and a half. Eleven. I saw the air-speed
needle slowing down its racing on its second lap
around the dial. I heard the roaring motor whining
now, and the whistling wires screaming, and felt the
awful racking of the terrific speed. I glanced at
the air-speed needle. It was barely creeping around
the dial. It was almost once and a half around and
was just passing the three-eighty mark. I glanced at
the altimeter. It was really winding up now! The
sensitive needle was going around and around. The
other needle read ten thousand, nine and a half, nine.
I looked at the air-speed needle. It was standing still.
It read three ninety-five. You could feel it was terminal
velocity. You could feel the lack of acceleration.
You could hear it too. You could hear the motor at
a peak whine, holding it. You could hear the wires
at a peak scream, holding it. I checked the altimeter.
Eight and a half. At eight I would pull out.
Suddenly something shifted on the instrument
board and something hit me in the face. I sickeningly
remembered that dazing smack on the head of six
years before, and the old electric startle shock convulsed
me as I remembered the resounding crack of
those wings tearing off. I involuntarily took a fear-glazed
glance at my wings and instinctively tightened
up on the stick and began to ease out of the
dive. Through the half-daze pull-out and the dawning
ice-cold clearness always aftermathing fright I
dimly checked the trouble while I leveled out. When
I had got level and got things quieted down and my
head had cleared I saw that I was right. Only the
glass cover had vibrated off the manifold-pressure
instrument, and the needle had popped off the dial.
I was thoroughly shaken. And I was mad because I
had allowed so little a thing to upset me so much.
I checked my altimeter. It read five thousand feet.
I figured I had dived eleven thousand and taken
two for recovery.
My ears had a lot of pressure on them. I held both
nostrils and blew. The pressure inside popped my
ears out easily. They were going to stand the diving
all right.
I brought the ship down to be inspected that night
and decided to celebrate the successful conclusion of
the long dive. Cirrus clouds were forming high up
in the blue sky, so I figured maybe I could do it
safely. I went up to the weather bureau on the field
to check on it.
“How is the weather for tomorrow?” I asked.
“Terrible, I hope.”
“I think it will be,” the weather man said. He consulted
his charts further. “Yes, it will be,” he assured
me.
“Definitely?” I pressed him.
He looked his charts over again. “Yes,” he reassured
me, “definitely. You won’t be able to fly tomorrow.”
“Swell!” I exclaimed to the mildly startled man.
He didn’t quite get it.
It was lousy the next morning, all right. You
couldn’t see across the field. Even the birds were
walking. The engineers were dismayed. They wanted
to get on with the demonstrations. I was overjoyed.
I had a head. I had celebrated a little too much.
Along about the middle of the morning it began
to lift. The engineers began to cheer up. I watched
with gathering apprehension while it lifted still
further and began to break. In an incredibly short
time there were only a few clouds in the sky. I was
practically sick about it, but the engineers, with
beaming faces, were having the ship pushed out.
I went up to the field lunch wagon to get a cup of
coffee while the mechanics warmed up the ship.
I went back down to the hangar and crawled into
the ship to do the first two of the next set of five
dives. These were to demonstrate pull-outs instead
of speed. Here was where I found out what the accelerometer
was for.
I knew that the accelerometer was to indicate the
force of the pull-outs. I knew that it indicated them
in terms of g, or gravity. I knew that in level flight
it registered one g, which meant, among other things,
that I was being pulled into my seat with a force
equal to my own weight, or one hundred and fifty
pounds. I knew that when I pulled out of a dive, the
centrifugal force of the pull-out would push the g
reading up in exactly the same proportion that it
would pull me down into my seat. I knew that I had
to pull out of a ten-thousand-foot dive hard enough
to push the g reading up to nine, and pull me down
into my seat with a force equal to nine times my own
weight, or thirteen hundred and fifty pounds. I knew
that that would put a considerable stress on the airplane,
and that that was the reason the Navy wanted
me to do it; they wanted to see if it could take it.
But what I didn’t know was that it would put such
a terrific stress on me. I had no idea what a nine g
pull-out meant to the pilot.
I decided to start the dives out at three hundred
miles an hour and increase each succeeding dive in
increments of twenty miles an hour for the first four
dives, as I had in the speed dives. I decided to pull
out of the first dive to five and a half g, and pull out
of each succeedingly faster dive one g harder, until I
had pulled out of the fourth dive of three hundred
and sixty miles an hour to eight and a half g. Then
I would do the grand dive of ten thousand feet to
terminal velocity and pull out to nine g.
I took off and went up to fifteen thousand feet
and stuck her down to three hundred miles an hour.
I horsed back on the stick and watched the accelerometer.
Up she went, and down into my seat I went.
Centrifugal force, like some huge invisible monster,
pushed my head down into my shoulders and
squashed me into that seat so that my backbone bent
and I groaned with the force of it. It drained the
blood from my head and started to blind me. I
watched the accelerometer through a deepening haze.
I dimly saw it reach five and a half. I eased up on
the stick, and the last thing I saw was the needle
starting back to one. I was blind as a bat. I was
dizzy as a coot. I looked out at my wings on both
sides. I couldn’t see them. I couldn’t see anything. I
watched where the ground ought to be. Pretty soon
it began to show up like something looming out of a
morning mist. My sight was returning, due to the
eased pressure from letting up on the stick. Soon I
could see clearly again. I was level, and probably
had been for some time. But my head was hot with a
queer sort of burning sensation, and my heart was
pounding like a water ram.
“How am I going to do a nine-g pull-out if I am
passing out on five and a half?” I thought. I decided
that I had held it too long and that I would get the
next reading quicker and release it sooner, so I
wouldn’t be under the pressure so long.
I noticed that my head was completely cleared
from the night before. I didn’t know whether it was
the altitude or the pull-out. One or the other, or both,
I decided, was good for hang-overs.
I climbed back to fifteen thousand feet and stuck
her down to three hundred and twenty miles an hour.
I horsed back quick on the stick this time. I overshot
six and a half and hit seven before I released it. I
could feel my guts being sucked down as I fought
for sight and consciousness, but the quicker pull and
the earlier release worked, and I was able to read the
instruments at the higher g.
I brought the ship down for inspection. Everything
was all right. I went back up again and did
the next two. They sure did flatten me out, but the
ship took it fine. I brought it down for a thorough
inspection that night.
I felt like I had been beaten. My eyes felt like
somebody had taken them out and played with them
and put them back in again. I was droopy tired and
had sharp shooting pains in my chest. My back
ached, and that night I blew my nose and it bled. I
was a little worried about that nine-g business.
The next morning was one of those crisp, golden
autumn days. The sky was as blue as indigo and as
clear as a mountain stream. One of those good days
to be alive.
To my surprise, I felt fine. “Those pull-outs must
be a tonic,” I thought.
I went out to do the terminal-velocity dive with
the nine-g pull-out. I found that the last dive I had
done the day before had flattened out the fairing on
the belly of the ship. The sudden change of attitude
of the ship in the eight-and-a-half g pull-out had
pushed the belly up against that pretty solid three-hundred-and-sixty-mile-an-hour
blast of air and
crushed the metal bracings that held the belly fairing
in shape as neatly as if you had gone over it with
a steam roller. It was not a structural part of the
ship, however, as far as strength went, and could be
repaired that day. They decided to beef up the bracings
when they repaired it.
While I was waiting on the repair I talked with a
navy commander who had just flown up from Washington.
I told him my worry about the nine g. He
said to yell as I horsed back and it would help. I
thought he was kidding me. It seemed so silly. But
he was serious. He said it would tense the muscles
of the abdomen and the neck and preserve sight and
consciousness longer.
Somebody during that wait told me about an
army pilot who, several years before, in some tests
at Wright Field, had accidentally got too much g,
due to a faulty accelerometer. He got some
enormously high reading like twelve or fourteen. He ruptured
his intestines and broke blood vessels in his
brain. He was in the hospital about a year and finally
got out. He would never be right again, they told
me. He was a little bit goofy. I thought to myself
that anybody doing this kind of work was a little
bit goofy to begin with. I decided not to get any
more than nine g if I could help it.
That afternoon I went up to eighteen thousand
feet again and rolled her over and stuck her down.
Again the dead, still drop and the mounting roar.
Again the flickering needles on the instruments and
the job of reading them. You never see the ground in
one of those dives. You are too busy watching things
in the cockpit. Again the tensing fear for thirty
whining, screaming seconds while your life is a held
breath and the fear of your death is a crouching
shadow in a dark corner. Again the mounting racking
of the ship until it seems no humanly built thing
can stand the stress of that speed much longer.
At eight thousand feet on the altimeter I shifted
my gaze to the accelerometer and horsed. I used both
hands. I wanted to get the reading as quickly as
possible. That unseen violence, punishing this time,
fairly crunched me into my seat, so that I only
darkly saw the needle passing nine. I realized somehow
that I was overshooting and let up on the stick.
As my head unwound and my eyes cleared up I
noticed that I was level already and that the recording
needle on the accelerometer read nine and a half.
I checked my altimeter. It read six and a half thousand
feet.
When I got back on the ground the commander,
who had seen a lot of those dives, said, “Boy, I
thought you were never going to pull that out. You
had me shouting out loud, ‘Pull it out! Pull it out!’
And when you did pull it out, did you wrap it!”
I felt I had. I felt all torn down inside. I had forgotten
to yell. My back ached like somebody had
kicked me. I was really woozy. I was glad I didn’t
have to do those every day.
I wasn’t through yet. During the rest of the afternoon,
under a variety of load conditions, I looped,
snap-rolled, slow-rolled, spun, did true Immelmanns,
and flew upside down.
I still wasn’t through. I flew the ship to Washington
the next day. The work at the factory had been
only the preliminary demonstration!
At Washington I had to do three take-offs and
landings, all the maneuvers over again under the
different load conditions, and two more terminal-velocity,
nine-g pull-out dives by way of final demonstration.
Just as I was getting ready to go out and do the
three take-offs and landings, the navy squadron
that was going to use these ships if the navy bought
any of them showed up in a flock of fighters. About
twenty-seven of them. They landed, lined up in a
neat row beside my ship, got out and clustered
around to watch me. I got stage fright. Here was a
group of the hottest experts in the country. I had
paid little attention to my landings at the factory,
being too intent on the other work. What if I bungled
those landings right there in front of that gang?
Three simple little take-offs and landings really
had me buffaloed, but I worked hard on them, and
they turned out all right. Doing the maneuvers
under the different load conditions during the rest of
the day was practically fun after that.
The next day I came out to do the final two dives.
I had to go to Dahlgren to do them. So many airplanes
had fallen apart over Anacostia and gone
through houses and started fires and raised hell in
general that the District of Columbia had prohibited
diving in that vicinity. Dahlgren was only about
thirty miles south and just nicely took up the climbing
time.
The first dive went fine, and I had one more to
go. I hated that one more. Everything had been so
all right so far, and I hated to think that something
might happen in that last dive.
I thought of the wife and kids as I climbed for
altitude. It was a swell day. I checked everything
carefully. I rolled over into the dive and started
down. I caught a glimpse of the blue earth far beneath,
so remote. Then to the instruments while I
crouched and hated the mounting stress of the terrific
speed. About mid-dive I saw something in front
of my face. It took me a second to recognize it. It
was the Very pistol, used for shooting flare signals
at sea. It had come out of its holster at the right side
of the cockpit and was floating around in space between
my face and my knees. I grabbed it with my
throttle hand and started to throw it over my left
shoulder to get rid of it, but quickly decided that
that wouldn’t be such a smart thing to do. A three
or four hundred mile an hour slip stream was lurking
just outside there. It would have grabbed that
pistol and dashed it into the tail surfaces, and it
would have been good-bye airplane. I fumbled it
from one hand to the other and finally kept it in my
throttle hand. I noticed that I had allowed the ship
to nose up out of the dive ever so slightly during
that wrestling match, and I spent the rest of the dive
nosing it ever so slightly back in. That nose-back-in
showed up as negative acceleration on the vee-gee
recorder. And in addition to that, although I pulled
out to nine and a half g on the accelerometer, something
had gone wrong with it, because the pull-out
turned out to be only seven and a half g on the vee-gee
recorder.
The navy threw that dive out, so I still had one
more to do. Still one more, and by then one more was
a mental hazard difficult to overcome. I have a morbid
imagination anyway. I knew that the motor and prop
had taken a severe beating so far. Maybe one more
would be just too much. Maybe something—something
that had eluded inspection, perhaps—was just
about ready to let go, and I was so damned near the
finish. Besides, although I am not superstitious, the
rejected dive made that last one the thirteenth.
They gave me a check for fifteen hundred dollars
the next day and canceled my insurance. My old car
wouldn’t have got as far as Oklahoma, and wasn’t
big enough anyway, so I had to break a new one in
on the way down. I was back with the family in good
shape, but they still had to eat, and fifteen hundred
dollars wouldn’t last forever, so I was looking for
another job. I thought I had one coming up ... a
diving job!



COLLISION, ALMOST
I took off from Newark with about a seven-thousand-foot
ceiling after dark. The ceiling came down
as I went farther and farther into the mountains
toward Bellefonte, but it didn’t come down too much.
I got to Sunbury, about fifty miles from Bellefonte,
and started into the worst part of the mountains.
Then I hit snow.
I went over the first big ridge on the blinkers,
closely spaced red lights between beacons in bad
spots. It was thick in the valley beyond, but I could
just make out the beacon on the next ridge.
I flew up to it, couldn’t see the next beacon, went
on past from that beacon as far as I dared, but
couldn’t find the next beacon without losing that one.
So I went back to it.
I made several excursions out toward the next
beacon before I could find it without losing the one
I had. Then I couldn’t find the next one.
I circled and circled about fifty feet over that
beacon on the mountain top in the driving snow. I
couldn’t go backward toward the last one. I couldn’t
go forward toward the next. I was quite sure the next
was the field beacon at Bellefonte, but I didn’t dare
go out far enough to find it.
I knew I couldn’t sit there and circle all night.
The snow was not abating. I had to do something.
Finally I pulled off the beacon in a climbing spiral,
headed off blind in what I thought was the direction
of the next beacon—what I hoped it was!—and
hoped to see it under me through the snow if I flew
over it, and if not, to keep on going, blind, until I
flew out of the mountains, the snow, or both.
I was lucky, flew right over it, saw dimly down beneath
me through the driving snow the Bellefonte
Airport boundary lights, spiraled down and landed.
Not five minutes later an air-mail ship came in
from the same direction and landed. I asked the pilot
how close he had come to the beacon I had been circling.
He said he had flown right over it. Can you
imagine what would have happened if I had still
been sitting there circling that beacon when he came
barging along through the snow right over it? He
said he was flying on his instruments for the most
part. He undoubtedly wouldn’t have seen me. I
wouldn’t have seen him. Our meeting probably
wouldn’t have been so pleasant!



HE HAD WHAT IT TOOK
Eddie Stinson, that colorful and beloved figure of
American aviation, has gone West. But the many
stories that cluster around his almost legendary
name, live on.
Dick Blythe, the man who handled Lindbergh’s
publicity just after Lindbergh’s return from Paris,
tells me this one about Eddie. Eddie told it to him.
Eddie was working with a crowd that was representing
the German Junkers plane in America. One
of the things they were trying to do was sell it to the
Post Office Department for use on the air-mail lines.
To attract attention to the superior performance
of the ship Eddie decided to make a non-stop flight
from Chicago to New York. He decided to fly
straight over the Alleghanies.
Flying the Alleghanies is common nowadays, what
with modern equipment, lighted airways, blind flying
instruments and radio. But in those days it was
a feat.
Eddie was delayed in taking off and didn’t get
over the mountains until after dark. Then his imagination
began to work overtime.
That happens to a great many of us many times.
A motor can be running along perfectly until you
get over a spot where you can’t afford to have it
quit. Then you begin worrying about it and can invariably
find something wrong. If all the motors quit
under the conditions that all pilots fear, there would
be as many wrecked ships scattered over the country
as there are signboards.
Anyway, Eddie got to thinking his motor was
rough. But he was prepared for the situation. He
reached down under his seat and pulled out a bottle
of gin. He took a long swig and listened to his motor
again. It had smoothed right out.
Every once in a while the motor would get rough
again, and Eddie would reach down and take another
swig. He said it took him the whole quart of gin to
smooth that motor out and get the ship over the
mountains and onto Curtiss Field.



DRY MOTOR
One of the customs in the army, if you were out on
a cross-country flight, was not to look at the weather
map to see if the weather was all right to go home,
and not to look at your ship to see if it was in good
enough shape to make the trip, but to look in your
pocket and see if you had enough money to stay any
longer.
I didn’t have, so I piled into my old wing-radiatored
PW-8 and took off from Washington for Selfridge
Field. I knew I was going to have trouble with
the radiators.
I climbed slowly on reduced throttle, reaching for
the cold air of altitude. I watched the water temperature
indicator, but before it registered boiling
I was surprised to see steam coming from the radiators.
I remembered then. Water boils at a lower
and lower temperature the higher you go. I still
thought the lower temperatures of altitude would
offset that, so I throttled my motor to the minimum
necessary for level flight until the radiator stopped
steaming, then opened it a little and tried to sneak a
little more altitude before it steamed again.
I worked myself up to six thousand feet like that.
I was watching for steam for the umpteenth time,
hoping to make Pittsburgh before I ran out of water,
when I saw white smoke coming out of the exhausts.
I was out of water and was burning the oil off the
cylinder walls.
I cut the switches. The speed of my glide kept the
prop turning over like a windmill. I picked a field
in the country and started talking to myself: “Take
it easy—Slow her down—Come around—Don’t undershoot
whatever you do—Hold it now, you’re overshooting—Slip
it—Not too much—You’re undershooting
again—Kick those switches on—Gun it—All
right, kick him off—Watch those trees—The
fence now—You’re slow—Let ’er drop, the field’s
small—Wham!—Watch your roll—Ground loop at
the end if you have—You don’t—You made it.” I
always talk to myself like that in a forced landing.
I don’t remember how much water I put in the
thing. I do remember that there was only a pint in
it when I had landed. And I had kept from burning
up the motor!
I took off again and made Pittsburgh, Akron,
Cleveland, and Toledo, steaming, but without running
clear dry. I probably had a few more gray hairs
when I finally landed at Selfridge, but everything
else was all right.



IMAGINATION
A friend of mine got an aërial mapping job last
summer. He had to fly at twenty thousand feet to
take the pictures. Some pilots can stand more altitude
than others, but my friend didn’t know how
much he could stand because he had never flown that
high. He decided he had better take oxygen with
him, just in case.
His mechanic got a cylinder of oxygen for him,
and he took off. He felt pretty groggy at eighteen
thousand feet, reached down, got the hose, put it
in his mouth, turned on the valve, and took a whiff
of oxygen. He couldn’t hear the hissing of the stuff
escaping because the motor noise drowned it out.
He perked up immediately. The sky brightened,
everything became clearer to him, and he went on up
to twenty thousand feet. Every once in a while he
would feel low and reach down and get himself another
whiff of oxygen and feel all right again for a
while.
He didn’t say anything to his mechanic, but his
mechanic decided for himself a few days later that
the oxygen was probably getting low in that tank
and that he would need another soon. He decided to
put a new one in ahead of time to forestall the possibility
of running completely out in the air.
He brought a new tank out and decided to test it
before he put it in the ship. He opened the valve and
nothing happened. The tank was empty.
He took it back to the hangar and discovered that
the previous tank my friend had been flying on had
come out of the same bin and had been empty all
along.
He got a good one and put it in the ship and
didn’t say anything about the incident. My friend
said that the next time he took a whiff of oxygen it
almost knocked him out of his seat.



I SPIN IN
I had been spin testing a Mercury Chic for several
weeks, doing everything at a safe and sane altitude,
being very scientific. I finally spun it in from an altitude
of about three feet. And I mean spun it in too.
The ship was a complete washout.
There was a strong wind that day, and a very
gusty one. When I taxied out for the take-off the
wind was on my tail. There were no brakes on the
ship. It was very light, and in addition, a high wing
job—always a top-heavy thing in a wind.
The wind kept swinging me around into it, and I
wanted to go the other way. I should have called a
couple of mechanics from the line to come and hold
my wings and help me taxi. But I was proud or stubborn
or dumb or something that day.
I adopted a little strategy. I’d get the ship all
lined up down wind and when the wind would start
swinging me around the other way I’d just let it
swing until the nose was headed almost into the wind.
Then I would gun it, kick rudder with the swing,
thus aggravating it instead of checking it, hoping
to get my way by going with it instead of fighting
it, and then, when it was headed down wind again,
try to hold it there until the next gust started swinging
me around again.
It worked fine, and I was making a certain amount
of headway down the field until, on one of the swings,
a particularly heavy gust of wind picked up my
outside wing as I was swinging. The ship tipped up
very slowly, and I thought I was going to tip a wing.
Then a larger and heavier gust hit it. It picked that
ship off the ground, turned it over on its back and
literally threw it down on the ground.
It was the worst crack-up I had ever been in. All
four longerons were broken, the wings crumpled, the
motor mount was twisted, the prop bent, the tail
crushed, and the ship looked like it had spun in from
at least ten thousand feet.
I crawled out from under it unhurt except for my
feelings. I never felt so foolish in my life. I had
cracked up a ship without even flying it.



BUSINESS BEFORE FAME
Clyde Pangborne, of Pangborne and Herndon
fame, the two flyers who were first to fly non-stop
from Japan to America over the Pacific Ocean, and
also of Pangborne and Turner fame, the flying team
that won third place in the London-Australia Air
Derby in 1934, was operations manager for the
famous Gate’s Flying Circus for many years. He
flew into Lewiston, Mont., in October, 1923, with his
aërial circus. He had a contract with the fair association
of that town, giving him exclusive rights to all
the passenger carrying and flying to be done at the
local fair then in progress.
He landed an hour before he was supposed to put
on his first performance of stunting, wing-walking
and parachute jumping, the preliminary crowd-attracting
procedure before the money-making of
passenger carrying, which was one of the attractions
the fair had advertised. He found another pilot and
plane, with chute jumper, there ahead of him, all set
to do business in his place.
Pangborne told the other pilot to get out. The
other pilot said, “So what?” Pangborne said: “I got
a contract, and I’m going to town to see about it.”
He went to town and told the fair association
about it. He said he would sue the city if they didn’t
get that other guy and his chute jumper off the
field by the time he was ready to put on his exhibition.
The fair association went out to the field. They
got hold of the other pilot and his chute jumper.
They reminded the pilot that he had flown out of
that field the previous year, and, in departing, had
overlooked the small matter of paying a certain
amount of rent he had agreed to pay for the field.
They told him to get out or go to jail by four o’clock
that afternoon.
It was a conclusive argument. The pilot cranked
his ship, got in his cockpit, called to his chute
jumper, a long, slim, gangling kid who was obviously
disappointed at the turn affairs had taken, because
he had been all set to have some fun jumping that
day, and took off.
The chute jumper was Charles Augustus Lindbergh,
who had not yet learned to fly.



EVERYTHING WRONG
On my first solo in a Martin bomber, I started to
take off and started swinging to the left. I put on
right rudder but kept on swinging to the left. I ran
out of right rudder and was still swinging to the left
into a line of mesquite trees. I eased the right motor
off a little, but it didn’t help much. I couldn’t cut the
gun and stop before I hit the trees. I could only
hope to get into the air before I got up to them.
Suddenly my left wing started to lift, and it
dawned on me like a flash of shame what was wrong.
I had had the wheel rolled to the right and my left
aileron down. The resistance of that down aileron
had swung me to the left at slow speeds, and I had
fought it with right rudder, but now at high speeds
it was banking me to the right, and I still had on
right rudder. I was taking off in a right-hand bank
with the controls set fully for it. The left-hand
motor was pulling stronger than the right.
I never kicked and pulled so many things so fast
before as I did right then. By some miracle I found
myself fifty feet in the air instead of in a heap. But
I was flying exactly at right angles to the direction
I had originally planned.
Everything seemed to be all right, so I went
around and landed. I gave it the gun immediately
on touching the ground and went around and landed
again.
This time I saw a lot of cars coming out toward
me. Maybe that take-off had looked pretty good.
Maybe they thought I knew what I had been doing.
The two landings had been good. Maybe they were
coming out to congratulate me.
My instructor got there first. He ran over and
started inspecting the right wing tip. He was looking
underneath it. “Hey, you,” he shouted at me
when he looked up, “don’t you ever get out and take
a look after you crack up a ship?”
I had dragged the right wing for several hundred
feet. The under side of the wing was badly torn up,
and the aileron was just barely hanging on.



A SHOWY STUNT
An upside-down landing is one of the showiest
maneuvers a stunting pilot can perform. He doesn’t
really land upside down. He comes all the way in in
his glide upside down until he is about ten or twenty
feet off the ground. Then he rolls over and lands
right side up.
Jack, who had got pretty hot at this maneuver,
hit a telephone pole coming in like that one day and
woke up in the hospital.
Some time before that I had almost done practically
the same thing. I had dived low over the field
down wind at the end of a show I had been putting
on at a little air meet and had pulled up until I was
on my back at about eight hundred feet. I decided I
would not only glide in upside down but would make
it really fancy and slip both ways in the glide. I
started to slip but forgot and did it the same as I
would have had I been right side up and produced
a bank instead. No, no, I told myself, coördinate,
don’t cross controls. There. I tried one to the other
side. That’s fine, I told myself. I got so absorbed
in this little maneuver that I completely forgot the
ground until I was almost too low and too slow to
turn right side up again. I actually missed the
ground by inches as I rolled over, and only some
kind fate presiding over absent-minded stunt pilots
enabled me to do it then.
I saw Jack in the hospital, when he was well
enough.
“Hey, Jack,” I started kidding him, “I hear that
you practiced upside-down landings for months, and
that finally you made one. Is there any truth to
that?”
He clamped his jaws but grinned back at me.
“That’s all right,” he said, “but if I remember correctly
I saw a pilot by the name of Jimmy Collins
just miss landing upside down once.”
“Yeah, Jack,” I said, “but—” I hesitated: this
was too good not to emphasize—“but I missed,” I
said.
Jack just glared at me. There wasn’t any answer.



DEATH ON THE GRIDIRON
It’s funny how things turn out sometimes. Fate
gives you a capricious little tweak, and there you
are. I often think of the case of Zep Schock.
Zep and I were fraternity brothers at college. I
was crazy about aviation, and Zep was crazy about
football. I had been too poor to fly up till then, and
Zep had been too little to play football. He weighed
only about ninety-five pounds when he came to college.
They had even used him as a sort of a mascot
on the high-school teams.
Near the end of my freshman year I discovered
quite accidentally, through reading an aviation
magazine which I had repeatedly promised myself
not to read because it took my mind off my work,
that the army would teach me to fly for nothing.
They would even pay me for it! And Zep suddenly
started to grow.
I passed my entrance examinations for the Army
Primary Flying School at Brooks Field, San
Antonio, Tex., that fall, and prepared to quit school
after the mid-term exams—which would mark the
end of my freshman year, because I had started
college in January instead of March—to go to flying
school the following March. Zep had made the
freshman football team in the meantime.
There wasn’t much flying outside of the army in
those days, and nobody knew much about it except
that it was dangerous. None of the fellows could understand
why I was doing such a fool thing. They
tried to talk me out of it, discovered they couldn’t,
decided I was nuts, and started kidding me. Zep was
the best of the bunch.
Every night at dinner he used to propose a toast
to me. “Here’s to Jimmy Collins,” he used to say.
“The average life of the aviator is forty hours.” He
had picked those figures up some place reading about
war pilots.
That was eleven years ago, and I’m still flying.
Poor Zep made the regular team the next year and
got killed playing football.



NOVICE NEAR DEATH
One flight test I gave, when I was an inspector
for the Department of Commerce, was almost my
last.
I went up with a guy, saw in three minutes he
couldn’t fly, took the controls away from him,
landed, and told him to come back some other day.
He pleaded with me that I hadn’t given him a chance,
that if I would only let him go further through the
test without taking the controls away he would show
me he could fly.
So I took him up again. I let him slop along without
interference until we came to spins. I told him
to do a spin, and he started a steep spiral. I took the
controls away from him, regained some altitude, told
him to do a spin again, and he started a steep spiral
again—a lousy spiral, too!
I thought maybe he was afraid to do a spin, so I
said the mental equivalent of “Skip it” to myself
and told him to do a three-sixty. He should have
gone to fifteen hundred feet, cut the gun, turned
around once in his glide and landed on a spot under
where he had cut the gun. He went to two thousand
feet instead, put the ship in a steep, skidding spiral
verging on a spin—he was death on steep spirals—and
held it there. Round and round we went. I let
him go. I wanted to convince him this time.
I had been watching for it, but at two hundred
feet the ship beat me to it even so and flipped right
over on its back. I made one swift movement, knocking
the throttle open with my left hand in passing,
and grabbed the stick with both hands. The guy was
frantically freezing backward on it, but my sudden,
violent attack on it gave me the lead on him and I
managed to get the stick just far enough forward
to stop the spin we had begun. I was sure we were
going to hit the ground swooping out of the resultant
dive, but by some miracle we missed it.
I landed immediately and was so mad I started to
walk off without saying anything. But the guy followed
me, bleating, “Please, Mr. Collins. Please, Mr.
Collins,” until I relented and turned to speak.
Before I could say anything he broke in on me
with: “Please, Mr. Collins, please don’t grab the
controls from me like that just because I make one
too many turns. I could bring the ship down all
right.”
My mouth opened and closed speechlessly. Bring
it down! Bring us both down in a heap! But how
could I say it and make myself understood? The guy
didn’t even know we had been in a spin. He didn’t
know we had almost broken our necks in one. He
thought I was impatient!



HUNGRY’S SHIP BURNED
Lieutenant Hungry Gates’ ship caught fire in the
air. He pulled his throttle and worked carefully but
fast. He undid his belt and started to raise himself
out of the cockpit. He started to leap but remembered
something. That swell bottle of pre-war liquor
that a friend had given him just before he took off
was in the map case. He’d need that if he got down
alive. He made a quick grab back into the cockpit
for it and leaped head foremost, clear of the burning
wreck.
He missed the tail surfaces and waited a moment,
thankful for that much. He didn’t want the ship to
fall on him. He didn’t want any of the burning
débris to fall on his chute when he opened it.
When he had waited long enough, he started to
pull his rip cord to open his chute, but discovered
both hands already engaged. He let go of the bottle
of liquor with his right hand and hugged the bottle
tightly with his left arm. He grabbed his rip-cord
ring with his freed right hand, yanked hard, grabbed
his bottle to him with both hands again, and waited.
The sudden checking of his speed when his chute
opened jolted him up short in his harness, but he
didn’t drop the bottle.
He thought of the flaming wreck above him. He
looked up but saw only his white chute spread safely
above him, etched cold against the clear blue sky. He
looked around the sky. He saw a long trailing column
of black smoke and followed it with his eyes downward
until he saw the hurtling ship at the end of it.
It was beneath him now and no longer a threat to his
chute. He watched it nose violently into a wooded
patch off to his left just before he settled down into
a pasture. He hit hard, fell down, but held on to his
bottle. His chute toppled over into a limp heap in
the still air.
He sat up and decided he needed a drink before
he even got out of his harness to gather up his chute.
He hauled his bottle out from under his arm and
gazed at it in consternation, licking his lips.
It wasn’t a bottle at all. It was the fire extinguisher!



BACK-SEAT PALS
Back-seat driving is taboo in the ethics of the flying
game. But occasionally you get a case of it when
you get two pilots together in the same cockpit.
Two pilots were flying a pretty heavily loaded
bomber on a cross-country trip, one time. They were
both fast friends and both equally good pilots.
Maybe that’s why the thing happened as it did.
They landed at Love Field, Tex., gassed up, and
taxied out to take off again. Part of the field was
torn up. They didn’t have any more field than just
enough from where they began their take-off.
Their heavily loaded ship with its two Liberty
motors, its acres of wings, and its forest of struts
started lumbering down the field. The pilot who was
flying the ship used most of the space in front of
his obstacles before he got the ship off the ground.
He did a nice job after he got it off the ground by
not climbing it more than just enough to clear the
wires which were in front of him. He figured he was
just going to clear them nicely when apparently the
other pilot, sitting alongside him in the other cockpit,
figured he wasn’t although why the other pilot
did what he did at that second I could never figure
out, except that it was one of those dumb things that
we are all apt to do under duress if we don’t watch
ourselves.
Anyway, both motors suddenly quit cold, and the
ship smacked into the wires and piled up in a heap
on the far side of the road across the airport.
Both pilots came out of the wreck running. The
one who had been flying the ship had the wheel,
which evidently had broken off in the crash, raised
above his head in his right hand. He was brandishing
it wildly, running after the other pilot and shouting
at the top of his voice, “Cut my switches, will you!
Cut my switches just when I was going to make it!
If I ever catch you I’ll cut your throat!”



WATCH YOUR STEP!
At Anacostia Naval Air Station, the river flows on
one side of the hangars, and the airport stretches
on the other. They fly boats out of the river side
and land planes out of the airport side.
One pilot down there had been flying land planes
exclusively for several months. Then one day he flew
a boat. One of the enlisted pilots went along with
him as co-pilot.
After flying around for a while he started in for
a landing. But instead of coming in for a landing
on the river he started to land on the airport.
The enlisted pilot with him let him go as long as
he thought he dared. Then he nudged him in the
ribs, pointed out that he was about to land a boat on
land, and suggested that maybe it would be a better
idea to go over and land in the river.
The pilot agreed that it certainly would. He gave
it the gun and went around again and came in for
a landing on the river. He made a good landing and
let the ship slow down. When they were idling along
he turned around to the enlisted pilot and started to
apologize for almost landing him on land. He undid
his belt as he talked.
“That was a dumb thing for me to do,” he said.
“I’ve been flying land planes for so long that I guess
I just started coming in there from habit without
thinking. It sure was dumb.” He was obviously
humiliated and confused.
“Well,” he said finally, “it sure was dumb,” and
got up and climbed out of the cockpit onto the wing.
“So long,” he said, and stepped down off the wing
into the water.



FLYER ENJOYS WORRY
Gloomy Gus got his name at Brooks Field, the army
primary flying school. He was always going to get
washed out of the school the next day. When he
graduated from Brooks he wasn’t going to last three
weeks at Kelly, the advanced school, because he had
got through Brooks by luck anyway. When he
graduated from Kelly, the hottest pilot in his class, he
would never get a job in commercial flying, so he
might just as well have been washed out at Kelly.
I saw him several months later in Chicago. He was
flying one of the best runs on the western division
of the mail. He was sure it wouldn’t be very long
before he cracked up, night flying, and disabled himself
for life, so what good was his mail job?
I saw him several years after he had been transferred
to the eastern run over the Allegheny Mountains.
He didn’t know what good the additional
money he was making was going to do him when he
was dead. Didn’t all the hot pilots get it in those
mountains?
He took a vacation from the passenger lines and
went on active duty with the army. I saw him at
Mitchell Field. He said he was taking his vacation
flying because he wanted to fly some army ships for
a change and have some fun. “But you know, I
shouldn’t have done it,” he said. “I’ve been flying
straight and level too long. I almost hit a guy in
formation this morning. I probably won’t live long
enough to get back to the lines.”
I saw him a few days after he had gone back to
the lines.
“How they going, Gloomy?” I greeted him.
“Oh,” he said, “that bit of army flying made me
careless. I almost hit a radio tower this morning.
Carelessness is what kills all old-timers, you know.”
“Gus,” I said. “You’d be miserable if you didn’t
have something to worry about. You will probably
live to have a long white beard and worry yourself
sick all day long that you are going to trip on it
and break your neck.”
Only a faint flicker of humor lit up his gloomy
eyes.



WEATHER AND WHITHER
Archer Winsten writes that “different” column in
the Post, In the Wake of the News. I met Archer
for the first time in San Antonio in 1927. He was
down there for his health, and I was instructing at
Brooks Field for my living. We both had ideas of
writing even at that time. We became fast friends
before Archer went home to Connecticut and I went
to March Field, Riverside, Cal.
I resigned from the army the next year and went
with the Department of Commerce. I was assigned
to fly Bill McCracken, head of the department, on
about a seven-thousand-mile tour of the country. I
kept asking Bill if his itinerary was going to take
us to Westport, Conn., or anywhere near it, because
if it was I wanted to go see my friend Archer Winsten,
who lived there. He said he didn’t know where
the place was, and I began looking for it on the map.
I couldn’t find it and told Bill that. I remarked how
strange it was several times later that I couldn’t find
Westport on the map. A couple of times Bill asked
me if I had found it yet, and I said no.
I was strange to the East at that time, and when
we got to Hartford I was sure we were going to go
right past Westport without my ever finding out
where it was. I complained to Bill about it and we
both looked over a map and couldn’t find the place.
The next day we started down to New York from
Hartford and ran into lousy weather. It got so low
finally that, although I was following railroads and
valleys, I decided that I couldn’t go any farther. I
milled around, dodging trees and hills for about ten
minutes before I found a place to sit down.
I landed in a small field surrounded with stone
fences. A man came wading through the wet grass
toward us after we had stopped rolling. Bill asked
me where we were, and I said I had only a vague
idea after all that milling around but would ask the
man. The man said Westport.
Bill howled with delight. Part of his delight undoubtedly
was relief at getting down out of that
soup without breaking his neck, but I was never able
to convince him that I didn’t know I was landing at
Westport.



I SEE
A man came up to me for flight test once when I
was an inspector for the Department of Commerce.
He flew terribly, so I sent him away and told him to
come back in a couple of weeks, after he had practiced
a little more. He came back a couple of weeks
later, and I turned him down again.
The third time he came in he said, “I think we’ll
get along all right this time. Can I take the test
today?”
“I’m too busy today,” I told him. But he pleaded
so hard that I finally said, “All right, I’ll squeeze
you in this afternoon. Come at three o’clock.”
“Thank you, thank you,” he said, and held out his
hand.
I reached out my hand to grip his and felt something
in my palm. I pulled my hand away and found
a piece of paper in it. I unfolded it and discovered
a ten-dollar bill.
I stood there and looked at it, puzzled and amazed
for a few seconds. Then the full import of it dawned
on me. He thought I had been holding out for something.
He thought he would fix me up. He didn’t
know he could never fix me up if I put my stamp of
approval on him when he was unfit and he should
then go out and kill some passenger because of my
leniency.
It started at the top of my head, that raging
anger. It burned like flaming coals and raced
through my veins like fire. I began to tremble violently,
and when I looked up the man was a red flame
in a red room.
I hurled the paper bill at him as though it were a
javelin and shouted, “Get out! Get out and don’t
ever come back!”
Have you ever thrown a piece of paper at anybody?
The bill fluttered ineffectually down to the floor
halfway between us. I rushed at it and kicked at it
until it was out of the door. I kicked him out too.
I wondered, sitting at my desk afterward, why I
had got so mad. It wasn’t honesty. I hadn’t had time
to think of honesty. I wondered if it was because he
had implied that I was worth ten dollars. I wondered
what I would have done if he had offered me ten
thousand dollars. I began to understand graft.



WON ARGUMENT LOST
“That student is dangerous. You’re crazy if you
fly with him again,” I harangued my friend, Brooks
Wilson.
“Don’t be that way,” Brooks answered. “He’s not
dangerous. He’s goofy.”
“That’s why he’s dangerous,” I countered. “You
tell me that he froze the controls in a panic today
and you lost a thousand feet of altitude before you
were able to get the ship away from him. The next
time you may not have a thousand feet.”
“I won’t need a thousand feet the next time,”
Brooks argued. “I wrestled the controls away from
him today, but the next time he grabs them like that,
I’ll just beat him over the head with the fire extinguisher
and knock him out.”
“If you are high enough to do that, you won’t
be in any danger,” I pointed out. “And if you are
low enough to be in danger when he freezes, you
won’t have time to knock him out.”
Brooks and I were both very young army instructors,
and Brooks was stubborn with the confidence
of youth. He only growled, “Don’t be a sissy
all your life. I can handle this guy.”
The next day a solo student spun in, in a field of
corn beside the airport. Brooks had just landed with
his goofy student and was crawling out of his cockpit
when he saw the ship hit. He jumped back into
his cockpit, gave his still idling motor the gun and
took off, his goofy student still in the rear seat.
He flew over the wreck, circled it, dove on it,
pulled up, wing-it, dove on it, pulled up, wing-overed,
and dove on it again. He was a beautiful
pilot. He was pointing out to the ambulance where
the wreck was in the tall corn. He pulled up and
started another wing-over, flipped suddenly over on
his back, and spun in right beside the wreck.
When they pulled Brooks out of his wreck he was
unconscious but was muttering over and over again
in his Southern vernacular, “Turn ’em loose. Turn
’em loose. Turn ’em loose before we crash.”
The goofy student was hardly even scratched.
Brooks died that night.



MONK HUNTER
Monk Hunter was a dashing aviator, the only really
dashing aviator I have ever known. There was dash
to the cut and fit of his uniforms, dash to the shine
and the fit of his boots, dash to the twirl and flip
of the cane he carried. There was dash to the set
of his magnificently erect and darkly handsome head,
dash in the flare of his nostrils and the gleam of his
flashing black eyes, dash in his violently dynamic
gestures and in his torrential, staccatoed, highly
inflected speech which he aimed at you as he had aimed
machine guns at enemy flyers during the war when he
had shot down nine of them.
There was especial dash to Monk’s mustache. Only
Monk could have worn that mustache. I saw him
once without it, and something seemed to have gone
out of him as it went out of Samson when they
clipped his hair. He looked naked and helpless.
It was a big mustache, the kind you see in tintypes
of swains of long ago. It bristled, and Monk had a
way about him in twirling it that you should have
seen.
Poor Monk took off at Selfridge one day in an
army pursuit ship. He even did that with dash. He
held it low after the take-off and then started a
clean, left, sweeping climb into the blue sky.
We all saw the white smoke start trailing out
behind his ship. Then with bated breath we watched
the ship slump slowly over from its gestured climbing
and nose straight down inexorably toward the
ice of Lake St. Clair. Monk’s chute blossomed out
behind the diving ship just before it disappeared
behind the trees.
We all jumped into cars and rushed madly over
to where we thought it had hit. We found Monk,
unhurt, except for the jar from landing on the ice,
waving his arms, wildly shouting that the ship had
caught fire and to look what the damned thing had
done. We looked at the ship, but Monk was still
gesticulating excitedly, so we looked at him. He
meant to look what it had done to him.
We all started laughing like hell. We were really
laughing with Monk, not at him. He appreciated
it, too.
His mustache had been burnt clear off on one side.



COULDN’T TAKE IT
I was testing an airplane one day. Its wings came
off, and I jumped out in my chute. I am convinced
that the people on the ground watching me got a
bigger thrill out of it than I did. I was too busy.
For one thing, Admiral Moffett, who was later
killed in the Akron, rushed home to his office in an
emotional fit and wrote me a very nice letter about
what a hero I was. I wasn’t any hero. I had just
been saving my neck.
And for another, my mechanic came up to see me
in the hospital right afterward. I wasn’t in the
hospital because I was hurt, but because the military
doctor on the post made me go there. After I
had got into the hospital I discovered that my heart
was beating so violently that I couldn’t sleep, so
when Eddie, my mechanic, came up they let him in.
He didn’t say anything at all for a while. He just
sat on the bed opposite mine and twirled his cap,
looking down at the floor. Finally he said, “When
your chute opened, I fell down.”
I pictured him running madly across the field,
watching me falling before I had opened my chute,
and then stumbling just as my chute opened. “Why
didn’t you watch where you were going?” I said
banteringly.
He kept looking at the floor, twirling his cap, his
face expressionless. “I wasn’t going any place,” he
said.
The conversation wasn’t making much sense to me.
“Didn’t you say that when my chute opened, you
fell down?” I asked.
“Yes,” he said, as if he were talking to the floor.
He was in a sort of trance.
“Well,” I said, puzzled, “then you must have been
running across the field watching me. You must have
stumbled and fallen.”
“No,” he said, like a man in a dream, “I didn’t
stumble on anything. I was just standing there looking
up, watching you.”
I was getting frantic. “Well, how in the hell did
you fall down, then?” I asked.
“My knees collapsed,” he said.



GOOD LUCK
Soon now, he would be flying out over the ocean.
Soon he would be famous and rich. Lindbergh had
made it. Why shouldn’t he?
His ship was almost ready. Its belly bulged with
new tanks. Its wings stretched with new width to take
the added gas load. Its motor emitted a perfect
sound that his trained ears could find no fault with.
Only the final adjusting of his instruments remained.
Lindbergh had taken great pains with his
instruments. He would too. When the ground crew
had finished with them, he flew his ship on a short
cross-country trip to check the instruments in flight.
They worked fine.
He brought his ship down to put it in the hangar
until he got his break in weather. He lingered in the
cockpit for a few moments, contemplating his instruments
in anticipation of the weary hours he would
have to watch them during the long flight.
A thought occurred to him. Lindbergh had been
lucky. He would be too. His girl (sweet kid—maybe
when he came back ... but he would do the job
first) had already wished him luck. She had given
him a token of her wish. It was only a cheap thing
she had picked up in some novelty shop, but he
treasured it. He took it out of his pocket. He tied it
to the instrument board and fashioned its bright
red ribbon into a neat bow knot that reminded him
of the way she fastened her apron when she made
coffee for him in her kitchen late at night. There.
Yes, he too would have luck now.
Several days later his break in the weather hadn’t
come yet. He got worried about his instruments.
There were no landmarks in the ocean. Maybe he had
better check his compass again.
He went out to the field and flew his ship. The
compass was off! It was way off! When the ground
crew checked it again it was off twenty degrees on
the first reading.
They soon found the trouble. As everybody knows,
metal near a compass will throw it off. They found
a metal imitation of a rabbit’s foot suspended on a
red ribbon tied to the bottom of the compass case.



WILL ROGERS IN THE AIR
I was flying as a passenger on one of the airlines
once, going out to Wichita to take delivery of a ship
I had sold. Will Rogers was a passenger on the same
ship.
When we stopped at Columbus, I managed to engage
Rogers in conversation. I had always been
curious about whether he talked in private life as he
does on the stage and radio, and if the poor grammar
in his writing was deliberate or natural. He talked
to me exactly as he does on the stage and radio, and
his grammar was just as bad as it is in his writing.
So I decided that, if it was an act, he was carrying
it pretty far.
I noticed that he made certain movements with
difficulty. He seemed to be crippled up a little. I
asked him what was the matter. He said he had fallen
off his horse before he left California and had broken
a couple of ribs. I thought that was kind of funny,
because I had always supposed he was a good horseman.
I told him that, and he said it was a new horse
and he wasn’t used to it. I still thought it was kind
of funny, but I let it pass.
I managed to bring out a little later in the conversation
that I was a professional pilot myself and
that being a passenger was a rare experience for
me. He said he could tell me the truth then. He said
he really had had an airplane accident the day before.
An airliner he had been riding in had made
a forced landing, had nosed over pretty hard, and
had banged him up a little. That’s how he had
broken his ribs.
He said it hadn’t been the pilot’s fault that they
had cracked up, that the motor had quit, and that
the pilot had done a good job considering the country
he had to sit down in. He said that only a good
pilot could have kept from killing everybody in the
ship, and that he was the only one who had been
hurt.
He said he had told me that story about the horse
in the first place because he thought I was a regular
passenger. He said not to tell any of the rest of the
passengers, because it might scare them and spoil
their trip.



HE NEVER KNEW
Pilots often play jokes on each other when they
fly together.
Two pilots I knew at Kelly Field had been up to
Dallas on a week-end cross-country trip. They
started back on a very rough day and were bouncing
all around the sky.
About fifty miles out of San Antonio, the pilot
who was flying the ship turned around to ask the
other one in the rear seat for some matches. He
couldn’t see him, so he figured he was slumped down
in the cockpit, napping. He looked back under his
arm inside the fuselage. The rear cockpit was empty!
He was only flying at about five hundred feet,
hadn’t been flying any higher than that on the whole
trip, and at times had been flying even lower.
Scared to death that his passenger had loosened
his belt to stretch out and sleep and had been thrown
out of the cockpit in a bump, perhaps even failing
to recognize his predicament in time to open his
chute, the pilot swung back on his course and started
searching the route he had covered for signs of a
body. He searched back over as much of it as he
dared and still have enough gas left to turn around
again and go on into Kelly Field.
He found nothing and was worried sick all the
way back to Kelly. But when he landed, there was
the other pilot, grinning a greeting at him.
The pilot who had been in the rear seat explained
that he had undone his belt to stretch out and sleep
and that the next thing he knew he felt a bump and
woke up with a start to discover the cockpit about
four feet beneath him and off to one side. He said he
reached, but only grabbed thin air. The tail surfaces
passed by under him, and he saw the airplane
flying off without him.
He was too astounded at first, but quickly realized
he ought to do something, sitting out there in space
with no airplane or anything, so he pulled his rip
cord. His chute opened just in time.
He walked over to the main road he had been
flying over so recently and thumbed himself a ride to
Kelly Field. He said he had seen the ship turn
around and start back looking for him.
The pilot who had been flying the ship never knew
if the other one had really fallen out of the ship, or
if he had jumped out as a joke.



BONNY’S DREAM
Bonny had a dream. His inventor’s eyes gleamed
with the light of it. His days lived with the hope of
it. His nights moved with its vision.
Because of his dream we called him Bonny Gull.
He dreamed of building an airplane with metal, wood
and fabric to emulate the sinewed, feathered grace of
a soaring gull.
He studied gulls. He studied them dead and alive.
He studied their wonderful soaring flight alive. He
killed them and studied their lifeless wings. He
wanted their secret. He wanted to recreate it for
man.
He might have asked God. He might have asked
God and heard a still small voice answer: “Render
unto Cæsar what is Cæsar’s and unto God what
is God’s. Render unto man his own flight and leave
to the gulls their own. Man’s flight is different because
his destiny is different. He doesn’t need the
gulls’ flight.”
But Bonny envied the gulls. He killed hundreds
of them, yes, thousands, and buried them in the
field. He built an airplane from what he thought
he had learned from their dead bodies.
He built an airplane and took it out to fly. Engineers,
who had never studied gulls but who had
studied man’s flight, told him he shouldn’t do it.
They pointed out to him how the center of pressure
would shift on his wings. But Bonny glared his glittering
faith at them, snuggled his dream in close,
and flew.
He took off all right. He roared across the field,
and if he didn’t sound quite like a gull, he looked the
part. He rose into the air for all the world like a
giant gull. He pulled off in a steep climb, and the
wise men wondered if again they were proved wrong
by an ignorant fanatic.
Their wonder didn’t last long. When Bonny tried
to level out, he nosed over and dove straight into the
ground, like a gull diving into the ocean for a fish.
We rushed out to the wreck. Bonny was quite
dead. There was scattered around him not only the
remains of his own gull wings, but thousands of the
feathered remains of other gull wings. He had dived
straight into the shallow grave of all the gulls he
had killed.



COB-PIPE HAZARDS
Silly little things are apt to crack you up sometimes.
I did an outside loop at Akron once. I came up
over the top of the loop and started right down
into another. I didn’t want to do another, so I pulled
back on the stick to stop it. It wouldn’t come all the
way back. It was jammed some way.
The ship was nosing steeper and steeper into the
dive. I rolled the stabilizer, and that enabled me to
pull the nose up. I couldn’t keep it up if I cut the
gun more than halfway. I knew I would have a tough
time landing like that. Besides, although I had a
chute, I knew that when I got down low to make a
landing the stick might jam even farther forward
and nose me in before I had a chance to jump. Or
the engine might quit down low and do the same
thing. It wasn’t my ship, however, and I didn’t want
to jump and throw it away if I didn’t absolutely
have to.
I tried the stick a few more times. Each time I
yanked it back hard it came up against the same
obstacle at the same point. I decided to take a chance
that it would stay jammed where it was.
I came in low ’way back of the field with almost
all of the back travel of the stick taken up, holding
the nose up with the gun. I had to land with the tail
up high, going fast. I bounced wildly, used all the
field, but made it all right.
I made an immediate inspection to find out what
had jammed the stick. I couldn’t imagine what it was
because I had taken all the loose gadgets out of the
ship before I had gone up.
I found a corncob pipe that the ship’s owner had
been looking for for weeks. He had left it in the
baggage compartment and had never been able to
find it. It had slipped through a small opening at
the top of the rear wall of the compartment and had
evidently been floating around in the tail of the
fuselage all that time.
When I did the outside loop it had been flung
upward by centrifugal force and wedged into the
wedge ending of the upper longerons at the end of
the fuselage. The flipper horn was hitting it every
time I pulled the stick back, preventing me from
getting the full backward movement.
Only the bowl of the pipe was left. It was lodged
sidewise. Had it lodged endwise it would have jammed
the stick even farther forward, and I would have had
to jump or dive in with the ship. I would have had
to jump quickly, too, because I didn’t have much
altitude when I started that second involuntary outside
loop.



WHOOPEE!
A friend of mine was once chased and rammed in
midair by a drunken pilot. If you have ever been
approached on the road by a drunken driver you
have some idea of the predicament he found himself
in when this drunk started chasing him. Of course,
he didn’t know this guy was drunk, but he knew he
was either drunk or crazy.
My friend was an army pilot. He was flying an
army pursuit ship from Selfridge Field, Mich.,
to Chicago and was circling the field at Chicago
preparatory to landing when he was set upon by the
drunk, who, evidently still living in the memory of
his war days, was trying to egg my friend on to a
sham battle, trying to get him to dogfight.
He saw the DH, which was a mail ship of those
days, approach him first from above and head on.
He had to kick out of the way at the last moment,
or he would have been hit on that first pass the guy
took at him. The guy pulled up and took another
pass at him. He kicked out of the way again and
started wondering since when had they turned lunatics
loose in the sky. He didn’t have much time for
wondering, because the guy kept taking passes at
him. Finally, the guy took to diving down under him
and pulling up in front of him. He seemed to think
that was more fun than just diving on my friend,
and he kept it up.
My friend saw him disappear under the tail of his
ship this time, and he didn’t know what to do about
it. He didn’t know which way to turn, because he
didn’t know which way the goof was going to pull up.
Suddenly he saw the nose of the other ship. It
came up directly in front of his own nose. He knew
the guy had overdone it this time and come too close.
He pulled back on his stick, but felt the jar of the
collision just as he did. It threw him up into a stall,
and when he came out his motor was so rough he had
to cut his switches. He had raked the tail of the
other ship with his propeller, and it was bent all out
of shape. He had also cut the tail off the drunk’s
ship.
The drunk was evidently too drunk to get out of
the cockpit because he cracked up with his ship. My
friend managed to get his ship down without jumping.
It was only a wonder, plus some neat flying on
my friend’s part, that he wasn’t killed too.



BUILDING THROUGH
A pilot should never be too stubborn with an airplane.
I learned that early, fortunately, without
coming to grief in the process.
Another pilot criticized my flying once. He criticized
the way I was making my take-offs. Kidlike
and cocky, just out of flying school, I took a foolish
way of proving he was wrong. But he had me so
riled by his caustic and nasty remarks about how I
was going to kill myself if I kept that up that I
flung out a challenge to him and felt I had to keep
my attitude even when I saw I was overdoing the
thing and thought I was going to crack up.
“If you think my take-offs are so dangerous,” I
told him, “I’ll just go out there and cut my gun in
the most dangerous spot of this dangerous take-off
and land safely back in the airport.” And I stalked
out, fuming, and got in the ship.
I took off toward the high trees at the end of the
field, didn’t let the ship climb very steeply approaching
the trees, and banked just before I got to them—exactly
like I had been doing on the take-offs he
had been criticizing. But I also pulled up sharply,
just to make it worse. I didn’t want him to have any
comeback. I cut the gun and started dropping back
in over the trees into the airport. I should have put
the nose down a little to cushion the drop, but I was
mad. I’d show him the worse way. I wanted to gun
it because I was dropping hard, but I wouldn’t give
him the satisfaction.
I hit like a ton of bricks. The ship groaned and
bounced as high as a hangar. Luckily, it was a square
hit and a square bounce. That’s the only reason I
didn’t spread the ship all over the field. It hit and
bounced again and rolled to a very short stop for a
down-wind landing.
“All right,” I told the guy when I crawled out
of the ship, “you go out now and cut your gun just
over the trees on one of your safe, straight take-offs.
You won’t have a turn started and already pretty
well developed, and you won’t have room enough to
start one. You’ll pile into the trees in a heap, and if
that’s safer than landing on the airport in one piece,
then I’ll admit that your take-offs are safer than
mine.”
He didn’t dare and he knew it. So he just glared
at me, knowing damned well, as I knew myself, that
I should by all rights have cracked up on that landing.
But I had him, and he shut up and didn’t make
any more cracks about me.



MUCH!
Somebody asked me one day what kind of an airplane
I flew. I told him any kind anybody was willing
to pay me for flying.
“But don’t you own an airplane?” the man asked.
“No,” I answered. “And furthermore,” I added,
“I have never owned an airplane, although I have
been a professional pilot for eleven years.”
Why?
Well, I can best explain that as I explained it to
a little boy once out in California.
I was at the Lockheed factory. I had been there
several months, supervising the construction of an
airplane I had sold to a rich sportsman pilot in the
East. It was a Lockheed Sirius plane and at that
time a ship which was taking everybody’s eyes as the
latest and sleekest thing yet developed by the engineers.
Lindbergh had just popularized it by flying
himself and his wife across the country in it and
establishing a new transcontinental record.
They rolled my ship out on the line one bright,
sunny day and I must say that in its shiny new red-and-white
paint job and its clean, sweeping lines it
certainly was a beautiful sight sitting there glistening
in that California sunshine.
A little boy who had crawled over the factory
fence despite the “No Trespassing” sign evidently
thought so too, for he was standing there gazing
raptly at it with eyes as big as silver dollars when
I stalked out toward the ship to make a first test hop
in it. He intercepted me neatly as I rounded the wing
tip and approached the cockpit.
“Ooh, mister,” he said, “do you own that ship?”
“No, sonny,” I answered. “I merely fly it. I find
that that is less expensive and more fun.”



CROSS-COUNTRY SNAPSHOTS
I take off from March Field, Calif., head north
and climb steeply. At ten thousand feet on the altimeter
I see the green fir trees skimming only a couple
of hundred feet beneath me. I see the deep snow between
their trunks, brilliant in the sun. I am clearing
the San Bernardino range.
I come out at ten thousand feet over the Mohave
Desert, my altimeter still reading ten thousand feet.
The floor of the Mohave is high.
I look ahead to the railroad, thirty miles away. I
look behind. The green-sloped, snow-capped Bernardinoes
form a backdrop for the desert underneath.
On beyond the railroad, beyond Barstow, into the
Granite Mountains, low, rolling, black, barren, lava-formed.
Into the Painted Hills. They are not named that
on the map. They are not named at all, and at first
I can’t believe them. But there they are beneath me.
No atmospheric trick. No effect of distance. No
subtle color either. They are really painted. There
is one over there. It sweeps out of the desert upward
into green and ends in a peak of white. There is
another, sweeping through purple to red. Others
through red to yellow. It is as if God had been playing
with colored chalks, picking up purple, perhaps,
powdering it through his fingers to drop in a purple
heap, picking up another color then to drop on top
of that in powdered brilliance, powdering then on
top of that another color still to form a brilliant,
pointed tip. Fantastic, unreal, true!
For a long time now I have seen no life. The brilliant
land is barren. I look back. I can still make
out where the railroad runs. Far, far behind, the
white Bernardinoes rise, low on the horizon now in
the distance. It is not a long flight back to the railroad,
or even a very long one back to the mountains
and over them into the green San Bernardino Valley
and March Field. But it is a long walk. It is a long
walk back even to the railroad. What if my motor
quits? I had intended to go on to Death Valley, just
to see it, circle, and return.
I bank reluctantly around and assume a reverse
compass course for home. I have seen enough for an
afternoon’s jaunt, anyway.



REMINISCENCE
I taxi out and turn my ship into the wind at the
end of the snow-plowed runway at Hagerstown Airport,
Maryland. The white hangar looms too close.
Deep snow on the rest of the field prohibits its use.
Can I get over the hangar? I give it the gun and try.
Just miss the hangar. Too close!
Head off on a compass course for New York.
Strong drift to the right from northwest wind. Head
a little more to left.
Blue Ridge Mountains pass under me. On into the
friendly undulating valley country beyond, snow
covered.
Gettysburg under my left wing. They were fighting
down there once. Hard to believe, looking down
on the peaceful fields now. Wonder what they would
have done if they could have looked up and seen me
and my airplane?
Low hills before the Susquehanna River. Their
brown contours reach like dusky fingers out into the
snow-filled valleys.
Over the river, and Lancaster off to my left. Reform
school there. That’s where they were always
going to send me when I was a bad little boy.
More valley country. Ridge-like hills. The Schuylkill
River and Norristown. Philadelphia, blue laws,
and no movies on Sundays far off to my right.
More valley. The Delaware River. Washington
crossed the Delaware. I cross it in half a minute.
The Sourland Mountains and Lindbergh’s sad
white house. I see Flemington and know the trial is
going on down there. I remember walking with Lindbergh,
ten years ago, from San Antonio, Tex., to
Kelly Field, where we were both advanced flying students.
“What are you going to do when you graduate?”
he asked. “What are you going to do?” I asked
him. Yes, what were we going to do? And now he
was down there in that courtroom, and the world
stretching out around him as far as I could see and
much, much farther was a cocked ear listening again
to his tragedy. And I was circling above in the clean
blue sky, remembering many things and thinking.
I shuddered a last long unbelieving look at Lindbergh’s
empty, lonely house, perched up on its hill,
circled and flew on. Half an hour later, on Long
Island, I kissed the chubby cheek of my own first-born
son in greeting and pitied Lindbergh somewhat
for his fame.



MEXICAN WHOOPEE!
I hadn’t seen Darr Alkire since I had resigned
from the army several years before, so when I
dropped into March Field, Calif., to say hello
and he told me that he and a couple of the other
officers were flying three ships down to Mexacali on
the Mexican border that afternoon to return the next
and asked me to go along, I said yes.
I flew down in the rear seat of Darr’s ship, and
when we landed and crossed the border everybody
proceeded to get drunk. Everybody but Yours
Truly. I had been on a party the night before I had
dropped in to see Darr and didn’t feel up to it.
The next morning we met a Mexican captain, and
everybody had to drink a lot of drinks to each other.
I still threw mine over my shoulder.
That afternoon the Mexican captain had to escort
us to the airport, just to say good-bye to us. The
leader of our formation then, no sooner had we taken
off, had to lead us in some diving passes at the Mexican
captain, just to say good-bye to him.
They were having a lot of fun dusting their wings
on the airport, saluting the captain, but I wasn’t!
Darr was sticking his wing in too close to the leader’s
for comfort. I had a set of dual controls in the rear
cockpit and couldn’t resist just a little pressure on
them to ease his wing away from the leader’s in some
of the passes or to pull him up just a little sooner in
some of the dives. It was a heluva breach of flying
ethics, but after all I was sober!
We got back to March, and Darr, sobered by
then, began telling me what a swell guy I had been
to sit back there and take it. He said he would have
taken the controls away from me, had I been flying
drunk, and he sitting back there sober. I thought he
was razzing me for a moment, but saw that he really
meant it. My pressure on the controls had been so
subtle that he hadn’t noticed it.
I didn’t bother to tell him the truth. I liked the
idea that he thought I had had enough sand to sit
there and not interfere with him. I didn’t have
enough nerve to set him straight on the matter.



IT’S A TOUGH RACKET
The hazards of a pilot’s life are sometimes different
than some people suppose.
For instance, I flew some people to a ranch in
Mexico once. I fought bad weather most of the way
from New York to Eagle Pass on the Border, skimming
mountains and swamps, and then flew eighty
miles of barren mountain and desert country to the
ranch house.
They insisted the next day that I go out hunting
with them. That meant that I had to ride a horse. I
had ridden a horse once before in my life and remembered
it as the most uncomfortable means of transportation
ever invented by man.
But I went with them. I even began to like it after
we had been out a while. I discovered that you could
wheel the horse around in a running turn and that it
was almost like banking an airplane around. I was
having pretty good fun experimenting until I
noticed that a certain portion of my anatomy was
getting very warm, and then, soon, that it was getting
very tender. Pretty soon I began to think that
we would never get back to the ranch house. When
we finally did, my pants and my anatomy were brilliantly
discolored. And when I went to take the pants
off, I noticed that quite a bond had developed between
me and them, quite an attachment indeed!
They were stuck fast and could be persuaded away
from me only with their pound of flesh.
I decided that I would stick to my airplane after
that. But the next day, I discovered that my airplane
was uncomfortable too—and I had to make a
five-hour flight to Mexico City.
When I got to Mexico City everything was uncomfortable,
and I had to eat my dinner off the
mantelpiece that night. There was an additional
humiliation. The doctor had to undress me. He had
to use plenty of hot oil and go very easy.



ALMOST
Bunny had trusted me on the outward trip, so now,
returning to March Field, Calif., I comforted myself
in the rear cockpit of our army DH with the
thought that Bunny could fly as well as I.
San Francisco lay behind us. The Diablo Mountains
were beneath. Snug around us, familiar and
friendly, was our ship.
But beyond, strange and ominous by now to
Bunny and me because we had hardly ever flown in
it before, and never for so long, stretched like a
white, opaque, and directionless night the fog.
The ship felt as if it were flying straight, but
when I peeked over Bunny’s shoulder I saw the
needle on his bank and turn indicator leaning halfway
over to the right. I watched it start back then—Bunny
was all right—to the center. But slowly then,
inexorably—Bunny! Bunny!—the needle leaned
over to the left. The ball was centered, so the turns
were good. But that was not enough. Where were we
going? Were we weaving? Circling? Which way
were we turning mostly? The ocean was not far off
to our right.
Then something else—ice! Its white hands gripped
the front of wings, the leading edge of struts and
wires. The prop got rough. The motor beat and
strained. Once the ship shivered. I saw one aileron
go down. Bunny was trying to hold a wing up. I saw
the needle straighten. He had held it. But I saw
something else too! I saw the altimeter losing. No
hope for blue sky now. No hope to ride on top until
we found a hole, as our weather report had indicated
that we would. How far were the mountain tops beneath
us? Would the ice melt off before we sank too
far?
I saw the throttle moving backward, heard the
motor taper off its friendly roar, heard Bunny’s
voice sound out like thunder in white doom.
“Let’s jump,” he shouted, turning his head halfway.
Were there mountains to land on and walk on in
the depths of that white down there? Or had we
circled out over the ocean?
“Let’s not. Let’s wait. Let’s try once more,” I
shouted back.
Then I shouted again, scraped my fingers on the
windshield, reaching, grabbed Bunny’s shoulder, but
too late. Even as I shouted, reached, and grabbed,
the ship banked on its ear, wheeled over, and dove
safely through a brown passage tunnel to the earth.
Bunny had seen it too—a hole in the fog, and
through it, ground.
The warmer lower air flowed over us. The ice
dripped from our wings in glistening drops. We
came out in the San Joaquin Valley with plenty of
ceiling, and it was plain sailing from there on.



RUN! RUN! RUN!
It is a bright, golden day in Texas. A little
Mexican boy is working in a field of sugar cane just
back of Kelly Field. The airplanes from the field
are droning in the sleepy air above his head. Occasionally
he pauses in his work to glance half curiously
at one of them. He is not much interested in
them. They are like the automobiles swishing
endlessly past on the highway near by. He is accustomed
to them. And besides, they are not of his world.
Sometimes the long motor roar of a ship coming
out of a dive attracts his half-hearted attention.
Occasionally an intricate formation maneuver over
his head warrants his momentary gaze. Often he
stares, half abstractedly, skyward while he works.
Like a shoe cobbler in a window watching the crowds
passing in the street.
This time, however, a curious interruption in the
steady beating drone of a three-ship formation of
DHs passing over him makes him involuntarily
raise his head from his work. It is a strange sound,
somehow ominous to him. He is accustomed to hearing
the motors run. Even their tapering off for a
landing is a different noise than this one. His unknowingly
trained ears and maybe some strange
premonition tell him that.
He sees two of the three ships locked together in
collision. He sees them, startlingly silent and arrested
in their flight, falling in their own débris. He sees
two black objects leave the wrecks. He sees a white
streamer trail out behind each of them and then
blossom open into two swinging, slowly floating
parachutes. He stands with his head thrown back,
his Indian eyes rapt in his Asiatic face.
Suddenly he is alarmed, then full of fear. The two
milling wrecks, black harbingers of doom by now,
are going to fall on him. He begins to run. Any way,
any direction at all. He runs as fast as his little
brown legs will carry him. He covers a considerable
distance from where he was standing by the time
the wrecks hit.
The spot he runs from, unruffled, undisturbed, lies
warming, sleeping in the sun. The wrecks don’t hit
that spot. They hit him, running.
The world that was not his has folded darkened
crumpled wings of death around him.



HIGH FIGHT
One of the briefest and most amusing family
fights I have ever listened in on occurred in an airplane.
I was flying its owner and his wife to the
coast.
We came in over the Mohave Desert, crossed the
mountains at the desert’s western edge, and started
out over the valley, where I knew Los Angeles lay
thirteen thousand feet beneath us. The valley and
the ocean beyond were covered with fog, and I could
see nothing but the white, billowed stretch of it and
the tawny mountains rising out of it behind us.
I spiraled down and went through a hole in the
fog near the foot of the mountains. It was lower and
thicker underneath than I had hoped. I picked up a
railroad and started weaving my way along it into
the airport.
The owner of the ship, sitting on my right, was
helping me with my map, holding it for me. His wife,
sitting behind me, was squirming anxiously in her
seat and peering tensely out of the windows through
the low mists.
Soon she tapped me on the shoulder and said,
“Aren’t we flying awfully low?”
I half turned my head and shouted, “Yes, the ceiling
is awfully low.” I wanted to add, “You fool,”
but didn’t dare.
“Isn’t it dangerous?” she whined.
“We’re all right,” I shouted. “I’ve flown stuff
like this before. I can handle it.”
Pretty soon she tapped me on the shoulder again.
“Where are we?” she inquired.
“I can’t tell you the exact spot,” I shouted, “but
we are still on the right railroad and will be coming
into the airport in a few minutes.”
We passed over a town section just then, and the
railroad branched three ways under us. I made a
quick jump at my map to check which of the three
I should follow. The wife saw me jump and must
have seen that I looked worried. She tapped me on
the shoulder again.
“Oh, are you sure we are going the right way?”
she whimpered.
I started to turn around to explain to her what I
was doing and why, realized my flying required all
my attention right then, cast an appealing glance at
her husband, clamped my jaws tight, and started
studying landmarks. We were in close to the airport,
and I didn’t want to miss it.
I heard the husband shout one of the funniest
mixtures of supplication and command I have ever
heard.
“Now listen, honey,” he shouted at her. “You keep
your damn mouth shut, sweetheart.”



GESTURE AT REUNIONS
It is the year before Lindbergh becomes famous.
I have graduated in the same class with him from the
army flying school the year before and have seen him
only twice since. I am on an army cross-country trip,
bound for St. Louis, when I land at Chicago and
run into him. He is just taking off with the mail,
bound for St. Louis too, and we decide to fly down
together in formation.
It is getting dark when we sight the river at St.
Louis in the distance. Lindbergh shakes his wings.
He is calling my attention. I pull my ship in close to
his. I see him pointing from his cockpit. I look ahead
and see a speck. It grows rapidly larger. I make it
out as another DH approaching us head on from
the deepening dusk. It comes up, swings around into
formation with us, and sticks its wing right up into
mine. Its pilot peers at me, and I peer at him. We
recognize each other. It is Red Love. Red, Lindbergh,
and myself were three of the four cadets in
our pursuit class at flying school. Looks like a class
reunion in the air.
But no. Lindbergh is shaking his wings. He is
banking. He is pointing down. He spirals down,
circles a field, flies low over it several times, dragging
it, looking it over carefully, and lands. Red and I
follow.
Lindbergh and I crawl out of our ships with
parachutes strapped to us. Red crawls out of his
without one. Lindbergh takes his off as the three of
us converge for greetings.
“You will need this getting the mail on into Chicago
the rest of the way in the dark tonight,” he
says to Red, holding the chute out to him.
“It’s the only one in the company,” he says, turning,
explaining to me, “and I won’t need it for the
few miles on into St. Louis from here.”
We say hasty greetings and good-byes, crawl
back into our still idling ships, and take off. Lindbergh,
chuteless now, heads off south for St. Louis,
and I follow. Red swings off in the opposite direction
for Chicago.
I look back. I see Red disappearing into the darkening
north. I know he feels better now, sitting on
that chute.



AS I SAW IT
I had to go to Cleveland to bring back a ship that
a student of mine had left there in bad weather. I got
on an airliner, with a parachute. The chute was for
use on the way back.
The airline porter wanted to put my chute in the
baggage compartment. My argument was: “What
good would it do me there?” The porter looked offended,
but I kept my attitude and took my chute
to my seat with me.
We took off from Newark after dark. The weather
was bad, and we went blind three minutes after we
took off.
I tried to console myself with the thought that
the pilots were specially trained in blind flying, that
they had instruments, had two motors, had radio,
that everything was just ducky. But I couldn’t even
see the wing tips.
I tried to read my magazine. I found myself peering
out of the windows through the darkness to see
if we had come out on top yet.
I tried to nap. I found myself hearing the motors
getting slightly louder, knowing we were nosing
down; feeling myself getting slightly heavier in my
seat, knowing the pilot was correcting; hearing the
motors begin to labor slightly, knowing we were
nosing up; feeling myself getting ever so slightly
lighter in my seat, knowing the pilot was correcting
again; telling myself repeatedly that he knew his
stuff and that there wasn’t anything I could do
about it anyway, but sitting there going through
every motion with him just the same.
Two hours later we were still blind, and my nose
was pressing up against the windowpane almost constantly.
The other passengers probably thought I
had never been in a ship before.
Half an hour later we were still blind and only
half an hour out of Cleveland. We broke out of the
stuff finally just outside of Cleveland. We were flying
low, and the lights were still going dim under
us as we skimmed along not very far above them.
There wasn’t much ceiling when we landed, and it
closed in shortly after that.
Most of the passengers roused themselves from
sleep when we landed. I was plenty wide awake. I
knew that ship hadn’t had much gas range. If we
had got stuck, we would have had to come down
someway before very long. If those passengers could
have read my mind, or I think even the pilot’s, there
probably would have been a battle in the cabin over
my chute.



WAS MY FACE RED!
I took off at Buffalo one time to do a test job. I
had been called up there as an expert and was supposed
to be pretty hot stuff.
I took the ship off and started rocking it violently
from side to side. I kept this up through a variety
of speed ranges, watching the ailerons closely all the
time. I wanted to find out first of all if the ailerons
had any tendency to flutter under a high angle of
attack condition. Then I began horsing on the stick
to see if anything unusual happened to the ailerons
when I introduced the high angle of attack condition
that way.
I interrupted my observations of the ship’s behavior
after a while to look around for the airport. I
couldn’t find it! I had forgotten that I was in a high-speed
ship and could get far away from the field in
a very short time. Furthermore, the country was
unfamiliar to me, and I had no map. Gee, if I had
only thought to stick a map in the ship before I took
off.
I knew the airport was somewhere on the west side
of town. I thought it was somewhat north. But how
far north I didn’t know. I couldn’t remember even
if it was close in to town or far out. I had a vague
idea it was far out, but how far out I didn’t know. If
I had only thought to bring a map! Or if I had only
kept the airport in sight. Good old hindsight!
I was panic-stricken. There I was, a supposedly
high-powered test pilot, lost over the airport. What
a dumb position for me to be in!
Before I found the airport by just cruising
around looking haphazardly for it, I might be forced
down by the weather, which was none too good and
getting worse, or I might run out of gas. What if I
was finally forced to pick a strange field, a pasture
or something, and cracked up getting into it? How
would I explain that?
I decided to cruise north and south, up and down,
in ten- or fifteen-mile laps, starting far enough out
of town to be sure to fly over the airport on one of
the laps as I moved closer in on each one. That would
be at least an orderly procedure.
I found the field on my fourth lap. But was I in a
sweat! And did I keep my eye on that field after
that!



CO-PILOT
Dick Blythe, who handled Lindbergh’s publicity
not only after Lindbergh came back from Paris but
also, as Dick stated to me, just before Lindbergh
went to Paris, is a bit of aviation folklore in himself.
I just ran into Dick over at the Roosevelt Field
restaurant, and he told me this one about Dean
Smith. Dean is one of the oldest air-mail pilots. He
started flying the mail ’way back in the postoffice
days, just after the war. He is a lean six-foot-two,
easy-going guy who would never talk much about his
flying.
Dick caught him just after he had returned from
one of his crackups in the Alleghanies in the old days
when Roosevelt Field was called Curtiss Field and
the mail went out of there instead of out of Newark
as it does now. Dean was just pouring his long self
into the cockpit of another DH to take the night
mail out again.
“Where in the hell have you been?” Dick greeted
him.
“Oh,” Dean said, “I had a hell of a time the other
night. Just got back.”
“What happened?” Dick asked him.
“Aw, I got tangled up with a load of ice after
dark. She started losing altitude, and I eased a little
more gun to her. She kept on losing, so I eased a
little more gun to her. She still kept on losing, so I
eased all the gun she had. She was squashing right
down into the trees. I had done everything I knew
and couldn’t hold her up. So I said, ‘Here, God, you
fly it awhile,’ and turned her loose and threw my
arms up in front of my face.
“I guess it must have been tough, because He
cracked her up. He piled into that last ridge just
outside of Bellefonte.”



ORCHIDS TO ME!
The late Lya de Putti, German screen actress, paid
me the nicest compliment of all.
She was up front in the two-place passenger compartment
of a Lockheed Sirius. The owner of that
plane was in the pilot’s open cockpit just back of
her. And I was behind him in the rear cockpit.
He had insisted, against my better judgment,
upon getting into that pilot’s cockpit in the first
place. But, after all, he owned the ship, I was only
his pilot, and there was a set of dual controls in the
rear cockpit.
The motor quit cold over Whitehall, N. Y., because
we ran out of gas in one of the six tanks in the
ship. I shouted back and forth with the ship’s owner,
halfway to the ground, trying to tell him how to turn
on one of the other five tanks. There was a complicated
system of gas valves in the ship, and I couldn’t
make him understand what to do, and I couldn’t
reach the valves myself.
Finally I shouted, “You play with them. I’ll
land,” and stuck my head out and looked around.
We were already low. I picked a small plowed field,
the only likely-looking one in the mountainous country,
and started into it.
I was coming around my last turn into the field
when I discovered high-tension wires stretching right
across the edge of it. I was too low to pick another
field. The field was too small to go over the wires. I
had to go through a gap in the trees to get under
them.
I kicked the ship around sidewise. The trees
flashed past me on either side, and I hit the ground.
The wires flashed past over my head. I used my
brakes and stopped the fast ship very quickly in the
soft ground. If we had rolled fifty feet farther we
would have hit an embankment that rose sharply at
the far end of the field.
I crawled out of my cockpit and started to help
Lya out of her cabin. She was already emerging,
fanning herself with a handkerchief. She spoke with
a German accent.
“Oh, Jeemy,” she said, “all the way down I pray
to God. But I thank you, Jeemy. I thank you.”



RECOVERY ACT
Johnny Wagner came up to me for his transport
pilot’s license test. I was the inspector for the Department
of Commerce. Johnny knew I was “tough.”
As a matter of fact, he figured I was much tougher
than I was.
I knew Johnny and liked him. He was crazy about
flying and had worked hard to get his flying training.
He had pushed ships in and out of hangars,
washed them, acted as night watchman and office
boy, done anything and everything to pay for his
flying time. But I didn’t have the slightest idea
how he flew. And after all, you may be a swell guy
but not be able to fly worth a cent, and a transport
test is supposed to determine whether you are safe
to carry passengers.
I found out three minutes after Johnny got in the
ship how he flew. Nevertheless, I made him go all
through the test. When he came to steep banks I
made him pull them in tight. He was reluctant to do
it, so I took the ship to do it myself to show him. I
could see right away why he was reluctant. It was
the way the ship was rigged. It had a tendency to
roll under in a tightly pulled in steep bank. But I
wanted to see what he would do with it, so I made
him do it. He did, and rolled right under into a
power spin. He had gone into an inadvertent spin,
the unforgivable sin in a flight test.
I started to reach for the controls but let him go.
When he had pulled out of the spin I told him to
land.
He got out of the ship with his face as long as a
poker. He couldn’t even talk, the test had meant so
much to him. I didn’t say anything for a moment,
then with a stern face I said roughly, “Well,” and
waited a moment. The poor kid was getting all set
for the worst. I could tell by his face.
“Well,” I went on, “you passed,” and I smiled
broadly at him.
His mouth fell open. “But—but—” he stuttered—“but
I spun out of that steep bank!”
“Yeah, I know,” I said. “But you also recovered.
It was the way you recovered. You stopped that spin
like that and recovered from the resultant dive
neatly and smoothly, with a minimum loss of altitude
and still without squashin’ the ship. It was a beautiful
piece of work and told me more about your flying
than anything else you did, although I could tell in
the first three minutes that you could fly.” I never
saw a kid beam so much.
Johnny is now flying a regular run over the Andes
in South America for Pan American Grace.



“A ROSE BY ANY OTHER NAME....”
I delivered a plane at a ranch in Mexico a few
years ago for Joe and Alicia Brooks. I was to take
back the ship they had been using. The ranch was
about eighty miles over the border from Eagle Pass.
The Brookses planned to leave with me and fly
formation to New York. Both planes had approximately
the same cruising speed. Alicia and I flew in
one ship. Sutter, the mechanic, flew with Joe in the
other.
The day we started didn’t look too good. Thick
gray clouds were rolling in from the northeast. There
was no way we could check our weather till we got to
Eagle Pass. We had to take a chance on the eighty
miles.
Joe led the way, and everything went fine at the
start, but the nearer we got to Eagle Pass the worse
the weather got. We were flying on top of a jerkwater
railway, just missing the tops of the trees,
when we bumped into a solid wall of fog. Joe disappeared
into it. I stuck my nose in the stuff and
pulled out: there was no percentage in two planes
milling around blind. Too much chance of collision.
I picked out a spot in between the cactus and landed.
There was nothing to do but wait. If Joe came out
he would come out on the railway and we would see
him. Ten uncomfortable minutes passed. We heard a
motor. Joe reappeared. He circled and landed alongside
of us.
By this time the planes were surrounded by a herd
of angry shrieking Mexicans. There must have been
over a hundred of them. They didn’t seem to like us,
but we couldn’t find out why. None of us spoke
Spanish. Finally an official-looking fellow appeared
with a lot of brass medals on his coat. He made us
understand through the sign language that he
wanted to see our passports. We couldn’t find them.
The atmosphere was most unpleasant. We had visions
of spending the next few days in a flea-bitten
Mexican jail.
Then it occurred to me that I did know one Spanish
word. Might as well use it, I thought, and see
what happens. “Cerveza” I commanded. The Mexicans
looked startled. “Cerveza” I commanded again.
The Mexicans started to laugh.
The next thing we knew, we were sitting at a Mexican
bar drinking beer with a lot of newfound
friends. Cerveza is the Spanish for beer.



“YES, SIR!”
Our jenny hit the ground wheels first and bounced
dangerously. My instructor in the cockpit in front
of me grabbed his controls, gave the ship a sharp
burst of the gun, and set her down right. We were
in a little practice field near Brooks Field in Texas.
My instructor turned around to me: “Damn it,
Collins,” he said, “don’t run into the ground wheels
first like that. Level off about six feet in the air and
wait until the ship begins to settle. Then ease the
stick back. When you feel the ship begin to fall out
from under you, pull the stick all the way back into
your guts and the ship will set itself down. Go
around and try it again.”
“Yes, sir.”
I came in the next time, hit the ground wheels
first, and bounced. My instructor righted the ship.
“No, Collins. No,” he fumed. “Six feet. Look, I’ll
show you what six feet looks like.”
He took the ship off and flew over the open fields,
then came around and landed.
“Now do you know what six feet looks like?” he
shouted back to me.
“Yes, sir,” I lied. I was afraid to tell him that I
could not see the ground right. He might send me to
the hospital to have my eyes examined. They might
find some slight defect in my eyes that they had overlooked
in the original examination and wash me out
of the school.
“Well, then, go around and make a decent landing
for me,” my instructor said.
“Yes, sir.”
I leveled off too high the next time. My instructor
grabbed his controls and prevented us from cracking
up.
“Damn it, Collins,” he shouted when the ship had
stopped rolling, “don’t run into the ground wheels
first. And don’t level off as high as the telegraph
wires. Level off at about six feet. Then set her down.
Now go round and try it again.”
“Yes, sir.”
“Damn it, Collins, don’t sit back there and say
‘Yes, sir’ and then do the same damned thing again.”
“No, sir.”



MOONLIGHT AND SILVER
Pat paints. She also flies.
Pat and I landed at Jacksonville, Fla., late one
night in Pat’s Stearman biplane. Pat was taking
cross-country instruction from me. We gassed hurriedly
and took off again. We left the glare of the
floodlights behind us as we headed our ship along the
line of flashing beacons stretching southward toward
Miami. The stars were brilliant in the cloudless sky,
but the night was very dark. There was no moon.
Soon we were flying down the coast. White breakers
rolled in under us from the Atlantic Ocean on
our left and dimly marked the coast line. Swamps
stretched away to the inland on our right but were
invisible in the black night. Beacons flashed brilliantly
out of the darkness in a long line far behind
us and far ahead. Blotches of lights slipped slowly
past under us when we flew over towns.
We saw clouds ahead. We nosed down under them.
We had to fly uncomfortably low to stay under the
clouds. We nosed up to get above them.
We flew into them. The lights beneath us dimmed
and disappeared. We climbed in opaque blackness,
flying by instruments.
We emerged into an open space where the clouds
were broken. The lights reappeared. The stars became
visible.
The clouds spread out under us to the horizon in
all directions. They were lit a dim silver by the stars.
They softly undulated like a mystic, limitless sea
beneath us.
Now and then we saw a break in the clouds and
caught the flash of a beacon through it or saw the
lights of a town. We caught glimpses of dim
breakers rolling in on the beach far down under the clouds.
Something I couldn’t explain was happening. The
sky in the east was getting lighter. It was only about
midnight. I looked at the western sky and then
looked back at the eastern sky. Yes, the sky was
definitely getting lighter in the east. Half an hour
later the eastern sky was much lighter than the
western sky.
I watched toward the east.
I saw a thin, blood-red tip of something rise up
from the eastern horizon. The top of the object was
rounded. The bottom of it was irregular in shape.
The object got larger rapidly.
“The moon!” I shouted out loud to myself.
It rose rapidly. Invisible clouds far out at sea,
silhouetted against the moon, gave the bottom of it
its irregular shape.
The moon got up above the clouds in an incredibly
short time. It was a full moon, golden and glorious.
It made the clouds between me and it seem darker.
It made the sea beneath the clouds silver. Through
the large breaks in the clouds I saw a beam of moonlight
like a golden path from the moon across the
sea to the beach beneath us. The beam traveled with
us. It raced across the sea under the clouds at the
same speed that we flew through the air above the
clouds.
I eased the throttle back and slowed the ship
down.
“Paint that some day,” I shouted to Pat.
Pat was gazing out across the ocean toward the
moon. She didn’t say anything. I knew she had heard
me.



FIVE MILES UP
I was stationed at Selfridge Field after I graduated
from the Advanced Flying School at Kelly. The
Army Air Corps’ First Pursuit Group was at Selfridge.
The officers used to gather every morning at
eight-fifteen in the post operator’s office. We would
be assigned to our various functions in the formation.
Then we would fly formation for an hour or so,
practicing different tactical maneuvers. After flying
we would gather at the operations office again for a
general critique, which was supposed to conclude the
official day’s flying. We would separate from there
and go about our various ground duties. I discovered
I could quickly finish my ground duties and have a
lot of time left over for extra flying. I used to bother
the operations officer to death asking him for ships.
He usually gave me one, and I would go up alone
and practice all sorts of things just for fun. It was
no part of my work. It was pure exuberance.
One day I was flying around idly in a Hawk. I
decided I would take the Hawk as high as I could,
just for the hell of it.
I opened the throttle and nosed up. I gained the
first few thousand feet rapidly. The higher I went
the slower I climbed. At 20,000 feet climbing was
difficult. The air was much thinner. The power of
my engine was greatly diminished. I began to notice
the effect of altitude. Breathing was an effort. I
didn’t get enough air when I did breathe. I sighed
often. My heart beat faster. I wasn’t sleepy. I was
dopey. I was very cold, although it was summer.
I looked up into the sky. It was intensely blue,
deep blue; bluer than I had ever seen a sky. I was
above all haze. I looked down at the earth. Selfridge
Field was very small under me. The little town of
Mount Clemens seemed to be very close to the field.
Lake St. Clair was just a little pond. Detroit seemed
to be almost under me, although I knew it was about
twenty miles from Selfridge Field. I could see a lot
of little Michigan towns clothing the earth to the
north and northwest of Selfridge. Everything beneath
me seemed to have shoved together. The earth
seemed to be without movement. I felt suspended in
enormous space. I was 23,000 feet high by my altimeter.
I was dopey. My perception and reaction were
ga-ga. I was cold, too. To hell with it. It said 24,500
feet. I eased the throttle full and nosed down.
I lost altitude very rapidly and with very little
effort at first. After that it got more and more normal.
I didn’t come down too fast. It was too loud on
my ears. I came down fairly slowly, so as to accommodate
myself to the change in air pressure as I
descended.
It was warm and stuffy on the ground.
I saw the Flight Surgeon at dinner that evening.
“I worked a Hawk up to 24,500 feet today,” I
told him proudly. “Gee, it sure felt funny up there
without oxygen.”
“Without oxygen?” he asked.
I nodded my head.
“You’re crazy,” he said. “You can’t go that high
without oxygen. The average pilot’s limit is around
15,000 to 18,000 feet. You’re young and in good
shape. Maybe you got to twenty. But you just imagined
you went higher than that.”
“No, I didn’t imagine it,” I said. “I really went
up that high.”
“You went ga-ga and imagined it,” he said.
He added: “Don’t fool around with that sort of
business. You’re likely to pass out cold at any moment
when you’re flying too high without oxygen.
You’re likely to pass out cold and fall a long way
before regaining consciousness. You might break
your neck.”



AËRIAL COMBAT
I was flying in a student pursuit formation of
SE-5s. Another student pursuit formation of
MB3As was flying several thousand feet above us.
The formation above us was supposed to be enemy
pursuit on the offensive. My formation was supposed
to be on the defensive. We were staging a mimic
combat. Kelly Field, the army Advanced Flying
School, lay beneath us.
I had to watch my flight leader, the other ships in
my formation, and the enemy formation.
I saw the enemy formation behind us and above
us in position to attack. I saw it nose down toward
us.
I looked at my flight leader’s plane. He was signaling
a sharp turn to the left. He banked sharply to
the left. Everybody in our formation banked sharply
to the left with him. The attacking formation passed
over our tails and pulled up to our right.
I saw the attacking formation above us to our
right, banking to the left, nosing down to attack us
broadside.
I looked at my flight leader. He was signaling
a turn to the right. He turned sharply to the right.
Our whole formation turned with him. We were
heading directly into the oncoming attack of the
other formation.
Just as I straightened out of my turn my ship
lurched violently and I got a fleeting impression of
something passing over my head. I couldn’t figure
out what had happened. My leader was signaling
for another turn. I followed him through several
quick turns in rapid succession. We were dodging
the enemy formation. I kept trying to figure out
what had happened when my ship had lurched.
Then it occurred to me: Somebody in the attacking
formation, when the formation had been diving
head on into ours, had pulled up just in time to keep
from hitting me head on. I had passed under him
and immediately behind him as he pulled up, and
the turbulent slip stream just back of his ship was
what had caused my ship to lurch.
I felt weak all over. God, how close he must have
come, I thought!
Later, on the ground, we stood around our instructors,
listening to criticism of our flying. I
wasn’t listening very much. I was looking around
at the faces of the other students. I saw another
student looking around too. It was Lindbergh. He
had been flying in the attacking formation. After the
criticism was over I walked up to Lindbergh.
“Say,” I said, “did you come close to anybody in
that head-on attack?”
He grinned all over.
“Yes,” he said. “Was that you?”
“Yes.”
“Did you see me?” he asked.
“No,” I said. “I felt you.”
“It is a good thing you didn’t see me,” Lindbergh
said, “because if you had seen me you would have
pulled up, too, and we would have hit head on.”



WINGS OVER AKRON
Tom was flying in front of me to my left. We both
had PW-8s. We were heading toward Uniontown,
Pa. They were opening a field there. We were going
to stunt for them. We were flying 7,000 feet high in
a milky autumn haze. The rolling Ohio country beneath
us was visible only straight down and out to
an angle of about 45 degrees. Beyond that the earth
mingled with the haze and was invisible.
I saw a town over the leading edge of my lower
right wing. I recognized it as Akron, O. I pushed my
stick forward and opened my throttle. I had always
wanted to jazz the fraternity house in a high-powered
fast ship.
Down I came. Roaring louder and louder. I
couldn’t see a soul in the yard of the fraternity
house.
I missed the house by inches as I pulled sharply
out of my dive and zoomed almost vertically up for
altitude. I looked back as I shot up into the sky. The
yard was full of fellows.
I kicked over and nosed down at the house again.
I came as close to it as I could without hitting it as
I pulled back and thundered up into the air.
I nosed over into a third dive at the house. As I
pulled up this time I kicked the ship into a double
snap roll as I climbed. I didn’t look back. I just kept
on climbing, heading for Uniontown. I overtook
Tom a little while later.
On my return trip from Uniontown I was forced
down at Akron owing to bad weather. Tom had gone
back a day earlier than I. I was alone.
Friends of mine at the airport came up to me as
I climbed out of my ship. They asked me if I had
flown over Akron in a PW-8 a few days before. I said,
“No. Why?” They showed me a clipping from a
local newspaper. It said:
AIRMAN STARTLES AKRON—MANY LIVES ENDANGERED

At noon today a small fast biplane appeared
over Akron and proceeded to throw the populace
into a panic by performing a series of zooms and
dives and perilous nose spins low over the business
section of town. Onlookers said that the plane narrowly
missed hitting the tops of the buildings and
that it several times almost dove into the crowds
in the streets.
Hospital authorities complained to city officials
that the plane roared low over the hospital, frightening
many of their patients and endangering the
lives of others. Other complaints have rolled in
from all over the city.
City officials told reporters that the name of
the pilot is known. He was a former resident of
Akron and was a student at Akron University. At
present he is on duty with the Army Aviation
Service. Officials said they had reported the outrageous
act to the military authorities at the
pilot’s home station.

“I wonder who that damned fool could have been,”
I said as I handed the clipping back to my friends.
I grinned.
I was staying with my uncle. I didn’t have much
appetite for dinner that night. I didn’t sleep very
well.
“What is the matter, Jim?” my uncle asked me at
breakfast the next morning. “Why don’t you eat
more?”
“I don’t feel very well,” I said.
I got back to Selfridge that afternoon. Nobody
there had heard of my escapade.
I ate a big dinner that evening.



TEARS AND ACROBATICS
“Go around and try it again,” I shouted.
“Yes, sir,” the cadet in the rear cockpit behind
me shouted back.
I felt the throttle under my left hand go all the
way forward with a jerk. I pulled it back.
“Open that throttle slower and smoother,” I
shouted back. I didn’t look round. I just turned my
head to the left and put my open right hand up to
the right side of my mouth. That threw my voice
back.
“Yes, sir,” came the cadet’s voice from the rear
cockpit.
I felt the throttle under my left hand move forward
slowly, smoothly. The engine noise rose louder.
The ship rocked and bumped slowly forward over the
rough ground. The tail of the ship came up, and
the nose went down. The nose of the ship veered to
the left. I wanted to kick right rudder to bring the
nose back. I just sat there. The nose swung back
straight and then veered badly to the right. I wanted
to kick left rudder and bring the nose back. I didn’t
move. The nose stopped veering. We were going
pretty fast. We bumped the ground once more and
bounced into the air. We stayed there. I took my
nose between my left thumb and forefinger and
turned my head to the left so the cadet behind me
could see my profile.
The ship banked to the left. I felt a blast of air
strong on the right side of my face and felt myself
being pushed to the right side of my cockpit. We
were skidding. I wanted to ease a little right rudder
on and stop the skid. Instead, I patted the right side
of my face several times with my right hand so the
cadet could see it. I felt the rudder pedal under my
right foot jerk forward. We stopped skidding. The
ship straightened out of the bank and flew straight
and level for a little way. It made another left-hand
bank, leveled out again, and flew straight again for
a little way. It did it again. I felt the throttle under
my left hand come all the way back. The engine noise
quieted down, and the engine exhaust popped a few
times. The ship nosed down into a glide. It made
another left turn in the glide and then straightened
out. We were gliding toward the little field we had
just taken off from. It was a little field near Brooks
that the Army Primary Flying School used as a
practice field.
“That was lousy,” I shouted back. “You jerked
your throttle open. You veered across the field on
your take-off like a drunken man. Are you too weak
to kick rudder? You skidded on your turns. You
landed cross-wind. Go around and try it again. See
if you can do something right this time.” It was
about the twentieth speech like that I had shouted
back to the cadet that morning.
I felt the throttle under my left hand jerk forward.
I pulled it back.
“Damn it, open that throttle slower and——”
A voice from the rear cockpit broke in on me:
“I hope you never get anyone else as dumb as I
am, Lieutenant.”
The voice was choked. The kid was crying.
“Hey, listen here,” I said, “I give you a lot of hell
because I’m as anxious for you to get this stuff as
you are to get it. I wouldn’t even give you hell if I
thought you were hopeless. Sit back and relax and
forget it a while now. You’ll do better tomorrow.”
The cadet started to open his mouth. I turned
hastily around and sat down in my cockpit and
opened the throttle wide open. The engine roared. I
didn’t hear what the cadet said.
I took off in a sharp climbing turn. I dove low at
the ground, flew under some high-tension wires. I
pulled up and dove low at a cow in a pasture. The
cow jumped very amusingly. I pulled up and did a
loop. I came out of the loop very close to the ground.
It was all against army orders. It was all fun. I
pulled back up to a respectable altitude and flew sedately
over Brooks Field. I cut the gun to land. I
looked back at the cadet. He was laughing. There
were little channels in the dust on his face where the
tears had run down.



ACROSS THE CONTINENT
It was 1:45 a. m. The lights of United Airport at
Burbank, Calif., where I had left the ground fifteen
minutes before, had disappeared. I knew the low
mountains were beneath me, but I couldn’t see them.
I knew the high mountains several miles east of me
were higher than I was, but I couldn’t see them. I
could see the glow of the luminous-painted dials in
my instrument board in front of me. I could see the
sea of lights of Los Angeles and vicinity south of me,
stretching southeastward. I could see the stars in the
cloudless, moonless sky above. I was circling for altitude
to go over the high mountains.
At 13,000 feet I leveled out and assumed a compass
course for Wichita, Kan. I passed over the high
mountains without ever seeing them. I saw only an
occasional light in the blackness beneath me where
I knew the mountains were. I knew from my map
that there were low mountains and desert valleys
beyond.
Greener country. Fertile valleys. Mountains looming.
The Sangre de Cristo range loomed high in
front of me. Twelve thousand feet. I passed over it
into the undulating low country beyond it. Soon I
was flying over the flat fertile plains of western
Kansas.
Gas trucks were waiting for me at Wichita Airport.
Reporters asked me questions. They took pictures.
They told me I was behind Lindbergh’s time.
A woman out of the crowd jumped up on the side
of my ship and kissed me. I was off the ground,
headed for New York, fifteen minutes after I had
landed.
It was very rough. It was hot. I was miserable in
my fur flying suit. I ached like hell from sitting on
the hard parachute pack and wished I could stand
up for a while. I hadn’t had a chance to step out of
the ship at Wichita.
Clouds gone. Towns closer together. Towns larger.
Farms smaller. More railroads and paved roads. Industrial
towns. On into the rolling country of eastern
Ohio.
Pittsburgh was covered with smoke. The Allegheny
Mountains were dim in a haze. It was getting
dark.
Mountains beneath me in the dusk like dreams
floating past. Stars appearing in the clear sky.
Lights coming on in the houses and towns.
It was dark now. The flashing beacons along the
Cleveland-New York mail run were visible off to my
left.
New York. An ocean of shimmering light in the
darkness, spreading immensely under me. Beyond
stretched Long Island. I could see where the field
ought to be. Did I see the Roosevelt Field beacon?
Was that it? What was that beacon over there? I
saw hundreds of beacons. Beacons everywhere.
Every color of flashing beacon. Then I remembered
it was Fourth of July night. I would have a hell of
a time locating the field. Finally I distinguished
Roosevelt Field lights from the fireworks, and dove
low over the field. The flood lights came on. My red-and-white
low-wing Lockheed Sirius glided out of the
darkness, low over the edge of the field, brilliantly
into the floodlight glare, landed and rolled to a stop.
There was a crowd at the field. Roosevelt was giving
a night demonstration. People ran out of the
crowd toward me. George jumped up on the wing
and leaned over the edge of my cockpit. I was taxiing
toward the hangar.
“That did it,” Pick shouted over the noise of my
engine.
“Did what?” I shouted back.
“Broke the record, boy!”
“You’re crazy as hell,” I answered. It took me
sixteen and a half hours. Lindbergh made it in fourteen
forty-five.



THE FLYER HIKES HOME
I was hanging around Roosevelt Field one afternoon
with nothing much on my mind when a couple
of friends came up and said they were just taking
off for the South. They wanted to catch the Pan-American
plane from Miami the next day. They were
amateur pilots. The weather was lousy toward the
South and they hadn’t had much experience in blind
or night flying. I said I would fly with them as far as
Washington and maybe by that time the weather
would clear. When we got to Washington the
weather had pretty well closed down. I didn’t like
to see them start off in a fog bank with the sun
already setting, so I volunteered to go to Greensborough.
The stuff grew thicker. We were flying at
two hundred feet and getting lower all the time. So
when we landed at Greensborough there was nothing
to do but stick with the ship. We took off for Jacksonville
after a scanty supper. It was one o’clock in
the morning. By that time I could barely make out
the beacon lights. I turned to the girl sitting next to
me and told her that if we lost the beacon behind us
before we saw the one ahead of us we would have to
turn back. At that moment both beacons disappeared.
I started to bank the ship towards home.
And then suddenly the whole sky lightened up. It
looked as though a huge broom had gone to work
to tidy up the clouds.
We landed at Jacksonville at five in the morning
without further mishap. I said good-bye to plane
and passengers and then started wondering how I
was going to get back to New York. I decided to
hitch-hike and save the train fare. It took me three
days. When I appeared at the house with a straw
behind each ear and a suit full of holes my wife
thought I had gone crazy.



KILLED BY KINDNESS
Earle R. Southee was so good-hearted he killed a
guy. I don’t mean that he actually killed him, but
you can see for yourself from the following story
that, nevertheless, he killed him.
Southee was a civilian flying instructor to the
army before the war, when the Signal Corps was the
flying branch of the army. He was also an instructor
during the war, after the Air Service had been
created.
It was while he was instructing at Wilbur Wright
Field during the war that he met up with this guy.
The guy had come down there to learn to fly and
then go to France and shoot Germans—or get shot
by them. For some reason or other he couldn’t pick
the stuff up. Some people are like that. They simply
can’t get going when they first start to learn to fly.
Most of them actually have no flying ability and
ought to quit trying. It’s not in their blood. But
occasionally you run across one who later gets going
and is all right.
This guy came up to Southee for washout flight.
He was so obviously broken up over the idea that he
was going to get kicked out of the Air Service into
some other branch of service, he loved flying so
much, that Southee took pity on him, held him over
a while, gave him special instruction, and finally got
the guy through. The guy even became an instructor
himself, and a very good one.
Later, most of the gang was transferred to Ellington
Field, Houston, Tex. At Ellington, this guy had
such a tough time at first, got so hot, that he was
made a check pilot and put in charge of a stage or
section.
One day one of the students came up to him for
washout check. The kid was just as broken up about
it as he was. He gave the kid a chance, like Southee
had given him. Three days later the student froze
on him, spun him in, and lulled him.



THE FIRST CRACK-UP
I sat in the cockpit of an army DH, high over
southern Texas. I was heading toward Kelly Field,
the Army Advanced Flying School. I was returning
from a student trip to Corpus Christi.
I was looking behind me. Beyond the tail of the
ship I could see the Gulf of Mexico. Far out over the
Gulf was a low string of white clouds. The sky was
very blue. The water flashed in the sun.
Occasionally I turned to scan my instrument
board, but mostly I looked behind me. Purple distance
slowly swallowed up the Gulf.
I turned around and faced forward and lit a cigarette.
I looked at my instrument board. I looked at
my map. The course line on my map lay between two
railroads. I looked down at the earth. I was directly
over a railroad, flying parallel to it. To my right a
little distance ran another railroad, parallel to the
one I was flying over. Another railroad lay off to my
left. I could not decide which two of the three railroads
I should be flying between.
I saw a little town on the railroad under me. I
throttled back and nosed down. I circled low over the
town and located the railroad station. I dove low past
one end of the station and tried to read the name of
the town on the station as I flashed past it. I didn’t
make it out. I opened the throttle to pull up. The
engine started to pick up, then sputtered, then picked
up all right. I paid no attention to its sputtering. It
had done that when I took off from Kelly Field that
morning. It had done it when I had circled the field
at Corpus Christi on the Gulf. There was a dead
spot in the carburetor. The engine was all right. It
was airtight above or below that one spot on the
throttle. I continued to pull up. I went around and
dove low at the station again. Again I failed to read
the sign. I opened the throttle to pull up. The engine
started to pick up, then sputtered, then picked up
beautifully. I went around and dove at the station
again. I got it that time. It was Floresville, Tex. I
knew where that was. I opened the throttle to pull
up. The engine started to pick up, then sputtered,
then died. The prop stood still.
I swung my ship to the left. I held it up as much
as I dared. I headed toward the open space. I was
almost stalling. I barely cleared the last house. I was
dropping rapidly. I eased forward on the stick. No
response. I eased back. The nose dropped. I was
stalled. I was about ten feet above the ground. There
was a fence almost under me. Maybe I would clear it.
I heard a loud rending of wood and tearing of
fabric. I felt a sensation of being pummeled and
beaten. Something hit me in the face. Then I was
aware of an immense quietness.
I just sat there in the cockpit. The dust settled
slowly in the still air. The hot Texas sun filtered
through it. I still held the stick with my right hand.
My left hand was on the throttle. My feet were
braced on the rudder bar.
I was on a level with those fences. I stepped over
the side of the cockpit onto the ground. I looked at
the wreck. The wings and landing gear were a complete
Washout. The fuselage wasn’t damaged.
I looked into the gasoline tanks. The main tank
was empty. The reserve tank was full. I looked into
the cockpit at the gas valves. The main tank was
turned on. The reserve tank was turned off. I turned
the main tank off and turned the reserve tank on.
I phoned Kelly Field from a house near by.
An instructor flew down to get me. He landed his
ship and then walked over and looked at my ship.
He looked at the gas tanks. He looked in the cockpit
at the gas valves. He turned to me. His eyes
twinkled.
“What was the matter, wouldn’t your reserve tank
take?” he asked.
“No, sir, it wouldn’t take,” I lied.
“That’s the first tough luck you’ve had during the
course, isn’t it?” he asked.
“Yes,” I said. “I have never cracked up before.”
He flew me back to Kelly Field.



A POOR PROPHET
“What is the weather to New York?” I asked
the weather man at the air-mail field at Bellefonte,
Pa.
“Clear and unlimited all the way,” he told me.
I took off in my low-wing Lockheed Sirius at dark
and flew along the lighted beacons through the mountains.
Half an hour later I ran into broken clouds at
4,000 feet. I flew under them. Soon they became
solid and I couldn’t see the stars overhead. I saw
lightning ahead of me flashing in the darkness.
Water began to collect on my windshield. The air
got very rough. A beacon light that had been flashing
up ahead of me disappeared. I noticed the lights
of a town beneath me getting dim. For a second I
lost sight of them entirely. I nosed down to get out
of the clouds.
A brilliant flash of lightning lit the darkness
around me. I saw the rain driving in white sheets and
caught the flash of a beacon through it. I nosed down
toward the beacon and started circling it. I knew
by my altimeter that I was down lower than some of
the mountain ridges around me. I looked for the
next beacon but couldn’t see it through the raging
thunderstorm. I didn’t dare strike out in the general
direction of the next beacon in the hope of finding it.
I might hit a mountain top.
Another blinding flash of lightning surrounded
me with glaring light. I saw the dark bottoms of the
clouds and the black top of the next ridge I had to
pass over. Then blackness and the slashing rain with
only the friendly beacon under me.
I fought my way from beacon to beacon for an
hour. The lightning flashes receded farther and
farther behind me. I began to see from beacon to
beacon. Stars appeared overhead. They were very
dim. I was flying in a haze.
I passed over Hadley Field, New Jersey, and saw
its boundary lights burning cheerfully. I continued
on toward Roosevelt Field. I was almost home now.
I noticed the lights of the towns beneath me
getting dimmer. I looked up. The stars were gone. I
looked down again. The lights had disappeared!
I was flying blind in a thick fog. I began to fly by
instruments. I pulled up. At 3,000 feet I saw the
stars. I was on top of the fog.
I swung around to go back to Hadley Field. Its
lights were covered. I saw the lights of what I figured
was New Brunswick. I started circling them.
I knew Hadley Field was only a few miles from
there. The lights of New Brunswick began to blot
out. Hey, what the hell! I said out loud to myself.
I saw a segment of the rotating beam of a beacon
break through a hole in the fog and make about a
quarter of a turn in the darkness before it disappeared.
That’s the beam from Hadley beacon! I
was saying all my thoughts out loud now. I flew over
to where I figured the center of the beam was and
started circling. The top of the fog looked pretty
bright there. I decided that Hadley had heard me
and had turned on its floodlights.
I eased back on my throttle, settled into a spiraling
glide, and sank down into the fog, flying by
instruments. The opaque white fog got more and
more luminous. Individual bright spots, greatly
blurred, began to appear. I figured they were the
boundary lights of the field. My altimeter read very
low. I broke through the bottom of the fog at about
two hundred feet. I was over Hadley. I flew low into
the blackness back of the field and came around and
landed.
“What the hell are you flying in this stuff for?”
the Hadley weather man asked me.
“Because I was damned fool enough to take Bellefonte’s
weather report seriously,” I said.



TOO MUCH KNOWLEDGE
When I was in Cleveland at the air races a couple
of years ago four so-called flyers asked me to fly with
them in their Bellanca to the Sky Harbor airport
near Chicago. I agreed. We took off after the last
race with just enough gas to make the field nicely.
We hit a head wind, but I still figured we were okay.
I didn’t know where the field was, but one of the girls
in the plane had been taking instruction at Sky
Harbor and the other three claimed that they had
lived in Chicago all their lives and knew Sky Harbor
as well as their own mother.
When we got to Chicago it was already dark. I
followed instructions. We flew north. Someone yelled
I should turn east. I turned east. Someone else
shouted that was all wrong, we were already too far
east. I turned west. The next fifteen minutes were
bedlam. &quot;East, north, west, and south,&quot; they yelled.
I lost my temper. &quot;Do you or do you not know where
this field is?&quot; I exploded. &quot;There it is!&quot; they chorused.
I heaved a sigh of relief and got ready to land.
It wasn’t the field. I looked at my gas, and my gas
was too low. I took matters into my own hands and
flew back to the municipal airport and gassed up.
We started out again. The situation started to strike
me as funny as soon as the tanks were full. I let them
have their fun, and eventually they did find the field.
I called back to the girl who had been taking
instruction and asked if there were any obstructions around
the field. “Absolutely not!” she vowed. I looked the
field over as carefully as I could. There were no floodlights
(they had also told me the field was well
lighted). I cut the gun and glided in for a landing.
A high-tension post whizzed by my left ear. We had
missed the wires by just two inches. And there were
no obstructions around the field!



HIDDEN FAULTS
Nearly every time that a big money race comes
along a lot of new planes put in an appearance.
Some of them haven’t been properly tested (you can
get a special license for racing), and none of them
are the type you would want to give your grandmother
a ride in. But they are all fast, and when you
are flying in a race for money you want speed, a lot
of it.
I pulled up in front of the hangar late one summer
afternoon and saw a brand-new, speedy type
cantilever monoplane standing on the line. The wing
had large L-shaped gashes in it. The plane belonged
to Red Devereaux, who was going to fly it in the
National Air Race Derby. As I sat there Red came
over. He told me that on the way in from the factory
in Wichita a terrific wing flutter set in every time he
passed through rough air. The oscillations were so
bad that the stick would tear itself from Red’s hands.
He asked me to try it out and see if it were possible
to race the plane.
I put on my parachute and climbed in. As I
warmed the motor up I decided to have the door
taken off the ship. Easier to get out that way. I put
the ship in a shallow climb and held it to six thousand
feet. Feeling it out, I dived, banked, rolled, looped,
and spun it. It seemed to be fine. I landed and told
Red that everything was okay.
The next day diving over the Boston airport, in
the lead, the wing broke off. The plane plunged into

“DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY”
A friend of mine knew a doctor who had an old
skeleton. The skeleton wasn’t of any use to the
doctor. It had been hanging in a closet for almost a
year. I decided to have some fun with it. I wired the
head and jaws with fine wire. I attached two strings
to the wire in such a way that by pulling one I could
make the skeleton’s head turn left or right. When I
pulled the other the jaws clacked up and down. I tied
the skeleton in one of the dual-control seats of a
cabin Travelair. I flew the ship from the other seat.
By bending way down nobody from the outside could
see me. It looked as though the skeleton were doing
the flying. Jim Drummond, flying mechanic, lay on
the floor of the plane and took charge of the skeleton’s
behavior.
I knew that Eric Wood and Pete Brooks were flying
formation over Floyd Bennett Field that day.
They had just joined the army reserve corps and
were all steamed up trying to make a success out of
it. I decided they would be my first victims of the
day. We had no trouble finding the formation. There
was Pete just behind the leader, looking very conscientious
and pleased with himself. He was doing
everything just right. I eased up beside him. He
didn’t notice me for a second. When he glanced
around I gave Jim the signal. The skeleton looked
right in his face and jabbered. Horror and amazement
flooded Pete’s face. He turned back to the
formation—he had to unless he wanted to bump into
the other planes. But he couldn’t stand it for long.
He had to look again. Jabber, jabber, went the
skeleton. This went on a third and a fourth time,
till I finally felt sorry for Pete. He was getting walleyed,
one eye on the formation, the other on the
skeleton. I gave him one final superb jabber, dipped
my wings, and went in search of other game.



CONFESSION
Jimmie Doolittle has demonstrated American airplanes
all over the world. He landed on one of his
tours at Bandoeng, Java, headquarters of the Dutch
East Indian Air Corps. They had some American,
Conqueror-powered, Curtiss Hawks there. They
asked Jimmie to take one of them up and put on a
show for them.
After turning the ship inside out for the better
part of an hour, Jimmie really got into the spirit of
the thing. He decided to dive straight down from
about 6,000 feet and conclude the show by showing
them how close he could come to the ground, pulling
out of the dive.
He turned over and started down. Straight down,
closer and closer to the ground, wide open, he roared.
He yanked back on the stick to just clear the ground
and discovered there were several little considerations
he had overlooked. One was that he had just
stepped out f a Cyclone-powered Hawk, much
lighter than the Conqueror-powered one he was desperately
trying to clear the airport in at that moment.
The other was that he was accustomed to flying
the lighter ship out of a sea-level airport, much
heavier-aired than the 2,500-foot-high airport that
he was at that moment trying to avoid. The heavier
ship squashed in the thinner air and hit the ground
in the pull-out. Just kissed it and skimmed into the
air again.
Jimmie wondered if his landing gear had been
swiped off, came around, landed, and discovered
that it hadn’t.
The Dutch officers rushed out to him when he
crawled out of his cockpit. “My God, Jimmie,” they
chorused, slapping him on the back, “that was the
most delicate piece of flying we have ever seen!”
“Huh,” Jimmie grunted, still thinking how lucky
he had been to get away with it, “delicate piece of
flying, hell! That was the dumbest piece of flying
I ever did in my life!”
They knew it too, of course, despite the polite
way they had put it. So from then on Jimmie was
ace-high with them, because he had admitted the
boner instead of trying to lie out of it.



GONE ARE THE DAYS
George Weiss, one of the boys that kick the Daily
News photographic ship around into position for
the aërial photographs that appear in New York’s
picture paper, told me this funny one he experienced
with the late Commander Rogers of the navy:
Commander Rogers had flown way back in the
early days of Wright pushers. He saw George in
Washington several years ago and asked him if he
could fly him up to his home at Havre de Grace, Md.
He assured George that there was a field there right
beside his house that they could land in. He said
that he had landed in it himself.
George took him up in his Travelair cabin ship.
He arrived over the Commander’s house and the
Commander pointed out the field. “It’s full of cows,”
George objected. “That’s all right,” the Commander
told him, “just buzz the field a couple of times
and somebody will come out and chase the cows
away.”
George did, and sure enough somebody came out
and chased the cows off the field.
“I still can’t land there,” George remonstrated.
“The field is too small.”
“Sure you can,” the Commander assured him;
“I’ve done it.”
George circled the field again. He said it looked
like a good-sized pocket handkerchief to him and
was surrounded by tall trees.
“Are you sure you’ve landed there?” George insisted.
“Sure, I have,” the Commander reassured him.
“Go ahead, you can get in it.”
George thought to himself that if the Commander
had got in there, by golly, he could too. He said he
finally squashed down over the trees, falling more
than gliding, and dropped into the field with a smack
that should have cracked the ship up but didn’t. He
stopped fifty feet from the row of trees by standing
on his brakes and cutting the switches. He said he
didn’t know how the hell he was going to get out of
the place without dismantling the ship.
That night, in the Commander’s house, over a
drink, George asked him, “Come, now, Commander,
tell me the truth. Did you really land in that field?”
“Certainly I did,” the Commander said. “It was
back in 1912, and I was flying a Wright pusher.”
George sneezed into his drink. The Wright pushers
land so slow they can be flown off a dining-room
table.
“And do you remember those trees around the
field?” the Commander asked. George remembered.
“Well, they were only bushes in 1912.”



“LOOK WHO TAUGHT HER”
I was trying to teach my wife to fly. I thought every
flyer’s wife should know something about flying. It
would be so convenient on cross-country trips if Dee
could spell me off on the controls. I was having very
little success. In the first place, Dee’s eyes weren’t
good, which is a decided disadvantage, and in the
second place she just couldn’t seem to catch on. She
had no coördination. I sweated and struggled and
cursed. “Don’t skid on the turns,” I moaned. “The
rudder and the stick must be used together. If you
put the stick to the right, push the right rudder. If
you put the stick to the left, use the left rudder.”
And the ship would grind around on another skid.
Dee didn’t take her flying as seriously as I did.
She didn’t particularly want to learn to fly except
to please me. I thought if I could instill in her a sense
of shame at her lack of coördination maybe she would
improve. I picked a day when she was more than
usually bad. The plane had been in every conceivable
position but the right one. She had skidded and
slipped and wobbled all over the sky. My temper
was getting the best of me.
“Dee,” I said, “haven’t you any pride about learning
how to fly? Other women learn how. Look at all
the girls who fly, and fly damn well. Look at Anne
Lindbergh, for instance. She has been doing a wonderful
job on that Bird plane. She solos all over the
place, and she only took it up a little while ago.”
Dee looked at me a minute and said, “Well, look
who taught her.”
I gave up teaching my wife how to fly.



A FAULTY RESCUE
Eddie Burgin, one of the oldest pilots on Roosevelt
Field, tells me this one about how they used the last
remaining outdoor “outbuilding” on Roosevelt Field
as a homing device to lead a troubled pilot down into
the airport.
Russ Simpson, American flying instructor in the
Gosport School in England during the war and at
present an airplane broker on Roosevelt Field, took
off in one of the old Jennies to fly the first electric
sign ever flown over New York City at night. While
he was gone a ground fog rolled in over the airport.
Pretty soon the fellows on the ground heard him
coming back. They could hear his motor, but they
couldn’t see his ship. They knew he couldn’t see the
airport. He was stuck on top of the fog.
They decided to help him. They got cans of gasoline
and poured them on the old outbuilding which
stood a little way out from the hangars and set fire
to the rickety structure. They tore up all the spare
motor crates they could find and piled them on top
of the blaze. They got the fire so big they were afraid
for a while that the hangars were going to catch.
They were trying to make a red glow in the fog so
Russ could tell where the field was.
Finally they heard Russ’s motor cut. They heard
the ship glide in and heard it hit. They could tell
from the noise it made when it hit that it had
cracked up.
They jumped into a car and went rushing all over
the airport in the darkness and the fog looking
for the wreck. It took them half an hour to find it,
so Eddie says.
When they did, they found Russ sitting on top
of it, smoking a cigarette. Their almost burning
the hangars down had all been in vain. Russ hadn’t
seen any red glow at all. He had simply mushed
down through the stuff and hit the airport by luck.



HELPING THE ARMY
After I was graduated from Brooks and Kelly, the
army transferred me to Selfridge Field in Detroit.
There was nothing much doing around Selfridge,
and I was getting a little bored. I heard they were
giving an air show at Akron, right near my home
town. I thought it would be fun to go out there to
see my old friends and give a stunt exhibition. I got
the necessary permission from the higher-ups and
started out in a Tommy Morse. The Morse planes
were pretty near obsolete by that time, and the service
was trying to replace them as fast as possible
with newer models. There were only a few of them
left.
When I got to Akron there was a lot of excitement
going on over the air show. I told myself I was
going to give them the works—show them what a
local boy could do. The first part of my program
went off fine. I looped, barrel-rolled, dove, etc. I had
figured out a trick landing as the grand finale that
would pull the customers right out of their seats.
The landing didn’t turn out so well. I misjudged my
distance and ended up on one wing. It was pretty
humiliating. There was nothing to do but wire Selfridge
Field to ship me another wing. They wired
back to the effect that there were no more wings
available at the moment and that I should crate the
ship home. That stumped me. I had no idea how to
dismantle a plane. I studied the old Morse from every
angle, but I couldn’t find the solution. I had to get
the plane in a crate, and I had to do it quickly. I
used a saw. I sawed off the good wing, the damaged
wing, and the tail surfaces. I crammed them into a
crate and sent them on their way. The plane of
course had to be junked.
I had helped the army to get rid of one more
Tommy Morse.



APOLOGY
I was sitting alone in a movie not long ago. The
newsreel came on. Jimmie Doolittle’s capable but
impish face flashed upon the screen. Behind him
was the fast, low-wing, all-metal Vultee plane in
which he had just failed to better by more than a
few minutes the Los Angeles—New York record for
transport planes.
“I’m sorry I didn’t make faster time,” his picture
spoke. “I didn’t do justice to the ship I flew. I wandered
off my course during the night and hit the
coast 200 miles south of where I should have hit it.
It was just another piece of bum piloting.”
I saw Jimmie in Buffalo not long after that.
“What was the matter, Jimmie?” I asked him,
referring to the flight he had spoken about in the
newsreel. “Were you on top of the stuff for a long
time?” I continued, generously implying that of
course he had had enough bad weather to force him
to fly on top of the clouds and out of sight of land
for so much of the trip that naturally he got off his
course.
“No,” he explained, “I wasn’t on top. I was in it
for ten and a half hours. I couldn’t get on top because
I picked up ice above sixteen thousand feet.
I couldn’t go under for several reasons. I had high
mountains to clear. I would have made even slower
time and run out of gas before I got to New York
if I had flown low, because my supercharged engine
required 15,000 feet to develop its full power and
its most efficient gas consumption. So I had to fly in
it. Also I got mixed up on some radio beams. Some
of them are stronger than others. I figured the
strongest ones the closest, which wasn’t always true.
I learned a lot on that trip. I think I could hit it on
the nose the next time.”
He was talking shop to a fellow professional. I
could immediately see that 200 miles off under the
conditions he had had to contend with had not been
bad at all. I wouldn’t have blamed him if he had explained
to the public a little more than he did. But
when he said to them, without the shadow of an
alibi, “It was just another piece of bum piloting,” I
thought it was pretty swell.



I AM DEAD
This is the testament of Jimmy Collins, the test
pilot.
It is, as he himself phrased it, “The word of my
life and my death. The dream word that breathed
into my nostrils the breath of life and destroyed me
too.”
The body of Jimmy Collins was found on Friday
in Pinelawn Cemetery, near Farmingdale, L. I., beneath
the wreckage of the Grumman ship he had
tested for the navy. That body was broken, mangled,
twisted, in a 10,000-foot crash.
His testament, the utterance of a poet who flew,
first in search of beauty, then in search of bread, is
bravely, lyrically alive, straight and whole, as was
the spirit of the man who wrote it.
He wrote it—laughingly, he said; grimly, we believe—nine
months ago. This is how it happened:
In October Collins went to Buffalo to test a new
Curtiss bomber-fighter for the navy. Before he left
he took dinner with his old friend Archer Winsten,
who conducts the In the Wake of the News column
for the Post. Winsten wrote a column about Collins
and his spectacular job, begged the flyer to do a
guest column for him on his return, telling of the
Buffalo feat.
What happened after that is best told in Collins’s
own words.
He wrote to his sister, out West: “I got to thinking
it over and thought maybe I wouldn’t come back
because it was a dangerous job, and then poor
Archer would be out of a column.... So I playfully
wrote one for him in case I did get bumped off.
Thoughtful of me, don’t you think?... I never
got bumped off. Too bad, too, because it would have
been a scoop for Arch....”
Last Friday’s job was to have been Jimmy’s last
as a test pilot. He took it because he needed the
money, for his wife and children. Soon he was to have
started on a writer’s career.
Jimmy’s writing career ends today with his testament.
He prefaced it with the following:
“The next words you read will be those of James
H. Collins, and not ‘as told to,’ although you might
say ghost-written.”
I AM DEAD.
How can I say that?
Do you remember an old, old story? I shall tell
you just the beginning of it: “In the beginning was
the word, and the word was God....” That’s
enough for you to see what I mean.
It is by the word that I can say that.
Not by the spoken word. I cannot say to you by
the spoken word, “I am dead.”
But there is not only the spoken word. There is
also the written word. It has different dimensions
in space and time.
It is by the written word that I can say to you, “I
am dead.”
But there is not only the spoken and the written
word. There is also the formless, unbreathed word of
mood and dream and passion. This is the word that
must have been the spirit of God that brooded over
the face of the deep in the beginning. It is the word
of life and death.
It was the word of my life and my death. The
dream word that breathed into my nostrils the breath
of life and destroyed me too.
Dreams. And life. And death.
I had a dream. Always I had a dream. I cannot
tell you what that dream was. I can only tell you
that flying was one of its symbols. Even when I was
very young that was true. Even as long as I can remember.
When I became older, it became even more true.
So deep a dream, so great a passion, could not be
denied.
Finally I did fly.
“Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy
youth, when the evil days drew not nigh....” Part
of the same old story.
I remembered the dream of the days of the youth
of my flying, that burst of glory, and how the world
and my shining youth itself shone with the radiance
of it.
It was my creator. It created life for me, for man
shall not live by bread alone. Man cannot. Only his
dreams and his vision sustain him.
But the evil days drew nigh. The glow died down,
and the colors of the earth showed up. Ambition,
money. Love and cares and worry. Curious how
strong the strength of weakness is, in women and
their children, when you can see your own deep
dreams, unworded, shining in their eyes. I grew
older too, and troublous times beset the world.
Finally there came a time when I would rather
eat than fly, and money was a precious thing.
Yes, money was a precious thing, and they offered
me money, and there was still a small glow of the
deep, strong dream.
The ship was beautiful. Its silver wings glistened
in the sun. Its motor was a strong song that lifted it
to high heights.
And then...
Down.
Down out of the blue heights we hurtled. Straight
down. Faster. Faster and faster. Testing our
strength by diving.
Fear?
Yes, I had grown older. But grim fear now. The
fear of daring and courage. But tempered too with
some of the strong power of the old dream now
too.
Down.
Down.
A roar of flashing steel and a streak of glinting ... oh
yes, oh yes, now ... breaking wings. Too
frail ... the wings ... the dream ... the evil
days.
The cold but vibrant fuselage was the last thing
to feel my warm and living flesh. The long loud diving
roar of the motor, rising to the awful crashing
crescendo of its impact with the earth, was my death
song.
I am dead now.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
