PREFACE


Another year, and we are still at War! But
we must not mind, for we must see this thing
through to the end. As Mr. Oliver said in
his letter on "What we are fighting for,"
published this week: "We are fighting for
Restitution, Reparation, and Security, and the
greatest of these is Security." He means security
that this horror shall not happen again, and that
these crimes shall not again be committed; and
he adds: "To get this security we must destroy
the power of the system which did these things."

Now it is clear that this power is not yet
destroyed, and to make peace while it lasts is to
betray our dead, and to leave it to the children
still in the cradle to do the work over again, if,
indeed, it will be possible for them to do it if
we in our generation fail.

[viii]

This book, then, is an answer to the question
asked me very often during the past two years,
and very pointedly from the trenches this very
Christmas Day: "How can you reconcile your
belief in a good God, who is also powerful,
with the continuance of this desolating War?
How can we still believe the Christian message
of Peace on earth with War all around?"

It is with the hope that this book may
comfort some mourning hearts, and bring some
light to doubting minds, that I send forth
"The Potter and the Clay."

THE POTTER'S VESSEL[1]



"Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I
will cause thee to hear My words. Then I went down to the
potter's house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels.
And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand
of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed
good to the potter to make it."&mdash;Jer. xviii. 2-4.


I suppose there is no metaphor in Holy Scripture
that has been so much misunderstood and
led to more mischief than this metaphor of
the potter and the clay. Do not you know
how, if any of us dared to vindicate the ways
of God to men, again and again we were
referred to the words of St. Paul: "Who art
thou that repliest against God? Shall the
thing formed say to Him that formed it: Why[4]
hast Thou made me thus? Hath not the
potter power over the clay, of the same lump
to make one vessel unto honour, and another
unto dishonour?" And so the offended human
conscience was silenced but not satisfied.
There is no doubt that the monstrous misrepresentation
of Christianity which we call
Calvinism arose chiefly from this metaphor;
and few things have done more harm to the
religion of the world than Calvinism. Those
who believe that God is an arbitrary tyrant
who simply works as a potter is supposed to
work on clay, irrespective of character or any
plea for mercy&mdash;how can such a person love
God, or care for God, or wish to go to church
or even pray? You cannot do it!

Thus there sprang up in some men's minds
just such a picture of God as is described by
that wonderful genius, Browning. Some of
you may have read the poem called "Caliban
on Setebos," in which the half-savage Caliban
pictures to himself what sort of a person God
is. He had never been instructed, he knew
nothing; but he imagined that God would
act towards mankind as he acted towards the[5]
animals and the living creatures on his island;
and this is a quotation from that poem:


"Thinketh, such shows nor right nor wrong in Him.
Nor kind, nor cruel: He is strong and Lord.
Am strong myself compared to yonder crabs
That march now from the mountain to the sea;
Let twenty pass, and stone the twenty-first,
Loving not, hating not, just choosing so.
Say the first straggler that boasts purple spots
Shall join the file, one pincer twisted off?
Say, this bruised fellow shall receive a worm,
And two worms he whose nippers end in red;
As it likes me each time, so I do: so He."


In other words, his picture of God was
that of an arbitrary tyrant who rejoiced in
his power, who did what he liked, who enjoyed
tormenting, who would have looked down in
glee upon the pictures that have so touched us
in the paper of a woman, as she taught a Bible-class,
killed by a Zeppelin bomb; and most
touching of all of the little child who, with the
stump of his arm, ran in and said: "They've
killed daddy and done this to me." These
things stir our deepest feelings; but such a
God as Caliban pictured his Setebos to be
would have rejoiced at them and laughed to
see them.

[6]

No wonder that this picture of God which
has grown up in some minds produces absolute
despair. People say, "If God is like that,
what is the good of my doing anything?
God will do what He likes, irrespective of
what I do." Or, again, it produces a spirit of
fatalism: "I'm made like that! It's not my
fault." Like Aaron when reproached about
the golden calf&mdash;"I cast the gold they gave
me into the fire, and there came out this
calf." And all this produces in the mind of
mankind a kind of rebellion&mdash;nay, a hatred of
God ("I hate God," said a man once to me)&mdash;which
makes it quite impossible for any religion
or trust or desire to pray to exist in the human
soul. It is well worth while, then, to run this
metaphor of the potter and the clay back to
its source.

Here in Jeremiah is the original passage
about the potter and the clay. Now if you read
for yourself this passage in the eighteenth
chapter of Jeremiah, you will find an absolutely
different picture given. If you go with
Jeremiah to the potter's house you find a
humble, patient man at work dealing with[7]
refractory clay, patiently trying to make the
best he can out of it, and when he is defeated
in producing one object he makes another.
If he cannot make a porcelain vase he will make
a bowl; if he cannot produce a beautiful
work of art he makes a flower-pot.

The potter has three things to notice about
him. First of all, there is his patience. Then
there is the fact that he is checked in his
design by the clay at every moment. He has
no arbitrary power; he is checked because he
has to deal with a certain substance. And
the last beautiful thing about the potter is
his resourcefulness; he has always got the
alternative of a second best. Though something
has wrecked his first plan he has got
another. This is the picture of God, these
are the characteristics of God which we are
to carry away from the potter and the clay.

1. Now just see, if this is so, what a
tremendous light this throws upon the war.
There are many to-day who do not think things
out deeply, who look on this war as the breakdown
of Christianity altogether. They say:
All we have been taught, why, look how vain[8]
it is! Here are seven Christian nations at
war and dragging in the rest of the world.
All you have taught us about God, all you say
about Christianity, is shown to be futile.
We see the breakdown of Christianity indeed.

But wait a moment. Look at the potter
and the clay, and see if you do not get some light
from this. Here is the Potter, our great
God; the great Potter knows what is in His
mind; He has in His mind a world of universal
peace. He is planning a porcelain vase in
which the world is at peace. He meant men
to be all of one mind. He made people of
one blood to be of one mind in Christ Jesus.
That is clearly His plan, His design, and we
do well to pray for&mdash;


"... the promised time
When war shall be no more,
And lust, oppression, crime,
Shall flee Thy face before."


That is His plan, that is His design, and some
day He will see it accomplished. "He shall
see of the travail of His soul and shall be
satisfied."

Meanwhile, because He acts like a potter,[9]
He is defeated again and again by the character
of the clay, for He will not run counter to
the free will of the individual or of a nation.
If a great and powerful nation deliberately
turns back from Christianity to Paganism, if
that nation deliberately declares regret that
it took up Christianity in the fourth century,
if it has adopted the gospel that Might is Right,
if the people turn to Odin as their ideal instead
of to Christ, they defeat the plan of the great
Potter; and so He cannot have the porcelain
vase of universal peace. You have no right
to blame God; it is the work of the Devil.
God is hindered at every moment by the Devil
and all his works; you cannot therefore blame
our great and glorious God for the defeat of
His design. The great Potter is not to be
blamed because of the refractoriness of the clay.

But here comes the splendid resourcefulness
of the great Potter. Although He cannot get
out His first design of the porcelain vase of
universal peace, He is not defeated. He has
got a second-best; He will have a beautiful
bowl of universal service&mdash;a people offering
themselves out of sheer patriotism for the[10]
service of their country. And that is what
He has produced to-day. Who would have
thought that five millions of men would have
volunteered to fight for their country? Who
would have thought that every woman would
feel herself disgraced if not doing something
for her country as nurse, physician, or in
a canteen? Why, the spirit of service abroad
to-day among men and women is something
we have not seen in our country for a hundred
years. The great Potter, then, has produced
something from the clay; He has produced
the beautiful bowl of service. Let us thank
Him for that!

2. But it is not only upon the war that
the picture of the potter and the clay throws
such light; it also shows what we have to do
with our country. There are some people
who imagine it is inconsistent to say two things
at the same time. People blame me for
declaring two things in the same breath. One
is that we never have had such a righteous
cause; that we are fighting for the freedom of
our country, for the freedom of the world;
that we are fighting for international honour,[11]
for the future brotherhood of nations; we
are fighting for the "nailed hand against the
mailed fist." But, on the other hand, are we
to speak as if we had no faults of our own?
Are we to take the tone of Pharisees and say,
"We thank God we are not as other men,
even as these Germans"? We have to
admit that we have grave national sins ourselves,
and if we want to shorten the war we
have to put these national sins away. That is
why we are going to have a national mission
this autumn, and we are preparing for it
now.

The Church is going to preach this great
national mission, and&mdash;please God&mdash;our Non-conformist
brethren will fall in on their own
lines and do the same. We have great national
sins, and we have to put those away if we would
shorten the war. What a disgrace it is still
to have a National Drink Bill of 180 millions!
What a disgrace it is that we have not yet more
thoroughly mastered immorality in London!
What shame it is that still there is so much
love of comfort, and that there are people
making all they can out of the war!

[12]

We have to get rid of all this; we must have
the spirit of sacrifice from one end of the nation
to the other. We have to ask the great Potter
to remake the country, to give the Empire a
new spirit. Why was it that, when I had myself
pressed a Bill to diminish the licensing hours
on Sunday from six to three&mdash;a harmless reform,
you would have thought&mdash;to give the
barmen and barmaids a chance of Sunday rest,
that was shelved in the long run? Why was it
that we could not raise the age for the protection
of girls even to eighteen? There is
much to be purged out of our country, and
there could be no greater calamity than for this
war to end and England still to be left with
her national sins.

Therefore the great Potter must remake us.
He may have to break some nations to pieces
like a potter's vessel. It is possible for a
nation to be so stiffened in national sins that
there may be nothing for it but to break it in
pieces. We pray God that we may not be
so far gone as that, that we may still be plastic
clay in the hands of the Potter. That is
our prayer, that is our ideal, to be a new[13]
England, a new British Empire, and that God
may use us as His instrument in freeing the
world.

3. But&mdash;and let this be my last word&mdash;we
ourselves individually must be re-created.
Have you ever thought, brother or sister, that
the great Potter had a design for you? That,
when He planned you, He planned a devoted
man who would be a powerful influence in
the world; that He planned you, my sister,
to be an example of attractive goodness.
How many people have you brought to
Christ? How powerful a witness do you
give in this city? Suppose that you, who were
meant individually to be powerful instruments
in God's hand, vessels He could use, have
become middle-aged cynics, or sneer at the
religion you profess to believe in, there is only
one thing to be done. You must get back to the
design the great Potter had for you. We have
all some reason to admit that we have been
marred in the hands of the Potter, and to ask
the Potter to make us into another vessel as it
may seem good to the Potter to make us. In
this there are only two conditions&mdash;to look[14]
up and to trust heaven's wheel and not earth's
wheel.


"Look not thou down, but up!
To uses of a cup,
The festal board, lamp's flash and trumpet's peal,
The new wine's foaming flow,
The master's lips aglow!
Thou, heaven's consummate cup, what needst thou with earth's wheel?"[2]


We have to realise this, that we can be remade,
that God's power can do anything;
but that we may go on for ever as we are unless
we really put ourselves in the hands of God.
What, then, I ask every one of you, is to
take the clay of your nature with the prayer,
"Just as I am, without one plea," and place
it in the great Potter's hands, that He may
re-create you into the man or woman God
meant you to be. Nothing can more effectually
shorten the days for our boys in the
trenches.



[15]




II

THE SPLENDOUR OF GOD



"O God, wonderful art Thou in Thy holy places: Thou
wilt give strength and power unto Thy people. Blessed
be God."&mdash;Ps. lxviii. 35.


At the great Convention of all the clergy of
London in Advent, 1915, we saw reasons for
thinking that what the world had been losing
sight of was the majesty of God; the lowered
sense of sin, the neglect of worship, the uppishness
of man, the pessimism of the day, and the
querulous impatience under discomfort, are
all signs of the loss of the sense of the majesty
of God.

But I want now to go farther than this;
I want to prove that the only way to revive
praise, hope, peace, sacrifice, and courage,
is to revive a belief, not only in the majesty, but
in the splendour of God. It was said not long[16]
ago that even good Christians believed all the
Creed except the first clause of it.

But if we leave out the first clause, "I
believe in God," see what happens.

1. Prayer becomes unreal. It is only a
delight when it is felt to be communion with
a very noble and splendid person.


"Lord, what a change within us one short hour
Spent in Thy presence can prevail to make!"[3]


is only true if that short and glorious hour is
spent with an inspiring and glorious personality.
When, like Moses, our faces should shine as
we come down from the mount.

2. Praise becomes practically impossible.
Sometimes we say, "We really must praise
God more." But we cannot make ourselves
praise, any more than we can move a boat by
swinging up and down in it. We must pull
against something to make it move. What we
want is an adequate idea of the splendour of
God. When we come in sight of Mont
Blanc or Niagara, or when we hear of some
gallant deed on the battlefield, we say
"How splendid!" quite naturally. We shall[17]
praise quite naturally when we catch sight&mdash;if
only for a moment&mdash;of the true character
of God, or believe He has done something
great.

3. Religion, which means something which
binds us to God, becomes an uninspiring series
of detailed scruples about ourselves. Self-examination
is most necessary; but it was well
said by an experienced guide of souls that,
"for every time we look at ourselves, we ought
to look nine times at God."

Do some of you feel as I speak that your
religion does not help you; that, while you
have not given up your prayers, or coming to
church, it is rather a burden than a help, or
at any rate not such a help as it might be?
It is because you have lost sight of the splendour
of God.

4. Or, again, are you suffering from depression?
You hardly know why, but everything
seems to go wrong; you seem oppressed with
what old writers called "accidie." Your
will has lost its spring; the note of your life
has lost its hope and its joyousness. You drag
through life rather than "rise up with wings[18]
like an eagle" or "run," or even "walk."
This is all because you have lost faith or never
had faith in the splendour of God.

5. Or, on the contrary, you are busy from
morning till night, and you are too busy for
prayer or church; you are immersed in a thousand
schemes for making money for yourself
or for your family or for the good of mankind.
And yet, with all your business abilities,
you don't inspire people; you are conscious of
a want yourself, and other people are more
conscious of it. It is simply that you are without
the one thing which matters; you are
the planet trying to shine without its sun;
you are ignoring the splendour of God.

I. For consider how splendid God is!
These writers of the psalms had many limitations.
They had a very inadequate belief
in the life after the grave; they knew nothing
about the Incarnation; they had no Christmas
Day, Easter Day, Ascension Day, or Whit
Sunday, to inspire them. But they are bursting
with glorious song, because of their sense of
the splendour of God. "Before the mountains
were brought forth, or ever the earth and the[19]
world were made, Thou art God from everlasting,
and world without end."

1. He is splendid, first, in His wonderful
Power. I should not think of arguing with
you as to the existence of God; although, to
any thinking mind, the marvellous intricacy
of the whole creation, from the largest sun
to the smallest insect, demands a Thinking
Mind; the thunder of the four hundred
million consciences of mankind demands a
Righteous Person. And a Creator who is
at once wise and good is a God. No! it
is not only His existence which should mean
so much to us, but His astonishing power.

I remember when I was at Niagara being
taken down to the great power-station, and
through that power-station the power of
Niagara Falls lighted, among other things,
the whole of the great province of Ontario
so that the solitary worker in some small
town was working with the light from a great
power-station which he had never seen, and
in which he only, perhaps, partly believed.

But think of the Power-Station which works
the whole universe; which gives the light to[20]
twenty million suns which have been counted
and God knows how many which have never
been seen, and yet which gives strength to the
boy far from home as he leaps across the
parapet into the battle. Well may another
psalmist cry: "O God, wonderful art Thou
in Thy holy places: Thou shalt give strength
and power unto Thy people. Blessed be God."

And, surely, even if there were no other
characteristic of the splendour of God, this
ought to encourage us more than it does. To
believe that in prayer you are in touch with
unfathomable strength; that if you co-operate
with God you have at your disposal His unrivalled
and incomparable power&mdash;this ought
to put heart into the most timid. We understand
what Archbishop Trench meant when
he said:


"We kneel how weak; we rise how full of power!"


2. But the power of God is really only the
beginning of it. The next characteristic of
the splendour of God is in His Generosity.
"Thou openest Thine Hand, and fillest all
things living with plenteousness," says the
psalmist. You could scarcely get a more[21]
beautiful description of the open-handedness
of God, and the ease with which God showers
His gifts upon the world.

(a) When you come to think of it, there is no
explanation of man's possession of life, except
the open-handedness of God. He simply gave
him life, and there is nothing more to be said
about it. It is at present still a scientific
truth that "Life only comes from life." Life
has never been yet spontaneously generated.
When men thought they had succeeded in
creating life, it was discovered that some
previous germ of life had been left in the
hermetically sealed vessel. But even if, in
the years to come, some sort of life was produced
from apparently dead matter, would it
really have any bearing on the age-long belief
that this free, joyous life of man and animal
has come from God? When you ask why
He gave life, there is only one answer: That
so many more living, sentient beings might
sun themselves in the sunshine of His own
happiness, He opened His Hand and life came
out.

(b) But He was not content with giving life.[22]
He gave all the colour of life; He painted
the most glorious world out of the riches of
His marvellous imagination; every variety of
flower; every plumage of bird; every species
of tree&mdash;often brought to the best by the
slow process of evolution. He gave it all; He
flung it out in all the exuberance of delight
in what was "very good." He gave colour
to our own life. He gave us our warm friendships;
our keen intellectual interest in problems;
the love of mother, wife, husband, father,
child. He flung it all out, like a joyous
giver; "He filled all things living with plenteousness."

(c) But not content with this life, He had
another ready when this was over. He knew
the boys wanted life, and that this life would
not be enough to satisfy them, especially if
they died early; so He had another ready for
them. And here, again, another psalmist
dashes in with his word of praise: "He asked
life of Thee, and Thou gavest him a long life,
even for ever."

This is our glorious hope to-day. It is only
when we have grasped the splendour of the[23]
generosity of God that we can really appraise
the meanness of man.

Nearly all the ills of our life on earth&mdash;the
poverty, the class hatred, the wars&mdash;come
from an unfair grasping at an unfair share of
the gifts of the generous God.


"They ask no thrones; they only ask to share
The common liberty of earth and air,"


some poet sang of the gipsies.

God gave plenty of land, and plenty of
water, and plenty of air, and if the New
Testament motto had been followed, "Having
food and raiment, with these we shall have
enough," the generosity of God would have
been mirrored in the generosity of man.

3. But even this marvellous power and
generosity would not excite the passionate
love of mankind, but for His Humility.
Power may only awe; the merely generous
Lord or Lady Bountiful, kind as they often
are, are sometimes felt to do it in a spirit of
patronage and self-pleasing; they like to be
thought bountiful and kind, and have their
reward in the grateful looks and even obsequious
demeanour of the recipients of their[24]
bounty. But it is Christmas which really
stirs the blood. That this powerful, generous
Being should manifest His power and shower
down His gifts was wonderful; but that He
should give Himself&mdash;this was sublime! This
is what stirred heaven to its depths&mdash;"Glory
to God in the highest!"

The crowning splendour of God was His
Humility. He was great when He said, "Let
there be light, and there was light." He was
mighty when He opened His Hand and filled
all things living with plenteousness. But He
was greatest of all when He lay as a babe in
the manger. Well may the adoring Christian
look up at Christmas and salute this third
revelation of the splendour of God:


"Thou didst leave Thy throne and Thy kingly crown
When Thou camest to earth for me....
Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus:
There is room in my heart for Thee!"


II. What, then, ought this belief in the
splendid power, generosity, and humility of
God to produce in us?

1. It must produce Praise. It must make[25]
us say: "Praise God in His holiness; praise
Him in the firmament of His power."

You have caught sight of Mont Blanc and
you have seen Niagara, and you say quite
naturally, "How splendid!"

2. It produces Hope. War, slaughter,
misery, can't be the end, if such a God exists.
It may be inevitable from man's lust, ambition,
and greed; but it can't be the end&mdash;if God's
people work with God: there must be a kingdom
coming at last in which dwelleth, not
ambition, tyranny, or cruelty, but "righteousness,
peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost."

3. It produces Peace. Once believe in the
splendour of God, and you get "the peace of
God, which passeth all understanding."
"Thou wilt keep him," says the prophet, "in
perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on Thee."
The world is not out of God's Hand, as some
people would persuade us, nor any individual
in the world. "The very hairs of your head
are all numbered," and "ye are of more value
than many sparrows."

4. And it produces answering Sacrifice and
Courage. What we want to-day is "the[26]
warrior's mind," which gives and does not
heed the cost, which fights and does not heed
the wounds; and we can only be nerved for
this by the splendid self-sacrifice of God
Himself.

If man is God's child, then it must be a case
of "Like Father, like son," and the splendour of
God must be answered by the nobility of man.
To know such a God is to live, to serve such
a God is to reign; with such a faith, death loses
its sting, and the grave its terrors. For to
die is to pass into the presence of One who has
shown Himself powerful and generous and
humble. And the response of the grateful
soul, with ten times the conviction of the
psalmist, when he thinks of what happened
on Christmas Day, will be the same words
uttered so many thousand years ago:

"O God, wonderful art Thou in Thy
holy places.... He will give strength and
power unto His people. Blessed be God."

III

GOD THE KING OF THE WORLD[4]



"God is my King of old; the help that is done upon
earth He doeth it Himself."&mdash;Ps. lxxiv. 12.


God is either non-existent or His existence is
the greatest fact in the universe. Either the
secularist is right, and there is nothing but
the strong hand and the keen brain of man and
woman to better the condition of world,
or, if there be a Person who created the great
blazing suns that we call stars, whose imagination
is so vast that He controls the movements
of history, and yet whose knowledge is so
detailed that the welfare of the smallest child
in a great city is of infinite interest to Him,
then the existence of that Person is the greatest[28]
fact in all the world. No question is so urgent
as what He thinks about a problem; nothing is
so vitally important as to know what His mind
is, for instance, as to the issue of a great war.
No one is quite so foolish as the man or woman
who either plans his or her own life, or who
propounds schemes for the improvement of
the world, without taking the greatest Fact in
all the world into account, or keeping in touch
with what must be on this hypothesis the ultimate
Source and Fount of all power and the
Mainspring of all energy. If there be such
a Person at all, the wires might as well expect
to convey a message apart from the electric
current as for the human instrument to avail
without God.

Now, I think it is quite likely that among
so many busy people, whose brains are all full
of practical schemes, there may be some whose
minds may have but little hold on God, and
may be troubled by doubts, such as I remember
my own mind was in the days of
my youth. After all, one mind is very much
like another; and in speaking to women I
have long learnt to speak as if I was speaking[29]
to men, and in this I never found myself
very much astray. If I tell you, then, how
the reality of God gradually dawned upon one
mind, it is only in the hope that through what
may be similar clouds of vagueness and doubt
the light may shine upon another.

1. I think undoubtedly that Nature was,
and always will be to most minds, the first
help. It does seem more and more impossible
that the ordered universe can have been
produced by chance. To use an illustration
I have often used, especially on Sunday afternoons
at the open-air meetings in the parks
of East London, if a box of letters cannot
throw themselves into a play of Shakespeare
because there is clearly the mark of mind in
the play, how little credible is it that the atoms
of the universe have thrown themselves into
the universe as we see it to-day! We feel
inclined to add to the trenchant questions in
the Book of Job the further question: Who
wrapped the atmosphere round the earth and
made life possible, and stopped the friction?
Was the beauty of the earth the surprise,
or the gift to His children of a Being with[30]
a beautiful mind? Can the ordered course
of the silent stars be produced by any
amount of juggling with chance out of the
atoms of the world? In other words, Nature
drives us not only to God, but to a very
strong God and a very present God. If
the great astronomer Herschel is right, and
every atom has the appearance of a created
thing and every law of Nature requires, as he
says, the continual application of force, we
are "up against"&mdash;to use a cant phrase of the
day&mdash;we are up against the most powerful
Person the world has ever known. To swing
the smallest planet on its orbit is beyond the
power of the greatest superman ever present
to the brain of a megalomaniac. But to swing
twenty millions of blazing suns, and to swing
them every day and every night, and to swing
them, as far as we know, for millions of years,
requires a Person of surpassing strength and
most present power, for it is clear that of this
wonderful thing which is done upon earth
every day and every night "He doeth it
Himself."

2. But if the philosopher Kant was right[31]
in saying that the first thing which filled him
with awe was the starry heavens without, he
went on to say that the second was the moral
law within. And if the minds of you women
are like my own, the path of the discovery of
God lies next through the conscience. What
is it, this indistinct knocking, this voice, which
though it can be stilled can never be silenced?
If it is only a product of mingled self-interest
and heredity, as some would uphold, why does
it persistently urge us, sometimes in almost
bitter tones, against our immediate self-interest?

Why must the boy leave his brilliant
prospects and put himself under the bullets
and shells in the trenches? Why must the
mother let him go? It is only a shallow
thinker, I believe, who can remain long under
the impression that the "categorical imperative,"
as Kant called it, or, as we might say,
this insistent, imperious voice, can be produced
by any process of evolution at all. It speaks
like the voice of a person; it argues like a
person; it refuses to be silenced like a person.
And the argument is more than justified that,[32]
if there is a Person who made the world and
still carries it on, it is more than probably
the same Person who is speaking to us in
conscience. The fact that by His warnings
and encouragements He clearly cares so much
for righteousness is a standing witness that
the Person who swings the stars is more than
a strong and clever devil, which the author
of the material universe alone might conceivably
be, but a Person with a passion for
goodness. Otherwise, as Dr. Chalmers said,
He would not have placed in the breast of
every one of His children, of every one of His
created beings, a reclaiming witness against
Himself.

We have come, then, a good way out of
sceptical vagueness when we have arrived at a
Person of appalling power, and yet of equally
appalling righteousness, who is thundering His
will through every conscience in the world, as
though standing in the midst of the universe
and striking at the same time four hundred
million gongs; not leaving it for someone else
to do, but doing it Himself.

But, alas! we are still far from loving Him,[33]
for indeed He is still far from being lovable.
Love is the only thing which we cannot command
at will and which we cannot give at will;
and the world would be in a sorry plight so
far as loving God is concerned, if nothing
more had been done by God than this.

3. After all, there are many things which
might make us inclined to hate this immensely
strong and righteous Person. With all His
strength and with all His righteousness, there
is a terrible amount of suffering in the world.
The old question that some of your children
may have asked you who are mothers has far
more in it than appears upon the surface:
"Oh, mother, why does not God kill the
devil?" The world is filled with injustice
and cruelty, and especially so to-day. Ypres
Cathedral and the Cloth Hall, as I have seen
with my own eyes, are in ruins. So are
thousands of homes in Belgium, France, and
Poland, and yet not one single thing was done
by the innocent inhabitants to deserve this
fate. Who is going to give life again to the
hundreds shot in cold blood in Louvain and
Aerschott and elsewhere, and seen shot by one[34]
of the clergy of the diocese of London; or
honour again to the outraged women and
girls; or restore the dead children&mdash;born and
unborn&mdash;to the mothers who lost their children
in the last Zeppelin raid? Where is the God
of the fatherless and of the widow? It is all
very well to say, "It is God in His holy habitation."
But why does He sit up there in His
holy habitation while such things are being
done upon earth? Is He reclining, as Tennyson
pictured the ancient gods,


"On the hills, like gods together,
Careless of mankind"?


He may stay there; but if He does, who is
going to love Him? Whom do we love in
England to-day? Is our popular hero the
man who, while he remains safe in the shelter
of his home, suggests that someone else should
go and do something to save the country?
For myself, if I thought God was like that,
I should not love Him. Browning, with that
piercing insight which has helped so many,
puts the matter in a sentence. Is it possible,
he asks in that great argument contained in
the poem "Saul,"

[35]



"Here the parts shift,
Here the creature surpasses the Creator?"


"Would I suffer for him that I love?" cries
David, as he looks with love and pity on
stricken Saul. "Would I suffer for him that
I love? So wouldest Thou, so wilt Thou."
And it is an argument that no petty quibbles
can affect. For instance, if the boys in the
trenches every day and every night so give
their lives for their friends; if the mother
every day so loves the world that she gives
her only begotten son, and God either cannot
or will not, then man is greater than
God; then the creature surpasses the Creator;
the parts in the great drama have changed
indeed.

And that brings us straight up to the New
Testament, expecting the very story&mdash;yes,
asking for the very chapters&mdash;to carry on the
great witness of Nature and of conscience.
And there we find the story just as we should
expect, only more so. To use Archbishop
Temple's phrase, the character depicted in
the New Testament educates our conscience
instead of merely satisfying it. It is a more[36]
glorious exhibition of the character of God
than we had any right to ask, and all carried
out personally by Himself. The help that
was brought to earth, He brought it Himself.
And just as, on a gloomy day, when
bright sunshine bursts through clouds, it
changes everything, so this revelation changes
everything. It does not do away with difficulties;
it lights them up. It does not do
away with suffering, but lights it up. It is
quite another thing to suffer or to see suffering
if God suffered. "Then I can feel the
bullet tear out my eyes and still believe," as
a young officer to whom this happened still
believes. It does not do away with the crime
of the men who have wantonly produced this
unnecessary war, and who have trampled
underfoot every law of chivalry and humanity
in carrying it out. But it does give great
inspiration to those who die for what has been
called the nailed hand against the mailed
fist. "As Christ died for the salvation of
the world, my two boys have died according
to their lights for the same cause. May I
not think"&mdash;asked a Colonel who lost both[37]
his sons in one week&mdash;"that Christ counts
them as His comrades in arms?"

And what that thought did for him it will
do for others. It does not do away with the
inequalities of human life, but like a trumpet
note it summons every man and woman to
come and rally round Him who sprang into
the midst of them and gave His life, and who,
while employing human minds and hearts for
His work, means that the help that is done
upon earth He doeth it Himself.

What, then, has all this to say to a conference
of women workers? It suggests a warning,
and flashes an inspiration to you. It
suggests a warning. It is possible that the
keenest, ablest women, like the keenest, ablest
men, may make a mistake which might more
clearly be seen to be ludicrous if it were not
so common, that they imagine they can accomplish
great things without God. History is
strewn with the failures of those who have made
this tragic and hopeless mistake. Many humble
and noble souls who in infinite distress have
found faith impossible have been really in
touch with this wonderful and righteous and[38]
loving Person without knowing it, and have
left behind them on earth the work which
God did through them, and who acknowledge
now in a clearer atmosphere that the work that
they had done He did it Himself. But the
merely busy men and women, the man or
woman who deliberately believes like Nebuchadnezzar:
"Is not this great Babylon that
I have built by the might of my power, and
for the honour of my majesty?" have been
the failure, the laughing-stock of the world;
they have been out of touch with the Source
of all power, and wisdom, and grace, and the
world, when they have passed, will be the
same as it was before.

But if it suggests a warning, what inspiration,
dear sisters, it flashes before you! not so much
to do something you have never done before,
but possibly to do it in a different spirit;
for the first time in your life, perhaps, to be
consciously fellow-workers with God, to come
again and again to God, and to fill yourselves
with great heartfuls of His power and love,
to unite yourself in sacramental union to Him
who came to seek for the lost, to lift up all[39]
work into a new atmosphere, and to find a
joy in it which the world can neither give nor
take away.

That is the glorious prospect which opens
out before us all. God has no favourites;
He is the same for all, and invites all to join
in the great comradeship which changes life.
It is the chance of our life to accept His offer.
"The help that is done upon earth He doeth
it Himself;" and as you find the reality of
that help at your disposal more and more, day
by day and year by year, you will look up as
trench after trench is taken in a power obviously
not yours, to gladly acknowledge: "Not
unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to Thy name
give the praise."



[40]




IV

MISSIONARY WORK THE ONLY FINAL CURE
FOR WAR[5]



"They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy
mountain: for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge
of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea."&mdash;Isa. xi. 9.


It is with a pathetic wistfulness we hear described
by the prophet this Advent picture
of the reign of peace, in which the wolf is to
dwell with the lamb, and the leopard to lie
down with the kid, and the calf and the young
lion and the fatling together, and the sucking
child to play on the hole of the asp, and the
weaned child to put his hand on the cockatrice'
den, and in which the special feature of the
holy mountain was to be that they should not
hurt nor destroy. For we look round after
nineteen hundred years of the religion which[41]
was to bring this "peace on earth and good will
among men," and we see an outpouring of
more blood and an outbreak of viler passions
than has been seen in this world for a thousand
years.

One can little wonder that the cynics scoff,
and those who refuse or fail to look below the
surface speak openly of the breakdown of
Christianity, and that some of the most
earnest and loving of God's children are deeply
moved and disturbed. Is this beautiful picture
a Will-of-the-wisp? they ask. Is it a mirage
in the desert? or are the longing eyes of God's
children some day to see it realized?

I. "They shall not hurt nor destroy in all
My holy mountain." And first we see Belgium
stabbed in the back and ravaged, then Poland,
and then Serbia, and then the Armenian nation
wiped out&mdash;five hundred thousand at a moderate
estimate being actually killed; and then
as a necessary consequence, to save the freedom
of the world, to save Liberty's own self, to
save the honour of women and the innocence
of children, everything that is noblest in
Europe, everyone that loves freedom and[42]
honour, everyone that puts principle above
ease, and life itself beyond mere living, are
banded in a great crusade&mdash;we cannot deny
it&mdash;to kill Germans: to kill them, not for the
sake of killing, but to save the world; to kill
the good as well as the bad, to kill the young
men as well as the old, to kill those who have
shown kindness to our wounded as well as
those fiends who crucified the Canadian
sergeant, who superintended the Armenian
massacres, who sank the Lusitania, and who
turned the machine-guns on the civilians of
Aerschott and Louvain&mdash;and to kill them lest
the civilisation of the world should itself be
killed.

And no doubt for many to-day this belief
in Christianity is trembling in the balance;
the world seems to have returned to the
primitive chaos of paganism from which it
came.


"There's nothing left to-day
But steel and fire and stone."[6]


But this awful nightmare only besets those
who fail to look below the surface. Two[43]
small publications will help those who are in
this frame of mind; one is an excellent lecture
by the Dean of Westminster (Dr. Ryle), entitled
"The Attitude of the Church towards
War," and the other a brilliant little book by
the well-known American writer, Owen Wister,
called "The Pentecost of Calamity."

In the first it is clearly shown that, although
Christianity and War are ideally opposed to
one another, and although when the world is
wholly Christian there can be no war, yet the
writers of the Bible and the Fathers of the
Church have always held that, until that ideal
time arrives, a Christian man might have to go
to war.

In the New Testament itself, as the Dean
points out, we must balance "They who take
the sword shall perish by the sword" with the
words from the lips of the same Divine
Teacher, "He that hath no sword, let him
sell his garment and buy one."

Later on, Christians are found in the Roman
Army in increasing numbers, and St. Ambrose's
and St. Augustine's words quoted by the Dean
may be taken as typical of the teaching of[44]
the early Church. "The courage which protects
one's country in war against the raids
of barbarians is completely righteous," says
St. Ambrose ("De Offic.," i. 61). And St.
Augustine says ("Ep.," 227): "Provided they
are really good men, those who are fighting
are unquestionably engaged in the pursuit
of peace, even though the quest be prosecuted
through bloodshed."

And in Mr. Wister's brilliant essay, after
a delightful picture of Germany as it appeared
to be on the surface in June, 1914, with its
efficiency, its comfort, its culture, and after
especially describing a delightful children's
festival in Frankfurt to celebrate the bicentenary
of Gl&#252;ck, he then portrays the awful
horror which seized him and all the educated
Americans who had learnt to love their holiday
in Germany, when the wild beast suddenly
appeared from among the flowers, and, to use
his own words, made his spring at the throat
of an unsuspecting, unprepared world.

"Suppose a soul arrived on earth from
another world, wholly ignorant of events,
and were given its choice, after a survey of[45]
the nations, which it should be born in and
belong to. In May, June, and July, 1914, my
choice," he says, "would have been, not
France, not England, not America, but
Germany.

"It was on the seventh day of June, 1914,
that Frankfurt assembled her school-children
in the opera-house to further their taste and
understanding of Germany's supreme national
art.

"But exactly eleven months later, on May 7,
1915, a German torpedo sank the Lusitania,
and (this was the awful revelation) the cities
of the Rhine celebrated this also for their
school-children."

He then gives the Prussian creed, sentence
by sentence, compiled from the utterances
of Prussians, the Kaiser and his Generals,
professors, and editors, of which I can only
quote these sentences:

"War in itself is a good thing. God will
see to it that war always recurs. The efforts
directed towards the abolition of war must
not only be termed foolish, but absolutely immoral.
The peace of Europe is only a secondary[46]
matter for us. The sight of suffering does
one good; the infliction of suffering does one
more good. This war must be conducted
as ruthlessly as possible."

Now, I do not quote this (and you will find
four pages of similar sayings) to stir up unchristian
hatred of the German race, many of
whom as individuals would repudiate such
sayings as their own personal belief, but I
do it to defend Christianity. I only heard
just before coming here, in the home of one
of the many mourning families I visit, that a
son who had died in Germany testified in his
last letter to the great kindness with which he
had been treated in hospital.

Such teaching as this is not Christianity;
this is the spirit of Antichrist. You, poor
brother and sister, who are allowing your
faith to be shattered by the war&mdash;you are not
looking deep enough.

Only one nation wanted war, as the pathetic
want of preparation of every other nation
proves to demonstration; only one nation has
set at naught the Christian principles which
have slowly been gaining ground in the conduct[47]
of war; and only one spirit has produced the
war, and that a spirit avowedly and in so
many words passionately opposed to the
Spirit of the New Testament.

And, therefore, it is the grossest injustice
to lay the blame on religion for what has
been produced by its avowed opposite, and
to talk about the breakdown of Christianity
for what is due to the revival of avowed
paganism.

II. But I can imagine my distressed brethren
saying: "The answer is good as far as it goes,
but it does not go far enough. Why, after
nearly two thousand years, has Christianity not
progressed farther? Why is not the world
more completely Christian? Why was the
wild beast left among the flowers? Nay,
why is the wild beast still so active in our
midst? Why did the Drink Bill of our
country go up eight millions in the first six
months of 1915? Why have the scenes
in the streets of darkened London been worse
than they have been for twenty years? You
do not meet me fully," he says, "when you
prove that it was not Christianity which produced[48]
this war; what I want to know is why
it was not strong enough to stop it."

And my answer shall be given to that,
not in anger, but in sadness: "And have you
during this last twenty-five years fought the
wild beast yourself in this great city? Have
you yourself practised strict self-denial to
the point of sacrifice, in dealing with the drink
question, to help the weak brethren for whom
Christ died? Have you crushed down the
wild beast of lust in yourself, and grappled with
the haunts of vice, as many in London have
done for twenty-five years? Have you seen
that there is a Mission Church among every
eight thousand people as they have come into
London, and given of your substance to plant
one? Have you done your best to see that every
sailor that goes from our ports is a Christian,
and that every trader who trades throughout
the world, and every bank clerk who has been
to work in Berlin or Paris, lives up to his
religion? Have you given every available
penny to spread the Gospel, the failure of
which you now deplore, throughout the
world? Or have you spoken of 'sending[49]
money out of the country,' of the uselessness
of Christian servants, and repeated the travellers'
tales about Missions of those who have
never visited a missionary station in their lives,
when you have been asked to support Mission
work abroad?"

Then, until you have done that, I refuse
you the right to speak of the weakness of the
religion which you have failed to support.
It is only promised that "they shall not hurt
nor destroy in all My holy mountain" when
"the earth is filled with the knowledge of the
Lord as the waters cover the sea."

But what if we have never really attempted
to fill the earth with the knowledge of the
Lord? What if we have only very feebly
attempted to know this ourselves? What if,
as a consequence of spending less than a million
a year on Foreign Missions, we are now having
to spend five millions a day on a war made
necessary by the neglect of our Christian duty?

No one believes more absolutely than I
do in the righteousness of the present war;
as I have said a thousand times, I look upon
it as a war for purity, for freedom, for[50]
international honour, and for the principles
of Christianity. I look on everyone who
fights for this cause as a hero, and everyone
who dies in it as a martyr; but, at the same
time, I believe that if every Christian throughout
the world had fully risen to his responsibilities
and had fully lived up to his Christianity,
for the last hundred years, we might have done
more to avert it. You cannot say more than
that. Slavery was undoubtedly as much
opposed as war to Christianity, but it took
eighteen hundred years to abolish that; it
may take another eighteen hundred years to
abolish war. We must not hurry God, but we
must not fail to help Him; we can hasten
the kingdom. It is no good praying "Thy
kingdom come" by itself; we must also make
it come, and the only sure way to make the
kingdom come, and with the kingdom the
extinction of war, is to spread throughout
the world the knowledge of the Lord, as the
waters cover the sea.

We were beginning to find this out before
the war.

A striking pamphlet by Canon Holland,[51]
"The White Man's Burden," has been published
by the great Society which for two hundred
years has tried, amidst much indifference,
apathy and discouragement, to propagate the
Gospel throughout the world. He showed
how our skilled and devoted Governors and
statesmen throughout the world found after
a time that their ability and hard work reached
a point at which they could go no farther.

For instance, quite naturally their system
of education broke down the old beliefs of
India; quite naturally the ideals and ideas
of freedom and personal responsibility which
they taught produced a desire among individuals
also to be free, and a longing in
every nation to realise itself. The great
statesman rubbed his eyes; he couldn't quarrel
with this result of his own teaching. But who
was to bind this transformed nation with new
cords? where was he to find the new restraints
to take the place of the old ones which had
been broken through from sheer life and vigour?
Where were the new wine-skins to hold the
new wine?

And, pathetically, even before the war such[52]
men were turning to the religion which they
had been partially taught at their public
school, but which in their blindness they had
half despised, as having no bearing on a practical
workaday world; but, lo! practical common
sense had broken down; could the secret be,
after all, in what they had heard in their
Confirmation preparation, in that school
sermon to which they had only half attended,
in the prayers which they had said rather as
a matter of form ever since they were taught
them at their mothers' knees?

From end to end of the world the revelation
was coming, and, as one of those who has
borne this white man's burden, Lord Selborne,
in his preface to the pamphlet, endorses what
it says. There is only one set of rules which
will hold the new nation, and only one set of
wine-skins which will hold the new wine; and
that is the rules of God's Commandments
as interpreted and extended in the New Testament,
the Beatitudes and the Sermon on the
Mount; and the only wine-skins which will
hold the new wine are those produced by
the Gospel of the Incarnate, Risen, and[53]
Ascended Christ, with the miracles which
He worked believed, and the Sacraments which
He gave accepted and used. "Let the new
wine be put into new wine-skins, and both
are preserved."

All this was before the war. But since the
war began, just as you see against the dark
thunderclouds the brilliancy of the sunshine,
which even lights up those clouds and turns
them into a glory and a radiance themselves,
so all that was chivalrous and noble in Europe
has suddenly leaped to light. Christianity
has been rediscovered. Censors have been
converted by reading soldiers' letters. Many
a man who professed himself an atheist has
now seen what Christianity really means.
"Even an atheist must have believed if he
had seen my father die," wrote a young officer
of a father who was buried yesterday. "Could
you sing me a hymn?" asked a young officer,
dying in the last battle, of the chaplain, who
in the very thick of the shells and the bullets
was at his work. And, with his arm round
him, the chaplain sang with him "Jesu, Lover
of my soul," until he died.

[54]

In this great Day of God, things are beginning
to appear as they are, and not as they are
represented. "Greater love hath no man
than this, that a man lay down his life for his
friends." That simple and sincere Christian,
the Czar of Russia, went to the heart of things
at the beginning of the war, when he gave
that as the motto of the war to his troops;
and every boy since then, who, as depicted in
the picture entitled "The Great Sacrifice,"
has laid down his life, with his dead hand
resting on the foot of the crucifix, has sealed
with his life the great saying of Sir Henry
Newbolt:


"Life is not life to him that dares not die,
And death not death to him that dares to live."


It comes round, then, to this: the Advent
picture is not a mockery; it is not a mirage in
the desert; it is a true picture let down from
heaven to cheer us to-day with a prophecy
of what some day shall be.

Let that picture at once encourage us while
it shames us.

As we watch it, away with all those foolish
old sayings about "not believing in Foreign[55]
Missions," "sending money out of the country,"
"converting Whitechapel and Bethnal Green
before we attempt China or Japan"; for the
knowledge of the Lord&mdash;before war can be
no more&mdash;is to cover the whole earth as the
waters cover the sea.

But, on the other hand, let it encourage
us:


"Far out of sight while sorrows still enfold us
Lies the fair country where our hearts abide,
And of its joys is nought more wondrous told us
But these few words&mdash;We shall be satisfied."


We may behold the land, although it may
seem at present "very far off."

Once crush for ever the revived paganism,
which perhaps for the last time has challenged
the supreme claim of Christ to His own world;
when that is in the dust, once astonish the
world by the beauty of a chivalry and Christian
manhood which shall be seen by contrast to
be as day compared to night, and light to
darkness; once "placard Christ" through
every tribe in Africa and Asia, and preach Him
effectively in every island of the sea; and as
the last hand slipped down in death the[56]
flagstaff of the Black Flag at Omdurman, so
shall the last hand at last be lifted, in this world,
of one man against a brother-man in fratricidal
strife, and the great picture shall be true at
last:

"They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My
holy mountain": for at last the earth is filled
with "the knowledge of the Lord, as the
waters cover the sea."

V

GOD THE CHAMPION OF RIGHTEOUSNESS[7]



"O Lord, Thou hast been our refuge from one generation
to another. Before the mountains were brought forth, or
ever the earth and the world were made, Thou art God
from everlasting and world without end."&mdash;Ps. xc. 1, 2.


The story is told of Archbishop Temple that
as he was walking away from the House of
Lords, after the defeat of the Bill he had
brought in for the advancement of Temperance,
some well-meaning person was endeavouring
to comfort him in his natural disappointment,
although, needless to say, he was himself
as strong and brave and confident as ever.
Was he looking, asked the questioner, to the
verdict of posterity? No. Was he looking
to the gradual change of public opinion? No.
Was he looking to a verdict in another House[58]
which would influence the opinion of the
house which he had just left? No. What
was it he looked to, then? "I look to God."

It was the answer of a true, brave, and believing
Christian man; if the God of the
Christians exists at all, He is so strong and so
powerful and so wise that to be on His side
is worth all other aid in the world, and to
defy God, apart from its blasphemy, is the
most colossal mistake which can be made.

There is a sense, of course, in which the
cynic was right when he said that God is on
the side of the strongest battalions, for the
raising of those battalions means a self-sacrifice
and a self-denial which God honours and recognizes;
but to imagine that those battalions by
themselves represent God, and can be used
successfully to further causes which God has
beforehand denounced and proclaimed, is to
make, in the long-run, the mistake of the ages.

Now we are keeping Trafalgar Day in a
most critical week of the greatest war waged
in the world for a thousand years. I have
visited the long battle-line mile by mile in
Flanders. I have also seen the grey Dreadnoughts[59]
watching, watching, watching day
and night; it is idle bluster for the enemy to
say that the ships of the Fleet are hiding from
them; they know only too well where to find
them when they want to meet them. As in
great Nelson's day, the Fleet is the girdle
of the Empire; the seas which Nelson swept
are clear to-day; not an enemy flag dare show
itself from one hemisphere to the other;
under the mighty &#230;gis of the Grand Fleet,
transports in hundreds carry troops all over
the world, food-ships pour in from every
port; even when the submarine danger was
formidable there was no appreciable slackening
of the wonderfully brave mercantile marine,
and now that the Navy has that peril, too,
well in hand, men sail the seas to-day, except
for the necessary restrictions with regard to
contraband, with greater freedom and security
than they sailed the seas long after the Battle
of Trafalgar.

In this great conflict on what are we to
found our hopes? To what are we to look?
Are we to trust only to the strength of our
battleships and the perfect training of our[60]
sailors? Are we to look to the new armies
produced with such marvellous skill by Lord
Kitchener's patient hand? Are we to look to
the three millions whose services will be asked
for, and no doubt offered, in the next six
weeks? No doubt we are to look to all these
things; God does only help those who help
themselves. But, standing before you as your
Bishop, I tell you frankly that my belief in
the final victory of our arms is founded on
something far beyond these things. I am full
of unshakable confidence and hope, because,
like Archbishop Temple, I look to God. I
try to say with the psalmist every morning:


"And now, Lord, what is my hope?
Truly my hope is in Thee."

"Lord, Thou had been our refuge from
one generation to another."


Notice I do not claim that God is some
tribal deity who with partial favouritism
supports our side; but I claim, with the great
Lincoln, that we are on the side of God.

1. I do so in the first place (and this comes
out the more clearly the more you study the[61]
previous history of the question), because this
is a wantonly provoked war, planned and
desired and finally launched by one Power,
and one Power alone&mdash;that is, Germany.

Now, if God is a God who "makes men to
be of one mind in a house," if He made of
one blood every nation in the world, and meant
them to dwell at peace together; if the teaching
of Christ is really the teaching of God's
own Son&mdash;then the nation which wantonly
plans and provokes war, and war on such a
scale, must be against God.

You have only to read two such books as
"J'Accuse," said to be written by a German,
and "Ordeal by Battle," by Mr. Oliver, to
see that this is no idle assertion or party
statement, but the literal truth. If I mistake
not, "J'Accuse" will be for all time
the accusing finger of the civilised world
pointing at Germany as Nathan pointed at
David, saying, "Thou art the man"; and as
to "Ordeal by Battle," while it suggests many
political questions which I should not think of
discussing here and now, as to why we were
so unprepared after the warnings given us, the[62]
fact stands out as plainly as daylight that
Russia, France, and Great Britain one and all
made every effort short of national dishonour
to keep the peace.

This, then, is my first ground for claiming
that we are on the side of God. Those who
wantonly provoke war act against God, and
those who honestly try to prevent war act on
His side. But this is only the beginning of
the matter.

2. There has always, up to now, been a kind
of chivalry in war which has lighted up the more
terrible aspects of it. All through history
there have been bright flashes of this chivalry
even among non-Christians: the conduct of
Saladin in the Crusades, the chivalrous bearing
of the Black Prince to the captured French
King, and many similar incidents, testify to the
fact that you need not cease to be a Christian
or a gentleman because you have to fight.
Many of these laws of chivalry were embodied
by the great Christian nations in the Hague
Convention; certain modes of warfare were not
to be allowed; women and children must be
tenderly and chivalrously treated; the wounded[63]
of the other side must be treated as fallen
comrades; the dead must be decently buried;
the Red Cross must be respected; civilians must
be spared; the rights of neutrals guarded.

No one can doubt that God must have
approved of such humane regulations, for
they are all founded upon the New Testament;
they are a softening, and a valuable softening,
of the horrors of war.

All other nations began the war by scrupulously
respecting them: Mr. Stanley Washburn,
who has closely followed the Russian
armies, described the kindness and consideration
which they displayed to the peasantry of
Poland; our own soldiers have never even been
accused by the enemy of violating any of them,
and one of the Generals at the Front told me
with pride that, though his great brigade had
been out from the beginning, no accusation
of injuring a French woman or girl had been
brought against a single member of it.

But, on the other hand, while time shall
last the iniquities committed in Belgium by
the Germans, as attested by Lord Bryce's
Committee, will ring through history; the[64]
very invasion of Belgium itself was a breach
of international faith. A friend of mine saw
with his own eyes, while a prisoner among
the Germans, forty civilians shot in cold blood
in one town alone; the gallant Cardinal-Archbishop
Mercier has recorded a damning
list of other murders in his famous charge.
The sinking of the Lusitania will always stand
out as one of the greatest crimes in history,
although, if I am not mistaken, the judicial
murder of a poor Englishwoman[8] for harbouring
some poor refugees will run it hard in the
opinion of the civilised world. There is one
thing about that last incident which perhaps
was not taken into account by those who
perpetrated the crime: it will settle the matter
once for all about recruiting in Great Britain;
there will be no need now of compulsion.

I wonder what Nelson would have said if he
had been told that an Englishwoman had been
shot in cold blood by a member of any other
nation; he would have made more than the
diplomatic inquiries which have been made by[65]
a great neutral nation into this crime, right
and proper as those inquiries are. He would
have made his inquiries with the thunder of
the guns of the British Fleet, and pressed the
question home with the Nelson touch which
won Trafalgar, as indeed our Fleet at this
moment is only too ready to do. But is it
possible that there is one young man in England
to-day who will sit still under this monstrous
wrong?

There is a famous old rhyme which has
come down from the time of the imprisonment
of the seven Bishops who risked their
lives for the liberties of Britain, as, please
God, the Bishops of to-day are still prepared
to do:


"And shall they scorn Tre, Pol, and Pen,
And shall Trelawny die?
There's twenty thousand Cornish men
Will know the reason why."


The spirit of Nelson must indeed have died
out of our young men, which it certainly has
not, if the answer is not the same to-day; the
three millions of new recruits asked for will be
there. Why was she put to death? Why[66]
was she murdered? Three thousand thousand
Englishmen&mdash;ay, and Scotsmen and Irishmen,
too&mdash;will know the reason why.

My second reason, then, for trusting to God
is that, according to the whole revelation of
His character and will, His curse is on the
nation, however disciplined and efficient, that
tramples underfoot and openly defies the laws
of chivalry which once relieved the horrors of
war; and that His ultimate blessing must be
upon the nation or nations which, however
foolishly unprepared, and therefore, for a time,
suffering from the want of preparation, in the
main are fighting for the weak against the
strong.

3. But if this is the negative side what about
the positive? I am almost ashamed to ask
and answer the question in public again, "For
what are we fighting?" If we are fighting for
the freedom of the world, for the right to live
for the small nations of the earth, for nationality
against pan-German tyranny, for international
honour as the essential condition of a
future brotherhood of nations, then the God
who has been the refuge from generation to[67]
generation of the down-trodden and oppressed,
who planted in us the love of liberty, and who
has been the champion of the free, must be
the God on whose side we are to-day.

4. We are right, then, to look for victory and
help to a God who through one generation to
another has shown Himself a lover of peace
and chivalry and mercy and liberty, against a
delight in war, against brutality and massacre
and tyranny; yet we should have ill-read the
lessons of Trafalgar Day if we were to stop
here.

Nelson never dreamt that God was on his
side in the sense that he could relax for an
instant his vigilance, or ruin his whole settled
plan by impatience, or win a final victory
without the self-sacrifice and trust of the
nation behind him. If we do look to God,
then we must remember this bracing fact that
"God helps those who help themselves."

It is a far-reaching saying that the children
of this world are in their generation wiser
than the children of light; certainly it is a
formidable fact to be faced that for a thoroughly
bad cause, carried out in a thoroughly bad[68]
way, the authors of this greatest crime in
history have succeeded in evoking from the
hard-working people of Germany, who are
under the impression, doubtless, that they
are "saving the Fatherland," a far more
universal spirit of organised and efficient
self-sacrifice than in the most glorious cause
ever entrusted to man has yet[9] been evoked
from all in these islands. It was one of our
great statesmen who truly said that he feared
what he called the "potato spirit" in Germany
more than all their guns and shells&mdash;the spirit,
that is, which was content with potato bread,
content to make any sacrifice, if only their
cause would be victorious; and it is unwise
as well as ungenerous not to recognise the
gallantry with which both the individual
sailors and soldiers of the enemy have fought.

To look to God, then, puts a great responsibility
upon those who do so; it means to rise
to the level of the sacrifice of God. If it is
true that, as you will remember, another
great English statesman once quoted on a[69]
famous occasion, "Who sups with the devil
must have a long spoon," then, Who fights
with God must have a high standard. Is this
a time, asked the prophet of the trembling
Gehazi, to receive oliveyards, vineyards, menservants
and maidservants? Is this a time,
we may ask to-day, to haunt night clubs[10] or
to spend separation allowances in drinking? Is
this a time to ignore Sunday and turn your
back upon God's House of Prayer? Is this
a time to spend anything which can be saved
for the nation on personal comfort or extravagant
dress? The nation that looks to God
must come back to God; it must come back
to God at once and come back to Him for
good; it is a question whether we at home
have yet as a nation deserved the victory which
our righteous cause demands. The sailors of
the Fleet have deserved it; the soldiers in the
trenches have earned it; and when the nation
at home has equally deserved it, all will receive
together their well-merited reward.

5. But more than this; those that look to
God must definitely and persistently seek God's[70]
help. How many of those here to-day pray
earnestly and persistently to God for help
and grace? How many plead in the greatest
service of all the one Great Sacrifice, once
offered for the sins of the whole world?


"Look, Father, look on His anointed Face,
And only look on us as found in Him;
Look not on our misusings of Thy grace,
Our prayer so languid and our faith so dim:
For, lo! between our sins and their reward
We set the Passion of Thy Son our Lord."


How constantly the faith of our fellow-countrymen
amounts to little more than a
vague Deism, instead of a living faith in an
Incarnate Christ. They are learning more
than that in the trenches, and I hope also that
the same truth is being revealed to those who
remain in the broad sea. These beautiful
lines, entitled "Christ in Flanders," the
Editor of the Spectator gave me leave to
reproduce in the diocesan magazine:


"We had forgotten You, or very nearly&mdash;
You did not seem to touch us very nearly.
Of course we thought about You now and then,
Especially in any time of trouble:
We knew that You were good in time of trouble&mdash;
But we are very ordinary men.[71]

"And there were always other things to think of&mdash;
There's lots of things a man has got to think of&mdash;
His work, his home, his pleasure, and his wife;
And so we only thought of You on Sunday&mdash;
Sometimes, perhaps, not even on a Sunday&mdash;
Because there's always lots to fill one's life.

"And, all the while, in street or lane or byway&mdash;
In country lane, in city street or byway&mdash;
You walked among us, and we did not see.
Your feet were bleeding as You walked our pavements&mdash;
How did we miss Your footprints on our pavements&mdash;
Can there be other folk as blind as we?

"Now we remember, over here in Flanders&mdash;
(It isn't strange to think of You in Flanders)&mdash;
This hideous warfare seems to make things clear.
We never thought about You much in England&mdash;
But now that we are far away from England,
We have no doubts, we know that You are here.

"You helped us pass the jest along the trenches&mdash;
Where, in cold blood, we waited in the trenches&mdash;
You touched its ribaldry and made it fine.
You stood beside us in our pain and weakness&mdash;
We're glad to think You understood our weakness;
Somehow it seems to help us not to whine.

"We think about You kneeling in the Garden&mdash;
Ah, God! the agony of that dread Garden&mdash;
We know You prayed for us upon the Cross.
If anything could make us glad to bear it,
'Twould be the knowledge that You willed to bear it&mdash;
Pain&mdash;death&mdash;the uttermost of human loss.[72]

"Though we forgot You, You will not forget us&mdash;
We feel so sure that You will not forget us&mdash;
But stay with us until this dream is past.
And so we ask for courage, strength, and pardon&mdash;
Especially, I think, we ask for pardon&mdash;
And that You'll stand beside us to the last."


What it comes to is the old truth which we
have learnt from Foreign Missions&mdash;the centre
must be converted by the circumference; it is
the self-sacrifice of its Mission work abroad
which has saved the Church from "fatty
degeneration of the heart" at home; it is
the growing change of mind among the
defenders of our country which must permeate
and ennoble the country itself.

Do I look to God? But I could only see
Him in Christ, for He says Himself&mdash;and it is
either the greatest blasphemy or the greatest
truth in the world&mdash;"I am the Way, the
Truth, and the Life: no man cometh unto the
Father but by Me."

Trafalgar Day, 1915, then, should be not
only the turning-point of the world's history,
but the inauguration of a new Britain. If the
war stopped at this moment, should we really
be a changed nation?&mdash;would not the old[73]
miserable internal disputes break out again?&mdash;might
we not again be as we were in July,
1914, on the verge of civil war in Ireland, of
a revolution among women, and of the greatest
industrial strike of modern times? I come
back at the end of so many months of the
war to the picture which I tried to hold up
to London in its first week&mdash;"Facing the war
is drinking the cup"&mdash;"The cup which My
Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?"
We have to repeat the very words of our Lord
Himself.

Have we drunk the cup, and drunk it to its
dregs? Only then will the angels come and
strengthen us for victory; we shall deserve
victory then, and we shall be ready for it, for
the cup which we shall drink will be the cup
to which the Son of God Himself put His lips,
and the courage and fortitude of Gethsemane
leads on to the overwhelming victory of Easter
Day.

It is then "Our Day" in an even deeper
sense than those mean who so rightly ask
our alms to-day for those splendid sister
societies of St. John and the Red Cross. Of[74]
course we shall pour out into their lap, for the
sake of our wounded heroes at the Front, all
that we can; but it is "Our Day" because it
is the day when the nation is tested to the
roots of its being. "If thou hadst known,
even thou, in the midst of this thy day, the
things which belong unto thy peace, but now
they are hid from thine eyes." They are not
hid from our eyes yet; it is still Our Day; but
let it pass, and it has gone for ever.



[75]




VI

THE KNOCKING AT THE DOOR[11]



"Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man
hear My voice and open the door, I will come and sup with
him, and he with Me."&mdash;Rev. iii. 20.


I will come unto him and sup with him, and
he with Me. I think sometimes that we
dwell in our Advent meditation too exclusively
on the thought of the coming Judgment.
Of course we have to dwell on it.
"Behold, the Judge standeth before the door."
A tremendous truth that is. "Behold, the Judge
standeth before the door." There is going
to come a time when the door will come down
with a crash, and we shall be face to face with
the Judge. And this affects every single
period of our lives. We sometimes imagine
that we are going&mdash;dare I say the word?&mdash;to[76]
dodge the Judgment. Not at all; we are
going to look into those Eyes like a Flame of
Fire, and every man will give an account of
himself before God. And every day is making
up the Judgment. Every thought, every
word, every act, every service, every decision
we make, it all goes into the judgment, it all
goes into the verdict. And when the Judge
who stands before the door comes inside, He
registers the verdict and the sentence we have
been preparing all our lives. We go to our
own place&mdash;the place that we have prepared
for ourselves.

Now that is a tremendous thought, and it
is one that we cannot possibly ignore. What
is a person, what is a Church-worker, to do
who realises that the Judge standeth before
the door? What am I to do when I realise
that He stands before the door of my heart?
The answer can only be: Ask Him in as the
Saviour, before He comes as the Judge that
is to be.

I want now to take with you another kind
of Advent&mdash;may I say a more delightful kind
of Advent?&mdash;that is, the Advent of Jesus[77]
Christ Himself into the soul. "Behold, I
stand at the door and knock, and if any man
will hear My voice and open the door, I will
come in to him and sup with him, and he with
Me." It seems at first sight too good to be
true, when you think who Jesus Christ was&mdash;the
Lord of Angels, the Son of God, the
supreme Captain of the heavenly host, the most
perfect beautiful Character that ever lived&mdash;that
He is going Himself to come. Think of it&mdash;that
He is going to come within me, within
you, to live there, to dominate your consciousness,
dominate your mind, your life, so that
you will speak with His words, think with
His thoughts, judge with His judgment; that
He will live in you. It seems almost too much
to believe; and yet this is precisely the thing
which, when we study the New Testament,
we find is promised, not only in this passage,
but in St. John's Gospel. "My Father and I,
We will come unto him and make Our abode
with him." St. Paul's favourite motto is:
"Christ in you the hope of glory." Christ in
you, through the Holy Spirit. He, of course,
brings Jesus with Him. It is said in St. John's[78]
Gospel: "He is with you, but He shall be in
you." And when I speak to a number of
Confirmation candidates, I believe it is perfectly
true to say before the Confirmation:
"He is with you, but He shall be in you." For
that is the great gift of Confirmation, the
falling of the Holy Ghost. "Then laid they
their hands on them, and the Holy Ghost
came upon them, for as yet He had fallen on
none of them."

There is no doubt that this tremendous gift
is the special promise given by Christianity.
Christ wants to live in me. He wants to come
inside. He stands outside the door, but if I
ask Him He will come inside. And notice,
secondly, that this tremendous promise is not
made to a few selected people. You might
suppose that it was meant for a few Sisters of
Mercy, very devoted, who live their lives
among the poor, or to a few particular saints
among the clergy. But you all have this
promise. This tremendous promise comes in
the midst of the message to the Church in
Laodicea, the people who were neither cold
nor hot, the people who were uplifted when[79]
they ought to have been humble, the people
who had to be chastened and rebuked that
they might be made humble, the people who
had not a chance of overcoming in their own
strength&mdash;in fact, people just like you and me.
And it is just because we know this, that I have
to give this message of love to you. It is just
because we know that we are neither cold
nor hot, but lukewarm&mdash;the churchwardens,
workers, sidesmen, Sunday-School teachers&mdash;it
is just because we are conscious, and because
we know that we do want chastening, that we
may be perfected and purified; in fact, it is
just because we are like the people to whom
that message was given that we need to pay
heed to the warning of the message. Christ
says: "I stand at the door and knock, and if
any of you will open the door and hear My
voice, I will come in and sup with you, and you
with Me."

And, therefore, you see, that sets us thinking,
does it not? as to what this knocking at
the door can mean. Is it possible, you say,
that Christ has been knocking at the door, and
I never knew it was He who was knocking?[80]
The whole thing is wonderfully symbolised at
the consecration of a church. Perhaps you
have not seen the consecration of a church.
The Bishop, representing Jesus Christ, knocks
three times at the door, and says: "Lift up
your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye
everlasting doors; and the King of Glory shall
come in." The churchwardens and sidesmen
say: "Who is the King of Glory?" And the
Bishop outside replies: "The Lord of Hosts.
He is the King of Glory." Then the doors
are flung open, and the Bishop enters, symbolising
the entrance of Christ into His Church.
That happens every time a new church is consecrated
in the diocese of London or anywhere
else. Who is the King of Glory? Who is
He? Is it possible that He has been knocking
at my heart and I have never known?

How does He knock? 1. First of all, and perhaps
most commonly, by what we call smiting
the conscience. You notice we use the very
words in our popular language which represents
knocking&mdash;smiting the conscience. Is it
possible, for instance, that even now some of
you have been conscious that you are not what[81]
you ought to be, that your life is not what it
ought to be, that there is something wrong
with you? People sometimes come to me
and say: "Bishop, I want to see you. I am not
right. There is something not right with
me; something tells me I have not done my
work as I ought. There seems to be something
between me and God." Well, you
must cherish that smiting of the conscience.
Do not ignore it or despise it. It is the
knocking, knocking at the door, of Jesus Christ
Himself. There is not a doubt about it.
Sometimes He knocks the door very loudly.
Sometimes His knocks are soft, just like taps.
When some pure-hearted boys or girls are
going to be confirmed, it is a very gentle knock
that Christ makes at the door of their young
hearts. He feels sure they will attend. He
does not have to rouse them by loud
thundering knocks. He comes quietly because
that heart is made for Jesus Christ, and
Jesus Christ is made for that heart. And
therefore at a Confirmation of well-prepared
candidates it is lovely to think how He comes
up and knocks at the young soul, and the soul[82]
recognises the knock, and says: "Come in."
No loud knock is wanted. We were meant to
grow up with "our days bound each to each
by natural piety." Christ, who has taken us
up in His arms at Baptism, is made to come
gently, quietly, and happily, into the young
soul at Confirmation. There is not meant to
be some great break in our lives. We are
meant to grow in grace and in the knowledge
of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
But if there comes this knocking, a smiting
of the conscience, I do pray you to remember
that it is meant in love, that it is Christ
who wants to come within us.

2. Sometimes the knock is a very heavy one,
the heavy dull knocking of a great sorrow. I
have seen a great deal of it, when people have
lost their dear ones in this Great War. One
who had lost the light of her eyes said to me
the other day: "I somehow feel nearer God
in spite of it all." No doubt in that heavy,
sad knock at the door you can hear Jesus
Christ's own knocking. He may come into
the soul through the sorrow in a way in which
He has never come when all is right and bright[83]
and happy. If some of you have heard that
heavy knocking at the door, do not think God
has forgotten you and forsaken you. Rise and
open the door, and Christ will come into your
soul in a way in which He has never come before
in all your life.

3. Sometimes it is the quick happy knocking
of joy. Someone wrote to me the other day
that he had had a great joy. All the darkness
seemed now to have cleared away. He said:
"I see my path in the light of God's love."
There was the quick knocking of joy, and
Christ came in with the joy. The clearer
knock of joy was the knocking of Jesus Christ.

4. Sometimes it is some friend who comes into
the life, some influence, perhaps a parish priest,
who knocks at the door. Perhaps only too
unwillingly at first you open the door, and you
find that in the parish priest who comes you
have found your best friend on earth, and he
by his coming in brings Christ to you; he
brings Him with him, and he leaves Him with
you, if he is a faithful steward. If the parish
priest is a faithful steward, he leads you to
the Master. Then, perhaps, the sudden call[84]
comes. I have seen this happen to many
young soldiers. I lately spent two months
with those who were just going out&mdash;they are
now in the trenches. They crowded in every
evening to have a talk or they lay down on the
ground and drank in every word at some Church
Parade service. I could see, as I watched their
faces, that they were hearing the call of their
country to risk their lives, their all. It brought
them near to Jesus Christ. In the knocking of
their country's call Jesus Christ knocked, and
I believe there are many fighting in the
trenches now every day borne up by a faith
they did not have until this summer&mdash;a belief
in the immediate presence of their Saviour
with them. It would not have happened but
for this sudden necessity of facing the ordeal
of their lives.

Is it possible that all these things, or some
of them, have been happening to you&mdash;or
something different that I have not mentioned&mdash;and
you have never recognised it as yet as
being what it is, Jesus Christ knocking at the
door? Now what are you to do? What
are any of us to do, for I am just one among[85]
you? It seems clear there are three things
that we are bound to do, if this great miracle
(and it is nothing else) is to take place. The
first thing is to listen for and recognise the
voice of Jesus Christ outside the door, that we
may be ready and prepared to open the door.
And do you not think that the reason that
many of us never hear Jesus Christ's voice is
that we never listen for it, that we have no
quiet time, that we have provided no time
for meditation and prayer? We are too busy.
We get up in the morning just in time to start
off for our work; we never have this quiet
time, or only a very few moments to think,
in which the voice will be heard.

Now, I cannot tell you how much I believe
in what I call listening to the voice of God.
We pray, indeed&mdash;we all of us pray. But it
is the ten minutes after prayer that matters,
it is the ten minutes' listening to what He is
going to say back, and often we do not give
that time at all, and so we never get the
answer. Is it not fair to say that some of you
Church-workers just kneel down for a few
hurried moments, and then are up again from[86]
your knees, off to some duty on earth, and that
possibly a few minutes each day would constitute
all the time we devote to listening to the
voice of God? If that is all, can you wonder
when you take your Sunday-School lesson that
it is rather dry, or that your mission sermons
do not seem to have much inspiration about
them, and gradually the voice of Jesus Christ
fades away and becomes very vague? You
do not give time. Do not tell me that in the
twenty-four hours you cannot find time for
the most vital thing in this world. We are
only here for a few passing years. Five
minutes after death it matters more than I
can say&mdash;these quiet times in our lives, they are
worth more than gold, quiet times when we
listen to the voice of God. After death how
still it is!


"I hear no more the busy beat of time,
Nor in me feel the fluttering pulse nor faltering breath."


One moment will not be different from the
next in the stillness and quiet of Paradise.
And in the quiet of the other world how much
we shall regret having had so few quiet times
on earth! Why, one of the very busiest merchants[87]
in the City used to be very regular at a
daily service. I said to him once: "How can you
find time, you, one of the very busiest merchants
in the City, to attend daily service?" He
said: "I am so busy I must go to the daily
service." He felt his business would simply
sweep him away if he did not get a quiet time.
And Mr. Gladstone, you will remember, kept his
Sundays in unbroken quiet, waiting upon God
during the very busiest period of his life. Without
it he would have lost the quiet and strength
of his soul. Therefore make your first resolution.
"I will listen to what the Lord God will
say concerning my soul." "Speak, Lord, for
Thy servant heareth." If you want to have
strength and happiness in your spiritual work,
wait upon God. And in the silence you will
hear the voice of Jesus Christ; you will hear
His knock.

Then, when we have heard the voice and
recognised the knock, the next thing to do is
to open the door. How simple that sounds, does
it not? and how difficult it often is! Picture
some who have had the door of their souls
closed tightly for years. You have to prise the[88]
door open, and you have to break down the
fixed habits of the man who has never prayed
except for a few moments or two in his life; how
hard he finds it to reverse the habits of a lifetime!
Someone who has an old quarrel, through
jealousy or something else, with another
worker&mdash;how hard it is to forgive and begin
all over again! But it has got to be done,
the door has to be prised or forced, because
if Christ is to come in we have to open the
door&mdash;that is our part in it&mdash;and Christ will
come in. And if only we realised how eager
He is to come in, and what a power He has to
change the heart and control the thoughts and
purify the conscience, we should all want Him
to come, and we should not spare any time and
trouble to get the door open.

And when He has come in, notice this wonderful
phrase: "I will sup with him, and he
with Me." He does not come in as a transient
guest to stay for a little while, and go away, but
He comes on a permanent visit, to take up
His permanent residence. And although we
should not have dared to use the words ourselves,
the words "I will sup with him, and he[89]
with Me," describe the most delightful friendship.
Do you desire His presence? How
often do you come to Holy Communion, how
carefully do you prepare for the great gift
of the presence of Jesus Christ in your soul?
Why, I would press this on you, that the
supping with Jesus Christ and He with you
which takes place in the Holy Communion is
the most glorious moment of your whole day.
The first Christians never thought of spending
Sunday without going first to Holy Communion.
It was the special service on the
Lord's Day. It may be that some of you who
used to be regular have drifted away from this
way of receiving the presence of Christ into
the soul. We know no better way for cherishing
the presence of Christ in the soul than
being regular at Communion. The humblest
communicant comes away from his Communion
with the thought: "Christ lives in
me; I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in
me."

Will you, then, take from me these three
thoughts, Listening, Opening, and Cherishing
the Presence: Devotion, Consecration, Communion?[90]
And if you do, I tell you what
will happen to your deanery. It will gradually
become the most Christian fellowship in
London. You will be drawn to one another in
a way in which you never have been before.
We want more unity in every deanery, so that
the parishes may take an interest in one
another, and that all Church gatherings may
be keen and well attended as by a band of
brothers and sisters.

This service now may be the beginning of a
new life for the deanery, not only of a new
fellowship, and of far greater devotion in your
work, and of a joy which you never had before.
Christmas in war time is not going to be a
merry Christmas for any of us. But there is
no reason, if we understand what happiness
means, why it should not be a happy one. If
these three lessons are taken home, you will
as a deanery and individually and as parishes
have a joy which the world can neither give
nor take away.

VII

IMMORTALITY[12]



"Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life:
he that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall
he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall
never die."&mdash;St. John xi. 25, 26.


"Whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall
never die." If a man die, shall he live again?
There is no time in our history when that has
been a more pressing question than it is to-day.
Men are dying in hundreds. I can think
myself of some as dear to me as if they were
my own sons, whose bodies are lying to-day
in some Belgian or French grave. And I spend
much of my time in going to comfort the
widows and the mothers. If a man die, shall
he live again? I wonder whether you have
ever read or heard read this little poem called
"The Army of the Dead":[13]
[92]

"I dreamt that overhead
I saw in twilight grey
The Army of the Dead
Marching upon its way,
So still and passionless,
With faces so serene,
That scarcely could one guess
Such men in war had been.

"No mark of hurt they bore,
Nor smoke, nor bloody stain;
Nor suffered any more
Famine, fatigue, or pain;
Nor any lust of hate
Now lingered in their eyes&mdash;
Who have fulfilled their fate,
Have lost all enmities.

"A new and greater pride
So quenched the pride of race
That foes marched side by side
Who once fought face to face.
That ghostly army's plan
Knows but one race, one rod&mdash;
All nations there are Man,
And the one King is God.

"No longer on their ears
The bugle's summons falls;
Beyond these tangled spheres
The Archangel's trumpet calls;[93]
And by that trumpet led
Far up the exalted sky,
The Army of the Dead
Goes by, and still goes by.

"Look upward, standing mute;
Salute!"


And will they live again? I think that what
chills our faith, and forms really the only argument
that they will not live again, is the dead
appearance of the dead. I am perfectly certain
it is that that chills the faith of hundreds.
The dead look so dead. There is "no voice
nor any that answers, nor any that regardeth,"
and all the attempts, foolish, often even mischievous,
to reach those in the other world have
ended in utter failure. And, therefore, when
we are facing the dead appearance of the dead,
we are facing the only argument there is that
they do not live again.

I want to say now one or two things that I
hope will help you to have a happy view of
death, to make you absolutely certain that
when a man dies he does live again.

1. And, first of all, remember how deceptive
are appearances in Nature. We might be[94]
absolutely certain, might we not? if we did
not know to the contrary, that this earth was
quite still. It does not seem to move in the
slightest degree, but we really know that the
earth is travelling at the terrific speed of
nineteen miles a second through space&mdash;nineteen
miles every second. It does look, does
it not? as if the sun was going round the earth
quite quickly. But actually the earth is going
round the sun. Again, when you blow a
candle out, it does seem as if you really put it
out. But do you? It is just the one thing
you do not do. You do not blow it out. The
force in the flame passes into another form.
The conservation of force or energy is one of
the great truths of science. You do not blow
the candle out at all. Therefore even from
this lowest ground there is nothing whatever
in science that makes it improbable that when
a man dies he shall live again. But you may
go farther, without leaving what we are
taught by scientific knowledge. A man's body
is changed every seven years. Yet the man
does not change. I look back and remember
myself perfectly well as a boy who went to a[95]
certain school. And yet not a fragment of
my present body went to that school. There
must be someone in me that persists, that
goes on when the body changes. If I were to
cut off my hand I should still be myself; if I
were to cut off my arm, my leg, still I should
remain. And so if the whole body goes, I
am still myself. If we had not anything more
than this, we could not prove that men live
after death; but there is nothing whatever in
the whole teaching of science to disprove that
we do. You might, for instance, notice that
an instrument in a room is perfectly silent,
but that may be because he who has been
playing upon it has gone into another room.
There would be no argument in the silence
of the instrument for the non-existence of
the player. I say that because one of the most
touching incidents in my life was when a poor
little girl said to me (I have often quoted this):
"I feel so afraid of death. I seem to see it
coming down on me like a great shadow."
For a moment or two I prayed for the right
word to say to her, and it seemed to come to
me, as it does come at these moments, from[96]
the Holy Spirit. I said to her: "You would
not be afraid if I were to come and carry you
into the next room." "No," she said, "I
should not." "Well, then," I said, "would
you be afraid if someone ten thousand times
kinder, and with ten thousand times more
strength, should carry you into another room?"
When I next saw her she was dead, with a
smile on her face. If the player has gone
away into the next room, no wonder the instrument
does not sound. And therefore, if the
body seems dead, it only seems dead because
the owner of the body has gone into the next
room. It is said in the hospital, as the nurse
comes out from behind the screen: "He is
gone." He is gone&mdash;quite so, he is gone&mdash;therefore
no wonder his body looks dead.

2. And this becomes all the more certain
when you notice that ever since man has existed
he has always believed and felt perfectly certain
that he is going to survive death. This
is one of the great instincts in humanity.
Such convictions always point to some great
truth that corresponds to them. For instance,
the prayer instinct in man demands God. It[97]
has been beautifully said that, just as the fin
of the fish demands the water, and just as the
wing of the bird demands air, so the instinct
of prayer in man demands God. Man is a
praying animal. He always has prayed, and
that great instinct of prayer demands satisfaction.
He always has believed he is going
to live after death, and the very fact that that
instinct has been planted in him everywhere
demands that he shall. There is a very
touching story in ancient literature about the
great Greek philosopher Socrates. Although
he knew nothing about Christ or the Christian
revelation, he had a long conversation, recorded
in one of the most ancient writers, before
he drank the fatal poison, hemlock. Although
he had not the Christian revelation, he gave all
the arguments necessary to make everyone
around him certain that five minutes after death
he would be the same as five minutes before.

3. And this becomes all the more certain when
you consider the character of God. People
often do not realise how much the character
of God is bound up with this question of immortality.
No good man would implant a[98]
living instinct in a child's nature and then
love to tantalise and disappoint it. No good
man would do it, or think for a moment of
doing it; and do you suppose God would?
Let me read you the first portion of a beautiful
letter which I have received from one of the
highest in the land, who lost her husband last
year, and has lost her splendid son this year in
battle. She writes: "Dear and kindest friend,
Lord Bishop&mdash;I have lingered in thanking you
for your letter, because it was so precious, and
is always beside me to inspire and comfort.
England has gone forth 'obedient unto death'
in the honour that befits her, and we must
try and be worthy. It does not seem lonely,
for they have gone in good company, that
great band of brave, shining knights who have
given all." That beautiful trust inspires the
"Farewell of the Dead," which was written
during the early weeks of the war:


"Mother with unbowed head,
Hear thou across the sea
The farewell of the dead,
The dead who died for thee.
Greet them again with tender words and grave,
For, saving thee, themselves they could not save.[99]

"To keep the house unharmed
Their fathers built so fair,
Deeming endurance armed
Better than brute despair,
They found the secret of the word that saith,
'Service is sweet, for all true life is death.'

"So greet thou well thy dead
Across the homeless sea,
And be thou comforted
Because they died for thee.
Far off they served, but now their deed is done
For evermore their life and thine are one."


Now, do you suppose&mdash;this is to me an
absolutely irrefragable argument&mdash;do you suppose
that God would have planted the love of
that son in that mother's heart, and given her
that faith, and then mean to disappoint her?
All I can say is that, if He does, He is no God
I could love, nor that anyone could love. The
world is in the hand of some foul fiend, who
loves to disappoint and blast the hopes of his
children. That is not the God of the New
Testament. No, our Lord says something
very touching about that. He says: "In My
Father's house are many mansions; if it were
not so, I would have told you." "I would[100]
have told you." I would not have let you
live all your lives and see your sons die, and your
husbands die, and then disappoint you. "If
it were not so, I would have told you."

4. And so we are prepared&mdash;you see now why
I chose that particular text&mdash;we are prepared
for the great revelation when it comes. Even
science has prepared us. This great instinct
of the soul, that it will live again, has prepared
us. Our belief in a good God prepared us.
We were all ready to hear it, and at last it
comes from heaven. "I am the resurrection
and the life: he that believeth in Me, though
he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever
liveth and believeth in Me shall never die."

And now we have got it. It has been all
led up to; we were all prepared for it. We
could not have been certain till we were told
it by One who came from heaven. This is
the Christian religion. It is no miserable
half-and-half Gospel about a good man that
once lived. That view of Jesus Christ has
nothing to do with Christianity. The Son of
God came Himself from heaven.

That is the Christian religion. And, having[101]
come from heaven, He knows what is in
heaven. And He speaks with the certainty of
knowledge: "In My Father's house are many
mansions. If it were not so, I would have
told you." And "I am the resurrection and the
life: he that believeth in Me, though he were
dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth
and believeth in Me shall never die."

And, mark you, to prove it, to get the whole
truth this morning, not only for your own
selves, but for the mourners who abound in
our midst, and must abound more and more
as the weeks pass&mdash;to prove this doctrine that
He rose Himself from the dead, we must have
the full gospel of Easter. Alas! a new theology
has been whittling away the faith of some in
this country. But the old doctrine of Easter
was this, "David saw corruption, but He whom
God raised up saw no corruption." And as He
died and was buried, so He rose again. Why do
we keep Sunday, do you suppose, if there was
no Resurrection? Why not keep as the
sacred day Friday, if nothing happened on
Sunday? If Christ did not rise on that day,
why do we have at our Eucharists the Body[102]
broken and the Blood shed? How could any
people enshrine in their Eucharistic service
the tokens of a shameful death unless the
body buried had risen again? How did the
Cross get to the top of the dome of St. Paul's?
Why should we have the old gallows erected
over the finest city in the world, unless it was
the symbol, not only of death, but of glorious
resurrection?

Therefore, we have not got to put our
reason behind our backs in believing that He
who said "I am the resurrection and the
life" raised Himself from the grave. It is
with our reason as well as with our hearts
that we say, in answer to the question, "If a
man die, shall he live again?" "Yes, thank
God, he has never really died."

5. And what sort of life is it going to be on
the other side of the veil, the veil which hides
this unseen world? Those young men who are
dying are not always specially religious. They
come to church sometimes, and some come to
Communion. I had from the front the other
day an account of how two hundred and fifty
of the Artists' Corps received the Communion[103]
before they went into battle. But, still, we know
many of our soldiers are not what we should
call specially religious men. What, therefore,
are we to think of the life awaiting them on
the other side of the veil? Well, I will tell
you what I think. I pin my faith to this:
Jesus Christ knows them through and through.
"Jesus beholding him loved him" was said
of one young man. Jesus beheld all these boys
of ours, all these young comrades, and He
loved them. And He knows what kind of life
they will enjoy, and He prepares them for the
life that is for them. He has something for
each that they will be fit for, when, strengthened
in character and purified in soul, they
are ready to inherit the kingdom prepared for
them. You can trust them with Him, you can
trust your boy to Christ, who understands
him better than you do.

What shall we have in the other world
which will correspond to what we have here?
One thing at least that we shall have is memory.
You remember, in the parable of Dives and
Lazarus, Abraham says to Dives: "Son, remember."
"Son, remember." Resolve to lay[104]
up something in your life here to which your
thoughts will turn happily and find pleasure
in, in the quiet times beyond death. In that
stillness there must be no bitter quarrels to
remember, no bitter jealousies, no unkindnesses.
Make to yourselves, while here, friends
from your use of the mammon of unrighteousness,
so that when it fails those friends may
receive you into everlasting habitations.

And then with memory will come love, all
the old beautiful love and friendship which
makes us so happy here. But, mark you, the
right kind of love&mdash;not lust. "Love is the
fulfilling of the law," says St. John.


"Love comforteth like sunshine after rain,
But Lust's effect is tempest after sun;
Love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain,
Lust's winter comes ere summer half be done."[14]


The two are absolutely different. Love thinks
of the interests of the loved one, and is full of
self-control and self-restraint. But lust only
thinks of self, and is unbridled and unrestrained.
Love goes on into the other world.
[105]

"They sin who tell us Love can die;
With life all other passions fly,
All others are but vanity.
In heaven Ambition cannot dwell,
Nor Avarice in the vaults of hell.
Of lust these passions of the earth,
They perish where they have their birth,
But Love is indestructible.
Its holy flame for ever burneth.
From heaven it came, to heaven returneth;
Full oft on earth a troubled guest,
At times deceived, at times oppressed,
In heaven it finds its perfect rest.
It soweth here in toil and care,
But the harvest-time of Love is there."[15]


Therefore cultivate here in your Church
life, in your home life, this wonderful, pure,
beautiful thing, this love which will last for
ever. "They sin who tell us Love can die."
And, above all, keep that love pure, absolutely
pure and true. Let nothing be substituted
for it which calls itself love, but which is not
love. Then with this love, this unselfish, disinterested
love, the prayer instinct goes on.
Do not be afraid of thinking of and praying
for your dear boy in Paradise; pray for him.[106]
Do you suppose the mother in Paradise ceases
to pray for her son here? You know that, in
the old beautiful prayers of the Church for
her dead, we pray that God will give them
eternal rest and peace, and that everlasting
light will shine upon them. That prayer instinct
that lies so deep here goes on behind
the veil. They are praying for us there as
we are praying for them here. As St. Augustine
says so beautifully, "The Church above
loves and helps its pilgrim brothers."

And, then, one thing more must go on&mdash;energy
and activity of soul. Can you imagine
a man like the late Archbishop Temple doing
nothing for ever and ever? No. The
greatest rest is delightful exercise of the faculties
of the soul. And there must be in that
other world work for those who have been
active here below. Such souls when they are
taken from us are being promoted to some work
that they are specially fitted to do by the
experience which has long worked itself into
their souls. I think of two cases of Christians
suffering patiently week after week, one for
thirteen, the other for fifteen, years. The beautiful[107]
patience being worked into their character
will be wanted in the other world.

Then, again, man is born for a Church. He
is born to worship here in companionship with
others. I hope that this church will be every
Sunday morning as full as it is now, that you
will more and more join in the fellowship of the
saints, and that you will more and more learn
to love this spiritual home, and to cheer one
another on in your spiritual lives, and so be
ready, when the time comes, to worship in the
other world with angels and archangels, and all
the company of heaven. Lift up your heads and
the hands that hang down, all ye mourners!
For death is not that miserable, terrible thing
which some people think it is. We are born
into the other world as quietly as we are born
into this. And the other life there is full of
happiness, full of love, full of joyous and
beautiful activities. And so, when we are
called upon to die, it will only be a gentle
passing from life here to life there, and from
the fulness and the happiness of this life to
the still deeper fulness and still greater happiness
of the life of the world to come.



[108]




VIII

THE PEACE OF JERUSALEM[16]



"O pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper
that love thee."&mdash;Ps. cxxii. 6.


There is no place in the world to be compared
to Jerusalem, if you consider its romantic
position, its historical interest, and its spiritual
significance. What a relief it is to breathe its
mountain air after the hot plains of Egypt!
On what a glorious position it stands, more
than two thousand feet above the sea, surrounded
by hills even higher than the hill on
which it stands itself! Truly, still "the hills
stand about Jerusalem"&mdash;a true image of the
way the Lord stands about His people.

But it is not the romantic position of
Jerusalem which gives it its chief claim to fame,[109]
but, even more, its marvellous history. Really,
to uncase Jerusalem, to dig down from one
Jerusalem to another, to be able to explain
the history which would attach to each layer
of it, would be to unravel the history of the
ancient world. Volumes have been written,
and will continue to be written, on this entrancing
theme; but suffice it to say that the
man who stands, say, at the centre of the
Temple site of Jerusalem is standing on one
of the most historic spots in the world.

But, after all, when one is speaking in a
Christian church at the consecration of a
Christian Bishop, it is neither of these things
which makes Jerusalem absolutely unique. The
Seven Hills of Rome and its Forum might
compete with Jerusalem from the point of
view of geography or history. No! it is the
supreme fact that here, and here alone, on the
world's surface, in Jud&#230;a and Galilee, the feet
of the Son of God actually trod the earth,
which makes Jerusalem unique. Rightly has
Palestine been called ever since the Holy
Land. When the guardian of the traditional
site of the Ascension points out to you the[110]
spot which the feet of the Lord last trod
before He ascended behind the cloud, of
course you know that such tradition is too
detailed to be necessarily accurate with regard
to the actual spot; but that His feet did tread
the earth about that spot, that He did walk
over the Mount of Olives, that He did agonise
somewhere near those trees in the Garden of
Gethsemane, that on one or other of those
skull-shaped mounds He did die for the sins
of the whole world, that either at the traditional
site or somewhere near He did rise
again from the dead&mdash;this it is that makes
Jerusalem the joy of the whole earth. With
ten times the depth of meaning with which
even the ancient Jews could say it, the Christian
will say: "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem,
let my right hand forget her cunning; yea,
if I prefer not Jerusalem in my mirth." "O
pray for the peace of Jerusalem; they shall
prosper that love thee."

I. The consecration, then, of a Bishop of the
great Anglo-Catholic Church, who is to live
in Jerusalem, is an event which concerns the
whole of Christendom, and especially every[111]
branch of the Anglo-Catholic Church throughout
the world; for it is clear that such a Bishop
in Jerusalem has three great and important
functions to discharge to the whole Christian
world:

1. In the first place, he has to represent
worthily, by personal conduct and by reverent
and dignified ceremonial, the great branch of
the Catholic Church to which he belongs.
All branches of the Church meet at Jerusalem;
several have their altars by the Holy Sepulchre.
How can the other branches of the great
Catholic Church learn what is the teaching
and the practice of the Anglican branch except
from the Bishop who represents her there, and
from the cathedral over which he presides?
If the Bishop himself has no dignity, no influence,
no σεμνότης, among all those dignified
and grey-bearded Patriarchs who represent
other Churches, the Church of England will
suffer in the opinion of the whole Christian
Church. If the cathedral church is poor in
worship, feeble in life, unspiritual in tone, the
Church of England loses caste among the
Churches of the world. If, on the other[112]
hand, the Bishop and his cathedral worthily
maintain the best traditions of the ancient
and apostolic Catholic Church of England,
then will the representatives of other ancient
Churches gladly acknowledge that "the Lord
is with her of a truth."

2. But not only has the Bishop in Jerusalem
to be a worthy witness to the doctrine of his
Church, and in his cathedral to display a
winning example of its ceremonial and worship,
but he also has to respect and foster the spiritual
life in the ancient Churches of the East.
He is to be no proselytiser, seeking to take
away members of other Churches to form his
Church; he is rather the kindly brother, ever
ready to lend a hand to fan the embers of
spiritual life in other Churches, or to rejoice
in the fervent glow on other altars besides his
own. No Bishop would be a fit Bishop in
Jerusalem who had not some knowledge of
the history of the ancient Churches of Christendom,
an interest in their varying liturgies,
and a deep respect for their history and the
special significance each has in the life of the
Catholic Church. On the other hand, that[113]
Bishop would have a peculiar glory in his
episcopate who most succeeded by brotherly
sympathy and inspiring example in stimulating
life in an ancient Church, where, perhaps, life
was running low, or was able to send up the
sap once again through the fibres of an apparently
withered tree.

3. But his efforts must not stop there. The
Bishop in Jerusalem must be a missionary. If
from the first the Gospel was to spread throughout
the world, "beginning at Jerusalem,"
Jerusalem must never cease to be a missionary
centre. There must be no faithless despair as
to the eventual conversion both of Jews and
of Mohammedans; the great heathen tribes
of the Shellooks and the Dinkas of the Upper
Nile, up to which the diocese, with its centre
at Jerusalem, at present extends, even though
it must be exercised for the most part through
the presence of an assistant Bishop in Khartoum,
must feel the missionary zeal of the
Bishop in Jerusalem. Every missionary agency
within thousands of miles must be certain of his
fatherly interest. I have visited myself nearly
every mission station from El Obeid, five hundred[114]
miles beyond Khartoum, to Beyrout, and
seen how greatly was appreciated the genuine
interest of even a passing Bishop; but those
mission stations must feel sure of the interest of
the Bishop whose "sedes" is at Jerusalem, and
above all, of course, those must feel sure of it
whose missions are connected with our own
Church. Few people can have visited the
magnificent mission hospital of the London
Jews' Society in Jerusalem, which is said to
be the finest mission hospital in the world, or
seen the devoted work of the representatives
of the Church Missionary Society in Cairo,
or watched the mission schools of the Hosanna
League on the Lebanon, without being proud
of the missionary zeal and spiritual efforts of
our own Church.

II. But on a day like this we are at liberty
to see visions and to dream dreams, and one
can imagine missionary efforts which have their
centre at Jerusalem on a far more extensive
scale than any which have been possible as
yet&mdash;missionary efforts which may include the
revival of the ancient Churches of Asia Minor,
the linking up with the work done by the[115]
Archbishop's Mission to the Assyrian Church,
and a far more complete subjugation to Christ
of the Lebanon district, to which Canon
Parfit's and Canon Campbell's schools seem to
point the way.

Such, then, seem to be the possibilities and
prospects of a Bishop in Jerusalem, and we are
encouraged to raise our hopes high to-day,
first by the wonderful blessing which has been
granted to the work of him who is laying down
the pastoral staff, wielded with so much tact
and love and winning influence by Bishop
Blyth for a quarter of a century; and, secondly,
by the experience and attainments and standing
of him who this day takes up the pastoral staff
which Bishop Blyth lays down.

1. And first with regard to Bishop Blyth
himself. It was said to me in Jerusalem of
the Bishop, by one who has long been the
superintendent of the Church missionary work
in Palestine: "He has laid a splendid foundation
on which a success can be built." Few
can realise, who have not been at Jerusalem,
the dignity and beauty of St. George's
Cathedral, which Bishop Blyth has built, and[116]
the charm of the daily services in it, morning
and evening, at which the choir consists of
the delightful Syrian boys and girls who form
the schools. I have never seen boys more like
English boys in their keenness for games (they
were quite invincible at football) and their
general manliness of tone, and under the
gentle tutelage of English ladies the Syrian
girls are being trained to be well-mannered,
and capable teachers, whom I frequently found
teaching either in Palestine, on the Lebanon,
or in the schools of Egypt and the Soudan.
But, in order to understand the influence
accumulated by Bishop Blyth during these
long years of residence in Jerusalem, you had
to visit with him the Patriarchs of other
branches of the Church; everywhere you found
him trusted and loved; to come with his
introduction was to be welcomed by all the
ancient Churches of the East, and it is certain
that, just as it was said of Livingstone that
"he left the door open in Africa for all the
white men who should come after," so it is
certainly true that Bishop Blyth has left behind
him, among all the representatives of the[117]
ancient Churches of the East, open hearts
into which his successor can enter. And we
are glad to think that we still have the Bishop
resident with us here in London, to give us
his counsel and advice.[17]

2. And then, with regard to his successor,
he is no tyro going out to learn his work for
the first time; he is already one of the best-known
missionaries in the whole of the nearer
East; he has for years been the superintendent
of the Church missionary work in Egypt and
the Soudan; he has had the control of many
workers, and has had, moreover, thousands of
pounds passing annually through his hands.
He is a good Arabic scholar, and can not only
take services, but can speak and preach freely
in Arabic, and what that means in the East
every traveller knows. His long experience of
dealing with the Coptic Church in Egypt, and
the great respect in which he and his colleague,
Mr. Gairdner, are held in it, are a certain
guarantee of the respect and loving reverence
with which he will treat the other ancient[118]
Churches of the East; and he has himself
assured us, in words which have been printed
and circulated, that, so far from wishing in
any way to alter the simple and beautiful
service in St. George's Cathedral, he will love
to fan and foster the flame of devotion which
will always burn, it is hoped, more and more
brightly at the central shrine of the Anglo-Catholic
Church in this city of Jerusalem,
which is itself the cradle of the Christian Church.

It is therefore, dear brother, with very high
hopes and many earnest prayers we send you
forth to-day. The horizon is clouded at
present with the heavy clouds of war; Christ's
work will be crippled for a time, and further
extension for a time will be impossible; but
when the great clouds of war have, in the mercy
of God, rolled away, and the Sun of Righteousness
has arisen with healing in His wings, and
Christianity has been proved to be more than
ever essential to the prosperity and well-being
of the world, then we believe that you
are singularly fitted in the providence of God
to avail yourself of the mighty opportunity
which will open out.

[119]

"O pray for the peace of Jerusalem; they
shall prosper that love thee." There will be
many who will pray for its peace from to-day
more fervently than ever, and they will uphold
your hands as they pray it, as Aaron and
Hur held up the hands of Moses; and if, as we
believe from the bottom of our souls, God
will hear that prayer, then Jerusalem shall
once again be built as a city at unity with
itself, and from the farthest bounds of the
earth there shall come, at least in spirit, "turning
their faces thitherward," more and more
every year, the converted, thankful and adoring
"tribes of the Lord."

II

TO THE CLERGY



&nbsp;[123]




I

MESSENGERS[18]


The Eyes of Flame[19] are resting upon us; we
do not want to get away for a moment from
that thought as our central message. But get
away from the idea that "the Bishop is asking
us to come for a Quiet Day." As I believe
events have proved, it is Jesus Christ Himself
going round the diocese in the power of
the Spirit. Wonderful things have happened
on these Quiet Days. Men have been
so struck to the heart that they have resigned
their livings; they have seen what they ought
to have been, and with the aid of the Holy
Spirit, before the Eyes of Flame, have contrasted[124]
that with what they are. If it is
Jesus Christ coming round, then we cannot
be too quiet on such a Day in listening to His
voice all the time. It is therefore with the Eyes
of Flame resting upon us and with the prayer
"Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth,"
"I will hearken what the Lord God will say
concerning me," that we will think over three
things that we are expected to be. And the
first is a Messenger. You will remember that,
when we first stood before the Bishop for
ordination, we were told of a great treasure
that was committed to our care. We have
spent much time thinking over that treasure.[20]
We were reminded that we were to be
messengers, watchmen, stewards. Now we
will simply take the title "messengers."

Let us picture the messenger; let us forget
the tame surroundings and monotonous features
of the life we lead, and picture ourselves as real
living messengers. We might take one of our
despatch-riders. Few things are more really
splendid than the way the undergraduates[125]
of Oxford and Cambridge are doing most of
the despatch-riding at the front&mdash;our own
boys, we may say, have been carrying the
despatches during this campaign. It is very
dangerous work. One of the boys whom I
have known all his life is now a despatch-rider
in the war, having to take these messages at
any cost. Everything depends upon the
despatch getting there. The whole brigade
will be cut to pieces if the despatch is not sent
there. They only send despatches for the most
urgent reasons. There the despatch-riders
are in the darkness, threading their way
through all the great holes made by the shells,
pushing on to take the despatches. They are
messengers with a vengeance, taking their lives
in their hands, realising the vital importance
of getting their message through.

Now, I am going to take a particular messenger
because his character and life are very
carefully described to us in detail by one of
our great poets. I think it will come home
to us more if I can describe the picture of
the messenger of Athens given us by Browning
in that wonderful poem "Pheidippides." It[126]
may be more familiar to some than it is to
others. I will just sketch Browning's picture.
Pheidippides tells how he started on a mission
of absolutely vital importance, and the whole
problem was to get to Sparta in time to get
help. He dashes off, and stands before the
Spartan Senate.


"Persia has come!
Persia bids Athens proffer slaves'-tribute, water and earth;
Razed to the ground is Eretria; but Athens, shall Athens sink,
Drop into dust and die&mdash;the flower of Hellas utterly die,
Die with the wide world spitting at Sparta, the stupid, the stander-by?"


It is a matter of absolute life and death, and
that is the first thing about the messenger I
want you to notice. Either he got there or
he did not; either he persuaded them or he
did not. He gave his message, though he did
not succeed in persuading Sparta to undertake
the needed help. The fate of his country
depended entirely upon his effort. There is
something glorious in his absolute devotion
to his country. Then, when he had given his
message, he waited for the answer, and he is
described as quivering with eagerness:

[127]


"The limbs of me fretting as fire frets, an inch from dry wood."


That expresses the keenness with which he
waited for the answer. And the answer,
which, as you remember, was an evasive one,
counselling delay, is thus characterised by
Pheidippides:


"Athens, except for that sparkle&mdash;thy name, I had mouldered to ash."


Then, having done everything he could, he
dashed back to tell them at Athens that Sparta
was not coming. We see the utter abandonment
of the messenger:


"Not one word to waste, one look to lose on the false and the vile!
Yet 'O Gods of my land!' I cried, as each hillock and plain,
Wood and stream, I knew, I named, rushing past them again."


Then comes the moment of his life. In the
midst of the hurry and race he suddenly comes
face to face with his god&mdash;the great god Pan.
In all his hurry and haste and keenness he
hushes himself in a moment, to listen to what
the god has to say. Very touchingly described[128]
that is. Then, when he has received the
message for himself, for his nation, once again
he is off.


"I ran no longer, but flew."


And he stands before his people, and he gives
them the full message which the god had given
him, with all its warning and all its comfort
and hope and good news. When that is done
he fights on the Marathon day. And then,
when the victory is won, he thinks of what the
god has promised him, and he thinks to


"Marry a certain maid, I know keeps faith to the brave,"


and live with her for the rest of his life.


"Unforeseeing one! Yes, he fought on the Marathon day:
So, when Persia was dust, all cried: 'To Acropolis!
Run, Pheidippides, one race more!'"


Take the news to Athens! He takes it, and
his great heart bursts with the joy of the
news.


"Pheidippides dies in the shout for his meed."


He sealed his message with his death.

Now, there is the messenger, and we have
to think over the different points about that
messenger, to compare our motives to-day[129]
with what they are expected to be. (1) Take
first of all his realisation that his message was
a matter of life or death. I wonder whether
some of us are slipping away from that&mdash;slipping
away from the awe of that first sermon,
slipping into little moral essays or interminably
long discourses? Are we still men
with a message?

One of the tremendous revelations in London,
after twenty-six years of life and work
there, is the death-struggle that is going on in
every human soul. And even now, as Bishop, I
find that every available five minutes is taken
up by the needs and struggles of some individual
soul in the diocese of London. In
your parishes it must be just the same. Upon
that message you are going to give on Sunday
morning or evening depends perhaps the salvation,
or perhaps the condemnation, of some
soul.

And if we once get into the way of preaching
simply interesting lectures&mdash;interesting to ourselves&mdash;which
we have thought out in our
studies during the week, we have lost the
sense of having a message. One of the most[130]
distinguished men then in the Church said to
a young preacher sadly: "You seem to preach
as if you have something to say, and I only
preach because I must say something." Well,
if we are drifting into getting up into the
pulpit because we must say something, without
realising the temptations and struggles of the
souls in front of us, we have lost our message;
we are no longer messengers.

(2) And then, secondly, what about the old
keenness? Am I able to say "the old keenness"?
One honest brother came to me one
Quiet Day and said: "I have never felt keen at
all." He could not speak of the old keenness;
he had never had it. He wanted it. The
keen messenger stands quivering like Pheidippides:


"Except for that sparkle, thy name, I had mouldered to ash!"


There stands the true messenger quivering with
the keenness of his message. What has happened
to us if we are no longer keen about
our message?

(a) Is it because we have really ceased to
believe it? I say that because during[131]
this past year I have had some who have
openly said (the realisation of it has come
to them during the day) that they have
largely slipped away from their real belief in
Jesus Christ as the Son of God. They started
reading Higher Criticism or German theology.
Of course, we must read very varied kinds of
books; we have no right to be afraid of reading
anything that will enable us to help the laity
in their difficulties. But these brothers had
been reading too many of these books speaking
of our Lord as only a man, in which
we are told that "He was mistaken in supposing
this," or, "No doubt He was under
the impression that this was the case"; and
they have slipped away from their belief in
Jesus Christ as the Son of God. Their faith
has really for a time gone; they have not got
a message, because they do not believe in the
old message. They would have said of such
a meditation as we have had together on the
Book of Revelation: "How do we know St.
John ever wrote it?" And if we meditated
upon our Lord's last prayer in St. John's
Gospel, they would say: "How do we know[132]
that we have the words of the Lord's last
prayer?" Thus their minds are really in
doubt all the time, so that at last nothing
really speaks to them at all. Now, what I
advise is a careful study of the writings of
such a man as Dr. Swete. He tells us that
in that last prayer of our Lord we have,
through the medium of St. John or the writer
of St. John's Gospel&mdash;he believes it was St.
John&mdash;as nearly as you can get them, the
actual words of our Lord's prayer. I am not
taking any particular case, but only trying to
illustrate a state of mind. If you are losing
your message because you are ceasing to believe
it, then all the salt has gone out of your
ministry till faith comes back. If you face it,
and find it is so, ask our Lord, who has come
to speak to us now, to restore to you your
belief in Him once again, so that He shall be
to you the centre of the universe, and you will
be really in a position to say again, as you once
did,


"How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds
In a believer's ear!"


Then you will be able to preach again.

[133]

(b) Or is it that the fault is not so much intellectual
as moral, and there is really something
between you and Christ&mdash;something which
is making your message appear unreal, because
there is something in your life which contradicts
your message? It has been a very
blessed thing that a number of men have
seen what that thing is during these Quiet
Days. Is there anything in your life which
contradicts your message? I remember hearing&mdash;it
was not in this diocese&mdash;of a priest
who did not dare to speak to his young men
and boys about certain things, because his own
conscience reproached him. That is the sort of
thing that makes your message sound hollow
when you get up to deliver it, in the pulpit
or in the Bible-class. "Search me, O Lord,
and seek the ground of my heart, prove me
and examine my thoughts and see whether
there be any way of wickedness in me, and lead
me in the way everlasting." This must be
our prayer. If we say that to our people,
we must say it to ourselves, and get it put
right, though it may be like plucking out the
right eye or cutting off the right hand. When[134]
it is put right your message will ring true
again.

(c) Or is it what you may call "middle-aged
low spirits"? Is it something like accidie.
Dr. Paget describes that dreariness of feeling
that comes over some in middle age. "You
cannot expect that amount of keenness from
me at my age," a man says. I think of three
men myself&mdash;Bishop Wilkinson, Bishop King
and Canon Body&mdash;who were to the last day of
their lives as keen as when they started. So
when you think of these three men, it cannot
be middle age or old age that really produce
this accidie. I dare say it would be equally
true of Mr. Simeon or Mr. Wesley, but I only
happen to know of these three men, who were
like fathers to me. They were as keen up to
the day that they died as ever they were in
their lives. Bishop Wilkinson's last words
before he died&mdash;an address to a committee
of his Prayer Union in his diocese&mdash;were
the same burning words that had fired the
rich people of Eaton Square and the miners
of the North.

Well, if it is not middle age or old age,[135]
must be ourselves who are to blame. Therefore
let us ask for a revival of our keenness,
and not put down the want of it to old age
or middle age. Of course, it may be that a
man&mdash;I want to be quite frank about that&mdash;a
man has been too long where he is. If
you knew how much prayer and thought I
personally give to this matter, how anxious I
am to move men when I see a move would be
for their good, you would realise how distressing
it is to me to keep a man in one place
when he would be much better moved, or promoted
to a living. But the simple fact is
there are not enough livings to go round. I
want you to realise how urgently we at the
centre feel the danger of men getting stale or
being kept in one place too long. But it is
not from the man's point of view that we ought
to look at it. He may pray to have a change.
But while he is there he is the messenger to
the people, who are constantly changing. There
is a new population constantly coming in. He
must be there ready for them. And those who
remain in the parish are still depending upon
him. He is their messenger; he must not[136]
let them suffer because he is tired of his particular
post. I cannot imagine any of those
three men, whom I knew so well, in the least
letting the keenness of their message be
diminished because they thought they ought
to be moved somewhere else. A man may feel
very sad because he cannot do more, but he
must not let his work fall off, although he may
be praying that in God's providence he may
have a change.

(3) Then comes the waiting before God for
the message. Pheidippides bowed his head
even in the heat of the race, bowed his head
and listened. And, you know, one of the
things we have certainly found out lately is
that the great fault of the Church of England
is not listening. We pray, but we do not wait
for an answer. It is the ten minutes after
prayer that matters. It is listening for the
answer to come back. One of the reasons why
English clergy need a Quiet Day is that they
are not good listeners to God. We talk to
Him, we even, as someone has said, chatter to
Him like little children chatter to their parents,
but we do not listen for the reply. We[137]
must listen for the reply when we speak to
God. We must wait for our message. It
must be renewed every day. What is the
message that I am to take to the people?
Rearrange all your time so that you may have
time for listening. That has been crowded
out. It is not a question of how many visits
you can make in a day, but of the atmosphere
you take with you on those visits, and the
atmosphere depends upon the previous "waiting
upon God." Then when you go on your
visit the Holy Spirit opens the door of the
heart of those to whom you go.

(4) Then notice, fourthly, the abandonment
of the messenger. I am sure St. Paul really
loved the picture of the runner. Do you
notice he is always going back to it? The
runner flung aside his cloak, with his eyes
fixed on the goal, like Pheidippides the messenger;
that is exactly what he did: he flung
everything away for speed and alertness, in
order to be there in time&mdash;the one thing
that mattered. Do you not think that it
may be true that we have become too comfortable
as messengers? May it not be that[138]
we have lost the alertness and keenness and
the mobility of the messenger? We have just
settled down into our comfortable homes and
creature comforts. They hinder our movements,
and we do not run with the alertness
of a messenger of God. Of course, we have
to be part of a great system, to have parishes,
to settle down in a certain place, and to
secure that no one is neglected in the parish.
But we must remember, we clergy of the
Church of England, that we are not working
for a particular parish or country only, but for
the whole world. We must not rest content
in being a stolid yeomanry, who can only fight
in our own country, but we are to be a mobile
alert force for the conversion of the world.
We ought to be entirely and absolutely independent
of our comfortable homes, of our
comfortable way of life. It is good to go into
camp and be content to stay there for a
couple of months. We ought to feel that
having food and raiment, with these we shall
have enough. That love of comfort is a great
danger; it greatly hampers us in our task and
in our alertness as messengers.

[139]

And, again, if we are a mobile army for the
world, we ought to be ready to go to any part
of the world to which the Spirit of the Lord
directs us. It often happens that the Spirit
catches away some young curate, and he is
found in some unpronounceable place in Japan
or China. He is there because the Spirit
has taken him there. Therefore we have to
question ourselves very strictly to-day, it seems
to me, as to whether we are detached enough
to be messengers, or whether we have got
clogged by mere custom and the comforts of
life, so that we do not move quickly enough.
Or again, we may be hampered in our movements
by the demand for a full Catholic service
for our own solace and comfort. Those men
at the front who are receiving the Holy Communion
before the battle have little barns for
their service, with flickering and guttering
candles. When they come home they will tell
us they have never had such a Communion
service in their lives as those they had with
their comrades. Honestly I consider it is right
to have, if we can, a beautiful service which
uplifts our souls, to give our people all the[140]
Catholic privileges possible. But we ought
not to be dependent upon it; we ought to
recognise that the heart of the thing is also in
the poor barn and the guttering candle. We
all ought to be content to do without many
things that we have now, if only we may be
allowed to carry our message to the ends of
the earth.

(5) And then, when he comes, he is to give
the full message. Pheidippides stood before his
people and gave it all, the warning, and the comfort
and the inspiration. Do not leave anything
out. One part is as important as another. He
gave the whole rounded message, and we must
be careful to do the same. We must be careful
not to let the Gospel consist of one doctrine
only&mdash;for example, the Atonement. The
Atonement is a part of the Gospel&mdash;a glorious
part of it&mdash;but it is not the whole message by
any means. There is the Gospel of Grace.
We are saved by the death of Christ, but we
are saved by Grace and the means of Grace&mdash;the
power in the water of life to refresh the
soul that is pardoned, and the beautiful sacramental
teaching handed on to us. The prodigal[141]
comes back, and he receives the robe and the
ring, and the home, and the feast, and the shoes
for service&mdash;all these things. The prodigal of
to-day wants them too; the Father's kiss&mdash;the
outward and visible sign of the Father's love;
the ring in Confirmation, the robe in Baptism,
the home in the Church, the feast&mdash;the Holy
Communion&mdash;the shoes for service. You have
got to tell them about everything. You have
no right to say of one doctrine: "This is the
whole Gospel." We must teach the Gospel of
the Resurrection and the Ascension as much
as the Atonement, and the Church's Sacraments
as well. Therefore we have to ask&mdash;have
we not?&mdash;whether our teaching has degenerated
into some little shibboleth, which
we keep repeating over and over again. We
must be messengers of the whole message, and
we must see that we are giving the message
in its fulness, or else there may be souls unsaved
who might be saved by the very part of
it which we leave out. We might be astonished
if we catechised our people as to what we have
really taught them in ten years. Have we
simply given them a series of moral exhortations,[142]
or the same part of the message, year
after year, and not the whole message?

(6) Then, lastly, we must seal the message
with our lives. "Do you really mean to say"&mdash;I
believe it was a girl who asked the question
when present for the first time at an Ordination
Service&mdash;"do you mean to say that
every clergyman I have ever met has been
through that?" Well, apparently we do not
always give the impression that we have.
The messenger has to seal the message by his
life, and by conduct consistent with such a
trust, but also he has got to seal it, if necessary,
with his death.[21] Pheidippides died


"In the shout for his meed."


There ought to be no hesitation about going
to infectious cases if we are called to do so.
I am always quoting what Bishop King told
us in one of his pastoral lectures. He was[143]
warning us against being nervous or having
presentiments. He said: "I had a presentiment
that I should die when I was twenty-six.
And, sure enough, after I was ordained,
the smallpox came to the parish where I was
working. I had to go to the patients, and I
had to sit up with them, and bury one myself.
'Here,' I thought, 'is my presentiment coming
true; I am twenty-six.' But," he said to us
in the lecture-hall, "I am here, gentlemen,
this morning." Therefore we should make it
a rule that what little risk there is in our profession
we should take, after seeing to all needful
precautions. And if it be so that we die
in the course of our duty through some epidemic,
we shall die at our posts, and be doing
what a messenger ought to do.


"'Well,' cried he, 'Emperor, by God's grace
We've got you Ratisbon!
The marshal's in the market-place,
And you'll be there anon
To see your flag-bird flap his vans
Where I, to heart's desire,
Perched him!' The Chief's eye flashed, his plans
Soared up again like fire.[144]

"The Chief's eye flashed; but presently
Softened itself, as sheathes
A film the mother-eagle's eye
When her bruised eaglet breathes:
'You're wounded!' 'Nay,' his soldier's pride
Touched to the quick, he said:
'I'm killed, Sire!' And, his Chief beside,
Smiling, the boy fell dead."


That was a young soldier, a messenger, who
came to tell Napoleon of the success of his
arms. It is called simply "An Incident of
the French Camp."[22]


"Smiling the boy fell dead."


Dear brothers, if we are called to seal our
message with our lives, may God give us
grace to do so!


[145]



II

PHYSICIANS


We have thought over, or tried to think over,
our r&#244;le as messengers. Now&mdash;by that sort
of rapid change which these titles put before
us, and this illustrates the extraordinary
variety and interest of our work&mdash;we have
got to picture ourselves in the sober mien
of physicians&mdash;physicians in a ward, good
physicians, celestial surgeons. We must put
away the picture of the rapid, eager, loyal
messenger, and remember that there is a side
to our message quite different from this,
without which our service as messenger might
degenerate into mere preaching. We have
much else to do besides that. We are house-surgeons,
physicians in a great ward of patients,
and that ward is our parish; and upon our
training, patience, and skill, will depend the[146]
safety and welfare of all this multitude of
patients. They are all entrusted to our care.
But what should we think, for instance, of
a surgeon out at the front, if, with a great
mass of wounded to be attended to, nobody
ever asked him to come, but left him in a tent
without a call? It would not be a very strong
testimonial to his skill or standing or people's
belief in him. And, therefore, we have to ask
ourselves this fresh home question: If in our
ward we are not called in, may it not be that
the people do not believe in us, or trust us,
or think we are sufficiently trained to be able
to help them?

(1) And that brings us, of course, to the whole
question of training for the ministry. It is
really humiliating when you think of it. No
one is allowed to be a physician or surgeon, not
even to begin as one&mdash;certainly not to have
any sort of responsibility&mdash;unless he has had
at least five years' course of continuous training.
And sometimes we think a year or two
at a University or a Theological College, not
necessarily both, quite enough training to become
surgeons and physicians of the soul. I do[147]
think the Church ought to back up the Bishops
in the efforts they are making to remedy this
great contrast. Five years' incessant training
for those who treat the body, and a hasty two
years considered sufficient for the more difficult
task of surgeon and physician of the soul!

Therefore do back us up in our difficult task
of trying to get a better-trained ministry. If
the parish priest only theoretically believes in
it, and is quite upset if his curate is ploughed
in the examination, and writes and begs that
he at least may be let through&mdash;I am only
giving an illustration of dozens of letters I
have received&mdash;that sort of thing does not
help us. It is no good my speaking to you
anything but true words; that sort of thing
does not help us to keep up what should be
the standard of our trained ministry. We
must remember that the real examination comes
in our parish. When we arrive there, it is the
people who really examine us, and if, when
they have got to know us, they find that we are
not worth calling in to minister to their souls&mdash;well,
it is not the fault of the people, it is the
fault of the training and the want of skill of[148]
the physician. And if some were ordained
quickly owing to poverty&mdash;and God knows it
often is owing to poverty: many a man would
be only too thankful for another year in a
theological college&mdash;that is the fault of the
Church. The Church must supply the money
if the men cannot. We have an efficient
Board, in the diocese to-day, of responsible
men choosing out candidates. And if the
Church were a little more generous in its
support, we might have a really adequate
supply of clergy. We have not got by any
means the full number which the Church
needs to-day to send all over the country.

(2) The second essential thing is self-knowledge.
"Physician, heal thyself," is an old
saying. Of course, I am not speaking from a
pedestal, but simply sitting among you, and
speaking to myself as much as to you. The
words I believe Christ is saying to us all are,
"Physician, heal thyself"&mdash;that is to say, we
must see what is wrong in our own lives and
works; otherwise we cannot have the insight
to heal others. We do not know how to do it,
unless we have cut down into our own souls.[149]
The man who has done that is the man who
really knows. It is only the man who is frank
enough to look below the surface and see the
wickedness of his own heart who is the one
who can deal with other people. The Holy
Spirit, who alone knows us through and
through, may bring us to a deeper self-knowledge
to-day, which will make us very much
better physicians. If we heal ourselves first,
we shall know how to heal others.

(3) Then, thirdly, to carry out this great task
we must know our people one by one. Here
is a great difficulty. A parish priest may have
ten thousand people in his charge, but how
difficult it is for him to know each one!
He must do it&mdash;though, of course, partly
through others. He must have a system. I
do not think a parish priest ought ever to be
wholly inaccessible to any part of his parish.
He must have his curates working for him, but
the priests who work with him must have a
system by which the vicar himself will know
when he is wanted. I am sure every parish
priest feels that he must be ready for any
emergency. It is not easy to escape from[150]
councils and committees, but he should be
ready with the surgeon's knife whenever he is
wanted all over his great ward. He must not
leave it wholly to anyone else, so long as he is
responsible. In order to know the people, he
must be up to the last day of his life a visitor.
I hold it to be an absolutely wrong view of
the pastoral office to say: "I can sit in my
cassock in the church, and the people know
where I am, and they can come to me if they
like." Of course, it is a very good thing to
have times when we shall be in church, and
when the people will know that we are there.
There is (let us say) the daily service at a time
which everybody knows; they can catch us
after the daily service, and see us as we go
away. We make it known we shall be pleased
to see them after Mattins and Evensong. And
we have a time before the great festivals when
they can come to prepare themselves for the
great services. All that is wholly to the good.
It is good for the house-surgeon to have a
place where his patients can come and see him.
But something else is wanted. He must be
ready to go out and see them when they are[151]
ill, and find out what is the matter with them.
What should we think of a physician who had
always the same regimen and the same medicine
for everybody? It used to be a joke, I remember,
at a great school at which I was, that the
doctor gave us all the same physic. It was no
doubt a libel on him. But certainly such a
method would be a fault in the case of the
spiritual surgeon; souls would die under such
treatment. We have to ask ourselves: Are there
any patients dying under my hand, in my ward,
because I have not taken the trouble to really
heal them, because I am not going down deep
enough, because I am not finding out what is
the matter with them, because I am not really
acting the part of physician, still less that of
a celestial surgeon?

(4) And then, when we have got the people to
trust us so that they wish us to go to them, or
they come to us with their troubles and difficulties
and sorrows, we must have for our
people the patience of the good physician.
If we have known and benefited by the patience
of our own physicians of the body when
we have been ill, and have realised how patient[152]
they are, if some of our best friends have been
the doctors, the physicians, and surgeons, who
have attended to us, we, too, have got to show
the patience of the good physician to our
people. We have no right to give a sarcastic
answer because a particular parishioner seems
to be beyond the limit. We must imitate
the patience of Jesus Christ. The old story
of "Quo Vadis?" is told in different ways.
One version is that, as St. Peter was, in a fit of
impatience, leaving Rome, our Lord met him
on the way, and he, Peter, asked Him whither
He was going. The Lord answered that He
was going to Rome to be crucified again because
Peter had left his post. Another version of
the same story is that one of the disciples was
asked where he was going, and he said: "I
have lost patience with such and such a man."
The Lord said: "I have had patience with
that man for forty years." Whichever way
you put the story, the point is that we have no
right to be impatient with our people. Why
should we be impatient? Think how patient
He has been with us all this time. We must
have, then, the patience of the Good Physician.[153]
Let me speak to the younger clergy, nearly
all of whom I have ordained myself. Do you
remember that when you were undergraduates
you were not particularly keen when someone
came in to speak to you for your good? Perhaps
you were a little impatient. And, perhaps,
after all is said and done, the young men
of the parish feel very much the same when
you come in and want to talk to them for their
good. I think sometimes we forget that the
young men of the parish are very much the
same as we were as undergraduates, and that
if they do not come on at once to the Bible-class
or want to be confirmed, they are not
very much worse than we were at their age.
Therefore we must pray for more patience
with them. Someone had patience with us,
or we could not have been here in the ministry
at all. Someone bore with all our waywardness,
and with hopefulness brought us on to
something better. We shall never do anything
without patience. It is the patience of Christ
that will win them at last, and they will say:
"Thy gentleness has made me great."

(5) But, then, while we are patient, we must[154]
not be afraid of speaking the uncomfortable
truth. I mean, there is such a thing as being
too kind&mdash;too kind in the sense that we are
afraid to speak out, to cut down, as it were,
with the surgeon's knife. You remember the
Celestial Surgeon of Stevenson:


"If I have faltered more or less
In my great task of happiness ...
If beams from happy human eyes
Have moved me not; if morning skies,
Books, and my food, and summer rain,
Knocked at my sullen heart in vain:&mdash;
Lord, Thy most pointed pleasure take,
And stab my spirit broad awake."


Something of what he means is, I suppose,
humorous. What he means is that something
must pierce below the surface, something must
get home; anything is better than faltering in
our great task of happiness, being dead to the
blessings of life that God gives us. Sometimes
we have to stand up and say: "Thou
art the man." "It is not lawful for thee to
have thy brother's wife." We have got to
say this whenever there is occasion for it. We
have got to speak out for the sake of the man's
soul. It is not easy, but we must be prepared[155]
to do our part as celestial surgeons. There
is many a man who has lived to bless his parish
priest for telling him the truth about himself.
He has been very angry at first, and full of
bluster, but thankful afterwards. We must
never be afraid to be celestial surgeons in the
sense of doing the best for our patients.

(6) Well, then, directly you have done that,
be ready to pour in the oil like the Good
Samaritan. There he is, delightful man,
putting off his business to look after the poor
man, and we are to remember to our shame
that the priest and the Levite had passed by
him. Pour in the oil of sympathy. It seemed
a very little thing to repeat that commonplace
bit of comfort to the mourners; often you
may hesitate to write that letter to the tenth
man or woman who has lost his or her boy in
the war. That letter, written in love, is like
the oil; it comes as a healing balm. You have
poured in loving sympathy. You cannot have
too much of it to give away. The good
physician is full of pity even while he uses
the drastic medicine, and the best surgeon
is wonderfully patient. "When I lost my[156]
boy, when he hung between life and death,
then I found out what my parish priest was
like," people should be able to say. If we have
not got sympathy, and cannot pour in the
oil, where are we? The world expects us to
be kindly, loving, sympathising, sacrificing
physicians in times of trouble and sorrow.

(7) And then, once again, do not forget the
after-care. We have "after-care committees"
for our children when they leave school, but
we are an after-care committee for all our
people's souls. Our Lord understood all about
after-care. When He healed the little girl, He
commanded that something should be given
her to eat. He at once thought of her needs.
He wanted to strengthen her after the strain
that she had gone through.

And that brings us to the beautiful work of
our guilds. There need be no particular kind
of organisation, but we must in our parishes
look round and see that everyone has what he
wants&mdash;see that men and boys, women and
girls, are looked after. When they are cured,
have we provided that something should be
given them to eat, something to strengthen[157]
them? Do we carry out the after-care which
every good physician and surgeon always displays?

I always remember, from my East London
days, a little pamphlet written by the present
Bishop of Southwell. It was called "From
Marriage to Marriage." It made a great impression
on me at the time. I cannot remember
all he said, but the point is this: We were too
much inclined to imagine that everyone had to
go through a dreary course of falls and rescues.
But if we really shepherded the little child from
the moment he was born, it would be different.
Let us begin with the young couple. From
the time they leave the church we have to
look after them. And then, when their child
has come, we have to take care of that little
child and shepherd it from the very start.
If we do not do that, we have left out our most
important work. There is a great deal of work
upon which we are engaged&mdash;e.g., rescue work&mdash;which
would not be on such a gigantic scale
if we had real after-care committees thoroughly
at work in the Church from the time the people
are married.

[158]

We must examine ourselves to-day, then,
very strictly from the point of view of being
good physicians: "What about my parish?
Are my people dying under my hand, through
my carelessness or want of skill? Are there
any whom I do not know or who do not know
me because I have not won their confidence?
Do I visit them as much as I can, and find
out what is the matter with them? Am I
treating them with loving patience, and yet
with frankness and courage and tenderness,
looking after them right on to the end?"
When the Apostles healed a man they gave us
the true spirit in which to do it. "In the name
of Jesus Christ rise up and walk." Not in
their own name, not in their own power, but
in the name and power of Jesus Christ. They
did not try to be popular people and make
people like them; they had but the one idea,
to make it perfectly plain that the power of
their Lord was present to heal; and the result
was that the man leapt up, stood, and walked,
and was seen afterwards in the Temple walking
and praising God. If in our healing work we
keep out the idea of self, and work as good physicians[159]
and celestial surgeons in the name of
Christ, the effect of our work will be that we
shall see numbers in the parish, perhaps paralysed
before, walking and leaping and praising,
not us, but God.



[160]




III

FISHERS OF MEN


We have meditated upon our work as messengers,
and then on our work as physicians
and surgeons; but the duties given us are so
various that it ought to make us feel how
extraordinarily full of interest our work is.
Every faculty of the mind and spirit is wanted
for this wonderful work. We are called sometimes
stewards representing the Master to the
people of the world, looking after the menservants
and the maidservants, foraging for the
food of the household and giving it out. Then
another time we are watchmen on the walls of
Jerusalem, walking up and down watching over
the city and blowing the trumpet when the
danger comes, continually holding up our
hands in prayer.

We do our work as messengers running with[161]
a message, as physicians and surgeons going up
and down the ward, and then suddenly we
hear a voice ring, as it were, from heaven:
"Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of
men." Here we have quite a different picture&mdash;the
wind-swept deck of the fishing-smack
in the teeth of the tempest. "Cast the
net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall
find." We are fishers fishing for men. What
a different picture from the others! And I
think we ask, rather sadly, some of us, who
have been working night and day, whether
we are successful fishers of men. We say:
"Master, we have toiled all the night and
taken nothing." I have this huge parish of
ten thousand people to look after, and what
is the result of my work among them? Have
I been a successful fisher of men? And that
makes us, of course, ask ourselves in a day like
this: "What is the secret of successful fishing?
If I have toiled all the night and taken nothing,
and all the day and taken very little, what
ought I to do? My time is getting on; the
evening will come, my fishing will be over.
Can I not discover in the presence of my Lord[162]
to-day what He would have me do different
from what I have been doing, that I may bring
to His feet a greater harvest of souls than I
have ever brought yet?"

(1) And the first secret of successful fishing
is variety of method. There are some of us, no
doubt, who do fish on our holidays in the
literal sense, and we know how again and
again in the salmon rivers we have tried fly
after fly. And yet in our fishing for men we
often tie ourselves down to one monotonous
kind of method, never thinking of varying it.
But if we have found one method fail, surely
we might try another. Why should we be
tied down to one particular humdrum method
if it has been tried for years and failed? Of
course, there are certain things which must
be the same. We have no right to complain
for a moment of what some people call the
monotony of Mattins and Evensong for ourselves.
Mattins and Evensong are not at all
monotonous. I remember thinking, when I
made that promise which everyone makes when
they are ordained, of obeying the Prayer-Book
and saying Mattins and Evensong every day,[163]
that it would be a kind of slavery to me. But,
on the contrary, I find it a chain that binds
me about the feet of God. The lessons in
these services are four "letters from heaven"
every day, as Canon Liddon called them. We
have spent an immense time in Convocation&mdash;nine
years&mdash;in considering what variations in
the authorised services of the Prayer-Book
may be admitted, and we have almost agreed
upon a supplementary book which will give an
immense variety to the service: a great many
more antiphons, a rewritten preface to the Confirmation
Service, the Marriage Service carefully
revised, and some things definitely sanctioned
for the Church at large which we have
used under provisional sanction in this diocese.
We hope to have the new supplementary book
out at the end of the war. Think, for instance,
of the Psalms. Has not the Great War revealed
to us the depth of the Psalms&mdash;"the war-songs
of the Prince of Peace," as they have been
called. The war has given to many a new
meaning which we never saw before. And think
of all the needs of the sick of the parish, and
our personal needs, all to be woven into these[164]
beautiful services which we use every day, and
which seem to bind us to the feet of God. If
any of you have drifted away from your regular
use of Mattins and Evensong, or if you have
not started it in your own churches, make a
resolution to start it from to-day. When
your people hear the bell ring, that will tell
them that at any rate the clergyman is at his
prayers.

Of course, we do not want our beautiful
services to be altered in substance; but we may
have variations sanctioned by authority. In
fishing for men we are not bound by one
method. If we find that one method does not
succeed, we must try another. I have already
sanctioned in the diocese a shortened form of
Evening Service. For those not reached by
services in church we must have open-air
services. People will listen at the windows in the
little square or street in which they live. There
must be, too, special services for such organisations
as Boy Scouts and Church Lads' Brigade.
For the ordinary Sunday-School we are now
able to have new methods provided by experts
for the diocese. Then, if the Sunday-School[165]
system does not seem to suit your particular
parish, try catechising in church. I am only
suggesting&mdash;it is not for me to lay down this
or that rule as to what is to be tried. My
point is this: With the Holy Spirit guiding
you, and with the inventiveness of love, you
will be able to bring out of your treasure things
new and old. Although one of the oldest things
in the world, the Church is yet the youngest.
We never grow old, and, acting with the inventiveness
of youth, we ought to be thinking
out new plans and new methods all the time;
and while I am speaking upon the inventiveness
and freshness of the successful fisherman,
I need not say that I shall be only too happy
to sanction almost any new experiment you
may wish to make in fishing for men, if you
will submit to me the prayers you think of
using, and if I think the suggested method
consistent with the teaching of the Church to
which we both belong.

(2) Then there must be, too&mdash;every true
fisherman knows this&mdash;a ripple on the water for
fishing, best of all a light breeze in the morning.
That means that it is a fishing-day. And[166]
do you not know what I mean when I say that
there seems to be no ripple on some parishes at
all? The whole of the surface of the parish seems
as dull as ditch-water&mdash;no ripple, no fish. If
there is no sense of expectancy, no keenness,
no enjoyment, no happy spirit, among the
workers, there will be no fish. I would like
you to ask yourselves whether there is such a
ripple in your parish, or whether it is all very
dull and dead. And I would like to ask anyone
who seems to recognise that there is nothing
going on, and that there has been no catch,
yesterday, to-day, or the day before, to ask
himself if he cannot go back and create a ripple
in the parish. When you think over how that
ripple is to be created, of course, it can only
be by the power of the Holy Spirit brooding
over the waters, as He originally brooded over
the waters and brought cosmos out of chaos.
I believe the chief way, if I may reduce the
metaphor to prosaic terms, the chief way must
be by constantly praying for the parish and the
people, that the Holy Spirit may come and
stir the dulness by creating a spirit of expectancy
and a joy in the work. When you are obviously[167]
enjoying your work yourself, and making the
Sunday-School teachers and the workers enjoy
it, you may expect a ripple in the parish.
Joy in the work is a most attractive thing.
There must be the joy throughout the parish,
among clergy and workers; the curates and the
Vicar must be at one, with no friction between
them, and they and the workers a real band of
brothers and sisters all fishing in the same
waters. Pray very earnestly for this. I shall
not bring in more at this point about the
necessity for intercession. Remember that it
is the parish priest who is perpetually praying
for his people individually, and teaching his
people to pray, who is the most successful.
In my experience it is the praying parish that
has a ripple on the surface. I see a wonderful
quantity of fish caught in a parish of that
kind.

(3) Then think what is the cord or line by
which the fish are caught. "I will draw them
with the cords of a man," by human influence, by
personality. Now this question of personality is
a very difficult one. Dr. Newman is said to have
stated that he dreaded personal influence. Well,[168]
of course, it is quite easy to see what he meant.
He dreaded such personal influence in religion
which is used to make people simply like us or
to draw them to ourselves and to leave them
there&mdash;that is to say, he dreaded a misuse of
personal influence. So misused, no doubt,
personal influence is a dangerous thing. But
that does not alter the fact that people are
drawn to Christ by personal influence, and
that we must use our personal influence if we
are to be successful fishermen for Christ.

And that brings me to this personal question:
Is there anything in ourselves that puts people
off? I wish to be perfectly frank. Is it not
a fact that we clergy sometimes do put people
off by our manner and appearance? Even
the smallest thing is important if it is going
to spoil the line or cord that is to draw people
to Christ. I believe we put off people more
than we know by carelessness about our appearance,
or manner, or matters of that kind.
So much depends on us that we cannot take
too much care of our personality. We should
see to it that when people meet us they can
see the attractiveness of goodness in us, and be[169]
drawn to our Lord because they are first
attracted to His representative. And do ask
yourselves&mdash;I might seem to be personal if I
went into details: Is there anything in my
manner that is spoiling Christ's work so that
He cannot fish with me, cannot draw others
through me? Is it because I am not humble
enough, or is there something in me, some unattractive
feature or characteristic, that is
spoiling the fishing?

(4) And then, of course, there must be the
hopefulness of the fisherman. The true fisherman
is nothing if he is not hopeful. "Master,
I have toiled all night, and caught nothing;
nevertheless, at Thy word I will let down
the net." The true fisherman never knows
when he may be successful; he is always expecting
something at the last moment, and he
manages to infuse hopefulness into his fellow-workers;
he hopes that there is going to be good
fishing in the day or the night. I had a rather
touching illustration of the value of hopefulness
in a little hospital near where I was spending
a holiday. Five sisters, friends of mine,
who really managed the whole hospital, sent[170]
a telegram from the village asking if I could
come and see one of the young soldiers, whom
they could make nothing of. He was absolutely
in despair. He had lived a bad life,
and I think it was the presence of these five
good girls who were nursing him that made
him feel the contrast between his life and
theirs, with all its purity and goodness. The
contrast brought him to repentance. Still,
he thought it was too late to change. He
could not be forgiven. I went to the hospital.
There he was, a young man about twenty-eight,
really in despair. It took me a long time to
get any hope in him. At last, when he had
gone into his whole life, and I had given him
absolution, and had a prayer with him, I saw
a sort of hope come into his face. The change
was extraordinary. He said: "Will you pray
with me again, Bishop?" In all my experience
I have not very often been asked
like that to pray again with a man. They
are generally shy, and satisfied with the first
prayer. I prayed with him a second time.
He wrote me afterwards a charming letter,
asking me to send him a Bible and Prayer-Book,[171]
which I did. What that man wanted
was hope, nothing but hope; he was in despair
about himself. "God shall forgive thee all
but thy despair." We shall never catch a
man like that unless we can infuse into him
that glorious hope which we have ourselves.
I persuaded him that he was not too late, and
he was saved by hope.

Now do let us carry back the hopefulness
of the fisherman to our parishes, whatever
may have happened in the past. Many
of you have been in your parishes very many
years, and no doubt sometimes you have
felt very despondent. Start again to-morrow
as if you had just begun. Though you
have toiled all the night and perhaps caught
nothing, cast your net on the right side of
the ship, and the next five years will be the
most fruitful years your parish has ever had.
People will notice a different spirit about yourself.
Try a completely new method, and you
will have a wonderful success. There will be
a ripple on the water which there has not
been before. Be hopeful about it, and then,
if you have to stay on in the same parish five[172]
or ten years more, it may be a wholly different
story from what it has been up to now.

(5) In the next place, a successful fisherman
must have a very deep faith. Of course, the
ordinary fisherman must have some sort of
faith. The good fisherman believes certain
things all the time he is fishing. He believes
in the laws of the wind, studies them, and
acts according to them. He sets his sail according
to them, if he is fishing in the sea, and
he knows that he must do so if he is to reap
of the unfathomable harvest of the sea. He
believes in all these things, and on a stormy
coast he must be a man of great faith, dealing
with great unseen movements and powers all
round him. He learns their laws, and he
knows that if he acts according to those laws
he is successful as a rule. But do you not see
that we are just like that ourselves? Really
we are in touch with all kinds of unseen powers
and movements. We have to believe, for
instance, in the salvability of every soul in the
world; we have to believe that every soul is
meant for the Gospel, and the Gospel is meant
for every soul. We have to believe in that[173]
man in the worst slum of our parish; we have to
realise that the Gospel is fitted for him and he
is fitted for the Gospel. No one has ever been
found yet who could not be made into a bit
of a saint in time. And the Gospel, tremendously
deep as it is, is also so simple that
the simplest can understand it. That is the
wonderful thing about it. We have to believe
in it&mdash;intensely believe in it; we have to
believe in the wonderful power of these tides
of the Spirit sweeping round a parish and
working wonders; we have to believe in the
influence of the unseen wind that blows over
it and to pray often: "Come from the four
winds, O breath, and breathe upon them."

We are, as a matter of fact, working amidst
unseen and tremendous forces. We talk about
the power of God. The power of God!
Why, He keeps the whole universe going,
twenty million suns always moving on through
space. He alone knows whither they are going.
Twenty million burning suns! look at the power
of that; think what power that alone implies!
and then think of the saving power of one drop
of blood shed upon the Cross, when you consider[174]
Who it was that hung there. Think, again, of the
wonderful influence, the downrush of the Spirit:
some of you have seen it in missions; we believe
in it at every Confirmation. We are really in
touch with most tremendous powers. If we
had more faith we should be better fishermen.
Therefore we do want a stronger faith in our
Lord Himself, always at the heart of our work,
a real living faith in a living Lord with us all
the time.

(6) And then, sixthly, we must fish for men
one by one. Of course, we can have great concerted
movements. I shall never forget a midnight
march through Westminster at half an
hour after midnight on a Saturday night. We
swept like a net, bringing quite twenty young
men out of every public-house. As we counted
them in the church school, we could see that
most of them were three-quarters drunk.
We could see what would be prevented if
the public-houses of London were shut earlier,
as, indeed, they now have been during the war.
It has benefited Russia greatly that she has
abolished the whole vodka traffic. We could
not take pledges that night from those men:[175]
they were not in a condition to make them;
but the Church of England, with all her great
organisation, ought to be able to prevent that
sort of thing, and catch these souls one by one.
Here comes in the need of personality; we must
talk to each of these young men, provide somewhere
else where he may spend his evenings,
and remember that you can only catch fish
one by one.

(7) And the last point of all is that, to be
successful, the fishing-fleet must be kept together.
You really are a fishing-fleet, and not merely
individual fishing-boats. When a deanery is
kept together, it shows a brotherhood, a cohesion,
which is a very beautiful thing to see.
To a large extent you are such, but, still, even
the best-worked deanery can resolve to work
more together than they have done, in happy
co-operation, the clergy and people of each
parish taking an interest in another's parish, rejoicing
in its successes and praying for it in its
troubles. If the whole deanery meets regularly
for united intercession, this must have a great
effect upon the mission work in the district.
It must have an effect also upon mission work[176]
among the heathen for the Church at home to
feel part of the same fishing-fleet as the Church
abroad, the workers in one ship beckoning to
their partners in the other ship to come and
help them.

Well, then, take back with you these simple
thoughts which I am trying to put before
you as your Bishop and fellow-priest. Pray
to be made more keen, more alert, more active
and enthusiastic messengers. Pray to be skilful,
patient, thorough, good physicians, and
kinder celestial surgeons. And, perhaps above
all, pray to be hopeful, faithful fishermen; go
out together as a fishing-fleet on the great
ocean, believing in all the possibilities which
lie beneath the surface; realise the presence
of your Master directing from the shore the
whole fleet. And then at the end of all things,
in the morning of the great day, you will have
a harvest of souls to draw to the shore to His
feet.

III

TO GIRLS



&nbsp;[179]




WHAT A GIRL CAN DO IN A DAY OF GOD[23]


When I think of all the vast influence exercised
by those in this hall, I feel inclined to say
what Bishop Selwyn said in the midst of Eton
Chapel&mdash;"You can turn the world upside
down."

But, before I say anything of my own, I
want to emphasise what has already been said
to you, with regard to the influence at the
Front of those who are here at home. As I
went down behind the firing-line in 1915, and
held seven or eight services a day, before each
service began I invariably said one thing from
end to end of the line. I said: "I have come
here, boys, before we have any service, to
bring you the love from home of your mothers,
your sisters, and your sweethearts." And
you saw the soft look that came into those[180]
boys' faces while the guns were firing&mdash;and
sometimes an aeroplane was guarding the
service for fear the Germans should not be
able to resist a target of four thousand men,
and a Bishop in the middle&mdash;you would know
what they think of home, and how you have
got the heart of the Empire in your keeping.
One of the boys who has died the death of
honour wrote home to his mother: "I have
come here, mother, for one purpose&mdash;and
that is, that you and the sisters shall not be
treated like these Belgian women have been."

I am going to put the message at the very
highest at once. I have never found young
people fail to rise to it. I am going to put
upon your lips, as your resolution, no less a
resolution than was on the lips of our Lord
Himself, our great High Priest, just before
He went to His own death&mdash;"For their sakes
I sanctify Myself, that they also may be sanctified
in truth." I say High Priest, because I
am going to put this one single thought before
you as describing the function which girls are
to discharge in a Day of God, and that is, they
have got to be priests of God.

[181]

Now, that may seem to you a strange thing
to say, but before I have done I shall have
failed indeed if you do not believe it. I am
always trying, in London, to unite all the
great Christian bodies in common action. We
fight as one family, side by side, against evil,
sin, intemperance, and impurity. Every year
all the denominations in London elect me
chairman of the London Temperance Council
and of the Public Morality Council, and it is
by focussing the whole of the Christian thought
of London that we are as strong as we are,
when we tackle night clubs, and living pictures,
and other abominable evils, and destroy them
in the name of the Lord. I say that because
I believe fully that if everyone understood
what the teaching about priesthood was it
would take away much misunderstanding, and
I believe would join together many Christian
bodies divided to-day. There is only one
Priest in the Universe, and that is Jesus Christ
Himself. But He says Himself that the
Church is His body. Therefore, the whole
of the Church is the body of a Priest. Those
of us who are called priests are ordained as[182]
organs of a priestly body. We act in the name
of the body, and therefore the idea that we
are setting ourselves up above this or that
person is wholly wrong, because we act as
organs, as hands and feet&mdash;as it were&mdash;of a
priestly body. And mark you, the Church is
the great company throughout the world of
all baptized persons, baptized by whoever
baptizes them.

If you think that out, you will see what a
powerful idea this idea of priesthood is. Have
you ever seen a priest ordained? I wish
sometimes, though I am afraid you would
fill the whole dome of St. Paul's Cathedral,
that you could come some day and see what to
me every time is a most touching sight: you
would have seen those young men, thirty
perhaps, as were there at a recent ordination,
brought up before the Bishop, who has other
priests standing round, and then on the head
of each, as he kneels in front, we all lay our
hands, and I say, "Receive the Holy Ghost
for the Office and Work of a Priest in the
Church of God." A young girl said once,
"Do you mean to say every clergyman I see[183]
has been through all that?" But now, if
that is so, why do I look round on you and
say you are young priests of God? Why?
Because you are part of this priestly body.
You are joined to the one great High Priest,
and therefore you, whom God knows one by
one, are known and named and called. Of
course in the Church Confirmation is the
ordination of the lay priest, and if you are
confirmed, I am going to tell you five things
you are expected to do.

1. The first is to be girded. I have more
to do in my life, and naturally so, with young
men and boys than I have with girls and women,
but that very reason gives me an added
authority in speaking to you, because I know
what their difficulties are. I speak, constantly,
to as many young men as there are
of you girls; I say, knowing what difficulty they
have at their age to control their passions,
that it is like ruling a horse. A horse is a
splendid servant, but a vile master. When you
have got the bit in your horse's mouth and
the reins in your hand, a horse is a splendid
servant; but let him off at full gallop, with the[184]
reins round your feet and the bit in his teeth,
then he is a terrible master. So it is with the
boys. They have got to be on the horse with
the reins of God's Commandment in their
hands, and the bit of self-control in the mouth,
then their bodies are glorious servants. What
you young girls as priests have got to do is to
help those boys and young men in the very
flower of their lives not to do anything which
is afterwards a stain upon their conscience.
You can rally round them and, if you are
young priests, can help them.

There are three things of priceless value a
young girl has on her side in doing this. The
first is her natural modesty. Why are we
so afraid of bad companions breaking down a
girl's modesty, and why are we so afraid of
rough horseplay soiling the purity of her
soul? Because it is spoiling her first great
gift, her first great power. It is just that
naturally beautiful modesty a girl possesses
with which she is meant to help every
young man. That modesty is meant to
help her to be self-controlled, and to help
him to be so too. Then she has a most[185]
wonderful power of self-sacrificing love. I
say to the young men, "Never take advantage
of the trusting love of a girl"; but to you I
say, you have that beautiful power of true
love. It is that power of sacrifice and self-sacrificing
love which is your great asset to
the world. Never soil it, and never spoil
it, or let it be dragged down by anyone.
And you have a naturally religious nature.
Those three things, those three splendid things,
you have got with which to gird yourselves.
Allow anyone to rob you of them, and you
have lost your strength. Keep them and you
have the first great quality of a true priest
of God. Gird yourselves with modesty, unselfish
love, and natural and supernatural
religion.

2. And when the young priest has so girded
herself, the next thing she has to do in discharge
of her priestly office is to offer up every
day an oblation of prayer and praise to God.
He is looking for it every day. Do you
remember the story contained in a poem by
Browning of a cobbler boy who used to praise
God at his work every day? He was wafted[186]
away to another sphere, and there was silence
in the workshop, and God said, "I miss my
little human praise."

Make then your second resolution, that,
having girded yourself, you will never fail to
offer to God this sweet incense of prayer and
praise, and do it perfectly openly. Don't
be ashamed of it being known you do it.

In "Studies in a Devotional Life," Canon
Peter Green tells us how he shared a room
in a little hotel in South Africa with two men,
who looked like brigands. Not liking to say
his prayers openly in their presence, he slipped
outside, and said them on the veldt, only to
find on his return the "bearded ruffians,"
who proved to be Cornish miners, kneeling
in prayer themselves. This so impressed the
writer that, when on one of the South African
expresses he had to sleep in the same place as
three postmen, he overcame his shyness, and
said his prayers openly. Next morning, one
of the postmen, an old choir-boy who had
forgotten to say his prayers for a long time,
confessed that the clergyman's action had
shamed him, and he would begin again that[187]
day. So the simple influence of one example
ran down the line.

3. Your third duty, and I get to love it
more myself every year, is not only to pray
for yourselves, but to plead for others. On my
prayer-desk, there are two or three hundred
intercessions for mothers, whose sons are at
the Front, and for the boys themselves. What
a beautiful task it is to intercede for them in
turn, so many a day! We are promised that our
prayer shall be heard, your prayer just as much
as mine. Begin with intercession for fathers
and mothers, brothers and sisters, people you
are next to at your work, your parish, or the
church you go to, and so on, extending right
out to the boys at the Front. Pray to God for
victory; don't be ashamed to pray for victory
in a glorious, a righteous cause like this.
Pray that all this may be overruled for the
spread of God's kingdom in the world. And
always pray for the lonely missionaries, so
often disheartened, so tired, so far away. And
mind you, if you have not begun doing all
this, you are going to begin. When I went
down to a parish which had not been very[188]
efficiently worked, I collected a number of girls
into a club, and got them to come for their first
service. I had just become Rector of Bethnal
Green, and the committee of the club wrote:
"Dear Rector,&mdash;We think it our duty to
inform you that in our opinion our club
service was a success, and we beg you to have
such a service for us every month until further
notice."

Well now, those girls were starting their
religious life; but when I go down now I find
what I started as a little, tiny thing grown
and grown and grown; those people whom I
spoke to first are now grown women. It all goes
on if you once make a good start. Therefore
do take up, if you have never taken up before,
this process of interceding. I am organising
all the children in London this year in intercession
for the war, and when we pour in a
million children's prayers, is it not going to
be a power which is going to bring down the
blessing of Heaven on our cause?

4. Then we come to the fourth task of the
priest.

The fourth work of a priest is to consecrate[189]
or dedicate himself every day. I do ask you to
realise, as every day comes, what possibility
there is in a day. There was a young Bishop
who was consecrated the other day; I think
he was the youngest Bishop consecrated. I
knew him very well, and I had just one minute
to write a note, and I wrote this, and he told
me afterwards it had been more help to him
than anything that had been sent to him.
Therefore I pass it on to you: "Take one day
at a time," I said, "and trust the Holy
Spirit to see you through." Now I believe
that that is the real secret of spiritual life.
Take one day at a time. Don't worry.
Don't be thinking of all kinds of difficulties
in future. Take one day at a time, and trust
the Holy Spirit to see you through. Dedicate
every day and consecrate every day. Think
over those whom you are going to meet during
the day. Be prepared beforehand for the
special temptations and difficulties of that
particular day; remember that no day will
ever come again, and that every day has to be
lived out as a young priest of God. If every
girl in Nottingham dedicated or consecrated[190]
herself every day like that&mdash;taking one day
at a time, and trusting the Holy Spirit to see
her through&mdash;why, there would be a power
of strength in this city which would astonish
the world.

5. Then we come on to the fifth great
priestly task of service. I was talking to a
little boy of nine. His mother had turned his
beautiful home into a hospital for wounded
soldiers. She herself was girded, dressed as
a nurse, and the little fellow was in bed, rather
seedy that day, and I sat down on his bed at
his mother's request to have a chat with him.
He said: "I love, Bishop, having the soldiers
here; we cannot go back to our old life after
the war." There is nothing so good as a life
lived out in service, every day helping other
people, and, if we are going to carry nothing
else away, we are going to carry away this,
that there is nothing so valuable as service.
Even the lad's mother, a rich woman, who had
served for ten months as a nurse, said: "Had
I only known, Bishop, what to do before,
I should have done it. This ten months has
been the most delightful service to me I have[191]
ever had in my life." How can you girls,
working girls many of you, serve in your daily
life? All the work you do for the nation
in the great factories of Nottingham, done
honestly and straightforwardly, as young
priests, with no bad language or bad stories
allowed amongst you, is all recognised, and all
blessed as part of your priestly service. But
you can do more than that. I find again
and again that in London the best Sunday
School teachers, the best girl guides, the best
members of the League of Honour there, are
hard-working girls. Their service has gone
beyond their professional work, and they also
use their leisure time at home. They are the
best girls at home their mothers ever had.
I remember a father saying to me: "Mr.
Ingram, I'm not much of a churchgoer myself"&mdash;he
did not come at all, as a matter of
fact&mdash;"but I will say this, that my boy as
does go is the best boy I have got." What we
want them to say about the girl who goes to
church or chapel is: "She is the best girl
we have got at home, the most willing, the
most satisfactory, and the most loving."

[192]

There, then, you have the five priestly
functions to discharge, and you have got to
discharge them "for their sakes," as well as
for your own.

For whose sake?

First for the sake of the boys, who are dead.
There is a beautiful poem about the other
world, which was given me the other day,
and which I pass on to you in the hope
that it may bring a little cheer in the dark
night to any present who have lost their
brothers, any mothers who have lost their
sons.


"Lest Heaven be for the greybeards hoary,
God, who made boys for His delight,
Goes in earth's hour of grief and glory,
And calls the boys in from the night.
When they come trooping from the War
Our skies have many a new gold star.

"Heaven's thronged with gay and careless faces,
New waked from dreams of dreadful things.
They walk by green and pleasant places
And by the crystal water-springs;
Forget the nightmare field of slain,
And the fierce thirst and the strong pain.[193]

"Forget? God smiles to see them merry,
For His own Son was once a boy;
They never shall be old and weary,
But of their youth shall have great joy,
And in the playing fields of Heaven
Shall run and leap, new-washed, new-shriven.

"Now Heaven's by golden boys invaded,
'Scaped from the winter and the storm;
Stainless and simple as He made it
God keeps the boy's heart out of harm.
The wise old Saints look down and smile,
They are so young and without guile.

"Oh, if the sonless mothers weeping,
The widowed girls, could look inside
The Country that hath them in keeping
Who went to the Great War and died,
They'd rise and put their mourning off,
Praise God, and say, 'He has enough!'"[24]


Secondly, it is for the boys who will come
home that you have your five priestly functions
to discharge. They will come home very
different to what they went out. I saw this
wonderful transforming power as I went down
the lines. Boys came out of the trenches,
with the mud upon their puttees, knelt down[194]
and asked me to confirm them, thirty at a time
(of course they had been previously prepared
by the Chaplains).

Many came to other services. They sang
"When I survey the wondrous Cross," while
the guns thundered close by, with a reality
which it was impossible to mistake. Are they
coming back to irreligious girls, to careless
sweethearts, careless sisters who neglect their
religion, to girls who would drag them down?
No. Let us have here a country and a Church
worthy of its defenders, to which they can
return. Let us have such a work going on
at home, side by side and step by step with
what is going on in Flanders and the Dardanelles,
that when they come back they may
find a changed England at home. For their
sakes you must sanctify yourselves&mdash;for the sake,
too, of the little sister who looks to you as her
model and her example. You have more
influence over her, perhaps, than anyone else
in the house, except her mother. For her sake
be a priest of God, and&mdash;I say it without the
least sense of immodesty&mdash;also for the sake of
the children who are to be. I speak to-night[195]
to the future mothers of the children of
Nottingham, and it makes all the difference
to the young mother, as she looks round her
children, and, when they grow older, tries to
influence her growing sons and daughters,
whether she can look them in the face without
shame and without a blush, and is only asking
them to do what she tried to do herself before
she was married. For the sake of the children
to be, exercise this glorious priesthood. If you
do you will ennoble Nottingham by your action.
You will make it a city set upon a hill; and
"a city set upon a hill cannot be hid."



&nbsp;&nbsp;




IV

TO BOYS



&nbsp;[199]




THE EFFECT OF THE HOLY GHOST ON
HUMAN CHARACTER[25]



"For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and
of faith."&mdash;Acts xi. 24.


I need not tell you, not only how much I
look forward to my Marlborough day, but also
how much I have thought as to what message
I would give you. When I think of the many
to whom I have preached at Marlborough
year by year, of the three hundred now dead,
of the hundreds more who are fighting, and
of the fact that many of those to whom I am
speaking would soon, if the war went on, be
in the thick of it, I realise what a very solemn
thing it is to come down to Marlborough and
give a message to my old school.

I will tell you what made me choose this[200]
message. The fact that Whitsuntide this year
comes on the same day as St. Barnabas' Day
gives me a subject, the most solemn subject
I have ever taken at Marlborough&mdash;viz., the
effect of the Holy Ghost upon human
character. St. Barnabas was one of the most
attractive characters in the New Testament,
an example of attractive goodness. He was
such a gentleman in all he did, and therefore,
if we could have produced in us, by the Holy
Ghost, the wonderful character that the
Holy Ghost produced in St. Barnabas, we
might have that description used of us;
just think what it would be for men to say of
us&mdash;"He was a good man, full of the Holy
Ghost and of faith."

What, then, is the effect of the Holy Ghost
upon human character? You might say,
"But do we have the falling of the Holy
Ghost, too?" Why did we have that hymn
this morning, "Our blest Redeemer, ere He
breathed"? I was asked to choose the
hymns, and I chose that one because it so
beautifully describes the indwelling of the
Holy Ghost on your Confirmation day,[201]
and that is what makes the School Confirmation
the crowning event of the year. At Confirmation
you have the falling of the Holy
Ghost in exactly the same way as happened
in the early Church. Yesterday, for instance,
I confirmed, under the dome of St. Paul's
Cathedral, two hundred and thirty people of
all ages. "What is the effect of the Holy
Ghost upon human character?" Some people
imagine that what is called "doctrine" has no
practical value. But is this true?

(1) The first thing that the Holy Ghost does
is to convict the world of sin. He shows people
what they really are. You may have heard
of the National Mission of Repentance and
Hope, and wondered what it was. I will tell
you. I have just come from a tour round
twenty-four dioceses in support of that
Mission. I do not for one moment understand
by that Mission that we do not believe
we are fighting God's battles in the war. I
believe that those three hundred Old Marlburians
who have fallen in the war have died
as martyrs. I believe the world is being
redeemed by precious blood again to-day, and[202]
that that precious blood is being mingled with
the Precious Blood. I believe also that the
freedom of the world and the national honour
are being saved to-day by the precious blood
of our sons and brothers. It is, therefore, not
because we do not believe we are doing the
right thing in this war that we are engaged
in this Mission; it is because we believe we
are called to save the freedom of the world,
and the national honour, and to see the Nailed
Hand prevailing over the Mailed Fist, that
we have to repent. Admiral Beatty said, in
effect, that we should never win the war until
the nations came back to God, and it is Lord
Roberts (peace to his ashes, and glory to his
memory!) who, just before he died, said we
had got the men, the ammunition, and the
guns now; what we wanted was the nation on
its knees. And it is to bring the nation to
its knees, back to God, that is the great object
of the National Mission of Repentance and
Hope. A messenger in connection with that
Mission will very likely be sent down to
Marlborough.

Meanwhile let the Holy Ghost do His[203]
work. He is the great Messenger, the great
Missioner. Ask the Holy Ghost to show you
yourselves as you really are. It is the hardest
thing in the world to see this (easier for a boy
than a grown-up man), but we cannot get on in
the spiritual life unless we are shown ourselves
as we are. If a light is shown into a darkened
room, the dust is discernible on the furniture,
and stains are seen where it was thought no
stains were; and we cannot carry out the
teaching of the Gospel, and cast the beam out
of our own eye, until we have seen it. All
progress really begins with humility.

We must therefore let the Holy Ghost
show us ourselves as we are. "What does God
think of me?" should be the first question we
should ask ourselves, and the Holy Ghost
will give us the answer. But that is only the
first thing the Holy Ghost does. If He left us
there, contemplating our stains, our infirmities,
and our sins, it would not be much of a
message of a Gospel of Hope.

(2) No, the next beautiful work of the
Holy Ghost is that He takes Christ and
shows Him to us. I paid a touching visit[204]
the other day to an old clergyman who,
some people would have said, was past his
work. He was ill and in lonely lodgings,
and I went to see him. The old clergyman
gave me a great lesson. Instead of complaining,
of saying that he had been a failure, had
been neglected and passed over, he said: "I
hope I shall live a few years longer, Bishop,
to preach the glorious Gospel." There he
was, lonely, ill, passed over by the world, yet
feeling the great joy of simply preaching the
glorious Gospel. We are apt to get mechanical
about our religion. Even in the lovely service
here at Marlborough, we are sometimes&mdash;very
often, perhaps&mdash;wandering in thought, and inclined
to become mechanical in our religion.
The Holy Ghost makes it living. He takes of
Christ, shows Him to us, and makes the whole
thing real. Therefore, our second prayer
should be that the Holy Ghost will make
religion a reality to us, make us understand
the glory of the Incarnation, that God actually
came to earth in mortal form, for our sakes.

(3) Thirdly, the Holy Ghost is the Comforter.
He comforts us and helps us to comfort[205]
other people. I remember, when I was at
Marlborough last year, that I had several boys
in to see me, one of them a little fellow who
had lost his father in Gallipoli; and I tried to
comfort him. The Holy Ghost is the only
Comforter. When one goes to a mother, as
I have done, who has lost, perhaps, three sons
(and in this connection we at Marlborough
shall always think of the father and mother
of those three splendid sons, the Woodroffes),
one is at a loss to say anything; one cannot
comfort them oneself, but has to depend upon
the higher power; and my experience is that
the Holy Ghost brings the Balm of Gilead,
which no earthly agency can produce, a
heavenly balm of comfort for the mourners
which enables us to go out and comfort
others. There is no comforter better than
the younger boy of a family, who, filled with
the Holy Ghost, goes home in the holidays
to comfort his father and mother in the loss
of an older son.

(4) But, of course, the old words "comfort"
and "comforter," as applied to the
Holy Ghost, meant far more than we call[206]
"comfort." "Comfort" in the case of the
Holy Ghost, means far more than sympathy;
it means fortitude, courage, inspiration. The
comfort of the Comforter always strengthens;
mere sympathy sometimes weakens. We have
got to bring home the bright view of death, to
produce a pride that "my boy, my brother,
my husband, should have died." I believe
that we have not anything like a bright enough
view of death.

It is the Comforter that can make us believe
that. It is the Comforter that can breathe
fortitude into the splendid mothers and wives
of England, and to the lads in the trenches,
up to their knees in mud, facing danger every
moment, that can bring fortitude to the
nation; and it is the task of the Church to
breathe fortitude to the nation to go on until
the end.

(5) The Holy Ghost has two more beautiful
things to do for us, and is always ready to do
them. The first of these is to guide us. The
other day I heard the hurrying footsteps of
a layman coming after me in the street as
I was walking to a meeting. The layman,[207]
who told me that he was a churchwarden
of one of the churches in the Diocese of
London, and had never spoken to his Bishop
before, asked for a message to give in an address.
I gave him the same message I had given to
a young Bishop some months before[26]: "Take
one day at a time, and trust the Holy Spirit
to see you through." This is a great truth,
and one which I will pass on to you, as you
leave this place to take up your work in the
larger world outside. I remember having
asked a rich clergyman, at the beginning of
a Sunday afternoon, whether he would go
down and take a very poor parish in the East
of London, where there was no money and
the credit of the parish was very much shaken.
He did not at first seem inclined to go, and,
thinking nothing more about it at the time,
I went into St. Paul's Cathedral, and preached
upon the text, "Led by the Spirit of God."
In the evening I received a pencilled note
from the clergyman, stating that he had been
in the Cathedral, that he was led by the Spirit
of God to go to the parish. He went, and[208]
splendid work he did there. There is not
one of you who need be left to your own
guidance; the Spirit of God will lead every
one, and guide you all your lives.

(6) The sixth thing which the Holy Spirit
does for you is to pray in you. It is not very
easy to pray. I expect many of you get a bit
disheartened about your prayers; you kneel
when "Preces" are called in dormitory, and
get up feeling cold and dead, and that it is
sometimes rather a matter of form. Prayer
does not depend upon feeling; we ought to
pray in the belief that the Holy Ghost will
pray in us, and in that way God calls to God,
the deep calls to the deep, and the smallest
boy in the School is able to share the supreme
energy of God.

You see, therefore, that this doctrine or
truth about the Holy Ghost is the most
practical thing in the world. Resolve to-day
that you will really make your bodies temples
of the Holy Ghost. The boy who is filled
with the Holy Ghost will be the merriest boy
in the School and the pluckiest at games; he will
always be chivalrous and unselfish, and there[209]
will be a something about him, besides, that
will really breathe the presence of the Heavenly
Spirit, who dwells in him. You must have
a little more spiritual ambition, and all of
you make your prayer that you may be, like
St. Barnabas, "good men, full of the Holy
Ghost and of faith."

V

THE WAR AND RELIGION



&nbsp;[213]




THE WAR AND RELIGION


It was not until I had had a little correspondence
with the Secretaries that I decided
upon the subject for my address as "The War
and Religion." I was very anxious not in the
slightest degree to violate any canon expressed
or unexpressed with regard to the subject of
these addresses, and I think I can assure any
in this audience who may have their doubts
upon this matter that they will leave the hall
without having their consciences offended in
the slightest degree, even if they may profoundly
disagree with the conclusions to which
I may come. And I am encouraged in saying
this by a little incident which occurs every
year. I am Visitor of Queen's College in
Harley Street, founded entirely by the influence
of Frederick Denison Maurice, and it[214]
is my pleasant duty to give the girl members
of it an annual address. My subject, at their
special request, is always Religion; and although
quite a large proportion are Jewish girls, I find
that they look upon me in after life as quite
as much their friend as the others, and come
to me in their troubles, and they prefer that
I shall speak to them out of the deepest convictions
of my heart, rather than offer them
some trite and colourless observations which
mean nothing.

After all, there is great truth in the proverb
that "the shoemaker should stick to his last,"
and it cannot be entirely without purpose that
apparently about once in five years an ecclesiastic
is brought on to the scene here in his
plain and sober raiment amid the glittering
galaxy of Generals and actors and scientists and
other distinguished men who in other years
fill this distinguished office. I have this
summer had the high privilege of visiting every
battleship, battle cruiser, and most of the
smaller ships of the Grand Fleet of Great
Britain, and the thousands of sailors I addressed
instantly caught the idea that of course I came[215]
to represent "Religion." I told an East-End
story which appealed at once to the lower deck,
so many of whom come from places like Bethnal
Green, Poplar, Stepney, and similar localities
at Portsmouth and Chatham. A rather shy
East-End curate, on knocking at a door, heard
a voice from the wash-tub at the back ask in a
shrill voice, "Well, Sally, who is it?" and was
rather depressed to hear Sally shriek back,
"Please, mother, it's religion." But, as I told
the sailors, my invariable advice to such a man
is this, "Don't be ashamed of representing
religion; you were not dressed in a pudding hat
and a dog collar and a long black coat to talk
about the weather."

I make no apology then for plunging at once
into the question of "The War and Religion."
It is very striking to notice the different way
in which the War has affected different minds
with regard to religion. While I have had
some poor young widows throw down their
Bibles and (for a time) give up their prayers
when their husbands were killed, I have found
others who in their sorrow have found the
comfort and force of religion for the first time;[216]
again, on the battlefield, while some express
themselves coarsened by the "beastly work,"
as they express it, which they have to do, others
write, "Nothing does any good out here but
prayer and trust in God; we all feel it. War
is a great Purge." Or again, "There are no
atheists out here; there are few of us who do
not put up a prayer in the trenches."

1. Let us look then first at the case against
religion, and then the special case against the
Christian religion as deduced in many minds
by the existence of the present War.

(1) I take Religion, as the word implies, to
be a TIE which binds us to someone, and I am
further assuming that to have any religion
worth the name, that "Someone" must be
good and just and Righteous.

Well, now, can we not easily see what a strong
prima facie case could be made out against the
existence of a really strong and good and
Righteous Supreme Being in the light of the
appalling suffering and the at present unpunished
wickedness on a gigantic scale which
is being witnessed at the present time.

"Why did God ever allow the War? and[217]
if there is a God, why does He not stop it?" is
a question which is dinned into my ears from
morning to night by anxious mothers and even
by men who have not had time to think very
deeply over the mystery of God's dealings
with mankind.

For nine years I used Sunday by Sunday
to lecture and answer questions in the great
East London Victoria Park. I can imagine
the questions they are asking now. "Either
He cannot or He will not"&mdash;this was always
the favourite dilemma on which they sought
to impale me about the suffering in East London.
"Either your God cannot stop it or He
will not." "Either He is a tyrant who gloats
in it all or He is a weak ruler who has no control
of His world."

And these questions, which were difficult
enough to answer then, are intensified in their
point to-day. It is difficult to select out of the
horrors which have passed before our eyes one
worse than another, but probably the most hellish
thing done on earth in the last five hundred
years has been the attempted extermination of
the Armenian race; even as described in the[218]
restrained pages of Lord Bryce, it has more
tragedy than any battlefield, for there at least
men die in the heat of battle for what they
think a great cause, but here, in cold blood and
with every circumstance of bestiality and lust,
women and children were slowly done to death.
And yet "God does nothing." This is the
accusation. No thunderbolt comes from
Heaven; the brave Russians do something to
avenge the hideous crime, but God&mdash;where
is God? He is like the ancient gods described
by Tennyson&mdash;


"On the hills, like gods together,
Careless of mankind,"


and all this cry from sinking ships and praying
hands is to Him


"A tale of little meaning,
Though the words are strong."


(2) But if the case against religion at all is
strong owing to the War, still more is the War
supposed to be fatal to the Christian Religion.
Here into the world it came two thousand years
ago with a great flourish of trumpets about[219]
"Peace on earth, good will to men," and what
is the result?

After two thousand years, the bloodiest war
which has yet taken place on earth; waste of
treasure beyond counting every day, and waste
of something much more precious than material
treasure, the precious blood of the best manhood
of the world. I have received their
broken bodies into my own arms in the front
dressing stations; I have consecrated the
graveyards where their dear bodies lie. I
know that tens of thousands of those who
would have been the fathers of the future race
of mankind are lying beneath these little
crosses in Flanders or Gallipoli, and that many
a maiden will die childless to-day, because
those who would have been husbands in the
fair days of peace are buried now in a soldier's
grave.

And all this&mdash;and here lies the bitterness of
the accusation&mdash;started by the great Christian
nations of the world. The Mohammedan Turk
joins in as the war goes on, but then only under
the influence or domination of a Christian
Power. "Could you ask," cries the triumphant[220]
opponent of the Christian religion,
"for a more complete proof of the breakdown
of your Christianity than the spectacle of
Europe to-day?"

II. It is clear then that we who stand for
religion, and especially those of us who stand
for the Christian religion, have got our work
cut out for us to-day to answer these accusations.
I want the men and women whose
work lies largely in other spheres to enter into
our difficulties. We are asking people not only
to pray, but to pray more earnestly and with
greater faith and hope; we are not sitting down
with Buddhist resignation under the inevitable.
"If it rains, it rains, and if it doesn't rain, it
doesn't rain," was represented to me as the
philosophy of the Indian troops whom I had
the honour of entertaining for a week in my
grounds at the Coronation of King Edward VII.
On the contrary, we are in the midst of a great
National Mission of Repentance and Hope;
we have the fullest intention of winning the
nation to God; we are adopting as our text
the saying of that grand old man, Lord Roberts,
"We have the guns now, and the men and the[221]
ammunition; what we want now is a nation
on its knees."

We have indeed our task cut out for us, and
I hope that it may at least be of some intellectual
interest, if not some spiritual profit,
to the thinking men and women here to hear the
arguments upon which we rely.

(1) In the first place, we definitely repudiate
the picture of God as the arbitrary ruler who can
do exactly what He likes; at least we repudiate
this as the revealed picture of the way in which
He has willed to act in His relation to mankind.

Probably the passage in the Bible which has
given the greatest colour to this idea, and
which certainly is largely responsible for the
distortion of Christianity which is associated
with the name of Calvin, is the picture of the
Potter and the Clay. "Shall the thing formed
say to him that made it, why hast thou made
me thus? Hath not the Potter power over
the clay, to make one vessel unto honour and
one into dishonour?" This is the passage
from St. Paul's writings which is most widely
quoted in this connection. At the first blush
this seems to confirm our worst fears; but[222]
when we trace this illustration of the Potter
to the original passage in Jeremiah we find
an absolutely different picture; the potter is a
patient, resourceful person who, so far from
having arbitrary powers over the clay, is being
defeated at every moment by the refractoriness
of the clay with which he has to deal. He
attempts to make, let us say, a porcelain vase,
but the clay will not respond to his efforts;
there is a flaw in the material, or the clay is not
of the kind to make such a design possible;
he starts again with his "Gospel of the second
best," and this time he succeeds in making a
humbler but useful bowl. Or again, in the
course of his work, something goes wrong, and
"the vessel becomes marred in the hands of the
potter"; but even now he is not defeated; he
tries again&mdash;to use the words of Jeremiah&mdash;"he
makes it again another vessel, as it seems
good to the potter to make it." This is the real
picture of the potter, and it is a touching
picture when you consider that it is meant for
all ages to describe the dealings of God with
the human race, of which we ourselves are
members.

[223]

Of course, the question entirely hinges upon
what God meant mankind to be. We used to
discuss this question in East London Sunday
after Sunday&mdash;"Did He mean mankind to be
like clocks, bound to go right, like puppets who
would dance to the strings which He pulled; or
did He mean them to be what we call human
fallible men, who might go right or wrong,
but who in any case had the freewill to do
either?"

And it is a striking testimony to the common
sense of a great working-class audience that,
while they started with a predilection in favour
of being made to go right, after an afternoon's
discussion they invariably came to the conclusion
that with all its risks it was better to be
men and women; that forced goodness was no
goodness at all, and that if God did wish to
have as His companions in eternity companions
worth having, He could have done nothing
less than endow them with freewill.

Now, if this is so, it is obvious that the
metaphor of the Potter and the Clay has a
great bearing on the question of "The War
and Religion."

[224]

Let us assume, as we are bound to do, that
the first design of the Great Potter was a
porcelain vase of universal Peace. He made
men of one blood in every nation of the earth;
he loves to make men "of one mind in a house."
Work and trial were to be part of man's lot,
but not War. The idea that War is in itself
a glorious thing may be the doctrine of
Treitschke or Bernhardi, but cannot, I believe,
be found in the Bible.

This, then, is His first design, but the clay
will not take this design. There is a stubborn
element in human nature determined upon
War; there is a "throw back" to Paganism with
which the Potter has to reckon. It is not His
fault. To coerce, to crush Freewill is to crush
His own Image in mankind, to make any kind
of freely chosen goodness impossible. He must
give up for the time, with what regret we can
never know, His first design. He may see of the
travail of His soul one day and be satisfied, but,
for the present, He must bring in the "Gospel
of the second best." He will bring good out of
this evil; He will produce a bowl of unselfish
service. The devil makes the War, but God[225]
will turn the devil's own weapons against himself,
for He will produce a spectacle of unselfish
service such as the world has never seen before.

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what we
are looking at to-day, what we are seeing
portrayed daily before our eyes. We have
never seen such a sight in our time before.
With an unselfish devotion which has been the
admiration of the world, the young men have
flung themselves into the battle. To take our
own nation alone, to imagine that five million
men would have freely offered themselves for
service would have been thought incredible
in the year in which Sir Ian Hamilton delivered
the interesting address to you, which I have
read, on "National Service." Nor is it only
the young men; there is not an idle young
woman in London to-day, and I do not suppose
there is in Birmingham; and as for the children,
a little boy of nine shall speak for them. Asked
whether he minded his beautiful home being
turned into a soldiers' hospital, he replied,
"I love having the soldiers here, Bishop."
We can't go back to our old life after the War.

Even, therefore, without going further, as[226]
we are bound to do presently with the special
teaching of the Christian religion, this conception
of the Potter and the Clay relieves our
minds of its worst fears. God does care for His
human children; this slaughter of one man by
another is not according to His first or even His
ultimate design. He does not stop the mischief
any more than He will pick off with His Hand
obstacles placed to-night in the path of the
Scotch express. He will not stop the wreck of
it by main force, but meanwhile He is not inactive.
The moulding Hand is hard at work;
monuments of fortitude in matrons and wives,
glorious specimens of unrivalled courage in
their sons and husbands, issue from the workshop
every day, and, to use the words of the
Psalmist, "The fierceness of man turns to God's
praise."

III. But now we have a more formidable
task, and that is to meet the charge that the
very existence, and especially the virulence
of the War, constitutes a breakdown of historic
Christianity. I have already admitted the force
of the prima facie case which can be made out
to sustain this argument, but a singular circumstance[227]
may well make us pause before we follow
this specious, but, as I hope to show, shallow
argument.

(1) Japan has always held a very detached
view with regard to Christianity. Owing to
local circumstances for a time a persecutor, our
great ally soon became too enlightened to follow
a policy of persecution, and when, later on, an
alliance was concluded with ourselves, a natural
admiration for the great Western Power which
had become its ally led to at least a respectful
attitude towards the religion which that ally at
heart nominally and officially professed.

Then occurred the War, and here you might
have expected the intelligent and clear-sighted
watcher from a distance to have discovered
the flaw in the religion which its great ally
professed. It is an open secret that it has had
the precisely opposite effect; never were the
Japanese more favourably disposed to give a
hearing to Christianity than they are to-day,
and the reason is not far to seek.

They saw a great nation act up to the principles
of the religion it professed.

If in those critical hours when the decision[228]
hung in the balance we had decided to abide
in our sheepfolds and hear the bleating of the
flocks; if we had decided to remain encircled
by the silver sea and the mightiest navy in the
world, and watch at a safe distance Belgium
ravaged and the coast of France harried by the
German Fleet, Japan would have assessed at its
proper value the Christian sentiments which we
officially professed.

But when it saw its great ally, practically unprepared,
in the cause of the weak against the
strong, in the cause of international honour,
to defend the freedom of the world, fling itself
into the battle, then it bowed its head in
respectful admiration of a nation which did not
wholly in vain profess to follow One "who,
though He was rich, for our sakes became poor,"
and who, again, to use the striking phraseology
of St. Paul, "being in the form of God,
thought it not a thing to be snatched at to
be equal with God, but made himself of no
reputation and took upon the form of a
slave."

It may seem a paradox to say it, but Japan
was clear-sighted enough to see the truth of it,[229]
that with all our inconsistencies and imperfections,
the good old British race never did a
more Christlike thing than when, on August 4th,
1914, it went to war. And surely Japan was
right.

The fallacy of the argument with regard
to the breakdown of Christianity from the
War lies in the words "Christian nations."

Is a nation a Christian nation which adopts
as its governing policy a pagan doctrine?
There may be plenty of individual Christians
in the nation, as no doubt there are, thank
God, in Germany, but no one who has ever
cursorily studied Treitschke or Bernhardi, or the
utterances of the governing class of Germany,
who have imbibed the teaching of such leaders
of thought, can imagine that the nation which
has prepared for this War for forty years, which
has prayed for this Day and longed for it, is
really in this sense a Christian nation.

We are getting tired, terribly tired&mdash;at least
I am&mdash;of hearing of these wretched men who
have succeeded in indoctrinating a great and
powerful and efficient people with a virus
which has turned them into a curse instead of[230]
a blessing to the world. I only bring them in
as part of my defence of Christianity. I say it
is a monstrous misuse of language to talk of the
breakdown of Christianity when what has produced
the War is the exact contrary to Christianity.
There is no such precise contradiction
to the doctrine of the Cross as the doctrine of
the Superman; there is no such absolute contrast
to the principles of the New Testament as
the German War Book.

You can say, and justly say, that in failing to
convert the German nation, Christianity has so
far failed in its world-wide mission, and this I
readily admit; but so has it failed at present to
convert the wild tribes of Central Africa and
the millions of Chinese. All that we claim is that
the principles of Christianity, when accepted and
lived up to, change the face of the world; and
we Christians protest in the strongest way that
a nation which avowedly acts at a great crisis
on anti-Christian principles is not in this sense
a Christian nation at all.

(2) But we go further than this; the progress
of the War has opened the eyes of other watching
neutral nations besides Japan, as to the[231]
value of Christian principles in the conduct of
War.

No one, I suppose, would deny that the
whole idea of the Hague Conference, and the
rules which it issued for the conduct of War,
were a product of Christianity. It was thought
two years ago that, while the Christian religion
might not have so far progressed in the world
as to render War impossible, at least that it
would never be disgraced by the murder and
violation of women and children, by ill-treatment
of prisoners and non-combatants, and the
sinking of innocent merchantmen and trawlers.

Just as in the origin of the War Christianity
justified itself, so it has done in the conduct of
it. Mr. Washburn has described the humanity
with which the great Russian advance
in Poland was conducted&mdash;not a church
damaged, except by accident, not a civilian
injured; whereas, while the world lasts, the
names of Louvain, Aerschott, Lusitania, Cavell,
and Fryatt will cry shame on the apostles of
mere Kultur.

(3) But, on the other hand, let it not be
supposed for a moment that I am speaking as[232]
if our own nation had no national sins to repent
of and no open sores to cure in this great Day
of God.

I am myself "Chief of the Staff" of the
great Mission of Repentance and Hope which
has already begun.

Short-sighted people ask to-day, "If we
have a righteous cause, what have we to repent
of?"&mdash;but the true answer is, "Because we have
a righteous cause, therefore we must repent."
I have spoken of metaphors from the Old
Testament, but there is a fine simile to which I
have not alluded, the simile of the polished
shaft. "He has made me like a polished shaft;
in his quiver hath He hid me." I fully believe
that we are such a polished shaft in the Hand
of God to-day; that He feels down for the
polished shaft which He has prepared by years
of discipline and dearly bought freedom, in
order that He may save through us the Freedom
of the world; but what if we break in His Hand,
as nations have broken before? What if our
drinking habits, curtailed, it is true, for a time
by drastic regulations, but still producing a
drink bill of 181 millions, what if the ravages[233]
of lust in our nation, as shown in the statistics
published by the recent Commission, what if
the constant neglect of God Himself, so rot
the polished shaft that it breaks in the Hand
of God?

It was not a Bishop&mdash;it was one of our leading
Admirals&mdash;who wrote: "Until England is
taken out of her self-satisfaction and complacency,
just so long will the War continue.
When she looks out with humbler eyes and
prayer on her lips, then she can begin to count
the days towards the end."

It is to bring the country back to God,
because it has a righteous cause, which is
the object and aim of the National Mission,
and I bespeak for it your co-operation
in Birmingham, as well as your earnest
prayers.

What we aim at is a new England, a new
British Empire after the War, with all its old
characteristics, with its old humour, and its
love of life, its vigour and its brightness, but
sober, pure, God-fearing; and beyond the
Empire we look for a new Heaven and a new
earth wherein dwelleth righteousness.

[234]

Why for ever shall we have bitterness between
class and class? Why for ever, when this
accursed Prussian spirit of militarism is laid in
the dust for ever, shall we have the constant
menace of War? Why should there not grow
to be a spirit of brotherhood in the world, when
not only class and class, but nation and nation,
shall agree to share the good things with which
God filled the kindly earth which He has provided
as a home for His children?

(4) But it would be impossible to leave the
subject of the War and Religion without
alluding to the part religion plays in throwing
a bright light on Death. I have no doubt that
I am speaking to many to-day who have given
their best and brightest in this greatest cause
ever fought on earth, who, to paraphrase the
famous words of Ruskin, "will never see the
sun rise without thinking of those graves it first
gilds in Gallipoli, and who will never see the
flowers bloom in spring without thinking over
whose dear bodies bloom to-day the wild
flowers of Flanders." When I, an unmarried
man, think to-day of my own spiritual sons,
dear to me as if they were my own boys, who[235]
have month by month gone to their death, or
come home maimed for life, it is almost more
than I can bear, and I can do something more
than merely sympathize with the father and
mother who have given one, two, three, and I
have known even four sons in the same cause.
I do more than sympathize: I feel with them;
I suffer with them.

And so with all the young widows whose
life's hopes have been cut short in an instant.
I live in the midst of the mourners every day.
But could I do any good, ladies and gentlemen,
without religion?

I am absolutely certain that I could not. It
is a mistake, even with religion, to speak as if
death was not death, and pain not pain. One
of the most touching things ever said to me was
this: "We come to you, Bishop, because you
do not underrate human sorrow."

Underrate it! Why! my wonder and admiration
is that they bear it as bravely as they
do. Never again to have the cheery letter;
never again in this world to see the dear face;
never again to feel the loving arms around them
and the strong embrace.

[236]

But, while religion does not pretend to do
away with pain and sorrow, it is the one thing
which makes it tolerable, which lights up the
darkness of death.

"As Christ died for the world, and my two
boys have died in their humble way for the
world, may I not consider," wrote a brave
Colonel who had lost his two boys in one
week, "that Christ looks upon them as His
comrades in arms?"

I need hardly say what my reply was.
Why! to my mind, the world is being redeemed
by precious blood again, and this precious
blood mingles with the Precious Blood which
flowed on Calvary, and becomes part of the
redemption of the world.

Nothing really cheers the mourners as much
as to feel that their beloved ones have made
a noble sacrifice, and have not made it in
vain. And with that, religion brings in the
blessed hope, nay, certainty, of seeing them
again.

How many have I cheered this year with Miss
Katharine Tynan's poem called "The Flower
of Youth"?&mdash;

[237]


"Lest Heaven be for the greybeards hoary,
God, who made boys for His delight,
Goes in earth's hour of grief and glory,
And calls the boys in from the night.
As they come trooping from the War
Our skies have many a new gold star."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


The poem is too long to quote in full, but
it ends with these beautiful lines:


"Oh! if the sonless mothers weeping,
The widowed girls, could look inside
The Country which hath them in keeping
Who went to the great War and died,
They would rise and take their mourning off,
Praise God, and say, 'He has enough.'"


But we have no certainty of this without
religion, and, as I am conscientiously bound to
say myself, without the Christian religion.

It is very interesting and very helpful that
scientific men, one of whom is so leading a
light in Birmingham, believe that on scientific
grounds they have reason to believe in an
existence beyond the grave, and in the continuity
of personality. It used to help me
greatly in contesting the assertion that all
scientific men were opposed to all the tenets of[238]
religion; but as one who has often to be with
the dying, as well as the mourners, I should like
to bear witness to the extreme value of the
belief in a real resurrection from the dead, such
as the Christian Church has commemorated
for two thousand years at Easter.

I should feel it quite out of place, of course,
to argue with regard to its truth here and now,
but to a simple mind&mdash;and, of course, religion
has to be adapted to simple minds throughout
the world, which largely outnumber subtle ones&mdash;a
single great Event has ten times the power
of any amount of theory; and there cannot be
a doubt that it is a belief in the Central Fact
of the Christian religion which is as a matter of
fact redeeming the world of mourners from
despair to-day&mdash;nay, more than that, filling
them with a bright and radiant hope, and a
glorious fortitude to hold on with the courage
of their own soldier sons or soldier husbands
"until the day dawns and the shadows flee
away."

Well then, I must just leave the matter there.
I have never written such a long address in my
life, and don't expect ever to do so again; but[239]
then it is only once in one's life one has the
honour of being President of the Birmingham
and Midland Institute.

I hope that I have made at least my main
points clear. We who stand for Religion are not
afraid of a discussion on "The War and Religion."
We do not for a moment think that the
War has disproved the truth of Religion, and
still less of the Christian Religion; on the
contrary, we believe that it has demonstrated
its value and brought into clearer light its
hidden depths; and we go further&mdash;we say,
that if War is to cease, we must have not less
but more religion, for we hope to see an old
prophecy one day fulfilled, "They shall not
hurt or destroy in all My holy mountains, for
the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of
the Lord as the waters cover the seas."

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
