      AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF CHARLES BRADLAUGH.
    </h1>
    <h3>
      A PAGE OF HIS LIFE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      At the request of many friends, and by way of farewell address on leaving
      for America, I, for the first time in my life, pen a partial
      autobiographical sketch. I do not pretend that the narrative will be a
      complete picture of my life, I only vouch the accuracy of the facts so far
      as I state them. I have not the right in some cases to state political
      occurrences in which others now living are involved, nor have I the
      courage of Jean Jacques Rousseau, to photograph my inner life. I shall
      therefore state little the public may not already know. I was born on the
      26th September, 1833, in a small house in Bacchus Walk, Hoxton. My father
      was a solicitor's clerk with a very poor salary, which he supplemented by
      law writing. He was an extremely industrious man, and a splendid penman. I
      never had the opportunity of judging his tastes or thoughts, outside his
      daily labors, except in one respect, in which I have followed in his
      footsteps. He was passionately fond of angling. Until 1848 my life needs
      little relation. My schooling, like that of most poor men's children, was
      small in quantity, and, except as to the three R's, indifferent in
      quality. I remember at seven years of age being at a national school in
      Abbey Street, Bethnel Green; between seven and nine I was at another small
      private school in the same neighborhood, and my "education" was completed
      before I was eleven years of age at a boys' school in Coalharbor Street,
      Hackney Road. When about twelve years of age I was first employed as
      errand lad in the solicitor's office where my father remained his whole
      life through. After a little more than two years in this occupation, I
      became wharf clerk and cashier to a firm of coal merchants in Britannia
      Fields, City Road. While in their employment the excitement of the
      Chartist movement was at its height in England, and the authorities,
      frightened by the then huge continental revolution wave, were preparing
      for the prosecution of some of the leaders among the Chartists. Meetings
      used to be held almost continuously all day on Sunday, and every
      week-night in the open air on Bonner's Fields, near where the Consumption
      Hospital now stands. These meetings were in knots from fifty to five
      hundred, sometimes many more, and were occupied chiefly in discussions on
      theological, social, and political questions, any bystander taking part.
      The curiosity of a lad took me occasionally in the week evenings to the
      Bonner's Fields gatherings. On the Sunday I, as a member of the Church of
      England, was fully occupied as a Sunday-school teacher. This last-named
      fashion of passing Sunday was broken suddenly. The Bishop of London was
      announced to hold a confirmation in Bethnal Green. The incumbent of St.
      Peter's, Hackney Road, the district in which I resided, was one John
      Graham Packer, and he, desiring to make a good figure when the Bishop
      came, pressed me to prepare for confirmation, so as to answer any question
      the Bishop might put. I studied a little the Thirty-nine Articles of the
      Church of England, and the four Gospels, and came to the conclusion that
      they differed. I ventured to write the Rev. Mr. Packer a respectful
      letter, asking him for aid and explanation. All he did was to denounce my
      letter to my parents as Atheistical, although at that time I should have
      shuddered at the very notion of becoming an Atheist, and he suspended me
      for three months from my office of Sunday-school teacher. This left me my
      Sundays free, for I did not like to go to church while suspended from my
      teacher's duty, and I, instead, went to Bonner's Fields, at first to
      listen, but soon to take part in some of the discussions which were then
      always pending there.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the commencement I spoke on the orthodox Christian side, but after a
      debate with Mr. J. Savage, in the Warner Place Hall, in 1849, on the
      "Inspiration of the bible," I found that my views were getting very much
      tinged with Freethought, and in the winter of that year, at the
      instigation of Mr. Packer, to whom I had submitted the "Diegesis" of
      Robert Taylor, I&mdash;having become a teetotaler, which in his view
      brought out my infidel tendencies still more vigorously&mdash;had three
      days given me by my employers, after consultation with my father, to
      "change my opinions or lose my situation." I am inclined to think now that
      the threat was never intended to have been enforced, but was used to
      terrify me into submission. At that time I hardly knew what, if any,
      opinions I had, but the result was that sooner than make a show of
      recanting, I left home and situation on the third day, and never returned
      to either.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was always a very fluent speaker, and now lectured frequently at the
      Temperance Hall, Warner Place, Hackney Road, at the small Hall in Philpot
      Street, and in the open air in Bonner's Fields, where at last on Sunday
      afternoons scores of hundreds congregated to hear me. My views were then
      Deistical, but rapidly tending to the more extreme phase in which they
      ultimately settled. I now took part in all the gatherings held in London
      on behalf of the Poles and Hungarians, and actually fancied that I could
      write poetry on Kossuth and Mazzini.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this time I made the acquaintance of my friend and co-worker,
      Mr. Austin Holyoake, at his printing office in Queen's Head Passage, and I
      remember him taking me to John Street Institution, where, at one of the
      pleasant Saturday evening gatherings, I met the late Mrs. Emma Martin. At
      Mr. Austin Holyoake's request, Mr. George Jacob Holyoake, to my great
      delight, presided at one of my lectures in Philpot Street, and I felt
      special interest in the number of the <i>Reasoner</i> which contained a
      brief reference to myself and that lecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote my first pamphlet, "A Few Words on the Christian's Creed," about
      the middle of 1850, and was honored by Dr. Campbell of the <i>British
      Banner</i> with a leading article vigorously assailing me for the lectures
      I had then delivered. After leaving home I was chiefly sheltered by Mrs.
      Sharpies Carlile, with whose children, Hypatia, Theophila, and Julian, I
      shared such comforts as were at her disposal. Here I studied hard
      everything which came in my way, picking up a little Hebrew and an
      imperfect smattering of other tongues. I tried to earn my living as a coal
      merchant, but at sixteen, and without one farthing in my pocket, the
      business was not extensive enough to be profitable. I got very poor, and
      at that time was also very proud. A subscription offered me by a few
      Freethinkers shocked me, and awakened me to a sense of my poverty; so
      telling no one where I was going, I went away, and on the 17th of
      December, 1850, was, after some difficulty, enlisted in the Seventh
      Dragoon Guards. With this corps I remained until October, 1853, being
      ultimately appointed orderly-room clerk; the regiment, during the whole of
      the time I remained in it, being quartered in Ireland. While I was in the
      regiment I was a teetotaler, and used often to lecture to the men in the
      barrack-room at night, and I have more than once broken out of Portobello
      barracks to deliver teetotal speeches in the small French Street Hall,
      Dublin. Many times have I spoken there in my scarlet jacket, between James
      Haughton and the good old father, the Rev. Dr. Spratt, a Roman Catholic
      priest, then very active in the cause of temperance. While I was in the
      regiment my father died, and in the summer of 1853 an aunt's death left me
      a small sum, out of which I purchased my discharge, and returned to
      England, to aid in the maintenance of my mother and family.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have now no time for the full story of my army life, which, however, I
      may tell some day. Before I left the regiment I had won the esteem of most
      of the privates, and of some of the officers. I quitted the regiment with
      a "very good character" from the Colonel, but I am bound to add, that the
      Captain would not have concurred in this character had he had any voice in
      the matter. The Lieutenant-Colonel, C. P. Ainslie, earned an eternal right
      to grateful mention at my hands by his gentlemanly and considerate
      treatment. I can not say the same for my Captain, who did his best to send
      me to jail, and whom I have not yet quite forgiven.
    </p>
    <p>
      On returning to civilian life I obtained employment in the daytime with a
      solicitor named Rogers, and in the evening as clerk to a Building Society;
      and soon after entering this employ I began again to write and speak, and
      it was then I, to in some degree avoid the efforts which were afterward
      made to ruin me, took the name "Iconoclast," under which all my
      anti-theological work down to 1868 was done. I give Mr. Rogers' name now
      for he is dead, and malice can not injure him. Many anonymous letters were
      sent to him to warn him of my irreligious opinions; he treated them all
      with contempt, only asking me not to let my propaganda become an injury to
      his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after my discharge from the army I had a curious adventure. While I
      was away a number of poor men had subscribed their funds together and had
      erected a Working Man's Hall, in Goldsmith's Row, Hackney Road. Not having
      any legal advice, it turned out that they had been entrapped into erecting
      their building on freehold ground without any lease or conveyance from the
      freeholder, who asserted his legal right to the building. The men
      consulted me, and finding that under the Statute of Frauds they had no
      remedy, I recommended them to offer a penalty rent of £20 a year. This
      being refused, I constituted myself into a law court, and without any riot
      or breach of the peace, I, with the assistance of a hundred stout men,
      took every brick of the building bodily away, and divided the materials,
      so far as was possible, among the proper owners. I think I can see now the
      disappointed rascal of a freeholder when he only had his bare soil left
      once more. He did not escape unpunished, for to encourage the others to
      contribute, he had invested some few pounds in the building. He had been
      too clever; he had relied on the letter of the law, and I beat him with a
      version of common-sense justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lectured once or twice a week in the small Philpot Street Hall, very
      often then in the Hall of Science, City Road, and then in the old John
      Street Institution, until I won myself a name in the party throughout the
      country. In 1855 had my first notable adventure with the authorities in
      reference to the right of meeting in Hyde Park, and subsequently gave
      evidence before the Royal Commission ordered by the House of Commons,
      presided over by the Right Hon. Stuart Wortley. I was very proud that day
      at Westminster, when, at the conclusion of my testimony against the
      authorities, the Commissioner publicly thanked me, and the people who
      crowded the Court of Exchequer cheered me, for the manner in which I
      denied the right of Sir Richard Mayne, the then Chief Commissioner of
      Police, to issue the notices forbidding the people to meet in the Park.
      This was the first step in a course in which I have never flinched or
      wavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1855 I undertook, with others, the publication of a series of papers,
      entitled "Half-Hours with Freethinkers," the late John Watts being one of
      my co-workers. I also by myself commenced the publication of my
      "Commentary on the Pentateuch," which has since been entirely re-written
      and now forms my "Bible: what it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      During the autumn of 18571 paid my first lecture visit to Northampton.
      Early in 1858, when Mr. Edward Truelove was suddenly arrested for
      publishing the pamphlet, "Is Tyrannicide Justifiable?" I became Honorary
      Secretary to the Defense, and was at the same time associated with the
      conduct of the defense of Simon Bernard, who was arrested at the
      instigation of the French Government for alleged complicity in the Orsini
      tragedy. It was at this period I gained the friendship of poor Bernard,
      which, without diminution, retained until he died; and also the valued
      frendship of Thomas Allsop, which I still preserve. My associations were
      from thenceforward such as to encourage in me a strong and bitter feeling
      against the late Emperor Napoleon. While he was in power I hated him, and
      never lost an opportunity of working against him until the <i>decheance</i>
      came. I am not sure now that I always judged him fairly; but nothing, I
      think, could have tempted me to either write or speak of him with
      friendliness during his life. <i>Le sang de mes amis etait sur son ame</i>.
      Now that the tomb covers his remains, my hatred has ceased; but no other
      feeling has arisen in its place. Should any of his family seek to resume
      the Imperial purple, I should remain true to my political declarations of
      sixteen years since, and should exert myself to the uttermost to prevent
      France falling under another Empire. I write this with much sadness, as
      1870 to 1873 have dispelled some of my illusions held firmly during the
      fifteen years which preceded. I had believed in such men as Louis Blanc,
      Lodru Rollin, Victor Hugo, as possible statesmen of France. I was
      mistaken. They were writers, talkers, and poets; good men to ride on the
      stream, or to drown in honest protest, but lacking force to swim against,
      or turn back, the tide by the might of their will. I had believed too in a
      Republican France, which is yet only in the womb of time, to be born after
      many pangs and sore travailing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1859 I saw Joseph Mazzini for the first time, and remained on terms of
      communication with the great Italian patriot until the year 1869, from
      time to time bringing him correspondence from Italy, where my business
      sometimes took me. After 1869 we found ourselves holding diverse opinions
      on the Franco-Prussian question&mdash;Mazzini went for Prussia, I for
      France&mdash;and I never saw him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In June, 1858, I held my first public formal theological debate with the
      Rev. Brewin Grant, B.A., at that time a Dissenting Minister at Sheffield.
      Mr. Grant was then a man of some ability, and if he could have forgotten
      his aptitudes as a circus jester, would have been a redoubtable
      antagonist. During this year I was elected President of the London Secular
      Society, in lieu of Mr. George Jacob Holyoake, who had theretofore led the
      English Free-thought party, but who has of late years devoted himself more
      completely to general journalistic work.
    </p>
    <p>
      In November, 1858, I commenced editorial duties with the <i>Investigator</i>,
      formerly conducted by the late Robert Cooper, which I continued until
      August, 1859. It had but a small circulation, and was financially a very
      great failure. For the encouragement of young propagandists, I may here
      insert a little anecdote of my early lecturing experience. I had lectured
      in Edinburgh in mid-winter, the audience was small, the profits
      microscopical. I, alter paying my bill at the Temperance Hotel, where I
      then stayed, had only a few shillings more than my Parliamentary fare to
      Bolton, where I was next to lecture. I was out of bed at five on a
      freezing morning, and could have no breakfast, as the people were not up.
      I carried my luggage (a big tin box, corded round, which then held books
      and clothes, and a small black bag), for I could not spare any of my
      scanty cash for a conveyance or porter. The train from Edinburgh being
      delayed by a severe snow-storm, the corresponding Parliamentary had left
      Carlisle long before our arrival. In order to reach Bolton in time for my
      lecture, I had to book by a quick train, starting in about three-quarters
      of an hour, but could only book to Preston, as the increased fare took all
      my money, except 4 1/2d. With this small sum I could get no refreshment in
      the station, but in a little shop in the street outside I got a mug of tea
      and a little hot meat pie. From Preston, I got with great difficulty on to
      Bolton, handing my black bag to the station-master there as security for
      my fare from Preston, until the morning. I arrived in Bolton about quarter
      to eight; the lecture commenced at eight, and I, having barely time to run
      to my lodgings, and wash and change, went onto the platform cold and
      hungry. I shall never forget that lecture; it was in an old Unitarian
      Chapel. We had no gas, the building seemed full of a foggy mist, and was
      imperfectly lit with candles. Everything appeared cold, cheerless, and
      gloomy. The most amusing feature was that an opponent, endowed with extra
      piety and forbearance, chose that evening to specially attack me for the
      money-making and easy life I was leading. Peace to that opponent's memory,
      I have never seen him since. It was while in Scotland on this journey I
      made the acquaintance, and ultimately won the frendship, of the late
      Alexander Campbell, of Glasgow&mdash;a generous, kindly-hearted old
      Socialist Missionary, who, at a time when others were hostile, spoke
      encouragingly to me, and who afterward worked with me for a long period on
      this journal [<i>The National Reformer</i>]. Occasionally the lectures
      were interfered with by the authorities, but this happened oftener in the
      provinces than in London. In March, 1859, I was to have lectured in Saint
      Martin's Hall on "Louis Napoleon," but the Government&mdash;on a
      remonstrance by Count Walewski, as to language used at a previous meeting,
      at which I had presided for Dr. Bernard&mdash;interfered; the hall was
      garrisoned by police, and the lecture prevented. Mr. Hullah, the then
      proprietor, being indemnified by the authorities, paid damages for his
      breach of contract, to avoid a suit which I at once commenced against him.
      Later in the same month I held a debate in Northampton with Mr. John
      Bowes, a rather heavy, but well-meaning, old gentleman, utterly unfitted
      for platform controversy. The press now began to deal with me tolerably
      freely, and I find "boy," "young man," and "juvenile appearance" very
      frequent in the comments. My want of education was an especial matter for
      hostile criticism, the more particularly so when the writer had neither
      heard nor seen me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Discussions now grew on me so thick and fast that even some of the most
      important debates may perhaps escape notice in this imperfect chronicling.
      At Sheffield I debated with a Reverend Dr. Mensor, who styled himself a
      Jewish Rabbi. He was then in the process of gaining admission to the
      Church of England, and had been put forward to show my want of
      scholarship. We both scrawled Hebrew characters for four nights on a black
      board, to the delight and mystification of the audience, who gave me
      credit for erudition, because I chalked the square letter characters with
      tolerable rapidity and clearness. At Glasgow I debated with a Mr. Court,
      representing the Glasgow Protestant Association, a glib-tongued
      missionary, who has since gone to the bad; at Paisley with a Mr. Smart, a
      very gentlemanly antagonist; and at Halifax with the Rev. T. D. Matthias,
      a Welsh Baptist Minister, unquestionably very sincere. All these were
      formal debates, and were reported with tolerable fullness in the various
      journals. In the early part of 1860 I, aided by my friends at Sheffield,
      Halifax, and other parts of England, projected the <i>National Reformer</i>
      in small shares. Unfortunately just after the issue of its prospectus,
      Joseph Barker returned from America, and was associated with me in the
      editorship. The arrangement was peculiar, Mr. Barker editing the first
      half of the paper and I the second. It was not precisely a happy union,
      and the unnatural alliance came to an end in a very brief period. In
      August.1861, I officially parted company with Joseph Barker as editor. We
      had been practically divorced for months before: the first part of the
      paper usually contained abuse of those who wrote in the second half. He
      came to me originally at Sheffield, pretending to be an Atheist and a
      Republican, and soon after pretended to be a Christian, and spoke in favor
      of slavery. I am sometimes doubtful as to how far Mr. Barker deluded
      himself, as well as others, in his various changes of theological and
      political opinions. If he had had the slightest thoroughness in his
      character, he would have been a great man; as it is, he is only a great
      turn-coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      In June, 1860, I debated again with the Reverend Brewin Grant, every
      Monday for four weeks, at Bradford, and during this debate had a narrow
      escape of my life. In one of my journeys to London, the great Northern
      train ran through the station at King's Cross, and many persons were
      seriously injured. I got off with some trifling bruises and a severe
      shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garibaldi having at this time made his famous Marsala effort, I delivered
      a series of lectures in his aid, and am happy to be able to record that,
      though at that time very poor, I sent him one hundred guineas as my
      contribution by my tongue. This money was chiefly sent through W. H.
      Ashurst, Esq., now Solicitor to the General Post Office, and among the
      letters I preserve I have one of thanks from "G. Garibaldi," for what I
      was then doing for Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this year I debated for four nights with Dr. Brindley, an old
      antagonist of the Socialists, at Oldham; for two nights with the Rev. Dr.
      Baylee, the President of St. Aidan's College, at Birkenhead, where a
      Church of England curate manufactory was for some time carried on; and for
      two nights with the Rev. Dr. Rutherford, of Newcastle. Dr. Rutherford has
      since so identified himself with the cause of the Tyneside workers, that I
      read with regret any harsh words that escaped me in that debate. Although
      during late years I have managed to keep all my meetings free from
      violence or disorder, this was not always so. In October, 1860, I paid my
      first visit to Wigan, and certainly lectured there under considerable
      difficulty, and incurred personal clanger, the resident clergy actually
      inciting the populace to physical violence, and part destruction of the
      building I lectured in. I, however, supported by one courageous woman and
      her husband, persevered, and despite bricks and kicks, visited Wigan again
      and again, until I had, <i>bon gre malgre</i> improved the manners and
      customs of the people, so that now 1 am a welcome speaker there. I could
      not improve the morals of the clergy, as the public journals have recently
      shown, but that was their misfortune not my fault. In the winter of 1860,
      I held two formal debates in Wigan, all of which were fully reported in
      the local journals; one with Mr. Hutchings, a respectable Nonconformist
      layman, and the other with the Rev. Woodville Woodman, a Swedenborgian
      divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in 1861 I visited Guernsey in consequence of an attempt made by the
      Law Courts of the Island to enforce the blasphemy laws against a Mr.
      Stephen Bendall, who had distributed some or my pamphlets to the
      Guernseyites, and had been condemned to imprisonment in default of finding
      sureties not to repeat the offense. Not daring to prosecute me, although
      challenged in writing, the authorities permitted drink and leave of
      absence to be given to soldiers in the garrison on condition they would
      try to prevent the lecture, and the house in which I lectured was broken
      into by a drunken and pious mob, shouting "Kill the Infidel." My
      antagonists were fortunately as cowardly as they were intolerant, and I
      succeeded in quelling the riot, delivering my lecture in spite of all
      opposition, although considerable damage was done to the building.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after this I visited Plymouth, where the Young Men's Christian
      Association arranged to prosecute me. They were, however, a little too
      hasty, and had me arrested at an open air meeting when I had scarcely
      commenced my speech, having only uttered the words: "Friends, I am about
      to address you on the bible." Having locked me up all night, and refused
      bail, it was found by their legal adviser that a blunder had been
      committed, and a charge of "exciting a breach of the peace, and assaulting
      the constable in the execution of his duty," was manufactured. It was
      tolerably amusing to see the number of dinners, suppers, and breakfasts,
      all accompanied with pots or cups of Devonshire cream, sent in to the
      Devonport Lock-up, where I was confined, by various friends who wanted to
      show their sympathy. The invented charge, though well sworn to, broke down
      after two days' hearing, under the severe cross-examination to which I
      subjected the witnesses. I defended myself, two lawyers appeared against
      me, and seven magistrates sat on the bench, predetermined to convict me.
      Finding that the evidence of the whole of the witnesses whom I wished to
      call was to be objected to, because un-believers in hell were then
      incompetent as witnesses according to English law, I am pleased to say
      that several Nonconformists, disgusted with the bigotry and pious perjury
      of my prosecutors, came forward. The result was a triumphant victory, and
      a certificate of dismissal, which I wrung from the reluctant bench of
      great unpaid. I was not yet satisfied; some of the magistrates had tried
      to browbeat me, and I announced in court that I would deliver the lecture
      I had been prevented from delivering to an audience assembled in the
      borough, and that I should sue at law the Superintendent of Police who had
      arrested me. The first portion of my defiance was the most difficult to
      give effect to; not a hall could be hired in Devonport, and nearly all the
      convenient open land being under military jurisdiction, it was impossible
      to procure the tenancy of a field for an open-air meeting. I, however,
      fulfilled my promise, and despite the police and military authorities
      combined, delivered my lecture to an audience assembled in their very
      teeth. Devonport, Stonehouse, and Plymouth form one garrisoned and
      fortified town, divided by the River Tamar. All the water to the sea is
      under the separate jurisdiction of Saltash, some miles distant. I obtained
      a large boat on which a temporary platform was built, and this boat was
      quietly moored in the River Tamar on the Devonport side, about two fathoms
      from the shore. Placards were issued stating that, acting under legal
      advice, I should address the meeting and deliver the prevented lecture
      "near to the Devonport Park Gates." Overwhelming force was prepared by the
      Devonport authorities, and having already erred by too great haste, this
      time they determined to let me fairly commence my lecture before they
      arrested me. To their horror I quietly walked past the Park Gates where
      the crowd was waiting, and passing down a by-lane to the river side,
      stepped into a little boat, was rowed to the large one, and then delivered
      my lecture, the audience who had followed me standing on an open wharf,
      all within the jurisdiction of the Borough of Devonport, and I being about
      9 feet outside the borough. The face of the Mayor ready to read the riot
      act, the superintendent with twenty-eight picked policemen to make sure or
      my arrest, and a military force in readiness to overawe any popular
      demonstration&mdash;all these were sights to remember. I am afraid the
      Devonport Young Men's Christian Association did not limit themselves to
      prayers and blessings on that famous Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I had promised, the authorities refusing any apology for the wrongful
      arrest, I commenced an action against Superintendent Edwards, by whom I
      had been taken into custody. The borough magistrates indemnified their
      officer and found funds to resist me. I fought with very little help save
      from one tried, though anonymous friend, for Joseph Barker, my co-editor,
      but not co-worker, in our own paper, discouraged any pecuniary support.
      The cause was made a special jury one, and came on for trial at Exeter
      Assizes. Unfortunately I was persuaded to brief counsel, and Sir Robert
      Collier, my leader, commenced his speech with an expression of sorrow for
      my opinions. This damaged me very much, although I won the case easily
      after a long trial. The jury, composed of Devonshire landowners, only gave
      me a farthing damages, and Mr. Baron Channell refused to certify for
      costs. I was determined not to let the matter rest here, and myself
      carried it to the Court <i>in Banco</i>, where I argued it in person for
      two whole days, before Lord Chief Justice Erie and a full bench of Judges.
      Although I did not succeed in improving my own position, I raised public
      opinion in favor of free speech, and the enormous costs incurred by the
      borough authorities, and which they had to bear, have deterred them from
      ever again interfering either with my lectures or those of any other
      speaker, and I now have crowded audiences in the finest hall whenever I
      visit the three towns. These proceedings cost me several hundred pounds,
      and burdened me with a debt which took long clearing off.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1802, I held a four nights' discussion with a Dissenting clergyman, the
      Rev. W. Barker. My opponent was probably one of the most able and
      straightforward among my numerous antagonists. About this time a severe
      attack of acute rheumatism prostrated me, and having soon after to visit
      Italy, I, at first under medical advice, adopted the habit of drinking the
      light Continental wines, and although continuing an advocate of sobriety,
      I naturally ceased to take part in any teetotal gatherings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the struggle between the Northern and Southern States of America, my
      advocacy and sympathies went with what I am glad to say was the feeling of
      the great mass of the English people&mdash;in favor of the North; and my
      esteemed friend, and then contributor, W. E. Adams, furnished most
      valuable aid with his pen in the enlightenment of public opinion, at a
      time when many of our aristocracy were openly exulting in what they
      conceived to be the probable break-up of the United States Republic.
      During the Lancashire cotton famine I lectured several times in aid of the
      fund.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began now also to assume a much more prominent position in the various
      English political movements, and especially to speak on the Irish Church
      and Irish Land questions. On the Irish questions, I owe much to my late
      co-worker and contributor, poor Peter Fox Andre, a thoroughly honest and
      whole-souled man, whose pen was always on the side of struggling
      nationalities.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the disadvantages connected with a public career is, that every
      vile scoundrel who is too cowardly to face you openly can libel you
      anonymously. I have had, I think, my full share of this kind of annoyance.
      Most of the slanders I have treated with utter contempt, and if I had
      alone consulted my own feelings, should probably never have pursued any
      other course. Twice, however, I have had recourse to the judgment of the
      law&mdash;once in the case of a clergyman of the Church of England, who
      indulged in a foul libel affecting my wife and children. This fellow I
      compelled to retract every word he had uttered, and to pay £100, which,
      after deducting the costs, was divided among various charitable
      institutions. The reverend libeler wrote me an abject letter, begging me
      not to ruin his prospects in the Church by publishing his name; I
      consented, and he has since repaid my mercy by losing no opportunity of
      being offensive. He is a prominent contributor to the <i>Rock</i>, and a
      fierce ultra-Protestant. He must have greater confidence in my honor than
      in his own, or fear of exposure would compel him to greater reticence. The
      other case arose during the election, and will be dealt with in its proper
      order.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was my fortune to be associated with the Reform League from its
      earliest moments until its dissolution. It is hardly worth while to repeat
      the almost stereotyped story of the successful struggle made by the League
      for Parliamentary Reform. E. Beales, Esq., was the President of the
      League, and I was one of its Vice-Presidents, and continued nearly the
      whole time of its existence a member of its executive. The whole of my
      services and journeys were given to the League without the slightest
      remuneration, and I repeatedly, and according to my means, contributed to
      its funds. When I resigned my position on the executive I received from
      Mr. George Howell, the Secretary, and from Mr. Beales, the President, the
      most touching and flattering letters as to what Mr. Beales was pleased to
      describe as the loyalty and utility of my services to the League. Mr.
      George Howell concluded a long letter as follows: "Be pleased to accept my
      assurance of sincere regards for your manly courage, consistent and
      honorable conduct in our cause, and for your kindly consideration for
      myself as Secretary of this great movement on all occasions." These
      letters have additional value from the fact that Mr. Beales, whom I
      sincerely respect, differs widely from me in matters of faith, and Mr.
      Howell is, fortunately, far from having any friendly feeling toward me. It
      was while on the Executive of this League that I first became intimately
      acquainted with Mr. George Odger, and had reason to be pleased with the
      straightforward course he pursued, and the honest work he did as one of
      the Executive Committee. Mr. John Baxter Langley and Mr. R. A. Cooper were
      also among my most prominent co-workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      My sympathy with Ireland, and open advocacy of justice for the Irish,
      nearly brought me into serious trouble. Some who were afterward indicted
      as the chiefs of the so-called Fenian movement, came to me for advice. So
      much I see others have written, and the rest of this portion of my
      autobiography I may write some day. At present there are men not out of
      danger whom careless words might imperil, and as regards myself I shall
      not be guilty of the folly of printing language which a government might
      use against me. My pamphlet on the Irish Question, published in 1866, won
      a voluntary letter of warm approval from Mr. Gladstone, the only friendly
      writing I ever received from him in my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Huddersfield, the Philosophical Hall having been duly hired for my
      lectures, pious influence was brought to bear on the lessee to induce him
      to break the contract. Fortunately what in law amounted to possession had
      been given, and on the doors being locked against me, I broke them open,
      and delivered my lecture to a crowded and most orderly audience. I was
      arrested, and an attempt was made to prosecute me before the Huddersfield
      magistrates; but I defended myself with success, and defeated with ease
      the Conservative solicitor, N. Learoyd, who had been specially retained to
      insure my committal to jail.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1868 I entered into a contest with the Conservative Government which,
      having been continued by the Gladstone Government, finished in 1869 with a
      complete victory for myself. According to the then law every newspaper was
      required to give sureties to the extent of £800 against blasphemous or
      seditious libel. I had never offered to give these sureties, as they would
      have probably been liable to forfeiture about once a month. In March,
      1868, the Disraeli Government insisted on my compliance with the law. I
      refused. The Government then required me to stop my paper. I printed on
      the next issue, "Printed in Defiance of Her Majesty's Government." I was
      then served with an Attorney-General's information, containing numerous
      counts, and seeking to recover enormous penalties. I determined to be my
      own barrister, and while availing myself in consultation of the best legal
      advice, I always argued my own case. The interlocutory hearings before the
      Judges in Chambers were numerous, for I took objection to nearly every
      step made by the government, and I nearly always succeeded. I also brought
      the matter before Parliament, being specially backed in this by Mr. Milner
      Gibson, Mr. John Stuart Mill, and Mr. E. H. J. Crawford. When the
      information was called on for trial in a crowded court before Mr. Baron
      Martin, the Government backed out, and declined to make a jury; so the
      prosecution fell to the ground. Strange to say, it was renewed by the
      Gladstone Government, who had the coolness to offer me, by the mouth of
      Attorney-General Collier, that they would not enforce any penalties if I
      would stop the paper, and admit that I was in the wrong. This I declined,
      and the prosecution now came on for trial before Baron Bramwell and a
      special jury. Against me were the Attorney-General, Sir R. Collier, the
      Solicitor-General, Sir J. D. Coleridge, and Mr. Crompton Hutton. I found
      that these legal worthies were blundering in their conduct of the trial,
      and at <i>nisi prius</i> I let them obtain a verdict, which however, I
      reversed on purely technical grounds, after a long argument, which I
      sustained before Lord Chief Baron Kelly and a full court sitting in Banco.
      Having miserably failed to enforce the law against me, the Government
      repealed the statute, and I can boast that I got rid of the last shackle
      of the obnoxious English press laws. Mr. J. S. Mill wrote me: "You have
      gained a very honorable success in obtaining a repeal of the mischievous
      Act by your persevering resistance." The Government, although beaten,
      refused to reimburse me any portion of the large outlay incurred in
      fighting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has always been my ambition to enter Parliament, and at the General
      Election for 1808 I, for the first time, entered the arena as a candidate.
      I was beaten; but this is scarcely wonderful. I had all the journals in
      England except three against me. Every idle or virulent tale which folly
      could distort or calumny invent was used against me. Despite all, I polled
      nearly 1,100 votes, and I obtained unasked, but not ungratefully listened
      to, the public acknowledgments from the Mayor of the borough, also from
      one of my competitors, Mr. Charles Gilpin, as to the loyal manner in which
      I had fought the contest through.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the election struggle libels rained from all sides. One by the late
      Mr Capper, M. P., seeking reelection at Sandwich, was the monstrous story,
      that in the open square at Northampton I had taken out my watch and defied
      God to show his power by striking me dead in five minutes. Challenged for
      his authority Mr. Capper pretended to have heard the story from Mr. C.
      Gilpin, M. P., who indignantly denied being any party to the falsehood. I
      insisted on an apology from Mr. Capper, which being refused I sued him,
      but he died soon after the writ was served. The story was not an original
      invention by Mr. Capper; it had been reported of Abner Kneeland thirty
      years before, and is still a favorite one with pious missionaries at
      street corners. A still more outrageous slander was inserted in the <i>Razor</i>,
      a pseudo-comic weekly. I compelled this journal to give a full apology,
      but not until after two years' litigation, and a new trial had been
      ordered. When obliged to recant, the Christian proprietor became
      insolvent, to avoid payment of the costs. Unfortunately born poor, my life
      had been one continued struggle, and the burden of my indebtedness was
      sorely swollen in this and similar contests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably the most severe, and to me certainly the most costly, struggle
      has been on the oath question. Formerly it was a fatal objection against
      the competency of a witness who did not believe in a Deity and in a future
      state of rewards and punishments. Several attempts had been made to alter
      the law, but they had all failed; and indeed Sir J. Trevelyan's measures
      only provided for affirmation, and did not seek to abolish the
      incompetency. In a case in which I was plaintiff in the Court of Common
      Pleas, my evidence was objected to, and I determined to fight the matter
      through every possible court, and to get the law changed if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      I personally argued the case before Lord Chief Justice Bovill and a full
      Bench, in the Court of Common Pleas, and with the aid of the present Mr.
      Justice Denman and the late Lord Chancellor Hatherly, the law was twice
      altered in Parliament. Before victory was ultimately obtained I had to
      carry the case into the Court of Error, and I prepared and sent out at my
      own cost more than two hundred petitions to Parliament. Ultimately the
      Evidence Amendment Act, 1869, and the Evidence Further Amendment Act,
      1870, gave Freethinkers the right to enter the witness box, and I won my
      suit. The Christian defendant finished by becoming bankrupt, and I lost a
      terribly large sum in debt and costs. The original debt and interest were
      over £300, and the costs of the various proceedings were very heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the winter of 1870 the Mirfield Town Hall, which had been properly
      taken and paid for for two nights' lectures, was refused by the
      proprietors, who barricaded the hall, and obtained a great force of police
      from the neighborhood. In order that the law might be clearly settled on
      this matter, I brought an action to try the question, and although the
      late Mr. Justice Willis expressed himself strongly in my favor, it was
      held by Mr. Justice Mellor at <i>nisi prius</i> that nothing, except a
      deed under seal or an actual demise, would avail. A mere agreement for a
      user of a hall was a license revocable at will, even when for a valuable
      consideration. This convinced me that when hall proprietors break their
      contracts, I must enforce my rights as I did at Huddersfield, and have
      done in other places.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the Franco-Prussian struggle I remained neutral until the 4th of
      September. I was against Bismark and his blood-and-iron theory, but I was
      also against the Empire and the Emperor; so I took no part with either. I
      was lecturing at Plymouth the day the <i>decheance</i> was proclaimed, and
      immediately after wrote my first article in favor of Republican France. I
      now set to work and organized a series of meetings in London and the
      provinces, some of which were cooperated in by Dr. Congreve, Professor
      Beesly, and other prominent members of the Positivist party. These
      meetings exercised some little effect on the public opinion in this
      country, but unfortunately the collapse on the part of France was so
      complete, and the resources commanded by Bismark and Moltke so vast, that,
      except as expressing sympathy, the results were barren. In October, 1870,
      I, without any previous communication from myself to them, received from
      the Republican Government at Tours a long and flattering letter, signed by
      Leon Gambetta, Adolphe Cremieux, Al Glais Bizoin, and Admiral Fourichon,
      declaring that they, as members of the "Gouvernement de la Defense
      Nationale, reunis en delegation a Tours," "tiennent a honneur de vous
      remercier chalereusement du noble concours que vous apportez a la cause de
      la France." On the 2d of February, 1871, M. Tissot, the Charge d'Affaires
      of France in England, wrote me: "Quant a moi, mon cher ami, le ne puis que
      constater ici, comme je l'ai deja fait, comme je le feraien toute
      occasion, la dette que nous avons contracted envers vous. Vous nous avez
      donne votre temps, votre activite, votre eloquence, votre ame, la
      meilleure partie de vous meme, en un mot; la France que vous avez ete
      seule a defendre ne l'oubliera jamais." This is probably a too flattering
      estimate of my services to France, but coming from the official
      representative of the French Republic, I feel entitled to insert it. In
      September, 1871, Monsieur Emmanuel Arago, member of the Provisional
      Government of the 4th of September, wrote the following words upon the
      letter which had been sent me, as above mentioned, in October, 1870, by
      the Delegate Government of Tours: "En lisant cette lettre, j'eprouve tres
      vivement le regret de n'avoir pu, en-ferme dans Paris, joindre ma
      signature a celles de mes collegues de la delegation de Tours. Mr.
      Bradlaugh est et sera toujours dans la Republique notre concitoyen."

      During 1870, 1871, and 1872, 1 held several debates with the Rev. A. J.
      Harrison, formerly of Huddersfield. The first at Newcastle, in the
      splendid Town Hall of that place, was attended by about 5,000 persons. The
      second debate at Bristol, was notable from being presided over by
      Professor Newman. The third discussion was at Birmingham, and was an
      attempt at the Socratic method, and the last platform encounter, was in
      the New Hall of Science, London. Of the Rev. Mr. Harrison it is enough I
      should say that, a few weeks since, when rumor put my life in danger, he
      was one of the first to write a kindly and unaffected letter of sympathy
      to Mrs. Bradlaugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the great cry of thanksgiving was raised for the recovery of the
      Prince of Wales, I could not let it pass without protest. While he lay
      dangerously ill I had ceased to make any attack on himself or family, but
      I made no pretense of a grief I did not feel. When the thanksgiving day
      was fixed, and tickets for St. Paul's were sent by the Lord Chamberlain to
      working men representatives, I felt it right to hold a meeting of protest,
      which was attended by a crowded audience in the New Hall of Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "right of meeting" has given me three important occasions of measuring
      swords with the Government during the last few years, and each time defeat
      has attended the Government. The first, the Hyde Park meeting, where I
      acted in accord with Mr. Beales, to whom as chief, let the honor go of
      this conflict. The second was on the 31st July, 1871, under the following
      circumstances. A meeting had been held by Mr. G. Odger and some of his
      friends in Hyde Park, on Sunday the 30th of July, to protest against the
      grant to Prince Arthur; this meeting was adjourned until the following
      evening. Late on the Sunday afternoon, the adjourned meeting was forbidden
      by the Government. Early on Monday morning Mr. Odger applied to me to give
      the friends the benefit of my legal knowledge and personal influence. I
      consented, and the Government persevering, I took my share of the
      responsibility of the gathering, and signed with Mr. Odger a new notice
      convening the meeting. The Home Office not only served us also with a
      written prohibition, but threatened and prepared to use force. I
      immediately gave Mr. Bruce notice that the force would be illegal, and
      that it would be resisted. At the last moment, and in fact only some half
      hour before the meeting commenced, the Government abandoned its
      prohibition, and an enormous meeting of a most orderly character was held
      in absolute defiance of the authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more recent case was in December, 1872, when finding that Mr. Odger,
      Mr. Bailey, and others, had been prosecuted under some monstrous and
      ridiculous regulations invented by Mr. Ayrton, I, on my own
      responsibility, determined to throw down the gauntlet to the Government. I
      did this most successfully, and soon after the opening of Parliament the
      obnoxious regulations were annulled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is at present too early to speak of the Republican movement in England,
      which I have sought, and not entirely without success, to organize on a
      thoroughly legal basis. It is a fair matter for observation that my
      lectures on "The Impeachment of the House of Brunswick," have been
      delivered to crowded audiences assembled in some of the finest halls in
      England and Scotland, notably the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, the Town
      Hall, Birmingham, the Town Hall, Northampton, and the City Hall, Glasgow.
      It is, as far as I am aware, the first time any English citizen has,
      without tumult or disorder and in buildings belonging to various
      Municipalities, directly challenged the hereditary right of the reigning
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      In penning the foregoing sketch I had purposely to omit many facts
      connected with branches of Italian, Irish, and French politics. I have
      also entirely omitted my own struggles for existence. The political parts
      are left out because there are secrets which are not my own alone, and
      which may not bear full telling for many years to come. The second,
      because I hope that another year or two of hard work may enable me to free
      myself from the debt load which for some time has hung heavily round me.

      A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE DEVIL
    </h2>
    <p>
      To have written under this head in the reign of James Rex, of pious
      memory, would have, probably, procured for me, without even the perusal of
      my pamphlet, the reputation of Dr. Faustus, and a too intimate
      acquaintance with some of the pleasant plans of torturing to death
      practiced by the clever witch-finders of that day. I profess, however, no
      knowledge of the black art, and am entirely unskilled in <i>diablerie</i>,
      and feel quite convinced that the few words I shall say about his Satanic
      Majesty will not be cause of any unholy compacts in which bodies or souls
      are signed away in ink suspiciously red.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many countries, dealing with the Devil has been a perilous experiment.
      In 1790, an unfortunate named Andre Dubuisson was confined in the Bastile,
      charged with raising the Devil. To prevent even the slightest apprehension
      on the part of my reader that I have any desire or intent toward placing
      him unpleasantly near a black-visaged, sulphureous-constitutioned
      individual, horned like an old goat, with satyr-like legs, a tail of
      unpleasant length, and a disposition to buy a body from any unfortunate
      wight ready to dispose of it, I have only to assert my intention of
      treating the subject entirely from a biblical point of view. Doubtless I
      ought to do this; the Christian Devil is a bible institution. I say, \
      advisedly, the Christian Devil, because other religions have boasted their
      Devil, and it is well to prevent confusion. But I frankly admit that none
      of these religions have the honor of a Devil so devilish as our own.
      Indeed our Devil ought to be the best: it costs the most. No other
      religion besides our own can boast the array of Popes, Bishops,
      Conferences, Rectors, Incumbents, and paid preachers of various titles.
      And all these to preach against the Devil!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is necessary, before entering upon my subject, that I should confess my
      little ability to do it justice. I am unable to say, certainly, whether I
      am writing about a singular Devil or a plurality of Devils. In one text
      "Devils" are mentioned,* recognizing a plurality; in another, "the
      Devil,"** as if there was but one. We may, however, fairly assume that
      either there is one Devil, more than one, or less than one; and, having
      thus cleared our path from mere numerical difficulties, we will proceed to
      give the Devil his due. Satan appears either to have been a child of God,
      or, at any rate, a most intimate acquaintance of the family; for we find
      that on "a day when the children of God came to present themselves before
      the Lord, that Satan came also among them;"*** and no surprise or
      disapprobation is manifested at his presence. The conversation narrated in
      the Book of Job as occurring between God and the Devil has, for us, a
      value proportioned to the rarity of the scene, and to the high character
      of the personages concerned.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Leviticus xvii, 7.

     ** Luke iv, 2.

     *** Job i, 6
</pre>
    <p>
      We are, therefore, despite the infidel criticism of Martin Luther, who
      condemns the Book of Job as "a sheer <i>argumentum fabulæ</i>" determined
      to examine carefully the whole particulars for ourselves; and, in so
      doing, we are naturally surprised to find God, the omniscient, putting to
      Satan the query, Whence comest thou? We cannot suppose God, the all-wise,
      ignorant upon the subject, and we can not avoid a feeling of astonishment
      that such an interrogatory should have been made. Satan's reply, assuming
      its correctness&mdash;and this the text leaves us no reason to doubt&mdash;increases
      our surprise and augments our astonishment. The answer given is, "From
      going to and fro in the earth, and from going up and down it," In
      remarking on this answer, I do not address myself to those wretched
      persons who, relying on their reason and common sense, ignore the divine
      truth. I address myself to the true believer, and I ask, is he not
      astonished to find, from his bible, that Satan could have gone to and fro
      in the earth, and walked up and down, and yet not have met God, the
      omnipresent, occasionally during his journeying? The Lord makes no comment
      on Satan's reply, but says, "Hast thou not considered my servant Job, that
      there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one
      that feareth God and escheweth evil?" It is rather extraordinary that God
      should wish to have the Devil's opinion on the only good man recorded as
      then living in the world: the more extraordinary when we know that God is
      all-wise, and knew Satan's opinion without asking it, and that God is
      immutable, and, therefore, would not be influenced by the expression of
      the Devil's opinion when uttered. Satan's answer is, "Doth Job fear God
      for naught? Hast thou not made an hedge about him, and about all that he
      hath on every side? Thou hast blest the work of his hand, and his
      substance is increased in the land; but put forth thine hand now and touch
      all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face." What is God's reply
      to this audacious assertion? Does he express his determination to protect
      the righteous Job? Does he use his power to rebuke the evil tempter? No.
      "The Lord said unto Satan, Behold all that he hath is in thy power; only
      upon himself put forth not thine hand." And this was Job's reward for
      being a perfect and upright man, one that feared God and eschewed evil. He
      was not sent to the Devil, but the Devil was sent to all that he had. And
      he lost all without repining&mdash;sons, daughters, oxen, asses, camels
      and sheep, all destroyed, and yet Job sinned not. Some divines have urged
      that we here get a beautiful picture of patience and contentment under
      wrong and misfortune. But I reply that it is not good to submit patiently
      to wrong, or to rest contented under misfortune. I urge that it is manlier
      far to resist wrong, nobler far to wage war against wrong, better far to
      carefully investigate the causes of wrong and misfortune, with a view to
      their removal. Contentment under wrong is a crime, voluntary submission
      under oppression is not the virtue some would have it to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves
      before the Lord [as if God's children could ever be absent from him], and
      Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord. And the
      Lord said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the Lord
      and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down
      in it. And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job,
      that there is none like him in the earth? a perfect and an upright man,
      one that feareth God and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his
      integrity, although thou movedst me against HIM TO DESTROY HIM WITHOUT
      CAUSE."
    </p>
    <p>
      Can God be moved against a man to destroy him without a cause? If so, God
      is neither immutable nor all-wise. Yet the bible puts into God's mouth the
      terrible admission that the Devil had moved God against Job to destroy him
      without cause. If true, it destroys God's goodness; if false, then the
      bible is no revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Satan answered the Lord and said, "Skin for skin, yea, all that a man
      hath will he give for his life; put forth thine hand now and touch his
      bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face."
    </p>
    <p>
      Does the Lord now drive the Devil from his presence? Is there any
      expression of wrath or indignation against his tempter? Not so. "The Lord
      said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand, but save his life." And Job,
      being better than everybody else, finds himself smitten in consequence
      with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. The ways of the
      Lord are not as our ways, or this would seem the reverse of an
      encouragement to virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      We turn over the pages of our bible for further information on this
      diabolic theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      After reading the account of the numbering by David attentively, one is
      puzzled by the apparent contradiction, that in one place "God" and in
      another "Satan" occurs.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * 1 Chron. xxi, 1; 2 Sam. xxiv, 1
</pre>
    <p>
      But it may be that there is more harmony between God and the Devil than
      ordinary men are aware. Unfortunately, we have not the advantage of great
      scholarship, but one erudite commentator on the bible tells us, in
      speaking of the Hebrew word Azazel: "This terrible and venerable name of
      God, through the pens of biblical glossers, has been <i>a Devil, a
      mountain</i>, a wilderness, and a he-goat."* Well may incomprehensibility
      be an attribute of Deity, when, even to holy and reverend fathers, God has
      been sometimes undistinguishable from a he-goat or a Devil. Goats and
      Devils are alike represented with horns and tails. We trust that profanity
      will not enlarge on this sad confusion of ideas. Not possessing great
      lingual acquirements, we adhere to the English bible, believing that
      religion can never be improved by mere common sense, or human effort. We
      admire, without understanding, the skill of the Missionary, who makes the
      word "Mooigniazimoongo" an equivalent for God in the Sooahelee dialect,
      and who represents "original sin" to the Ottomi Indian by the word
      "Teacatzintiliztlatlacolli," and who recommends the Delaware to repentance
      as "Schiwelendamowitchewagan."
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not wonder that in these translating thaumaturgic exploits God and
      Devil get mistaken for each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      God is a spirit. Jesus was led up of the Spirit to be tempted of the
      Devil; and it is also true that spirits are very likely to lead men to the
      Devil. Too intimate acquaintance with whisky toddy overnight is often
      followed by the <i>delirium tremens</i> and blue-devils on the morrow. We
      advise our readers to eschew alike spirituous and spiritual mixtures. They
      interfere sadly with sober thinking, and play the Devil with your brains.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of the temptation of Jesus by the Devil has been dealt with in
      another essay.** Yet it may be well to add the opinion of a Church of
      England divine in this place: "That the Devil should appear personally <i>to</i>
      the Son of God <i>is certainly not more wonderful</i> than that he should,
      in a more remote age, have appeared <i>among</i> the sons of God, in the
      presence of God himself, to tempt and torment the righteous Job."

      But that Satan should carry Jesus, bodily and literally, through the air&mdash;first
      to the top of a high mountain, and then to the topmost pinnacle of the
      temple&mdash;is wholly inadmissible, it is an insult to our
      understanding.* It is pleasant to be able to find so many clergymen, in
      these days, zealously repudiating their own creeds. I am not prepared to
      speak strongly as to the color of the Devil; white men paint him black,
      black men white; but, allowing for the prejudices of dark-colored and
      fair-skinned believers, an invisible green would not be an unreasonable
      tint. We presume that he is not colorless, as otherwise the Evangelists or
      the persons present would have labored under considerable difficulties in
      witnessing the casting out of the Devil from the man in the synagogue.**
      This Devil is described as an unclean Devil, and it is, therefore, a fair
      inference that there are some clean Devils as well as dirty Devils.
      Printer's Devils are mostly unclean Devils, but then they are only little
      Devils, and we must not make too much of them. Nearly all the Devils seem
      to talk, and it has therefore been conjectured by some bachelor
      metaphysicians that they are of the feminine gender, but I see no reason
      to agree in this, and my wife is of a contrary opinion. The Devils are
      probably good Christians&mdash;one text tells us that they believe and
      tremble. It is a fact with some poor Devils that the more they believe the
      more they tremble. We are told in another text that the Devil goeth about
      like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. He will have extremely
      bad taste, however, if he eat up the lean and bony working-classes, while
      so many fat bishops and stout archdeacons remain unconsumed.

      Devils should be a sort of eternal salamander, for we are told there is
      everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his angels,* and that there is
      a lake of brimstone and fire, into which the Devil was cast.** Perhaps
      instead of being salamander they will, while in the fire, be rather of the
      'otter tribe; but this is a question which Mr. C. H. Spurgeon, who is a
      far better judge of brimstone than myself, would be more competent to
      settle. The Devil has, at least upon one occasion, figured as a
      controversialist. He disputed with the archangel Michael, contending about
      the body of Moses;*** and in these degenerate days of personality in
      debate it is pleasant to know that the religious champion, unlike the
      Grants, Coopers, and Brindleys of the present period, was very civil
      toward his Satanic opponent. The Devil was once imprisoned for 1,000 years
      in a bottomless pit.**** If a pit has no bottom, it seems but little
      confinement to shut the top; but with faith and prayer, even a good
      foundation may be obtained for a bottomless pit.

      It is urged by some that the Devil was the serpent of Genesis&mdash;that
      is, that it was really Satan who, in this guise, tempted Eve. There is

      interview with Eve the serpent seems to have confined himself to the
      strict truth.****** There is, in fact, no point of resemblance&mdash;no
      horns, no hoof, nothing except the tail&mdash;which can be in any way

      The Old Testament speaks a little of the Devils, sometimes of Satan, but
      never of "The Devil," and it seems almost too much, in Matthew, to usher
      him in, in the temptation scene, without introduction, and as if he were
      an old acquaintance. I do not remember reading, in the Old Testament,
      anything about the lake of brimstone and fire; this feature of faith was
      reserved for the warmth of Christian love to inspire; the Pentateuch makes
      no reference to it. Zechariah, in a vision, saw "Joshua, the High-Priest,
      standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right
      hand to resist him."* Why the Devil wanted to resist Joshua is not clear;
      but as Joshua's garments were in a very filthy state, it may be that he
      was preaching to the Priest the virtues of cleanliness. It is often said
      that cleanliness is next to godliness; I honestly confess that I should
      prefer a clean sinner to a dirty saint. Jesus said that one of the twelve
      disciples was a Devil,** but I am not prepared to say whether he meant the
      unfaithful and cowardly Peter, to whom he intrusted the keys of Heaven, or
      Judas who sold him for money, just as would nearly any bishop of the
      present day. The bishops preach that it is as difficult for a rich man to
      get into Heaven as for a camel to go through the eye of a needle; yet they
      enrich themselves, and their families, as greedily and carelessly as if
      they, at any rate, never expected to smell brimstone as a consequence. You
      are told to resist the Devil, and he will flee from you;*** if this be
      true, he is a cowardly Devil, and thus does not agree quite with Milton's
      picture of his grand, defiant, almost heroism. But then Milton was a poet,
      and true religion has but little poetry in it.

      Jeroboam, one of the Jewish monarchs, ordained priests for the Devils,*

      clergy are gentlemen in black. In the time of Jesus, Satan must, when not
      in the body of some mad, deaf, dumb, blind, or paralytic person, have been
      in Heaven; for Jesus, on one occasion, told his disciples that he saw
      Satan, as lightning, fall from Heaven.** Of course, this would betoken a
      rapid descent, but although a light affair, it is no laughing matter, and
      we reverently leave it to the clergy to explain the text. Jesus told Simon
      Peter that Satan desired to have him, that he might sift him as wheat;***
      in this text it may be urged that Jesus was chaffing his disciple. Paul,
      the apostle, seems to have looked on the Devil much as the magistrates of
      Guernsey, Devonport, and Yarmouth look on the police, for Paul delivered
      Hymeneus and Alexander unto Satan, that they may learn not to
      blaspheme.****

      In the present year the vulgar tirades of Reginald Radcliffe, Richard
      Weaver, and C. H. Spurgeon (some of them delivered in Exeter Hall) will
      serve to evidence that the above quotation is not the exaggeration which
      some might think. In London, before crowded audiences, Mr. Weaver, without
      originality, and with only the merit of copied coarseness, has called upon
      the Lord to "shake the ungodly for five minutes over the mouth of Hell."
      Mr. Spurgeon has drawn pictures of Hell which, if true and revealed to him
      by God, are most disgustingly frightful, and which being, as we believe,
      false, and but the creation of his own vulgar, morbid fancies, induce, on
      our part, a feeling of contempt as well as disgust.

      The Wesleyans, some years since, made the Devil a prominent feature in the
      famous "Fly-Sheet" controversy, so much so that a Wesleyan, speaking and
      writing on the subject, suggested that the authors of the "Fly-Sheets"
      were Devils, and another once-Wesleyan writer says: "The first thing which
      made me inquire about the Devil was that I thought him abused. I thought
      him bad enough, but could not help fearing that people told lies about
      him. R. S&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, a very zealous prayer-leader, stole some
      oats, and imputed the blame to the Devil. T. C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; got
      drunk, and complained in the love-feast that the Devil had been very busy
      with him for some time, and then took him in an unguarded moment. B. S&mdash;&mdash;-
      was detected in lying, and complained that Satan had gained the advantage
      over him. Old George White burned his fingers in lighting his pipe, and
      declared that it was the Devil that caused him to do it; and Farmer Duffy
      horsewhipped his wife, and said that he did it to beat the Devil out of
      her. This make me desirous to know what influence the Devil really had,
      and I was stimulated to this inquiry by my friend, Mr. Trelevan, who
      assured mo that the Devil was as necessary as the Almighty to the orthodox
      faith."* The fashionable preachers in the neighborhood of Belgravia mostly
      eschew the Devil, and avoid the taint of brimstone; treacle is the
      commodity they dispense.

      For myself, the only Devil I know is that black Devil ignorance, fostered
      by knavery and tyranny; a Devil personified by the credulous many, and
      kept up in the past by the learned but treacherous few, who preferred to
      rule the masses by their fears, rather than to guide them through their
      love. This devil has, indeed, not been a roaring lion, but a cowardly and
      treacherous boa constrictor; it has enveloped in its massive folds
      glorious truths, and in the fierceness of its brute power has crushed them
      in its writhings. But oh! a glorious day is coming: amid the heretofore
      gloom of night the bright rays of the rising sun are piercing, the light
      of truth dispels the mists of ignorance. Bright facts drive out dark
      delusions; mighty truths triumph over pious frauds, and no longer need men
      be affrighted by the notion of an omnipotent fiend, wandering through the
      earth, ever seeking their damnation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes&mdash;to partially adopt the phraseology of a writer in "Macmillan's
      Magazine"&mdash;I do refuse to see in God a being omniscient as
      omnipotent, who puts us into this world without our volition, leaves us to
      struggle through it as we can, unequally pitted against an almost
      omnipotent and supersubtile Devil, and then, if we fail, finally drops us
      out of this world into Hell-fire, where a legion of inferior Devils find
      constant and never-ending employment in inventing fresh tortures for us;
      our crime being that we have not succeeded where success was rendered
      impossible. No high, no manly, no humane thinkings are developed in the
      doctrine of Devils and damnation. If a potent faith, it degrades alike the
      teacher and the taught, by its abhorrent mercilessness; and if a form,
      instead of a faith, then is the Devil doctrine a misleading sham, which
      frightens weak minds and never developes strong men.

    <h2>
      NEW LIFE OF DAVID.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In compiling a biographical account of any ancient personage, impediments
      mostly arise from the uncertainty of the various traditions out of which
      we gather our biography, and from the party bias and coloring which often
      pervade and detract from their value. In the present case no such obstacle
      is met with, no such bias can be imagined, for, in giving the life of
      David, we extract it from an all-wise God's perfect and infallible
      revelation to man, and thus are enabled to present it to our readers free
      from any doubt, uncertainty, or difficulty. The father of David was Jesse,
      an Ephrathite of Bethlehem-judah. Jesse had either eight sons (1 Samuel
      xvi, 10, 11, and xvii, 12) or only seven (1 Chron. ii, 13 to 15), and
      David was either the eighth son or the seventh. Some may think this a
      difficulty to commence with, but such persons will only be those who rely
      on their own intellectual faculties, or who have been misled by Colenso's
      arithmetic. If you, my dear reader, are in any doubt, at once consult some
      qualified divine, and he will explain to you that there is really no
      difference between eight and seven when rightly understood with prayer and
      faith, by the help of the spirit. Arithmetic is an utterly infidel
      acquirement, and one which all true believers should eschew. In proof of
      this, I may observe that the proposition three times one are one is a
      fundamental article of the Christian faith. David's great grandmother was
      the holy harlot Rahab, and his grandmother was a lady who when unmarried
      went in the night and lay at the feet of Boaz, and left in the morning
      before it was light enough for any one to recognize her like her grandson
      she was "prudent in matters." When young, David tended his father's sheep,
      and apparently while so doing he obtained the reputation for being cunning
      in playing, a mighty valiant man, and a man of war and prudent in matters.
      He obtained his reputation as a soldier early and wonderfully, for he was
      "but a youth," and God's most holy word asserts that when going to fight
      with Goliath he tried to walk in armor, and could not, for he was not
      accustomed to it (1 Samuel xvii, 39, Douay version). Samuel shortly prior
      to this anointed David, and the spirit of the Lord came upon him from that
      day forward. If a man takes to spirits his life will probably be one of
      vice, misery, and misfortune, and if spirits take to him the result in the
      end is nearly the same. Saul being King of Israel, an evil spirit from the
      Lord troubled him. The devil has no ear for music, and Saul was
      recommended to have David to play on a harp in order that harmony might
      drive this evil spirit back to the Lord who sent it. The Jews' harp was
      played successfully, and Saul was often relieved from the evil spirit by
      the aid of David's ministrations. There is nothing miraculous in this; at
      the people's concerts many a working man has been released from the "blue
      devils" by a stirring chorus, a merry song, or patriotic anthem. David was
      appointed armor-bearer to the king, but curiously enough this office does
      not appear to have interfered with his duties as a shepherd; indeed the
      care of his father's sheep took precedence over the care of the king's
      armor, and in the time of war he "went and returned to feed his father's
      sheep." Perhaps his "prudence in matters" induced him thus to take care of
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Philistine, one Goliath of Gath (whose hight was six cubits and a span,
      or about nine feet six inches, at a low computation) had defied the armies
      of Israel. This Goliath was (to use the vocabulary of the reverend
      sporting correspondent of a certain religious newspaper) a veritable
      champion of the heavy weights. He carried in all two cwt. of armor,
      offensive and defensive, upon his person, and his challenge had great
      weight. None dared accept it among the soldiers of Saul until the arrival
      of David with some food for his brethren. David volunteered to fight the
      giant, but Saul objecting that he was not competent to take part in a
      conflict so dangerous, David related how he pursued a <i>lion and a bear</i>,
      how he caught <i>him</i> by his beard and slew <i>him</i>. David's offer
      was accepted, he was permitted to fight the giant. In one verse David slew
      the Philistine with a stone, in another verse he slew him with the giant's
      own sword, while in 2 Samuel, c. xxi, v. 19, we are told that Goliath the
      Gittite was slain by Elhanan. Our transalators, who have great regard for
      our faiths and more for their pulpits, have kindly inserted the words "the
      brother of" before Goliath. This saves the true believer from the
      difficulty of understanding how Goliath of Gath could have been killed by
      different men at different times. David was previously well known to Saul,
      and was much loved and favored by that monarch. He was also seen by the
      king before he went forth to do battle with the gigantic Philistine. Yet
      Saul had forgotten his own armor-bearer and much-loved harpist, and was
      obliged to ask Abner who David was. Abner, captain of the king's host,
      familiar with the person of the armor-bearer to the king, of course knew
      David well; he therefore answered, "As thy soul liveth, O king, I can not
      tell." One day the evil spirit from the Lord came upon Saul and he
      prophesied. Men who are spiritually inclined often talk great nonsense
      under the influence of spirits, which they sometimes regret when sober. It
      is, however, an interesting fact in ancient spiritualism to know that Saul
      prophesied with a devil in him. Under the joint influence of the devil and
      prophecy, he tried to kill David, and when this was repeated, even after
      David had married the king's daughter (for whose wedding trousseau he had
      procured an interesting and delicate offering by the slaughter of two
      hundred men), then to save his own life David fled to Naioth, and Saul
      sent there messengers to arrest him, but the king's messengers having all
      become prophets, in the end Saul went himself, and this time the spirit of
      the Lord came upon him, and he stripped off his clothes and prophesied as
      hard as the rest. What he phrophesied about we do not know. In fact, the
      priests have made so great deduction from the profits during the plenitude
      of their power, that there has been little which is profitable in
      connection with religion left for the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      David lived in exile for some time, having collected around him every one
      that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that
      was discontented. Saul made several fruitless attempts to effect his
      capture, with no better result than that he twice placed himself in the
      power of David, who twice showed the mercy to a cruel king which he never
      conceded to an unoffending people. David having obtruded himself upon
      Achish, King of Gath, and doubtful of his safety, feigned madness to cover
      his retreat. He then lived a precarious life, sometimes levying a species
      of blackmail upon defenseless farmers. Having applied to one farmer to
      make him some compensation for permitting the farm to go unrobbed, and his
      demand not having been complied with, David, who is a man after the heart
      of the God of mercy, immediately determined to murder the farmer and all
      his household for their wicked reluctance in submitting to his extortions.
      The wife of farmer Nabal compromised the matter. David "accepted her
      person" and ten days afterward Nabal was found dead in his bed. David
      afterward went with six hundred men and lived under the protection of
      Achish, king of Gath; and while thus residing (being the anointed one of a
      God who says "Thou shalt not steal,") he robbed the inhabitants of the
      surrounding places; being also obedient to the statute "Thou 1 shalt do no
      murder," he slaughtered, and left neither man nor woman alive to report
      his robberies to King Achish; and as he "always walked in the ways" of a
      God to whom "lying lips are an abomination," he made false reports to
      Achish in relation to his actions. Of course this was all for the glory of
      God, whose ways are not as our ways. Soon the Philistines were engaged in
      another of the constantly recurring conflicts with the Israelites. Who
      offered them the help of himself and band? Who offered to make war on his
      own countrymen? David, the man after God's own heart, who obeyed his
      statutes and who walked in his ways to do only that which was right in the
      sight of God. The Philistines rejected the traitor's aid, and saved David
      from the consummation of this baseness. While David was making this
      unpatriotic proffer of his services to the Philistines, his own city of
      Ziglag was captured by the Amalekites, who were doubtless endeavoring to
      avenge some of the most unjustifiable robberies and murders perpetrated by
      David and his followers in their country. David's own friends evidently
      thought that this misfortune was a retribution for David's crimes, for
      they spoke of stoning him. The Amalekites had captured and carried off
      every thing, but they do not seem to have maltreated or killed any of
      their enemies. David was less merciful. He pursued them, recaptured the
      spoil, and spared not a man of them, save 400 who escaped on camels. In
      consequence of the death of Saul, David soon after was elevated to the
      throne of Judah, while Ishbosheth, son of Saul, was made King of Israel.
      But Ishbosheth, having been assassinated, David slew the assassins, when
      they, hoping for reward, brought him the news, and he reigned ultimately
      over Israel also.
    </p>
    <p>
      As my religious readers are doubtless aware, the Lord God of Israel, after
      the time of Moses, usually dwelt on the top of an ark or box, between two
      figures of gold, and on one occasion David made a journey with his
      followers to Baal, to bring thence the ark of God. They placed it on a new
      cart drawn by oxen. On their journey the oxen stumbled and consequently
      shook the cart, and one of the drivers, whose name was Uzzah, fearing that
      God might be tumbled to the ground, took hold of the ark, apparently in
      order to steady it, and prevent it from overturning. God, who is a God of
      love, was much displeased that any one should presume to do any such act
      of kindness, and killed Uzzah on the spot as a punishment for his error.
      This shows that if a man sees the Church of God tumbling down, he should
      never try to prop it up; if it be not strong enough to save itself the
      sooner it falls the better for human kind&mdash;that is, if they keep away
      from it while it is falling. David was much displeased that the Lord had
      killed Uzzah; in fact, David seems to have wished for a monopoly of
      slaughter, and always manifested displeasure when killing was done
      unauthorized by himself. Being displeased, David would not take the ark to
      Jerusalem; he left it in the house of Obed Edom, but as the Lord proved
      more kind to Obed Edom than he had done to Uzzah, David determined to
      bring it away, and he did so, and David danced before the ark in a state
      of semi-nudity, for which he was reproached by Michal. The story is one
      which, by itself, would be as entertaining to a depraved mind as any
      Holywell-Street pamphlet, if Lord Campbell's act did not prevent the
      publication of indecencies. The pages of God's most holy word, we believe,
      do not come within the scope of the act, and lovers of obscene language
      may therefore have legal gratification so long as the bible shall exist.
      The God of Israel, who had been leading a wandering life for many years,
      and who had "walked in a tent and in a tabernacle," and "from tent to
      tent," and "from one tabernacle to another," and who "had not dwelt in any
      house" since the time that he brought the Isrealites out of Egypt, was
      offered "an house for him to dwell in," but he declined to accept it
      during the lifetime of David, although he promised to permit the son of
      David to erect him such an abode. David being now a powerful monarch, and
      having many wives and concubines, saw one day the beautiful wife of one of
      his soldiers. To see, with this licentious monarch, was to crave for the
      gratification of his lust. The husband, Uriah, was fighting for the king,
      yet David was base enough to steal his wife's virtue during Uriah's
      absence in the field of battle. "Thou shalt not commit adultery," was one
      of the commandments, yet we are told by God of this David, "who kept my
      commandments, and who followed me with all his heart to do only that which
      was right in mine eyes" (1 Kings, c. xiv, v. 8). David having seduced the
      wife, sent for her husband, wishing to make him condone his wife's
      dishonor, as many a man has done in other lands, when a king or prince has
      been the seducer. Some hold that virtue in rags is less worth than vice
      when coroneted. Uriah would not be thus tricked, and David, the pious
      David, coolly planned, and without mercy caused to be executed, the
      treacherous murder of Uriah. God is all just; and David having committed
      adultery and murder, God punished and killed an innocent child, which had
      no part or share in David's crime, and never chose that it should be born
      from the womb of Bathsheba. After this the king David was even more cruel
      and merciless than before. Previously he had systematically slaughtered
      the inhabitants of Moab, now he sawed people with saws, cut them with
      harrows and axes, and made them pass through brick-kilns. Yet of this man
      God said he "did that which was right in mine eyes." So bad a king, so
      treacherous a man, a lover so inconstant, a husband so adulterous, of
      course was a bad father, having bad children. We are little surprised,
      therefore, to read that his son Ammon robbed his sister, David's daughter
      Tamar, of her virtue; and that Ammon was afterward slain by his own
      brother, David's son Absalom, and are scarcely astonished that Absalom
      himself, on the house-top, in the sight of all Israel, should complete his
      father's shame by an act worthy a child of God's selected people. Yet
      these are God's chosen race, and this is the family of the man "who walked
      in God's ways all the days of his life."
    </p>
    <p>
      God, who is all-wise and all-just, and who is not a man that he should
      repent, had repented that he, had made Saul king because Saul spared one
      man. In the reign of David the same good God sent a famine for three years
      on the decendants of Abraham, and upon being asked his reason for thus
      starving his chosen ones, the reply of the Deity was that he sent the
      famine on the subjects of David because Saul slew the Gibeonites.
      Satisfactory reason!&mdash;because Oliver Cromwell slew the Royalists, God
      will punish the subjects of Charles the Second. One reason is to profane
      eyes equivalent to the other, but a bishop or even a rural dean would show
      how remarkably God's justice was manifested. David was not behindhand in
      justice. He had sworn to Saul that he would not cut off his seed&mdash;i.e.
      that he would not destroy Saul's family. He therefore took two of Saul's
      sons, and five of Saul's grandsons, and gave them up to the Gibeonites,
      who hung them. Strangely wonderful are the ways of the Lord! Saul slew the
      Gibeonites, therefore years afterward God starves Judah. The Gibeonites
      hang men who had nothing to do with the crime of Saul, except that they
      are his decendants, and then we are told "the Lord was intreated for the
      land." Perhaps David wanted to get rid of the royal family of Saul. The
      anger of the Lord being kindled against Israel, and he wanting some excuse
      for punishing the decendants of Jacob, moved David to number his people.
      The Chronicles say that it was Satan, and pious people may thus learn that
      there is little difference between God and the Devil when rightly
      understood. Both are personifications founded in the ignorance of the
      masses, and their continuance will cease with their credulousness. David
      caused a census to be taken of the tribes of Israel and Judah. There is a
      trivial disagreement to the extent of about 270,000 soldiers between
      Samuel and Chronicles, but the readers must not allow so slight an
      inaccuracy as this to stand between them and heaven. What are 270,000 men
      when looked at prayerfully? The idea that any doubt should arise is to a
      devout mind at the same time profane and preposterous. Infidels suggest
      that 1,570,000 soldiers form a larger army than the Jews are likely to
      have possessed. I can only add that as God is omnipotent, there is no
      reason to limit his power of increasing or decreasing miraculously the
      armament of the Jewish nation. David, it seems, did wrong in numbering his
      people, although we are never told that he did wrong in robbing or
      murdering their neighbors, or in pillaging peaceful agriculturists. David
      said, "I have sinned." The king having done wrong, an all-merciful God
      brought a pestilence on the people, and murdered 70,000 Israelites for an
      offense which their ruler had committed. The angel who was engaged in this
      terrible slaughter stood somewhere between heaven and earth, and stretched
      forth his hand with a drawn sword in it to destroy Jerusalem itself, but
      even the blood-thirsty Deity of the bible "repented him of the evil," and
      said to the angel, "It is enough." Many volumes might be written to answer
      the inquiries&mdash;Where did the angel stand, and on what? Of what metal
      was the sword, and where was it made? As it was a drawn one, where was the
      scabbard? and did the angel wear a sword belt? Examined in a pious frame
      of mind, much holy instruction may be derived from the attempt at solution
      of these problems.
    </p>

      David now grows old and weak, and at last, notwithstanding that he has the
      advantage of a pretty maiden to cherish him, he wears out, and his death
      hour comes. Oh! for the dying words of the Psalmist! What pious
      instruction shall we derive from the deathbed scene of the man after God's
      own heart! Listen to the last words of Judah's expiring monarch. You who
      have been content with the pious frauds and forgeries perpetrated with
      reference to the deathbeds and dying words of the great, the generous, the
      witty Voltaire, the manly, the self-denying, the incorruptible Thomas
      Paine, the humane, simple, child-like man, yet mighty poet, Shelley&mdash;you
      who have turned away from these with horror, unfounded if real, come with
      me to the death couch of the special favorite of God. Bathsheba's child
      stands by his side. Does any thought of the murdered Uriah rack old
      David's brain, or has a tardy repentance effaced the bloody stain from the
      pages of his memory? What does the dying David say? Does he talk of
      cherubs, angels, and heavenly choirs? Nay, none of these things pass his
      lips. Does he make a confession of his crime-stained life, and beg his son
      to be a better king, a truer man, a more honest citizen, a wiser father?
      Nay, not so&mdash;no word or sigh of regret, no expression of remorse or
      repentance escaped his lips. What does the dying David say? This foul
      adulterer, whom God has made king; this red-handed robber, whose life has
      been guarded by "our Father which art in Heaven;" this perjured king,
      whose lying lips have found favor in the sight of God, and who when he
      dies is safe for Heaven. Does David repent? Nay&mdash;like the ravenous
      tiger or wolf, which once tasting blood is made more eager for the prey,
      he yearns for blood; he dies, and with his dying breath begs his son to
      bring the grey hairs of two old men down to the grave with blood. Yet this
      is the life of God's anointed king, the chief one of God's chosen people.
    </p>
    <p>
      David is alleged to have written several Psalms. In one of these he
      addresses God in the phraseology of a member of the P. R. praising Deity
      that he had smitten all of his enemies on the cheek bone and broken the
      teeth of the ungodly. In these days, when "muscular Christianity" is not
      without advocates, the metaphor which presents God as a sort of
      magnificent Benicia Boy may find many admirers. In the eighteenth Psalm,
      David describes God as with "smoke coming out of his nostrils and fire out
      of his mouth," by which "coals were kindled." He represents God as coming
      down from heaven, and says "he rode upon a cherub." The learned Parkhurst
      gives a likeness of a one-legged, four-winged, four-faced animal, part
      lion, part bull, part eagle, part man, and if a cloven foot be any
      criterion, part devil also. This description, if correct, will give some
      idea to the faithful of the wonderful character of the equestrian feats of
      Deity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the twenty-sixth Psalm, the writer, if David, exposes his own hypocrisy
      in addition to his other vices. He has the impudence to tell God that he
      has been a man of integrity and truth; that he has avoided evildoers,
      although if we are to believe the thirty-eighth Psalm, the vile hypocrite
      must have already been subject to a loathsome disease&mdash;a penalty
      consequent on his licentiousness and criminality. In another Psalm, David
      the liar tells God that "he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my
      sight." To understand his malevolent nature we can not do better than
      quote his prayer to God against an enemy (Psalm cix, 6-14):
    </p>
    <p>
      "6. Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "7. When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer
      become sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "8. Let his days be few: and let another take his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      "9. Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "10. Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek
      their bread also out of their desolate places.
    </p>
    <p>
      "11. Let the extortioner catch all that he hath: and let the strangers
      spoil his labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "12. Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any
      to favor his fatherless children.
    </p>
    <p>
      "13. Let his posterity be cut off: and in the generation following let
      their name be blotted out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "14. Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the Lord: and let
      not the sin of his mother be blotted out."
    </p>
    <p>
      A full consideration of the life of David must give great help to each
      orthodox reader in promoting and sustaining his faith. While he is spoken
      of by Deity as obeying all the statutes and keeping all the commandments,
      we are astonished to find that murder, theft, lying, adultery,
      licentiousness, and treachery are among the crimes which may be laid to
      his charge. David was a liar, God is a God of truth; David was merciless,
      God is merciful, and of long suffering; David was a thief, God says "Thou
      shalt not steal;" David was a murderer, God says "Thou shalt do no
      murder;" David took the wife of Uriah, and "accepted" the wife of Nabal,
      God says "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife;" Yet, notwithstanding
      all these things, David was a man after God's own heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had this Jewish monarch any redeeming traits in his character? Was he a
      good citizen? If so, the bible has carefully concealed every action which
      would entitle him to such an appellation, and in lieu has given us the
      record of his attempted extortion in the case of Nabal, and furnished us
      with a notice of his horde of followers&mdash;outlawed, discontented, and
      in debt. Was he a kind and constant husband? Was he grateful to those who
      aided him in his hour of need? Nay; like the wounded serpent which, half
      frozen by the wayside, is warmed into new life in the traveler's breast,
      and then treacherously stabs him with his poisoned fangs, so David robbed
      and murdered the friends and allies of the King of Gath, who had afforded
      him refuge against the pursuit of Saul. Does his patriotism outshine his
      many vices? Does his love of country efface his many misdoings? Not even
      this. David was a heartless traitor who volunteered to serve against his
      own countrymen, and would have done so had not the Philistines rejected
      his treacherous help. Was he a good king? So say the priesthood now; but
      where is the evidence of his virtue? His crimes brought a plague and
      pestilence on his subjects, and his reign is a continued succession of
      wars, revolts, and assassinations, plottings and counterplots.
    </p>
    <p>
      The life of David is a dark blot on the page of human history, and our
      best hope is that if a spirit from God inspired the writer, then that it
      was a lying spirit, and that he has given us fiction instead of truth.

    <h2>
      NEW LIFE OF JACOB.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is pleasant work to present to the reader sketches of God's chosen
      people. More especially is it an agreeable task to recapitulate the
      interesting events occurring during the life of a man whom God has loved.
      Jacob was the son of Isaac; the grandson of Abraham. These three men were
      so free from fault, their lives so unobjectionable, that the God of the
      bible delighted to be called the "God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
      the God of Jacob." It is true, Abraham owned slaves, was not exact as to
      the truth, and, on one occasion, turned his wife and child out to the
      mercies of a sandy desert. That Isaac in some sort followed his father's
      example and disingenuous practices, and that Jacob was without manly
      feeling, a sordid, selfish, unfraternal cozener, a cowardly trickster, a
      cunning knave, but they must nevertheless have been good men, for God was
      "the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." The name
      Jacob is not inappropriate. Kalisch says: "This appellation, if taken in
      its obvious etymological meaning, implies a deep ignominy; for the root
      from which it is derived signifies <i>to deceive, to defraud,</i> and in
      such a despicable meaning the same form of the word is indeed used
      elsewhere (Jeremiah ix, 3). Jacob would, therefore, be nothing else but
      the crafty <i>impostor</i>; in this sense Esau, in the heat of his
      animosity, in fact clearly explains the word, justly is his name called
      Jacob (cheat) because he has cheated me twice" (Genesis xxvii, 30).
      According to the ordinary orthodox bible chronology, Jacob was born about
      1836 or 1837 B. C, that is, about 2,168 years from "in the beginning," his
      father Isaac being then sixty years of age. There is a difficulty
      connected with Holy Scripture chronology which would be insuperable were
      it not that we have the advantage of spiritual aids in elucidation of the
      text. This difficulty arises from the fact that the chronology of the
      bible, in this respect, like the major portion of bible history, is
      utterly unreliable. But we do not look to the Old or New Testament for
      mere commonplace, everyday facts; or if we do, severe will be the
      disappointment of the truthseeker; we look there for mysteries, miracles,
      paradoxes, and perplexities, and have no difficulties in finding the
      objects of our search. Jacob was born, together with his twin brother,
      Esau, in consequence of special entreaty addressed by Isaac to the Lord on
      behalf of Rebekah, to whom he had been married about nineteen years, and
      who was yet childless. Infidel physiologists (and it is a strange, though
      not unaccountable, fact that all who are physiologists are also in so far
      infidel) assert that prayer would do little to repair the consequence of
      such disease, or such abnormal organic structure, as would compel
      sterility. But our able clergy are agreed that the bible was not intended
      to teach us science; or, at any rate, we have learned that its attempts in
      that direction are most miserable failures. Its mission is to teach the
      unteachable; to enable us to comprehend the incomprehensible. Before Jacob
      was born God decreed that he and his descendants should obtain the mastery
      over Esau and his descendants&mdash;"the elder shall serve the younger."*
      The God of the bible is a just God, but it is hard for weak flesh to
      discover the justice of this proemial decree, which so sentenced to
      servitude the children of Esau before their father's birth.

     *Gen. xxv, 23.
</pre>
    <p>
      Jacob came into the world holding by his brother's heel, like some
      cowardly knave in the battle of life, who, not daring to break a gap in
      the hedge of conventional prejudice, which bars his path, is yet ready
      enough to follow some bolder warrior, and to gather the fruits of his
      courage. "And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the
      field: and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents." One day Esau
      returned from his hunting faint and wearied to the very point of death. He
      was hungry, and came to Jacob, his twin and only brother, saying, "Feed
      me, I pray thee,"* "for I am exceedingly faint."** In a like case would
      not any man so entreated immediately offer to the other the best at his
      command, the more especially when that other is his only brother, born at
      the same time, from the same womb, suckled at the same breast, fed under
      the same roof? But Jacob was not a man and a brother, he was one of God's
      chosen people, and one who had been honored by God's prenatal selection.
      "If a man come unto me and hate not his brother, he can not be my
      disciple." So taught Jesus the Jew, in after time, but in this earlier age
      Jacob the Jew, in practice, anticipated the later doctrine. It is one of
      the misfortunes of theology, if not its crime, that profession of love to
      God is often accompanied with bitter and active hate of man. Jacob was one
      of the founders of the Jewish race, and even in this their pre-historic
      age, the instinct for driving a hard bargain seems strongly developed.
      "Jacob said" to Esau, "Sell me this day thy birthright." The famished man
      vainly expostulated, and the birthright was sold for a mess of pottage.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Gen. xxv, 30

     **Douay version.
</pre>
    <p>
      If to-day one man should so meanly and cruelly take advantage of his
      brother's necessities to rob him of his birthright, all good and honest
      men would shun him as an unbrotherly scoundrel and most contemptible
      knave; yet, less than 4,000 years ago, a very different standard of
      morality must have prevailed. Indeed, if God is unchangeable, divine
      notions of honor and honesty must to-day be widely different from those of
      our highest men. God approved and endorsed Jacob's conduct. His approval
      is shown by his love afterward expressed for Jacob, his endorsement by his
      subsequent attention to Jacob's welfare. We may learn from this tale, so
      pregnant with instruction, that any deed which to the worldly and sensible
      man appears like knavery while understood literally, becomes to the devout
      and prayerful man an act of piety when understood spiritually. Much faith
      is required to thoroughly understand this; <i>for example</i>, it looks
      like swindling to collect poor children's halfpence and farthings in the
      Sunday schools for missionary purposes abroad, and to spend thereout two
      or three hundred pounds in an annual jubilatory dinner for well-fed pauper
      parsons at home; and so thought the noble lord who wrote to the <i>Times</i>
      under the initials S. G. O. If he had possessed more faith and less sense,
      he would have seen the piety and completely overlooked the knavery of the
      transaction. Pious preachers and clever commentators declare that Esau
      despised his birthright. I do not deny that they might back their
      declaration by scripture quotations, but I do deny that the narrative
      ought to convey any such impression. Esau's words were, "Behold I am at
      the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright be to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Isaac growing old, and fearing from his physical infirmities the near
      approach of death, was anxious to bless Esau before he died, and directed
      him to take quiver and bow and go out in the field to hunt some venison
      for a savory meat, such as old Isaac loved. Esau departed, but when he had
      left his father's presence in order to fulfill his request, Jacob appeared
      on the scene. Instigated by his mother, he, by an abject stratagem, passed
      himself off as Esau. With a savory meat prepared by Rebekah, he came into
      his father's presence, and Isaac said, "Who art thou, my son?" Lying lips
      are an abomination to the Lord. The Lord loved Jacob, yet Jacob lied to
      his old blind father, saying, "I am Esau, thy first-born." Isaac had some
      doubts: these are manifested by his inquiring how it was that the game was
      killed so quickly. Jacob, whom God loved, in a spirit of shameless
      blasphemy replied, "Because the Lord thy God brought it to me." Isaac
      still hesitated, fancying that he recognized the voice to be the voice of
      Jacob, and again questioned him, saying, "Art thou my very son Esau?" God
      is the God of truth and loved Jacob, yet Jacob said, "I am." Then Isaac
      blessed Jacob, believing that he was blessing Esau: and God permitted the
      fraud to be successful, and himself also blessed Jacob. In that
      extraordinary composition known as the Epistle to the Hebrews, we are told
      that by faith Isaac blessed Jacob. But what faith had Isaac? Faith that
      Jacob was Esau? His belief was produced by deceptive appearances. His
      faith resulted from false representations. And there are very many men in
      the world who have no better foundation for their religious faith than had
      Isaac when he blessed Jacob, believing him to be Esau. In the Douay bible
      I find the following note on this remarkable narrative: "St. Augustine (X.
      contra mendacium c. 10), treating at large upon this place, excuseth Jacob
      from a lie, because thi's whole passage was mysterious, as relating to the
      preference which was afterward to be given to the Gentiles before the
      carnal Jews, which Jacob, by prophetic light, might understand. So far it
      is certain that the first birthright, both by divine election and by
      Esau's free cession, belonged to Jacob; so that if there were any lie in
      the case, it would be no more than an officious and venial one." How
      glorious to be a pa triarch, and to have a real saint laboring years after
      your death to twist your lies into truth by aid of prophetic light. Lying
      is at all times most disreputable, but at the deathbed the crime is
      rendered more heinous. The death hour would have awed many men into
      speaking the truth, but it had little effect on Jacob. Although Isaac was
      about to die, this greedy knave cared not, so that he got from the dying
      man the sought-for prize. God is said to love righteousness and hate
      iniquity, yet he loved the iniquitous Jacob, and hated the honest Esau.
      All knaves are tinged more or less with cowardice. Jacob was no exception
      to the rule. His brother enraged at the deception practiced upon Isaac,
      threatened to kill Jacob. Jacob was warned by his mother and fled. Induced
      by Rebekah, Isaac charged Jacob to marry one of Laban's daughters. On the
      way to Haran, where Laban dwell, Jacob rested and slept. While sleeping he
      dreamed; ordinarily dreams have little significance, but in the bible they
      are more important. Some of the most weighty and vital facts (?) of the
      bible are communicated in dreams, and rightly so; if the men had been wide
      awake, they would have probably rejected the revelation as absurd. So much
      does that prince of darkness, the devil, influence mankind against the
      bible in the daytime, that it is when all is dark, and our eyes are
      closed, and the senses dormant, that God's mysteries are most clearly seen
      and understood. Jacob "saw in his sleep a ladder standing upon the earth,
      and the top thereof touching heaven; the angels of God ascending and
      descending by it, and <i>the Lord leaning upon the ladder</i>." In the
      ancient temples of India, and in the mysteries of Mithra, the
      seven-stepped ladder by which the spirits ascended to heaven is a
      prominent feature, and one of probably far higher antiquity than the age
      of Jacob. Did paganism furnish the groundwork for the patriarch's dream?
      "No man hath seen God at any time." God is "invisible." Yet Jacob saw the
      invisible God, whom no man hath seen or can see, either standing above a
      ladder or leaning upon it. True, it was all a dream. Yet God spoke to
      Jacob; but perhaps that was a delusion too. We find by scripture that God
      threatens to send to some "strong delusions, that they might believe a lie
      and be damned." Poor Jacob was much frightened, as any one might be, to
      dream of God leaning on so long a ladder. What if it had broken and the
      dreamer underneath it? Jacob's fears were not so powerful but that his
      shrewdness and avarice had full scope in a sort of half-vow,
      half-contract, made in the morning. Jacob said, "If God will be with me
      and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and
      raiment to put on, so that I shall come again to my father's house in
      peace, then shall the Lord be my God." The inference deducible from this
      conditional statement is, that if God failed to complete the items
      enumerated by Jacob, then the latter would have nothing to do with him.
      Jacob was a shrewd Jew, who would have laughed to scorn the preaching,
      "Take no thought, saying, what shall we eat? or, what shall we drink? or,
      wherewithal shall we be clothed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      After this contract, Jacob went on his journey, and reached the house of
      his mother's brother, Laban, into whose service he entered. "Diamond cut
      diamond" would be an appropriate heading to the tale which gives the
      transactions between Jacob the Jew and Laban the son of Nahor. Laban had
      two daughters. Rachel, the youngest, was "beautiful and well-favored;"
      Leah, the elder, was "blear-eyed." Jacob served for the pretty one; but on
      the wedding-day Laban made a feast, and gave Jacob the ugly Leah instead
      of the pretty Rachel. Jacob being (according to Josephs) both in drink and
      in the dark, it was morning ere he discovered his error. After this Jacob
      served for Rachel also, and then the remainder of the chapter of Jacob's
      servitude to Laban is but the recital of a series of frauds and
      trickeries. Jacob embezzled Laban's property, and Laban misappropriated
      and changed Jacob's wages. In fact, if Jacob had not possessed the
      advantage of divine aid, he would probably have failed in the endeavor to
      cheat his master; but God, who says "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's
      house, nor anything that is thy neighbor's," encouraged Jacob in his
      career of criminality. At last, Jacob, having amassed a large quantity of
      property, determined to abscond from his employment, and taking advantage
      of his uncle's absence at sheepshearing, "he stole away unawares," taking
      with him his wives, his children, flocks, herds, and goods. To crown the
      whole, Rachel, worthy wife of a husband so fraudulent, stole her father's
      gods. In the present day the next phase would be the employment of Mr.
      Sergeant Vericute, of the special detective department, and the issue of
      bills as follows:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "ONE HUNDRED SHEKELS REWARD,

     Absconded, with a large amount of property,

     JACOB, THE JEW.

     Information to be given to Laban, the Syrian, at Haran, in the

     East, or to Mr. Serjeant Vericute, Scotland Yard."
</pre>
    <p>
      But in those days God's ways were not as our ways. God came to Laban in a
      dream and compounded the felony, saying, "Take heed thou speak not
      anything harshly against Jacob."* This would probably prevent Laban giving
      evidence in a police court against Jacob, and thus save him from
      transportation or penal servitude. After a reconciliation and treaty had
      been effected between Jacob and Laban, the former went on his way "and the
      angel of God met him." Angels are not included in the circle with which I
      have at present made acquaintance, and I hesitate, therefore, to comment
      on the meeting between Jacob and the angels. Balaam's ass, at a later
      period, shared the good fortune which was the lot of Jacob, for that
      animal also had a meeting with an angel. Jacob was the grandson of the
      faithful Abraham to whom angels also appeared. Perhaps angelic apparitions
      are limited to asses and the faithful. On this point I do not venture to
      assert, and but timidly suggest. It is somewhat extraordinary that Jacob
      should have manifested no surprise at meeting a host of angels. Still more
      worthy of note is it that our good translators elevate the same words into
      "angels" in verse 1, which they degrade into "messengers" in verse 3. John
      Bellamy, in his translation, says the "angels were not immortal angels,"
      and it is very probable John Bellamy was right.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Genesis xxxi, 24, Douay version.
</pre>
    <p>
      Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau, and heard that the latter was
      coming to meet him followed by 400 men. Jacob, a timorous knave at best,
      became terribly afraid. He, doubtless, remembered the wrongs inflicted
      upon Esau, the cruel extortion of the birthright, and the fraudulent
      obtainment of the dying Isaac's blessing. He, therefore, sent forward to
      his brother Esau a large present as a peace offering. He also divided the
      remainder of his flocks, herds, and goods, into two divisions, that if one
      were smitten, the other might escape; sending these on, he was left alone.
      While alone he wrestled with either a man, or an angel, or God. The text
      says "a man," the heading to the chapter says "an angel," and Jacob
      himself says that he has "seen God face to face." Whether God, angel, or
      man, it was not a fair wrestle, and were the present editor of <i>Bell's
      Life</i> referee, he would, unquestionably, declare it to be most unfair
      to touch "the hollow of Jacob's thigh" so as to put it "out of joint,"
      and, consequently, award the result of the match to Jacob. Jacob,
      notwithstanding the injury, still kept his grip, and the apocryphal
      wrestler, finding himself no match at fair struggling, and that foul play
      was unavailing, now tried entreaty, and said, "Let me go, for the day
      breaketh." Spirits never appear in the daytime, when, if they did appear,
      they could be seen and examined; they are more often visible in the
      twilight, in the darkness, and in dreams. Jacob would not let go, his
      life's instinct for bargaining prevailed, and probably, because he could
      get nothing else, he insisted on his opponent's blessing before he let him
      go. In the Roman Catholic version of the bible there is the following
      note: Chap, xxxii, 24. <i>A man, etc.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "This was an angel in human shape, as we learn from <i>Osee</i> (xii, 4).
      He is called <i>God</i> (xv, 28 and 30), because he represented the son of
      God. This wrestling in which Jacob, assisted by God, was a match for an
      angel, was so ordered (v. 28) that he might learn by this experiment of
      the divine assistance, that neither Esau nor any other man should have
      power to hurt him." How elevating it must be to the true believer to
      conceive God helping Jacob to wrestle with his own representative. Read
      prayerfully, doubtless, the spiritual and inner meaning of the text (if it
      have one) is most transcendental. Read sensibly, the literal and only
      meaning the text conveys is that of an absurd tradition of an ignorant
      age. On the morrow Jacob met Esau:
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and
      kissed him; and they wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met? And he said
      these are to find grace in the sight of my lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto
      thyself."
    </p>
    <p>
      The following expressive comment, from the able pen of Mr. Holyoake,
      deserves transcription: "The last portion of the history of Jacob and Esau
      is very instructive. The coward fear of Jacob to meet his brother is well
      delineated. He is subdued by a sense of his treacherous guilt. The noble
      forgiveness of Esau invests his memory with more respect than all the
      wealth Jacob won, and all the blessings of the Lord he received. Could I
      change my name from Jacob to Esau, I would do it in honor of him. The
      whole incident has a dramatic interest. There is nothing in the Old or New
      Testament equal to it. The simple magnanimity of Esau is scarcely
      surpassed by anything in Plutarch. In the conduct of Esau we see the
      triumph of time, of filial affection, and generosity over a deep sense of
      execrable treachery, unprovoked and irrevocable injury." Was not Esau a
      merciful, generous man? Yet God hated him, and shut him out of all share
      in the promised land. Was not Jacob a mean, prevaricating knave, a crafty,
      abject cheat? Yet God loved and rewarded him. How great are the mysteries
      in this bible representation of an all-good and all-loving God thus hating
      good and loving evil. At the time of the wrestling, a promise was made,
      which is afterward repeated by God to Jacob, that the latter should not be
      any more called Jacob, but Israel. This promise was not strictly kept; the
      name "Jacob" being used repeatedly, mingled with that of Israel in the
      after part of Jacob's history. Jacob had a large family; his sons are
      reputedly the heads of the twelve Jewish tribes. We have not much space to
      notice them: suffice it to say that one Joseph, who was much loved by his
      father, was sold by his brethren into slavery. This transaction does not
      seem to have called for any special reproval from God. Joseph, who from
      early life was skilled in dreams, succeeded by interpreting the visions of
      Pharaoh in obtaining a sort of premiership in Egypt; while filling this
      office he managed to act like the Russells and the Greys of our own time.
      We are told that he "<i>placed</i> his father and his brethren, and gave
      them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land." Joseph
      made the parallel still stronger between himself and a more modern head of
      the Treasury Bench; he not only gave his own family the best place in the
      land, but he also, by a trick of statecraft, obtained the land for the
      king, made slaves of the people, and made it a law over the land of Egypt
      that the king should be entitled to one-fifth of the produce, always, of
      course, excepting and saving the rights of the priest. Judah, another
      brother, sought to have burned a woman by whom he had a child. A third,
      named Reuben, was guilty of the grossest vice, equaled only by that of
      Absalon the son of David; of Simeon and Levi, two more of Jacob's sons, it
      is said that "Instruments of cruelty were in their habitations;" their
      conduct, as detailed in the 34th chapter of Genesis, alike shocks by its
      treachery and its mercilessness. After Jacob had heard that his son Joseph
      was governor in Egypt, but before he had journeyed farther than
      Beer-sheba, God spake unto him in the visions of the night, and probably
      forgetting that he had given him a new name, or being more accustomed to
      the old one, said, "Jacob, Jacob," and then told him to go down into
      Egypt, where Jacob died after a residence of about seventeen years, when
      147 years of age. Before Jacob died he blessed, first the sons of Joseph,
      and then his own children, and at the termination of his blessing to
      Ephraim and Manasseh we find the following speech addressed to Joseph:
      "Moreover, I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I
      took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow." This
      speech implies warlike pursuit on the part of Jacob, of which the bible
      gives no record, and which seems incompatible with his recorded life. The
      sword of craft and the bow of cunning are the only weapons in the use of
      which he was skilled. When his sons murdered and robbed the Hivites, fear
      seems to have been Jacob's most prominent characteristic. It is not my
      duty, nor have I space here, to advocate any theory of interpretation, but
      it may be well to mention that many learned men contend that the whole
      history of Jacob is but an allegory. That the twelve patriarchs but typify
      the twelve signs of the zodiac, as do the twelve great gods of the Pagans,
      and twelve apostles of the gospels.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the history of Jacob it is hard to draw any conclusions favorable to
      the man whose life is narrated. To heap additional epithets on his memory
      would be but waste of time and space. I conclude by regretting that if God
      loved one brother and hated another, he should have so unfortunately
      selected for his love the one whose whole career shows him in a most
      despicable light.

    <h2>
      NEW LIFE OF ABRAHAM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Most undoubtedly father Abraham is a personage whose history should
      command our attention, if only because he figures as the founder of the
      Jewish race&mdash;a race which, having been promised protection and favor
      by Deity, appear to have experienced little else besides the infliction,
      or sufferance of misfortune and misery. Men are taught to believe that
      God, following out a solemn covenant made with Abraham, suspended the
      operations of Nature to aggrandize the Jews; that he promised always to
      bless and favor them if they adhered to his worship and obeyed the
      priests. The promised blessings were, usually, political authority,
      individual happiness and sexual power, long life, and great wealth; the
      threatened curses for idolatry or disobedience: disease, loss of property
      and children, mutilation, death. Among the blessings: the right to kill,
      plunder, and ravish their enemies, with protection, while pious, against
      any subjection to retaliatory measures. And all this because they were
      Abraham's children!
    </p>
    <p>
      Abraham is an important personage. Without Abraham, no Jesus, no
      Christianity, no Church of England, no bishops, no tithes, no church
      rates. But for Abraham England would have lost all these blessings.
      Abraham was the great-grandfather of Judah, the head of the tribe to which
      God's father, Joseph, belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      In gathering materials for a short biographical sketch, we are at the same
      time comforted and dismayed by the fact that the only reliable account of
      Abraham's career is that furnished by the book of Genesis, supplemented by
      a few brief references in other parts of the bible, and that, outside
      "God's perfect and infallible revelation to man," there is no reliable
      account of Abraham's existence at all. We are comforted by the thought
      that Genesis is unquestioned by the faithful, and is at present protected
      by Church and State against heretic assaults; but we are dismayed when we
      think that, if Infidelity, encouraged by Colenso and Kalisch, upsets
      Genesis, Abraham will have little historical claim on our attention Some
      philologists have asserted that Brama and Abraham are alike corruptions of
      Abba Rama, or Abrama, and that Sarah is identical with Sarasvati. Abram,
      is a Chaldean compound, meaning father of the elevated, or exalted father
      [&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;] is a compound of Chaldee and Arabic, signifying
      father of a multitude. In part V of his work Colenso mentions that Adonis
      was formerly identified with Abram, "high father," Adonis being the
      personified sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving incomprehensible philology for the ordinary authorized version of
      our bibles, we find that Abraham was the son of Terah. The text does not
      expressly state where Abraham was born, and I can not therefore describe
      his birthplace with that accuracy of detail which a true believer might
      desire, but I may add that he "dwelt in old time on the other side of the
      flood." (Joshua xxiv, 2, 3.) The situation of such dwelling involves a
      geographical problem most unlikely to be solved unless the inquirer is
      "half seas over." Abraham was born when Terah, his father, was seventy
      years of age; and, accord-ing to Genesis, Terah and his family came forth
      out of Ur of the Chaldees, and went to Haran and dwelt there. We turn to
      the map to look for Ur of the Chaldees, anxious to discover it as possibly
      Abraham's place of nativity, but find that the translators of God's
      inspired word have taken a slight liberty with the text by substituting
      "Ur of the Chaldees" for "Aur Kasdim," the latter being, in plain English,
      <i>the light of the magi, or conjurers, or astrologers</i>. [&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;]
      is stated by Kalisch to have been made the basis for many extraordinary
      legends, as to Abraham's rescue from the flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abraham, being born&mdash;according to Hebrew chronology, 2,083 years
      after the creation, and according to the Septuagint 3,549 years after the
      event&mdash;when his father was seventy, grew so slowly that when his
      father reached the good old age of 205 years, Abraham had only arrived at
      75 years, having, apparently, lost no less than 60 year's growth during
      his father's lifetime. St. Augustine and St Jerome gave this up as a
      difficulty inexplicable. Calmet endeavors to explain it, and makes it
      worse. But what real difficulty is there? Do you mean, dear reader, that
      it is impossible Abraham could have lived 135 years, and yet be only 75
      years of age? Is this your objection? It is a sensible one, I admit, but
      it is an Infidel one. Eschew sense, and, retaining only religion, ever
      remember that with God all things are possible. Indeed, I have read myself
      that gin given to young children stunts their growth; and who shall say
      what influence of the spirit prevented the full development of Abraham's
      years? It is a slight question whether Abraham and his two brothers were
      not born the same year; if this be so, he might have been a small child,
      and not grown so quickly as he would have otherwise done. "The Lord" spoke
      to Abraham, and promised to make of him a great nation, to bless those who
      blessed Abraham, and to curse those who cursed him. I do not know
      precisely which Lord it was that spake unto Abraham. In the Hebrew it says
      it was [&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;] Jeue, or, as our translators call it,
      Jehovah; but as God said (Exodus vi, 2) that by the name "Jehovah was I
      not known" to either Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob, we must conclude either
      that the omniscient Deity had forgotten the matter, or that a counterfeit
      Lord had assumed a title to which he had no right. The word Jehovah, which
      the book of Exodus says Abraham did not know, is nearly always the name by
      which Abraham addresses or speaks of the Jewish Deity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abraham having been promised protection by the God of Truth, initiated his
      public career with a diplomacy of statement worthy of Talleyrand, Thiers,
      or Gladstone. He represented his wife Sarah as his sister, which, if true,
      is a sad reproach to the marriage. The ruling Pharaoh, hearing the beauty
      of Sarah commended, took her into his house, she being at that time a fair
      Jewish dame, between 60 and 70 years of age, and he entreated Abraham well
      for her sake, and he had sheep and oxen, asses and servants, and camels.
      We do not read that Abraham objected in any way to the loss of his wife.
      The Lord, who is all-just, finding out that Pharaoh had done wrong, not
      only punished the king, but also punished the king's household, who could
      hardly have interfered with his misdoings. Abraham got his wife back, and
      went away much richer by the transaction. Whether the conduct of father
      Abraham in pocketing quietly the price of the insult&mdash;or honor&mdash;offered
      to his wife is worthy of modern imitation, is a question I leave to be
      discussed by Convocation when it has finished with the Athanasian Creed.
      After this transaction we are not surprised to hear that Abraham was very
      rich in "silver and gold." So was the Duke of Marlborough after the King
      had taken his sister in similar manner into his house. In verse 19 of
      chapter xii, there is a curious mistranslation in our version. The text
      is: "It is for that I had taken her for my wife," our version has: "<i>I
      might have taken</i> her." The Douay so translates as to take a middle
      phrase, leaving it doubtful whether or not Pharaoh actually took Sarah as
      his wife. In any case, the Egyptian king acted well throughout. Abraham
      plays the part of a timorous, contemptible hypocrite. Strong enough to
      have fought for his wife, he sold her. Yet Abraham was blessed for his
      faith, and his conduct is our pattern!
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite his timorousness in the matter of his wife, Abraham was a man of
      wonderful courage and warlike ability. To rescue his relative, Lot:&mdash;with
      whom he could not live on the same land without quarreling, both being
      religious&mdash;he armed 318 servants, and fought with four powerful
      kings, defeating them and recovering the spoil. Abraham's victory was so
      decisive that the king of Sodom, who fled and fell (xiv, 10) in a previous
      encounter, now met Abraham alive (see v, 17), to congratulate him on his
      victory. Abraham was also offered bread and wine by Melchisedek, King of
      Salem, priest of the Most High God. Where was Salem? Some identify it with
      Jerusalem, which it can not be, as Jebus was not so named until after the
      time of the Judges (Judges xix, 10). How does this King, of this unknown
      Salem, never heard of before or after, come to be priest of the Most High
      God? These are queries for divines&mdash;orthodox disciples believe
      without inquiring. Melchisedek was most unfortunate as far as genealogy is
      concerned. He had no father. I do not mean by this that any bar sinister
      defaced his escutcheon. He not only was without a father, but without
      mother also; he had no beginning of days or end of life, and is therefore
      probably at the present time an extremely old gentleman, who would be an
      invaluable acquisition to any antiquarian association fortunate enough to
      cultivate his acquaintance. God having promised Abraham a numerous family,
      and the promise not having been in any part fulfilled, the patriarch grew
      uneasy and remonstrated with the Lord, who explained the matter thoroughly
      to Abraham when the latter was in a deep sleep, and a dense darkness
      prevailed. Religions explanations come with greater force under these or
      similar conditions. Natural or artificial light and clear-sightedness are
      always detrimental to spiritual manifestations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abraham's wife had a maid named Hagar, and she bore to Abraham a child
      named Ishmael; at the time Ishmael was born, Abraham was 86 years of age.
      Just before Ishmael's birth Hagar was so badly treated that she ran away.
      As she was only a slave, God persuaded Hagar to return, and humble herself
      to her mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirteen years afterward God appeared to Abraham, and instituted the rite
      of circumcision&mdash;which rite had been practiced long before by other
      nations&mdash;and again renewed the promise. The rite of circumcision was
      not only practiced by nations long anterior to that of the Jews, but
      appears, in many cases, not even to have been pretended as a religious
      rite. (See Kalisch, Genesis, p. 386; Cahen, Genese, p. 43) After God had
      "left off talking with him, God went up from Abraham." As God is infinite,
      he did not, of course, go up; but still the bible says God went up, and it
      is the duty of the people to believe that he did so, especially as the
      infinite Deity then and now resides habitually in "heaven," wherever that
      may be. Again the Lord appeared to Abraham, either as three men or angels,
      or as one of the three; and Abraham, who seemed hospitably inclined,
      invited the three to wash their feet, and to rest under the tree, and gave
      butter and milk and dressed calf, tender and good, to them, and they did
      eat; and after the inquiry as to where Sarah then was, the promise of a
      son is repeated. Sarah&mdash;then by her own admission an old woman,
      stricken in years&mdash;laughed when she heard this, and the Lord said,
      "Wherefore did Sarah laugh?" and Sarah denied it, but the Lord said, "Nay,
      but thou didst laugh." The three then went toward Sodom, and Abraham went
      with them as a guide; and the Lord explained to Abraham that some sad
      reports had reached him about Sodom and Gomorrah, and that he was then
      going to find out whether the report was reliable. God is infinite, and
      was always therefore at Sodom and Gomorrah, but had apparently been
      temporarily absent; he is omniscient, and therefore knew everything which
      was happening at Sodom and Gomorrah, but he did not know whether or not
      the people were as wicked as they had been represented to him. God, Job
      tells us, "put no trust in his servants, and his angels he charged with
      folly." Between the rogues and the fools, therefore, the all-wise and
      all-powerful God seems to be as liable to be mistaken in the reports made
      to him as any monarch might be in reports made by his ministers. Two of
      the three men, or angels, went on to Sodom, and left the Lord with
      Abraham, who began to remonstrate with Deity on the wholesale destruction
      contemplated, and asked him to spare the city if fifty righteous should be
      found within it. God said, "If I find fifty righteous within the city,
      then will I spare the place for their sakes." God being all-wise, he knew
      there were not fifty in Sodom, and was deceiving Abraham. By dint of hard
      bargaining, in thorough Hebrew fashion, Abraham, whose faith seemed
      tempered by distrust, got the stipulated number reduced to ten, and then
      "the Lord went his way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob Ben Chajim, in his introduction to the Rabbinical bible, p. 28,
      tells us that the Hebrew text used to read in verse 22: "And Jehovah still
      stood before Abraham;" but the scribes altered it, and made Abraham stand
      before the Lord, thinking the original text offensive to Deity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 18th chapter of Genesis has given plenty of work to the divines.
      Augustin contended that God can take food, though he does not require it.
      Justin compared "the eating of God with the devouring power of the fire."
      Kalisch sorrows over the holy fathers "who have taxed all their ingenuity
      to make the act of eating compatible with the attributes of Deity."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Epistle to the Romans, Abraham's faith is greatly praised. We are
      told, iv, 19, 20, that:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he
      was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong
      in faith, giving glory to God."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, so far from Abraham giving God glory, we are told in Genesis, xvii,
      17, that:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, shall a
      child be born unto him that is an hundred years old, and shall Sarah, that
      is ninety years old, bear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. Mr. Boutell says that "the declaration which caused Sarah to
      'laugh,' shows the wonderful familiarity which was then permitted to
      Abraham in his communications with God."
    </p>
    <p>
      After the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Abraham journeyed south and
      sojourned in Gerar, and either untaught or too well taught by his previous
      experience, again represented his wife as his sister, and Abimelech, king
      of Gerar, sent and took Sarah. As before, we find neither remonstrance nor
      resistance recorded on the part of Abraham. This time God punished, <i>a
      la</i> Malthus, the women in Abimelech's house for an offense they did not
      commit, and Sarah was again restored to her husband, with sheep, oxen,
      men-servants, and women-servants, and money. Infidels object that the
      bible says Sarah "was old and well stricken in age;" that "it had ceased
      to be with her after the manner of women;" that she was more than ninety
      years of age; and that it is not likely King Abimelech would fall in love
      with an ugly old woman. We reply, "<i>chacun a son gout?</i>" It is clear
      that Sarah had not ceased to be attractive, as God resorted to especial
      means to protect her virtue from Abimelech. At length Isaac is born, and
      his mother Sarah now urges Abraham to expel Hagar and her son, "and the
      thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son;" the mother
      being only a bondwoman does not seem to have troubled him. God, however,
      approving Sarah's notion, Hagar is expelled, "and she departed and
      wandered in the wilderness, and the water was spent in the bottle, and she
      cast the child under one of the shrubs." She had apparently carried the
      child, who being at least more than fourteen, and according to some
      calculations as much as seventeen years of age, must have been a heavy
      child to carry in a warm climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      God never did tempt any man at any time, but he "did tempt Abraham" to
      kill Isaac by offering him as a burnt offering. The doctrine of human
      sacrifice is one of the holy mysteries of Christianity, as taught in the
      Old and New Testament. Of course, judged from a religious or biblical
      standpoint, it can not be wrong, as, if it were, God would not have
      permitted Jephtha to sacrifice his daughter by offering her as a burnt
      offering, nor have tempted Abraham to sacrifice his son, nor have said in
      Leviticus, "None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be
      redeemed; but shall surely be put to death" (xxvii, 29), nor have in the
      New Testament worked out the monstrous sacrifice of his only son Jesus, at
      the same time son and begetting father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abraham did not seem to be entirely satisfied with his own conduct when
      about to kill Isaac, for he not only concealed from his servants his
      intent, but positively stated that which was not true, saying, "I and the
      lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you." If he meant that
      he and Isaac would come again to them, then he knew that the sacrifice
      would not take place. Nay, Abraham even deceived his own son, who asked
      him where was the lamb for the burnt offering? But we learn from the New
      Testament that Abraham acted in this and other matters "by faith," so his
      falsehoods and evasions, being results and aids of faith, must be dealt
      with in an entirely different manner from transactions of every-day life.
      Just as Abraham stretched forth his hand to slay his son, the angel of the
      Lord called to him from heaven, and prevented the murder, saying, "Now I
      know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son." This
      would convey the impression that up to that moment the angel of the Lord
      was not certain upon the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Genesis xiii, God says to Abraham, "Lift up now thine eyes, and look
      from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward and
      westward. For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and
      to thy seed for ever. Arise, walk through the land, in the length of it,
      and in the breadth of it, for I will give it unto thee." Yet, as is
      admitted by the Rev. Charles Boutell, in his "Bible Dictionary," "The only
      portion of territory in that land of promise, of which Abraham became
      possessed" was a graveyard, which he had bought and paid for. Although
      Abraham was too old to have children <i>before</i> the birth of Isaac, he
      had many children <i>after</i> Isaac is born. He lived to "a good old
      age," and died "full of years," but was yet younger than any of those who
      preceded him, and whose ages are given in the bible history, except Nahor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abraham gave "all that he had to Isaac," but appears to have distributed
      the rest of the property among his other children, who were sent to enjoy
      it somewhere down East.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the New Testament, Abraham is now in Paradise, but Abraham in
      heaven is scarcely an improvement upon Abraham on-earth. When he was
      entreated by an unfortunate in hell for a drop of water to cool his
      tongue, father Abraham replied, "Son, remember that in thy life-time thou
      receivedst thy good things, and now thou art tormented," as if the
      reminiscence of past good would alleviate present and future continuity of
      evil.

    <h2>
      NEW LIFE OF MOSES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The "Life of Abraham" was presented to our readers, because, as the
      nominal founder of the Jewish race, his position entitled him to that
      honor. The "Life of David," because, as one of the worst men and worst
      kings ever known, his history might afford matter for reflection to
      admirers of monarchical institutions and matter for comment to the
      advocates of a republican form of government. The "Life of Jacob" served
      to show how basely mean and contemptibly deceitful a man might become, and
      yet enjoy God's love. Having given thus a brief outline of the career of
      the patriarch, the king, and the knave, the life of a priest naturally
      presents itself as the most fitting to complement the present quadrifid
      series.

      Moses, the great grandson of Levi, was born in Egypt, not far distant from
      the banks of the Nile, a river world-famous for its inundations, made
      familiar to ordinary readers by the travelers who have journeyed to
      discover its source, and held in bad repute by strangers, especially on
      account of the carnivorous Saurians who infest its waters. The mother and
      father of our hero were both of the tribe of Levi, and were named Jochebed
      and Amram. The infant Moses was, at the age of three months, placed in an
      ark of bulrushes by the river's brink. This was done in order to avoid the
      decree of extermination propounded by the reigning Pharaoh against the
      male Jewish children. The daughter of Pharaoh, coming down to the river to
      bathe, found the child and took compassion upon him, adopting him as her
      son. Of the early life of Moses we have but scanty record. We are told in
      the New Testament that he was learned in the wisdom of the Egyptians,* and
      that, "when he was come to years he refused by faith** to be called the
      son of Pharaoh's daughter." Perhaps the record from which the New
      Testament writers quoted has been lost; it is certain that the present
      version of the Old Testament does not contain those statements. The record
      which is lost <i>may</i> have been God's original revelation to man, and
      of which our bible <i>may</i> be an incomplete version. I am little
      grieved by the supposition that a revelation may have been lost, being,
      for my own part, more inclined to think that no revelation has ever been
      made. Josephus says that, when quite a baby, Moses trod contemptuously on
      the crown of Egypt. The Egyptian monuments and Exodus are both silent on
      this point. Josephus also tells us that Moses led the Egyptians in war
      against the Ethiopians, and married Tharbis, the daughter of the Ethiopian
      monarch. This also is omitted both in Egyptian history and in the sacred
      record. When Moses was grown, according to the Old Testament, or when he
      was 40 years of age according to the New, "it came into his heart to visit
      his brethren the children of Israel." "And he spied an Egyptian smiting a
      Hebrew." "And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there
      was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand." The New
      Testament says that he did it, "for he supposed that his brethren would
      understand how that God, by his hand, would deliver them."***

      But this is open to the following objections: The Old Testament says
      nothing of the kind; there was no man to see the homicide, and as Moses
      hid the body, it is hard to conceive how he could expect the Israelites to
      understand a matter of which they not only had no knowledge whatever, but
      which he himself did not think was known to them; if there were really no
      man present, the story of the after accusation against Moses needs
      explanation: it might be further objected that it does not appear that
      Moses at that time did even himself conceive that he had any mission from
      God to deliver his people. Moses fled from the wrath of Pharaoh, and dwelt
      in Midian, where he married the daughter of one Reuel, or Jethro. This
      name is not of much importance, but it is strange that if Moses wrote the
      books of the Pentateuch he was not more exact in designating so near a
      relation. While acting as shepherd to his father-in-law, "he led the flock
      to the back side of the desert," and "the angel of the Lord appeared to
      him in a flame of fire:" that is, the angel was either a flame, or was the
      object which was burning, for this angel appeared in the midst of a bush
      which burned with fire, but was not consumed. This flame appears to have
      been a luminous one, for it was a "great sight," and attracted Moses, who
      turned aside to see it. But the luminosity would depend on substance
      ignited and rendered inacandescent. Is the angel of the Lord a substance
      susceptible of ignition and incandescence? Who knoweth? If so, will the
      fallen angels ignite and burn in hell! God called unto Moses out of the
      midst of the bush. It is hard to conceive an infinite God in the middle of
      a bush; yet as the law of England says that we must not "deny the Holy
      Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments to be of divine authority," in
      order not to break the law, I advise all to believe that, in addition to
      being in the middle of a bush, the infinite and all-powerful God also sat
      on the top of a box, dwelt sometimes in a tent, afterward in a temple;
      although invisible, appeared occasionally; and being a spirit without body
      or parts, was hypostatically incarnate as a man. Moses, when spoken to by
      God, "hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God." If Moses had
      known that God was <i>invisible</i> he would have escaped this fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      God told Moses that the cry of the children of Israel had reached him, and
      that he had <i>come down</i> to deliver them, and that Moses was to lead
      them out of Egypt. Moses does not seem to have placed entire confidence in
      the phlegmonic divine communication, and asked, when the Jews should
      question him on the name of the Deity, what answer should he make? It does
      not appear from this that the Jews, if they had so completely forgotten
      God's name, had much preserved the recollection of the promise
      comparatively so recently made to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. The
      answer given according to our version is "I am that I am;" according to
      the Douay, "I am who am." God, in addition, told Moses that the Jews
      should spoil the Egyptians of their wealth; but even this promise of
      plunder so congenial to the nature of a bill-discounting Jew of the bible
      type, did not avail to overcome the scruples of Moses. God therefore
      taught him to throw his rod on the ground, and thus transform it into a
      serpent, from which pseudo-serpent Moses at first fled in fear, but on his
      taking it by the tail it resumed its original shape, Moses, with even
      other wonders at command, still hesitated; he had an impediment in his
      speech. God cured this by the appointment of Aaron, who was eloquent, to
      aid his brother. God directed Moses to return to Egypt, but his parting
      words must somewhat have damped the future legislator's hope of any speedy
      or successful ending to his mission. God said, "I will harden Pharaoh's
      heart that he shall not let the people go." On the journey back to Egypt
      God met Moses "by the way in the inn, and sought to kill him." I am
      ignorant as to the causes which prevented the omnipotent Deity from
      carrying out his intention; the text does not explain the matter, and I am
      not a bishop or a D. D., and I do not therefore feel justified in putting
      my assumptions in place of God's revelation. Moses and Aaron went to
      Pharaoh, and asked that the Jews might be permitted to go three days'
      journey in the wilderness; but the King of Egypt not only refused their
      request, but gave them additional tasks, and in consequence Moses and
      Aaron went again to the Lord, who told them, "I appeared unto Abraham,
      unto Isaac, and unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty; but by my name
      Jehovah was I not known unto them." Whether God had forgotten that the
      name of Jehovah was known to Abraham, or whether he was here deceiving
      Moses and Aaron, are points the solution of which I leave to the faithful,
      referring them to the fact that Abraham called a place* Jehovah-Jireh.

    <p>
      After this Moses and Aaron again went to Pharaoh and worked wonderfully in
      his presence. Thaumaturgy is coming into fashion again, but the exploits
      of Moses far exceeded any of those performed by Mr. Home or the Davenport
      brothers. Aaron flung down his rod, and it became a serpent; the Egyptian
      magicians flung down their rods, which became serpents also; but the rod
      of Aaron, as though it had been a Jew money-lender or a tithe collecting
      parson, swallowed up these miraculous competitors, and the Jewish leaders
      could afford to laugh at their defeated rival conjurors. Moses and Aaron
      carried on the miracle-working for some time. All the water of the land of
      Egypt was turned by them into blood, but the magicians did so with their
      enchantments, and it had no effect on Pharaoh. Then showers of frogs, at
      the instance of Aaron, covered the land of Egypt; but the Egyptians did so
      with their enchantments, and frogs abounded still more plentifully. The
      Jews next tried their hands at the production of lice, and here&mdash;to
      the glory of God be it said&mdash;the infidel Egyptians failed to imitate
      them. It is written that "cleanliness is next to godliness," but we can
      not help thinking that godliness must have been far from cleanliness when
      the former so soon resulted in lice. The magicians were now entirely
      discomfited. The preceding wonders seem to have affected all the land of
      Egypt; but in the next miracle the swarms of flies sent were confined to
      Egyptians only, and were not extended to Goshen, in which the Israelites
      dwelt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next plague in connection with the ministration of Moses and Aaron was
      that "all the cattle of Egypt died." After "all the cattle" were dead, a
      boil was sent, breaking forth with blains upon man and beast. This failing
      in effect, Moses afterward stretched forth his hand and smote "both man
      and beast" with hail, then covered the land with locusts, and followed
      this with a thick darkness throughout the land&mdash;a darkness which <i>might</i>
      have been felt. Whether it was felt is a matter on which I am unable to
      pass an opinion. After this, the Egyptians being terrified by the
      destruction of their first-born children, the Jews, at the instance of
      Moses, borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and
      raiment; and they spoiled the Egyptians. The fact is, that the Egyptians
      were in the same position as the payers of church rates, tithes, vicars'
      rates, and Easter dues: they lent to the Lord's people, who are good
      borrowers, but slow when repayment is required. They prefer promising you
      a crown of glory to paying you at once five shillings in silver. Moses led
      the Jews through the Red Sea, which proved a ready means of escape, as may
      be easily read in Exodus, which says that the Lord "made the sea dry land"
      for the Israelites, and afterward not only overwhelmed in it the Egyptians
      who sought to follow them, but, as Josephus tells us, the current of the
      sea actually carried to the camp of the Hebrews the arms of the Egyptians,
      so that the wandering Jews might not be destitute of weapons. After this
      the Israelities were led by Moses into Shur, where they were without water
      for three days, and the water they afterward found was too bitter to drink
      until a tree had been cast into the well. The Israelites were then fed
      with manna, which, when gathered on Friday, kept for the Sabbath, but
      rotted if kept from one week day to another. The people grew tired of
      eating manna, and complained, and God sent fire among them and burned them
      up in the uttermost parts of the camp; and after this the people wept and
      said, "Who shall give us flesh to eat? We remember the fish we did eat in
      Egypt freely; the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions
      and the garlic; but now there is nothing at all beside this manna before
      our eyes." This angered the Lord, and he gave them a feast of quails, and
      while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger
      of the Lord was kindled, and he smote the Jewish people with a very great
      plague.*

      The people again in Rephidim were without water, and Moses therefore smote
      the Rock of Horeb with his rod, and water came out of the rock. At
      Rephidim the Amalekites and the Jews fought together, and while they
      fought, Moses, like a prudent general, went to the top of a hill,
      accompanied by Aaron and Hur, and it came to pass that when Moses held up
      his hands Israel prevailed, and when he let down his hands Amalek
      prevailed. But Moses' hands were heavy, and they took a stone and put it
      under him, and he sat thereon, and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the
      one on the one side and the other on the other side, and his hands were
      steady until the going down of the sun, and Joshua discomfited Amalek, and
      his people with the edge of the sword. How the true believer ought to
      rejoice that the stone was so convenient, as otherwise the Jews might have
      been slaughtered, and there might have been no royal line of David, no
      Jesus, no Christianity. That stone should be more valued than the precious
      black stone of the Moslem; it is the corner-stone of the system, the stone
      which supported the Mosaic rule. God is everywhere, but Moses went <i>up</i>
      unto him, and the Lord called to him <i>out</i> of a mountain and came to
      him <i>in</i> a thick cloud, and descended on Mount Sinai <i>in</i> a
      fire, in consequence of which the mountain smoked, and the Lord <i>came
      down upon the top</i> of the mountain and called Moses <i>up</i> to him;
      and then the Lord gave Moses the Ten Commandments, and also those precepts
      which follow, in which Jews are permitted to buy their fellow-countrymen
      for six years, and in which it is provided that, if the slave-master shall
      give his six-year slave a wife, and she bear him sons or daughters, that
      the wife and the children shall be the property of her master. In these
      precepts it is also permitted that a man may sell his own daughter for the
      most base purposes. Also that a master may beat his slave so that if he do
      not die until a few days after the ill-treatment, the master shall escape
      justice because the slave is his money. Also that Jews may buy strangers
      and keep them as slaves for ever. While Moses was up in the mount the
      people clamored for Aaron to make them gods. Moses had stopped away so
      long that the people gave him up for lost. Aaron, whose duty it was to
      have pacified and restrained them, and to have kept them in the right
      faith, did nothing of the kind. He induced them to bring all their gold,
      and then made it into a calf, before which he built an altar, and then
      proclaimed a feast. Manners and customs change. In those days the Jews did
      see the God that Aaron took their gold for, but now the priests take the
      people's gold, and the poor contributors do not even see a calf for their
      pains, unless indeed they are near a mirror at the time when they are
      making their voluntary contributions. And the Lord told Moses what
      happened, and said, "I have seen this people, and behold it is a
      stiff-necked people. Now, therefore, let me alone that my wrath may wax
      hot against them, and that I may consume them." Moses would not comply
      with God's request, but remonstrated, and expostulated, and begged him not
      to afford the Egyptians an opportunity of speaking against him. Moses
      succeeded in changing the unchangeable, and the Lord repented of the evil
      which he thought to do unto his people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Moses would not let God's "wrath wax hot" his own "anger waxed
      hot," and he broke, in his rage, the two tables of stone which God had
      given him, and on which the Lord had graven and written with his own
      finger. We have now no means of knowing in what language God wrote, or
      whether Moses afterward took any pains to rivet together the broken
      pieces. It is almost to be wondered at that the Christian Evidence
      Societies have not sent missionaries to search for these pieces of the
      tables, which may even yet remain beneath the mount. Moses took the calf
      which they had made and burned it with fire and ground it to powder and
      strewed it upon water and made the children of Israel drink of it. After
      this Moses armed the priests and killed 3,000 Jews, "and the Lord plagued
      the people because they had made the calf which Aaron had made."* Moses
      afterward pitched the tabernacle without the camp; and the cloudy pillar
      in which the Lord went, descended and stood at the door of the tabernacle;
      and the Lord talked to Moses "face to face, as a man would to his
      friend."** And the Lord then told Moses, "Thou canst not see my face, for
      there shall no man see me and live."*** Before this Moses and Aaron and
      Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, "saw the God of
      Israel, and there was under his feet, as it were, a paved work of sapphire
      stone,... and upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his
      hand; also they saw God, and did eat and drink."****

      Aaron, the brother of Moses, died under very strange circumstances. The
      Lord said unto Moses, "Strip Aaron of his garments and put them upon
      Eleazar, his son, and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people and shall
      die there." And Moses did as the Lord commanded, and Aaron died there on
      the top of the mount, where Moses had taken him. There does not appear to
      have been any coroner's inquest in the time of Aaron, and the suspicious
      circumstances of the death of the brother of Moses have been passed over
      by the faithful.

      When Moses was leading the Israelites over Moab, Balak the King of the
      Moabites sent to Balaam in order to get Balaam to curse the Jews. When
      Balak's messengers were with Balaam, God came to Balaam also, and asked
      what men they were. Of course God knew, but he inquired for his own wise
      purposes, and Balaam told him truthfully. God ordered Balaam not to curse
      the Jews, and therefore the latter refused, and sent the Moabitish
      messengers away. Then Balak sent again high and mighty princes under whose
      influence Balaam went mounted on an ass, and God's anger was kindled
      against Balaam, and he sent an angel to stop him by the way; but the angel
      did not understand his business well, and the ass first ran into a field,
      and then close against the wall, and it was not until the angel removed to
      a narrower place that he succeeded in stopping the donkey; and when the
      ass saw the angel she fell down. Balaam did not see the angel at first;
      and, indeed we may take it as a fact of history that asses have always
      been the most ready to perceive angels.

      Moses may have been a great author, but we have little means of
      ascertaining what he wrote in the present day. Divines talk of Genesis to
      Deuteronomy as the five books of Moses, but Eusebius, in the fourth
      century, attributed them to Ezra, and Saint Chrysostom says that the name
      of Moses has been affixed to the books without authority, by persons
      living long after him. It is quite certain that if Moses lived 3,300 years
      ago, he did not write in square letter Hebrew, and this because the
      character has not existed so long. It is indeed doubtful if it can be
      carried back 2,000 years. The ancient Hebrew character, though probably
      older than this, yet is comparatively modern among the ancient languages
      of the earth.

      It is urged by orthodox chronologists that Moses was born about 1450 B.
      C., and that the Exodus took place about 1401 B. C. Unfortunately "there
      are no recorded dates in the Jewish Scriptures that are trustworthy."
      Moses, or the Hebrews, not being mentioned upon Egyptian monuments from
      the twelfth to the seventeenth century B. C. inclusive, and never being
      alluded to by any extant writer who lived prior to the Septuagint
      translation at Alexandria (commencing in the third century B. C.), there
      are no extraneous aids, from sources alien to the Jewish Books through
      which any information, worthy of historical acceptance, can be gathered
      elsewhere about him or them.*

      Moses died in the land of Moab when he was 120 years of age. The Lord
      buried Moses in a valley of Moab, over against Bethpeor, but no man
      knoweth of his sepulcher unto this day. Josephus says that "a cloud came
      over him on the sudden and he disappeared in a certain valley." The devil
      disputed about the body of Moses, contending with the Archangel Michael;**
      but whether the devil or the angel had the best of the discussion, the
      bible does not tell us.

      De Beauvoir Priaulx,*** looking at Moses as a counselor, leader, and
      legislator, says: "Invested with this high authority, he announced to the
      Jews their future religion, and announced it to them as a state religion,
      and as framed for a particular state, and that state only.

      He gave this religion, moreover, a creed so narrow and negative&mdash;he
      limited it to objects so purely temporal, he crowded it with observances
      so entirely ceremonial or national&mdash;that we find it difficult to
      determine whether Moses merely established this religion in order that by
      a community of worship he might induce in the tribe-divided Israelites
      that community of sentiment which would constitute them a nation; or,
      whether he only roused them to a sense of their national dignity, in the
      hope that they might then more faithfully perform the duties of priests
      and servants of Jehovah. In other words, we hesitate to decide whether in
      the mind of Moses the state was subservient to the purposes of religion,
      or religion to the purposes of state."

      The same writer observes* that, according to the Jewish writings, Moses

      wishes the Deity hastens to fulfill, one to whom the Deity makes known his
      designs. The relations between God and the prophet are most intimate. God
      does not disdain to answer the questions of Moses, to remove his doubts,
      and even occasionally to receive his suggestions, and to act upon them
      even in opposition to his own predetermined decrees."

      NEW LIFE OF JONAH
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jonah was the son of Amittai of Gath-hepher, which place divines identify
      with Gittah-hepher of the Children of Zebulun. Dr. Iuman says that
      Gath-hepher means "the Heifer's trough." Gesenius translates it "the
      wine-press of the well." Bible dictionaries say that Gath-hepher is the
      same as el-Meshhad, and affirm that the tomb of Jonah was "long shown on a
      rocky hill near the town." The blood of Saint Januarius is shown in Naples
      to this day. Nothing is known of the sex or life of Amittai, except that
      Jonah was his or her son, and that Gath-hepher was her or his place of
      residence; but to a true believer these two facts, even though standing
      utterly alone, will be pregnant with instruction. To the skeptic and
      railer, Amittai is as an unknown quantity in an algebraic problem. Jonah
      was not a very common proper name, [&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;] means a dove,
      and some derive it from the Arabic root&mdash;to be weak, gentle; so that
      one meaning of Jonah, according to Gesenius, would be feeble, gentle bird.
      The prophet Jonah was by no means a feeble, gentle bird; he was rather a
      bird of prey. Certainly it was his intention to become a bird of passage.
      The date of the birth of Jonah is not given; the margin of my bible dates
      the book of Jonah B. C. cir. 862, and my bible dictionary fixes the date
      of the matter to which the book relates at "about B. C. 830." If from any
      reason either of these dates should be disagreeable to the reader, he can
      choose any other date without fear of anachronism. Jonah was a prophet; so
      is Dr. Cumming, so is Brigham Young; there is no evidence that Jonah
      followed any other profession. Jonah's profit probably hardly equaled that
      realized by the Archbishop of Canterbury, but he had money enough to pay
      his fare "from the presence of the Lord" to Tarshish. The exact distance
      of this voyage may be easily calculated by remembering that the Lord is
      omnipresent, and then measuring from his boundary to Tarshish. The fare
      may be worked out by the differential calculus after evening prayer.
    </p>

      The word of the Lord came to Jonah; when or how the word came the text
      does not record, and to any devout mind it is enough to know that it came.
      The first time in the world's history that the word of the Lord ever came
      to anybody, may be taken to be when Adam and Eve "heard the voice of the
      Lord" "walking in the Garden" of Eden "in the cool of the day." Between
      the time of Adam and Jonah a long period had elapsed; but human nature,
      having had many prophets, was very wicked. The Lord wanted Jonah to go
      with a message to Nineveh. Nineveh was apparently a city of three days'
      journey in size. Allowing twenty miles for each day, this would make the
      city about 60 miles across, or about 180 miles in circumference. Some
      faint idea may be formed of this vast city, by adding together London,
      Paris, and New York, and then throwing in Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow,
      Edinburgh, Marseilles, Naples, Spurgeon's Tabernacle. Jonah knowing that
      the Lord did not always carry out his threats or perform his promises, did
      not wish to go to Nineveh, and "rose up to flee to Tarshish from the
      presence of the Lord," The Tarshish for which Jonah intended his flight
      was either in Spain or India or elsewhere. I am inclined, after deep
      reflection and examination of the best authorities, to give the preference
      to the third-named locality. When Cain went "out of the presence of the
      Lord," he went into the Land of Nod, but whether Tarshish is in that or
      some other country there is no evidence to determine. To get to Tarshish,
      Jonah&mdash;instead of going to the port of Tyre, which was the nearest to
      his reputed dwelling, and by far the most commodious&mdash;went to the
      more distant and less convenient port of Joppa, where he found a ship
      going to Tarshish; "so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to
      go with them into Tarshish, from the presence of the Lord." Jonah was,
      however, very short-sighted. Just as in the old Greek mythology, winds and
      waves are made warriors for the gods, so the God of the Hebrews "sent out
      a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so
      that the ship was like to be broken." Luckily she was not an old leaky
      vessel, over-laden and heavily insured; one which the sanctimonious owners
      desired to see at the bottom, and which the captain did not care to save.
      Christianity and civilization were yet to bring forth that glorious
      resultant, a pious English ship-owner, with a newly-painted, but, under
      the paint, a worn and rusty iron vessel, long abandoned as unfit, but now
      fresh named, and so insured that Davy Jones' locker becomes the most
      welcome haven of refuge. "The mariners were afraid.... and cast forth the
      wares" into the sea to lighten the ship. But where was Jonah during this
      noise? Men trampling on deck, hoarse and harsh words of command, and the
      fury of the storm troubled not our prophet. Sea-sickness, which spares not
      the most pious, had no effect upon him. "Jonah was gone down into the
      sides of the ship, and he lay and was fast asleep." The battering of the
      waves against the sides disturbed not his devout slumbers; the creaking of
      the vessel's timbers spoiled not his repose. Despite the pitching and
      rolling of the vessel Jonah "was fast asleep." Had he been in the
      comfortable berth of a Cunarder, it would not have been easy to sleep
      through such a storm. Had he been in the hold of a smaller vessel on the
      Bay of Biscay, finding himself now with his head lower than his heels, and
      now with his body playing hide and seek among loose articles of cargo, it
      would have required great absence of mind to prevent waking. Had he only
      been on an Irish steamer carrying cattle on deck, between Bristol and
      Cork, with a portion of the bulwarks washed away, and a squad of recruits
      "who cried every man to his God," he would have found the calmness of
      undisturbed slumber difficult. But Jonah was on board the Joppa and
      Tarshish boat, and he "was fast asleep." As the crew understood the theory
      of storms, they of course knew that when there is a tempest at sea it is
      sent by God, because he is offended by some one on board the vessel.
      Modern scientists scout this notion, and pretend to track storm waves
      across the world, and to affix storm signals in order to warn mariners.
      They actually profess to predict atmospheric changes, and to explain how
      such changes take place. Church clergymen know how futile science is, and
      how potent prayers are, for vessels at sea. The men on the Joppa vessel
      said, "every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may
      know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot
      fell upon Jonah." It was always a grave question in sacred metaphysics as
      to whether God directed Jonah's lot, and, if yes, whether the casting of
      lots is analogous to playing with loaded dice. The Bishop of Lincoln, who
      understands how far cremation may render resurrection awkward, is the only
      divine capable of thoroughly resolving this problem. For ordinary
      Christians it is enough to know that the lot fell upon Jonah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the crew commenced casting lots to find out, they had cast lots of
      their wares overboard, so that when the lot fell on Jonah it was much
      lighter than it would have been had the lot fallen upon him during his
      sleep. Still, if not stunned by the lot which fell upon him, he stood
      convicted as the cause of the tempest and the crews. "Then said they unto
      him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; What is
      thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what
      people art thou? And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the
      Lord, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land. Then
      were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done
      this? For the men-knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord, because
      he had told them. Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee,
      that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was
      tempestuous. And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the
      sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you; for I know that for my sake this
      great tempest is upon you. Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to
      the land; but they could not; for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous
      against them. Wherefore they cried unto the Lord, and said, We beseech
      thee, O Lord, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and
      lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O Lord, hast done as it pleased
      thee. So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea
      ceased from her raging." No pen can improve this story; it is so simple,
      so natural, so child-like. Every one has heard of casting oil on troubled
      waters. It stands to reason that a fat prophet would produce the same
      effect. What a striking illustration of the power of faith it will be when
      bishops leave their own sees in order to be in readiness to calm an ocean
      storm. Or if not a bishop, at least a curate; and even a lean curate, for
      with sea air, a ravenous appetite, and a White Star Line cabin bill of
      fare of breakfast, lunch, dinner, tea, and supper, fatness would soon be
      arrived at. In the interests of science I should like to see an episcopal
      prophet occasionally thrown overboard during a storm. The experiment must
      in any case be advantageous to humanity; should the tempest be stilled,
      then the ocean would be indeed the broad way, not leading to destruction;
      should the storm not be conquered, there would even then be promotion in
      the Church, and happiness to many at the mere cost of one bishop. "Now the
      Lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah." Jesus says the fish
      was a whale. A whale would have needed preparation, and the statement has
      an air of <i>vraisemblance</i>. The fish did swallow Jonah. "Jonah was in
      the belly of the fish three days and three nights." Poor Jonah! and poor
      fish! Poor Jonah, for it can scarcely be pleasant, even if you escape
      suffocation, to be in a fish's belly with too much to drink, and no room
      to swallow, and your solids either raw or too much done. Poor fish! for
      even after preparation it must be disagreeable to have one's poor stomach
      turned into a sort of prayer meeting. Jonah was taken in; but the fish
      found that taking in a parson was a feat neither easy nor healthy. After
      Jonah had uttered guttural sounds from inside the fish's belly for three
      days and three nights, the Lord spake unto the fish, and the fish was sick
      of Jonah, "and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land." Some skeptics
      urged that a whale could not have swallowed Jonah; but once, at Todmorden,
      a Church of England clergyman, who had been curate to the Reverend Charles
      Kingsley, got rid of this as an objection by assuring us that he should
      have equally believed the story had it stated that Jonah had swallowed the
      whale. And then the word of the Lord came to Jonah once more, and this
      time Jonah obeyed. He was to take God's message to the citizens of
      Nineveh. "And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he
      cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown." Should
      Jonah come to London in the present day with a similar message, he would
      meet scant courtesy from our clergy. A foreigner and using a strange
      tongue, he would probably find himself in Colney Hatch or Hanwell. To come
      to England in the name of Mahomet or Buddha, or Osiris or Jupiter, would
      have little effect. But the Ninevites do not seem even to have raised the
      question that the God of the Hebrews was not their God. They listened to
      Jonah, and "the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and
      put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. For
      word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he
      laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth and sat in ashes.
      And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the
      decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd
      nor flock, taste anything; let them not feed, nor drink water: but let man
      and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let
      them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in
      their hands." The consumption of sackcloth for covering every man and
      beast must have been rather large, and the Nineveh sackcloth manufacturers
      must have had enormous stocks on hand to supply the sudden demand. The
      city article of the <i>Nineveh Times</i>, if such a paper existed, would
      probably have described "sackcloth firm, with a tendency to rise." Man and
      beast, all dressed in or covered with sackcloth! It would be sometimes
      difficult to distinguish a Ninevite man from a Ninevite beast, the dress
      being similar for all. This is a difficulty, however, other nations have
      shared with the Ninevites. Men and women may sometimes be seen in London
      dressed in broadcloth and satins, and, though their clothing is
      distinguishable enough, their conduct is sometimes so beastly that the
      naked beasts are the more respectable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nineveh was frightened, and Nineveh moaned, and Nineveh determined to do
      wrong: no more. "And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil
      way; and God repented of the evil that he had said that he would do unto
      them; and he did it not." God, the unchangeable, changed his purpose, and
      spared the city, which in his infinite wisdom he had doomed. "But it
      displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry." It was enough to vex
      a saint to be sent to prophesy the destruction of the city in six weeks,
      and then nothing at all to happen. "And he prayed unto the Lord, and said,
      I pray thee, O Lord, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country?
      Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish." Jonah did not like to be a
      discredited prophet and cried, "Therefore now, O Lord, take, I beseech
      thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live. Then
      said the Lord, Doest thou well to be angry?" Jonah, knowing the Lord, was
      still curious and uncertain as well as angry. He was a prophet and a
      skeptic. "So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the
      city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he
      might see what would become of the city. And the Lord God prepared a
      gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over
      his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of
      the gourd. But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and
      it smote the gourd that it withered. And it came to pass, when the sun did
      arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the
      head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It
      is better for me to die than to live. And God said to Jonah, Doest thou
      well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even
      unto death. Then said the Lord, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the
      which thou hast not labored, neither madest it grow; which came up in a
      night, and perished in a night: And should not I spare Nineveh, that great
      city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that can not discern
      between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?" The
      Lord seems to have overlooked that Jonah had more pity on himself than the
      gourd, whose only value to him was as a shade from the sun. Jonah, too,
      might have reminded the Lord that there were more than 120,000 persons
      similarly situated at the deluge and at the slaughter of the Midianites,
      and that the "much cattle" had never theretofore been reckoned in the
      divine decrees of mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here ends the new life of Jonah. Of the prophet's childhood we know
      nothing; of his middle age no more than we have here related; of his old
      age and death we have nothing to say. It is enough for good Christians to
      know that "Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so
      shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the
      earth." According to Jesus the story of Jonah is as true as Gospel.

      WHO WAS JESUS CHRIST?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Many persons will consider the question heading this pamphlet as one to
      which the Gospels have given a sufficient answer, and that no further
      inquiry is necessary. We, in reply, point out that while the general
      Christian body affirm that Jesus was God incarnate on earth, the Unitarian
      Christians, less in numerical strength, but numbering a large proportion
      of the more intelligent and humane, absolutely deny this divinity; and
      even in the earliest ages of the Christian Church heretics were found who
      scrupled not to deny that Jesus had ever existed in the flesh. Under these
      circumstances, it is well to prosecute the inquiry to the uttermost, that
      our faith may rest on sure foundations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of Jesus Christ is contained in four books, or gospels. We
      know not with any degree of certainty, and have now no means of knowing,
      when these gospels were written, we know not where they were written, and
      we know not by whom they were written. Until after the year A. D. 200, no
      author, except Irenæus, professes to mention any gospels by Matthew, Mark,
      Luke, or John, and there is no sufficient evidence to identify the gospels
      we have with the writings to which Irenseus refers. The Church has,
      however, kindly provided us with an author for each gospel, and the early
      Fathers have proved there ought to be four gospels, because there are four
      seasons, four principal points to the compass, etc. Our duty is simply to
      believe. With regard to the gospel first in order, it is true that divines
      themselves disagree as to the language in which it was written. Some
      allege that the original was in Hebrew, others deny that our Greek version
      has any of the characters of a translation. This increases our difficulty,
      but if we wish for temporal welfare we must believe with the party which
      is most fashionable, and if we simply wish for truth, we had better
      disregard all parties and avoid their creeds. Our authorized English
      translation of the four gospels is made from the received Greek version;
      this version was made at Alcala in Spain, and the MSS. from which it was
      obtained were afterward sold by the pious Christians and manufactured into
      sky-rockets by one Torjo, a firework maker. So that the same Christians
      who threaten us with the pains of hell if we reject the gospels, actually
      condemned their own books to brimstone and fire. The only variation in the
      mode of burning is this&mdash;the holy MSS., when made into sky-rockets,
      were shot upward and burnt in their ascent to the heavenly regions, and we
      are to burn in our descent into the lower regions of the bottomless pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not know the hour, the day, the month, or the year, in which Jesus
      was born. The only point on which divines generally agree is, that he was
      not born on Christmas Day. The Oxford chronology places the matter in no
      clearer light, and more than thirty learned authorities give us a period
      of over seven years difference in their reckoning. The place of his birth
      is also uncertain, as may be ascertained by careful reference to the text.
      For instance, the Jews in the very presence of Jesus reproached him that
      he ought to have been born at Bethlehem, and he never ventured to say, "I
      was born there." (John vii, 41, 42, 52.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Jesus was the son of David the son of Abraham (Matthew i), and his descent
      from Abraham is traced through Isaac, who was born of Sarai (whom the
      writer of the Epistle to Galatians, chap, iv, v. 24, says was a covenant
      and not a woman), and ultimately through Joseph, who was not only not his
      father, but is not shown to have had any relationship to Jesus at all, and
      through whom the genealogy should not be traced. There are two genealogies
      in the four gospels which have the merit of contradicting each other, and
      these in part may be collated with the Old Testament genealogy, which has
      the advantage of agreeing with neither. Much prayer and faith will be
      required in this introduction to the history of Jesus. The genealogy of
      Matthew possesses peculiar points of interest to a would-be believer. It
      is self-contradictory, counts thirteen names as fourteen without
      explanation, and omits the names of three kings without apology. Matthew
      (i, 13), says Abiud was the son of Zorobabel. Luke says Zorobabel's son
      was Rhesa. The Old Testament contradicts both, and gives Meshullam and
      Hananiah and Shelomith, their sister (1 Chron. iii, 19), as the names of
      Zorobabel's children. Some Greek MSS. insert "Joram" into Luke iii, 33. I
      do not know whether we shall be damned for omitting or for inserting
      Joram: those who believe had better look to this. Jesus was born without a
      father after his mother had been visited by the angel Gabriel, who "came
      in unto her" with a message from God. His reputed father, Joseph, had two
      fathers, one named Jacob, the other named Heli. The divines feeling this
      to be a difficulty, have kindly invented a statement that Heli was the
      father of Mary. The birth of Jesus was miraculously announced to Mary and
      to Joseph by visits of an angel, but they so little regarded the
      miraculous annunciation that they marveled soon after at things spoken by
      Simeon, which were much less wonderful in character. Jesus was the Son of
      God, or God manifest in the flesh, and his birth was first discovered by
      some wise men or astrologers. The God of the bible, who is a spirit, had
      previously said that these men were an abomination in his sight, and he
      therefore, doubtless, preferred them to be his first visitors in the flesh
      to keep up his character for incomprehensibility. These men saw <i>his</i>
      star in the East, but it did not tell them much, for they were obliged to
      come and ask information from Herod the king. Herod inquired of the chief
      priests and scribes; and it is evident Jeremiah was right, if he said,
      "The prophets prophecy falsely and the priests bear rule by their means,"
      for these chief priests, like the Brewin Grants and the Brindleys of the
      present day, misquoted to suit their purposes, and invented a false
      prophecy by omitting a few words from, and adding a few words to, a text
      until it suited their purpose. The star, after they knew where to go, and
      no longer required its aid, led the wise men and went before them, until
      it came and stood over where the young child was. The story will be better
      understood if the reader will walk out at night and notice some star, and
      then see how many houses it will be over. The writer of the third gospel
      does not appear to have been aware of the star story, and he therefore
      invents an angel who tells some shepherds; but as this last named
      adventure does not appear to have happened in the reign of Herod at all,
      perhaps Jesus was born twice. After the wise men had left Jesus, an angel
      warned Joseph to flee with him and Mary into Egypt, and Joseph did fly and
      remained there with the young child and his mother until the death of
      Herod; and this was done to fulfill a prophecy. On referring to Hosea (xi,
      1), we find the words have no reference whatever to Jesus, and that,
      therefore, either the tale of the flight is invented as a fulfillment of
      the prophecy, or the prophecy manufactured to support the tale of the
      flight. The Jesus of the third gospel never went into Egypt at all in his
      childhood; perhaps there were two Jesus Christs?
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jesus began to be about thirty years of age he was baptized by John
      in the river Jordan. John, who knew him, according to the writer of the
      first gospel, forbade him directly he saw him; but, according to the
      writer of the fourth gospel, he knew him not, and had, therefore, no
      occasion to forbid him. God is an "invisible" "spirit," whom no man hath
      seen (John i, 18), or can see. (Exodus xxxiii, 20); but John, who was a
      man, saw the spirit of God descending like a dove. God is everywhere, but
      at that time was in heaven, from whence he said, "This is my beloved Son,
      in whom I am well pleased." Although John heard this from God's own mouth,
      he did not always believe it, but sometime after sent two of his disciples
      to Jesus to inquire if he were really the Christ (Matthew xi, 2, 3).
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after the baptism, Jesus was led up of the spirit into the
      wilderness to be tempted of the devil. I do not know anything about either
      "the spirit" or "the devil" here mentioned, and the writer does not
      explain anything about them; he speaks of them familiarly, as old
      acquaintances. Jesus fasted forty days and forty nights, and in those days
      he did eat nothing. Of course it would be difficult to find a more severe
      fast&mdash;forty days and nights is a long period to abstain from food.
      Moses fasted twice that period. Such fasts take place in religious books,
      but they are seldom found in every-day life. Such fasts are nearly
      miraculous. Miraculous events are events which never happened in the past,
      do not take place in the present, and never will occur in the future.
      Jesus was God, and by his power as God fasted. This all must believe. The
      only difficulty is, to understand on the hypothesis of his divinity, what
      made him hungry. When Jesus was hungry the devil tempted him by offering
      him stones, and asking him to make them bread. We have heard of men having
      hard nuts to crack, but that stones should be offered to a hungry man for
      extempore bread-making hardly seems a probable temptation. Which
      temptation came next is a matter of doubt. The Holy Ghost, which the
      clergy assert inspired Matthew and Luke, does not appear to have inspired
      them both alike, and they relate the story of the temptation in different
      order. According to one, the devil next taketh Jesus to the pinnacle of
      the temple and tempts him to throw himself to the bottom, by quoting
      Scripture that angels should bear him in their arms. Jesus was, however,
      either a disbeliever in Scripture, or remembered that the devil, like
      other gentlemen in black, grossly misquoted to suit his purpose, and the
      temptation failed. The devil then took Jesus to an exceedingly high
      mountain, from whence he showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and
      the glory thereof, in a moment of time, which was very quick. It is urged
      that this did not include a view of the antipodes, but only referred to
      the kingdoms then known. If this be true, it must have been a long look
      from Judea to China, which was then a known kingdom. The eye of faith
      will, however, see things afar off and sometimes will also see things
      which are not. The mountain must have been very high&mdash;much higher
      than the diameter of the earth; it must have been solid in proportion,
      therefore would have capsized the earth in its revolutions, if even
      temporarily placed upon it. The devil then offered Jesus, who was the same
      as God, and therefore omnipotent, all the kingdoms of the world, if he,
      Jesus the omnipotent God, would fall down and worship his own creature,
      the devil. Some object that if God is the creator and omnipotent ruler of
      the world, then the devil would have no control over the kingdoms of the
      world, and that the offer could be no temptation as it was made to Jesus,
      who was both God omnipotent and all-wise, as well as man. These objectors
      may easily be answered by asserting that it requires a proper submission
      of the intellect, and an abhorrence of worldly reason, in order properly
      to understand these books. After this Jesus taught the multitudes. His
      teachings will form the subject of a separate tract. We are here only
      endeavoring to answer our preliminary question by a narration of his
      history.

    <p>
      After the temptation, Jesus is alleged to have worked many miracles,
      casting out devils, and otherwise creating marvels among the inhabitants
      of Judea. Bedevilment is now at a sad discount, and if a second Jesus of
      Nazareth were in this heretical age to boast that he possessed the power
      of casting out devils, he would stand a fair chance of expiating his
      offense by a three months' penance with hard labor in the highly polished
      interior of some borough jail. Now if men be sick and they have a little
      wisdom, the physician is resorted to, who administers medicine to cure the
      disease. If men have much wisdom they study physiology, while they have
      health, in order to prevent sickness altogether. In the time of the early
      Christians prayer and faith (James v, 14, 15) occupied the position of
      utility since usurped by rhubarb, jalap, <i>et similibus</i>. Men who had
      lost their sight in the time of Christ were attacked not by disease but by
      the devil; we have heard of men seeing double who have allowed spirits to
      get into their heads. In the days of Jesus one spirit would make a man
      blind, or deaf, or dumb; occasionally a number of devils would get into a
      man and drive him mad. We do not doubt this, nor do we ask our readers to
      doubt. We are grieved to be obliged to add that although we do not doubt
      the story of devils, neither do we believe them. Our state of mind is
      neither that of doubt, nor of absolute conviction of their correctness. On
      one occasion, Jesus met either one man (Mark v, 2) or two men (Matthew
      viii, 28) possessed with devils. I am not in a position to advance greater
      reasons for believing that it was one man who was possessed than for
      believing there were two in the clutches of the devils. The probabilities
      are equal&mdash;that is, the amount of probability is not greater upon the
      one side than upon the other&mdash;that is, there is no probability on
      either side. The devils knew Jesus and addressed him by name. Jesus was
      not so familiar with the imp, or imps, and we find inquired the name of
      the particular devil he was addressing. The answer given in Latin would
      induce a belief that the devils usually spoke in that tongue. This may be
      an error, but, of course, it is well to give consideration to every
      particular when we know we are to be eternally damned if we happen to
      believe the wrong statement. Jesus wanted to cast out the devils, this
      they do not seem to have cared about, but they appear to have had a
      decided objection to being cast out of the country. Whether Palestine was
      the native country of the devils, and that therefore they were loth to
      quit it, I know not, but it is likely enough, as Christianity is alleged
      to have had its rise there. A compromise was agreed to, and at their own
      request the devils were transferred to a herd of swine. People who believe
      this may be said to "go the whole hog." The Jesus of the four gospels is
      also alleged to have fed large multitudes of people under circumstances of
      a most ultra-thaumaturgic character. To the first book of Euclid is,
      prefixed an axiom that "the whole is greater than its part." John Wesley
      is alleged to have eschewed mathematics lest it should lead him to
      Infidelity. John Wesley was wise, for if any man be foolish enough to
      accept Euclid's axiom, he will be compelled to reject the miraculous
      feeding of 5,000 people with five loaves and two small fishes. It is
      difficult under any circumstances to perform a miracle. The original
      difficulty is rather increased than diminished by the assertion that after
      the multitude had been fed, twelve baskets full of fragments remained.
      Perhaps the loaves were very large or the baskets very small.
    </p>

      Jesus is related to have walked on the sea at a time when it was very
      stormy, and when, to use the words of the text, "the sea arose by reason
      of a great wind that blew." Walking on the water is a great feat if it be
      calm, but when the waves run high it is still more wonderful. Perhaps it
      was because Jesus must have been often engulfed by the angry waves, that
      one sect prefers baptism by complete immersion. We admire this miracle; we
      know how difficult it is for a man to keep his head above water in the
      affairs of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The miracle of turning water into wine at Cana, in Galilee, is worthy of
      considerable attention, in the endeavor to answer the question, Who was
      Jesus Christ? Jesus and his disciples had been called to a marriage feast,
      and when there the company fell short of wine. The mother of Jesus to whom
      the Catholics offer worship, and pay great adoration, informed Jesus of
      the deficiency. Jesus, who was very meek and gentle, answered her in the
      somewhat uncourteous and unmeaning phrase, "Woman, what have I to do with
      thee? mine hour is not yet come." His mother seemed to have expected a
      miracle by her conduct, yet if the fourth gospel speak the truth, that was
      the beginning of miracle working on the part of Jesus. Perhaps something
      had previously happened which is not recorded, and which would explain
      this apparent inconsistency. We must exert our faith to fill up any little
      gap which may be in the way of salvation. Jesus having obtained six
      waterpots full of water, turned them into wine. Teetotalers who reject
      spirits in bottles, but accept spiritual teachings, and who can not
      believe God would specially provide means of drunkenness, urge that this
      wine was not of intoxicating quality. We will hope their hypothesis is a
      correct one, but there is nothing to justify it in our text. In fact, the
      curious connection between the phrase "well drunk" and the time at which
      the miracle was performed, would almost warrant the allegation that the
      guests were already in such a state as to render unnecessary the
      administration of further intoxicants. The moral effects of this miracle
      are not easily conceivable by carnal minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after this Jesus went to the temple, and in a meek and quiet
      manner, with a scourge of small curds drove thereout the cattle dealers
      and money changers who had assembled there in the ordinary course of their
      business. It is hardly probable that the Jews would have permitted this
      without violent resistance to so rough a course of procedure. The writer
      of the fourth gospel placed this event very early in the public life of
      Jesus. The writer of the third gospel fixes the occurrence much later.
      Perhaps it happened twice, or perhaps they have both made a mistake in the
      time.

      The Jesus of the four gospels is alleged to have been God all-wise; being
      hungry, he went to a fig-tree, when the season of figs was not yet come.
      Of course there were no figs upon the tree, and Jesus then caused the tree
      to wither away. This is an interesting account to a true orthodox
      trinitarian. Such a one will believe: first, that Jesus was God, who made
      the tree, and prevented it from bearing figs; second, that God the
      all-wise, who is not subject to human passions, being hungry, went to the
      fig-tree, on which he knew there would be no figs, expecting to find some
      there; third, that God the all-just then punished the tree because it did
      not bear figs in opposition to God's eternal ordination. This account is a
      profound mystery to a truly religious man. He bow's his head, flings his
      carnal reason away, and looks at the matter in a prayerful spirit, with an
      eye of faith. Faith as a grain of mustard seed will remove a mountain. The
      only difficulty is to get the grain of faith; all is easy when that is
      done. The "eye of faith" is a great help, it sometimes enables men to see
      that which does not exist. Jesus had a disciple named Peter, who, having
      much faith, was a great rascal and denied his leader in his hour of need.
      Jesus was previously aware that Peter would be a rascal, and he gave him
      the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and told him that whatsoever be bound
      on earth should be bound in heaven. Many an honest man has been immured in
      a dungeon, and has had the key turned on him by a rascally jailor. It is
      to be regretted that the like should be promised for all eternity. Peter
      was to have denied Jesus three times before the cock should crow (Matt.
      26, 34). The cock was doubtless an infidel cock, and would not wait. He
      crowed before Peter's second denial (Mark xiv, 68).
    </p>
    <p>
      Commentators urge that the words used do not refer to the crowing of any
      particular cock, but to a special hour of the morning called "cockcrow."
      The commentators have but one difficulty to get over, and that is, that if
      the gospel be true, their explanation is false.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter's denial becomes the more extraordinary when we remember that he had
      seen Moses, Jesus, and Elias talking together, and had heard a voice from
      a cloud say, "This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased." If Peter
      could thus deny Jesus after having heard God vouch his divinity, and if
      Peter not only escapes punishment but gets the office of gatekeeper to
      heaven, how much should we escape punishment and obtain reward, who only
      deny because we can not help it, and who have no corroborative evidence of
      sight or hearing to compel our faith?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jesus of the first gospel promised that, as Jonas was three days and
      three nights in the whale's belly, so he (Jesus) would be three days and
      three nights in the heart of the earth. Yet he was buried on Friday
      evening, and was out of the grave before Saturday was over. Of course this
      is susceptible of explanation; you must have faith and believe that in
      some other language something else was said which ought to be translated
      differently. Or, if you can not believe thus, then you must have faith
      until you stretch the one day and part of another day, and one night and
      part of another night, into three days and three nights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our orthodox translators have made Jesus perform a curious equestrian feat
      on his entry into Jerusalem. The text says, they "brought the ass and the
      colt and put on them their clothes and set him thereon." Perhaps this does
      not mean that he rode on both at one time.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the cross, the Jesus of the four gospels, who was God, cried out, "My
      God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" God can not forsake himself.
      Jesus was God himself. Yet God forsook Jesus, and the latter cried out to
      know why he was forsaken. This is one of the mysteries of the holy
      Christian religion which, "unless a man rightly believe without doubt he
      shall perish everlastingly."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the crucifixion of Jesus wonderful miracles took place. "The graves
      were opened, and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out
      of the grave after his resurrection and appeared unto many." We do not
      know which saints these were. Whether they numbered among them St.
      Abraham, who permitted his wife to incur the risk of dishonor, and who
      accepted riches to gild his shame; who turned his wife into the desert
      with one bottle of water and some bread. Saint Lot, of whom the less said
      the purer our pages; Saint Judah, who wanted to burn alive a woman he had
      gotten with child; Saint Jacob, the liar and cheat; Saint Joseph, the
      model prime minister, who bought the people's rights with their own corn;
      Saint Moses, the conjuror, who killed 3,000 Jews because his own brother
      Aaron had persuaded them to make a golden calf; Saint Jael, the blessed
      above all women, because she drove most treacherously a nail into the
      skull of a sleeping guest; Saint Samson, who slew one thousand men with
      the jawbone of an ass; Saint Gideon, who frightened a large body of
      Midianites, with trumpets, pitchers, and lanterns. Poor Midianites, they
      had all been exterminated long before Gideon's time; it must have been an
      extraordinary providence to bring them into life in order to frighten
      them; but God's ways are not as our ways. This is a digression&mdash;in
      plain language, we do not know who "the saints" were. They "appeared unto
      many," but there is not the slightest evidence that any one ever saw them.
      Their "bodies" came out of the graves, so we suppose that the bodies of
      the saints do not decompose like those of ordinary human beings. As the
      saints rose, so did Jesus. As they had their bodies, so had he. He must
      have much changed in the grave, for his disciples did not know him when he
      stood on the shore (John xxi, 4).
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the first gospel Jesus appeared to two women after his
      resurrection, and afterward met eleven of his disciples by appointment on
      a mountain in Galilee. We do not know when the appointment was made; the
      only verse on which divines rely as being capable of bearing this
      construction is Matt, xxxi, 32, and that voice is silent both as to place
      and time&mdash;in fact, gives no promise of any meeting whatever.
      According to the second gospel, he appeared first to one women, and when
      she told the disciples they did not believe it. Yet we are bound to
      unhesitatingly accept that which the disciples of Jesus rejected. We have
      an advantage which perhaps the disciples lacked. We have several different
      stories of the same event, and we can select that which appears to us the
      most probable. The disciples might have been so unfortunate as to have
      only one account. By the second gospel we learn that instead of the eleven
      going to Galilee after Jesus, he came to them as they sat at meat. In the
      third gospel, wo are told that he first appeared to two of his disciples
      at Emmaus, and they did not know him until they had been a long time in
      his company&mdash;in fact, according to the text, it was evening before
      they recognized him, so we suppose the light of faith supplied the want of
      the light of day. Unfortunately directly they saw him they did not see
      him, for as soon as they knew him he vanished out of their sight. He
      immediately afterward appeared to the eleven at Jerusalem, and not at
      Galilee, as stated in the first Gospel. Jesus asked for some meat, and the
      disciples gave him a portion of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb, and he
      did eat. In these degenerate days it is hard to believe in a ghost eating
      fried fish, yet we must try to do it for our soul's sake, which otherwise
      may be burned for ever in the fire that is never quenched. There is
      certainly nothing more improbable in God the Son eating broiled fish after
      he was dead, than there is in believing God the Father ate dressed calf,
      tender and good, prepared for him by Abraham (<i>vide</i> Genesis xviii).
      A truly pious and devout mind will not look at the letter which killeth,
      but for the spirit which maketh alive. Jesus was afterward taken up into
      heaven, a cloud received him, and he was missed. God of course is
      everywhere, and heaven is not more above than below, but it is necessary
      we should believe that Jesus has ascended into heaven to sit on the right
      hand of God, who is infinite and has no right hand. Our question at the
      commencement was, "Who was Jesus Christ?" Was he a man?&mdash;surely not.
      Born without a father, in the lifetime of Herod, according to Luke.
      Residing in Egypt, according to Matthew, at a period in which, if Luke be
      true, he never could have visited Egypt at all. His whole career is, not
      simply a series of improbabilities, not simply a series of absurdities,
      but, in truth, a series of fables destitute of foundation in fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who was Christ? born of a virgin. So was Chrishna, the Hindoo god
      incarnate. The story of Chrishna is identical in many respects with that
      of Jesus. The story of Chrishna was current long prior to the birth of
      Jesus. The story of Chrishna is believed by the inhabitants of Hindostan
      and disbelieved by the English, who say it is a myth, a fable. We add that
      both are equally true, and that both are equally false.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who was Jesus Christ? A man or a myth? His history being a fable, is the
      hero a reality? Do you allege that it was impossible to forge books so
      large as the gospels? then the answer is that Christians were skilled in
      the art of forging epistles, gospels, acts, decrees of councils, etc. Will
      you urge that this only applies to the Romish Church? Then you will admit
      that your stream runs from a polluted fountain? Who was Jesus Christ? Who
      was Saint Patrick, who excelled the reptiles from Ireland? Who was Fin ma
      coul? Who was Odin? Perhaps there was a man who really lived and performed
      some special actions attracting popular attention, but beyond this Jesus
      Christ is a fiction.

      WHAT DID JESUS TEACH?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The doctrines of Jesus may be sought for and found in a small compass.
      Four thin gospels are alleged to contain nearly the entirety of his
      sayings, and as most Englishmen are professedly Christians, it might be
      fairly supposed that the general public were conversant with Christ's
      teachings. This, however, is not the case. The bulk of professors believe
      from custom rather than from reading. They profess a faith as they follow
      a fashion&mdash;because others have done so before them. What did Jesus
      teach? Manly self-reliant resistance of wrong, and practice of right? No;
      the key-stone of his whole teaching may be found in the text, "Blessed are
      the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Matthew v, 3.
</pre>
    <p>
      Is poverty of spirit the chief among virtues, that Jesus gives it the
      prime place in his teaching? Is poverty of spirit a virtue at all? Surely
      not. Manliness of spirit, honesty of spirit, fullness of rightful purpose,
      these are virtues; but poverty of spirit is a crime. When men are poor in
      spirit, then do the proud and haughty in spirit oppress and trample upon
      them, but when men are true in spirit and determined (as true men should
      be) to resist and prevent evil, wrong, and injustice whenever they can,
      then is their greater opportunity for happiness here, and no lesser
      fitness for the enjoyment of further happiness, in some may-be heaven,
      hereafter. Are you poor in spirit, and are you smitten; in such case what
      did Jesus teach? "Unto whom that smiteth thee on the one cheek, offer also
      the other."* 'Twere better far to teach that "he who courts oppression
      shares the crime." Rather say, if smitten once, take careful measure to
      prevent a future smiting. I have heard men preach passive resistance, but
      this teaches actual invitation of injury, a course degrading in the
      extreme.
    </p>

      Shelley breathed higher humanity in his noble advice:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Stand ye calm and resolute,
     Like a forest close and mute,

</pre>
    <p>
      There is a wide distinction between the passive resistance to wrong and
      the courting of further injury at the hands of the wrongdoer. I have in no
      case seen this better illustrated than in Mr. George Jacob Holyoake's
      history of his imprisonment in Gloucester Jail,** where passive resistance
      saved him from the indignity of a prison dress, and also from compulsory
      attendance at morning prayer in the prison chapel, which in his case would
      have been to him an additional insult. But the teaching of Jesus goes much
      beyond this kind of conduct; the poverty of spirit principle is enforced
      to the fullest extent&mdash;"Him that taketh away thy cloak, forbid not to
      take thy coat also. Give to every man that asketh of thee, and from him
      that taketh away thy goods, ask them not again."*** Poverty of person is
      the only possible sequence to this extraordinary manifestation of poverty
      of spirit.

      Poverty of person is attended with many unpleasantnesses; and if Jesus
      knew that poverty of goods would result from his teaching, we might expect
      some notice of this. And so there is&mdash;as if he wished to keep the
      poor content through their lives with poverty, he says, "Blessed be ye
      poor for yours is the kingdom of God."* "But woe unto you that are rich,
      for you have received your consolation."** He pictures one in hell, whose
      only related vice is that in life he was rich; and another in heaven,
      whose only related virtue is that in life he was poor.*** He at another
      time tells his hearers that it is as difficult for a rich man to get into
      heaven as for a camel to go through the eye of a needle.**** The only
      intent of such teaching could be to induce the poor to remain content with
      the want and misery attendant on their wretched state in this life, in the
      hope of a higher recompense in some future life. Is it good to be content
      with poverty? Nay, 'tis better far to investigate the cause of such
      poverty, with a view to its cure and prevention. The doctrine is a most
      horrid one which declares that the poor shall not cease from the face of
      the earth. Poor in spirit and poor in pocket. With no courage to work for
      food, or money to purchase it! We might well expect to find the man who
      held these doctrines with empty stomach also; and what does Jesus teach?&mdash;"Blessed
      are ye that hunger now, for ye shall be filled."***** He does not say when
      the filling shall take place, but the date is evidently postponed until
      the time when you will have no stomachs to replenish. It is not in this
      life that the hunger is to be sated. Do you doubt me, turn again to your
      Testament and read, "Woe unto you that are full, for ye shall
      hunger."****** This must surely settle the point.

      It would be but little vantage to the hungry man to bless him by filling

      had awaited the completion of his repast. Craven in spirit, with an empty
      purse and hungry mouth&mdash;what next? The man who has not manliness
      enough to prevent wrong will probably bemoan his hard fate, and cry
      bitterly that so sore are the misfortunes he endures. And what does Jesus
      teach?&mdash;"Blessed are ye that weep now, for ye shall laugh."* Is this
      true, and if true, when? "Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be
      comforted."** Aye, but when? Not while they mourn and weep. Weeping for
      the past is vain; 'tis past, and a deluge of tears will never wash away
      its history. Weeping for the present is worse than vain&mdash;it obstructs
      your sight. In each minute of your life the aforetime future is
      present-born, and you need dry and keen eyes to give it and yourself a
      safe and happy deliverance. When shall they that mourn be comforted? Are
      slaves that weep salt teardrops on their steel shackles comforted in their
      weeping? Nay, but each pearly overflow, as it falls, rusts mind as well as

      treason, not to yourself alone, but to your fellows. These three, like

      What did Jesus teach? "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."* So far
      well, but how if thy neighbor will not hear thy doctrine when thou
      preacheth the "glad tidings of great joy" to him? Then forgetting all thy
      love, and with bitter hatred that a theological disputant alone can
      manifest, thou "shalt shake off the dust from your feet," and by so doing
      make it more tolerable in the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and
      Gomorrah than for your unfortunate neighbor who has ventured to maintain
      an opinion of his own, and who will not let you be his priest.** It is,
      indeed, a mockery to speak of love, as if love to one another could result
      from the dehumanizing and isolating faith required from the disciple of
      Jesus. Ignatius Loyola in this, at least, was more consistent than his
      Protestant brethren,*** "If any man come unto me, and hate not his father,
      and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and
      his own life also, he can not be my disciple."**** "Think not that I am
      come to send peace on earth. I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I
      am come to set men at variance against his father, and the daughter
      against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law, and
      a man's foes they shall be of his own household.*****" "Every one that
      hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father or mother, or
      wife or children, or lands for my sake, shall receive an hundred fold, and
      shall inherit everlasting life."****** The teaching of Jesus is, in fact,
      save yourself by yourself. The teaching of humanity should be, to save
      yourself save your fellow.

      The human family is a vast chain, each man and woman a link. There is no
      snapping off one link and preserving for it an entirety of happiness; our
      joy depends on our brother's also. But what does Jesus teach? That "many
      are called, but few are chosen;" that the majority will inherit an
      eternity of misery, while it is but the minority who obtain eternal
      happiness. And on what is the eternity of bliss to depend? On a truthful
      course of life? Not so. Jesus puts Father Abraham in Heaven, whose
      reputation for faith outstrips his character for veracity. The passport
      througli Heaven's portals is faith. "He that believeth and baptized shall
      be saved, and he that believeth not, shall be damned."* Are you married?
      Have you a wife you love? She dies and you. You from your first speech to
      your last had ever said, "I believe," much as a clever parrot might say
      it, if well taught. You had never examined your reasons for your faith
      for, like a true believer should, you distrusted the efficacy of your
      carnal reason. You said, therefore, "I believe in God and Jesus Christ,"
      because you had been taught to say it, and you would have as glibly said,
      "I believe in Allah, and in Mahomet his prophet," had your birthplace been
      a few degrees more eastward, and your parents and instructors Turks. You
      believed in this life and awake in Heaven. Your much-loved wife did not
      think as you did&mdash;she could not. Her organization, education and
      temperament were all different from your own. She disbelieved because she
      could not believe. She was a good wife, but she disbelieved, A good and
      affectionate mother, but she disbelieved. A virtuous and kindly woman, but
      she disbelieved. And you are to be happy for an eternity in Heaven, while
      she is writhing in agony in Hell.

      It is often urged that Jesus is the Savior of the world, that he brought
      redemption without let or stint to the whole human race. But what did
      Jesus teach? "Go not into any way of the Gentiles, and into any city of
      the Samaritan enter ye not."* These were his injunctions to those whom he
      first sent out to preach. "I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the
      house of Israel," is his hard answer to the poor Syrophenician woman who
      is entreating succor for her child. Christianity, as first taught by
      Jesus, was for the Jews alone, and it is only upon his rejection by them
      that the world at large has the opportunity of salvation afforded it. "He
      came unto his own and his own received him not,"** Why should the Jews be
      more God's own than the Gentiles? Is God the creator of all? and did he
      create the descendant of Abraham with greater right and privilege than all
      other men? Then, indeed, is great and grievous injustice done. You and I
      had no choice whether we would be born Jews or Gentiles; yet to the
      accident of such a birth is attached the first offer of a salvation which
      if accepted, shuts out all beside. The Kingdom of Heaven is a prominent
      feature in the teachings of Jesus, and it may be well to ascertain, as
      precisely as we can, the picture drawn by God incarnate of his own special
      domain. 'Tis likened to a wedding feast, to which the invited guests
      coming not, servants are sent out into the highways to gather all they can
      find&mdash;both good and bad. The King comes in to see his motley array of
      guests, and findeth one without a wedding garment.

<pre xml:space="preserve">

    <p>
      The King inquired why he came into the feast without one, and the man,
      whoso attendance has been compulsorily enforced, is speechless. And who
      can wonder? he is a guest from necessity, not choice, he neither chose the
      fashion of his coming or his attiring. Then comes the King's decree, the
      command of the all-merciful and loving King of Heaven: "Bind him hand and
      foot, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and
      gnashing of teeth." Commentators urge that it was the custom to provide
      wedding garments for all guests, and that this man is punished for his
      nonacceptance of the customary and ready robe. The text does not warrant
      this position, but assigns, as an explanation of the parable, that an
      invitation to the heavenly feast will not insure its partakal, for that
      many are called, but few are chosen. What more of the Kingdom of Heaven?
      "There shall be joy in Heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than
      over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance."* Nay, it is
      urged that the greater sinner one has been, the better saint he makes, and
      the more he has sinned, so much the more he loves God. "To whom little is
      forgiven, the same loveth little."** Is not this indeed asserting that a
      life of vice, with its stains washed away by a death-bed repentance, is
      better than a life of consistent and virtuous conduct? Why should the
      fatted calf be killed for the prodigal son?*** Why should men be taught to
      make to themselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness?
    </p>
    <p>
      These ambiguities, these assertions of punishment and forgiveness of
      crime, instead of directions for its prevention and cure, are serious
      detractions from a system alleged to have been inculcated by one for whom
      his followers claim divinity.

      Will you again turn back to the love of Jesus as the redeeming feature of
      the whole? Then, I ask you, read the story of the fig-tree* withered by
      the hungry Jesus. The fig-tree, if he were all-powerful God, was made by
      him, he limited its growth and regulated its development. He prevented it
      from bearing figs, expected fruit where he had rendered fruit impossible,
      and in his <i>infinite love</i> was angry that the tree had not upon it
      that which it could not have. Tell me the love expressed in that
      remarkable speech which follows one of his parables, and in which he says:
      "For, I say unto you, that unto every one which hath shall be given, and
      from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away from
      him. But those, mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over
      them, bring them hither, and slay them before me."** What love is
      expressed by that Jesus who, if he were God, represents himself as saying
      to the majority of his unfortunate creatures (for it is the few who are
      chosen): 'Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for
      the devil and his angels.'***

      In reading the sayings attributed to Jesus, all must be struck by the
      passage which so extraordinarily influenced the famous Origen.* If he
      understood it aright, its teachings are most terrible. If he understood it
      wrongly, what are we to say for the wisdom of teaching which expresses so
      vaguely the meaning which it rather hides than discovers by its words? The
      general intent of Christ's teaching seems to be an inculcation of neglect
      of this life, in the search for another. "Labor not for the meat which
      perisheth, but for that meat which en-dureth unto everlasting life."**
      "Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink;
      nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on.... take no thought, saying,
      what shall we eat? or what shall we drink? or wherewithal shall we be
      clothed?.... But seek ye first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness,
      and all these things shall be added unto you." The effect of these texts,
      if fully carried out, would be most disastrous; they would stay all
      scientific discoveries, prevent all development of man's energies. It is
      in the struggle for existence here that men are compelled to become
      acquainted with the conditions which compel happiness or misery. It is
      only by the practical application of that knowledge, that the wants of
      society are understood and satisfied, and disease, poverty, hunger, and
      wretchedness, prevented. Jesus substitutes "I believe," for "I think," and
      puts "watch and pray," instead of "think and act." Belief is made the most
      prominent feature, and is, indeed, the doctrine which pervades, permeates,
      and governs all Christianity. It is represented that, at the judgment, the
      world will be reproved "Of sin because they believe not." This teaching is
      most disastrous; man should be incited to active thought: belief is a cord
      which would bind him to the teachings of an uneducated past.

      Thought, mighty thought, mighty in making men most manly, will burst this
      now rotting cord, and then&mdash;shaking off the cobwebbed and
      dust-covered traditions of dark old times, humanity shall stand crowned
      with a most glorious diadem of facts, which, like gems worn on a bright
      summer's day, shall grow more resplendent as they reflect back the rays of
      truth's meridian sun. Fit companion to blind belief in slave-like prayer.
      Men pray as though God needed most abject entreaty ere he would grant them
      justice. What does Jesus teach on this? What is his direction on prayer?
      "After this manner pray ye: Our Father, which art in heaven." Do you think
      that God is the Father of all, when you pray that he will enable you to
      defeat some other of his children, with whom your nation is at war? And
      why "which art in Heaven?" Where is Heaven? you look upward, and if you
      were at the antipodes, would look upward still. But that upward would be
      downward to us. Do you know where Heaven is, if not, why say "which art in
      Heaven?" Is God infinite, then he is in earth also, why limit him to
      Heaven? "Hallowed be thy name." What is God's name? and if you know it
      not, how can you hallow it? How can God's name be hallowed even if you
      know it? "Thy kingdom come." What is God's kingdom, and will your praying
      bring it quicker? Is it the Judgment day, and do you say "Love one
      another," pray for the more speedy arrival of that day on which God may
      say to your fellow, "depart ye cursed into everlasting fire?" "Thy will be
      done on earth, as it is in heaven." How is God's will done in heaven? If
      the devil be a fallen angel, there must have been rebellion even there.
      "Give us this day our daily bread," Will the prayer get it without work?
      No. Will work get it without the prayer? Yes? Why pray then for bread to
      God, who says, "Blessed be ye that hunger.... woe unto you that are full?"
      "And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors." What debts have you
      to God? Sins? Samuel Taylor Coleridge says, "A sin is an evil which has
      its ground or origin in the agent, and not in the compulsion of
      circumstances. Circumstances are compulsory, from the absence of a power
      to resist or control them: and if the absence likewise be the effect of
      circumstances.... the evil derives from the circumstances.... and such
      evil is not sin."* Do you say that you are independent of all
      circumstances, that you can control them, that you have a free will? Mr.
      Buckle says that the assertion of a free will "involves two assumptions,
      of which the first, though possibly true, has never been proved, and the
      second is unquestionably false. These assumptions are that there is an
      independent faculty, called consciousness, and that the dictates of that
      faculty are infallible."** "And lead us not into temptation, but deliver
      us from evil." Do you think God will possibly lead you into temptation? if
      so, you can not think him all-good, if not all-good he is not God, if God,
      the prayer is a blasphemy.

      I close this paper with the last scene in Jesus' life, not meaning that I
      have&mdash;in these few pages&mdash;fully examined his teachings; but
      hoping that enough is even here done to provoke inquiry and necessitate
      debate, Jesus, according to the general declaration of Christian divines,
      came to die, and what does he teach by his death? The Rev. F. D. Maurice
      it is, I think, who well says, "That he who kills for a faith must be
      weak, that he who dies for a faith must be strong." How did Jesus die?
      Giordano Bruno, and Julius Caesar Vanini, were burned for Atheism. They
      died calm, heroic defiant of wrong. Jesus, who could not die, courted
      death, that he, as God, might accept his own atonement, and might pardon
      man for a sin which he had not committed, and in which he had no share.
      The death he courted came, and when it came he could not face it, but
      prayed to himself that he might not die. And then, when on the cross, if
      two of the gospels do him no injustice, his last words&mdash;as there
      recorded&mdash;were a bitter cry of deep despair, "My God, my God, why
      hast thou forsaken me?" The Rev. Enoch Mellor, in his work on the
      Atonement, says, "I seek not to fathom the profound mystery of these
      words. To understand their full import would require one to experience the
      agony of desertion they express." Do the words, "My God, my God, why hast
      thou forsaken me?" express an "agony" caused by a consciousness of
      "desertion?" Doubtless they do; in fact, if this be not the meaning
      conveyed by the despairing death-cry, then there is in it no meaning
      whatever. And if those words do express a "bitter agony of desertion,"
      then they emphatically contradict the teachings of Jesus. "Before Abraham
      was, I am." "I and my father are one." "Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy
      God." These were the words of Jesus, words conveying (together with many
      other such texts) to the reader an impression that divinity was claimed by
      the man who uttered them. If Jesus had indeed been God, the words "My God,
      my God," would have been a mockery most extreme. God could not have deemed
      himself forsaken by himself. The dying Jesus, in that cry, confessed
      himself either the dupe of some other teaching, a self-deluded enthusiast,
      or an arch-imposter, who, in the bitter cry, with the wide-opening of the
      flood-gates through which life's stream ran out, confessed aloud that he,
      at least, was no deity, and deemed himself a God-forsaken man. The garden
      scene of agony is fitting prelude to this most terrible act. Jesus, who is
      God, prays to himself, in "agony he prayed most earnestly."* He refuses to
      hear his own prayers, and he, the omnipotent, is forearmed against his
      coming trial by an angel from heaven, who "strengthened" the great
      Creator. Was Jesus the son of God? Praying, he said, "Father, the hour is
      come, glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee."** And was he
      glorified? His death and resurrection most strongly disbelieved in the
      very city where they happened, if, indeed, they ever happened at all. His
      doctrines rejected by the only people to whom he preached them. His
      miracles denied by the only nation where they are alleged to have been
      performed; and he himself thus on the cross, crying out, "My God, my God,
      why hast thou forsaken me?" Surely no further comment is needed on this
      head, to point more distinctly to the most monstrous mockery the text
      reveals.

      THE TWELVE APOSTLES.
    </h2>
    <p>
      All, good Christians, indeed all Christians&mdash;for are there any who
      are not models of goodness?&mdash;will desire that their fellow-creatures
      who are unbelievers should have the fullest possible information,
      biographical or otherwise, as to the twelve persons specially chosen by
      Jesus to be his immediate followers. It is not for the instruction of the
      believer that I pen this brief essay; he would be equally content with his
      faith in the absence of all historic vouchers. Indeed a pious worshiper
      would cling to his creed not only without testimony in its favor, but
      despite direct testimony against it. It is to those not within the pale of
      the church that I shall seek to demonstrate the credibility of the history
      of the twelve apostles. The short biographical sketch here presented is
      extracted from the first five books of the New Testament, two of which at
      least are attributed to two of the twelve. It is objected by heretical men
      who go as far in their criticisms on the Gospels as Colenso does with the
      Pentateuch, that not one of the gospels is original or written by any of
      the apostles; that, on the contrary, they were preceded by numerous
      writings, since lost or rejected, these in their turn having for their
      basis the oral tradition which preceded them. It is alleged that the four
      gospels are utterly anonymous, and that the fourth gospel is subject to
      strong suspicions of spuriousness. It would be useless to combat, and I
      therefore boldly ignore these attacks on the authenticity of the text, and
      proceed with my history. The names of the twelve are as follows: Simon,
      surnamed Peter; Andrew, his brother; James and John, the sons of Zebedee;
      Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; James, the son of Alphaeus; Simon,
      the Canaanite; Judas Iscariot; and a twelfth, as to whose name there is
      some uncertainty; it was either Lebbaeus, Thaddaeus, or Judas. It is in
      Matthew alone (x, 3) that the name of Lebbaeus is mentioned thus:
      "Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus." We are told, on this point, by
      able biblicists, that the early MSS. have not the words "whose surname was
      Thaddaeus," and that these words have probably been inserted to reconcile
      the gospel according to Matthew with that attributed to Mark. How good
      must have been the old fathers who sought to improve upon the Holy Ghost
      by making clear that which inspiration had left doubtful! In the English
      version of the Rheims Testament used in this country by our Roman Catholic
      brethren, the reconciliation between Matthew and Mark is completed by
      omitting the words "Lebbaeus whose surname was," leaving only the name
      "Thaddaeus" in Matthew's text. This omission must be correct, being by the
      authority of an infallible church. If Matthew x, 3, and Mark iii, 18, be
      passed as reconciled, although the first calls the twelfth disciple
      Lebbaeus, and the second gives him the name Thaddaeus, there is yet the
      difficulty that in Luke vi, 16, corroborated by John xiv, 22, there is a
      disciple spoken of as "Judas, not Iscariot." "Judas, the brother of
      James." Commentators have endeavored to clear away this last difficulty by
      declaring that Thaddaeus is a Syriac word, having much the same meaning as
      Judas. This has been answered by the objection that if Matthew's Gospel
      uses Thaddæus in lieu of Judas, then he ought to speak of Thaddaeus
      Iscariot, which he does not; and it is further objected also that while
      there are some grounds for suggesting a Hebrew original for the gospel
      attributed to Matthew, there is not the slightest pretense for alleging
      that Matthew wrote in Syriac. It is to be hoped that the unbelieving
      reader will not stumble on the threshold of his study because of a little
      uncertainty as to a name. What is in a name? The Jewish name which we read
      as Jesus is really Joshua, but the name to which we are most accustomed
      seems the one we should adhere to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simon Peter being the first named among the disciples of Jesus, deserves
      the first place in this notice. The word "Simon" may be rendered, if taken
      as a Greek name, <i>flatnose</i> or <i>ugly</i>. Some of the ancient Greek
      and Hebrew names are characteristic of peculiarities in the individual,
      but no one knows whether Peter's nose had anything to do with his name.
      Simon is rather a Hebrew name, but Peter is Greek, signifying a <i>rock</i>
      or <i>stone</i>. Peter is supposed to have the keys of the kingdom of
      heaven, and his second name may express his stony insensibility to all
      appeals by infidels for admittance to the celestial regions. Lord Byron's
      "Vision of Judgment" is the highest known authority as to Saint Peter's
      celestial duties, but this nobleman's poems are only fit for very pious
      readers. Peter, ere he became a parson, was by trade a fisher, and when
      Jesus first saw Peter, the latter was in a vessel fishing with his brother
      Andrew, casting a net into the sea of Galilee, Jesus walking by the sea
      said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."* The two
      brothers did so, and they became Christ's disciples. The successors of
      Peter have since reversed the apostles' early practice: instead of now
      casting their nets into the sea, the modern representatives of the
      disciples of Jesus draw the sees into their nets, and, it is believed,
      find the result much more profitable. When Jesus called Peter no one was
      with him but his brother Andrew; a little further on, the two sons of
      Zebedee were in a ship with their father mending nets. This is the account
      of Peter's call given in the gospel according to Matthew, and as Matthew
      was inspired by the Holy Ghost, who is identical with God the Father, who
      is one with God the Son, who is Jesus, the account is doubtless free from
      error. In the Gospel according to John, which is likewise inspired in the
      same manner, from the same source, and with similar infallibility, we
      learn that Andrew was originally a disciple of John the Baptist, and that
      when Andrew first saw Jesus, Peter was not present, but Andrew went and
      found Peter who, if fishing, must have been angling on land, telling him
      "we have found the Messiah," and that Andrew then brought Peter to Jesus,
      who said, "Thou art Simon, the son of Jonas; thou shalt be called Cephas."
      There is no mention in this gospel narrative of the sons of Zebedee being
      a little further on, or of any fishing in the sea of Galilee. This call is
      clearly on land, whether or not near the sea of Galilee does not appear.
      In the Gospel according to Luke, which is as much inspired as either of
      the two before-mentioned gospels, and, therefore equally authentic with
      each of them, we are told** that when the call took place, Jesus and Peter
      were both at sea. Jesus had been preaching to the people, who, pressing
      upon him, he got into Simon's ship, from which he preached.

      After this he directed Simon to put out into the deep and let down the
      nets. Simon answered, "Master, we have toiled all night and taken nothing;
      nevertheless, at thy word I will let down the net." No sooner was this
      done than the net was filled to breaking, and Simon's partners, the two
      sons of Zebedee, came to help, when, at the call of Jesus, they brought
      their ships to land, and followed him. From these accounts the unbeliever
      may learn that when Jesus called Peter, either both Jesus and Peter were
      on the land, or one was on land and the other on sea, or both of them were
      at sea. He may also learn that the sons of Zebedee were present at the
      time, having come to help to get in the great catch, and were called with
      Peter; or that they were further on, sitting mending nets with their
      father, and were called afterward; or that they were neither present nor
      near at hand. He may also be assured that Simon was in his ship when Jesus
      came to call him, and that Jesus was on land when Andrew, Simon's brother,
      found Simon and brought him to Jesus to be called. The unbeliever must not
      hesitate because of any apparent incoherence or contradiction in the
      narrative. With faith it is easy to harmonize the three narratives above
      quoted, especially when you know that Jesus had visited Simon's house
      before the call of Simon,* but did not go to Simon's house until after
      Simon had been called.** Jesus went to Simon's house and cured his wife's
      mother of a fever. Robert Taylor,*** commenting on the fever-curing
      miracle, says: "St. Luke tells us that this fever had taken the woman, not
      that the woman had taken the fever, and not that the fever was a very bad
      fever, or a yellow fever, or a scarlet fever, but that it was a great
      fever&mdash;that is, I suppose, a fever six feet high at least; a personal
      fever, a rational and intelligent fever, that would yield to the power of
      Jesus' argument, but would never have given way to James' powder. So we
      are expressly told that Jesus rebuked the fever&mdash;that is, he gave it
      a good scolding; asked it, I dare say, how it could be so unreasonable as
      to plague the poor old woman so cruelly, and whether it wasn't ashamed of
      itself; and said, perhaps, <i>Get out you naughty, wicked fever, you</i>;
      and such like objurgatory language, which the fever, not used to being
      rebuked in such a manner, and being a very sensible sort of fever, would
      not stand, but immediately left the old woman in high dudgeon." This
      Robert Taylor, although a clergyman of the Church of England, has been
      convicted of blasphemy and imprisoned for writing in such wicked language
      about the bible. Simon Peter, as a disciple, performed many miracles, some
      when in company with Jesus, and more when separately by himself. These
      miracles, though themselves un-vouched by any reliable testimony, and
      disbelieved by the people among whom they worked, are strong evidence in
      favor of the apostolic character claimed for Peter.

      On one occasion the whole of the disciples were sent away by Jesus in a
      ship, the Savior remaining behind to pray. About the fourth watch of the
      night, when the ship was in the midst of the sea, Jesus went unto his
      disciples, walking on the sea. Though Jesus went unto his disciples, and
      as an expeditious way, I suppose, of arriving with them, he would have
      passed by them, but they saw him, and supposing him to be a spirit, cried
      out. Jesus bid them be of good cheer, to which Peter answered, "Lord, if
      it be thou, bid me come unto thee."* Jesus said, "Come," and Peter walked
      on the water to go to Jesus. But the sea being wet and the wind
      boisterous, Peter became afraid, and instead of walking on the water began
      to sink into it, and cried out "Lord save me," and immediately Jesus
      stretched out his hand and caught Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some object that the two gospels according to John and Mark, which both
      record the feat of water-walking by Jesus, omit all mention of Peter's
      attempt. Probably the Holy Ghost had good reasons for omitting it. A
      profane mind might make a jest of an Apostle "half seas over," and
      ridicule an apostolic gatekeeper who could not keep his head above water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter's partial failure in this instance should drive away all unbelief,
      as the text will show that it was only for lack of faith that Peter lost
      his buoyancy. Simon is called Bar-Jonah, that is, son of Jonah; but I am
      not aware if he is any relation to the Jonah who lived under water in the
      belly of a fish three days and three nights.

      It was Simon Peter who, having told Jesus he was the Son of God, was
      answered, "Blessed art thou Simon Bar-Jonah, flesh and blood hath not
      revealed it unto thee."** We find a number of disciples shortly before
      this, and in Peter's presence, telling Jesus that he was the Son of
      God,*** but there is no real contradiction between the two texts. It was
      on this occasion that Jesus said to Simon, "Thou art Peter, and upon this
      rock I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail
      against it, and I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of Heaven; and
      whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in Heaven, and
      whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in Heaven."

      Under these extraordinary declarations from the mouth of God the Son, the
      Bishops of Rome have claimed, as successors of Peter, the same privileges,
      and their pretensions have been, acceded to by some of the most powerful
      monarchs of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under this claim the Bishops, or Popes of Rome, have at various times
      issued Papal Bulls, by which they have sought to bind the entire world.
      Many of these have been very successful, but in 1302, Philip the Fair, of
      France, publicly burned the Pope Boniface's Bull after an address in which
      the States-General had denounced, in words more expressive than polite,
      the right of the Popes of Rome to Saint Peter's keys on earth. Some deny
      that the occupiers of the episcopal seat in the seven-hilled city are
      really of the Church of Christ, and they point to the bloody quarrels
      which have raged between men contending for the Papal dignity. They
      declare that those Vicars of Christ have more than once resorted to fraud,
      treachery, and murder, to secure the Papal dignity. They point to Stephen
      VII, the son of an unmarried priest, who cut off the head of his
      predecessor's corpse; to Sergius III, convicted of assassination; to John
      X, who was strangled in the bed of his paramour Theodora; to John XI, son
      of Pope Sergius III, famous only for his drunken debauchery; to John XII,
      found assassinated in the apartments of his mistress; to Benedict IX, who
      both purchased and sold the Pontificate; to Gregory VII, <i>pseudo</i>
      lover of the Countess Matilda, and the author of centuries of war carried
      on by his successors. And if these suffice not, they point to Alexander
      Borgia, whose name is but the echo of crime, and whose infamy will be as
      lasting as history.

      It is answered, "by the fruit ye shall judge of the tree." It is useless
      to deny the vine's existence because the grapes are sour. Peter, the
      favored disciple, it is declared was a rascal, and why not his successors?
      They have only to repent, and there is more joy in heaven over one sinner
      that repenteth, than over ninety and nine righteous men. Such language is
      very terrible, and arises from allowing the carnal reason too much

      All true believers will be familiar with the story of Peter's sudden

      unbelievers may be a little puzzled by the common infidel objections on

      refuted in the most orthodox fashion. It is objected that all the denials
      were to take place before the cock should crow,* but that only one denial
      actually took place before the cock crew.** That the first denial by Peter
      that he knew Jesus, or was one of his disciples, was at the door to the
      damsel,*** but was inside while sitting by the fire,**** that the second
      denial was to a man, and apparently still sitting by the fire,***** but
      was to a maid when he was gone out into the porch. That these denials, or,
      at any rate, the last denial, were all in the presence of Jesus,****** who
      turned and looked at Peter, but that the first denial was at the door,
      Jesus being inside the palace, the second denial out in the porch, Jesus
      being still inside,******* and the third denial also outside.

      The refutation of these paltry objections is simple, but as none but an

      Two of the twelve apostles, whose names are not, given, saw Jesus after he
      was dead, on the road to Emmaus, but they did not know him; toward evening
      they knew him, and he vanished out of their sight. In broad daylight they
      did not know him; at evening time they knew him. While they did not know
      him they could see him; when they did know him they could not see him.
      Well may true believers declare that the ways of the Lord are wonderful.
      One of the apostles, Thomas called Didymus, set the world an example of
      unbelief. He disbelieved the other disciples when they said to him "we
      have seen the Lord," and required to see Jesus, though dead, alive in the
      flesh, and touch the body of his crucified master. Thomas the apostle had
      his requirements complied with&mdash;he saw, he touched, and he believed.
      The great merit is to believe without any evidence&mdash; "He that
      believeth and is baptized, shall be saved, he that believeth not shall be
      damned." How it was that Thomas the Apostle did not know Jesus when he saw
      him shortly after near the sea of Tiberias, is another of the mysteries of
      the Holy Christian religion. The acts of the apostles after the death of
      Jesus deserve treatment in a separate paper; the present essay is issued
      in the meantime to aid the Bishop of London in his labors to stem the
      rising tide of infidelity.

      Adam's sin is the corner-stone of Christianity; the keystone of the arch.
      Without the fall there is no redeemer, for there is no fallen one to be
      redeemed. It is, then, to the history of Adam that the examinant of the
      atonement theory should first direct his attention. To try the doctrine of
      the atonement by the aid of science would be fatal to Christianity. As for
      the man, Adam, 6,000 years ago the first of the human race, his existence
      is not only unvouched for by science, but is actually questioned by the
      timid, and challenged by the bolder exponents of modern ethnology. The
      human race is traced back far beyond the period fixed for Adam's sin.
      Egypt and India speak for humanity busy with wars, cities and monuments,
      prior to the date given for the garden scene in Eden. The fall of Adam
      could not have brought sin upon mankind, and death by sin, if hosts of men
      and women had lived and died ages before the words "thou shalt surely die"
      were spoken by God to man. Nor could all men inherit Adam's misfortune, if
      it be true that it is not to one center, but to many centers of origin
      that we ought to trace back the various races of mankind. The theologian
      who finds no evidence of death prior to the offense shared by Adam and Eve
      is laughed to scorn by the geologist who point to the innumerable
      petrifactions on the earth's bosom, which with a million tongues declare
      more potently than loudest speech thai organic life in myriads of myriads
      was destroyed incalculable ages before man's era on our world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Science, however, has so little to offer in support of any religious
      doctrine, and so much to advance against all purely theologic tenets, that
      we turn to a point giving the Christian greater vantage ground; and,
      accepting for the moment his premises, we deny that he can maintain the
      possibility of Adam's sin, and yet consistently affirm the existence of an
      All-wise, All-powerful, and All-good God. Did Adam sin? We will take the
      Christian's bible in our hands to answer the question, first defining the
      word sin. What is sin? Samuel Taylor Coleridge says, "A sin is an evil
      which has its ground or origin in the agent, and not in the compulsion of
      circumstances...." An act to be sin must be original, and a state or act
      that has not its origin in the will may be calamity, deformity, or
      disease, but sin it can not be. It is not enough that the act appears
      voluntary, or that it has the most hateful passions or debasing appetite
      for its proximate cause and accompaniment. All these may be found in a
      madhouse, where neither law nor humanity permit us to condemn the actor of
      sin. The reason of law declared the maniac not a free agent, and the
      verdict follows, of course <i>Not guilty?</i> Did Adam sin?
    </p>
    <p>
      The bible story is that a Deity created one man and one woman; that he
      placed them in a garden wherein he had also placed a tree which was good
      for food, pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise.
      That although he had expressly given the fruit of every tree bearing seed
      for food, he, nevertheless, commanded them not to eat of the fruit of this
      attractive tree, under penalty of death. Supposing Adam to have at once
      disobeyed this injunction, would it have been sin? The fact that God had
      made the tree good for food, pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be
      desired to make one wise, would have surely been sufficient circumstance
      of justification on the God-created inducement to partake of its fruit.
      The inhibition lost its value as against the enticement. If the All-wise
      had intended the tree to be avoided, would he have made its allurements so
      overpowering to the senses? But the case does not rest here. In addition
      to all the attractions of the tree, and as though there were not enough,
      there is a subtle serpent, gifted with suasive speech, who, either wiser
      or more truthful than the All-perfect Deity, says that although God has
      threatened immediate death as the consequence of disobedience to his
      command, yet they "shall not die; for God doth know that in the day ye eat
      thereof your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good
      and evil." The tempter is stronger than the tempted, the witchery of the
      serpent is too great for the spellbound woman, the decoy tree is too
      potent in its temptations; overpersuaded herself by the honey-tongued
      voice of the seducer, she plucks the fruit and gives to her husband also.
      And for this their offspring are to suffer! The yet unborn children are to
      be the victims of God's vengeance on their parents' weakness&mdash;though
      he had made them weak; though, indeed, he had created the tempter
      sufficiently strong to practice upon this weakness, and had arranged the
      causes predisposing man and woman to commit the offense&mdash;if, indeed,
      it be an offense to pluck the fruit of a tree which gives knowledge to the
      eater. It is for this fall that Jesus is to atone. He is sacrificed to
      redeem the world's inhabitants from the penalties for a weakness (for sin
      it was not) they had no share in. It was not sin, for the man was
      influenced by circumstances pre-arranged by Deity, and which man was
      powerless to resist or control. But if man was so influenced by such
      circumstances, then it was God who influenced man&mdash;God who punished
      the human race for an action to the commission of which he impelled their
      progenitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam did not sin. He ate of the fruit of a tree which God had made good to
      be eaten. He was induced to this through the indirect persuasion of a
      serpent God had made purposely to persuade him. But even if Adam did sin,
      and even he and Eve, his wife, were the first parents of the whole human
      family, what have we to do with their sin? We, unborn when the act was
      committed and without choice as to coming into the world. Does Jesus atone
      for Adam's sin? Adam suffered for his own offense; he, according to the
      curse, was to eat in sorrow of the fruit of the earth all his life as
      punishment for his offense. Atonement, after punishment, is surely a
      superfluity. Did the sacrifice of Jesus serve as atonement for the whole
      world, and, if yes, for all sin, or for Adam's sin only? If the atonement
      is for the whole world, does it extend to unbelievers as well as to
      believers in the efficacy? If it only includes believers, then what has
      become of those generations who, according to the bible, for 4,000 years
      succeeded each other in the world without faith in Christ because without
      knowledge of his mission? Should not Jesus have come 4,000 years earlier,
      or, at least, should he not have come when the ark on Ararat served as
      monument of God's merciless vengeance, which had made the whole earth a
      battle-field, whereon the omnipotent had crushed the feeble, and had
      marked his prowess by the innumerable myriads of decayed dead? If it be
      declared that, though the atonement by Jesus only applies to believers in
      his mission so far as regards human beings born since his coming, yet that
      it is wider in its retrospective effect, then the answer is that it is
      unfair to those born after Jesus to make faith the condition precedent to
      the saving efficacy of atonement, especially if belief be required from
      all mankind posterior to the Christian era, whether they have heard of
      Jesus or not. Japanese, Chinese, savage Indians, Kaffirs, and others, have
      surely a right to complain of this atonement scheme, which insures them
      eternal damnation by making it requisite to believe in a Gospel of which
      they have no knowledge. If it be contended that belief shall only be
      required from those to whom the gospel of Jesus has been preached, and who
      have had afforded to them the opportunity of its acceptance, then how
      great a cause of complaint against Christian missionaries have those
      peoples who, without such missions, might have escaped damnation for
      unbelief. The gates of hell are opened to them by the earnest
      propagandist, who professes to show the road to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      But does this atonement serve only to redeem the human family from the
      curse inflicted by Deity in Eden's garden for Adam's sin, or does it
      operate as satisfaction for all sin? If the salvation is from the
      punishment for Adam's sin alone, and if belief and baptism are, as Jesus
      himself affirms, to be the sole conditions precedent to any saving
      efficacy in the much-lauded atonement by the Son of God, then what becomes
      of a child that only lives a few hours, is never baptized, and, never
      having any mind, consequently never has any belief? Or what becomes of one
      idiot born who, throughout his dreary life, never has mental capacity for
      the acceptance, or examination of, or credence in, any religious dogmas
      whatever? Is the idiot saved who can not believe? Is the infant saved that
      can not believe? I, with some mental faculties tolerably developed, can
      not believe. Must I be damned? If so, fortunate short-lived babe! lucky
      idiot! That the atonement should not be effective until the person to be
      saved has been baptized is at least worthy of comment; that the sprinkling
      a few drops of water should quench the flames of hell is a remarkable
      feature in the Christian's creed.

      How many fierce quarrels have raged on the formula of baptism among those
      loving brothers in Christ who believe he died for them! How strange an
      idea that, though God has been crucified to redeem mankind, it yet needs
      the font of water to wash away the lingering stain of Adam's crime.

      One minister of the Church of England, occupying the presidential chair of
      a well-known training college for church clergymen in the north of
      England, seriously declared, in the presence of a large auditory and of
      several church dignitaries, that the sin of Adam was so potent in its
      effect that if a man <i>had never been born, he would yet have been damned
      for sin!</i> That is, he declared that man existed before birth, and that
      he committed sin before he was born; and if never born, would,
      notwithstanding, deserve to suffer eternal torment for that sin!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is almost impossible to discuss seriously a doctrine so monstrously
      absurd, and yet it is not one whit more ridiculous than the ordinary
      orthodox and terrible doctrine that God, the undying, in his infinite
      love, killed himself under the form of his son to appease the cruel
      vengeance of God, the just and merciful, who, without this, would have
      been ever vengeful, unjust and merciless. The atonement theory, as
      presented to us by the bible, is in effect as follows: God creates man,
      surrounded by such circumstances as the divine mind chose, in the
      selection of which man had no voice, and the effects of which on man were
      all foreknown and predestined by Deity. The result is man's fall on the
      very first temptation, so frail the nature with which he was endowed, or
      so powerful the temptation to which he was subjected. For this fall not
      only does the All-merciful punish Adam, but also his posterity; and this
      punishment went on for many centuries, until God, the immutable, changed
      his purpose of continual condemnation of men for sins they had no share
      in, and was wearied with his long series of unjust judgments on those whom
      he created in order that he might judge them. That, then, God sent his
      son, who was himself and was also his own father, and who was immortal, to
      die upon the cross, and, by this sacrifice, to atone for the sin which God
      himself had caused Adam to commit, and thus to appease the merciless
      vengeance of the All-merciful, which would otherwise have been continued
      against men yet unborn for an offense they could not have been concerned
      in or accessory to. Whether those who had died before Christ's coming are
      redeemed the bible does not clearly tell us. Those born after are redeemed
      only on condition of their faith in the efficacy of the sacrifice offered,
      and in the truth of the history of Jesus's life. The doctrine of salvation
      by sacrifice of human life is the doctrine of a barbarous and superstitous
      age; the outgrowth of a brutal and depraved era. The God who accepts the
      bloody offering of an innocent victim in lieu of punishing the guilty
      culprit shows no mercy in sparing the offender: he has already satiated
      his lust for vengeance on the first object presented to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet sacrifice is an early and prominent, and, with slight exception, an
      abiding feature in the Hebrew record&mdash;sacrifice of life finds
      appreciative acceptance from the Jewish Deity. Cain's offering of fruits
      is ineffective but Abel's altar, bearing the firstlings of his flock, and
      the fat thereof, finds respect in the sight of the Lord. While the face of
      the earth was disfigured by the rotting dead, after God in his infinite
      mercy had deluged the world, then it was that the ascending smoke from
      Noah's burnt sacrifice of bird and beast produced pleasure in heaven, and
      God himself smelled a sweet savor from the roasted meats. To reach
      atonement for the past by sacrifice is worse than folly&mdash;it is crime.
      The past can never be recalled, and the only reference to it should be
      that, by marking its events, we may avoid its evil deeds and improve upon
      its good ones. For Jesus himself&mdash;can man believe in him? &mdash;in
      his history contained in anonymous pamphlets uncorroborated by
      contemporary testimony?&mdash;this history, in which, in order to fulfill
      a prophecy which does not relate to him, his descent from David is
      demonstrated by tracing through two self-contradictory genealogies the
      descent of Joseph who was not his father&mdash;this history, in which the
      infinite God grows, from babyhood and hus cradle through childhood to
      manhood, as though he were not God at all&mdash;this history, full of
      absurd wonders, devils, magicians, and evil spirits, rather fit for an
      Arabian Night's legend than the word of God to his people&mdash;this
      history, with its miraculous raisings of the dead to life, disbelieved and
      contradicted by the people among whom they are alleged to have been
      performed; but, nevertheless, to be accepted by us to-day with all
      humility&mdash;this history, with the Man-God subject to human passions
      and infirmities, who comes to die, and who prays to his heavenly father
      (that is, to himself) that he will spare him the bitter cup of death&mdash;who
      is betrayed, having himself, ere he laid the foundations of the world,
      predestined Judas to betray him, and who dies, being God immortal crying
      with his almost dying breath, "My God! my God! why hast thou forsaken me?"

    <h2>
      WERE ADAM AND EVE OUR FIRST PARENTS?
    </h2>
    <p>
      This question, Were Adam and Eve our first parents? is indeed one of most
      grave importance. If the answer be a negative one, it is, in fact, a
      denial of the whole scheme of Christianity. The Christian theory is that
      Adam, the common father of the whole human race, sinned, and that by his
      sin he dragged down all his posterity to a state from which redemption was
      needed; and that Jesus is, and was, the Redeemer, by whom all mankind are
      and were saved from the consequences of the fall of Adam. If Adam,
      therefore, be proved not to be the first man&mdash;if it be shown that it
      is not to Adam the various races of mankind are indebted for their origin,
      then the whole hypothesis of fall and redemption is dissipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a pamphlet like the present it is impossible to give any statement and
      analysis of the various hypotheses as to the origin of the human race. I
      frankly admit that my only wish and intent is, to compel people to examine
      the bible record for themselves, instead of making it their fetich, bowing
      down before it without thought. I am inclined to the opinion that the
      doctrine of a plurality of sources for the various types of the human race
      is a correct one; that wherever the conditions for life have been found,
      there also has been the degree of life resultant on those conditions. My
      purpose in this essay is not to demonstrate the correctness of my own
      thinking, but rather to illustrate the incorrectness of the Geneiacal
      teaching. Were Adam and Eve our first parents? On the one hand an answer
      in the affirmative to this question can be obtained from the bible, which
      asserts Adam and Eve to be the first man and woman made by God, and fixes
      the date of their making about 6,000 years, little more or less, from the
      present time. On the other hand, it seems to me that science emphatically
      declares man to have existed on the earth for a far more extended period;
      affirms that, as far as we can trace man, we find him in isolated groups,
      diverse in type, till we lose him in the ante-historic period; and, with
      nearly equal distinctness, denies that the various existing races find
      their common parentage in one pair. It is only on the first point that I
      attack the bible chronology of man's existence. I am aware that
      compilations based upon the authorized version of the Old Testament
      Scriptures are open to objection, and that while from the Hebrew 1,656
      years represent the period from Adam to the Deluge generally acknowledged,
      the Samaritan Pentateuch only yields for the same period 1,307 years,
      while the Septuagint version furnishes 2,242 years; there is, I am also
      informed, on the authority of a most erudite Egyptologist, a fatal
      objection to the Septuagint chronology&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, that it makes
      Methusaleh outlive the flood.*
    </p>
    <p>
      The deluge occurred, according to the Septuagint, in the year of the world
      2,242, and, by adding up the generations previous to Methusaleh's&mdash;

      The Rev. Dr. Lightfoot, who wrote about 1,644, fixes the month of the

      The book of Judges is not a book of history. Everything in it is recounted
      without chronological order. It will suffice to say, that the ciphers
      which we find in the book of Judges, and in the first book of Samuel,
      yield us, from the death of Joshua to the commencement of the reign of
      Saul, the sum total of 500 years, which would make, since the exode from
      Egypt, 565 years; whereas the first book of Kings counts but 480 years,
      from the going out of Egypt down to the foundation of the temple under
      Solomon. According to this we must suppose that several of the Judges
      governed simultaneously.*

      In reading Alfred Maury's profound essay on the classification of tongues,
      I was much struck with the fact that he, in his philological researches,
      traces back some of the ancient Greek mythologies to a Sanscrit source. He
      has the following remark, worthy of earnest attention: "The God of Heaven,
      or the sky, is called by the Greeks <i>Zeus Pater</i>; and let us here
      notice that the pronunciation of Z resembles very much that of D, inasmuch
      as the word Zeus becomes in the genitive <i>Dios</i>. The Latins termed
      the same God <i>Dies-piter</i>, or Jupiter Now in the Veda the God of
      Heaven is called Dyash-pitai." What is this but the original of our own
      Christian God, the father, the [&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;] (<i>Jeue</i>) pater
      of the Old Testament? I introduce this remark for the purpose of shaking a
      very commonly entertained opinion that the Hebrew Records, whether or not
      God-inspired, are at any rate the most antique, and are written in a
      primitive tongue. Neither is it true that Hebrew mythology is the most
      ancient, nor the Hebrew language the most primitive; on the contrary, the
      mythology is clearly derived, and the language in a secondary or tertiary
      state.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the value of this book of Genesis, which is the sole authority for
      the hypothesis that Adam and Eve, about 5,865 years ago, were the sole
      founders of the peoples now living on the face of the earth? Written we
      know not by whom, we know not when, and we know not in what language. If
      we respect the book, it must be from its internal merits; its author is to
      us unknown. Eusebius, Chrysostom, and Clemens Alexandrinus alike agree
      that the name of Moses should not stand at the head of Genesis as the
      author of the book. As to its internal merit Origen did not hesitate to
      declare the contents of the first and second chapters of Genesis to be
      purely figurative. Our translation of it has been severely criticised by
      the learned and pious Bellamy, and by the more learned and less pious Sir
      William Drummond. Errors almost innumerable have been pointed out, the
      correctness of the Hebrew text itself questioned, and yet this book is an
      unerring guide to the students of ethnology. They may do anything,
      everything, except stray out of the beaten track. We have, therefore, on
      the one hand, an anonymous book, which indeed does not take you back so
      much as 6,000 years, for at least 1,600 years must be deducted for the
      Noachian deluge, when the world's inhabitants were again reduced to one
      family, one race, one type. On the other hand, we have now existing Eskimo
      men, of the Arctic realm; Chinamen, of the Asiatic realm; Englishmen, of
      the European realm; Sahara negroes, of the African realm; Fuegians, of the
      American realm; New Zealanders, of the Polynesian realm; the Malay,
      representative of the realm which bears his name; the Tasmanian, of the
      Australian realm, with other families of each realm too numerous for
      mention here; dark and fair, black-skinned and white-skinned,
      woolly-haired and straight-haired; low forehead, high forehead; Hottentot
      limb, Negro limb, Caucasian limb. Do all these different and differing
      structures and colors trace their origin to one pair? To Adam and Eve, or
      rather to Noah and his family? Or are they (the various races) indigenous
      to their nature, soils, and climates? And are these various types
      naturally resultant, with all their differences, from the differing
      conditions for life persistent to and consistent with them?
    </p>
    <p>
      The question, then, really is this: Have the different races of men all
      found their common parent in Noah, about 4,300 years ago? Assuming the
      unity of the races or species of men now existing, there are but three
      suppositions on which the diversity now seen can be accounted for:
    </p>
    <p>
      "1. A miracle, or direct act of the Almighty, in changing one type into
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "2. The gradual action of physical causes, such as climate, food, mode of
      life, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      "3. Congenital or accidental varieties."*
    </p>
    <p>
      We may fairly dismiss entirely from our minds the question of miracle.
      Such a miracle is nowhere recorded in the bible, and it lies upon any one
      hardy enough to assert that the present diversity has a miraculous origin
      to show some kind of reasons for his faith, some kind of evidence for our
      conviction, and until this is done we have no reason to dwell on the first
      hypothesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the permanence of type under its own climatic conditions&mdash;that is,
      in the country to which it is indigenous&mdash;we have overwhelming proof
      in the statue of an ancient Egyptian scribe, taken from a tomb of the
      fifth dynasty, 5,000 years old, and precisely corresponding to the Fellah
      of the present day.**

      The sand had preserved the color of the statuette, which, from its
      portrait-like beauty, marks a long era of art-progress preceding its
      production. It antedates the orthodox era of the flood, carries us back to
      a time when, if the bible were true, Adam was yet alive, and still we find
      before it kings reigning and ruling in mighty Egypt. Can the reader wonder
      that these facts are held to impeach the orthodox faith?
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second point Dr. Nott writes: "It is a commonly received error that
      the influence of a hot climate is gradually exerted on successive
      generations, until one species of mankind is completely changed into
      another.... This idea is proven to be false.... A sunburnt cheek is never
      handed down to succeeding generations. The exposed parts of the body are
      alone tanned by the sun, and the children of the white-skinned Europeans
      in New Orleans, Mobile, and the West Indies are born as fair as their
      ancestors, and would remain so if carried back to a colder climate."*
    </p>
    <p>
      Pure negroes and negresses, transported from Central Africa to England,
      and marrying among themselves, would never acquire the characteristics of
      the Caucasian races; nor would pure Englishmen and Englishwomen,
      emigrating to Central Africa, and in like manner intermarrying, ever
      become negroes or negresses. The fact is, that while you don't bleach the
      color of the dark-skinned African by placing him in London, you bleach the
      life out of him; and <i>vice versa</i> with the Englishman.**
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * "Types of Mankind," p. 58.

     ** "Indigenous Races of the Earth," p. 458. The alleged
     discovery of white-skinned negroes in Western Africa does
     not affect this question: it is not only to the color of the
     skin, but also the general negro characteristics that the
     above remarks apply.
</pre>
    <p>
      For a long time there has been ascribed to man the faculty of adapting
      himself to every climate. The following facts will show the ascription a
      most erroneous one: "In Egypt the austral negroes are, and the Caucasian
      Memlooks were, unable to raise up even a third generation; in Corsica
      French families vanish beneath Italian summers. Where are the descendants
      of the Romans, the Vandals, or the Greeks in Africa? In Modern Arabia,
      1830 years after Mahomed Ali had got clear of the Morea war, 18,000
      Arnaots (Albanians) were soon reduced to some 400 men. At Gibraltar, in
      1817, a negro regiment was almost annihilated by consumption. In 1841,
      during the three weeks on the Niger, 130 Europeans out of 145 caught
      African fever, and 40 died; out of 158 negro sailors only eleven were
      affected, and not one died. In 1809 the British Expedition to Walchereen
      failed in the Netherlands through marsh fever. About the same time, in St.
      Domingo, about 15,000 French soldiers died from malaria. Of 30,000
      Frenchmen, only 8,000 survived exposure to that Antillian island; while
      the Dominicanized African negro, Tous-saint L'Overture, retransported to
      Europe, was perishing from the chill of his prison in France."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third point we again quote Dr. Nott: "The only argument left, then,
      is that of congenital varieties or peculiarities, which are said to spring
      up and be transmitted from parent to child, so as to form new races. Let
      us pause for a moment to illustrate this fanciful idea. The negroes of
      Africa, for example, are admitted not to be offsets from some other race
      which have been gradually blackened and changed in a moral and physical
      type by the action of climate, but it is asserted that 'once, in the
      flight of ages,' some genuine little negro, or rather many such, were born
      of Caucasian, Mongol, or other light-skinned parents, and then have turned
      about and changed the type of the inhabitants of a whole continent. So, in
      America, the countless aborigines found on this continent, which we have
      reason to believe were building mounds before the time of Abraham, are the
      offspring of a race changed by accidental or congenital varieties. Thus,
      too, old China, India, Australia, Oceana, etc., all owe their types,
      physical and mental, to congenital and accidental varieties, and are
      descended from Adam and Eve! Can human credulity go further, or human
      ingenuity invent any argument more absurd?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But even supposing these objections to the second and third suppositions
      set aside, there are two other propositions which, if affirmed, as I
      believe they may be, entirely overthrow the orthodox assertion "that Adam
      and Eve, six thousand years ago, were the first pair; and that all
      diversities now existing must find their common source in Noah&mdash;less
      than four thousand three hundred years from the present time." These two
      are as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. That man may be traced back on the earth long prior to the alleged
      Adamic era.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. That there are diversities traceable as existing among the human race
      four thousand five hundred years ago as marked as in the present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      To illustrate the position that man may be traced back to a period long
      prior to the Adamic era, we refer our readers to the chronology of the
      late Baron Bunsen, who, while allowing about 22,000 years for man's
      existence on earth, fixes the following dates, after a patient examination
      of the Nilotic antiquities:

      The assertion of such an antiquity for Egypt is no modern hypothesis.
      Plato puts language into the mouth of an Egyptian first claiming in that
      day an antecedent 10,000 years for painting and sculpture in Egypt. This
      has long been regarded as fabulous because it was contrary to the Hebrew
      chronology.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this be the result of the researches into Egyptian archæology, the
      reader will scarcely be surprised to find me endeavoring from other
      sources to get corroborative evidence of a still more astonishing
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are few who now pretend that the whole <i>creation (?)</i> took
      place 6,000 years ago, although if it be true that God made all in six
      days, and man on the sixth, then the universe would only be more ancient
      than Adam by some five days. To state the age of the earth at 6,000 years
      is simply preposterous, when we ascertain that it would require about
      4,000,000 of years for the formation of the fossiliferous rocks alone, and
      that 15,000,000 of years have been stated as a moderate estimate for the
      antiquity of our globe. The deltas of the great rivers afford
      corroboration to our position as to man's duration. The delta of the Nile,
      formed by immense quantities of sedimentary matter, which in like manner
      is still carried down and deposited, has not perceptibly increased during
      the last 3,000 years. "In the days of the earliest Pharaohs, the delta, as
      it now exists, was covered with ancient cities and filled with a dense
      population, whose civilization must have required a period going back far
      beyond any date that has yet been assigned to the deluge of Noah, or even
      to the creation of the world."*

      From borings which have been made at New Orleans to the depth of 600 feet,
      from excavations for public works, and from examinations in parts of
      Louisiana, where the range between high and low water is much greater than
      it is at New Orleans, no less than ten distinct cypress forests divided
      from each other by eras of aquatic plants, etc., have been traced,
      arranged vertically above each other; and from these and other data it is
      estimated by Dr. Benet Dowler that the age of the delta is at least
      158,000 years; and in the excavations above referred to human remains have
      been found below the further forest level, making it appear that the human
      race existed in the delta of the Mississippi more than 57,000 years ago.**
    </p>
    <p>
      It is further urged, by the same competent writer, that human bones
      discovered on the coast of Brazil near Santas, and on the borders of a
      lake called Lagoa Santa, by Captain Elliott and Dr. Lund, thoroughly
      incorporated with a very hard breccia, every one in a fossil state,
      demonstrate that aboriginal man in America antedates the Mississippi
      alluvia, and that he can even boast a geological antiquity, because
      numerous species of animals have become extinct since American humanity's
      first appearance.***

      With reference to the second point, as to the possibility of tracing back
      the diversities of the Human Race to an antediluvian date, it is simply
      sufficient to point on the one side to the remains of the American Indian
      disentombed from the Mississippi forests, and on the other to the Egyptian
      monuments, tombs, pyramids, and stuccoes, revealing to us Caucasian men,
      and Negro men, their diversities as marked as in the present day. Sir
      William Jones, in his day, claimed for Sanscrit literature a vast
      antiquity, and asserted the existence of the religions of Egypt, Greece,
      India, and Italy, prior to the Mosaic era. So far as Egypt is concerned
      the researches of Lepsius, Bunsen, Champollion, Lenormant, Gliddon, and
      others, have fully verified the position of the learned president of the
      Asiatic Society.

      us over the 4,500 years fixed by our second proposition. The fourth
      dynasty is rich in pyramids, tombs, and statues; and, according to
      Lepsius, this dynasty commenced 3,426 B. C, or about 5,287 years from the
      present date.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reading a modern work on the orthodox side,* I have been much pained by
      the constant assumption that the long chronologists must be in error,
      because their views do not coincide with orthodox teachings. Orthodox
      authors treat their heterodox brethren as unworthy of credit, because of
      their heterodoxy. The writer asserts** that the earliest reference to the
      Negro tribes is in the era of the 12th dynasty. Supposing for a moment
      this to be correct, I ask what even then will be the state of the
      argument? The 12th dynasty, according to Lepsius, ends about 4,000 years
      ago. The orthodox chronology fixes the deluge about 300 years earlier.
      Will any sane man argue that there was sufficient lapse of time in three
      centuries for the development of Caucasian and Negro man from one family?

      The fact is that we trace back the various types of man now known, not to
      one center, not to one country, not to one family, not to one pair, but we
      trace them to different centers, to distinct countries, to separate
      families, probably to many pairs. Wherever the conditions for life are
      found, there are living beings also. The conditions of climate, soil,
      etc., of Central Africa, differ from those of Europe. The indigenous races
      of Central Africa differ from those of Europe.

      Without pretending, in the present limited essay, to do more than index
      some of the most prominent features of the case, I yet hope that enough is
      here stated to interest my readers in the prosecution of future inquiry
      upon the important question which serves as the title to these pages. I
      put forward no knowledge from myself, but am ready to listen to the
      teachings of wiser men; and while I shrink from the ordinary orthodox
      assertion of Adamic unity of origin, accompanied as it is by threats of
      pains and penalties if rejected, I am yet ready to receive it, if it can
      be presented to me associated with facts, and divested of those future
      hell-fire torments and present societarian persecutions which now form its
      chief, if not sole, supports.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rejection of the bible account of the peopling of the world involves
      also the rejection, as has been already remarked, of the entire scheme of
      Christianity. According to the orthodox rendering of both New and Old
      Testament teaching, all men are involved in the curse which followed
      Adam's sin. But if the account of the Fall be mythical, not historical; if
      Adam and Eve&mdash;supposing them to have ever existed&mdash;were preceded
      on the earth by many nations and empires, what becomes of the doctrine
      that Jesus came to redeem mankind from a sin committed by one who was not
      the common father of all humanity?
    </p>
    <p>
      Reject Adam, and you can not accept Jesus. Refuse to believe Genesis, and
      you can not give credence to Matthew, Mark, Luke, John and Paul. The Old
      and New Testaments are so connected together that to dissolve the union is
      to destroy the system. The account of the Creation and Fall of Man is the
      foundation-stone of the Christian Church. If this stone be rotten, the
      superstructure can not be stable. It is therefore most important that
      those who profess a faith in Christianity should consider facts which so
      vitally and materially affect the creed they hold.

    <h2>
      A PLEA FOR ATHEISM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Gillespie says that "an Atheist propagandist seems a nondescript monster
      created by Nature in a moment of madness." Despite this opinion, it is as
      the propagandist of Atheism that I pen the following lines, in the hope
      that I may succeed in removing some few of the many prejudices which have
      been created against not only the actual holders of Atheistic opinions,
      but also against those wrongfully suspected of entertaining such ideas.
      Men who have been famous for depth of thought, for excellent wit, or great
      genius, have been recklessly assailed as Atheists by those who lacked the
      high qualifications against which the spleen of the calumniators was
      directed. Thus, not only has Voltaire been without ground accused of
      Atheism, but Bacon, Locke, and Bishop Berkeley himself, have, among
      others, been denounced by thoughtless or unscrupulous pietists as
      inclining to Atheism, the ground for the accusation being that they
      manifested an inclination to improve human thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is too often the fashion with persons of pious reputation to speak in
      unmeasured language of Atheism as favoring immorality, and of Atheists as
      men whose conduct is necessarily vicious, and who have adopted atheistic
      views as a disparate defiance against a Deity justly offended by the
      badness of their lives. Such persons urge that among the proximate causes
      of Atheism are vicious training, immoral and profligate companions,
      licentious living, and the like. Dr. John Pye Smith, in his "Instructions
      on Christian Theology," goes so far as to declare that "nearly all the
      Atheists upon record have been men of extremely debauched and vile
      conduct." Such language from the Christian advocate is not surprising, but
      there are others who, professing great desire for the spread of
      Freethought, and with pretensions to rank among acute and liberal
      thinkers, declare Atheism impracticable, and its teachings cold, barren,
      and negative. In this brief essay I shall except to each of the above
      allegations, and shall endeavor to demonstrate that Atheism affords
      greater possibility for human happiness than any system yet based on
      Theism, or possible to be founded thereon, and that the lives of true
      Atheists must be more virtuous, because more human, than those of the
      believers in Deity, the humanity of the devout believer often finding
      itself neutralized by a faith with which it is necessarily in constant
      collision. The devotee piling the faggots at the <i>auto de fe</i> of a
      heretic, and that heretic his son, might, notwithstanding, be a good
      father in every respect but this. Heresy, in the eyes of the believer, is
      highest criminality, and outweighs all claims of family or affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Atheism, properly understood, is in nowise a cold, barren negative; it is,
      on the contrary, a hearty, fruitful affirmation of all truth, and involves
      the positive assertion and action of highest humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let Atheism be fairly examined, and neither condemned&mdash;its defense
      unheard&mdash;on the <i>ex parte</i> slanders of the professional
      preachers of fashionable orthodoxy, whose courage is bold enough while the
      pulpit protects the sermon, but whose valor becomes tempered with
      discretion when a free platform is afforded and discussion claimed; nor
      misjudged because it has been the custom to regard Atheism as so unpopular
      as to render its advocacy impolitic. The best policy against all prejudice
      is to assert firmly the verity. The Atheist does not say "There is no
      God," but he says, "I know not what you mean by God: I am without idea of
      God; the word 'God' is to me a sound conveying no clear or distinct
      affirmation. I do not deny God, because I can not deny that of which I
      have no conception, and the conception of which by its affirmer is so
      imperfect that he is unable to define it to me." If you speak to the
      Atheist of God as a creator, he answers that the conception of creation is
      impossible. We are utterly unable to construe it in thought as possible
      that the complement of existence has been either increased or diminished,
      much less can we conceive an absolute origination of substance. We can not
      conceive either, on the one hand, nothing becoming something, or on the
      other, something becoming nothing. The Theist who speaks of God creating
      the universe, must either suppose that Deity evolved it out of himself, or
      that he produced it from nothing. But the Theist can not regard the
      universe as evolution of Deity, because this would identify Universe and
      Deity, and be Pantheism rather than Theism. There would be no distinction
      of substance&mdash;in fact, no creation. Nor can the Theist regard the
      universe as created out of nothing, because Deity is, according to him,
      necessarily eternal and infinite. His existence being eternal and
      infinite, precludes the possibility of the conception of vacuum to be
      filled by the universe if created. No one can even think of any point of
      existence in extent or duration and say here is the point of separation
      between the creator and the created. Indeed, it is not possible for the
      Theist to imagine a beginning to the universe. It is not possible to
      conceive either an absolute commencement, or an absolute termination of
      existence; that is, it is impossible to conceive a beginning before which
      you have a period when the universe has yet to be: or to conceive an end,
      after which the universe, having been, no longer exists. It is impossible
      in thought to originate or annihilate the universe. The Atheist affirms
      that he cognizes to-day effects, that these are at the same time causes
      and effects&mdash;causes to the effects they precede, effects to the
      causes they follow. Cause is simply everything without which the effect
      would not result, and with which it must result. Cause is the means to an
      end, consummating itself in that end. The Theist who argues for creation
      must assert a point of time, that is, of duration, when the created did
      not yet exist. At this point of time either something existed or nothing;
      but something must have existed, for out of nothing nothing can come.
      Something must have existed, because the point fixed upon is that of the
      duration of something. This something must have been either finite or
      infinite; if finite, it could not have been God; and if the something were
      infinite, then creation was impossible, as it is impossible to add to
      infinite existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you leave the question of creation and deal with the government of the
      universe, the difficulties of Theism are by no means lessened. The
      existence of evil is then a terrible stumbling-block to the Theist. Pain,
      misery, crime, poverty, confront the advocate of eternal goodness, and
      challenge with unanswerable potency his declaration of Deity as all-good,
      all-wise, and all-powerful. Evil is either caused by God, or exists
      independently; but it can not be caused by God, as in that case he would
      not be all-good; nor can it exist independently, as in that case he would
      not be all-powerful. Evil must either have had a beginning, or it must be
      eternal; but, according to the Theist, it can not be eternal, because God
      alone is eternal. Nor can it have had a beginning, for if it had it must
      either have originated in God, or outside of God; but, according to the
      Theist, it can not have originated in God, for he is all-good, and out of
      all-goodness evil can not originate; nor can evil have originated outside
      of God, for, according to the Theist, God is infinite, and it is
      impossible to go outside of or beyond infinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the Atheist this question of evil assumes an entirely different aspect.
      He declares that evil is a result, but not a result from God or Devil. He
      affirms that by conduct founded on knowledge of the laws of existence it
      is possible to ameliorate and avoid present evil, and, as our knowledge
      increases, to prevent its future recurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some declare that the belief in God is necessary as a check to crime. They
      allege that the Atheist may commit murder, lie, or steal, without fear of
      any consequences. To try the actual value of this argument, it is not
      unfair to ask, Do Theists ever steal? If yes, then in each such theft, the
      belief in God and his power to punish has been inefficient as a preventive
      of the crime. Do Theists ever lie or murder? If yes, the same remark has
      farther force&mdash;hell-fire failing against the lesser as against the
      greater crime. The fact is that these who use such an argument overlook a
      great truth&mdash;i.e., that all men seek happiness, though in very
      diverse fashions. Ignorant and miseducated men often mistake the true path
      to happiness, and commit crime in the endeavor to obtain it. Atheists hold
      that by teaching mankind the real road to human happiness, it is possible
      to keep them from the by-ways of criminality and error. Atheists would
      teach men to be moral now, not because God offers as an inducement reward
      by and by, but because in the virtuous act itself immediate good is
      insured to the doer and the circle surrounding him. Atheism would preserve
      man from lying, stealing, murdering now, not from fear of an eternal agony
      after death, but because these crimes make this life itself a course of
      misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Theism, asserting God as the creator and governor of the universe,
      hinders and checks man's efforts by declaring God's will to be the sole
      directing and controlling power, Atheism, by declaring all events to be in
      accordance with natural laws&mdash;that is, happening in certain
      ascertainable sequences&mdash;stimulates man to discover the best
      conditions of life, and offers him the most powerful inducements to
      morality. While the Theist provides future happiness for a scoundrel
      repentant on his death bed, Atheism affirms present and certain happiness
      for the man who does his best to live here so well as to have little cause
      for repenting hereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theism declares that God dispenses health and inflicts disease, and
      sickness and illness are regarded by the Theist as visitations from an
      angered Deity, to be borne with meekness and content. Atheism declares
      that physiological knowledge may preserve us from disease by preventing
      our infringing the law of health, and that sickness results not as the
      ordinance of offended Deity, but from ill-ventilated dwellings and
      workshops, bad and insufficient food, excessive toil, mental suffering,
      exposure to inclement weather, and the like&mdash;all these finding root
      in poverty, the chief source of crime and disease; that prayers and piety
      afford no protection against fever, and that if the human being be kept
      without food he will starve as quickly whether he be Theist or Atheist,
      theology being no substitute for bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Theist ventures to affirm that his God is an existence other than
      and separate from the so-called material universe, and when he invests
      this separate, hypothetical existence with the several attributes of
      omniscence, omnipresence, omnipotence, eternity, infinity, immutability,
      and perfect goodness, then the Atheist, in reply says, "I deny the
      existence of such a being."
    </p>
    <p>
      It becomes very important, in order that injustice may not be done to the
      Theistic argument, that we should have&mdash;in lieu of a clear
      definition, which it seems useless to ask for&mdash;the best possible clue
      to the meaning intended to be conveyed by the word God. If it were not
      that the word is an arbitrary term, invented for the ignorant, and the
      notions suggested by which are vague and entirely contingent upon
      individual fancies, such a clue could be probably most easily and
      satisfactorily obtained by tracing back the word "God," and ascertaining
      the sense in which it was used by the uneducated worshipers who have gone
      before us; collating this with the more modern Theism, qualified as it is
      by the superior knowledge of to-day. Dupuis says: "The word God appears
      intended to express the force universal, and eternally active, which
      endows all nature with motion according to the laws of a constant and
      admirable harmony; which develops itself in the diverse forms of organized
      matter, which mingles with all, gives life to all; which seems to be one
      through all its infinitely varied modifications, and inheres in itself
      alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the "Bon Sens" of Cure Meslier, it is asked, "Qu'est ce que Dieu?" and
      the answer is: "It is an abstract word coined to designate the hidden
      force of Nature, or rather it is a mathematical point having neither
      length, breadth, nor thickness."
    </p>
    <p>
      The orthodox fringe of the Theism of to-day is Hebraistic in its origion&mdash;that
      is, it finds its root in the superstition and ignorance of a petty and
      barbarous people nearly destitute of literature, poor in language, and
      almost entirely wanting in high conceptions of humanity. It might, as
      Judaism is the foundation of Christianity, be fairly expected that the
      ancient Jewish Records would aid us in our search after the meaning to be
      attached to the word "God." the most prominent words in Hebrew rendered
      God or Lord in English are [&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;] <i>Jeue</i>, and [&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;]
      <i>Aleim</i>. The first word, Jeue, called by our orthodox Jehovah, is
      equivalent to "that which exists," and indeed embodies in itself the only
      possible trinity in unity&mdash;i. e. past, present, and future. There is
      nothing in this Hebrew word to help you to any such definition as is
      required for the sustenance of modern Theism. The most you can make of it
      by any stretch of imagination is equivalent to the declaration "I am, I
      have been, I shall be." The word [&mdash;&mdash;] is hardly ever spoken by
      religious Jews, who actually in reading substitute for it, Adonai, an
      entirely different word. Dr. Wall notices the close resemblance in sound
      between the word <i>Yehowa</i> or <i>Yeue</i>, or Jehovah, and Jove. In
      fact [&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;], Jupiter and Jeue, pater, (God the
      father) present still closer resemblance in sound. Jove is also [&mdash;&mdash;]
      or [&mdash;&mdash;] or [&mdash;&mdash;], whence the word Deus and our
      Deity. The Greek mythology, far more ancient than that of the Hebrews, has
      probably found for Christianity many other and more important features of
      coincidence than that of a similarly sounding name. The word [&mdash;&mdash;]
      traced back affords us no help beyond that it identifies Deity with the
      universe. Plato says that the early Greeks thought that the only Gods were
      the sun, moon, earth, stars and heaven. The word Aleim, assists us still
      less in defining the word God, for Parkhurst translates it as a plural
      noun signifying "the curser," deriving it from the verb <i>to curse</i>.
      Finding that philology aids us but little, we must endeavor to arrive at
      the meaning of the word "God" by another rule. It is utterly impossible to
      fix the period of the rise of Theism among any particular people, but it
      is, notwithstanding, comparatively easy, if not to trace out the
      development of Theistic ideas, at any rate to point to their probable
      course of growth among all peoples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keightley, in his "Origin of Mythology," says: "Supposing, for the sake of
      hypothesis, a race of men in a state of total or partial ignorance of
      Deity, their belief in many gods may have thus commenced. They saw around
      them various changes brought about by human agency, and hence they knew
      the power of intelligence to produce effects. When they beheld other and
      greater effects, they ascribed them to some unseen being, similar but
      superior to man." They associated particular events with special unknown
      beings (gods), to each of whom they ascribed either a peculiarity of
      power, or a sphere of action not common to other gods. Thus one was god of
      the sea, anothor god of war, another god of love, another ruled the
      thunder and lightning; and thus through the various elements of the
      universe and passions of humankind, so far as they were then known.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mythology became modified with the advancement of human knowledge.
      The ability to think has proved itself oppugnant to and destructive of the
      desire to worship. Science has razed altar after altar heretofore erected
      to the unknown gods, and pulled down deity after deity from the pedestals
      on which ignorance and superstition had erected them. The priest who had
      formerly spoken as the oracle of God lost his sway, just in proportion as
      the scientific teacher succeeded in impressing mankind with a knowledge of
      the facts around them. The ignorant who had hitherto listened
      unquestioning during centuries of abject submission to their spiritual
      preceptors, at last commenced to search and examine for themselves, and
      were guided by experience rather than by church doctrine. To-day it is
      that advancing intellect which challenges the reserve guard of the old
      armies of superstition, and compels a conflict which humankind, must in
      the end have great gain by the forced enunciation of the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the word "God" the Theist derives no argument in his favor; it
      teaches nothing, defines nothing, demonstrates nothing, explains nothing.
      The Theist answers that this is no sufficient objection, that there are
      many words which are in common use to which the same objection applies.
      Even admitting that this were true, it does not answer the Atheist's
      objection. Alleging a difficulty on the one side is not a removal of the
      obstacle already pointed out on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Theist declares his God to be not only immutable, but also infinitely
      intelligent, and says: "Matter is either essentially intelligent, or
      essentially non-intelligent; if matter were essentially intelligent, no
      matter could be without intelligence; but matter can not be essentially
      intelligent, because some matter is not intelligent, therefore matter is
      essentially non-intelligent: but there is intelligence, therefore there
      must be a cause for the intelligence, independent of matter; this must be
      an intelligent being&mdash;i.e.., God." The Atheist answers, I do not know
      what is meant, in the mouth of the Atheist, by "matter." "Matter,"
      "substance," "existence," are three words having the same signification in
      the Atheist's vocabulary. It is not certain that the Theist expresses any
      very clear idea when he uses the words "matter" and "intelligence." Reason
      and understanding are sometimes treated as separate faculties, yet it is
      not unfair to presume that the Theist would include them both under the
      word intelligence. Perception is the foundation of the intellect. The
      perceptive faculty, or perceptive faculties, differs or differ in each
      animal, yet in speaking of matter that Theist uses the word "intelligence"
      as though the same meaning were to be understood in every case. The
      recollection of the perceptions is the exercise of a different faculty
      from the perceptive faculty, and occasionally varies disproportionately;
      thus an individual may have great perceptive faculties, and very little
      memory, or the reverse, yet memory, as well as perception, is included in
      intelligence. So also the faculty of comparing between two or more
      perceptions; the faculty of judging and the faculty of reflecting&mdash;all
      these are subject to the same remarks, and all these and other faculties
      are included in the word intelligence. We answer, then, that "God"
      (whatever that word may mean) can not be intelligent. He can never
      perceive; the act of perception results in the obtaining a new idea, but
      if God be omniscient his ideas have been eternally the same. He has either
      been always and always will be perceiving, or he has never perceived at
      all. But God can not have been always perceiving, because if he had he
      would always have been obtaining fresh knowledge, in which case he must
      have some time had less knowledge than now; that is he would have been
      less perfect; that is, he would not have been God: he can never recollect
      or forget, he can never compare, reflect nor judge. There can not be
      perfect intelligence without understanding; but following Coleridge,
      "understanding is the faculty of judging according to sense." The faculty
      of whom? Of some person, judging according to that person's senses? But
      has "God" senses? Is there anything beyond "God" for "God" to sensate?
      There can not be perfect intelligence without reason. By reason we mean
      that faculty or aggregation of faculties which avails itself of past
      experience to predetermine, more or less accurately, experience in the
      future, and to affirm truths which sense perceives, experiment verifies,
      and experience confirms. To God there can be neither past nor future,
      therefore to him reason is impossible. There can not be perfect
      intelligence without will, but has God will? If God wills, the will of the
      all-powerful must be irresistible; the will of the infinite must exclude
      all other wills.
    </p>
    <p>
      God can never perceive. Perception and sensation are identical. Every
      sensation is accompanied by pleasure or pain. But God, if immutable, can
      neither be pleased nor pained. Every fresh sensation involves a change in
      mental and perhaps in physical condition. God, if immutable, can not
      change. Sensation is the source of all ideas, but it is only objects
      external to the mind which can be sensated. If God be infinite there can
      be no objects external to him, and therefore sensation must be to him
      impossible. Yet without perception where is intelligence?

      God can not have memory or reason&mdash;memory is of the past, reason for
      the future, but to God immutable there can be no past, no future. The
      words past, present, and future, imply change; they assert progression of
      duration. If God be immutable, to him change is impossible. Can you have
      intelligence destitute of perception, memory, and reason? God can not have
      the faculty of judgment&mdash;judgment implies in the act of judging a
      conjoining or disjoining of two or more thoughts, but this involves change
      of mental condition. To God, the immutable, change is impossible. Can you
      have intelligence, yet no perception, no memory, no reason, no judgment?
      God can not think. The law of the thinkable is that the thing thought must
      be separated from the thing which is not thought. To think otherwise would
      be to think of nothing&mdash;to have an impression with no distinguishing
      mark, would be to have no impression. Yet this separation implies change,
      and to God, immutable, change is impossible. Can you have intelligence
      without thought? If the Theist replies to this that he does not mean by
      infinite intelligence as an attribute of Deity an infinity of the
      intelligence found in a finite degree of humankind, then he is bound to
      explain, clearly and distinctly, what other "intelligence" he means, and
      until this be done the foregoing statements require answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Atheist does not regard "substance" as either essentially intelligent
      or the reverse. Intelligence is the result of certain conditions of
      existence. Burnished steel is bright&mdash;that is, brightness is the
      necessity of a certain condition of existence. Alter the condition, and
      the characteristic of the condition no longer exists. The only essential
      of substance is its existence. Alter the wording of the Theist's
      objection. Matter is either essentially bright, or essentially non-bright.
      If matter were essentially bright, brightness should be the essence of all
      matter; but matter can not be essentially bright, because some matter is
      not bright, therefore matter is essentially non-bright; but there is
      brightness, therefore there must be a cause for this brightness
      independent of matter; that is, there must be an essentially bright being&mdash;i.e.,
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another Theistic proposition is thus stated: "Every effect must have a
      cause; the first cause universal must be eternal: <i>ergo</i>, the first
      cause universal must be God." This is equivalent to saying that "God" is
      "first cause." But what is to be understood by cause? Defined in the
      absolute, the word has no real value. "Cause," therefore, cannot be
      eternal. What can be understood by "first cause?" To us the two words
      convey no meaning greater than would be conveyed by the phrase "round
      triangle." Cause and effect are correlative terms&mdash;each cause is the
      effect of some precedent; each effect the cause of its consequent. It is
      impossible to conceive existence terminated by a primal or initial cause.
      The "beginning," as it is phrased, of the universe, is not thought out by
      the Theist, but conceded without thought. To adopt the language of
      Montaigne, "Men make themselves believe that they believe." The so-called
      belief in <i>Creation</i> is nothing more than the prostration of the
      intellect on the threshold of the unknown. We can only cognize the
      ever-succeeding phenomena of existence as a line in continuous and eternal
      evolution. This line has to us no beginning; we trace it back into the
      misty regions of the past but a little way; and however far we may be able
      to journey, there is still the great beyond Then what is meant by
      "universal cause?" Spinoza gives the following definition of cause, as
      used in its absolute signification: "By cause of itself I understand that,
      the essence of which involves existence, or that, the nature of which can
      only be considered as existent." That is, Spinoza treats "cause" absolute
      and "existence" as two words having the same meaning. If his mode of
      defining the word be contested, then it has no meaning other than its
      relative signification, of a means to an end. "Every effect must have a
      cause." Every effect implies the plurality of effects, and necessarily
      that each effect must be finite; but how is it possible from a finite
      effect to logically deduce a universal, i.e., infinite, cause?
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two modes of argument presented by Theists, and by which,
      separately or combined, they seek to demonstrate the being of a God. These
      are familiarly known as the arguments <i>a priori</i> and <i>a posteriori</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The a posteriori argument has been popularized in England by Paley, who
      has ably endeavored to bide the weakness of his demonstration under an
      abundance of irrelevant illustration. The reasoning of Paley is very
      deficient in the essential points where it most needed strength. It is
      utterly impossible to prove by it the eternity or infinity of Deity. As an
      argument founded on analogy, the design argument, at the best, could only
      entitle its propounder to infer the existence of a finite cause, or,
      rather, of a multitude of finite causes. It ought not to be forgotten that
      the illustrations of the eye, the watch, and the man, even if admitted as
      instances of design, or, rather, of adaptation, are instances of eyes,
      watches, and men, designed or adapted out of pre-existing substance, by a
      being of the same kind of substance, and afford, therefore, no
      demonstration in favor of a designer, alleged to have actually created
      substance out of nothing, and also alleged to have created a substance
      entirely different from himself. The <i>a posteriori</i> argument can
      never demonstrate infinity for Deity. Arguing from an effect finite in
      extent, the most it could afford would be a cause sufficient for that
      effect, such cause being possibly finite in extent and duration. And as
      the argument does not demonstrate God's infinity, neither can it, for the
      same reason, make out his omniscience, as it is clearly impossible to
      logically claim infinite wisdom for a God possibly only finite. God's
      omnipotence remains unproved for the same reason, and because it is
      clearly absurd to argue that God exercises power where he may not be. Nor
      can the <i>a posteriori</i> argument show God's absolute freedom, for, as
      it does nothing more than seek to prove a finite God, it is quite
      consistent with the argument that God's existence is limited and
      controlled in a thousand ways. Nor does this argument show that God always
      existed; at the best the proof is only that some cause, enough for the
      effect, existed before it, but there is no evidence that this cause
      differs from any other causes, which are often as transient as the effect
      itself. And as it does not demonstrate that God has always existed,
      neither does it demonstrate that he will always exist, or even that he now
      exists. It is perfectly in accordance with the arguement, and with the
      analagy of cause and effect that the effect may remain after the cause has
      ceased to exist. Nor does the argument from design demonstrate one God. It
      is quite consistent with this argument that a separate cause existed for
      each effect, or mark of design, discovered, or that several causes
      contributed to some or one of such effects. So that if the argument be
      true, it might result in a multitude of petty deities, limited in
      knowledge, extent, duration, and power; and, still worse, each one of this
      multitude of gods may have had a cause which would also be finite in
      extent and duration, and would require another, and so on, until the
      design argument loses the reasoner among an innumerable crowd of deities,
      none of whom can have the attributes claimed for God.
    </p>
    <p>
      The design argument is defective as an argument from analogy, because it
      seeks to prove a Creator God who designed, but does not explain whether
      this God has been eternally designing, which would be absurd; or, if he at
      some time commenced to design, what then induced him so to commence. It is
      illogical, for it seeks to prove an immutable Deity by demonstrating a
      mutation on the part of Deity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is unnecessary to deal specially with each of the many writers who have
      used from different standpoints the <i>a posteriori</i> form of argument
      in order to prove the existence of Deity. The objections already stated
      apply to the whole class; and, although probably each illustration used by
      the theistic advocate is capable of an elucidation entirely at variance
      with his argument, the main features of objection are the same. The
      argument <i>a posteriori</i> is a method of proof in which the premises
      are composed of some position of existing facts, and the conclusion
      asserts a position antecedent to those facts. The argument is from given
      effects to their causes. It is one form of this argument which asserts
      that man has a moral nature, and from this seeks to deduce the existence
      of a moral governor. This form has the disadvantage that its premises are
      illusory. In alleging a moral nature for man, the Theist overlooks the
      fact that the moral nature of man differs somewhat in each individual,
      differs considerably in each nation, and differs entirely in some peoples.
      It is dependent on organization and education: these are influenced by
      climate, food, and mode of life. If the argument from man's nature could
      demonstrate anything, it would prove a murdering God for the murderer, a
      lascivious God for the licentious man, a dishonest God for the thief, and
      so through the various phases of human inclination. The <i>a priori</i>
      arguments are methods of proof in which the matter of the premises exists
      in the order of conception antecedently to that of the conclusion. The
      argument is from cause to effect. Among the prominent Theistic advocates
      relying upon the <i>a priori</i> argument in England are Dr. Samuel
      Clarke, the Rev. Moses Lowman, and William Gillespie. As this last
      gentleman condemns his predecessors for having utterly failed to
      demonstrate God's existence, and as his own treatise on the "Necessary
      Existence of God" comes to us certified by the praise of Lord Brougham and
      the approval of Sir William Hamilton, it is to Mr. William Gillespie that
      the reader shall be directed.

    </p>
    <p>
      The first objection against the foregoing arguments is that it seeks to
      prove too much. It affirms one existence (God) infinite in extent and
      duration, and another entirely different and distinct existence (the
      material universe) finite in extent and duration. It therefore seeks to
      substantiate everything and something more. The first proposition is
      curiously worded, and the argument to demonstrate it is undoubtedly open
      to more than one objection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gillespie has not defined infinity, and it is possible therefore his
      argument may be misapprehended in this paper. Infinite signifies nothing
      more than indefinite. When a person speaks of infinite extension he can
      only mean to refer to the extension of something to which he has been
      unable to set limits. The mind can not conceive extension <i>per se</i>,
      either absolute or finite. It can only conceive something extended. It
      might be impossible mentally to define the extension of some substance. In
      such a case its extension would be indefinite; or, as Mr. Gillespie uses
      the word, infinite. No one can therefore possibly have any idea of
      infinity of extension. Yet it is upon the existence of such an idea, and
      on the impossibility of getting rid of it, that Mr. Gillespie grounds his
      first proposition. If the idea does not exist, the argument is destroyed
      at the first step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gillespie argues that it is utterly beyond the power of the human mind
      to conceive infinity of extension non-existent. He would have been more
      correct in asserting that it is utterly beyond the power of the human mind
      to conceive infinity of extension at all, either existent or non-existent.
      Extension can only be conceived as quality of substance. It is possible to
      conceive substance extended. It is impossible in thought to limit the
      possible extension of substance. Mr. Gillespie having asserted that we can
      not but believe that infinity of extension exists, proceeds to declare
      that it exists necessarily. For, he says, everything the existence of
      which we can not but believe, exists necessarily. It is not necessary at
      present to examine what Mr. Gillespie means by existing necessarily; it is
      sufficient to have shown that we do not believe in the existence of
      infinity of extension, although we may and do believe in the existence of
      substance, to the extension of which we may be unable to set limits. But,
      says Mr. Gillespie, "everything the existence of which we can not but
      believe is necessarily existing." Then as we can not but believe in the
      existence of the universe (or, to adopt Mr. Gillespie's phrase, the
      material universe), the material universe exists necessarily. If by
      "anything necessarily existing," he means anything the essence of which
      involves existence, or the nature of which can only be considered as
      existent, then Mr. Gillespie, by demonstrating the necessary existence of
      the universe, refutes his own later argument, that God is its creator. Mr.
      Gillespie's argument, as before remarked, is open to misconception,
      because he has left us without any definition of some of the most
      important words he uses. To avoid the same objection, it is necessary to
      state that by substance or existence I mean that which is in itself and is
      conceived per se&mdash;that is, the conception of which does not involve
      the conception of anything else as antecedent to it. By quality, that by
      which I cognize any mode of existence. By mode, each cognized condition of
      existence. Regarding extension as quality of mode of substance, and not as
      substance itself, it appears absurd to argue that the quality exists
      otherwise than as quality of mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of the propositions following the first are so built upon it,
      that if it fails they are baseless. The second proposition is, that
      infinity of extension is necessarily indivisible. In dealing with this
      proposition, Mr. Gillespie talks of the <i>parts</i> of infinity of
      extension, and winds up by saying that he means parts in the sense of
      partial consideration only. Now not only is it denied that you can have
      any idea of infinity of extension, but it is also denied that infinity can
      be the subject of partial consideration. Mr. Gillespie's whole proof of
      this proposition is intended to affirm that the parts of infinity of
      extension are necessarily indivisible from each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have already denied the possibility of conceiving infinity in parts;
      and, indeed, if it were possible to conceive infinity in parts, then that
      infinity could not be indivisible, for Mr. Gillespie says that, by
      indivisible, he means indivisible, either really or mentally. Now each
      part of anything conceived is, in the act of conceiving, mentally
      separated from, either other parts of, or from the remainder of, the whole
      of which it is part. It is clearly impossible to have a partial
      consideration of infinity, because the part considered must be mentally
      distinguished from the unconsidered remainder, and, in that case, you
      have, in thought, the part considered finite, and the residue certainly
      limited, at least, by the extent of the part under consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any of the foregoing objections are well-founded, they are fatal to Mr.
      Gillespie's argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      The argument in favor of the corollary to the second proposition is that
      the parts of infinity of extension are necessarily immovable among
      themselves; but if there be no such thing as infinity of extension&mdash;that
      is, if extension be only a quality and not necessarily infinite; if
      infinite mean only indefiniteness or illimitability, and if infinity can
      not have parts&mdash;this argument goes for very little. The acceptance of
      the argument that the parts of infinity of extension are immovable is
      rendered difficult when the reader considers Mr. Gillespie's
      sub-proposition (4) that the parts of the material universe are movable
      and divisible from each other. He urges that a part of the infinity of
      extension or of its substratum must penetrate the material universe and
      every atom of it. But if infinity can have no parts, no part of it can
      penetrate the material universe. If infinity have parts (which is absurd),
      and if some part penetrate every atom of the material universe, and if the
      part so penetrating be immovable, how can the material universe be
      considered as movable, and yet as penetrated in every atom by
      immovability? If penetrated be a proper phrase, then, at the moment when
      the part of infinity was penetrating the material universe, the part of
      infinity so penetrating must have been in motion. Mr. Gillespie's logic is
      faulty. Use his own language, and there is either no penetration, or there
      is no immovability.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his argument for the fourth proposition, Mr. Gillespie&mdash;having by
      his previous proposition demonstrated (?) what he calls a substratum for
      the before demonstrated (?) infinity of extension&mdash;says, "it is
      intuitively evident that the substratum of infinity of extension can be no
      more divisible than infinity of extension." Is this so? Might not a
      complex and divisible substratum be conceived by us as possible to
      underlie a (to us) simple and indivisible indefinite extension, if the
      conception of the latter were possible to us? There can not be any
      intuition. It is mere assumption, as, indeed, is the assumption of
      extension at all, other than as the extension of substance. In his
      argument for proposition 5, Gillespie says that "any one who asserts that
      he can suppose two or more necessarily existing beings, each of infinity
      of expansion, is no more to be argued with than one who denies, Whatever
      is, is." Why is it more difficult to suppose this than to suppose one
      being of infinity, and, in addition to this infinity, a material universe?
      Is it impossible to suppose a necessary being of heat, one of light, and
      one of electricity, all occupying the same indefinite expansion? If it be
      replied that you can not conceive two distinct and different beings
      occupying the same point at the same moment, then it must be equally
      impossible to conceive the material universe and God existing together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second division of Mr. Gillespie's argument is also open to grave
      objection. Having demonstrated to his own satisfaction an infinite
      substance, and also having assumed in addition a finite substance, and
      having called the first an infinite "being"&mdash;perhaps from a devout
      objection to speak of God as substance&mdash;Mr. Gillespie seeks to prove
      that the infinite being is intelligent. He says: "Intelligence either
      began to be, or it never began to be. That is never began to be is evident
      in this, that if it began to be, it must have had a cause; for whatever
      begins to be must have a cause. And the cause of intelligence must be of
      intelligence; for what is not of intelligence can not make intelligence
      begin to be. Now intelligence being before intelligence began to be is a
      contradiction. And this absurdity following from the supposition that
      intelligence began to be, it is proved that intelligence never began to
      be: to wit, is of infinity of duration." Mr. Gillespie does not condescend
      to tell us why "what is not of intelligence cannot make intelligence begin
      to be;" but it is not unfair to suppose that he means that of things which
      have nothing in common one can not be the cause of the other. Let us apply
      Mr. Gillespie's argument to the material universe, the existence of which
      is to him so certain that he has treated it as a self-evident proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The material universe&mdash;that is, matter&mdash;either began to be, or
      it never began to be. That it never began to be is evident in this, that
      if it began to be, it must have had a cause; for whatever begins to be
      must have a cause. And the cause of matter must be of matter; for what is
      not of matter can not make matter begin to be. Now matter being before
      matter began to be is contradiction. And this absurdity following from the
      supposition that matter&mdash;i. e., the material universe&mdash;began to
      be, it is proved that the material universe never began to be&mdash;to
      wit, is of indefinite duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The argument as to the eternity of matter is at least as logical as the
      argument for the eternity of intelligence. Mr. Gillespie may reply that he
      affirms the material universe to be finite in duration, and that by the
      argument for his proposition, part 2, he proves that the one infinite
      being (God) is the creator of matter. His words are:
    </p>
    <p>
      "As the material universe is finite in duration, or began to be, it must
      have had a cause; for whatever begins to be must have a cause. And this
      cause must be [Mr. Gillespie does not explain why], in one respect or
      other, the simple sole being of infinity of expansion and duration, who is
      all-knowing [the all-knowing or intelligence rests on the argument which
      has just been shown to be equally applicable to matter], inasmuch as what
      being, or cause independent of that being, could there be? And, therefore,
      that being made matter begin to be." Taking Mr. Gillespie's own argument,
      that which made matter begin to be must be of matter, for what is not
      matter can not make matter begin to be, then Mr. Gillespie's infinite
      being (God) must be matter. But there is yet another exception to the
      preposition, which is that the infinite being (God) is all-powerful.
      Having, as above, argued that the being made matter, he proceeds, "and
      this being shown, it must be granted that the being is, necessarily,
      all-powerful." Nothing of the kind need be granted. If it were true that
      it was demonstrated that the infinite being (God) made matter, it would
      not prove him able to make anything else; it might show the being cause
      enough for that effect, but does not demonstrate him cause for all
      effects. So that if no better argument can be found to prove God
      all-powerful, his omnipotence remains unproved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gillespie's last proposition is that the being (God) whose existence
      he has so satisfactorily (?) made out is necessarily completely happy. In
      dealing with this proposition, Mr. Gillespie talks of unhappiness as
      existing in various kinds and degrees. But, to adopt his own style of
      argument, unhappiness either began to be, or it never began to be. That it
      never began to be is evident in this, that whatever began to be must have
      had a cause, for whatever begins to be must have a cause. And the cause of
      unhappiness must be of unhappiness, for what is not of unhappiness can not
      make unhappiness begin to be. But unhappiness being before unhappiness
      began to be is a contradiction; therefore unhappiness is of infinity of
      duration. But proposition 5, part 2, says there is but one being of
      infinity of duration. The one being of infinity of duration is therefore
      necessarily unhappy. Mr. Gillespie's arguments recoil on himself, and are
      destructive of his own affirmations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his argument for the sub-proposition, Mr. Gillespie says that God's
      motive, or one of his motives, to create, must be believed to have been a
      desire to make happiness, besides his own consummate happiness, begin to
      be. That is, God, who is consummate happiness everywhere forever, <i>desired</i>
      something. That is, he wanted more than then existed. That is, his
      happiness was not complete. That is, Mr. Gillespie refutes himself. But
      what did infinite and eternal complete happiness desire? It desired (says
      Mr. Gillespie) to make more happiness&mdash;that is, to make more than an
      infinity of complete happiness. Mr. Gillespie's proof, on the whole, is at
      most that there exists necessarily substance, the extension and duration
      which we can not limit. Part of his argument involves of the use of the
      very <i>a posteriori</i> reasoning just considered, regarded by himself as
      utterly worthless for the demonstration of the existence of a being with
      such attributes as orthodox Theism tries to assert.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Sir William Hamilton meant no flattery in writing that Mr. Gillespie's
      works was one of the "very ablest" on the Theistic side, how wretched
      indeed must, in his opinion, have been the logic of the less able
      advocates for Theism. Every Theist must admit that if a God exists, he
      could have so convinced all men of the fact of his existence that doubt,
      disagreement, or disbelief would be impossible. If he could not do this,
      he would not be omnipotent, or he would not be omniscient&mdash;that is,
      he would not be God. Every Theist must also agree that if a God exists, he
      would wish all men to have such a clear consciousness of his existence and
      attributes that doubt, disagreement, or belief on this subject would be
      impossible. And this, if for no other reason, because that out of doubts
      and disagreements on religion have too often resulted centuries of
      persecution, strife, and misery, which a good God would desire to prevent.
      If God would not desire this, then he is not all-good&mdash;that is he is
      not God. But as many men have doubts, a large majority of mankind have
      disagreements, and some men have disbeliefs as to God's existence and
      attributes, it follows either that God does not exist, or that he is not
      all-wise, or that he is not all-powerful, or that he is not all-good.

    <p>
      Every child is born into the world an Atheist; and if he grows into a
      Theist, his Deity differs with the country in which the believer may
      happen to be born, or the people among whom he may happen to be educated.
      The belief is the result of education or organization. Religious belief is
      powerful in proportion to the want of scientific knowledge on the part of
      the believer. The more ignorant, the more credulous. In the mind of the
      Theist "God" is equivalent to the sphere of the unknown; by the use of the
      Word he answers without thought problems which might otherwise obtain
      scientific solution. The more ignorant the Theist, the greater his God.
      Belief in God is not a faith founded on reason, but a prostration of the
      reasoning faculties on the threshold of the unknown. Theism is worse than
      illogical; its teachings are not only without utility; but of itself it
      has nothing to teach. Separated from Christianity with its almost
      innumerable sects, from Maliometanism with its numerous divisions, and
      separated also from every other preached system, Theism is a
      Will-o'-the-wisp, without reality. Apart from orthodoxy, Theism is a
      boneless skeleton; the various mythologies give it alike flesh and bone,
      otherwise coherence it hath none. What does Christian Theism teach? That
      the first man made perfect by the all-powerful, all-wise, all-good God,
      was nevertheless imperfect, and by his imperfection brought misery into
      the world, when the all-good God must have intended misery should never
      come. That this God made men to share this misery&mdash;men whose fault
      was their being what he made them. That this God begets a son, who is
      nevertheless his unbegotten self, and that by belief in the birth of God's
      eternal son, and in the death of the undying who died to satisfy God's
      vengeance, man may escape the consequences of the first man's error.
      Christian Theism declares that belief alone can save man, and yet
      recognizes the fact that man's belief results from teaching, by
      establishing missionary societies to spread the faith. Christian Theism
      teaches that God, though no respecter of persons, selected as his
      favorites one nation in preference to all others: that man can do no good
      of himself or without God's aid, but yet that each man has a free will;
      that God is all-powerful, but that few go to heaven and the majority to
      hell; that all are to love God, who has predestined from eternity that by
      far the largest number of human beings are to be burning in hell for ever.
      Yet the advocates for Theism venture to upbraid those who argue against
      such a faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either Theism is true or false. If true, discussion must help to spread
      its influence; if false, the sooner it ceases to influence human conduct
      the better for human kind. It will be useless for the clergy to urge that
      such a pamphlet deserves no reply. It is true the writer is unimportant,
      and the language in which his thoughts find expression lacks the polish of
      a Macaulay, and the fervor of a Burke; but they are nevertheless his
      thoughts, uttered because it is not only his right, but his duty, to give
      them utterance. And this Plea for Atheism is put forth challenging the
      Theists to battle for their cause, and in the hope that the strugglers
      being sincere, truth may give laurels to the victor and the vanquished;
      laurels to the victor in that he has upheld the truth; laurels still
      welcome to the vanquished, whose defeat crowns him with a truth he knew
      not of before.

      IS THERE A GOD?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Some of those who have heard me venture to examine the question of the
      existence of Deity <i>viva voce</i>, have desired to have my reasons for
      holding the Atheistic position briefly stated, and while I do not pretend
      to exhaust the subject in these few pages, I trust to say enough to
      provoke thought and inquiry. I do not say, "There is no God," and the
      scarcely polite rejoinder of those who quote the Psalmist can not,
      therefore, be applied with justice toward myself. I have never yet heard
      living man give me a clear, coherent definition of the word "God," and I
      have never read any definition from either dead or living man expressing a
      definite and comprehensible idea of Deity. In fact, it has always appeared
      to me that men use that word rather to hide their ignorance than to
      express their knowledge.*
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * In Sir William Hamilton's Essay on Cousin, I find a note
     quoting Mr. Piesse on Kant, in which the word God stands
     as the equivalent for a phase of the unknowable.
</pre>
    <p>
      Climatic conditions often, and diversity of human race always, govern and
      modify the meaning conveyed by the word. By "God" one nation or sect
      expresses love; another, vengeance; another, good; another, wisdom;
      another, fire; another, water; another, air; another, earth; and some even
      confound their notion of Deity with that of devil. Elihu Palmer well
      observes: "The Christian world worships three infinite gods, and one
      omniscient devil." I do not deny "God," because that word conveys to me no
      idea, and I can not deny that which presents to me no distinct
      affirmation, and of which the would-be affirmer has no conception. I can
      not war with a nonentity. If, however, God is affirmed to represent an
      existence which is distinct from the existence of which I am a mode, and
      which it is alleged is not the <i>noumenon</i>, of which the word "I"
      represents only a specialty of <i>phenomena</i>, then I deny "God," and
      affirm that it is impossible "God" can be. That is, I affirm that there is
      one existence, and deny that there can be more than one. Atheists are
      sometimes content to say to their opponents, your "proofs" are no proofs,
      your "evidences" are failures, you do not and can not prove the existence
      of Deity. This ground may be safe, but the conduct of its occupier is not
      daring. The swordsman who always guarded and parried, but never ventured
      cut or thrust, might himself escape unwounded, but he would thus make but
      little progress toward victory over his opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is well to show that the position of your antagonist is weak, but it is
      better to prove that you are strong.

    <p>
      In a paper as limited as the present, it is necessary to be brief both in
      answer to opponents and in the statements of my own opinions. This is
      rather intended as the challenging speech of a debate, not as a complete
      essay on the existence of Deity.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two modes in which Theists endeavor to prove the existence of
      God, and each of these modes is in its turn denounced by Theistic writers&mdash;1st,
      the <i>a priori</i>; 2d, the <i>a posteriori</i>. Of the former, Pearson,
      in his "Prize Essay on Infidelity," says: "The <i>a priori</i> mode of
      reasoning is the exclusive idol of many of the German logicians.... But in
      their hands this kind of reasoning has completely failed. It conducts the
      mind to no firm resting place; it bewilders instead of elucidating our
      notions of God, of man, and the universe. It gives us no divine personal
      existence, and leaves us floating in a region of mere vague abstractions.
      Such reasonings are either altogether vain or are not really what they
      profess to be. In our country the name of Dr. Clarke is chiefly associated
      with the <i>a priori</i> argument.... Clarke himself found it necessary to
      stoop to the argument <i>a posteriori</i>, and thereby acknowledged the
      fallacy of attempting to reason exclusively <i>a priori</i>.... The fate
      of Dr. Clarke's pretended demonstration, and the result, in so far as
      theology is concerned, of the transcendental reasoning of the continental
      philosophers, show the futility of attempting to rise up to the height of
      the great argument of the existence of God by the <i>a priori</i> method
      alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the latter, William Gillespie, in his "Treatise on the Necessary
      Existence of Deity," writes that it "can never make it appear that
      infinity belongs in any way to God." It "can only entitle us to infer the
      existence of a being of finite extension, for, by what rule in philosophy
      can we deduce from the existence of an object finite in extent (and
      nothing is plainer than that the marks of design which we can discover
      must be finite in their extent) the existence of a cause of infinity of
      extension? What, then, becomes of the omnipresence of the Deity, according
      to those who are content to rest satisfied from the reasoning of
      experience?... It will be vain to talk of the Deity being present by his
      energy? although he may not be present by his substance, to the whole
      universe. For, 'tis natural to ask not so much how it is proved that God
      is virtually present, though not substantially present, in every part of
      nature, as what can be meant by being everywhere present by mere energy?"
      This reasoning can no more make out that the Deity is omnipresent by his
      virtue, than that he is omnipresent as to his substance.... And, from the
      inaptitude of the reasoning under consideration to show that immensity, or
      omnipresence, belongs to God, it will be found to follow, directly and
      immediately, that his wisdom and power can not be shown to be more than
      finite, and that he can never be proved to be a free agent....
      Omnipresence (let it be only by energy) is absolutely necessary in a being
      of infinity of wisdom. And therefore, 'the design argument' is unable to
      evince that the Deity is in possession of this attribute. It likewise
      plainly follows, from the inaptitude of this argument to show that God is
      omnipresent, that thereby we can not prove infinity of power to belong to
      him. For, if the argument can not make out that the being it discovers is
      everywhere present, how can it ever make out that he is everywhere
      powerful? By careful reflection, too, we may perceive that omnipotence of
      another kind than power, winch can exert itself in all places, requires
      the existence of immensity. "The design argument" can never evince that
      God is a free agent....
    </p>
    <p>
      If we can not prove the immensity or omnipresence of the Deity, we can for
      that reason never show that he is omniscient, that he is omnipotent, that
      he is entirely free.... If the Deity can not be proved to be of infinity
      in any given respect, it would be nothing less than absurd to suppose that
      he could be proved to be of infinity in any other respect. It "can do no
      more than prove that at the commencement of the phenomena which pass under
      its review, there existed a cause exactly sufficient to make the effects
      begin to be. That this cause existed from eternity, the reasonings from
      experience by no means show. Nay, for aught they make known, the designer
      himself may not have existed long before those marks of design which
      betoken his workmanship." This reasoning "can not prove that the God whom
      it reveals has existed from all eternity, therefore, for anything it
      intimates, God may at some time cease to be, and the workmanship may have
      an existence when the workman hath fallen into annihilation.... Such
      reasonings can never assure us of the unity of the Deity." Whether there
      be one God or not, the argument from experience doth by no means make
      clear. It discovers marks of design in the phenomena of nature, and infers
      the existence of at least one intelligent substance sufficient to produce
      them. Further, however, it advances not our knowledge. Whether the cause
      of the phenomena be one God or many Gods, it pretends not to determine
      past all doubt.... But did this designer create the matter in which the
      design appeared? Of this the argument can not convince us, for it does no
      more than infer a designing cause from certain appearances, in the same
      way we would infer from finding some well-contrived machine in a desert
      that a human being had left it there.... Now, because this reasoning can
      not convince us of such a creation, it can not convince us there is not a
      plurality of deities, or of the causes of things.... If we can not prove
      the eternity of God, it is not possible we can prove the unity of God. To
      say that, for anything we know to the contrary, he may have existed from
      all eternity, being much the same as saying that, for anything we know to
      the contrary, there may be another God or many Gods beside." Sir W.
      Hamilton considered that the only valid arguments for the existence of a
      God, and for the immortality of the human soul, rest on the ground of
      man's moral nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Lyman Beecher issued, some few years since, a series of lectures on
      Atheism, without merit or fairness, and which are here only alluded to as
      fairly illustrating a certain class of orthodox opposition. His statements
      of Atheistic opinions are monstrous perversions, and his answers are
      directed against the straw man built together by himself. The doctrine of
      "almighty chance" which Dr. Beecher attacks, is one which I never heard an
      educated Atheist teach, and the misrepresentation of Freethought objects
      is so obvious that it can only be effectual with those who have never
      freed themselves from the trammels which habit and fashion-faith bound
      upon them in their infancy, and which have strengthened with their growth.
      The Rev. J. Orr, in his "Treatise on Theism," says, "All inquiry about
      chance is, however, impertinent in the present day. The idea is an
      infantine one, possible of entertainment only in the initial state of
      human knowledge. Chance is <i>not</i> the position relied upon by modern
      Atheism. And when, therefore, the Theist expends the artillery of his
      argument upon this broken down and obsolete notion, he is intermeddling
      with the dead, and after accomplishing the destruction of the venerable
      fallacy, the modern Atheist will likely ask him to come down to the
      nineteenths century and meet him there."
    </p>
    <p>
      The only attempt at argument in Dr. Beecher's book is founded on the
      assumption:
    </p>
    <p>
      1st. That there is an existence called matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      2d. That there are certain effects perceivable which can not result from
      matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      3d. That therefore there is a God the cause for these effects. Where are
      there any Materialists who accept Dr. Beecher's limitation of matter? It
      is a word I do not use myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the question of evil, Coleridge, in his "Aids to Reflection," says:
      "1st. That evil must have had a beginning, since otherwise it must either
      be God or a co-eternal and co-equal rival with God. 2d. That it could not
      originate in God; for if so, it would at once be evil and not evil, or God
      would be at once God&mdash;that is, infinite goodness&mdash;and not God."
      If God be infinite goodness, can evil exist at all? It is necessary above
      all that we should understand the meaning of each word we use. Some men
      talk as if their words were intended rather to conceal than to express
      their ideas. So far as this essay is concerned I will endeavor to avoid
      this difficulty by explicitly defining each special word I use. Dugald
      Stewart, indeed, says, "That there are many words used in philosophical
      discourse which do not admit of logical definition, is abundantly
      manifest. This is the case with all those words that signify things
      un-compounded, and consequently unsusceptible of analysis&mdash;a
      proposition, one should think, almost self-evident; and yet it is
      surprising how very generally it has been overlooked by philosophers."
    </p>
    <p>
      The advantages, however, accruing from frequent definitions are very
      great; at the least they serve to explain what was meant by the persons
      using the word, whereas sometimes two men confuse each word by using words
      to which each attaches an opposite or a dissimilar value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men will talk of "First Cause," and "Intelligent First Cause." Do they
      know what they mean? I confess I do not, and from the manner in which they
      use the words, the most charitable conclusion is that they use them
      because others have done so, and for no worse or better reason. They talk
      of the "Beauties of Creation," and "Works of the Great Creator." If by
      creation is meant the origin of existence, then each utterance of the
      phrase is an absurdity. The human mind is utterly incapable of construing
      it in thought as possible that the complement of existence has either been
      increased or diminished. Man can neither conceive nothing becoming
      something nor something becoming nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Definitions.&mdash;1. By existence, or substance, I mean that which is in
      itself and is conceived <i>per se</i>&mdash;that is, the conception of
      which does not require the conception of anything else as antecedent to
      it. Whenever I use the words universe or matter, I use them in the same
      sense as representing the totality of existence. Existence can only be
      known in its modes, and these by their attributes. 2. By attribute, I
      understand that by which I cognize any mode of existence. Hardness,
      brightness, color, life, form, etc., are attributes of conditional
      existence. 3. By mode, I understand each cognized condition or accident of
      existence. 4. By eternity I mean indefinite duration; that is duration
      which is to me illimitable. 5. By infinity, I mean indefinite extension.
      The axioms, so far as I shall give them, are in the precise language of
      Spinoza. "1. Everything which is, is in itself, or in some other thing..
      2. That which cannot be conceived through another <i>per aliud</i>, must
      be conceived <i>per se</i>. 3. From a given determinate cause, the effect
      necessarily follows; and, <i>vice versa</i>, if no determinate cause be
      given, no effect can follow. 4. The knowledge of an effect depends on a
      knowledge of the cause, and includes it. 5. Things that have nothing in
      common with each other, can not be understood by means of each other&mdash;that
      is, the conception of one does not involve the conception of the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      Propositions.&mdash;Existence is prior to its modes. This follows from
      definitions 1 and 3, because modes of existence are conceived relatively
      and in dependence on existence, which is absolutely precedent in such
      conception. Existences having different attributes have nothing in common
      with each other. This is founded on definition 1. Existences have nothing
      in common with each other, can not be the cause of, or affect one another.
      If they have nothing in common, they can not be conceived by means of each
      other (per axiom 5), and they can not be conceived as relating to each
      other, but must be conceived <i>per se</i> (per definition 1); and as (per
      axiom 4) the knowledge of an effect depends on the knowledge of the cause
      and includes it, it is impossible to conceive any existence as an effect,
      so long as you can not conceive it in relation to any other existence. By
      "cause" in the absolute, I mean "existence." In its popular or relative
      sense, I use "cause" as an effect of some precedent causative influence,
      itself the cause of some consequent effect, as the means toward an end, in
      the accomplishment of which end it completes itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      What fact is there so certain that I may base all my reasonings upon it?
      My existence is this primary fact; this, to me, indubitable certainty. I
      am. This logic can neither prove nor disprove. The very nature of proof is
      to make a proposition more clear to the mind than it was before, and no
      amount of evidence can in-crease my conviction of the certainty of my own
      existence. I do not affirm that I am in existence, but I affirm that there
      is existence. This existence is either eternal, that is, unlimited in
      duration, that is, indefinite in duration; or else it had a beginning,
      that is, it has been created. If created, then such creation must be by
      some existence the same as itself, or by some existence differing from
      itself. But it can not have been created by any existence the same as
      itself, because to imagine such, would be to conceive no more than a
      continuance of the same existence&mdash;there would be no discontinuity.
      "But," says S. T. Coleridge, "where there is no discontinuity, there can
      be no origination." And it can not have been created by any existence
      differing from itself, because things which have nothing in common with
      one another can not be the cause of, or affect, one another. Therefore,
      this existence has not been created, that is, its duration is indefinite&mdash;that
      is, you can not conceive a beginning&mdash;that is, it is eternal. This
      eternal existence is either infinite in extent, that is, is unlimited in
      extent, or it is finite, that is, limited. If limited, it must be limited
      by an existence the same as itself, or by an existence differing from
      itself. But the same arguments which applied to a limitation of duration,
      also apply to a limitation of extension. Therefore, this existence is
      unlimited in extent; that is, is infinite and eternal&mdash;that is, there
      is only one existence. It is at this point that Atheism separates from
      Pantheism. Pantheism demonstrates one existence, but affirms for it
      infinite attributes. Atheism denies that attributes can be infinite.
      Attributes are but the distinguishing characteristics of modes, and how
      can that be infinite which is only the quality of finity? Men do not talk
      of infinite hardness or of infinite softness; yet they talk of infinite
      intelligence. Intelligence is not an existence, and the word is without
      value unless it strictly comprehend, and is included in, that which is
      intelligent. The hardness of the diamond, the brilliancy of the burnished
      steel, have no existence apart from the diamond or the steel. I, in fact,
      affirm that there is only one existence, and that all we take cognizance
      of is mode, or attribute of mode, of that existence.

      I have carefully abstained from using the words "matter" and "spirit." Dr.
      Priestly says: "It has generally been supposed that there are <i>two
      distinct kinds of substance</i> in human nature, and they have been
      distinguished by the terms <i>matter</i>, and <i>spirit</i>, or <i>mind</i>.
      The former of these has been said to be possessed of the property of <i>extension</i>,
      viz., of length, breadth and thickness, and also of <i>solidity</i> or
      impenetrability, and consequently of a <i>vis inertiæ</i>; but it is said
      to be naturally destitute of all other powers whatever. The latter has of
      late been defined to be a substance entirely destitute of all extension,
      or relation to space, so as to have no property in common with matter; and
      therefore to be properly <i>immaterial</i>, but to be possessed of the
      powers of perception, intelligence, and self-motion. Matter is alleged to
      be that kind of substance of which our bodies are composed, whereas the
      principle of perception and thought belonging to us is said to reside in a
      spirit, or immaterial principle, intimately united to the body; while
      higher orders of intelligent beings, and especially the Divine Being, are
      said to be purely immaterial. It is maintained that neither matter nor
      spirit (meaning by the latter the subject of sense and thought) correspond
      to the definitions above mentioned. For that matter is not that <i>inert</i>
      substance that it has been supposed to be; that powers of <i>attraction or
      repulsion</i> are necessary to its very being, and that no part of it
      appears to be <i>impenetrable</i> to other parts; I therefore define it to
      be a substance possessed of the property of extension, and powers of
      attraction or repulsion; and since it has never yet been asserted that the
      powers of <i>sensation</i> and <i>thought</i> are incompatible with these
      (<i>solidity or impenetrability</i>, and, consequently, a <i>vis inertiæ</i>,
      only having been thought to be repugnent to them), I therefore maintain
      that we have no reason to suppose that there are in man two substances so
      distinct from each other as have been represented. It is likewise
      maintained that the notion of two substances that have no common property,
      and yet are capable of intimate connection and mutual action, is absurd."
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not conceive <i>spirit or mind</i> as an existence. By the word <i>mind</i>,
      I simply express the totality of perception, observation, collection, and
      recollection of perceptions, reflection and various other mental
      processes. Dugald Stewart, in his "Essay on Locke," says: "We are
      conscious of sensation, thought, desire, volition, but we are not
      conscious of the existence of the mind itself."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is urged that the idea of God is universal. This is not only not true,
      but I, in fact, deny that any coherent idea exists in connection with the
      word "God." The chief object to which the emotions of any people were
      directed in ancient times became their God. When these emotions were
      combined with vague traditions, and a priesthood became interested in
      handing down the traditions, and increasing the emotions, then the object
      becoming sacred was hallowed and adored, and uncertain opinions formed the
      basis of a creed. Any prominent phenomenon in the universe, which was not
      understood, was personified, as were also the various passions and phases
      of humanity. These, in time, were preached as religious truths, and thus
      diverted the people from inquiry into the natural causes of phenomena,
      which they accounted for as ordained by God, and when famine or pestilence
      occurred, instead of endeavoring to remove its cause or using preventive
      measures against a recurrence of the evil, they sought to discover why the
      supernatural power was offended, and how it might be appeased, and
      ascribing to it their own passions and emotions, they offered prayers and
      sacrifices. These errors becoming institutions of the country, the people,
      prompted by their priests, regarded all those who endeavored to overturn
      them by free and scientific thought and speech as blasphemers, and the
      Religion of each State has, therefore, always been opposed to the
      education of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archbishop Whately, in his "Elements of Rhetoric," part 1, chap, ii, sec.
      5, urges that "those who represent God or Gods as malevolent, capricious,
      or subject to human passions and vices, are invariably to be found among
      those who are brutal and uncivilized." We admit this, but ask is it not
      the fact that both the Old and New Testament teachings do represent God as
      malevolent, capricious, and subject to human passions and vices&mdash;that
      is, are not these bible views of God relics of a brutal and uncivilized
      people?
    </p>
    <p>
      There is, of course, not room in a short essay like the present to say
      much upon the morality of Atheism, and it should therefore suffice to say,
      that truth and morality go hand in hand. That that is moral which tends to
      the permanent happiness of all. The continuance of falsehood never can
      result in permanent happiness; and therefore if Atheism be truthful, it
      must be moral, if it be against falsehood, it must tend to human
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet if quoting great names will have effect, Lord Bacon, who is often
      quoted against Atheism, also says: "Atheism leaves a man to sense, to
      philosophy, to natural piety, to laws, to reputation, all of which may be
      guides to an outward moral virtue, <i>though religion were not</i>; but
      superstition dismounts all these, and erecteth an absolute monarchy in the
      mind of men; therefore Atheism never did perturb states, for it makes men
      wary of themselves as looking no further; and we see the times inclined to
      Atheism, as the times of Augustus Caesar were civil times; but
      superstition has been the confusion of many states." George Combe says: "I
      have known men in whom the reasoning organs were amply developed and well
      cultivated, who assured me that they could not reach the conviction of the
      being of a God. I have known such men equal in point of integrity and
      practical benevolence to the most orthodox believers." In the West Riding
      of Yorkshire, among the men themselves, a wealthy employer bore favorable
      testimony to the conduct and intelligence of Atheistic working men. Nay,
      even the fanatical Dr. Lyman Beecher is obliged to concede that Atheism
      made converts among "females of education and refinement&mdash;females of
      respectable standing in society."

      HAS MAN A SOUL?
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [This lecture was originally delivered to the Sheffield
     Secular Society, and was printed from the reporter's notes
     without efficient correction from myself, I, at that time,
     suffering under a severe attack of acute rheumatism. The
     lecture has since been often re-delivered; and three
     editions having been exhausted, I have again corrected and
     revised the present edition. It is not intended as an answer
     to the question which forms the title, but it is intended to
     provoke thought upon this important subject.]
</pre>
    <p>
      What do you mean by soul? What is the soul? Is it I? Is it the body? Is it
      apart from the body? Is it an attribute of the body? Has it a separate and
      distinct existence from the body? What is the soul? If I ask one of those
      who claim to be considered orthodox men, they will tell me that the soul
      is a spirit&mdash;that the soul lives after the body is dead. They will
      tell me that the soul is immortal, and that the body is mortal; that the
      soul has nothing whatever in common with the body; that it has an
      existence entirely independent of the body. They will tell me that after
      the body has decayed&mdash;after the body has become re-absorbed in the
      universe, of which it is but a part, that the soul still exists. Is there
      any proof of the existence of the same individual soul apart from all
      material conditions? I have endeavored to examine this subject, and, up to
      the present time, I have not found one iota of proof in support of the
      positions thus put forward. I have no idea of any existence except that of
      which I am part. I am. Of my own existence I am certain I think. I am. But
      what is it that thinks? Is it my soul? Is it "me," and yet distinct from
      me? I am but a mode of existence. I am only part of the great universe.
      The elements of which I am composed are indissolubly connected with that
      great existence which is around me and within me, and which I help to make
      up. If men tell me I am a compound, and not a compound&mdash;a mixture,
      and not a mixture&mdash;a joining together, and not a joining together&mdash;of
      two entirely different existences, which they call "matter" and "spirit,"
      I am compelled to doubt those men. The ability to think is but an
      attribute of a certain modification of existence. Intelligence is a word
      by which we express the sum of certain abilities, always attending a
      certain mode of existence. I find intelligence manifested so far as
      organization is developed. I never find intelligence without animal
      organization. I find intelligence manifested in degree, only so far as I
      find a higher or lower type of organization&mdash;that is, I find man's
      intellectual faculties limited by his organization. But the orthodox tell
      me that my soul has an immaterial existence, independent of all
      organization&mdash;independent of all climatic conditions&mdash;independent
      of all education. Is that so? When does the soul come into man? When does
      it go out of man? If the soul is immortal, why is it that standing here,
      in the prime of health and strength, if part of that roof should fall
      fracturing my skull, and pressing upon my brain&mdash;how is it, if my
      soul is not subject to material conditions, that it then ceases to act? Is
      the plaster roof more powerful than my immortal soul? Or is it that
      intelligence is the necessary result of a certain condition of existence,
      and that the moment you destroy that condition&mdash;the moment you
      destroy the organization&mdash;the result ceases to be realizable? By the
      course of reasoning you adopt (says the orthodox objector) you reduce man
      to the same level as the beasts. And why not? I stand on the river's bank,
      I see there a man full grown, possessed of the physical figure of man, but
      an idiot&mdash;an idiot from his birth upward&mdash;one who could not,
      even if he would, think and act as other men. A little child is there
      playing on the bank, and the idiot, having large destructive propensities,
      has thrust the child into the water, and he stands there jabbering and
      gesticulating while the little child is drowning in the river. And see how
      half-vacantly, half-triumphantly, he points to the helpless child. A
      Newfoundland dog has come to the bank; it jumps in and brings the child
      out and saves its life. Yet theologians tell me that the idiot has a soul,
      and that the Newfoundland dog has not one. I can not understand these nice
      distinctions, which make the man so superior to the beast in matters in
      which he is positively inferior. Man has doubtless an organization on the
      whole far superior intellectually to that of any other animal, but he is
      only superior by virtue of his superior organization and its consequent
      susceptibility for development or education. Many brutes can see more
      clearly than man; but they possess not the capability for the manufacture
      of telescopes to aid their vision. Many brutes can run more swiftly, but
      they manifest no capacity for the subjugation of a steam power which far
      outstrips their speed. But man himself, a well-organized, thoughtful,
      intelligent, well-educated man, by a fall from a horse, by a tile from a
      roof, may receive an injury to his nervous encephalic apparatus, and may
      be, even while a man in shape, as low as the brute in the imbecility of
      his reason, and inferior to the brute in physical strength. There is as
      much difference between different races of men, there is, in fact, more
      difference between a pure Caucasian and a Sahara negro, than between the
      Sahara negro and the infant chimpanzee.

      When did the soul come into the body? Has it been waiting from all
      eternity to occupy each body the moment of birth? Is this the theory that
      is put forward to man&mdash;that there are many millions of souls still
      waiting, perhaps, in mid air, 'twixt heaven and earth, to occupy the still
      unborn babes? Is that the theory? Or do you allege that God specially
      creates souls for each little child at the moment it is born or conceived?
      Which is the theory put forward? Is it that the soul being immortal&mdash;being
      destined to exist for ever, has existed from all eternity? If not, how do
      you know that the soul is to exist for ever; when it only comes into
      existence with the child? May not that which has recently begun to be,
      soon cease to be? In what manner does the soul come into the child? Is it
      a baby's soul, and does it grow with the child? or, does it possess its
      full power the moment the child is born? When does it come into the child?
      Does it come in the moment the child begins to form, or is it the moment
      the child is born into the world? Whence is it this soul comes? Dr.
      Cooper, quoting Lawrence on the "Functions of the Brain," says: "Sir
      Everard Home, with the assistance of Mr. Bauer and his microscope, has
      shown us a man eight days old from the time of conception, about as broad
      and a little longer than a pin's head. He satisfied himself that the brain
      of this homunculus was discernible. Could the immaterial mind have been
      connected with it at this time? Or was the tenement too small even for so
      etherial a lodger? Even at the full period of uterogestation, it is still
      difficult to trace any vestiges of mind: and the believers in its separate
      existence have left us quite in the dark on the precise time when they
      suppose this union of soul and body to take place." Many of those who tell
      me that man has a soul, and that it is immortal&mdash;that man has a soul,
      and that the beast has not one&mdash;forget or ignore the fact that at a
      very early stage in the formation of the brain the state of the brain
      corresponds to that of the avertebrated animal, or animal that is without
      vertebra. If the brain had stopped in its first month's course of
      formation, would the child have had a soul? If it would have had a soul,
      then have avertebrated animals souls also? If you tell me it would not
      have had a soul, then I ask, How do you know it? and I ask you what ground
      you have for assuming that the soul did not begin to form with the
      formation of the brain? I ask you whether it was pre-existing, or at what
      stage it came? In the second month this brain corresponds then to the
      brain of an osseous fish. Supposing the development of the child had been
      then stopped, had it a soul at that time? If so, have fishes souls? Again,
      if you tell me that the child had not a soul, then, I ask, why not? How do
      you know it had not? What ground have you for alleging that the soul did
      not exist in the child? We go on still further, and in the third month we
      find that brain corresponds then to that of a turtle, and in the fourth to
      that of a bird; and in the fifth month, to an order termed <i>rodentia</i>;
      sixth, to that of the <i>ruminantia</i>; seventh, to that of the <i>dugitigrada</i>;
      eighth, to that of the <i>quadrumana</i>; and not till the ninth month
      does the brain of the child attain a full human character. I, of course,
      here mean to allege no more than Dr. Fletcher, who says, in his "Rudiments
      of Physiology," quoted by the author of the "Vestiges of Creation": "This
      is only an approximation to the truth; since neither is the brain of all
      osseous fishes, of all turtles, of all birds, nor of all the species of
      any of the above order of mammals, by any means precisely the same; nor
      does the brain of the human fetus at any time precisely resemble, perhaps,
      that of any individual whatever among the lower animals. Nevertheless it
      may be said to represent, at each of the above-named periods, the
      aggregate, as it were, of the brains of each of the tribes stated."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, should a birth have taken place at any of the eight stages, would the
      child thus prematurely born have had a soul? That is the question I
      propose to you. You who affirm that man has a soul, it lies upon you,
      here, without charging me with blasphemy&mdash;without charging me with
      ignorance&mdash;without charging me with presumption&mdash;it lies upon
      you who affirm, to state the grounds for your belief. At which stage, if
      at any, did the soul come into the child? At the moment of the birth? Why
      when a child is born into the world it can scarcely see&mdash;it can not
      speak&mdash;it can not think&mdash;but after a short time I jingle my
      keys, and it begins to give faint smiles; and after a few weeks, it is
      pleased with the jingling of my keys. Is it the soul which is learning to
      appreciate the sound of the jingling keys, and pleased with them? Is it
      the immaterial and immortal soul amused and pleased with my bundle of
      keys? Where is the soul? How is it that the soul can not speak the moment
      the child is born&mdash;can not even think? How is it, that if I keep that
      child without telling it any thing of its soul until it become fourteen or
      fifteen years of age, it would then speak and think as I had taught it to
      speak and think; and if I kept it without the knowledge of a soul, it
      would have no knowledge of a soul at that age? How is that? Rajah Brooke,
      at a missionary meeting in Liverpool, told his hearers there that the
      Dyaks, a people with whom he was connected, had no knowledge of God, of a
      soul, or of any future state. How is it that the Dyaks have got this soul
      and yet live knowing nothing whatever about it? And the Dyaks are by no
      means the only people who live and die knowing nothing of any immortal and
      immaterial soul. Again you tell me that this soul is immortal. Do you mean
      that it has eternally existed&mdash;has never been created? If so, you
      deny a God who is the creator of all things. If the soul began at some
      time to exist, where is the evidence that it will not also at some time
      cease to exist? It it came into existence with the body's birth, why not
      cease with the body's death? You say the soul is immaterial; do you mean
      that it is susceptible to material conditions or do you not? If
      susceptible to material conditions, what do you mean by its being immortal
      and immaterial? If not susceptible to material conditions, then explain to
      me how it is that under good conditions it prospers and advances, and
      under bad conditions deteriorates and recedes. If a child is born in some
      of the back streets of our city, and lives on bad food in a wretched
      cellar, it grows up a weak and puny pale-faced child. If allowed to crawl
      into existence on the edge of a gutter, imperfectly educated, in fact
      mis-educated, it steals&mdash;steals, perhaps, to live&mdash;and it
      becomes an outcast from society. Is this immortal soul affected by the
      bodily conditions? or is the soul originally naturally depraved? And if
      the soul is primarily naturally depraved, why is God so unjust as to give
      a naturally depraved soul to any body? If not, how is it that this
      immortal soul, when the body is kept without food, permits the man who has
      no money to buy food, to steel to satisfy his hunger? You allege that the
      soul moves my body. You assert that matter is inert, unintelligent; that
      it is my active, intelligent soul that moves and impels my inert and
      non-intelligent body. Is my immortal soul hindered and controlled by the
      state of my body's general health? Does my soul feel hungry and compel my
      body to steal? Some theologians declare that my soul is immaterial&mdash;that
      there is no means by which I can take any cognizance whatever of it. What
      does that mean, except that they know nothing whatever about it? Sir W.
      Hamilton admits that we are entirely ignorant as to the connection between
      soul and body. Yet many who in so many words admit that they have no
      knowledge, but only faith in the soul's existence, are most presumptuous
      in affirming it, and in denouncing those who dispute their affirmation. It
      is an easy method to hide ignorance, by denouncing your opponent as an
      ignorant blasphemer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph Priestley, in his book upon matter and spirit, quotes from Hallet's
      discourses, as follows; "I see a man move and hear him speak for some
      years. From his speech I certainly infer that he thinks, as I do. I then
      see that man is a being who thinks and acts. After some time the man falls
      down in my sight, grows cold and stiff, and speaks and acts no more. Is it
      not then natural to conclude that he thinks no more; as the only reason I
      had to believe that he did think was his motion and his speech. And now
      that his motion and speech have ceased, I have lost the only way of
      proving that he had the power of thought. Upon this sudden death, one
      visible thing, the one man, has greatly changed. Whence could I infer that
      the same being consisted of two parts, and that the inward part continues
      to live and think, and flies away from the body? When the outward part
      ceases to live and move, it looks as if the whole <i>man</i> was gone, and
      that he, with all his powers, ceases at the same time. His motion and
      thought both die together, as far as I can discern. The powers of thought,
      of speech and motion, equally depend upon the body, and run the same fate
      in case of declining age. When a man dies through old age, I perceive his
      powers of speech, motion, and thought decay and die together, and by the
      same degrees. That moment he ceases to move and breathe he appears to
      cease to think, too. When I am left to my reason it seems to me that my
      power of thought depends as much upon the body as my sight and hearing. I
      could not think in infancy; my power of thought, of sight, and of feeling
      are equally liable to be obstructed by the body. A blow on the head has
      deprived a man of thought, who could yet see, and feel and move; so
      naturally the power of thinking seems as much to belong to the body as any
      power of man whatsoever. Naturally there appears no more reason to suppose
      that a man can think out of the body than he can hear sounds and feel cold
      out of the body."
    </p>
    <p>
      What do those mean who say that man is made up of two parts&mdash;matter
      and mind? I know of only one existence. I find that existence manifested
      variously, each mode having certain variations of attributes by which it
      is cognized. One of these attributes, or a collection of certain
      attributes, I find in, or with, certain modifications of that existence,
      that is, in or with animal life&mdash;this attribute, or these attributes,
      we call intelligence. In the same way that I find upon the blade of a
      knife brightness, consequent upon a certain state of the metal, so do I
      find in man, in the beast, different degrees, not of brightness, but of
      intelligence, according to their different states of organization. I am
      told that the mind and the body are separate from one another. Are the
      brightness and steel of the knife separate? Is not brightness the quality
      attaching to a certain modification of existence&mdash;steel? Is not
      intelligence a quality attaching to a certain modification of existence&mdash;man?
      The word brightness has no meaning, except as relating to some bright
      thing. The word intelligence, no meaning, except as relating to some
      intelligent thing. I take some water and drop it upon the steel, in due
      course the process of oxidation takes place and the brightness is gone. I
      drop into man's brain a bullet; the process of destruction of life takes
      place, and his intelligence is gone. By changing the state of the steel we
      destroy its brightness, and by disorganizing the man destroy his
      intelligence. Is mind an entity or result? an existence or a condition?
      Surely it is but the result of organic activity, a phenomenon of animal
      life. Dr. Engledue says: "In the same way as organism generally has the
      power of manifesting, when the necessary stimuli are applied, the
      phenomena which are designated life; so one individual portion&mdash;brain,
      having peculiar and distinct properties, manifests on the application of
      its appropriate stimuli a peculiar and distinct species of action. If the
      sum of all bodily function&mdash;life, be not an entity, how can the
      product of the action of one portion of the body&mdash;brain, be an
      entity? Feeling and intelligence are but fractional portions of life." I
      ask those who are here to prove that man has a soul, to do so apart from
      revelation. If the soul is a part of ourselves, we require no supernatural
      revelation to demonstrate its existence to us. D'Holbach says: "The
      doctrine of spirituality, such as it now exists, affords nothing but vague
      ideas; it is rather a poisoner of all ideas. Let me draw your attention to
      this: The advocates of spirituality do not tell you anything, but in fact
      prevent you from knowing anything. They say that spirit and matter have
      nothing in common, and that mortal man can not take cognizance of
      immortality. An ignorant man may set himself up as an orator upon such a
      matter. He says you have a soul&mdash;an immortal soul. Take care you
      don't lose your soul. When you ask him what is my soul, he says he does
      not know&mdash;nobody knows&mdash;nobody can tell you. This is really that
      which they do. What is this doctrine of spirituality? What does it present
      to the mind? A substance unsubstantial that possesses nothing of which our
      senses enable us to take cognizance." Theologians urge that each of us has
      a soul superior to all material conditions, and yet a man who speaks can
      not communicate by his speaking soul so freely with that man who is deaf
      and dumb; the conditions cramp that which is said to be uncontrolled by
      any conditions. If you cut out a man's tongue, the soul no longer speaks.
      If you put a gag in his mouth, and tie it with a handkerchief, so that he
      can not get it out, his soul ceases to speak. The immaterial soul is
      conquered by a gag, it can not utter itself, the gag is in the way. The
      orthodox say that the soul is made by God; and what do you know about God?
      Why just as much as we know about the soul. And what do you know about the
      soul? Nothing whatever. How is it that if the soul is immaterial, having
      nothing in common with matter, that it is only manifest by material means?
      and how is it that it is incased and inclosed in my material frame? They
      affirm that my soul is a spirit&mdash;that I receive the same spirit from
      God. How is it that my spirit is now by myself, and by my mortal body,
      denying its own existence? Is my mortal soul acting the hypocrite, or is
      it ignorant of its own existence, and can not help itself to better
      knowledge? And if it can not help itself, why not, if it is superior to
      the body? and if you think it a hypocrite, tell me why.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is meant by the declaration that man is a compound of matter and
      spirit?&mdash;things which the orthodox assert have nothing in common with
      one another. Of the existence of what you call matter you are certain,
      because you and I, material beings, are here. Are you equally certain of
      the existence of mind, as an existence independent and separate from
      matter? and if you are, tell me why. Have you ever found it apart from
      matter? If so, when and where? Have you found that the mind has a separate
      and distinct existence? if so, under what circumstances? and tell me&mdash;you
      who define matter as unintelligent, passive, inert, and motionless&mdash;who
      talk of the <i>vis inertiæ</i> of matter&mdash;tell me what you mean when
      you give these definitions to it? You find the universe, and this small
      portion of it on which we are, ceaselessly active. Why do you call it
      passive, except it be that you want courage to search for true knowledge
      as to the vast capabilities of existence, and, therefore, invent such
      names as God and Soul to account for all difficulties, and to hide your
      ignorance? What do you mean by passive and inert matter? You tell me of
      this world&mdash;part of a system&mdash;that system part of another&mdash;that
      of another&mdash;and point out to me the innumerable planets, the
      countless millions of worlds, in the universe. You, who tell me of the
      vast forces of the universe, what do you mean by telling me that that is
      motionless? What do you mean by yet pointing to the immeasurable universe
      and its incalculably mighty forces and affirming that they are incapable
      of every perceptible effect? You, without one fact on which to base your
      theory, strive to call into existence another existence which must be more
      vast, and which you allege produces this existence and gives its powers to
      it. Sir Isaac Newton says: "We are to admit no more causes of things than
      are sufficient to explain appearances." What effect is there which the
      forces of existence are incapable of producing?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why do you come to the conclusion that the forces of the universe are
      incapable of producing every effect of which I take cognizance? Why do you
      come to the conclusion that intelligence is not an attribute&mdash;why?
      What is there which enables you to convert it into a separate and distinct
      existence? Is there anything? Is it spirit? What is spirit? That of which
      the mortal man can know nothing, you tell me&mdash;that it is nothing
      which his senses can grasp&mdash;that is, no man, but one who disregards
      his senses, can believe in it, and that it is that which no man's senses
      can take cognizance of. If a man who uses his senses can never by their
      aid take cognizance of spirit, then as it is through the senses alone man
      knows that which is around him, you can know nothing about spirit until
      you go out of your senses. When I speak of the senses, I do not limit
      myself to what are ordinarily termed man's five senses&mdash;I include all
      man's sensitive faculties, and admit that I do not know the extent of, and
      am not prepared to set a limit to, the sensitive capabilities of man. I
      have had personal experience in connection with psycho-magnetic phenomena
      of faculties in man and woman not ordinarily recognized, and am inclined
      to the opinion that many men have been made converts to the theories of
      spiritualism because their previous education had induced them to set
      certain arbitrary limits to the domains of the natural. When they have
      been startled by phenomena outside these conventional limitations they at
      once ascribed them to supernatural influences rather than reverse their
      previous rules of thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some urge that the soul is life. What is life? Is it not the word by which
      we express the aggregate normal functional activity of vegetable and
      animal organisms necessarily differing in degree, if not in kind, with
      each different organization? To talk of immortal life and yet to admit the
      decay and destruction of the organization, is much the same as to talk of
      a square circle. You link together two words which contradict each other.
      The solution of the soul problem is not so difficult as many imagine. The
      greatest difficulty is, that we have been trained to use certain words as
      "God," "matter," "mind," "spirit," "soul," "intelligence," and we have
      been further trained to take these words as representatives of realities,
      which, in fact, they do not represent. We have to unlearn much of our
      school lore. We have specially to carefully examine the meaning of each
      word we use. The question, lies in a small compass. Is there one existence
      or more? Of one existence I am conscious, because I am a mode of it. I
      know of no other existence. I know of no existence but that existence of
      which I am a mode. I hold it to be capable of producing every effect. It
      is for the man who alleges that there is another, to prove it. I know of
      one existence. I do not endeavor to demonstrate to you my existence, it
      needs no demonstration&mdash;I am My existence is undeniable. I am
      speaking to you You are conscious of my existence. You and I are not
      separate entities, but modes of the same existence. We take cognizance of
      the existence which is around us and in us, and which is the existence of
      which we are modes. Of the one existence we are certain. It is for those
      who affirm that the universe is "matter," and who affirm that there also
      exists "spirit," to remember that they admit the one existence I seek to
      prove, and that the onus lies on them to demonstrate a second existence&mdash;in
      fact, to prove there is the other existence which they term spiritual.
      There can not exist two different substances or existences having the same
      attributes, or qualities. There can not be two existences of the same
      essence, having different attributes, because it is by the attributes
      alone that we can distinguish the existences. We can only judge of the
      substance by its modes. We may find a variety of modes of the same
      substance, and we shall find points of union which help to identify them,
      the one with the other&mdash;the link which connects them with the great
      whole. We can only judge of the existence of which we are a part (in
      consequence of our peculiar organization) under the form of a continuous
      chain of causes and effects&mdash;each effect a cause to the effect it
      precedes, each cause an effect of the causative influence which heralded
      its advent. The remote links of that line are concealed by the darkness of
      the far off past. Nay, more than this, the mightiest effort of mind can
      never say, <i>This is the first cause</i>. Weakness and ignorance have
      said it&mdash;but why? To cloak their weakness, to hide their ignorance.
      Knaves have said it&mdash;but why? To give scope to their cunning, and to
      enable them to say to the credulous, "Thus far shalt thou go and no
      farther." The termination is in the as yet unknowable future; and I ask
      you, presumptuous men, who dare to tell me of God and soul, of matter and
      creation&mdash;when possessed you the power to sunder links of that great
      chain and write, "In the beginning?" I deny that by the mightiest effort
      of the strongest intellect man can ever say of any period, at this point
      substance began to be&mdash;before this existence was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Has man a soul? You who tell me he has a soul, a soul independent of
      material conditions, I ask you how it is that these immortal souls strive
      with one another to get mortal benefits? Has man a soul? If man's soul is
      not subject to material conditions, why do I find knavish souls?&mdash;Why
      slavish souls?&mdash;tyrannous souls? Your doctrine that man has a soul
      prevents him from rising. When you tell him that his soul is not
      improvable by material conditions, you prevent him from making himself
      better than he is. Man's intelligence is a consequence of his
      organization. Organization is improvable, the intelligence becomes more
      powerful as the organization is fully developed, and the conditions which
      surround man are made more pure. And the man will become higher, truer,
      and better when he knows that his intelligence is an attribute, like other
      attributes, capable of development, susceptible of deterioration, he will
      strive to effect the first and to guard against the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look at the number of people putting power into the hands of one man,
      because he is a lord&mdash;surely they have no souls. See the mass
      cringing to a wretched idol&mdash;surely these have no souls. See men
      forming a pyramid of which the base is a crushed and worn-out people, and
      the apex a church, a throne, a priest, a king, and the frippery of a creed&mdash;have
      those men souls? Society should not be such a pyramid, it should be one
      brotherly circle, in which men should be linked together by a
      consciousness that they are only happy so linked, conscious that when the
      chain is broken, then the society and her peace is destroyed. What we
      teach is not that man has a soul apart and independent of the body, but
      that he has an ability, an intelligence, an attribute of his body, capable
      of development, improvable, more useful, according as he elevates himself
      and his fellows. Give up blind adhesion to creeds and priests, strive to
      think and follow out in action the result of your thoughts. Each mental
      struggle is an enlargement of your mind, an addition to your brain power,
      an increase of your soul&mdash;the only soul you have.

    <h2>
      LABOR'S PRAYER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Give us this day our daily bread" is the entreaty addressed by the tiller
      of the soil to the "Our Father," who has promised to answer prayer. And
      what answer cometh from heaven to this the bread winner's petition? Walk
      among the cotton workers of Lancashire, the cloth-weavers of Yorkshire,
      the Durham pitmen, the Staffordshire puddlers, the Cornish miners, the
      London dock laborers, go anywhere where hands are roughened with toil,
      where foreheads are bedewed with sweat of work, and see the Lord's
      response to the prayer, the father's answer to his children! The only
      bread they get is the bread they take; in their hard struggle for
      life-sustenance the loaves come but slowly, and heaven adds not a crust,
      even though the worker be hungry, when he rises from his toil-won meal.
      Not even the sight of pale-faced wife, and thin forms of half-starved
      infants can move to generosity the Ruler of the world. The laborer may
      pray, but, if work be scant and wages low, he pines to death while
      praying. His prayer gives no relief, and misery's answer is the mocking
      echo to his demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said by many a pious tongue that God helps the poor; the
      wretchedness of some of their hovel houses, found alas! too often, in the
      suburbs of our wealthiest cities, grimy black, squalid, and miserable; the
      threadbare raggedness of their garments; the unwholesomeness of the food
      they eat; the poisoned air they breathe in their narrow wynds and filthy
      alleys; all these tell how much God helps the poor. Do you want to see how
      God helps the poor? go into any police court when some little child-thief
      is brought up for hearing; see him shoeless, with ragged trousers,
      threadbare, grimy, vest hardly hanging to his poor body, shirt that seems
      as though it never could have been white, skin dull brown with dirt, hair
      innocent of comb or brush, eye ignorantly, sullenly-defiant, yet downcast;
      born poor, born wretched, born in ignorance, educated among criminals,
      crime the atmosphere in which he moved; and society his nurse and creator,
      is now virtuously aghast at the depravity of this its own neglected
      nursling, and a poor creature whom God alone hath helped. Go where the
      weakly wife in a narrow room huddles herself and little children day after
      day; and where the husband crowds in to lie down at night; they are poor
      and honest, but their honesty bars not the approach of disease, fever,
      sorrow, death&mdash;God helps not the line of health to their poor wan
      cheeks. Go to the county workhouse in which is temporarily housed the
      wornout farm laborer, who, while, strength enough remained, starved
      through weary years with wife and several children on eight shillings per
      week&mdash;it is thus God helps the poor. And the poor are taught to pray
      for a continuance of this help, and to be thankful and content to pray
      that to-morrow may be like to-day, thankful that yesterday was no worse
      than it was, and content that to-day is as good as it is. Are there many
      repining at their miseries, the preacher, with gracious intonation,
      answers rebukingly that God, in his wisdom, has sent these troubles upon
      them as chastisement for their sins. So, says the church, all are sinners,
      rich its well as poor; but rich sinners feel that the chastising rod is
      laid more lightly on their backs than it is upon those of their meaner
      brethren. Weekday and Sunday it is the same contrast; one wears fustian,
      the other broadcloth; one prepares for heaven in the velvet cushioned pew,
      the other on the wooden benches of the free seats. In heaven it will be
      different&mdash;all there above are to wear crowns of gold and fine linen,
      and, therefore, here below the poor man is to be satisfied with the state
      of life into which it has pleased God to call him. The pastor, who tells
      him this, looks upon the laborer as an inferior animal, and the laborer by
      force of habit regards the landowner and peer, who patronizes his
      endeavors, as a being of a superior order. Is there no new form of prayer
      that labor might be taught to utter, no other power to which his petition
      might be addressed? Prayer to the unknown for aid gives no strength to the
      prayer. In each beseeching he loses dignity and self-reliance, he trusts
      to he knows not what, for an answer which cometh he knows not when, and
      mayhap may never come at all. Let labor pray in the future in another
      fashion and at another altar. Let laborer pray to laborer that each may
      know labor's rights, and be able to fulfill labor's duties. The size of
      the loaf of daily bread must depend on the amount of the daily wages, and
      the laborer must pray for better wages. But his prayer must take the form
      of earnest, educated endeavor to obtain the result desired. Let workmen,
      instead of praying to God in their distress, ask one another why are wages
      low? how can wages be raised? can we raise our own wages? having raised
      them, can we keep them fixed at the sum desired? What causes produce a
      rise and fall in wages? are high wages beneficial to the laborer? These
      are questions the pulpit has no concern with. The reverend pastor will
      tell you that the "wages of sin is death," and will rail against "filthy
      lucre;" but he has no inclination for answering the queries here
      propounded. Why are wages low? Wages are low because the wage-winners
      crowd too closely. Wages are low because too many seek to share one fund.
      Wages are lower still because the laborer fights against unfair odds; the
      laws of the country, overriding the laws of humanity, have been enacted
      without the laborer's consent, although his obedience to them is enforced.
      The fund is unfairly distributed as well as too widely divided. Statutes
      are gradually being modified, and the working man may hope for ampler
      justice from the employer in the immediate future than was possible in the
      past, but high and healthy wages depend on the working man himself. Wages
      can be raised by the work-ing classes exercising a moderate degree of
      caution in increasing their numbers. Wages must increase when capital
      increases more rapidly than population, and it is the duty of the working
      man, therefore, to take every reasonable precaution to check the increase
      of population and to accelerate the augmentation of capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can working-men, by combination, permanently raise the rate of wages? One
      gentleman presiding at a meeting of the National Association for the
      Promotion of Social Science for the discussion of the labor question, very
      fairly said, "It is not in the power of the men alone, or of the masters
      alone, or of both combined, to say what shall be the amount of wages at
      any particular time in any trade or country. The men and the masters are,
      at most, competitors for the division, at a certain rate, of a certain
      fund, provided by [themselves and] others&mdash;that is, by the consumers.
      If that fund is small, no device can make the rate of profit or rate of
      wages higher." This is in theory quite correct, if it means that no device
      can make the total divisible greater than it is, but not if it refers to
      the increase of profit or wages by partial distribution. In practice,
      although it is true that if the fund be small and the seekers to share it
      be many, the quotient to each must be necessarily very small, yet it is
      also true that a few of the competitors&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the capitalists,
      may and do absorb for their portions of profits an improper and unfairly
      large amount, thus still further reducing the wretchedly small pittance in
      any case receivable by the mass of laborers. It is warmly contended that
      the capitalist and laborer contend for division of the fund appropriable
      in fair and open field; that the capitalist has his money to employ, the
      man his labor to sell; that if workmen are in excess of the capitalist's
      requirements, so that the laborer has to supplicate for employment, wages
      can not rise, and will probably fall; but that if, on the contrary,
      capital has need to invite additional laborers, then wages must rise. That
      is the law of supply and demand brought prominently forward. In great part
      this is true, but it is not true that capital and labor compete in fair
      and open field, any more than it is true that an iron-clad war vessel,
      with heavy ordnance, would compete in fair field with a wooden frigate,
      equipped with the material in use thirty years ago. Capital is
      gold-plated, and carries too many guns for unprotected labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intelligent capitalist makes the laws affecting master and servant,
      which the uneducated laborer must obey, but has no effective voice to
      alter. The capitalist forms the government of the country, which in turn
      protects capital against labor; this government the laborer must sustain,
      and dares not modify. The capitalist does combine, and has combined, and
      the result of this combination has been an unfair appropriation of the
      divisible fund. Why should not the laborer combine also? The answer is
      truly that no combination of workmen can increase the rate of wages, if at
      the same time the number of laborers increases more rapidly than the
      capital out of which their wages must be paid. But the men may combine to
      instruct one another in the laws of political economy; they may combine to
      apply their knowledge of those laws to the contracts between employer and
      employed. They may combine to compel the repeal of unjust enactments under
      which an unfair distribution of the labor fund is not only possible but
      certain. Organizations of laborers are, therefore, wise and necessary; the
      object of such organizations should be the permanent elevation and
      enfranchisement of the members. No combination of workmen, which merely
      dictates a temporary cessation from labor, can ultimately and permanently
      benefit the laborer; while it certainly immediately injures him and
      deteriorates his condition, making his home wretched, his family paupers.
      Nor can even co-operative combination, praiseworthy as it certainly is, to
      procure for the laborer a larger share of the profits of his labor
      permanently benefit him, except in so far that temporarily alleviating his
      condition, and giving him leisure for study, it enables him to educate
      himself; unless, at the same time, the co-operator is conscious that the
      increase or reduction in the amount of wages depends entirely on the ratio
      of relation preserved between population and its means of subsistence, the
      former always having a tendency to increase more rapidly than the latter.
      It is with the problem of too many mouths for too little bread that the
      laborer has really to deal: if he must pray, it should be for more bread
      and for fewer mouths. The answer often given by the workman himself to the
      advocate of Malthusian views is, that the world is wide enough for all,
      that there are fields yet unplowed broad enough to bear more corn than man
      at present could eat, and that there is neither too little food nor are
      there too many mouths; that there is, in fact, none of that
      over-population with which it is sought to affright the working man.
      Over-population in the sense that the whole world is too full to contain
      its habitants, or that it will ever become too full to contain them, is
      certainly a fallacy, but overpopulation is a lamentable truth in its
      relative sense. We find evidences of over-population in every old country
      of the world. The pest of over-population is the existence of poverty,
      squalor, wretchedness, disease, ignorance, misery, and crime. Low rate of
      wages, and food dear, here you have two certain indices of relative
      over-population. Wages depending on the demand for and supply of laborers,
      wherever wages are low it is a certain sign that there are too many
      candidates for employment in that phase of the labor market. The increased
      cost of production of food, and its consequent higher price, also mark
      that the cultivation has been forced, by the numbers of the people to
      descend to less productive soils. Poverty is the test and result of
      over-population.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not against some possible increase of their numbers, which may
      produce possibly greater affliction, that the working men are entreated to
      agitate. It is against the existing evils which afflict their ranks, evils
      alleged by sound students of political economy to have already resulted
      from inattention to the population question, that the energies of the
      people are sought to be directed, The operation of the law of population
      has been for centuries entirely ignored by those who have felt its adverse
      influence most severely. It is only during the last thirty years that any
      of the working classes have turned their attention to the question; and
      only during the last few years that it has to any extent been discussed
      among them. Yet all the prayers that labor ever uttered since the first
      breath of human life, have not availed so much for human happiness as will
      the earnest examination by one generation of this, the greatest of all
      social questions, the root of all political problems, the foundation of
      all civil progress. Poor, man must be wretched. Poor, he must be ignorant.
      Poor, he must be criminal; and poor he must be till the cause of poverty
      has been ascertained by the poor man himself and its cure planned by the
      poor man's brain, and effected by the poor man's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside his own rank none can save the poor. Others may show him the
      abyss, but he must avoid its dangerous brink himself. Others may point out
      to him the chasm, but he must build his own bridge over. Labor's prayer
      must be to labor's head for help from labor's hand to strike the blow that
      severs labor's chain, and terminates the too long era of labor's
      suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last few years our daily papers, and various periodicals,
      magazines, and reviews have been more frequently, and much less partially,
      devoted than of old to the discussion of questions relating to the
      laborer's condition, and the means of ameliorating it. In the Legislative
      Assembly debates have taken place which would have been impossible fifty
      years since. Works on political economy are now more easily within the
      reach of the working man than they were some years ago. People's editions
      are now published of treatises on political economy which half a century
      back the people were unable to read. It is now possible for the laborer,
      and it is the laborer's duty, to make himself master of the laws which
      govern the production and distribution of wealth. Undoubtedly there is
      much grievous wrong in the mode of distribution of wealth, by which the
      evils that afflict the poorest stragglers are often specially and tenfold
      aggravated. The monopoly of land, the serf state of the laborer, are
      points requiring energetic agitation. The grave and real question is,
      however, that which lies at the root of all, the increase of wealth as
      against the increase of those whom it subsists. The leaders of the great
      trades unions of the country, if they really desire to permanently
      increase the happiness of the classes among whom they exercise influence,
      can speedily promote this object by encouraging their members to discuss
      freely the relations of labor to capital; not moving in one groove, as if
      labor and capital were necessarily antagonistic, and that therefore labor
      must always have rough-armed hand to protect itself from the attacks of
      capital; but, taking new ground, to inquire if labor and capital are bound
      to each other by any and what ties, ascertaining if the share of the
      laborer in the capital fund depends, except so far as affected by
      inequality in distribution, on the proportion between the number of
      laborers and the amount of the fund. The discussing, examining, and
      dealing generally with these topics, would necessarily compel the working
      man to a more correct appreciation of his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any such doctrine as that "the poor shall never cease out of the land;" or
      that we are to be content with the station in life into which it has
      pleased God to call us; or that we are to ask and we shall receive, must
      no longer avail. Schiller most effectively answers the advocates of
      prayer:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Help, Lord, help!
     Look with pity down!
     A paternoster pray;
     What God does, that is justly done,
     His grace endures for aye."

     "Oh, mother! empty mockery,
     God hath not justly dealt by me:
     Have I not begged and prayed in vain;
     What boots it now to pray again?"
</pre>
    <p>
      Labor's only and effective prayer must be in life action for its own
      redemption; action founded on thought, crude thought, and sometimes erring
      at first, but ultimately developed into useful thinking, by much patient
      experimenting for the right and true.

      POVERTY: ITS EFFECTS ON THE POLITICAL CONDITION OF THE PEOPLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Political Economy does not itself instruct how to make a nation rich, but
      whoever would be qualified to judge of the means of making a nation rich
      must first be a political economist."&mdash;John Stuart Mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The object of political economy is to secure the means of subsistence of
      all the inhabitants, to obviate every circumstance which might render this
      precarious, to provide everything necessary for supplying the wants of
      society, and to employ the inhabitants so as to make the interests accord
      with their supplying each other's wants."&mdash;Sir James Stewart.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one occasion in the world's history, a people rose searching for
      upright life, who had previously, for several generations, depressed by
      poverty and its attendant hand-maidens of misery, prowled hunger-striken
      and disconsolate, stooping and stumbling through the byways of existence.
      A mighty revolution resulted in much rough justice and some brutal
      vengeance, much rude right, and some terrific wrong. Among the writers who
      have since narrated the history of this people's struggle, some penmen
      have been assiduous and hasty to search for, and chronicle the errors, and
      have even not hesitated to magnify the crimes of the rebels; while they
      have been slow to recognize the previous demoralizing tendency of the
      system rebelled against. In this pamphlet it is proposed to very briefly
      deal with the state of the people in France immediately prior to the grand
      convulsion which destroyed the Bastile Monarchy, and set a glorious
      example of the vindication of the rights of man against opposition the
      most formidable that can be conceived; believing that even in this slight
      illustration of the condition of the masses in France who sought to erect
      on the ruins of arbitrary power the glorious edifice of civil and
      religious liberty, an answer may be found to the question: "What is the
      effect of poverty on the political condition of the people."
    </p>
    <p>
      In taking the instance of France, it is not that the writer for one moment
      imagines that poverty is a word without meaning in our own lands. The
      clamming factory hands in the Lancanshire valleys, the distressed ribbon
      weavers of Conventry, and the impoverished laborers in various parts of
      Ireland and Scotland would be able to give us a definition of the word
      fearful in its distinctness. But in England poverty is happily partial,
      while in France in the eighteenth century poverty was universal outside
      the palaces of the nobles and the mansions of the church, where luxury,
      voluptuousness, and effeminacy were regnant. In the seventeenth and
      eighteenth centuries travelers in France could learn from "the sadness,
      the solitude, the miserable poverty, the dismal nakedness of the empty
      cottages, and the starving, ragged population, how much men could endure
      without dying." On the one side a discontented, wretched, hungry mass of
      tax-providing slaves, and on the other a rapacious, pampered, licentious,
      spendthrift monarchy. This culminated in the refusal of the laborers to
      cultivate the fertile soil because, the tax-gatherer's rapacity left an
      insufficient remnant to provide the cultivator with the merest necessaries
      of life. Then followed "uncultivated fields, unpeopled villages, and
      houses dropping to decay;" the great cities&mdash;as Paris, Lyons, and
      Bordeaux&mdash;crowded with begging skeletons, frightful in their squallid
      disease and loathsome aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even after the National Assembly had passed some measures of temporary
      alleviation, the distress in Paris itself was so great that at the
      gratuitious distributions of bread "old people have been seen to expire
      with their hand stretched out to receive the loaf, and women waiting in
      their turn in front of the baker's shop were prematurely delivered of dead
      children in the open streets." The great mass of the people were as
      ignorant as they were poor; were ignorant indeed because they were poor.
      Ignorance is the pauper's inalienable heritage. When the struggle is for
      the means of subsistence, and these are only partially obtained, there is
      little hope for the luxury of a leisure hour in which other emotions can
      be cultivated than those of the mere desires for food and rest&mdash;sole
      results of the laborious monotonousness of machine work; a round of toil
      and sleep closing in death&mdash;the only certain refuge for the worn out
      laborer. Without the opportunity afforded by the possession of more than
      will satisfy the immediate wants, there can be little or no culture of the
      mental faculties. The toiler badly paid and ill-fed, is separated from the
      thinker. Nobly-gifted, highly-cultured though the poet may be, his poesy
      has no charms for the father to whom one hour's leisure means short food
      for his hungry children clamoring for bread. The picture gallery, replete
      with the finest works of our greatest masters, is forbidden ground to the
      pitman, the plowman, the poor pariahs to whom the conceptions of the
      highest art-treasures are impossible. The beauties of nature are almost
      equally inaccessible to the dwellers in the narrow lanes of great cities.
      Out of your narrow wynds in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and on to the moor and
      mountain-side, ye poor, and breathe the pure life-renewing breezes. Not
      so; the moors are for the sportsmen and peers, not peasants; and a Scotch
      Duke&mdash;emblem of the worst vices of a corrupt and selfish, but
      fast-decaying House of Lords&mdash;closes miles of heather against the
      pedestrian's foot. But even this paltry oppression is unneeded. Duke
      Despicable is in unholy alliance with King Poverty, who mocks at the poor
      mother and her wretched, ragged family, when from the garret or cellar in
      a great Babylon wilderness they set out to find green fields and new life.
      Work days are sacred to bread, and clothes, and rent; hunger, inclement
      weather, and pressing landlord forbid the study of nature 'twixt Monday
      morn and Saturday night, and on Sunday God's ministers require to teach a
      weary people how to die, as if the lesson were not unceasingly inculcated
      in their incessant toil. Oh! horrid mockery; men need teaching how to
      live. According to religionists, this world's bitter misery is a dark and
      certain preface, "just published," to a volume of eternal happiness, which
      for 2,000 years has been advertised as in the press and ready for
      publication, but which after all may never appear. And notwithstanding
      that every-day misery is so very potent, mankind seem to heed it but very
      little. The second edition of a paper containing the account of a battle
      in which some 5,000 were killed and 10,000 wounded, is eagerly perused,
      but the battle in which poverty kills and maims hundreds of thousands, is
      allowed to rage without the uplifting of a weapon against the common
      enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor in France were awakened by Rousseau's startling declaration that
      property was spoliation, they knew they had been spoiled, the logic of the
      stomach was conclusive, empty bellies and aching brains were the
      predecessors of a revolution which sought vengeance when justice was
      denied, but which full-stomached and empty-headed Tories of later days
      have calumniated and denounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Warned by the past, ought we not to-day to give battle to that curse of
      all old countries&mdash;poverty? The fearful miseries of the want of food
      and leisure which the poor have to endure are such as to seriously hinder
      their political enfranchisement. Those who desire that men and women shall
      have their rights of citizens, should be conscious how low the poor are
      trampled down, and how incapable poverty renders them for the performance
      of the duties of citizenship. So that the question of political freedom is
      really determined by the wealth or poverty of the masses; to this extent,
      at any rate, that a poverty-stricken people must necessarily, after that
      state of pauperism has existed for several generations, be an ignorant and
      enslaved people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem is, how to remove poverty, as it is only by the removal of
      poverty that the political emancipation of the nation can be rendered
      possible. It has been ascertained that the average food of the
      agricultural laborer in England is about half that alloted by the jail
      dietary to sustain criminal life. So that the peasant who builds and
      guards his master's haystack gets worse fed and worse lodged than the
      incendiary convicted for burning it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      How can this poverty be removed and prevented?
    </p>
    <p>
      I quote the reply from one who has written most elaborately in elucidation
      of the views of Malthus and Mill: "There is but one possible mode of
      preventing any evil&mdash;namely, to seek for and remove its cause. The
      cause of low wages, or in other words of Poverty, is overpopulation; that
      is, the existence of too many people in proportion to the food, of too
      many laborers in proportion to the capital. It is of the very first
      importance that the attention of all who seek to remove poverty should
      never be diverted from this great truth. The disproportion between the
      numbers and the food is the <i>only real cause</i> of social poverty.
      Individual cases of poverty may be produced by individual misconduct, such
      as drunknness, ignorance, laziness, or disease; but these and all other
      accidental influences must be wholly thrown out of the question in
      considering the permanent cause, and aiming at the prevention of poverty.
      Drunknness and ignorance, moreover, are far more frequently the <i>effect</i>
      than the cause of poverty. Population and food, like two runners of
      unequal swiftness chained together, advance side by side; but the ratio of
      increase of the former is so immensely superior to that of the latter,
      that it is necessarily greatly <i>checked</i>; and the checks are of
      course either more deaths or fewer births&mdash;that is, either positive
      or preventive."
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless the <i>necessity</i> of the preventive or positive checks to
      population be perceived; unless it be clearly seen, that they must operate
      in one form, if not in another; and that <i>though individuals may escape
      them, the race can not</i>; human society is a hopeless and insoluble
      riddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quoting John Stuart Mill, the writer from whom the foregoing extracts have
      been made, proceeds:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The great object of statesmanship should be to raise the habitual
      standard of comfort among the working classes, and to bring them into such
      a position as shows them most clearly that their welfare depends upon
      themselves. For this purpose he advises that there should be, first, an
      extended scheme of national emigration, so as to produce a striking and
      sudden improvement in the condition of the laborers left at home, and
      raise their standard of comfort; also that the population truths should be
      disseminated as widely as possible, so that a powerful public feeling
      should be awakened among the working classes against undue procreation on
      the part of any individual among them&mdash;a feeling which could not fail
      greatly to influence individual conduct; and also that we should use every
      endeavor to get rid of the present system of labor&mdash;namely, that of
      employers, and employed, and adopt to a great extent that of independent
      or associated industry. His reason for this is, that a hired laborer, who
      has no personal interest in the work he is engaged in, is generally
      reckless and without foresight, living from hand to mouth, and exerting
      little control over his powers of procreation; whereas the laborer who has
      a personal stake in his work, and the feeling of independence and
      self-reliance which the possession of property gives, as, for instance,
      the peasant proprietor, or member of a copartnership, has far stronger
      motives for self-restraint, and can see much more clearly the evil effects
      of having a large family."
    </p>
    <p>
      The end in view in all this is the attainment of a greater amount of
      happiness for humankind. The rendering life more worth the living, by
      distributing more equally than at present its love, its beauties, and its
      charms. In one of his most recent publications, Mr. John Stuart Mill
      observes:
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a world in which there is so much to interest, so much to enjoy, and
      so much also to correct and improve, every one who has a moderate amount
      of moral and intellectual requisites is capable of an existence which may
      be called enviable; and unless such a person, through bad laws, or
      subjection to the will of others, is denied the liberty to use the sources
      of happiness within his reach, he will not fail to find tins enviable
      existence, if he escape the positive evils of life, the great sources of
      physical and mental suffering, such as indigence, disease, and the
      unkindness, worthlessness, or premature loss of objects of affection. Yet
      no one whose opinion deserves a moment's consideration, can doubt that
      most of the great positive evils of the world are in themselves removable,
      and will, if human affairs continue to improve, be in the end reduced
      within narrow limits. Poverty, in any sense implying suffering, may be
      completely extinguished by the wisdom of society, combined with the good
      sense and providence of individuals. Even that most intractable of
      enemies, disease, may be indefinitely reduced in dimensions by good
      physical and moral education and proper control of noxious influences,
      while the progress of science holds out a promise for the future of still
      more direct conquests over this detestable foe."
    </p>
    <p>
      In a former pamphlet, "Jesus, Shelly, and Malthus," the reader's attention
      was entreated to this grave question. In a few pages it is impossible to
      do more than erect a fingerpost to point out a possible road to a given
      end. To attempt in a narrow compass to give complete details, would be as
      unwise as it would be unavailing. My desire is rather to provoke
      discussion among the masses than to obtain willing auditors among the few,
      and I affirm it, therefore, as a proposition which I am prepared to
      support, "That the political conditions of the people can never be
      permanently reformed until the cause of poverty has been discovered and
      the evil itself prevented and removed."

    <h2>
      WHY DO MEN STARVE?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Why is it that human beings are starved to death, in a wealthy country
      like England, with its palaces, its cathedrals, and its abbeys; with its
      grand mansions, and luxurious dwellings, with its fine inclosed parks, and
      strictly guarded preserves; with its mills, mines, and factories; with its
      enormous profits to the capitalist; and with its broad acres and great
      rent rolls to the landholder? The feet that men, old, young, and in the
      prime of life; that women, and that children, do so die, is indisputable.
      The paragraph in the daily journals, headed "Death from Starvation," or
      "Another Death from Destitution," is no uncommon one to the eyes of the
      careful reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a newspaper of one day, December 24, 1864, may be read the verdict of a
      London jury that "the deceased, Robert Bloom, died from the mortal effects
      of effusion on the brain and disease of the lungs, arising from natural
      causes, but the said death was accelerated by destitution, and by living
      in an ill-ventilated room, and in a court wanting in sanitary
      requirements;" and the verdict of another jury, presided over by the very
      Coroner who sat on the last case, "that the deceased, Mary Hale, was found
      dead in a certain room from the mortal effects of cold and starvation;" as
      also the history of a poor wanderer from the Glasgow City Poor House found
      dead in the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      In London, the hive of the world, with its merchant millionaires, even
      under the shadow of the wealth pile, starvation is as busy as if in the
      most wretched and impoverished village; busy, indeed, not always striking
      the victim so obtrusively that the coroner's inquest shall preserve a
      record of the fact, but more often busy quietly, in the wretched court and
      narrow lane, up in the garret, and down in the cellar, stealing by slow
      degrees the life of the poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why does it happen that Christian London, with its magnificent houses for
      God, has so many squalid holes for the poor? Christianity from its
      thousand pulpits teaches, "Ask and it shall be given to you," "who if his
      son ask bread, will he give him a stone?" yet with much prayer the bread
      is too frequently not enough, and it is, alas! not seldom that the prayer
      for bread gets the answer in the stone of the paved street, where he lays
      him down to die. The prayer of the poor outcast is answered by hunger,
      misery, disease, crime and death, and yet the Bible says, "Blessed be ye
      poor."' Ask the orthodox clergyman why men starve, why men are poor and
      miserable; he will tell you that it is God's will; that it is a punishment
      for man's sins. And so long as men are content to believe that it is God's
      will that the majority of humankind should have too little happiness, so
      long will it be impossible effectually to get them to listen to the answer
      to this great question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men starve because the great bulk of them are ignorant of the great law of
      population, the operation of which controls their existence and determines
      its happiness or misery. They starve because pulpit teachers have taught
      them for centuries to be content with the state of life in which it has
      pleased God to call them, instead of teaching them how to extricate
      themselves from the misery, degradation, and ignorance which a continuance
      of poverty entails.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men starve because the teachers have taught heaven instead of earth, the
      next world instead of this. It is now generally admitted by those who have
      investigated the subject that there is a tendency in all animated life to
      increase beyond the nourishment nature produces. In the human race, there
      is a constant endeavor on the part of its members to increase beyond the
      means of subsistence within their reach. The want of food to support this
      increase operates, in the end, as a positive obstacle to the further
      spread of population, and men are starved because the great mass of them
      have neglected to listen to one of nature's clearest teachings. The
      unchecked increase of population is in a geometrical ratio, the increase
      of food for their subsistence is in an arithmetical ratio. That is, while
      humankind would increase in proportion as 1, 2, 4, 8,16, 32, 64, 128, 256,
      food would only increase as 1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The more the mouths
      the less the proportion of food. While the restraint to an increase of
      population is thus a want of food, and starvation is the successful
      antagonist of struggling human life, it is seldom that this obstacle
      operates immediately&mdash;its dealing is more often indirectly against
      its victims. Those who die of actual famine are few indeed compared with
      those who die from various forms of disease, induced by scarcity of the
      means of subsistence. If any of my readers doubt this, their doubts may be
      removed by a very short series of visits to the wretched homes of the
      paupers of our great cities. Suicide is the refuge mainly of those who are
      worn out in a bitter, and, to them, a hopeless struggle against
      accumulated ills. Disease, suffering, and misery are the chief causes of
      the prevalence of suicide in our country, and suicide is therefore one
      form, although comparatively minute, in which the operation of the law of
      population may be traced.
    </p>
    <p>
      From dread of the pangs of poverty, men, women, and children are driven to
      unwholesome occupations, which destroy not only the health of the man and
      woman actually employed, but implant the germs of physical disease in
      their offspring. A starving woman seeking food mixes white lead with oil
      and turpentine for a paltry pittance, which provides bare existence for
      her and those who share it; in a few weeks, she is so diseased she can
      work no longer, and the hospital and grave in turn receive her. Men and
      women are driven to procure bread by work in lead mines; they rapidly dig
      their own graves, and not alone themselves, but their wretched offspring,
      are death-stricken as the penalty; the lead poisons the blood of parent
      and child alike. Young women and children work at artificial
      flower-making, and soon their occupation teaches that Scheele's and
      Schweenfurth green, bright and pleasing colors to the eye, are death's
      darts too often fatally aimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occupation may be objected to as unhealthy; but the need for food is
      great, and the woman's or child's wages, wretchedly little though they
      are, yet help to fill the mouths at home: so the wage is taken till the
      worker dies. Here, again, the checks to an increase of population all stop
      short of starvation&mdash;the victims are poisoned instead of starved. So
      where some forty or fifty young girls are crowded into a badly ventilated
      work-room, not large enough for half the number, from early in the morning
      till even near midnight, when orders press; or in some work-room where
      slop clothes are made, and twenty-five tailors are huddled together in a
      little parlor scarce wide enough for three&mdash;they work to live, and
      die slowly while they work. They are not starved, but is this sort of
      asphyxiation much better? The poor, are not only driven to unhealthy, but
      also to noisome, dwellings. There are in London, Liverpool, Glasgow,
      Edinburgh, Manchester, and other large cities, fearful alleys, with
      wretched houses, and small ill-ventilated rooms, each room containing a
      family, the individuals of which are crowded together under conditions so
      wretched that disease, and often speedy death, is the only possible
      result. In the East of London, ten, eleven, and, in some cases, fourteen
      persons have been found sleeping in one wretched little room. Is it
      wonderful that some of these misery-stricken ones die before they have
      time to starve? From poverty the mother, obliged to constantly work that
      the miserable pittance she gets may yield enough to sustain bare life, is
      unable properly to nurse and care for baby-child, and often quick death,
      or slow but certain disease, ending ultimately in the grave, is the
      result.

      The poor live by wages. Wages popularly signify the amount of money earned
      by the laborer in a given time; but the real value of the money-wages is
      the amount in quantity and quality of the means of subsistence which the
      laborer can purchase with that money. Wages may be nominally high, but
      really low, if the food and commodities to be purchased are, at the same
      time, dear in price. An undue increase of population reduces wages in more
      than one way; it reduces them in effect, if not in nominal amount, by
      increasing the price of the food to be purchased; and it also reduces the
      nominal amount, because the nominal amount depends on the amount of
      capital at disposal for employ, and the number of laborers seeking
      employment. No remedies for low wages, no scheme for the prevention and
      removal of poverty, can ever be efficacious until they operate on and
      through the minds and habits of the masses.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not from rich men that the poor must hope for deliverance from
      starvation. It is not to charitable associations the wretched must appeal.
      Temporary alleviation of the permanent evil is the best that can be hoped
      for from such aids. It is by the people that the people must be saved.
      Measures which increase the dependence of the poor on charitable aid can
      only temporarily benefit one portion of the laboring class while injuring
      another in the same proportion; and charity, if carried far, must
      inevitably involve the recipients in ultimate ruin and degradation by
      destroying their mutual self-reliance. The true way to improve the worker,
      in all cases short of actual want of the necessaries of life, is to throw
      him entirely on his own resources, but at the same time to teach him how
      he may augment those resources to the utmost. It is only by educating the
      ignorant poor to a consciousness of the happiness possible to them, as a
      result of their own exertions, that you can induce them effectually to
      strive for it. But, alas! as Mr. Mill justly observes, "Education is not
      compatible with extreme poverty. It is impossible effectually to teach an
      indigent population." The time occupied in the bare struggle to exist
      leaves but few moments and fewer opportunities for mental cultivation to
      the very poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question of wages and their relation to capital and population, a
      question which interests a poor man so much, is one on which he formerly
      hardly ever thought at all, and on which even now he thinks much too
      seldom. It is necessary to impress on the laborer that the rate of wages
      depends on the proportion between population and capital. If population
      increases without an increase of capital, wages fall; the number or
      competitors in the labor market being greater, and the fund to provide for
      them not having increased proportionately, and, if capital increases
      without an increase of population, wages rise. Many efforts have been made
      to increase wages, but none of them can be permanently successful which do
      not include some plan for preventing a too rapid increase of laborers.
      Population has a tendency to increase, and has increased faster than
      capital; this is evidenced by the poor and miserable condition of the
      great body of the people in most of the old countries of the world, a
      condition which can only be accounted for upon one of two suppositions,
      either that there is a natural tendency in population to increase faster
      than capital, or that capital has, by some means, been prevented from
      increasing as rapidly as it might have done. That population has such a
      tendency to increase that, unchecked, it would double itself in a small
      number of years&mdash;say twenty-five&mdash;is a proposition which most
      writers of any merit concur in, and which may be easily proven. In some
      instances, the increase has been even still more rapid. That capital has
      not increased sufficiently is evident from the existing state of society.
      But that it could increase under any circumstances with the same rapidity
      as is possible to population is denied. The increase of capital is
      retarded by an obstacle which does not exist in the case of population..
      The augmentation of capital is painful. It can only be effected by
      abstaining from immediate enjoyment. In the case of augmentation of
      population precisely the reverse obtains. There the temporary and
      immediate pleasure is succeeded by the permanent pain. The only possible
      mode of raising wages permanently, and effectually benefiting the poor, is
      by so educating them that they shall be conscious that their welfare
      depends upon the exercise of a greater control over their passions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In penning this brief paper, my desire has been to provoke among the
      working classes a discussion and careful examination of the teachings of
      political economy, as propounded by Mr. J. S. Mill and those other able
      men who, of late, have devoted themselves to elaborating and popularizing
      the doctrines enunciated by Malthus. While I am glad to find that there
      are some among the masses who are inclined to preach and put in practice
      the teachings of the Malthusian School of political economists, I know
      that they are yet few in comparison with the great body of the working
      classes who have been taught to look upon the political economist as the
      poor man's foe. It is nevertheless among the working men alone, and, in
      the very ranks of the starvers, that the effort must be made to check
      starvation. The question is again before us: How are men to be prevented
      from starving? Not by strikes, during the continuance of which food is
      scarcer than before. No combinations of workmen can obtain high wages if
      the number of workers is too great. It is not by a mere struggle of class
      against class that the poor man's ills can be cured. The working classes
      can alleviate their own sufferings. They can, by co-operative schemes,
      which have the advantage of being educational in their operation,
      temporarily and partially remedy some of the evils, if not by increasing
      the means of subsistence, at any rate by securing a larger portion of the
      result of labor to the proper sustenance of the laborer. Systems of
      associated industry are of immense benefit to the working classes, not
      alone or so much from the pecuniary improvement they result in, but
      because they develop in each individual a sense of dignity and
      independence which he lacks as a mere hired laborer. They can permanently
      improve their condition by taking such steps as shall prevent too rapid an
      increase of their numbers, and, by thus checking the supply of laborers,
      they will, as capital augments, increase the rate of wages paid to the
      laborer. The steady object of each working man should be to impress on his
      fellow-worker the importance of this subject. Let each point out to his
      neighbor not only the frightful struggle in which a poor man must engage
      who brings up a large family, but also that the result is to place in the
      labor market more claimants tor a share of the fund which has hitherto
      been found insufficient to keep the working classes from death by
      starvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object of this pamphlet will be amply attained if it serve as the
      means of inducing some of the working classes to examine for themselves
      the teachings of Political Economy. All that is at present needed is that
      laboring men and women should be accustomed, both publicly and at home, to
      the consideration and discussion of the views and principles first openly
      propounded by Mr. Malthus, and since elaborated by Mr. Mill and other
      writers. The mere investigation of the subject will of itself serve to
      bring to the notice of the masses many facts hitherto entirely ignored by
      them. All must acknowledge the terrible ills resulting from poverty, and
      all therefore are bound to use their faculties to discover if possible its
      cause and cure. It is more than folly for the working man to permit
      himself to be turned away from the subject by the cry that the Political
      Economists have no sympathy with the poor. If the allegation were true,
      which it is not, it would only afford an additional reason why this
      important science should find students among those who most need aid from
      its teachings.

    <h2>
      THE LAND QUESTION.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      LARGE ESTATES INIMICAL TO THE WELFARE OF THE PEOPLE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Property in land differs from ordinary property. Wealth, which is the
      accumulated result of labor, is sometimes, but not often, accumulated in
      the hands of the laborer, and is more frequently accumulated in the hands
      of some person who has purchased the result of the laborers toil. Such
      personal wealth is capable of indefinite increase; and the exclusive right
      to its disposal is protected in the hands of its possessor, so long as he
      does not avail himself of this legal protection to use the wealth
      mischievously to his fellows. There would be no incentive in the laborer
      to economy, or to increased exertion, unless the State gave him reasonable
      protection in the enjoyment of his savings. Unfortunately, to obtain the
      protection of the authorities, he has in this country to give up an
      unreasonably large portion of his earnings to defray the cost of local and
      imperial Government. During the reign of her present Majesty, imperial
      taxation alone has increased from about £48,000,000 to £73,833,000. The
      State has no right to interfere with a man's daily disposition of his
      personal wealth, merely on the ground that he might have used it more
      advantageously for his fellows. With land it is quite different; it is
      limited in extent, and the portions of it capable of producing food with
      ease to the cultivator are still more limited. Every individual member of
      the commonwealth has an indefeasible interest in the totality of the land,
      and no man ought to assert an absolute freehold in land hostile to the
      interest of his fellow. The land is part of the general soil of the State,
      and should be held subject to the general welfare of the citizens. No man
      has a right so to hold land that his tenure is detrimental to the
      happiness of the dwellers upon it or around it. This principle is already
      recognized in much of our legislation. A man can not say to a railway
      company&mdash;which has obtained the usual compulsory powers of taking
      land&mdash;"You shall not cross my private estate;" the law would answer,
      if he did, by saying, "The railway is for the good of the State; you as an
      individual must give way to the general good, and must lose your land,
      receiving a fair and reasonable money value for it." This principle should
      be applied more widely: and if it be for the good of the commonwealth that
      some of the enormous land monopolies of this country should be broken up,
      no statesman ought to be deterred by the mere dread of interfering with
      the so-called rights of private property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Mill says: "When the 'sacredness of property' is talked of, it should
      always be remembered that any such sacredness does not belong in the same
      degree to landed property. No man made the land. It is the original
      inheritance of the whole species. Its appropriation is wholly a question
      of general expediency. When private property in land is not expedient it
      is unjust." The possession of land involves and carries with it the duty
      of cultivating that land, and, in fact, individual proprietorship of soil
      is only defensible so long as the possessor can show improvement and
      cultivation of the land he holds. To quote again from Mr. John Stuart
      Mill: "The essential principle of property being to assure to all persons
      what they have produced by their labor, and accumulated by their
      abstinence, this principle can not apply to that which is not the produce
      of labor, the raw material of the earth." Mr. Mill urges that property in
      land "is only valid in so far as the proprietor of the land is its
      improver." "In no sound theory of private property was it ever
      contemplated that the proprietor of land should be merely a sinecurist
      quartered upon it." Yet, in England and Wales alone, the landlords who
      received for rent, in the year 1800, £22,500,000, now receive about
      £67,000,000, and for this have no obligation on them to cultivate. The
      holding cultivable land in an uncultivated condition in this overcrowded
      country ought to be made a statutory misdemeanor, the penalty for which
      should be the forfeiture to the State of the land so left uncultivated,
      at, say, a twenty years' purchase of its annual return in the neglected or
      misapplied state in which it was found at the time of conviction. The true
      theory of landholding should be that the State should be the only
      freeholder, all other tenures being limited in character; and cultivation
      ought to be a special condition of tenancy.... The holder of land should
      either cultivate it with his own hands, or, as would be most frequently
      the case, by the hands of others; but in the latter case, the landed
      proprietor is bound to allow the agricultural laborer to live by his
      labor. By living I mean that the laborer should have healthy food,
      shelter, and clothing, and sufficient leisure in which to educate himself
      and his family, besides the necessary leisure for rest from his labors. At
      present agricultural laborers do not live; they only drag wearily through
      a career but little higher in any respect than&mdash;and often not half so
      comfortable as&mdash;that of many of the other animals on the estate....
    </p>
    <p>
      Little boys and girls, in the Midland, Eastern, Southern, and Southwestern
      counties of England, go into the fields to work, in some instances, soon
      after six years of age; in very many cases before they are seven years
      old, and in nearly all cases before they have attained eight. It is true,
      that the work at first may be the comparatively idle work of scaring birds
      or tending sheep, but it involves exposure of the child's yet delicate
      frame in the cold and damp of spring, and then to the heat of the summer
      sun, from day-dawn to evening. This too often results in the stunted
      growth and diseased frame found so frequently among the English poor. I
      say nothing of the demoralization of children consequent on their
      employment, without regard to sex, in the field gangs. I pass by the fact
      that work at this early age utterly incapacitates them, as a body, for
      mental effort. It is enough to declare that no child ought to have to work
      on the land until he is ten years of age, and if I am told that the
      fathers&mdash;only earning, in the majority of instances, from nine to
      thirteen shillings per week&mdash;need the additional petty wage these
      wretched babes may bring home, then again I answer, that it is to the
      landholder's enormous income that the State ought to look for the means of
      educating the too often worse than savages who are reared on his estate,
      and who by their labors swell his rent-roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      That a few landed proprietors should have gigantic incomes, while the mass
      of the people are so poor&mdash;that in Gloucester, the Rev. Mr. Frazer
      describes "type after type of social life almost degraded to the level of
      barbarism"&mdash;that near Lavenham, "the cottages are unfit for human
      habitation"&mdash;that in Norfolk the Parliamentary returns speak of their
      dwellings in one as "miserable," in a second as "deplorable," in a third
      as "detestable," in a fourth as "a disgrace to a Christian community;"
      while near Docking, we are told, in consequence of the overcrowding of the
      wretched poor, "the whole atmosphere is sensual, and human nature is
      degraded into something below the level of the swine." This is a state of
      things that if the landholders will not redress willingly they must be
      made to remedy before it is too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few men have vast estates and excessive incomes; the millions have
      seldom an inch of land until they inherit the grave, and have a starvation
      wage out of which a proportion is taken back for rent. Take the vast
      property of the Marquis of Westminster, whose income is credibly stated at
      something near a million a year; or that of the Duke of Devonshire,
      amounting to 96,000 acres in the county of Derby alone, without regarding
      his Irish or other estates; or that of the Duke of Norfolk, whose Sussex
      estate is fifteen miles in circuit; or that of the Duke of Sutherland,
      which stretches across and contains the whole of Sutherlandshire from sea
      to sea; or that of the Marquis of Bute, on which £2,000,-000 sterling were
      spent by his trustees during his minority; or that of the Marquis of
      Breadalbane, who is said to be able to ride from his own door one hundred
      miles straight to the sea on his own freehold land; or those of the Duke
      of Richmond and Lord Leconfield, who between them own nearly the whole of
      the eastern portion of the county of Sussex, containing nearly 800 square
      miles. And such estates have a tendency to increase rather than to
      diminish. In Northumberland, the Ducal proprietor, whose titular rank is
      derived from the county, is a constant purchaser of any lands put up for
      sale. Mr. Bright, in 1864, spoke of one nobleman who devoted £80,000 a
      year of his income to the purchase of additional land.
    </p>
    <p>
      These large properties must all be broken up; they paralyze the people,
      and they corrupt their possessors. We prefer that the breaking up shall be
      voluntary and gradual, but it must begin at once, for hungry bellies are
      multiplying daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The State ought to put the peasantry in possession of the land, and this
      might be done in several ways at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. There is the Prussian Land System, a modification of which might be
      made to work well here, and which since 1850 has enabled the smallest
      occupiers of peasants' land to acquire the proprietorship at twenty years'
      purchase; the amount of which is paid to the landlord, not in money, but
      in rent debentures issued by authority of the State, and bearing four per
      cent, interest, and gradually redeemable by means of the one per cent,
      difference, which at compound interest extinguishes the principal in a
      little over forty-one years. The Prussian peasant has, however, two other
      options: he may pay less by one-tenth to the State bank than the rent he
      formerly paid to his landlord, in which case the purchase debentures take
      fifty-six years to redeem; or he may, if he can raise the cash, compel his
      landlord to accept eighteen years' purchase money of the annual rent. By
      this means nearly 100,000 peasant proprietors have been created in
      Prussia. Kent debentures to the extent of many millions have been issued
      to the landholders, and in less than nineteen years more than one-eighth
      of the debentures issued have been entirely redeemed and extinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The Legislature should declare that leaving cultivable land
      uncultivated gave the Government the right to take possession of such
      land, assessing it by its actual return for the last live years, and not
      by its real value, and handing to the proprietor the amount of, say,
      twenty years' purchase in Consolidated Stock, redeemable in a limited term
      of years. The land so taken should not be sold at all, but should be let
      out to persons willing to become cultivators, on sufficiently long terms
      of tenancy to fairly recoup his labor and capital to the cultivator, who
      should yearly pay into the National Treasury, in lieu of all other
      imperial taxes, a certain proportion of the value of the annual produce.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. The game laws should be abolished. Game preserving in England is not
      only injurious, in that it diverts land capable of corn-bearing from the
      purpose it should fulfill, of growing corn to feed the starving, but it is
      injurious in that it prevents proper cultivation of surrounding farms, and
      demoralizes and makes criminals of the neighboring agriculturial laborers,
      creating for them a kind and degree of crime which would be otherwise
      unknown. Poaching, which is so severely punished, is actually fostered and
      encouraged by the very landholders who punish it. Pheasants and
      partridges' eggs are bought to stock preserves; the gamekeepers who buy
      these eggs shut their eyes to the mode in which they have been procured.
      The lad who was encouraged to procure the eggs finds himself in jail when
      he learns that shooting or trapping pheasants gains a higher pecuniary
      reward than leading the plow horse, or trimming the hedge, or grubbing the
      plantation. Poaching is the natural consequence of rearing a large number
      of rabbits, hares, partridges, and pheasants, in the midst of an
      underpaid, underfed, badly-housed, and deplorably ignorant body of people.
      The brutal outrages of gamekeepers of which we read so much are the
      regretable but easily-traceable measure of retaliation for a system which
      takes a baby child to work in the fields soon after six years of age,
      which trains all his worst propensities and deadens and degrades his
      better faculties, which keeps him in constant wretchedness, and tantalizes
      him with the sight of hundreds of acres on which game runs and flies
      well-fed, under his very nose, while he limps ill-fed along the muddy lane
      which skirts the preserve&mdash;game, which is at liberty to come out of
      its covert and eat and destroy the farmer's crop, but which is even then
      made sacred by the law, and fenced round by covenants, as in a Leitrim
      lease. The game laws must go; they starve our population by using land
      which might be golden to the autumn sun with the waving crop of wheat,
      barley, and rye; they feed our prisons, and rear a criminal class in our
      midst, who have to be prosecuted and guarded at great cost, and all
      because hares and pheasants are higher in the landowners' eyes than human
      beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Any person holding more than, say, 5,000 acres of land, should be taxed
      at a far heavier rate than those having smaller holdings. That is,
      presuming, in order to take a figure as basis, the land-tax on 5,000 acres
      to be at the rate of 1s. per acre, then on every acre above that quantity
      it should be 2s. per acre up to 10,000 acres, and from thence 5s. per acre
      up to 15,000 acres, and from thence 10s. per acre up to 20,000 acres, so
      as to discourage all extravagantly large holdings.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. The law of primogeniture should be repealed; the settlement of
      property, except for a widow and her children, be entirely prohibited and
      some limitation should be put on the power of devise, so as to prevent,
      say, the Marquis of Westminster from leaving the bulk of his property to
      his eldest son, while the younger ones are left as noble paupers, to be
      provided with places and pensions by the nation. Land should be made as
      easily and as cheaply transferable as any personal chattel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present land monopoly must be broken by legislation, or it will be
      destroyed by revolution.

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
