<h2>NOTE.</h2>
<p>The writer of the following little history
has presumed to borrow the peculiar style
of versification from Longfellow&rsquo;s celebrated
Song of Hiawatha.</p>
<p>She has carefully examined the records within
reach for the facts of her story. Should important
omissions occur, it will be due to the
meagerness of existing evidence.</p>
<p>May events so dear to hearts now at rest forever,
be perpetuated in the memory of the present
generation.</p>

<h2>THE SONG OF LANCASTER.</h2>
<h3>CANTO I.
<br /><span class="small">PRIMEVAL DAYS.</span></h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Hear a song of ancient story,</p>
<p class="t0">Of a city on a hillside,</p>
<p class="t0">Of the valleys all about it,</p>
<p class="t0">Of the forest and the wildwood,</p>
<p class="t0">Of the deer that stalked within it,</p>
<p class="t0">And the birds that flew above it,</p>
<p class="t0">And the wolves and bears around it,</p>
<p class="t0">Sole possessors and retainers</p>
<p class="t0">Of the silent territory.</p>
<p class="t0">Hear the song of its high mountains</p>
<p class="t0">Of its gushing rills and streamlets,</p>
<p class="t0">Of its leaping, rolling rivers,</p>
<p class="t0">Of the meadows still and lonely,</p>
<p class="t0">Of the groves all solitary,</p>
<p class="t0">Of the land of cunning fables.</p>
<p class="t0">Should you ask me of this city,</p>
<p class="t0">With its legends and its stories,</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_2">[2]</div>
<p class="t0">With its tales of peace and plenty,</p>
<p class="t0">With its tales of Indian warfare,</p>
<p class="t0">With its nights and days of watching,</p>
<p class="t0">With the camp-fires all a-gleaming,</p>
<p class="t0">And the white man&rsquo;s deadly peril,</p>
<p class="t0">I should answer, I should tell you,</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis the city of Lancaster,</p>
<p class="t0">In the county we call Garrard,</p>
<p class="t0">In the State of old Kentucky,</p>
<p class="t0">In America, the nation</p>
<p class="t0">On the continent Northwestern,</p>
<p class="t0">Found by Christopher Columbus.</p>
<p class="t0">Once a tangled, gloomy woodland,</p>
<p class="t0">With the music of its rivers,</p>
<p class="t0">As they wound along the grasses,</p>
<p class="t0">With the singing of its birdlings,</p>
<p class="t0">As they flew among the maples,</p>
<p class="t0">With the hissing of its reptiles,</p>
<p class="t0">Crawling o&rsquo;er the sylvan meadows,</p>
<p class="t0">With the growling of its wild beasts,</p>
<p class="t0">Lurking in the dells and caverns.</p>
<p class="t0">Angels gazed with pleasure on it,</p>
<p class="t0">On this Eden habitation,</p>
<p class="t0">On this work so calm and lovely;</p>
<p class="t0">On the moonlit, velvet carpet,</p>
<p class="t0">Where the fairies held their revels,</p>
<p class="t0">On the broad expanse of verdure,</p>
<p class="t0">With the sunbeams slanting o&rsquo;er it,</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_3">[3]</div>
<p class="t0">On the rugged mountain eyrie,</p>
<p class="t0">Where the eagle reared her nestlings,</p>
<p class="t0">On the tiny brooks that trickled</p>
<p class="t0">Down the glens so cool and shaded.</p>
<p class="t0">Green and fresh the ferns and mosses,</p>
<p class="t0">Clinging close to rock and crevice,</p>
<p class="t0">Pure and bright the silver waters,</p>
<p class="t0">Dancing o&rsquo;er the shelving limestone.</p>
<p class="t0">Angels saw and angels praised it,</p>
<p class="t0">For the gracious Spirit made it,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Very good&rdquo; the Spirit called it.</p>
<p class="t0">Happy valley! Peaceful shadows!</p>
<p class="t0">Glorious sunlight of an epoch,</p>
<p class="t0">Which the latter days can know not!</p>
<p class="t0">For the stride of man&rsquo;s progression</p>
<p class="t0">Desecrates these pristine beauties,</p>
<p class="t0">Bends these gorgeous land-scape beauties,</p>
<p class="t0">To his purposes of profit.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And the cycle brought its changes,</p>
<p class="t0">As the moons were waxing, waning.</p>
<p class="t0">The still tract of virgin woodland,</p>
<p class="t0">Was invaded by the demon</p>
<p class="t0">That the sweet primeval ages</p>
<p class="t0">Soon were destined to encounter,</p>
<p class="t0">The remorseless Indian demon,</p>
<p class="t0">The bold red man of the forest.</p>
<p class="t0">Then the wigwam and the peace-pipe</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_4">[4]</div>
<p class="t0">Sent aloft the smoke of welcome,</p>
<p class="t0">Welcome to the roving brothers,</p>
<p class="t0">To the tribes that wandered restless,</p>
<p class="t0">To the sachem and the chieftain,</p>
<p class="t0">To the warrior and the maiden.</p>
<p class="t0">I have said the tribes invaded</p>
<p class="t0">The sweet haunts of Nature&rsquo;s children,</p>
<p class="t0">Of her birds and beasts and reptiles,</p>
<p class="t0">Of her rivers, rills, and streamlets;</p>
<p class="t0">Of her trees and flowers and grasses,</p>
<p class="t0">Yet the song of peace continued.</p>
<p class="t0">Peaceful still, yet no more silent;</p>
<p class="t0">For where man, with human passion,</p>
<p class="t0">Dwells in all this wide creation,</p>
<p class="t0">Strife is ever slumb&rsquo;ring, waiting,</p>
<p class="t0">Waiting for the magic touchstone,</p>
<p class="t0">For the trouble he is born to,</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Trouble, as the sparks fly upward.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">So there rose a reign of terror,</p>
<p class="t0">Of dismay and cruel bloodshed,</p>
<p class="t0">When the white man came among them,</p>
<p class="t0">The all-potent, dreaded pale-face,</p>
<p class="t0">He, another bold invader,</p>
<p class="t0">An usurper of the woodland.</p>
<p class="t0">When he came with might and fury,</p>
<p class="t0">And the hatchet was uplifted,</p>
<p class="t0">When the war-cry sounded louder,</p>
<p class="t0">And the wigwam smoked in ashes,</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_5">[5]</div>
<p class="t0">And the peace-pipe fell forever,</p>
<p class="t0">From the lips all stiff and gory;</p>
<p class="t0">And the sachem and the chieftain,</p>
<p class="t0">And the warrior and the maiden,</p>
<p class="t0">Fled for safety from the woodland,</p>
<p class="t0">Roaming restless, ever moving,</p>
<p class="t0">To the land of deer and bison,</p>
<p class="t0">To the rolling, grassy prairies,</p>
<p class="t0">To the distant unknown regions,</p>
<p class="t0">To the placid, broad Pacific,</p>
<p class="t0">To the setting of the sunlight.</p>

<h3>CANTO II.
<br /><span class="small">1769-1796.
<br />PIONEERS.</span></h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In the days my Muse is singing,</p>
<p class="t0">In the days of early settlers</p>
<p class="t0">On the &ldquo;dark and bloody ground,&rdquo; there</p>
<p class="t0">Came a pioneer so famous</p>
<p class="t0">For his greatness and his goodness,</p>
<p class="t0">For his sterling sense of honor,</p>
<p class="t0">For his frame of strength and vigor,</p>
<p class="t0">For his nature, bold and hardy,</p>
<p class="t0">And his spirit, firm and steady,</p>
<p class="t0">That the annals of the nation,</p>
<p class="t0">The proud archives of the country,</p>
<p class="t0">Shout his name in stirring p&aelig;ans,</p>
<p class="t0">Blazon forth his fame and glory,</p>
<p class="t0">From the rising to the setting</p>
<p class="t0">Of the sun he loved to follow.</p>
<p class="t0">Many days and nights he wandered</p>
<p class="t0">O&rsquo;er the turf of good old Garrard,</p>
<p class="t0">Now in sight, perchance in hearing,</p>
<p class="t0">Of the birds and beasts and reptiles,</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_7">[7]</div>
<p class="t0">Roaming wild and roaming lonely,</p>
<p class="t0">In the groves of fair Lancaster.</p>
<p class="t0">Now in sight, perchance in hearing</p>
<p class="t0">Of the melancholy plover,</p>
<p class="t0">Of the bluebird&rsquo;s thrilling whistle,</p>
<p class="t0">Of the redbird&rsquo;s gentle chirping,</p>
<p class="t0">Of the blackbird&rsquo;s noisy chatter,</p>
<p class="t0">Of the whippoorwill&rsquo;s soft pleading,</p>
<p class="t0">And the ringdove&rsquo;s tender cooing.</p>
<p class="t0">All these sounds, I trow, were welcome,</p>
<p class="t0">To the pioneer hunter,</p>
<p class="t0">Daniel Boone, the practiced hunter.</p>
<p class="t0">On the plains and hills I&rsquo;m singing,</p>
<p class="t0">He has pitched his tent at nightfall,</p>
<p class="t0">And has laid him down to slumber,</p>
<p class="t0">With his deerskin wrapped about him,</p>
<p class="t0">With his household gathered &rsquo;round him.</p>
<p class="t0">And the creatures of the woodland,</p>
<p class="t0">The dumb creatures of the forest,</p>
<p class="t0">At the noisy crack and flashing</p>
<p class="t0">Of his trusty, timeworn rifle,</p>
<p class="t0">Fell, the prey of man&rsquo;s dominion,</p>
<p class="t0">Formed his frugal fare and feasting.</p>
<p class="t0">All about the plains and hilltops,</p>
<p class="t0">Are his faded, sacred landmarks.</p>
<p class="t0">Let them linger, ever linger,</p>
<p class="t0">Faithful witnesses of honor;</p>
<p class="t0">For the hunter sleeps forever,</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_8">[8]</div>
<p class="t0">Daniel Boone, the sturdy hunter,</p>
<p class="t0">Daniel Boone, the early settler,</p>
<p class="t0">Sleeps beneath the waving bluegrass,</p>
<p class="t0">Sleeps among the hills of Benson,</p>
<p class="t0">On the river side at Frankfort.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Other pioneers came hither,</p>
<p class="t0">Other white men sought the woodland,</p>
<p class="t0">When the red man fled to westward,</p>
<p class="t0">From the scenes so fierce and gory,</p>
<p class="t0">Where the tomahawk uplifted</p>
<p class="t0">Wrought such strife and havoc deadly.</p>
<p class="t0">And once more the axe is lifted,</p>
<p class="t0">And the monarchs of the forest,</p>
<p class="t0">Of the forest bought with bloodshed,</p>
<p class="t0">Fell with echoes loud and startling,</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Mid the lonely hills and valleys.</p>
<p class="t0">And the white man built a city,</p>
<p class="t0">In the woodland once so peaceful,</p>
<p class="t0">In the woodland once so warlike,</p>
<p class="t0">Built a fair and goodly city,</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Twas the city of Lancaster,</p>
<p class="t0">Yes, a stranger travelled westward,</p>
<p class="t0">From the land of trade and commerce,</p>
<p class="t0">Of William Penn and &ldquo;loving brothers,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">And the stranger&rsquo;s name was Paulding.</p>
<p class="t0">With his compass, chain, and log-book,</p>
<p class="t0">He marked out this modest city,</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_9">[9]</div>
<p class="t0">On the pattern of his birthplace,</p>
<p class="t0">And they christened it Lancaster.</p>
<p class="t0">And the county was called Garrard,</p>
<p class="t0">For the governor and statesman,</p>
<p class="t0">For James Garrard of Kentucky.</p>
<p class="t0">Seventeen hundred six and ninety</p>
<p class="t0">Saw the corner-stone implanted.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And the cycle brought its changes,</p>
<p class="t0">As the moons were waxing, waning.</p>
<p class="t0">Pav&eacute;d streets and handsome houses,</p>
<p class="t0">Busy shops and tradesmen&rsquo;s houses,</p>
<p class="t0">Office, inn, and people&rsquo;s houses,</p>
<p class="t0">Cottage white and mansion costly,</p>
<p class="t0">Structures high and structures lowly,</p>
<p class="t0">Marked the once secluded valley,</p>
<p class="t0">Graced the once sequestered hillside.</p>
<p class="t0">By and by the streets were fashioned</p>
<p class="t0">From the model of McAdam,</p>
<p class="t0">And adorned the youthful city.</p>
<p class="t0">Richmond, Mulberry, and Paulding,</p>
<p class="t0">Danville, Lexington, and Water,</p>
<p class="t0">Stanford, Campbell, and Crab Orchard,</p>
<p class="t0">Were the windings of the city.</p>
<p class="t0">And the noisy hum of traffic,</p>
<p class="t0">And the roll of cart and carriage,</p>
<p class="t0">Told of barter and of bargain,</p>
<p class="t0">Told of human gains and losses,</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_10">[10]</div>
<p class="t0">Scared away the beasts and birdlings,</p>
<p class="t0">Locked and dammed and bridged the rivers,</p>
<p class="t0">Chained the rolling streams and rivers.</p>
<p class="t0">Schools were opened, where the people</p>
<p class="t0">Learned to read and write and cipher.</p>
<p class="t0">Coaches linked the growing city</p>
<p class="t0">With the busy world around it.</p>
<p class="t0">Youths and maidens joined in wedlock,</p>
<p class="t0">Parents knelt at family altars,</p>
<p class="t0">Children gamboled in the playgrounds,</p>
<p class="t0">Cats and dogs and cows and horses,</p>
<p class="t0">Swine and animals of burden,</p>
<p class="t0">Followed man, the master spirit,</p>
<p class="t0">And supplied domestic comfort.</p>
<p class="t0">Lawyers, doctors, merchants, traders,</p>
<p class="t0">Preachers, artisans, and idlers,</p>
<p class="t0">From afar and near flocked hither;</p>
<p class="t0">And the &ldquo;continental coppers&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Were in speedy circulation.</p>
<p class="t0">Spinning, weaving, sewing, knitting,</p>
<p class="t0">Filled the women&rsquo;s dextrous fingers,</p>
<p class="t0">And the homespun and the linsey</p>
<p class="t0">Were the choice and boasted fabrics,</p>

<p class="t0">In the middle of the township.</p>
<p class="t0">Fence of stone with iron railing,</p>
<p class="t0">By and by extended round it,</p>
<p class="t0">Blooming locusts brown and lofty</p>
<p class="t0">Cast their cooling shadows o&rsquo;er it.</p>
<p class="t0">On its rostrum men of power</p>
<p class="t0">Oft declaimed to judge and jury;</p>
<p class="t0">At its bar were earnest pleadings</p>
<p class="t0">For the erring and the guilty.</p>

<p class="t0">Still advancing, ever onward.</p>
<p class="t0">In the suburbs of the city,</p>
<p class="t0">Rose a noted house of worship,</p>
<p class="t0">Large and generous in model,</p>

<p class="t0">And the curious Shaking Quakers.</p>
<p class="t0">These might not be met as fellows,</p>
<p class="t0">By the followers of Jesus;</p>
<p class="t0">These were aliens from the sheepfold.</p>
<p class="t0">All around the sacred building,</p>
<p class="t0">Slept the dead, both high and lowly,</p>
<p class="t0">(For death came into the city,)</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_15">[15]</div>

<p class="t0">Marked the resting of the wicked,</p>
<p class="t0">Of the infant and the aged,</p>
<p class="t0">Of the slave and of the master,</p>
<p class="t0">Of the mourned, the loved departed.</p>

<p class="t0">Names renowned on fields of battle,</p>

<p class="t0">By each absent son and daughter.</p>
<p class="t0">Many years beyond this period,</p>
<p class="t0">(Well I ken the oft told story,)</p>
<p class="t0">On a sunny day in autumn,</p>
<p class="t0">When the leaves were &ldquo;sere and yellow,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">When the woods were melancholy,</p>
<p class="t0">There were little children clustered</p>
<p class="t0">In this notable old school-room;</p>
<p class="t0">There were little children striving,</p>
<p class="t0">For the prize-book and the medal,</p>
<p class="t0">Children conning words in triumph,</p>
<p class="t0">Down the line of b-a-baker,</p>
<p class="t0">Children frowning o&rsquo;er the problems</p>
<p class="t0">Of the higher rules and text-books,</p>
<p class="t0">When a shadow crossed the doorway,</p>
<p class="t0">And there followed it, a stranger.</p>
<p class="t0">Then the children quickly started,</p>
<p class="t0">At the bidding of the teacher,</p>
<p class="t0">And in attitude of homage,</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_17">[17]</div>
<p class="t0">Gravely gazed upon the stranger.</p>
<p class="t0">On his venerable person,</p>
<p class="t0">On his hair all white and silvered,</p>
<p class="t0">On his brow all seamed and furrowed,</p>
<p class="t0">On his countenance so noble,</p>
<p class="t0">Gazed with looks of silent wonder.</p>
<p class="t0">He surveyed the group with pleasure,</p>
<p class="t0">He beheld them with emotion;</p>
<p class="t0">And his heart was touched within him,</p>
<p class="t0">All his spirit stirred within him,</p>
<p class="t0">At their prompt, respectful greeting,</p>
<p class="t0">At their attitude of welcome.</p>
<p class="t0">Turning then to front the teacher,</p>
<p class="t0">He said, &ldquo;Madam, I am weary,</p>
<p class="t0">I am travel-worn and dusty,</p>
<p class="t0">I have wandered long and restless,</p>
<p class="t0">I have come from distant regions,</p>
<p class="t0">To behold this treasured school-house,</p>
<p class="t0">See again its wall all penciled,</p>
<p class="t0">With the names I well remember,</p>
<p class="t0">With the deeds of my school-fellows;</p>
<p class="t0">To review once more the playground,</p>
<p class="t0">Where my boyhood&rsquo;s days were merry;</p>
<p class="t0">Jackman&rsquo;s Cave, the pond, the meadow,</p>
<p class="t0">And the spring at Captain Baker&rsquo;s;</p>
<p class="t0">All these places I have trodden,</p>

<p class="t0">Then he paused and looked about him,</p>
<p class="t0">But alas! the walls were covered,</p>
<p class="t0">Covered o&rsquo;er with paper hangings,</p>
<p class="t0">Of the style so new and modern,</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We have sung the hillside city</p>
<p class="t0">In the wilds of old Kentucky,</p>
<p class="t0">In the fruitful, blue-grass region,</p>
<p class="t0">In its central rich location.</p>
<p class="t0">We have sung its days of beauty,</p>
<p class="t0">From the hands of the Creator;</p>
<p class="t0">Of its innocence and quiet,</p>
<p class="t0">Ere the foot of man had pressed it;</p>
<p class="t0">We have sung its days of progress</p>
<p class="t0">Since the first rude cot was fashioned;</p>
<p class="t0">We have sung its days of pleasure</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Mid its households and its people;</p>
<p class="t0">We have sung its days of profit</p>
<p class="t0">In the gain of cents and dollars;</p>
<p class="t0">Days of rustic simple manners,</p>
<p class="t0">Days of industry and labor,</p>
<p class="t0">Days of glory and of triumph,</p>
<p class="t0">Days of pride and exultation.</p>
<p class="t0">Now, there came a fatal era,</p>
<p class="t0">When the busy hum of traffic</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_53">[53]</div>
<p class="t0">Filled no more the stirring places;</p>
<p class="t0">When the noisy roll of carriage</p>
<p class="t0">Ceased to sound along the pavements,</p>
<p class="t0">And the death cart&rsquo;s slow procession</p>
<p class="t0">Told of woe and desolation,</p>
<p class="t0">Told of pestilence and danger,</p>
<p class="t0">Told of cottages all empty,</p>
<p class="t0">And of mansions grim and silent,</p>
<p class="t0">Of the hearthstones all deserted,</p>
<p class="t0">All the happy, quiet hearthstones.</p>
<p class="t0">In this sad and fearful era,</p>
<p class="t0">In the year of eighteen hundred</p>
<p class="t0">Three and thirty, came a despot,</p>
<p class="t0">More oppressive in his power</p>
<p class="t0">Than the hosts of foreign armies,</p>
<p class="t0">More insatiate in his passion</p>
<p class="t0">Than the simoon of the desert.</p>
<p class="t0">Came a despot whose invasion</p>
<p class="t0">Struck the heart all dumb with terror,</p>
<p class="t0">Drove the people, panic-stricken,</p>
<p class="t0">From the homes so neat and tasteful,</p>
<p class="t0">From the places dear and sacred,</p>
<p class="t0">To the refuge of the country,</p>

<p class="t0">With its desolating vengeance,</p>
<p class="t0">With its greedy, fatal cravings,</p>
<p class="t0">Laying hands upon the city.</p>
<p class="t0">And the doom&eacute;d victims yielded</p>
<p class="t0">To the swift-distilling poison;</p>
<p class="t0">White and black and high and lowly,</p>
<p class="t0">Fell beneath the sweeping scythe-blade.</p>
<p class="t0">On the air was borne the crying</p>
<p class="t0">Of the hurrying, the fleeing,</p>
<p class="t0">Through the air the sad lamenting</p>
<p class="t0">Of the helpless and deserted,</p>
<p class="t0">Cries of anguish and of terror,</p>
<p class="t0">Wails of suff&rsquo;ring and despairing.</p>
<p class="t0">Some brave souls remained in peril,</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Mid this notable hegira;</p>
<p class="t0">Some remained with Spartan courage,</p>
<p class="t0">And the enemy confronted;</p>

<p class="t0">Had its birth one fair October,</p>
<p class="t0">Eighteen hundred eight and thirty.</p>
<p class="t0">Colonel William Stein commanded</p>
<p class="t0">The renowned Cornstalk Militia,</p>
<p class="t0">Of the county of old Garrard,</p>
<p class="t0">Near the city of Lancaster.</p>
<p class="t0">None but officers might join them,</p>
<p class="t0">Colonels, Majors, and Lieutenants,</p>
<p class="t0">Captains, Corporals, and Sergeants;</p>
<p class="t0">Only officers were mustered,</p>
<p class="t0">In the regimental phalanx.</p>
<p class="t0">Stein was large and he was burly,</p>
<p class="t0">Was among the &ldquo;sons of Anak,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Made a Captain by Dame Nature,</p>
<p class="t0">In his giant-sized proportions,</p>
<p class="t0">Made a Colonel by his merits,</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_61">[61]</div>
<p class="t0">By his lofty aspirations.</p>
<p class="t0">But the county-seat of Garrard,</p>
<p class="t0">The ambitious, inland city,</p>
<p class="t0">Sent a popular petition,</p>
<p class="t0">To the capital at Frankfort,</p>
<p class="t0">To the legislative rulers,</p>
<p class="t0">For an Act incorporating</p>
<p class="t0">Their militia into Guardsmen.</p>
<p class="t0">And forthwith their prayer was granted,</p>
<p class="t0">Quickly granted by the rulers.</p>
<p class="t0">See them now, the dashing Guardsmen,</p>
<p class="t0">With their youthful men all mustered,</p>
<p class="t0">With their uniform so dainty,</p>
<p class="t0">With white pants and true-blue jackets,</p>
<p class="t0">With their bayonets and muskets,</p>
<p class="t0">All their jaunty sails and rigging!</p>
<p class="t0">By and by their martial exploits,</p>
<p class="t0">By and by their bold pretensions,</p>
<p class="t0">Won a challenge from the Cornstalks,</p>
<p class="t0">The redoubtable militia,</p>
<p class="t0">From the band of Regimentals,</p>
<p class="t0">Now encamped upon the river,</p>
<p class="t0">From the fearless giant Colonel,</p>
<p class="t0">To appear in his dominions.</p>
<p class="t0">John A. Flack, the warlike Captain</p>
<p class="t0">Of the brave and youthful Guardsmen,</p>
<p class="t0">Was not then within the city,</p>
<p class="t0">Was not then at post of duty;</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_62">[62]</div>
<p class="t0">And his men were in disorder,</p>
<p class="t0">Were all scattered in confusion.</p>
<p class="t0">But they soon began to rally,</p>
<p class="t0">On one fair October evening,</p>
<p class="t0">Rally &rsquo;round their platoon leaders,</p>
<p class="t0">Ready to accept the challenge.</p>
<p class="t0">Of their number was a stranger,</p>
<p class="t0">An adopted son of Garrard,</p>
<p class="t0">Who was light and lithe of person,</p>
<p class="t0">Who was full of life and vigor,</p>
<p class="t0">Who had visited the city,</p>
<p class="t0">The good city of Lancaster;</p>
<p class="t0">Who had joined her sports and pastimes,</p>
<p class="t0">Eager for the hour&rsquo;s amusement,</p>
<p class="t0">Ever foremost in adventure;</p>
<p class="t0">And the stranger&rsquo;s name was Dunlap,</p>
<p class="t0">And his home was in Lafayette.</p>
<p class="t0">He was one of twenty-seven,</p>
<p class="t0">Who advanced on the Militia,</p>
<p class="t0">At the silent hour of midnight;</p>
<p class="t0">Who attacked the Regimentals,</p>
<p class="t0">Near the bridge across Dix River,</p>
<p class="t0">In the county we call Lincoln;</p>
<p class="t0">Who invaded the dominions</p>
<p class="t0">Of the annual encampment,</p>
<p class="t0">On the fair October evening,</p>
<p class="t0">Eighteen hundred eight and thirty.</p>
<p class="t0">Sweetly rest the noble Cornstalks,</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_63">[63]</div>
<p class="t0">On their arms are calmly sleeping,</p>
<p class="t0">Resting on their arms by moonlight,</p>
<p class="t0">Resting, ignorant of danger.</p>
<p class="t0">Bright the ever-shifting heavens,</p>
<p class="t0">Dark the trees and woodland shadows,</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Round the band of Regimentals,</p>
<p class="t0">Near the river-bridge of Lincoln.</p>
<p class="t0">Gently came the night besiegers,</p>
<p class="t0">Softly marched the twenty-seven,</p>
<p class="t0">When a sharp, out-standing picket</p>
<p class="t0">Sounded forth the note of warning,</p>
<p class="t0">With his damp and rusty weapon,</p>
<p class="t0">Blazoned forth the call of danger,</p>
<p class="t0">With the snapping of his musket.</p>
<p class="t0">Quick the camp is in commotion.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;To arms!&rdquo; &ldquo;To arms!&rdquo; shout the Militia,</p>
<p class="t0">The surprised and sleepy Cornstalks.</p>
<p class="t0">And the men run hither, thither</p>
<p class="t0">In a search for the assailants,</p>
<p class="t0">When a noise of tramping horses,</p>
<p class="t0">Through the river-bridge, attracts them.</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Twas a feint arranged beforehand,</p>
<p class="t0">To delude the Regimentals,</p>
<p class="t0">And they dashed on to the outskirts,</p>
<p class="t0">Dashed the wild, bewildered Cornstalks,</p>
<p class="t0">In a wayward false direction.</p>
<p class="t0">The young Guards meanwhile crept onward,</p>
<p class="t0">Softly crept to camp behind them:</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_64">[64]</div>
<p class="t0">Four platoons of jolly Guardsmen,</p>
<p class="t0">March and counter-march upon them,</p>
<p class="t0">Fire blank cartridges among them,</p>
<p class="t0">Lighting up the woods around them;</p>
<p class="t0">Thrust the bayonets dull before them,</p>
<p class="t0">March and counter-march in order,</p>
<p class="t0">Fire and load again the flintlocks,</p>
<p class="t0">Till the woodland fairly blazes.</p>
<p class="t0">In one of these illuminations,</p>
<p class="t0">Dunlap saw the foe approaching,</p>
<p class="t0">Coming &rsquo;round to flank the columns</p>
<p class="t0">Of the bold midnight invaders.</p>
<p class="t0">Then he ordered forth his platoon,</p>
<p class="t0">To cut off the brave Militia,</p>
<p class="t0">To arrest the flanking Cornstalks,</p>
<p class="t0">When pell-mell fell all together,</p>
<p class="t0">In the hard-contested battle.</p>
<p class="t0">But the weak, outnumbered Guardsmen,</p>
<p class="t0">&mdash;Some among the twenty-seven&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Soon were caught and held in capture,</p>
<p class="t0">Soon were dragged within the circle</p>
<p class="t0">Of the annual encampment.</p>
<p class="t0">All the others scampered swiftly,</p>
<p class="t0">Scampered off in each direction,</p>
<p class="t0">Struggling, seeking to escape them,</p>
<p class="t0">Fleeing from the Regimentals.</p>
<p class="t0">Dunlap found himself confronted</p>
<p class="t0">By a single Lincoln Cornstalk,</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_65">[65]</div>
<p class="t0">(Dr. Huffman, a &ldquo;Militia,&rdquo;)</p>
<p class="t0">Who essayed at once to take him.</p>
<p class="t0">Hand-to-hand in duel comic,</p>
<p class="t0">They careered with flintlocks rusty,</p>
<p class="t0">They embraced with bayonets blunted,</p>
<p class="t0">Dunlap all the while retreating,</p>
<p class="t0">Huffman all the while pursuing,</p>
<p class="t0">Till a wide ravine arrested,</p>
<p class="t0">Stopped their wild, ferocious progress.</p>
<p class="t0">Not for long the pause, however;</p>
<p class="t0">Dunlap, lithe of limb and active,</p>
<p class="t0">Sprang across the yawning chasm,</p>
<p class="t0">Huffman, chasing, fell within it,</p>
<p class="t0">Rolling down the steep embankment.</p>
<p class="t0">Then young Dunlap, still escaping,</p>
<p class="t0">Running from his checked pursuer,</p>
<p class="t0">Saw before him in the pathway</p>
<p class="t0">Another hand-to-hand encounter.</p>
<p class="t0">It was Stein, the burly Colonel</p>
<p class="t0">Of the conquering Militia;</p>
<p class="t0">It was Stein disarming Paddy,</p>
<p class="t0">Irish Paddy of the Guardsmen;</p>
<p class="t0">Stein disarming Surgeon Buford,</p>
<p class="t0">Of the Lancaster Battalion.</p>
<p class="t0">Lucky moment for the Guardsmen,</p>
<p class="t0">All their men were lost but fourteen,</p>
<p class="t0">Fourteen men of twenty-seven;</p>
<p class="t0">But the man that sent the challenge,</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_66">[66]</div>
<p class="t0">The bold Colonel of the Cornstalks,</p>
<p class="t0">Was divided from his soldiers,</p>
<p class="t0">Was a helpless prey before them.</p>
<p class="t0">Taking in the situation,</p>
<p class="t0">Gaming courage with good fortune,</p>
<p class="t0">Dunlap plunged at once to aid them,</p>
<p class="t0">Aid the surgeon and the private,</p>
<p class="t0">And when three to one in number,</p>
<p class="t0">To arrest the burly Colonel.</p>
<p class="t0">Then they clinched and fell and struggled,</p>
<p class="t0">Then they fought and rolled and rallied,</p>
<p class="t0">And arose but ne&rsquo;er released him,</p>
<p class="t0">Till the man that sent the challenge</p>
<p class="t0">Was compelled to cry surrender.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I surrender, <i>but don&rsquo;t duck me</i>,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Pleaded hard the gallant Colonel.</p>
<p class="t0">And the victors, showing mercy,</p>
<p class="t0">Gathered up the scattered Guardsmen,</p>
<p class="t0">Fourteen men of twenty-seven,</p>
<p class="t0">And proceeded home in triumph,</p>
<p class="t0">Took their captive to the city,</p>
<p class="t0">To the slumb&rsquo;ring, quiet city,</p>
<p class="t0">To Lancaster on the hillside.</p>
<p class="t0">But the scattered Guards, returning</p>
<p class="t0">Through the river-bridge at midnight,</p>
<p class="t0">Scared and startled Dunlap&rsquo;s posse,</p>
<p class="t0">At the moment of their vict&rsquo;ry,</p>
<p class="t0">Scared and startled Stein&rsquo;s besiegers,</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_67">[67]</div>
<p class="t0">Till they fled across the fences,</p>
<p class="t0">Till they dared not bear their captive</p>
<p class="t0">O&rsquo;er the dangerous moonlit highway.</p>
<p class="t0">On and on the captors wandered,</p>
<p class="t0">Wandered over brush and briers,</p>
<p class="t0">Stumbling on through creeks and by-ways,</p>
<p class="t0">Climbing hills and wading gullies,</p>
<p class="t0">Sometimes running, sometimes halting,</p>
<p class="t0">Till the men were all exhausted,</p>
<p class="t0">All but Dunlap and his captive.</p>
<p class="t0">Paddy fell out by the wayside,</p>
<p class="t0">Buford lagged behind to nurse him;</p>
<p class="t0">Some lay down beside their muskets,</p>
<p class="t0">Giving up the vain exertion;</p>
<p class="t0">Some were nerved to struggle onward,</p>
<p class="t0">Eager to proclaim the tidings;</p>
<p class="t0">But the pris&rsquo;ner tried to tire them,</p>
<p class="t0">In the deviating pathways,</p>
<p class="t0">In the windings of the by-ways,</p>
<p class="t0">He endeavored to elude them,</p>
<p class="t0">Till his giant-sized proportions</p>
<p class="t0">Yielded to the boyish runners,</p>
<p class="t0">Till his strategy and ruses</p>
<p class="t0">Were outwitted by the youngsters.</p>
<p class="t0">And the fair October morning</p>
<p class="t0">Was just peeping o&rsquo;er the hill-tops</p>
<p class="t0">Of victorious Lancaster,</p>
<p class="t0">When the tramp of full two hundred</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_68">[68]</div>
<p class="t0">Broke upon the early watches;</p>
<p class="t0">When two hundred men, exultant,</p>
<p class="t0">Started forth in marching columns,</p>
<p class="t0">With the drum and fife resounding,</p>
<p class="t0">Started forth to meet the victors.</p>

<p class="t0"><i>Eight</i> alone of twenty-seven.</p>
<p class="t0">And the doorways of the city,</p>
<p class="t0">All the windows of the city,</p>

<p class="t0">While the handkerchiefs were waving,</p>
<p class="t0">Flags-of-truce, their white unfurling.</p>
<p class="t0">Nearer came the weary Guardsmen,</p>

<p class="t0">With white pants, alas! all muddy;</p>
<p class="t0">Torn and soiled the true-blue jackets,</p>
<p class="t0">Scratched and worn the hands and faces.</p>
<p class="t0">But the great crest-fallen captive,</p>
<p class="t0">Was in plight both sad and comic!</p>

<p class="t0">With his red bandana nightcap</p>
<p class="t0">Wound about his head so lordly,</p>
<p class="t0">With his armless sleeping-jacket</p>
<p class="t0">Hanging on his martial figure,</p>
<p class="t0">He was borne aloft in triumph,</p>
<p class="t0">To the court-house of the city,</p>
<p class="t0">To the central public building,</p>
<p class="t0">In the middle of the city.</p>
<p class="t0">Then they honored him with feasting,</p>
<p class="t0">Served him well with cheering viands,</p>
<p class="t0">And they clad his martial figure</p>
<p class="t0">In a military outfit.</p>
<p class="t0">Golden crests upon the shoulders,</p>
<p class="t0">Gilded buttons down the vestings,</p>
<p class="t0">Brand-new hat and boots all shining,</p>
<p class="t0">Spotless coat and handsome trappings,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">These they gave the fallen hero,</p>
<p class="t0">Gave the helpless, conquered Colonel.</p>
<p class="t0">And upon a dashing charger,</p>
<p class="t0">On a fine dun horse of Proctor&rsquo;s,</p>
<p class="t0">He was given back his freedom,</p>
<p class="t0">He was sent to the encampment,</p>

<p class="t0">Nature views her splendid ruins,</p>
<p class="t0">In a garb of man&rsquo;s creation;</p>
<p class="t0">Smooths her rugged frowns and wrinkles,</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Neath the mask of modern pruning;</p>
<p class="t0">Draws her cloven foot in hiding,</p>
<p class="t0">Under skirts of art so simple;</p>
<p class="t0">Buries all her savage spirit,</p>
<p class="t0">In the graces of refinement;</p>
<p class="t0">Merges wilderness and mountain,</p>

<p class="t0">And her name, no longer rustic,</p>
<p class="t0">Bears the soubriquet, Lancaster.</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis our birthplace, dear and sacred,</p>

<p class="t0">May her blessings ever linger,</p>
<p class="t0">As the cycle brings its changes.</p>
<p class="t0">May the strife of human passions,</p>
<p class="t0">May all riots and dissensions,</p>
<p class="t0">May disease and flood and fire,</p>
<p class="t0">Lift their baleful shadows from her.</p>
<p class="t0">Let her children cling unto her,</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Mid the wreck of mind and matter:</p>

<p>The publication of the Song of Lancaster has been delayed
eighteen months in order to obtain the names of the Garrard
County Confederate soldiers. The author advertised extensively
with this view, and one hundred and twenty-seven names

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
