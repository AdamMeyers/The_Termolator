    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      In one sense this book stands by itself. It is like nothing else I have
      written, and if one should seek to give it the name of a class, it might
      be called an historical fantasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It followed The Trail of the Sword and preceded The Seats of the Mighty,
      and appeared in the summer of 1895. The critics gave it a reception which
      was extremely gratifying, because, as it seemed to me, they realised what
      I was trying to do; and that is a great deal. One great journal said it
      read as though it had been written at a sitting; another called it a tour
      de force, and the grave Athenaeum lauded it in a key which was likely to
      make me nervous, since it seemed to set a standard which I should find it
      hard to preserve in the future. But in truth the newspaper was right which
      said that the book read as though it was written at a sitting, and that it
      was a tour de force. The facts are that the book was written, printed,
      revised, and ready for press in five weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The manuscript of the book was complete within four weeks. It possessed
      me. I wrote night and day. There were times when I went to bed and, unable
      to sleep, I would get up at two o'clock or three o'clock in the morning
      and write till breakfast time. A couple of hours' walk after breakfast,
      and I would write again until nearly two o'clock. Then luncheon;
      afterwards a couple of hours in the open air, and I would again write till
      eight o'clock in the evening. The world was shut out. I moved in a dream.
      The book was begun at Hot Springs, in Virginia, in the annex to the old
      Hot Springs Hotel. I could not write in the hotel itself, so I went to the
      annex, and in the big building&mdash;in the early spring-time&mdash;I
      worked night and day. There was no one else in the place except the old
      negro caretaker and his wife. Four-fifths of the book was written in three
      weeks there. Then I went to New York, and at the Lotus Club, where I had a
      room, I finished it&mdash;but not quite. There were a few pages of the
      book to do when I went for my walk in Fifth Avenue one afternoon. I could
      not shake the thing off, the last pages demanded to be written. The sermon
      which the old Cure was preaching on Valmond's death was running in my
      head. I could not continue my walk. Then and there I stepped into the
      Windsor Hotel, which I was passing, and asked if there was a stenographer
      at liberty. There was. In the stenographer's office of the Windsor Hotel,
      with the life of a caravanserai buzzing around me, I dictated the last few
      pages of When Valmond Came to Pontiac. It was practically my only
      experience of dictation of fiction. I had never been able to do it, and
      have not been able to do it since, and I am glad that it is so, for I
      should have a fear of being led into mere rhetoric. It did not, however,
      seem to matter with this book. It wrote itself anywhere. The proofs of the
      first quarter of the book were in my hands before I had finished writing
      the last quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took me a long time to recover from the great effort of that five
      weeks, but I never regretted those consuming fires which burned up sleep
      and energy and ravaged the vitality of my imagination. The story was
      founded on the incident described in the first pages of the book, which
      was practically as I experienced it when I was a little child. The picture
      there drawn of Valmond was the memory of just such a man as stood at the
      four corners in front of the little hotel and scattered his hot pennies to
      the children of the village. Also, my father used to tell me as a child a
      story of Napoleon, whose history he knew as well as any man living, and
      something of that story may be found in the fifth chapter of the book
      where Valmond promotes Sergeant Lagroin from non-commissioned rank, first
      to be captain, then to be colonel, and then to be general, all in a
      moment, as it were.
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot tell the original story as my father told it to me here, but it
      was the tale of how a sergeant in the Old Guard, having shared his bivouac
      supper of roasted potatoes with the Emperor, was told by Napoleon that he
      should sup with his Emperor when they returned to Versailles. The old
      sergeant appeared at Versailles in course of time and demanded admittance
      to the Emperor, saying that he had been asked to supper. When Napoleon was
      informed, he had the veteran shown in and, recognising his comrade of the
      baked potatoes, said at once that the sergeant should sup with him. The
      sergeant's reply was: "Sire, how can a non-commissioned officer dine with
      a general?" It was then, Napoleon, delighted with the humour and the
      boldness of his grenadier, summoned the Old Guard, and had the sergeant
      promoted to the rank of captain on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was these apparently incongruous things, together with legends that I
      had heard and read of Napoleon, which gave me the idea of Valmond. First,
      a sketch of about five thousand words was written, and it looked as though
      I were going to publish it as a short story; but one day, sitting in a
      drawing-room in front of a grand piano, on the back of which were a series
      of miniatures of the noted women who had played their part in Napoleon's
      life, the incident of the Countess of Carnstadt (I do not use the real
      name) at St. Helena associated itself with the picture in my memory of the
      philanthropist of the street corner. Thereupon the whole story of a son of
      Napoleon, ignorant of his own birth, but knowing that a son had been born
      to Napoleon at St. Helena, flitted through my imagination; and the story
      spread out before me all in an hour, like an army with banners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next night&mdash;for this happened in New York&mdash;I went down to
      Hot Springs, Virginia, and began a piece of work which enthralled me as I
      had never before been enthralled, and as I have never been enthralled in
      the same way since; for it was perilous to health and mental peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fantasy as it is, the book has pictures of French-Canadian life which are
      as true as though the story itself was all true. Characters are in it like
      Medallion, the little chemist, the avocat, Lajeunesse the blacksmith, and
      Madeleinette, his daughter, which were in some of the first sketches I
      ever wrote of French Canada, and subsequently appearing in the novelette
      entitled The Lane That Had No Turning. Indeed, 'When Valmond Came to
      Pontiac', historical fantasy as it is, has elements both of romance and
      realism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the books which I have written, perhaps because it cost me so much,
      because it demanded so much of me at the time of its writing, I care for
      it the most. It was as good work as I could do. This much may at least be
      said: that no one has done anything quite in the same way or used the same
      subject, or given it the same treatment. Also it may be said, as the
      Saturday Review remarked, that it contained one whole, new idea, and that
      was the pathetic&mdash;unutterably pathetic&mdash;incident of a man driven
      by the truth in his blood to impersonate himself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      On one corner stood the house of Monsieur Garon the avocat; on another,
      the shop of the Little Chemist; on another, the office of Medallion the
      auctioneer; and on the last, the Hotel Louis Quinze. The chief
      characteristics of Monsieur Garon's house were its brass door-knobs, and
      the verdant vines that climbed its sides; of the Little Chemist's shop,
      the perfect whiteness of the building, the rolls of sober wall-paper, and
      the bottles of coloured water in the shop windows; of Medallion's, the
      stoop that surrounded three sides of the building, and the notices of
      sales tacked up, pasted up, on the front; of the Hotel Louis Quinze, the
      deep dormer windows, the solid timbers, and the veranda that gave its
      front distinction&mdash;for this veranda had been the pride of several
      generations of landlords, and its heavy carving and bulky grace were worth
      even more admiration than Pontiac gave to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The square which the two roads and the four corners made was, on
      week-days, the rendezvous of Pontiac, and the whole parish; on Sunday
      mornings the rendezvous was shifted to the large church on the hill,
      beside which was the house of the Cure, Monsieur Fabre. Travelling towards
      the south, out of the silken haze of a mid-summer day, you would come in
      time to the hills of Maine; north, to the city of Quebec and the river St.
      Lawrence; east, to the ocean; and west, to the Great Lakes and the land of
      the English. Over this bright province Britain raised her flag, but only
      Medallion and a few others loved it for its own sake, or saluted it in the
      English tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the drab velvety dust of these four corners, were gathered, one night
      of July a generation ago, the children of the village and many of their
      elders. All the events of that epoch were dated from the evening of this
      particular day. Another day of note the parish cherished, but it was
      merely a grave fulfilment of the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the veranda-stoop of the Louis Quinze stood a man of apparently about
      twenty-eight years of age. When you came to study him closely, some sense
      of time and experience in his look told you that he might be thirty-eight,
      though his few grey hairs seemed but to emphasise a certain youthfulness
      in him. His eye was full, singularly clear, almost benign, and yet at one
      moment it gave the impression of resolution, at another it suggested the
      wayward abstraction of the dreamer. He was well-figured, with a hand of
      peculiar whiteness, suggesting in its breadth more the man of action than
      of meditation. But it was a contradiction; for, as you saw it rise and
      fall, you were struck by its dramatic delicacy; as it rested on the
      railing of the veranda, by its latent power. You faced incongruity
      everywhere. His dress was bizarre, his face almost classical, the brow
      clear and strong, the profile good to the mouth, where there showed a
      combination of sensuousness and adventure. Yet in the face there was an
      illusive sadness, strangely out of keeping with the long linen coat,
      frilled shirt, flowered waistcoat, lavender trousers, boots of enamelled
      leather, and straw hat with white linen streamers. It was a whimsical
      picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment that the Cure and Medallion the auctioneer came down the
      street together towards the Louis Quinze, talking amiably, this singular
      gentleman was throwing out hot pennies, with a large spoon, from a tray in
      his hand, calling on the children to gather them, in French which was not
      the French of Pontiac&mdash;or Quebec; and this refined accent the Cure
      was quick to detect, as Monsieur Garon the avocat, standing on the
      outskirts of the crowd, had done, some moments before. The stranger seemed
      only conscious of his act of liberality and the children before him. There
      was a naturalness in his enjoyment which was almost boylike; a naive sort
      of exultation possessed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed softly to see the children toss the pennies from hand to hand,
      blowing to cool them; the riotous yet half-timorous scramble for them, and
      burnt fingers thrust into hot, blithe mouths. And when he saw a fat little
      lad of five crowded out of the way by his elders, he stepped down with a
      quick word of sympathy, put a half-dozen pennies in the child's pocket,
      snatched him up and kissed him, and then returned to the stoop, where were
      gathered the landlord, the miller, and Monsieur De la Riviere, the young
      Seigneur. But the most intent spectator of the scene was Parpon the dwarf,
      who was grotesquely crouched upon the wide ledge of a window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tray after tray of pennies was brought out and emptied, till at last the
      stranger paused, handed the spoon to the landlord, drew out a fine white
      handkerchief and dusted his fingers, standing silent for a moment and
      smiling upon the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this point that some young villager called, in profuse
      compliment: "Three cheers for the Prince!" The stranger threw an accent of
      pose into his manner, his eye lighted, his chin came up, he dropped one
      hand negligently on his hip, and waved the other in acknowledgment.
      Presently he beckoned, and from the hotel were brought out four great
      pitchers of wine and a dozen tin cups, and, sending the garcon around with
      one, the landlord with another, he motioned Parpon the dwarf to bear a
      hand. Parpon shot out a quick, half-resentful look at him, but meeting a
      warm, friendly eye, he took the pitcher and went round among the elders,
      while the stranger himself courteously drank with the young men of the
      village, who, like many wiser folk, thus yielded to the charm of mystery.
      To every one he said a hearty thing, and sometimes touched his greeting
      off with a bit of poetry or a rhetorical phrase. These dramatic
      extravagances served him well, for he was among a race of story-tellers
      and crude poets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parpon, uncouth and furtive, moved through the crowd, dispensing as much
      irony as wine:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       "Three bucks we come to a pretty inn,
        'Hostess,' say we, 'have you red wine?'
             Brave! Brave!
        'Hostess,' say we, 'have you red wine?'
             Bravement!
        Our feet are sore and our crops are dry,
             Bravement!"
</pre>
    <p>
      This he hummed to the avocat in a tone all silver, for he had that one
      gift of Heaven as recompense for his deformity, his long arms, big head,
      and short stature, a voice which gave you a shiver of delight and pain all
      at once. It had in it mystery and the incomprehensible. This
      drinking-song, hummed just above his breath, touched some antique memory
      in Monsieur Garen the avocat, and he nodded kindly at the dwarf, though he
      refused the wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, M'sieu' le Cure," said Parpon, ducking his head to avoid the hand
      that Medallion would have laid on it, "we're going to be somebody now in
      Pontiac, bless the Lord! We're simple folk, but we're not neglected. He
      wears a ribbon on his breast, M'sieu' le Cure!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was true. Fastened by a gold bar to the stranger's breast was the
      ribbon of an order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure smiled at Parpon's words, and looked curiously and gravely at the
      stranger. Tall Medallion the auctioneer took a glass of the wine, and,
      lifting it, said: "Who shall I drink to, Parpon, my dear? What is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten to one, a dauphin or a fool," answered Parpon, with a laugh like the
      note of an organ. "Drink to both, Long-legs." Then he trotted away to the
      Little Chemist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, my friend!" said he, and he drew the other's ear down to his mouth.
      "Now there'll be plenty of work for you. We're going to be gay in Pontiac.
      We'll come to you with our spoiled stomachs." He edged round the circle,
      and back to where the miller his master and the young Seigneur stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make more fine flour, old man," said he to the miller; "pates are the
      thing now." Then, to Monsieur De la Riviere: "There's nothing like hot
      pennies and wine to make the world love you. But it's too late, too late
      for my young Seigneur!" he added in mockery, and again he began to hum in
      a sort of amiable derision:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "My little tender heart,
          O gai, vive le roi!
          My little tender heart,
          O gai, vive le roi!

          'Tis for a grand baron,
          Vive le roi, la reine!
          'Tis for a grand baron,
          Vive Napoleon!"
</pre>
    <p>
      The words of the last two lines swelled out far louder than the dwarf
      meant, for few save Medallion and Monsieur De la Riviere had ever heard
      him sing. His concert-house was the Rock of Red Pigeons, his favourite
      haunt, his other home, where, it was said, he met the Little Good Folk of
      the Scarlet Hills, and had gay hours with them. And this was a matter of
      awe to the timid habitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the words, "Vive Napoleon!" a hand touched him on the shoulder. He
      turned and saw the stranger looking at him intently, his eyes alight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sing it," he said softly, yet with an air of command. Parpon hesitated,
      shrank back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sing it," he insisted, and the request was taken up by others, till
      Parpon's face flushed with a sort of pleasurable defiance. The stranger
      stooped and whispered something in his ear. There was a moment's pause, in
      which the dwarf looked into the other's eyes with an intense curiosity&mdash;or
      incredulity&mdash;and then Medallion lifted the little man on to the
      railing of the veranda, and over the heads and into the hearts of the
      people there passed, in a divine voice, a song known to many, yet coming
      as a new revelation to them all:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "My mother promised it,
          O gai, rive le roi!
          My mother promised it,
          O gai, vive le roi!

          To a gentleman of the king,
          Vive le roi, la reine!
          To a gentleman of the king,
          Vive Napoleon!"
</pre>
    <p>
      This was chanted lightly, airily, with a sweetness almost absurd, coming
      as it did from so uncouth a musician. The last verses had a touch of
      pathos, droll yet searching:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "Oh, say, where goes your love?
          O gai, rive le roi!
          Oh, say, where goes your love?
          O gai, vive le roi!
          He rides on a white horse,
          Vive le roi, la reine!
          He wears a silver sword,
          Vive Napoleon!

          "Oh, grand to the war he goes,
          O gai, vive le roi!
          Oh, grand to the war he goes,
          O gai, vive le roi!
          Gold and silver he will bring,
          Vive le roi, la reine;
          And eke the daughter of a king
          Vive Napoleon!"
The crowd&mdash;women and men, youths and maidens&mdash;enthusiastically repeated
again and again the last lines and the refrain, "Vive le roi, la reine!
Vive Napoleon!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the stranger stood, now looking at the singer with eager eyes,
      now searching the faces of the people, keen to see the effect upon them.
      His glance found the faces of the Cure, the avocat, and the auctioneer;
      and his eyes steadied to Medallion's humorous look, to the Cure's puzzled
      questioning, to the avocat's bird-like curiosity. It was plain they were
      not antagonistic (why should they be?); and he&mdash;was there any reason
      why he should care whether or no they were for him or against him?
    </p>
    <p>
      True, he had entered the village in the dead of night, with many packages
      and much luggage, had roused the people at the Louis Quinze, the driver
      who had brought him departing before daybreak gaily, because of the gifts
      of gold given him above his wage. True, this singular gentleman had taken
      three rooms in the Louis Quinze, had paid the landlord in advance, and had
      then gone to bed, leaving word that he was not to be waked till three
      o'clock the next afternoon. True, the landlord could not by any hint or
      indirection discover from whence his midnight visitor came. But if a
      gentleman paid his way, and was generous and polite, and minded his own
      business, wherefore should people busy themselves about him? When he
      appeared on the veranda of the inn with the hot pennies, not a half-dozen
      people in the village had known aught of his presence in Pontiac. The
      children came first, to scorch their fingers and fill their pockets, and
      after them the idle young men, and the habitants in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger having warmly shaken Parpon by the hand and again whispered
      in his ear, stepped forward. The last light of the setting sun was
      reflected from the red roof of the Little Chemist's shop upon the quaint
      figure and eloquent face, which had in it something of the gentleman,
      something of the comedian. The alert Medallion himself did not realise the
      touch of the comedian in him, till the white hand was waved
      grandiloquently over the heads of the crowd. Then something in the gesture
      corresponded with something in the face, and the auctioneer had a nut
      which he could not crack for many a day. The voice was musical,&mdash;as
      fine in speaking almost as the dwarf's in singing,&mdash;and the attention
      of the children was caught by the rich, vibrating tones. He addressed
      himself to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My children," he said, "my name is&mdash;Valmond! We have begun well; let
      us be better friends. I have come from far off to be one of you, to stay
      with you for awhile&mdash;who knows how long&mdash;how long?" He placed a
      finger meditatively on his lips, sending a sort of mystery into his look
      and bearing. "You are French, and so am I. You are playing on the shores
      of life, and so am I. You are beginning to think and dream, and so am I.
      We are only children till we begin to make our dreams our life. So I am
      one with you, for only now do I step from dream to action. My children,
      you shall be my brothers, and together we will sow the seed of action and
      reap the grain; we will make a happy garden of flowers, and violets shall
      bloom everywhere out of our dream&mdash;everywhere. Violets, my children,
      pluck the wild violets, and bring them to me, and I will give you silver
      for them, and I will love you. Never forget," he added, with a swelling
      voice, "that you owe your first duty to your mothers, and afterwards to
      your country, and to the spirit of France. I see afar"&mdash;he looked
      towards the setting sun, and stretched out his arm dramatically, yet such
      was the eloquence of his voice and person that not even the young Seigneur
      or Medallion smiled&mdash;"I see afar," he repeated, "the glory of our
      dreams fulfilled; after toil and struggle and loss: and I call upon you
      now to unfurl the white banner of justice and liberty and the
      restoration."
    </p>
    <p>
      The women who listened guessed little of what he meant by the fantastic
      sermon; but they wiped their eyes in sympathy, and gathered their children
      to them, and said, "Poor gentleman, poor gentleman!" and took him
      instantly to their hearts. The men were mystified, but wine and rhetoric
      had fired them, and they cheered him&mdash;no one knew why. The Cure, as
      he turned to leave, with Monsieur Garon, shook his head in bewilderment;
      but even he did not smile, for the man's eloquence had impressed him; and
      more than once he looked back at the dispersing crowd and the quaint
      figure posing on the veranda. The avocat was thinking deeply, and as, in
      the dusk, he left the Cure at his own door, all that he ventured was:
      "Singular&mdash;a most singular person!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall see, we shall see," said the Cure abstractedly, and they said
      good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medallion joined the Little Chemist in his shop door and watched the
      habitants scatter, till only Parpon and the stranger were left, and these
      two faced each other, and, without a word, passed into the hotel together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "H'm, h'm!" said Medallion into space, drumming the door-jamb with his
      fingers; "which is it, my Parpon&mdash;a dauphin, or a fool?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He and the Little Chemist talked long, their eyes upon the window
      opposite, inside which Monsieur Valmond and Parpon were in conference. Up
      the dusty street wandered fitfully the refrain:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "To a gentleman of the king,
          Vive Napoleon!"
</pre>
    <p>
      And once they dimly saw Monsieur Valmond come to the open window and
      stretch out his hand, as if in greeting to the song and the singer.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      This all happened on a Tuesday, and on Wednesday, and for several days,
      Valmond went about making friends. His pockets were always full of pennies
      and silver pieces, and he gave them liberally to the children and to the
      poor, though, indeed, there were few suffering poor in Pontiac. All had
      food enough to keep them from misery, though often it got no further than
      sour milk and bread, with a dash of sugar in it of Sundays, and now and
      then a little pork and molasses. As for homes, every man and woman had a
      house of a kind, with its low, projecting roof and dormer windows,
      according to the ability and prosperity of the owner. These houses were
      whitewashed, or painted white and red, and had double glass in winter,
      after the same measure. There was no question of warmth, for in snow-time
      every house was banked up with earth above the foundations, the cracks and
      intersections of windows and doors filled with cloth from the village
      looms; and wood was for the chopping far and near. Within these air-tight
      cubes these simple folk baked and were happy, content if now and then the
      housewife opened the one pane of glass which hung on a hinge, or the slit
      in the sash, to let in the cold air. As a rule, the occasional opening of
      the outer door to admit some one sufficed, for out rushed the hot blast,
      and in came the dry, frosty air to brace to their tasks the cheerful
      story-teller and singer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In summer the little fields were broken with wooden ploughs, followed by
      the limb of a tree for harrow, and the sickle, the scythe, and the flail
      to do their office in due course; and if the man were well-to-do, he swung
      the cradle in his rye and wheat, rejoicing in the sweep of the knife and
      the fulness of the swathe. Then, too, there was the driving of the rivers,
      when the young men ran the logs from the backwoods to the great mills near
      and far: red-shirted, sashed, knee-booted, with rings in their ears, and
      wide hats on their heads, and a song in their mouths, breaking a jamb, or
      steering a crib, or raft, down the rapids. And the voyageur also, who
      brought furs out of the North down the great lakes, came home again to
      Pontiac, singing in his patois:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "Nous avons passe le bois,
          Nous somm's a la rive!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Or, as he went forth:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "Le dieu du jour s'avance;
          Amis, les vents sont doux;
          Berces par l'esperance,
          Partons, embarquons-noun.
          A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a!"
</pre>
    <p>
      And, as we know, it was summer when Valmond came to Pontiac. The
      river-drivers were just beginning to return, and by and by the flax
      swingeing would begin in the little secluded valley by the river; and one
      would see, near and far, the bright sickle flashing across the gold and
      green area; and all the pleasant furniture of summer set forth in pride,
      by the Mother of the House whom we call Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond was alive to it all, almost too alive, for at first the
      flamboyancy of his spirit touched him off with melodrama. Yet, on the
      whole, he seemed at first more natural than involved or obscure. His love
      for children was real, his politeness to women spontaneous. He was seen to
      carry the load of old Madame Degardy up the hill, and place it at her own
      door. He also had offered her a pinch of snuff, which she acknowledged by
      gravely offering a pinch of her own from a dirty twist of brown paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he sprang over a fence, took from the hands of coquettish Elise
      Malboir an axe, and split the knot which she in vain had tried to break.
      Not satisfied with this, he piled full of wood the stone oven outside the
      house, and carried water for her from the spring. This came from natural
      kindness, for he did not see the tempting look she gave him, nor the
      invitation in her eye, as he turned to leave her. He merely asked her
      name. But after he had gone, as though he had forgotten, or remembered,
      something, he leaped the fence again, came up to her with an air of
      half-abstraction, half-courtesy, took both her hands in his, and, before
      she could recover herself, kissed her on the cheeks in a paternal sort of
      way, saying, "Adieu, adieu, my child!" and left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The act had condescension in it; yet, too, something unconsciously simple
      and primitive. Parpon the dwarf, who that moment perched himself on the
      fence, could not decide which Valmond was just then&mdash;dauphin or fool.
      Valmond did not see the little man, but swung away down the dusty road,
      reciting to himself couplets from 'Le Vieux Drapeau':
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       "Oh, come, my flag, come, hope of mine,
        And thou shalt dry these fruitless tears;"
</pre>
    <p>
      and apparently, without any connection, he passed complacently to an
      entirely different song:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       "She loved to laugh, she loved to drink,
        I bought her jewels fine."
</pre>
    <p>
      Then he added, with a suddenness which seemed to astound himself,&mdash;for
      afterwards he looked round quickly, as if to see if he had been heard,&mdash;"Elise
      Malboir&mdash;h'm! a pretty name, Elise; but Malboir&mdash;tush! it should
      be Malbarre; the difference between Lombardy cider and wine of the
      Empire."
    </p>
    <p>
      Parpon, left behind, sat on the fence with his legs drawn up to his chin,
      looking at Elise, till she turned and caught the provoking light of his
      eye. She flushed, then was cool again, for she was put upon her mettle by
      the suggestion of his glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, lazy-bones," she said; "come fetch me currants from the garden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, mocking-bird," answered he; "come peck me on the cheek."
    </p>
    <p>
      She tossed her head and struck straight home. "It isn't a game of pass it
      on from gentleman to beetle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think he's a gentleman?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As sure as I think you're a beetle."
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, took off his cap, and patted himself on the head. "Parpon,
      Parpon!" said he, "if Jean Malboir could see you now, he'd put his foot on
      you and crush you&mdash;dirty beetle!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At the mention of her father's name a change passed over Elise; for this
      same Parpon, when all men else were afraid, had saved Jean Malboir's life
      at a log chute in the hills. When he died, Parpon was nearer to him than
      the priest, and he loved to hear the dwarf chant his wild rhythms of the
      Little Good Folk of the Scarlet Hills, more than to listen to holy
      prayers. Elise, who had a warm, impulsive nature, in keeping with her
      black eyes and tossing hair, who was all fire and sun and heart and
      temper, ran over and caught the dwarf round the neck, and kissed him on
      the cheek, dashing the tears out of her eyes, as she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm a cat, I'm a bad-tempered thing, Parpon; I hate myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, shook his shaggy head, and pushed her away the length of his
      long, strong arms. "Bosh!" said he; "you're a puss and no cat, and I like
      you better for the claws. If you hate yourself, you'll get a big penance.
      Hate the ugly like Parpon, not the pretty like you. The one's no sin, the
      other is."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was beside the open door of the oven; and it would be hard to tell
      whether her face was suffering from heat or from blushes. However that
      might chance, her mouth was soft and sweet, and her eyes were still wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is he, Parpon?" she asked, not looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he like Duclosse the mealman, or Lajeunesse the blacksmith, or Garotte
      the lime-burner-and the rest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course not," she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he like the Cure, or Monsieur De la Riviere, or Monsieur Garon, or
      Monsieur Medallion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's different," she said hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better or worse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More&mdash;more"&mdash;she did not know what to say&mdash;"more
      interesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he like the Judge Honourable that comes from Montreal, or the grand
      Governor, or the General that travels with the Governor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but different&mdash;more&mdash;more like us in some things, like
      them in others, and more&mdash;splendid. He speaks such fine things! You
      mind the other night at the Louis Quinze. He is like&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused. "What is he like?" Parpon asked slyly, enjoying her
      difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I know," she answered; "he is a little like Madame the American who
      came two years ago. There is something&mdash;something!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Parpon laughed again. "Like Madame Chalice from New York&mdash;fudge!" Yet
      he eyed her as if he admired her penetration. "How?" he urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know&mdash;quite," she answered, a little pettishly. "But I used
      to see Madame go off in the woods, and she would sit hour by hour, and
      listen to the waterfall, and talk to the birds, and at herself too; and
      more than once I saw her shut her hands&mdash;like that! You remember what
      tiny hands she had?" (She glanced at her own brown ones unconsciously.)
      "And she spoke out, her eyes running with tears&mdash;and she all in
      pretty silks, and a colour like a rose. She spoke out like this: 'Oh, if I
      could only do something, something, some big thing! What is all this silly
      coming and going to me, when I know, I know I might do it, if I had the
      chance! O Harry, Harry, can't you see!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harry was her husband. Ah, what a fisherman was he!" said Parpon,
      nodding. "What did she mean by doing 'big things'?" he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do I know?" she asked fretfully. "But Monsieur Valmond seems to me
      like her, just the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur Valmond is a great man," said Parpon slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know!" she cried; "you know! Oh, tell me, what is he? Who is he?
      Where does he come from? Why is he here? How long will he stay? Tell me,
      how long will he stay?" She caught flutteringly at Parpon's shoulder. "You
      remember what I sang the other night?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," she answered quickly. "Oh, how beautiful it was! Ah, Parpon,
      why don't you sing for us oftener, and all the world would love you, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't love the world," he retorted gruffly; "and I'll sing for the
      devil" (she crossed herself) "as soon as for silly gossips in Pontiac."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well!" she asked; "what had your song to do with him, with Monsieur
      Valmond?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think hard, my dear," he said, with mystery in his look. Then, breaking
      off: "Madame Chalice is coming back to-day; the Manor House is open, and
      you should see how they fly round up there." He nodded towards the hill
      beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pontiac'll be a fine place by and by," she said, for she had village
      patriotism deep in her veins. Had not her people lived there long before
      the conquest by the English?
    </p>
    <p>
      "But tell me, tell me what your song had to do with Monsieur," she urged
      again. "It's a pretty song, but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think about it," he answered provokingly. "Adieu, my child!" he went on
      mockingly, using Valmond's words, and catching both her hands as he had
      done; then, springing upon a bench by the oven, he kissed her on both
      cheeks. "Adieu, my child!" he said again, and, jumping down, trotted away
      out into the road. Back to her, from the dust he made as he shuffled away,
      there came the words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "Gold and silver he will bring,
          Vive le roi, la reine!
          And eke the daughter of a king
          Vive Napoleon!"
</pre>
    <p>
      She went about her work, the song in her ears, and the words of the
      refrain beat in and out, out and in:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vive Napoleon." Her brow was troubled, and she perched her head on this
      side and on that, as she tried to guess what the dwarf had meant. At last
      she sat down on a bench at the door of her home, and the summer afternoon
      spent its glories on her; for the sunflowers and the hollyhocks were round
      her, and the warmth gave her face a shining health and joyousness. There
      she brooded till she heard the voice of her mother calling across the
      meadow; then she got up with a sigh, and softly repeated Parpon's words:
      "He is a great man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of that night she started up from a sound sleep, and, with a
      little cry, whispered into the silence: "Napoleon&mdash;Napoleon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was thinking of Valmond. A revelation had come to her out of her
      dreams. But she laughed at it, and buried her face in her pillow and went
      to sleep, hoping to dream again.

      In less than one week Valmond was as outstanding from Pontiac as Dalgrothe
      Mountain, just beyond it in the south. His liberality, his jocundity, his
      occasional abstraction, his meditative pose, were all his own; his humour
      that of the people. He was too quick in repartee and drollery for a
      bourgeois, too "near to the bone" in point for an aristocrat, with his
      touch of the comedian and the peasant also. Besides, he was mysterious and
      picturesque, and this is alluring to women and to the humble, if not to
      all the world. It might be his was the comedian's fascination, but the
      flashes of grotesqueness rather pleased the eye than hurt the taste of
      Pontiac.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only in one quarter was there hesitation, added to an anxiety almost
      painful; for to doubt Monsieur Valmond would have shocked the sense of
      courtesy so dear to Monsieur the Cure, Monsieur Garon, the Little Chemist,
      and even Medallion the auctioneer, who had taken into his bluff, odd
      nature something of the spirit of those old-fashioned gentlemen. Monsieur
      De la Riviere, the young Seigneur, had to be reckoned with independently.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was their custom to meet once a week, at the house of one or another,
      for a "causerie," as the avocat called it. On the Friday evening of this
      particular week, all were seated in the front garden of the Cure's house,
      as Valmond came over the hill, going towards the Louis Quinze. His step
      was light, his head laid slightly to one side, as if in pleased and
      inquiring reverie, and there was a lifting of one corner of the mouth,
      suggesting an amused disdain. Was it that disdain which comes from
      conquest not important enough to satisfy ambition? The social conquest of
      a village&mdash;to be conspicuous and attract the groundlings in this tiny
      theatre of life, that seemed little!
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond appeared not to see the little coterie, but presently turned, when
      just opposite the gate, and, raising his hat, half paused. Then, without
      more ado, he opened the gate and advanced to the outstretched hand of the
      Cure, who greeted him with a courtly affability. He shook hands with, and
      nodded good-humouredly at, Medallion and the Little Chemist, bowed to the
      avocat, and touched off his greeting to Monsieur De la Riviere with
      deliberation, not offering his hand&mdash;this very reserve a sign of
      equality not lost on the young Seigneur. He had not this stranger at any
      particular advantage, as he had wished, he knew scarcely why. Valmond took
      the seat offered him beside the Cure, who remarked presently:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear friend, Monsieur Garon, was saying just now that the spirit of
      France has ever been the Captain of Freedom among the nations."
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond glanced quickly from the Cure to the others, a swift, inquisitive
      look, then settled back in his chair, and turned, bowing, towards Monsieur
      Garon. The avocat's pale face flushed, his long, thin fingers twined round
      each other and untwined, and presently he said, in his little chirping
      voice, so quaint as to be almost unreal:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was saying that the spirit of France lived always ahead of the time,
      was ever first to conceive the feeling of the coming century, and by its
      own struggles and sufferings&mdash;sometimes too abrupt and perilous&mdash;made
      easy the way for the rest of the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      During these words a change passed over Valmond. His restless body became
      still, his mobile face steady and almost set&mdash;all the life of him
      seemed to have burnt into his eyes; but he answered nothing, and the Cure,
      in the pause, was constrained to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our dear Monsieur Garon knows perfectly the history of France, and is
      devoted to the study of the Napoleonic times and of the Great Revolution&mdash;alas
      for our people and the saints of Holy Church who perished then!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The avocat lifted a hand in mute disacknowledgment. Again there was a
      silence, and out of the pause Monsieur De la Riviere's voice was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur Valmond, how fares this spirit of France now&mdash;you come from
      France?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a shadow of condescension and ulterior meaning in De la
      Riviere's voice, for he had caught the tricks of the poseur in this
      singular gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond did not stir, but looked steadily at De la Riviere, and said
      slowly, dramatically, yet with a strange genuineness also:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The spirit of France, monsieur, the spirit of France looks not forward
      only, but backward, for her inspiration. It is as ready for action now as
      when the old order was dragged from Versailles to Paris, and in Paris to
      the guillotine, when France got a principle and waited, waited&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not finish his sentence, but threw back his head with a sort of
      reflective laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Waited for what?" asked the young Seigneur, trying to conquer his
      dislike.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the Man!" came the quick reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The avocat rubbed his hands in pleasure. He instantly divined one who knew
      his subject, though he talked this melodramatically: a thing not uncommon
      among the habitants and the professional story-tellers, but scarcely the
      way of the coterie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes, yes," he said, "for&mdash;? monsieur, for&mdash;?" He paused, as
      if to give himself the delight of hearing their visitor speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For Napoleon," was the abrupt reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes, dear Lord, yes&mdash;a Napoleon&mdash;of&mdash;of the Empire.
      France can only cherish an idea when a man is behind it, when a man lives
      it, embodies it. She must have heroes. She is a poet, a poet&mdash;and an
      actress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So said the Man, Napoleon," cried Valmond, getting to his feet. "He said
      that to Barras, to Remusat, to Josephine, to Lucien, to&mdash;to another,
      when France had for the moment lost her idea&mdash;and her man."
    </p>
    <p>
      The avocat trembled to his feet to meet Valmond, who stood up as he spoke,
      his face shining with enthusiasm, a hand raised in broad dramatic gesture,
      a dignity come upon him, in contrast to the figure which had disported
      itself through the village during the past week. The avocat had found a
      man after his own heart. He knew that Valmond understood whereof he spoke.
      It was as if an artist saw a young genius use a brush on canvas for a
      moment; a swordsman watch an unknown master of the sword. It was not so
      much the immediate act, as the divination, the rapport, the spirit behind
      the act, which could only come from the soul of the real thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you, monsieur; I thank you with all my heart," the avocat said.
      "It is the true word you have spoken."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a lad came running to fetch the Little Chemist, and Medallion and he
      departed, but not without the auctioneer having pressed Valmond's hand
      warmly, for he was quick of emotion, and, like the avocat, he recognised,
      as he thought, the true word behind the dramatic trappings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Garon and Valmond talked on, eager, responsive, Valmond lost in
      the discussion of Napoleon, Garon in the man before him. By pregnant
      allusions, by a map drawn hastily on the ground here, and an explosion of
      secret history there, did Valmond win to a sort of worship this fine
      little Napoleonic scholar, who had devoured every book on his hero which
      had come in his way since boyhood. Student as he was, he had met a man
      whose knowledge of the Napoleonic life was vastly more intricate,
      searching and vital than his own. He, Monsieur Garon, spoke as from a book
      or out of a library, but this man as from the Invalides, or, since that is
      anachronistic, from the lonely rock of St. Helena. A private saying of
      Napoleon's, a word from his letters and biography, a phrase out of his
      speeches to his soldiers, sent tears to the avocat's eyes, and for a
      moment transformed Valmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they talked, the Cure and the young Seigneur listened, and there
      passed into their minds the same wonder that had perplexed Elise Malboir;
      so that they were troubled, as was she, each after his own manner and
      temperament. Their reasoning, their feelings were different, but they were
      coming to the point the girl had reached when she cried into the darkness
      of the night, "Napoleon&mdash;Napoleon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat forgetful of the passing of time, the Cure preening with pleasure
      because of Valmond's remarks upon the Church when quoting the First
      Napoleon's praise of religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a carriage came dashing up the hill, with four horses and a
      postilion. The avocat was in the house searching for a book. De la
      Riviere, seeing the carriage first, got to his feet with instant
      excitement, and the others turned to look. As it neared the house, the
      Cure took off his baretta, and smiled expectantly, a little red spot
      burning on both cheeks. These deepened as the carriage stopped, and a
      lady, a little lady like a golden flower, with sunny eyes and face&mdash;how
      did she keep so fresh in their dusty roads?&mdash;stood up impulsively,
      and before any one could reach the gate was entering herself, her blue
      eyes swimming with the warmth of a kind heart&mdash;or a warm temperament,
      which may exist without a kind heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it the heart, or the temperament, or both, that sent her forward with
      hands outstretched, saying: "Ah, my dear, dear Cure, how glad I am to see
      you once again! It is two years too long, dear Cure."
    </p>
    <p>
      She held his hand in both of hers, and looked up into his eyes with a
      smile at once child-like and naive&mdash;and masterful; for behind the
      simplicity and the girlish manner there was a power, a mind, with which
      this sweet golden hair and cheeks like a rose-garden had nothing to do.
      The Cure, beaming, touched by her warmth, and by her tiny caressing
      fingers, stooped and kissed them both like an old courtier. He had come of
      a good family in France long ago, very long ago,&mdash;and even in this
      French-Canadian village; where he had taught and served and lingered forty
      years, he had kept the graces of his youth, and this beautiful woman drew
      them all out. Since his arrival in Pontiac, he had never kissed a woman's
      hand&mdash;women had kissed his; and this woman was a Protestant, like
      Medallion!
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning from the Cure, she held out a hand to the young Seigneur with a
      little casual air, as if she had but seen him yesterday, and said:
      "Monsieur De la Riviere&mdash;what, still buried?&mdash;and the world
      waiting for the great touch! But we in Pontiac gain what the world loses."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to the Cure again, and said, placing a hand upon his arm:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could not pass without stepping in upon my dear old friend, even though
      soiled and unpresentable. But you forgive that, don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame is always welcome, and always unspotted of the dusty world," he
      answered gallantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught his fingers in hers as might a child, turned full upon Valmond,
      and waited. The Cure instantly presented Valmond to her. She looked at him
      brightly, alluringly, apparently so simply; yet her first act showed the
      perception behind that rosy and golden face, and the demure eyes whose
      lids languished now and then&mdash;to the unknowing with an air of
      coquetry, to the knowing&mdash;did any know her?&mdash;as one would shade
      one's eyes to see a landscape clearly, or make out a distant figure. As
      Valmond bowed, a thought seemed to fetch down the pink eyelids, and she
      stretched out her hand, which he took and kissed, while she said in
      English, though they had been talking in French:
    </p>
    <p>
      "A traveller too, like myself, Monsieur Valmond? But Pontiac&mdash;why
      Pontiac?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A furtive, inquiring look shot from the eyes of the young Seigneur, a
      puzzled glance from the Cure's, as they watched Valmond; for they did not
      know that he had knowledge of English; he had not spoken it to Medallion,
      who had sent into his talk several English words. How did this woman
      divine it?
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange suspicion flashed into Valmond's face, but it was gone on the
      instant, and he replied quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madame, a traveller; and for Pontiac&mdash;there is as much earth
      and sky about Pontiac as about Paris or London or New York."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But people count, Monsieur-Valmond."
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated before the name, as if trying to remember, though she
      recalled perfectly. It was her tiny fashion to pique, to appear unknowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly, Madame Chalice," he answered instantly, for he did not yield to
      the temptation to pause before her name; "but sometimes the few are as
      important to us as the many&mdash;eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She almost started at the eh, for it broke in grimly upon the gentlemanly
      flavour of his speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If my reasons for coming were only as good as madame's&mdash;" he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who knows!" she said, with her eyes resting idly on his flowered
      waistcoat, and dropping to the incongruous enamelled knee-boots with their
      red tassels. She turned to the Cure again, but not till Valmond had added:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or the same&mdash;who knows?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she looked at him with drooping eyelids and a slight smile so full
      of acid possibilities that De la Riviere drew in a sibilant breath of
      delight. Her movement had been as towards an impertinence; but as she
      caught Valmond's eye, something in it, so really boylike, earnest, and
      free from insolence, met hers, that, with a little way she had, she laid
      back her head slowly, her lips parted in a sweet, ambiguous smile, her
      eyes dwelt on him with a humorous interest, or flash of purpose, and she
      said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody knows&mdash;eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not resist the delicate malice of the exclamation, she imitated
      the gaucherie so delightfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond did not fail to see her meaning, but he was too wise to show it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hardly knew how it was he had answered her unhesitatingly in English,
      for it had been his purpose to avoid speaking English in Pontiac.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Madame Chalice caught sight of Monsieur Garon coming from the
      house. When he saw her, he stopped short in delighted surprise. Gathering
      up her skirts, she ran to him, put both hands on his shoulders, kissed him
      on the cheek, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur Garon, Monsieur Garon, my good avocat, my Solon! are the coffee,
      and the history, and the blest madeira still chez-toi?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no jealousy in the Cure; he smiled at the scene with great
      benevolence, for he was as a brother to Monsieur Garon. If he had any good
      thing, it was his first wish to share it with him; even to taking him
      miles away to some simple home where a happy thing had come to poor folk&mdash;the
      return of a prodigal son, a daughter's fortunate marriage, or the birth of
      a child to childless people; and there together they exchanged pinches of
      snuff over the event, and made compliments from the same mould, nor
      desired difference of pattern. To the pretty lady's words, Monsieur Garon
      blushed, and his thin hand fluttered to his lips. As if in sympathy, the
      Cure's fingers trembled to his cassock cord. "Madame, dear madame,"&mdash;the
      Cure approved by a caressing nod, "we are all the same here in our hearts
      and in our homes, and if anything seem good in them to us, it is because
      you are pleased. You bring sunshine and relish to our lives, dear madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure beamed. This was after his own heart and he had ever said that
      his dear avocat would have been a brilliant orator, were it not for his
      retiring spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      For himself, he was no speaker at all; he could only do his duty and love
      his people. So he had declared over and over again, and the look in his
      eyes said the same now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame's eyes were shining with tears. This admiration of her was too real
      to be doubted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet&mdash;and yet"&mdash;she said, with a hand in the Cure's and the
      avocat's, drawing them near her&mdash;"a heretic, a heretic, my dear
      friends! How should I stand in your hearts if I were only of your faith?
      Or is it so that you yearn over the lost sheep, more than over the ninety
      and nine of the fold?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a real moisture in her eyes, and in her own heart she wondered,
      this fresh and venturing spirit, if she cared for them as they seemed to
      care for her&mdash;for she felt she had an inherent strain of the actress
      temperament, while these honest provincials were wholly real.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if she made them happy by her gaiety, what matter! The tears dried,
      and she flashed a malicious look at the young Seigneur, as though to say:
      "You had your chance, and you made nothing of it, and these simple
      gentlemen have done the gracious thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was a liberal interpretation of his creed which prompted the
      Cure to add with a quaint smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Thou art not far from the Kingdom,' my daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      The avocat, who had no vanity, hastened to add to his former remarks, as
      if he had been guilty of an oversight:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear madame, you have flattered my poor gleanings in history; I am happy
      to tell you that there is here another and a better pilot in that sea. It
      is Monsieur Valmond," he added, his voice chirruping in his pleasure. "For
      Napoleon&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Napoleon&mdash;yes, Napoleon?" she said, turning to Valmond, with a
      look half of interest, half of incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "&mdash;For Napoleon is, through him, a revelation," the avocat went on.
      "He fills in the vague spaces, clears up mysteries of incident, and gives,
      instead, mystery of character."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed," she added, still incredulous, but interested in this bizarre
      figure who had so worked upon her old friend, interested because she had a
      keen scent for mystery, and instinctively felt it here before her. Like De
      la Riviere, she perceived a strange combination of the gentleman and&mdash;something
      else; but, unlike him, she saw also a light in the face and eyes that
      might be genius, poetry, adventure. For the incongruities, what did they
      matter to her? She wished to probe life, to live it, to race the whole
      gamut of inquiry, experiences, follies, loves, and sacrifices, to squeeze
      the orange dry, and then to die while yet young, having gone the full
      compass, the needle pointing home. She was as broad as sumptuous in her
      nature; so what did a gaucherie matter? or a dash of the Oriental in a
      citizen of the Occident?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then we must set the centuries right, and so on&mdash;if you will come to
      see me when I am settled at the Manor," she added, with soft raillery, to
      Valmond. He bowed, expressed his pleasure a little oracularly, and was
      about to say something else, but she turned deftly to De la Riviere, with
      a sweetness which made up for her previous irony to him, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, my kind Seigneur, will come to breakfast with me one day? My husband
      will be here soon. When you see our flag flying, you will find the table
      always laid for four."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then to the Cure and the avocat: "You shall visit me whenever you will,
      and you are to wait for nothing, or I shall come to fetch you. Voila! I am
      so glad to see you. And now, dear Cure, will you take me to my carriage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon there was a surf of dust rising behind the carriage, hiding her; but
      four men, left behind in the little garden, stood watching, as if they
      expected to see a vision in rose and gold rise from it; and each was
      smiling unconsciously.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since Friday night the good Cure, in his calm, philosophical way, had
      brooded much over the talk in the garden upon France, the Revolution, and
      Napoleon. As a rule, his sermons were commonplace almost to a classical
      simplicity, but there were times when, moved by some new theme, he talked
      to the villagers as if they, like himself, were learned and wise. He
      thought of his old life in France, of two Napoleons that he had seen, and
      of the time when, at Neuilly, a famous general burst into his father's
      house, and, with streaming tears, cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is dead&mdash;he is dead&mdash;at St. Helena&mdash;Napoleon! Oh,
      Napoleon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A chapter from Isaiah came to the Cure's mind. He brought out his Bible
      from the house, and, walking up and down, read aloud certain passages.
      They kept singing in his ears all day
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large
   country: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of thy glory
   shall be the shame of thy lord's house....

   And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant
   Eliakim the son of Hilkiah

   And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy
   girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand....
   And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for
   a glorious throne to his father's house.

   And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house,
   the offspring and the issue....
</pre>
    <p>
      He looked very benign as he quoted these verses in the pulpit on Sunday
      morning, with a half smile, as of pleased meditation. He was lost to the
      people before him, and when he began to speak, it was as in soliloquy. He
      was talking to a vague audience, into that space where a man's eyes look
      when he is searching his own mind, discovering it to himself. The
      instability of earthly power, the putting down of the great, their exile
      and chastening, and their restoration in their own persons, or in the
      persons of their descendants&mdash;this was his subject. He brought the
      application down to their own rude, simple life, then returned with it to
      a higher plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, as if the memories of France, "beloved and incomparable,"
      overcame him, he dwelt upon the bitter glory of the Revolution. Then, with
      a sudden flush, he spoke of Napoleon. At that name the church became
      still, and the dullest habitant listened intently. Napoleon was in the air&mdash;a
      curious sequence to the song that was sung on the night of Valmond's
      arrival, when a phrase was put in the mouths of the parish, which gave
      birth to a personal reality. "Vive Napoleon!" had been on every lip this
      week, and it was an easy step from a phrase to a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure spoke with pensive dignity of Napoleon's past career, his work
      for France, his too proud ambition, behind which was his great love of
      country; and how, for chastening, God turned upon him violently and tossed
      him like a ball into the wide land of exile, from which he came out no
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," continued the calm voice, "his spirit, stripped of the rubbish of
      this quarrelsome world, and freed from the spite of foes, comes out from
      exile and lives in our France to-day&mdash;for she is still ours, though
      we find peace and bread to eat, under another flag. And in these troubled
      times, when France needs a man, even as a barren woman a child to be the
      token of her womanhood, it may be that one sprung from the loins of the
      Great Napoleon may again give life to the principle which some have sought
      to make into a legend. Even as the deliverer came out of obscure Corsica,
      so from some outpost of France, where the old watchwords still are called,
      may rise another Napoleon, whose mission will be civic glory and peace
      alone, the champion of the spirit of France, defending it against the
      unjust. He shall be fastened as a nail in a sure place, as a glorious
      throne to his father's house."
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned over the pulpit, and, pausing, looked down at his congregation.
      Then, all at once, he was aware that he had created a profound impression.
      Just in front of him, his eyes burning with a strange fire, sat Monsieur
      Valmond. Parpon, beside him, hung over the back of a seat, his long arms
      stretched out, his hands applauding in a soundless way. Beneath the sword
      of Louis the Martyr, the great treasure of the parish, presented to this
      church by Marie Antoinette, sat Monsieur Garon, his thin fingers pressed
      to his mouth as if to stop a sound. Presently, out of pure spontaneity,
      there ran through the church like a soft chorus:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "O, say, where goes your love?
          O gai, vive le roi!
          He wears a silver sword,
          Vive Napoleon!"
</pre>
    <p>
      The thing was unprecedented. Who had started it? Afterwards some said it
      was Parpon, the now chosen comrade&mdash;or servant&mdash;of Valmond, who,
      people said, had given himself up to the stranger, body and soul; but no
      one could swear to that. Shocked, and taken out of his dream, the Cure
      raised his hand against the song. "Hush, hush, my children!" he said.
      "Hush, I command you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the sight of the upraised hands, more than the Cure's voice, which
      stilled the outburst. Those same hands had sprinkled the holy water in the
      sacrament of baptism, had blessed man and maid at the altar, had quieted
      the angry arm lifted to strike, had anointed the brow of the dying, and
      laid a crucifix on breasts which had ceased to harbour breath and care and
      love, and all things else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence fell. In another moment the Cure finished his sermon, but not till
      his eyes had again met those of Valmond, and there had passed into his
      mind a sudden, startling thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unconsciously the Cure had declared himself the patron of all that made
      Pontiac for ever a notable spot in the eyes of three nations: and if he
      repented of it, no man ever knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      During mass and the sermon Valmond had sat very still, once or twice
      smiling curiously at thought of how, inactive himself, the gate of destiny
      was being opened up for him. Yet he had not been all inactive. He had paid
      much attention to his toilet, selecting, with purpose, the white
      waistcoat, the long, blue-grey coat cut in a fashion anterior to this time
      by thirty years or more, and particularly to the arrangement of his hair.
      He resembled Napoleon&mdash;not the later Napoleon, but the Bonaparte,
      lean, shy, laconic, who fought at Marengo; and this had startled the Cure
      in his pulpit, and the rest of the little coterie.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Madame Chalice, sitting not far from Elise Malboir, had seen the
      resemblance in the Cure's garden on Friday evening; and though she had
      laughed at it, for, indeed, the matter seemed ludicrous enough at first,&mdash;the
      impression had remained. She was no Catholic, she did not as a rule care
      for religious services; but there was interest in the air, she was
      restless, the morning was inviting, she was reverent of all true
      expression of life and feeling, though a sad mocker in much; and so she
      had come to the little church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following Elise's intent look, she read with amusement the girl's budding
      romance, and was then suddenly arrested by the head of Valmond, now half
      turned towards her. It had, indeed, a look of the First Napoleon. Was it
      the hair? Yes, it must be; but the head was not so square, so firm set;
      and what a world of difference in the grand effect! The one had been
      distant, splendid, brooding (so she glorified him); the other was an
      impressionist imitation, with dash, form, poetry, and colour. But where
      was the great strength? It was lacking. The close association of Parpon
      and Valmond&mdash;that was droll; yet, too, it had a sort of fitness, she
      knew scarcely why. However, Monsieur was not a fool, in the vulgar sense,
      for he had made a friend of a little creature who could be a wasp or a
      humming-bird, as he pleased. Then, too, this stranger had conquered her
      dear avocat; had won the hearts of the mothers and daughters&mdash;her own
      servants talked of no one else; had captured this pretty Elise Malboir;
      had caused the young men to imitate his walk and retail his sayings; had
      won from herself an invitation to visit her; and now had made an
      unconscious herald and champion of an innocent old Cure, and set a whole
      congregation singing "Vive Napoleon" after mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Napoleon? She threw back her pretty head, laughed softly, and fanned
      herself. Napoleon? Why, of course there could be no real connection; the
      man was an impostor, a base impostor, playing upon the credulities of a
      secluded village. Absurd&mdash;and interesting! So interesting, she did
      not resent the attention given to Valmond, to the exclusion of herself;
      though to speak truly, her vanity desired not admiration more than is
      inherent in the race of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she was very dainty this morning, good to look at, and refreshing,
      with everything in flower-like accord; simple in general effect, yet with
      touches of the dramatic here and there&mdash;in the little black patch on
      the delicate health of her cheek, in the seductive arrangements of her
      laces. She loved dress, all the vanities, but she had something above it
      all&mdash;an imaginative mind, certain of whose faculties had been
      sharpened to a fine edge of cleverness and wit. For she was but
      twenty-three; with the logic of a woman of fifty, without its setness and
      lack of elasticity. She went straight for the hearts of things, while yet
      she glittered upon the surface. This was why Valmond interested her&mdash;not
      as a man, a physical personality, but as a mystery to be probed,
      discovered. Sentiment? Coquetry? Not with him. That for less interesting
      men, she said to herself. Why should a point or two of dress and manners
      affect her unpleasantly? She ought to be just, to remember that there was
      a touch of the fantastic, of the barbaric, in all genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he a genius? For an instant she almost thought he was, when she saw
      the people make way for him to pass out of the church, as though he were a
      great personage, Parpon trotting behind him. He carried himself with true
      appreciation of the incident, acknowledging more by look than by sign this
      courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word," she said, "he has them in his pocket." Then, unconsciously
      plagiarising Parpon: "Prince or barber&mdash;a toss-up!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, many had gathered round Medallion. The auctioneer, who liked the
      unique thing and was not without tact, having the gift of humour, took on
      himself the office of inquisitor, even as there rose again little snatches
      of "Vive Napoleon" from the crowd. He approached Valmond, who was moving
      on towards the Louis Quinze, with appreciation of a time for disappearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We know you, sir," said Medallion, "as Monsieur Valmond; but there are
      those who think you would let us address you by a name better known&mdash;indeed,
      the name dear to all Frenchmen. If it be so, will you not let us call you
      Napoleon" (he took off his hat, and Valmond did the same), "and will you
      tell us what we may do for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Chalice, a little way off, watched Valmond closely. He stood a
      moment in a quandary, yet he was not outwardly nervous, and he answered
      presently, with an air of empressement:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur, my friends, I am in the hands of fate. I am dumb. Fate speaks
      for me. But we shall know each other better; and I trust you, who, as
      Frenchmen, descended from a better day in France, will not betray me. Let
      us be patient till Destiny strikes the hour." Now for the first time
      to-day Valmond saw Madame Chalice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could have done no better thing to serve him than to hold out her
      hand, and say in her clear tones, which had, too, a fascinating sort of
      monotony:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur, if you are idle Friday afternoon, perhaps you will bestow on me
      a half-hour at the Manor; and I will try to make half mine no bad one."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was keen enough to feel the delicacy of the point through the deftness
      of the phrase; and what he said and what he did now had no pose, but sheer
      gratitude. With a few gracious words to Medallion, she bowed and drove
      away, leaving Valmond in the midst of an admiring crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was launched on an adventure as whimsical as tragical, if he was an
      impostor; and if he was not, as pathetic as droll. He was scarcely
      conscious that Parpon walked beside him, till the dwarf said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold on, my dauphin, you walk too fast for your poor fool."
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      From this hour Valmond was carried on by a wave of fortune. Before vespers
      on that Sunday night, it was common talk that he was a true son of the
      Great Napoleon, born at St. Helena.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did he come to Pontiac? He wished to be in retirement till his
      friends, acting for him in France, gave him the signal, and then with a
      small army of French-Canadians he would land in France. Thousands would
      gather round his standard, and so marching on to Paris, the Napoleonic
      faith would be revived, and he would come into his own. It is possible
      that these stories might have been traced to Parpon, but he had covered up
      his trail so well that no one followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that Sunday night, young men and old flocked into Valmond's chambers at
      the Louis Quinze, shook hands with him, addressing him as "Your
      Excellency" or "Your Highness." He maintained towards them a mysterious
      yet kindly reserve, singularly effective. They inspected the martial
      furnishing of the room: the drum, the pair of rifles, the pistols, in the
      corner, the sabres crossed on the wall, the gold-handled sword that lay
      upon the table, and the picture of Napoleon on a white horse against the
      wall. Tobacco and wine were set upon a side table, and every man as he
      passed out took a glass of wine and enough tobacco for his pipe, and said:
      "Of grace, your health, monseigneur!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There were those who scoffed, who from natural habit disbelieved, and
      nodded knowingly, and whispered in each other's ears; but these were in
      the minority; and all the women and children declared for this new "Man of
      Destiny." And when some foolish body asked him for a lock of his hair, and
      old Madame Degardy (crazy Joan, as she was called) followed, offering him
      a pinch of snuff, and a lad appeared with a bunch of violets from Madame
      Chalice, the dissentients were cast in shadow, and had no longer courage
      to doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Chalice had been merely whimsical in sending these violets, which
      her gardener had brought her that very morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will help along the pretty farce," she had said to herself; and then
      she sat her down to read Napoleon's letters to Josephine, and to wonder
      that a woman could have been faithless and vile with such a man. Her blood
      raced indignantly in her veins as she thought of it. She admired
      intellect, supremacy, the gifts of temperament, deeds of war and adventure
      beyond all. As yet her brain was stronger than her feelings; there had
      been no breakers of emotion in her life. A wife, she had no child; the
      mother in her was spent upon her husband, whose devotion, honour, name,
      and goodness were dear to her. Yet&mdash;yet she had a world of her own;
      and reading Napoleon's impassioned letters to his wife, written with how
      great homage! in the flow of the tide washing to famous battle-fields, an
      exultation of ambition inspired her, and the genius of her distinguished
      ancestors set her heart beating hard. Presently, her face alive with
      feeling, a furnace in her eyes, she repeated a paragraph from Napoleon's
      letters to Josephine:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   The enemy have lost, my dearest, eighteen thousand men, prisoners,
   killed, and wounded. Wurmzer has nothing left but to throw himself
   into Mantua. I hope soon to be in your arms. I love you to
   distraction. All is well. Nothing is wanting to your husband's
   happiness, save the love of Josephine.
</pre>
    <p>
      She sprang to her feet. "And she, wife of a hero, was in common intrigue
      with Hippolyte Charles at the time! She had a conqueror, a splendid
      adventurer, and coming emperor, for a husband, and she loved him not. I&mdash;I
      could have knelt to him&mdash;worshipped him. I"&mdash;With a little
      hysterical, disdainful laugh, as of the soul at itself, she leaned upon
      the window, looking into the village below, alternately smiling and
      frowning at the thought of this adventurer down at the Louis Quinze. "Yet,
      who can tell? Disraeli was half mountebank at the start," she said.
      "Napoleon dressed infamously, too, before he was successful." But again
      she laughed, as at an absurdity.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the next few days Valmond was everywhere&mdash;kind, liberal,
      quaint, tireless, at times melancholy; "in the distant perspective of the
      stage," as Monsieur De la Riviere remarked mockingly. But a passing member
      of the legislature met and was conquered by Valmond, and carried on to
      neighbouring parishes the wondrous tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      He carried it through Ville Bambord, fifty miles away; and the story of
      how a Napoleon had come to Pontiac reached the ears of old Sergeant
      Eustache Lagroin of the Old Guard, who had fought with the Great Emperor
      at Waterloo, and in his army on twenty other battle-fields. He had been at
      Fontainebleau when Napoleon bade farewell to the Old Guard, saying: "For
      twenty years I have ever found you in the path of honour and glory. Adieu,
      my children! I would I were able to press you all to my heart&mdash;but I
      will at least press your eagle. I go to record the great deeds we have
      done together."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the gossip came to Lagroin, as he sat in his doorway, babbling of
      Grouchy and Lannes and Davoust, the Little Corporal outflanking them all
      in his praise, his dim blue eyes flared out from the distant sky of youth
      and memory, his lips pursed in anger, and he got to his feet, his stick
      fiercely pounding the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tut! tut!" said he. "A lie! a pretty lie! I knew all the Napoleons&mdash;Joseph,
      Lucien, Louis, Jerome, Caroline, Eliza, Pauline&mdash;all! I have seen
      them every one. And their children&mdash;pah! Who can deceive me? I will
      go to Pontiac, I will see to this tomfoolery. I'll bring the rascal to the
      drumhead. Does he think there is no one? Pish! I will spit him at the
      first stroke. Here, here, Manette," he cried to his grand-daughter; "fetch
      out my uniform, give it an airing, and see to the buttons. I will show
      this brag how one of the Old Guard looked at Saint Jean. Quick, Manette,
      my sabre polish; I'll clean my musket, and to-morrow I will go to Pontiac.
      I'll put the scamp through his facings&mdash;but yes! I am eighty, but I
      have an arm of thirty." True to his word, the next morning at daybreak he
      started to walk to Pontiac, accompanied for a mile or so by Manette and a
      few of the villagers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See you, my child," he said, "I will stay with my niece, Desire Malboir,
      and her daughter Elise, there in Pontiac. You shall hear how I fetch that
      vagabond to his potage!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond had purchased a tolerable white horse through Medallion. After a
      day's grooming the beast showed off very well; and he was now seen riding
      about the parish, dressed after the manner of the First Napoleon, with a
      cocked hat and a short sword at his side. He rode well, and the silver and
      pennies he scattered were most fruitful of effect from the martial
      elevation. He happened to be riding into the village at one end as
      Sergeant Lagroin entered it at the other, each going towards the Louis
      Quinze. Valmond knew nothing of Sergeant Lagroin, so that what followed
      was of the inspiration of the moment. It sprang from his wit, and from his
      knowledge of Napoleon and the Napoleonic history, a knowledge which had
      sent Monsieur Garon into tears of joy in his own home, and afterwards off
      to the Manor House and also to the Seigneury, full of praise of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catching sight of the sergeant, the significance of the thing flashed to
      his brain, and his course was mapped out on the instant. Sitting very
      straight, Valmond rode steadily down towards the old soldier. The sergeant
      had drawn notice as he came up the street, and people came to their doors,
      and children followed the grey, dust-covered veteran, in his last-century
      uniform. He came as far as the Louis Quinze, and then, looking on up the
      road, he saw the white horse, the cocked hat, the white waistcoat, and the
      long grey coat. He brought his stick down smartly on the ground, drew
      himself up, squared his shoulders, and said: "Courage, Eustache Lagroin.
      It is not forty Prussians, but one rogue! Crush him! Down with the
      pretender!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So, with a defiant light in his eye, he came on, the old uniform sagging
      loosely on the shrunken body, which yet was soldier-like from head to
      foot. Years of camp and discipline and battle and endurance were in the
      whole bearing of the man. He was no more of Pontiac and this simple life
      than was Valmond himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they neared each other, the challenger and the challenged, the champion
      and the invader, and quickly the village emptied itself out to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Valmond came so close that he could observe every detail of the old
      man's uniform, he suddenly reined in his horse, drew him back on his
      haunches with his left hand, and with his right saluted&mdash;not the old
      sergeant, but the coat of the Old Guard, to which his eyes were directed.
      Mechanically the hand of the sergeant went to his cap, then, starting
      forward with an angry movement, he seemed as though he would attack
      Valmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond sat very still, his right hand thrust in his bosom, his forehead
      bent, his eyes calmly, resolutely, yet distantly, looking at the sergeant,
      who grew suddenly still also, while the people watched and wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Valmond looked, a soft light passed across his face, relieving its
      theatrical firmness, the half-contemptuous curl of his lip. He knew well
      enough that this event would make or unmake him in Pontiac. He became also
      aware that a carriage had driven up among the villagers, and had stopped;
      and though he did not look directly, he felt that it was Madame Chalice.
      This soft look on his face was not all assumed; for the ancient uniform of
      the sergeant touched something in him, the true comedian, or the true
      Napoleon, and it seemed as if he might dismount and take the old soldier
      in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      He set his horse on a little, and paused again, with not more than fifteen
      feet between them. The sergeant's brain was going round like a top. It was
      not he that challenged after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Soldier of the Old Guard," cried Valmond, in a clear, ringing voice, "how
      far is it to Friedland?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a machine the veteran's hand again went up to his cap, and he
      answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Friedland&mdash;the width of a ditch!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice shook as he said it, and the world to him was all a muddle then;
      for Napoleon the Great had asked a private this question after that battle
      on the Alle, when Berningsen, the Russian, threw away an army to the
      master strategist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The private had answered the question in the words of Sergeant Lagroin. It
      was a saying long afterwards among the Old Guard, though it may not be
      found in the usual histories of that time, where every battalion, almost
      every company, had a watchword, which passed to make room for others, as
      victory followed victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Soldier of the Old Guard," said Valmond again, "how came you by those
      scars upon your forehead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was a drummer at Auerstadt, a corporal at Austerlitz, a sergeant at
      Waterloo," rolled back the reply, in a high, quavering voice, as memories
      of great events blew in upon the ancient fires of his spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" answered Valmond, nodding eagerly; "with Davoust at Auerstadt&mdash;thirty
      against sixty thousand men. At eight o'clock, all fog and mist, as you
      marched up the defile towards the Sonnenberg hills, the brave Gudin and
      his division feeling their way to Blucher. Comrade, how still you stepped,
      your bayonet thrust out before you, clearing the mists, your eyes
      straining, your teeth set, ready to thrust. All at once a quick-moving
      mass sprang out of the haze, and upon you, with hardly a sound of warning;
      and an army of hussars launched themselves at your bayonets! You bent that
      wall back like a piece of steel, and broke it. Comrade, that was the
      beginning, in the mist of morning. Tell me how you fared in the light of
      evening, at the end of that bloody day."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old soldier was trembling. There was no sign, no movement, from the
      crowd. Across the fields came the sharpening of a scythe, the cry of the
      grasshoppers, and the sound of a mill-wheel arose near by. In the mill
      itself, far up in a deep dormer window, sat Parpon with his black cat,
      looking down upon the scene with a grim smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sergeant saw that mist fronting Sonnenberg rise up, and show ten
      thousand splendid cavalry and fifty thousand infantry, with a king and a
      prince to lead them down upon those malleable but unmoving squares of
      French infantry. He saw himself drumming the Prussians back and his
      Frenchmen on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beautiful God!" he cried proudly, "that was a day! And every man of the
      Third Corps that time lift up the lid of hell and drop a Prussian in. I
      stand beside Davoust once, and ping! come a bullet, and take off his
      chapeau. It fell upon my drum. I stoop and pick it up and hand it to him,
      but I keep drumming with one hand all the time. 'Comrade,' say I, 'the
      army thanks you for your courtesy.' 'Brother,' he say, 'twas to your
      drum,' and his eye flash out where Gudin carved his way through those pigs
      of Prussians. 'I'd take my head off to keep your saddle filled, comrade,'
      say I. Ping! come a bullet and catch me in the calf. 'You hold your head
      too high, brother,' the general say, and he smile. 'I'll hold it higher,'
      answer I, and I snatch at a soldier. 'Up with me on your shoulder, big
      comrade,' I say, and he lift me up. I make my sticks sing on the leather.
      'You shall take off your hat to the Little Corporal to-morrow, if you've
      still your head, brother'&mdash;speak Davoust like that, and then he ride
      away like the devil to Morand's guns. Ha, ha, ha!" The sergeant's face was
      blazing with a white glare, for he was very pale, and seemed unconscious
      of all save the scene in his mind's eye. "Ha, ha, ha!" he laughed again.
      "Beautiful God, how did Davoust bring us on up to Sonnenberg! And next day
      I saw the Little Corporal. 'Drummer,' say he, 'no head's too high for my
      Guard. Come you, comrade, your general gives you to me. Come, Corporal
      Lagroin,' he call; and I come. 'But, first,' he say, 'up on the shoulder
      of your big soldier again, and play.' 'What shall I play, sire?' I ask.
      'Play ten thousand heroes to Walhalla,' he answer. I play, and I think of
      my brother Jacques, who went fighting to heaven the day before. Beautiful
      God! that was a day at Auerstadt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Soldier," said Valmond, waving his hand, "step on. There is a drum at
      Louis Quinze. Let us go together, comrade."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old sergeant was in a dream. He wheeled, the crowd made way for him,
      and at the neck of the white horse he came on with Valmond. As they passed
      the carriage of Madame Chalice, Valmond made no sign. They stopped in
      front of the hotel, and Valmond, motioning to the garcon, gave him an
      order. The old sergeant stood silent, his eyes full fixed upon Valmond. In
      a moment the boy came out with the drum. Valmond took it, and, holding it
      in his hands, said softly: "Soldier of the Old Guard, here is a drum of
      France." Without a word the old man took the drum, his fingers trembling
      as he fastened it to his belt. When the sticks were in his hand, all
      trembling ceased, and his hands became steady. He was living in the past
      entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Soldier," said Valmond in a loud voice, "remember Austerlitz. The Heights
      of Pratzen are before you. Play up the feet of the army."
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant the old man did not move, and then a sullen sort of look
      came over his face. He was not a drummer at Austerlitz, and for the
      instant he did not remember the tune the drummers played.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Soldier," said Valmond softly, "with 'the Little Sword that Danced' play
      up the feet of the army."
    </p>
    <p>
      A light broke over the old man's face. The swift look he cast on Valmond
      had no distrust now. Instantly his hand went to his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My General!" he said, and stepped in front of the white horse. There was
      a moment's pause, and then the sergeant's arms were raised, and down came
      the sticks with a rolling rattle on the leather. They sent a shiver of
      feeling through the village, and turned the meek white horse into a
      charger of war. No man laughed at the drama performed in Pontiac that day,
      not even the little coterie who were present, not even Monsieur De la
      Riviere, whose brow was black with hatred, for he had watched 'the eyes of
      Madame Chalice fill with tears at the old sergeant's tale of Auerstadt,
      had noticed her admiring glance, "at this damned comedian," as he now
      called Valmond. When he came to her carriage, she said, with oblique
      suggestion:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impostor! fakir!" was his sulky reply. "Nothing more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If fakirs and impostors are so convincing, dear monsieur, why be yourself
      longer? Listen!" she added. Valmond had spoken down at the aged drummer,
      whose arms were young again, as once more he marched on Pratzen. Suddenly
      from the sergeant's lips there broke, in a high, shaking voice, to the
      rattle of the drum:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "Conscrits, au pas;
          Ne pleurez pas;
          Ne pleurez pas;
          Marchez au pas,
          Au pas, au pas, au pas, au pas!"
</pre>
    <p>
      They had not gone twenty yards before fifty men and boys, caught in the
      inflammable moment, sprang out from the crowd, fell involuntarily into
      rough marching order, and joined in the inspiring refrain:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "Marchez au pas,
          Au pas, au pas, au pas, au pas!"
</pre>
    <p>
      The old man in front was charged anew. All at once, at a word from
      Valmond, he broke into the Marseillaise, with his voice and with his drum.
      To these Frenchmen of an age before the Revolution, the Marseillaise had
      only been a song. Now in their ignorant breasts there waked the spirit of
      France, and from their throats there burst out, with a half-delirious
      ecstasy:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "Allons, enfants de la patrie,
          Le jour de gloire est arrive."
</pre>
    <p>
      As they neared the Louis Quinze, a dozen men, just arrived in the village,
      returned from river-driving, carried away by the chant, tumultuously
      joined in the procession, and so came on in a fever of vague patriotism. A
      false note in the proceedings, a mismove on the part of Valmond, would
      easily have made the thing ridiculous; but even to Madame Chalice, with
      her keen artistic sense, it had a pathetic sort of dignity, by virtue of
      its rude earnestness, its raw sincerity. She involuntarily thought of the
      great Napoleon and his toy kingdom of Elba, of Garibaldi and his handful
      of patriots. There were depths here, and she knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even the pantaloon may have a soul," she said; "or a king may have a
      heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of the Louis Quinze, Valmond waved his hand for a halt, and the
      ancient drummer wheeled and faced him, fronting the crowd. Valmond was
      pale, and his eyes burned like restless ghosts. Surely the Cupid bow of
      the thin Napoleonic lips was there, the distant yet piercing look. He
      waved his hand again, and the crowd were silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My children," said he, "we have begun well. Once more among you the
      antique spirit lives. From you may come the quickening of our beloved
      country; for she is yours, though here under the flag of our ancient and
      amiable enemy you wait the hour of your return to her. In you there is
      nothing mean or dull; you are true Frenchmen. My love is with you. And you
      and I, true to each other, may come into our own again&mdash;over there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to the East.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Through you and me may France be born again; and in the villages and
      fields and houses of Normandy and Brittany you may, as did your ancestors,
      live in peace, and bring your bones to rest in that blessed and honourable
      ground. My children, my heart is full. Let us move on together. Napoleon
      from St. Helena calls to you, Napoleon in Pontiac calls to you! Will you
      come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Reckless cheering followed; many were carried away into foolish tears, and
      Valmond sat still and let them kiss his hand, while pitchers of wine went
      round.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is our fakir now, dear monsieur?" said Madame Chalice to De la
      Riviere once again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond got silence with a gesture. He opened his waistcoat, took from his
      bosom an order fastened to a little bar of gold, and held it in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drummer," he said, in a clear, full tone, "call the army to attention."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man set their blood tingling with the impish sticks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I advance Sergeant Lagroin, of the Old Guard of glorious memory, to the
      rank of Captain in my Household Troops, and I command you to obey him as
      such."
    </p>
    <p>
      His look bent upon the crowd, as Napoleon's might have done on the Third
      Corps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drummer, call the army to attention," fell the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      And again like a small whirlwind of hailstones the sticks shook on the
      drum.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I advance Captain Lagroin to the rank of Colonel in my Household Troops,
      and I command you to obey him as such."
    </p>
    <p>
      And once more: "Drummer, call the army to attention."
    </p>
    <p>
      The sticks swung down, but somehow they faltered, for the drummer was
      shaking now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I advance Colonel Lagroin to the rank of General in my Household Troops,
      and I command you to obey him as such."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he beckoned, and the old man drew near. Stooping, he pinned the order
      upon his breast. When the sergeant saw what it was, he turned pale,
      trembled, and the drumsticks fell from his hand. His eyes shone like sun
      on wet glass, then tears sprang from them upon his face. He caught
      Valmond's hand and kissed it, and cried, oblivious of them all:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, sire, sire! It is true. It is true. I know that ribbon, and I know
      you are a Napoleon. Sire, I love you, and I will die for you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time that day a touch of the fantastic came into Valmond's
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "General," he said, "the centuries look down on us as they looked down on
      him, your sire&mdash;and mine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He doffed his hat, and the hats of all likewise came off in a strange
      quiet. A cheer followed, and Valmond motioned for wine to go round freely.
      Then he got off his horse, and, taking the weeping old man by the arm,
      himself loosening the drum from his belt, they passed into the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A cheerful bit of foolery and treason," said Monsieur De la Riviere to
      Madame Chalice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Seigneur, if you only had more humour and less patriotism!" she
      answered. "Treason may have its virtues. It certainly is interesting,
      which, in your present gloomy state, you are not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder, madame, that you can countenance this imposture," he broke out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent and superior monsieur, I wonder sometimes that I can
      countenance you. Breakfast with me on Sunday, and perhaps I will tell you
      why&mdash;at twelve o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      She drove on, but, meeting the Cure, stopped her carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so grave, my dear Cure?" she asked, holding out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fingered the gold cross upon his breast&mdash;she had given it to him
      two years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to counsel him&mdash;Monsieur Valmond," he said. Then, with a
      sigh: "He sent me two hundred dollars for the altar to-day, and fifty
      dollars to buy new cassocks for myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in the morning and tell me what he says," she answered; "and bring
      our dear avocat."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she looked from her window an hour later, she saw bonfires burning, and
      up from the village came the old song, that had prefaced a drama in
      Pontiac.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Elise Malboir had a keener interest that night, for Valmond and Parpon
      brought her uncle "General Lagroin," in honour to her mother's cottage;
      and she sat and listened dreamily, as Valmond and the old man talked of
      great things to be done.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Prince or plebeian, Valmond played his part with equal aplomb at the
      simple home of Elise Malboir and at the Manoir Hilaire, where Madame
      Chalice received him. His dress had nothing of the bizarre on this
      occasion. He was in black-long coat, silk stockings, the collar of his
      waistcoat faced with white, his neckerchief white and full, his enamelled
      shoes adorned with silver buckles. His present repose and decorum
      contrasted strangely with the fanciful display at his first introduction.
      Madame Chalice approved instantly, for though the costume was, in itself,
      an affectation, previous to the time by a generation, it was in the
      picture, was sedately refined. She welcomed him in the salon where many
      another distinguished man had been entertained&mdash;from Frontenac, and
      Vaudreuil, down to Sir Guy Carleton. The Manor had belonged to her
      husband's people seventy-five years before, and though, as a banker in New
      York, Monsieur Chalice had become an American of the Americans, at her
      request he had bought back from a kinsman the old place, unchanged,
      furniture and all. Bringing the antique plate, china, and bric-a-brac,
      made in France when Henri Quatre was king, she fared away to Quebec, set
      the rude mansion in order, and was happy for a whole summer, as was her
      husband, the best of fishermen and sportsmen. The Manor House stood on a
      knoll, behind which, steppe on steppe, climbed the hills, till they ended
      in Dalgrothe Mountain. Beyond the mountain were unexplored regions, hill
      and valley floating into hill and valley, lost in a miasmic haze, ruddy,
      silent, untenanted, save, mayhap, by the strange people known as the
      Little Good Folk of the Scarlet Hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house had been built in the seventeenth century, and the walls were
      very thick, to keep out both cold and attack. Beneath the high-pointed
      roof were big dormer windows, and huge chimneys flanked each side of the
      house. The great roof gave a sense of crouching or hovering, for warmth or
      in menace. As Valmond entered the garden, Madame Chalice was leaning over
      the lower half of the entrance door, which opened latitudinally, and was
      hung on large iron hinges of quaint design, made by some
      seventeenth-century forgeron. Behind her deepened hospitably the spacious
      hall, studded and heavy beamed, with its unpainted pine ceiling toned to a
      good brown by smoke and time. Caribou and moose antlers hung along the
      wall, with arquebuses, powder-horns, big shot-bags, swords, and even
      pieces of armour, such as Cartier brought with him from St. Malo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Chalice looked out of this ancient avenue, a contrast, yet a
      harmony; for, though her dress was modern, her person had a rare touch of
      the archaic, and fitted into the picture like a piece of beautiful
      porcelain, coloured long before the art of making fadeless colours was
      lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an amused, meditative smiling at her lips, a kind of wonder, the
      tender flush of a new experience. She turned, and, stepping softly into
      the salon, seated herself near the immense chimney, in a heavily carved
      chair, her feet lost in rich furs on the polished floor. A quaint table at
      her hand was dotted with rare old books and miniatures, and behind her
      ticked an ancient clock in a tall mahogany case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond came forward, hat in hand, and raised to his lips the fingers she
      gave him. He did it with the vagueness of one in a dream, she thought, and
      she neither understood nor relished his uncomplimentary abstraction; so
      she straightway determined to give him some troublesome moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have waited to drink my coffee with you," she said, motioning him to a
      seat; "and you may smoke a cigarette, if you wish."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes wandered over his costume with critical satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hand slightly, declining the permission, and looked at her
      with an intent seriousness, which took no account of the immediate charm
      of her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like to ask you a question," he said, without preamble. She was
      amused, interested. Here was an unusual man, who ignored the conventional
      preliminary nothings, beating down the grass before the play, as it were.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was never good at catechism," she answered. "But I will be as
      hospitable as I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've felt," he said, "that you can&mdash;can see through things; that you
      can balance them, that you get at all sides, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been reading Napoleon's letters this very afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Full squared?" she interrupted quizzically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As the Great Emperor said," he answered. "A woman sees farther than a
      man, and if she has judgment as well, she is the best prophet in the
      world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It sounds distinctly like a compliment," she answered. "You are trying to
      break that square!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was mystified; he was different from any man she had ever entertained.
      She was not half sure she liked it. Yet, if he were in very truth a prince&mdash;she
      thought of his debut in flowered waistcoat, panama hat, and enamelled
      boots!&mdash;she should take this confidence as a compliment; if he were a
      barber, she could not resent it; she could not waste wit or time; she
      could not even, in extremity, call the servant to show the barber out; and
      in any case she was too comfortably interested to worry herself with
      speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very much in earnest. "I want to ask you," he said, "what is the
      thing most needed to make a great idea succeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never had a great idea," she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her eagerly, with youthful, questioning eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How simple, and yet how astute he is!" she thought, remembering the event
      of yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you had&mdash;I was sure you had," he said in a troubled sort
      of way. He did not see that she was eluding him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean, I never had a fixed and definite idea that I proceeded to apply,
      as you have done," she explained tentatively. "But&mdash;well, I suppose
      that the first requisite for success is absolute belief in the idea; that
      it be part of one's life; to suffer for, to fight for, to die for, if need
      be&mdash;though that sounds like a handbook of moral mottoes, doesn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it, that's it," he said. "The thing must be in your bones&mdash;hein?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Also in&mdash;your blood&mdash;hein?" she rejoined slowly and meaningly,
      looking over the top of her coffee-cup at him. Somehow again the plebeian
      quality in that hein grated on her, and she could not resist the retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" said he confusedly, plunging into another pitfall. She had
      challenged him, and he knew it. "Nothing what-ever," she answered, with an
      urbanity that defied the suggestion of malice. Yet, now that she
      remembered, she had sweetly challenged one of a royal house for the like
      lapse into the vulgar tongue. A man should not be beheaded because of a
      what. So she continued more seriously: "The idea must be himself, all of
      him, born with him, the rightful output of his own nature, the thing he
      must inevitably do, or waste his life."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked him honestly in the eyes. She had spoken with the soft irony of
      truth, the blind tyranny of the just. She had meant to test him here and
      there by throwing little darts of satire, and yet he made her serious and
      candid in spite of herself. He was of kin to her in some part of his
      nature. He did not concern her as a man of personal or social
      possibilities&mdash;merely as an active originality. Leaning back
      languidly, she was eyeing him closely from under drooping lids, smiling,
      too, in an unimportant sort of way, as if what she had said was a trifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consummate liar and comedian, or true man and no pretender, his eyes did
      not falter. They were absorbed, as if in eager study of a theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, that's it; and if he has it, what next?" said he meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, opportunity, joined to coolness, knowledge of men, power of
      combination, strategy, and"&mdash;she paused, and a purely feminine
      curiosity impelled her to add suggestively&mdash;"and a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. "And a woman," he repeated after her musingly, and not turning
      it to account cavalierly, as he might have done. He was taking himself
      with a simple seriousness that appealed to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may put strategy out of the definition, leaving in the woman," she
      continued ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt the point, and her demure dart struck home. But he saw what an
      ally she might make. Tremendous possibilities moved before him. His heart
      beat faster than it did yesterday when the old sergeant faced him. Here
      was beauty&mdash;he admired that; power&mdash;he wished for that. What
      might he not accomplish, no matter how wild his move, with this wonderful
      creature as his friend, his ally, his&mdash;&mdash;He paused, for this
      house had a master as well as a mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will leave in the woman," he said quietly, yet with a sort of trouble
      in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In your idea?" was the negligent question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is the woman?" insinuated the soft, bewildering voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here!" he answered emotionally, and he believed it was the truth. She
      stood looking meditatively out of the window, not at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Pontiac?" she asked presently, turning with a child-like surprise.
      "Ah, yes, yes! I know&mdash;one of the people; suitable for Pontiac; but
      is it wise? She is pretty&mdash;but is it wise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was adroitly suggesting Elise Malboir, whose little romance she had
      discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is the prettiest and wisest lady I ever knew, or ever hoped to know,"
      he said earnestly, laying his hand upon his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How far will your idea take you?" she asked evasively, her small fingers
      tightening a gold hair-pin. "To Paris&mdash;to the Tuileries!" he
      answered, rising to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you start&mdash;from Pontiac?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What difference, Pontiac or Cannes, like the Great Master after Elba," he
      said. "The principle is the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will come," he answered. "I have friends&mdash;and hopes."
    </p>
    <p>
      She almost laughed. She was suddenly struck by the grotesqueness of the
      situation. But she saw how she had hurt him, and she said instantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, with those one may go far. Sit down and tell me all your
      plans."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to comply, when, glancing out of the window, she saw the old
      sergeant, now "General Lagroin," and Parpon hastening up the walk. Parpon
      ambled comfortably beside the old man, who seemed ten years younger than
      he had done the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your army and cabinet, monseigneur!" she said with a pretty, mocking
      gesture of salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her reprovingly. "My General and my Minister; as brave a
      soldier and as able a counsellor as ever prince had. Madame," he added,
      "they only are farceurs who do not dare, and have not wisdom. My General
      has scars from Auerstadt, Austerlitz, and Waterloo; my Minister is feared&mdash;in
      Pontiac. Was he not the trusted friend of the Grand Seigneur, as he was
      called here, the father of your Monseiur De la Riviere? Has he yet erred
      in advising me? Have we yet failed? Madame," he added, a little
      rhetorically, "as we have begun, so will we end, true to our principles,
      and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And gentlemen of the king," she said provokingly, urging him on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon, gentlemen of the Empire, madame, as time and our lives will
      prove.... Madame, I thank you for your violets of Sunday last."
    </p>
    <p>
      She admired the acumen that had seized the perfect opportunity to thank
      her for the violets, the badge of the Great Emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My hives shall not be empty of bees&mdash;or honey," she said, alluding
      to the imperial bees, and she touched his arm in a pretty, gracious
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame&mdash;ah, madame!" he replied, and his eyes grew moist.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bade the servant admit Lagroin and Parpon. They bowed profoundly,
      first to Valmond, and afterwards to Madame Chalice. She saw the point, and
      it amused her. She read in the old man's eye the soldier's contempt for
      women, together with his new-born reverence and love for Valmond. Lagroin
      was still dressed in the uniform of the Old Guard, and wore on his breast
      the sacred ribbon which Valmond had given him the day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, General?" said Valmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire," said the old man, "they mock us in the streets. Come to the
      window, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      The "sire," fell on the ears of Madame Chalice like a mot in a play; but
      Valmond, living up to his part, was grave and solicitous. He walked to the
      window, and the old man said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, do you not hear a drum?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint rat-tat came up the road. Valmond bowed. "Sire," the old man
      continued, "I would not act till I had your orders."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whence comes the mockery?" Valmond asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other shook his head. "Sire, I do not know. But I remember of such a
      thing happening to the Emperor. It was in the garden of the Tuileries, and
      twenty-four battalions of the Old Guard filed past our great chief. Some
      fool sent out a gamin dressed in regimentals in front of one of the bands,
      and then&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough, General," said Valmond; "I understand. I will go down into the
      village&mdash;eh, monsieur?" he added, turning to Parpon with impressive
      consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, there is one behind these mockers," answered the little man in a
      low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond turned towards Madame Chalice. "I know my enemy, madame," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your enemy is not here," she rejoined kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped over her hand, and bowed Lagroin and Parpon to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame," he said, "I thank you. Will you accept a souvenir of him whom we
      both love, martyr and friend of France?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew from his breast a small painting of Napoleon, on ivory, and handed
      it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was the work of David," he continued. "You will find it well
      authenticated. Look upon the back of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked, and her heart beat a little faster. "This was done when he was
      alive?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the King of Rome," he answered. "Adieu, madame. Again I thank you,
      for our cause as for myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned away. She let him get as far as the door. "Wait, wait!" she said
      suddenly, a warm light in her face, for her imagination had been touched.
      "Tell me, tell me the truth. Who are you? Are you really a Napoleon? I can
      be a constant ally, but, I charge you, speak the truth to me. Are you&mdash;"
      She stopped abruptly. "No, no; do not tell me," she added quickly. "If you
      are not, you will be your own executioner. I will ask for no further proof
      than did Sergeant Lagroin. It is in a small way yet, but you are playing a
      terrible game. Do you realise what may happen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the hour that you ask a last proof I will give it," he said almost
      fiercely. "I go now to meet an enemy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I should change that enemy into a friend&mdash;" she hinted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I should have no need of stratagem or force."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Force?" she asked suggestively. The drollery of it set her smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a week I shall have five hundred men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dreamer!" she thought, and shook her head dubiously; but, glancing again
      at the ivory portrait, her mood changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Au revoir," she said. "Come and tell me about the mockers. Success go
      with you&mdash;sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she did not know whether she thought him sire or sinner, gentleman or
      comedian, as she watched him go down the hill with Lagroin and Parpon. But
      she had the portrait. How did he get it? No matter, it was hers now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curious to know more of the episode in the village below, she ordered her
      carriage, and came driving slowly past the Louis Quinze at an exciting
      moment. A crowd had gathered, and boys, and even women, were laughing and
      singing in ridicule snatches of, "Vive Napoleon!" For, in derision of
      yesterday's event, a small boy, tricked out with a paper cocked-hat and
      incongruous regimentals, with a hobby-horse between his legs, was marching
      up and down, preceded by another lad, who played a toy drum in derision of
      Lagroin. The children had been well rehearsed, for even as Valmond arrived
      upon the scene, Lagroin and Parpon on either side of him, the mock Valmond
      was bidding the drummer: "Play up the feet of the army!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd parted on either side, silenced and awed by the look of
      potential purpose in the face of this yesterday's hero. The old sergeant's
      glance was full of fury, Parpon's of a devilish sort of glee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond approached the lads.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My children," he said kindly, "you have not learned your lesson well
      enough. You shall be taught." He took the paper caps from their heads. "I
      will give you better caps than these." He took the hobby-horse, the drum,
      and the tin swords. "I will give you better things than these." He put the
      caps on the ground, added the toys to the heap, and Parpon, stooping,
      lighted the paper. Scattering money among the crowd, and giving some
      silver to the lads, Valmond stood looking at the bonfire for a moment, and
      then, pointing to it dramatically, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friends, my brothers, Frenchmen, we will light larger fires than
      these. Your young Seigneur sought to do me honour this afternoon. I thank
      him, and he shall have proof of my affection in due time. And now our good
      landlord's wine is free to you, for one goblet each. My children," he
      added, turning to the little mockers, "come to me to-morrow and I will
      show you how to be soldiers. My General shall teach you what to do, and I
      will teach you what to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost instantly there arose the old admiring cries of, "Vive Napoleon!"
      and he knew that he had regained his ground. Amid the pleasant tumult the
      three entered the hotel together, like people in a play.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were going up the stairs, Parpon whispered to the old soldier, who
      laid his hand fiercely upon the fine sword at his side, given him that
      morning by Valmond; for, looking down, Lagroin saw the young Seigneur
      maliciously laughing at them, as if in delight at the mischief he had
      caused.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, at nine o'clock, the old sergeant went to the Seigneury,
      knocked, and was admitted to a room where were seated the young Seigneur,
      Medallion, and the avocat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, General," said De la Riviere, rising with great formality, "what
      may I do to serve you? Will you join our party?" He motioned to a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man's lips were set and stern, and he vouchsafed no reply to the
      hospitable request.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur," he said, "to-day you threw dirt at my great master. He is of
      royal blood, and he may not fight you. But I, monsieur, his General,
      demand satisfaction&mdash;swords or pistols!"
    </p>
    <p>
      De la Riviere sat down, leaned back in his chair, and laughed. Without a
      word the old man stepped forward, and struck him across the mouth with his
      red cotton handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then take that, monsieur," said he, "from one who fought for the First
      Napoleon, and will fight for this Napoleon against the tongue of slander
      and the acts of fools. I killed two Prussians once for saying that the
      Great Emperor's shirt stuck out below his waistcoat. You'll find me at the
      Louis Quinze," he added, before De la Riviere, choking with wrath, could
      do more than get to his feet; and, wheeling, he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Seigneur would have followed him, but the avocat laid a
      restraining hand upon his arm, and Medallion said: "Dear Seigneur, see,
      you can't fight him. The parish would only laugh."
    </p>
    <p>
      De la Riviere took the advice, and on Sunday, over the coffee, unburdened
      the tale to Madame Chalice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrary to his expectations, she laughed a great deal, then soothed his
      wounded feelings and advised him as Medallion had done. And because
      Valmond commanded the old sergeant to silence, the matter ended for the
      moment. But it would have its hour yet, and Valmond knew this as well as
      did the young Seigneur.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was no jest of Valmond's that he would, or could, have five hundred
      followers in two weeks. Lagroin and Parpon were busy, each in his own way&mdash;Lagroin,
      open, bluff, imperative; Parpon, silent, acute, shrewd. Two days before
      the feast of St. John the Baptist, the two made a special tour through the
      parish for certain recruits. If these could be enlisted, a great many men
      of this and other parishes would follow. They were, by name, Muroc the
      charcoalman, Duclosse the mealman, Lajeunesse the blacksmith, and Garotte
      the limeburner, all men of note, after their kind, with influence and
      individuality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lagroin chafed that he must play recruiting-sergeant and general also. But
      it gave him comfort to remember that the Great Emperor had not at times
      disdained to be his own recruiting-sergeant; that, after Friedland, he
      himself had been taken into the Old Guard by the Emperor; that Davoust had
      called him brother; that Ney had shared his supper and slept with him
      under the same blanket. Parpon would gladly have done this work alone, but
      he knew that Lagroin in his regimentals would be useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sought-for comrades were often to be found together about the noon
      hour in the shop of Jose Lajeunesse. They formed the coterie of the
      humble, even as the Cure's coterie represented the aristocracy of Pontiac&mdash;with
      Medallion as a connecting link.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arches and poles were being put up, to be decorated against the feast-day,
      and piles of wood for bonfires were arranged at points on the hills round
      the village. Cheer and goodwill were everywhere, for a fine harvest was in
      view, and this feast-day always brought gladness and simple revelling.
      Parish interchanged with parish; but, because it was so remote, Pontiac
      was its own goal of pleasure, and few fared forth, though others came from
      Ville Bambord and elsewhere to join the fete. As Lagroin and the dwarf
      came to the door of the smithy, they heard the loud laugh of Lajeunesse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good!" said Parpon. "Hear how he tears his throat!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he has sense, I'll make a captain of him," remarked Lagroin
      consequentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall beat him into a captain on his own anvil," rejoined the little
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the shop. Lajeunesse was leaning on his bellows, laughing,
      and holding an iron in the spitting fire; Muroc was seated on the edge of
      the cooling tub; and Duclosse was resting on a bag of his excellent meal.
      Garotte was the only missing member of the quartette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muroc was a wag, a grim sort of fellow, black from his trade, with big
      rollicking eyes. At times he was not easy to please, but if he took a
      liking, he was for joking at once. He approved of Parpon, and never lost a
      chance of sharpening his humour on the dwarf's impish whetstone of a
      tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord! Lord!" he cried, with feigned awe, getting to his feet at sight of
      the two. Then, to his comrades, "Children, children, off with your hats!
      Here is Monsieur Talleyrand, if I'm not mistaken. On to your feet,
      mealman, and dust your stomach. Lajeunesse, wipe your face with your
      leather. Duck your heads, stupids!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With mock solemnity the three greeted Parpon and Lagroin. The old
      sergeant's face flushed, and his hand dropped to his sword; but he had
      promised Parpon to say nothing till he got his cue, and he would keep his
      word. So he disposed himself in an attitude of martial attention. The
      dwarf bowed to the others with a face of as great gravity as the
      charcoalman's, and waving his hand, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep your seats, my children, and God be with you. You are right,
      smutty-face; I am Monsieur Talleyrand, Minister of the Crown."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The devil, you say!" cried the mealman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tut, tut!" said Lajeunesse, chaffing; "haven't you heard the news? The
      devil is dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The dwarf's hand went into his pocket. "My poor orphan," said he, trotting
      over and thrusting some silver into the blacksmith's pocket, "I see he
      hasn't left you well off. Accept my humble gift."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The devil dead?" cried Muroc; "then I'll go marry his daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Parpon climbed up on a pile of untired wheels, and with an elfish grin
      began singing. Instantly the three humorists became silent and listened,
      the blacksmith pumping his bellows mechanically the while.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       "O mealman white, give me your daughter,
        Oh, give her to me, your sweet Suzon!
        O mealman dear, you can do no better
        For I have a chateau at Malmaison.

        Black charcoalman, you shall not have her
        She shall not marry you, my Suzon&mdash;
        A bag of meal&mdash;and a sack of carbon!
        Non, non, non, non, non, non, non, non!

        Go look at your face, my fanfaron,
        For my daughter and you would be night and day,
        Non, non, non, non, non, non, non, non,
        Not for your chateau at Malmaison,
        Non, non, non, non, non, non, non, non,
        You shall not marry her, my Suzon."
</pre>
    <p>
      A better weapon than his waspish tongue was Parpon's voice, for it, before
      all, was persuasive. A few years before, none of them had ever heard him
      sing. An accident discovered it to them, and afterwards he sang for them
      but little, and never when it was expected of him. He might be the
      minister of a dauphin or a fool, but he was now only the mysterious Parpon
      who thrilled them. All the soul cramped in the small body was showing in
      his eyes, as on that day when he had sung before the Louis Quinze.
    </p>
    <p>
      A face suddenly appeared at a little door just opposite him. No one but
      Parpon saw it. It belonged to Madelinette, the daughter of Lajeunesse, who
      had a voice of merit. More than once the dwarf had stopped to hear her
      singing as he passed the smithy. She sang only the old chansons and the
      songs of the voyageurs, with a far greater sweetness and richness,
      however, than any in the parish; and the Cure could detect her among all
      others at mass. She had been taught her notes, but that had only opened up
      possibilities, and fretted her till she was unhappy. What she felt she
      could not put into her singing, for the machinery, unknown and tyrannical,
      was not hers. Twice before she had heard Parpon sing&mdash;at mass when
      the miller's wife was buried, and he, forgetting the world, had poured
      forth all his beautiful voice; and on that notable night before the Louis
      Quinze. If he would but teach her those songs of his, give her that sound
      of an organ in her throat! Parpon guessed what she thought. Well, he would
      see what could be done, if the blacksmith joined Valmond's standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's as good as dear Caron, the vivandiere of the Third Corps. Blood o'
      my body, I believe it's better&mdash;almost!" said Lagroin, nodding his
      head patronisingly. "She dragged me from under the mare of a damned
      Russian that cut me down, before he got my bayonet in his liver. Caron!
      Caron! ah yes, brave Caron! my dear Caron!" said the old man, smiling
      through the alluring light that the song had made for him, as he looked
      behind the curtain of the years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parpon's pleasant ridicule was not lost on the charcoalman and the
      mealman; but neither was the singing wasted; and their faces were touched
      with admiration, while the blacksmith, with a sigh, turned to his fire and
      blew the bellows softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blacksmith," said Parpon, "you have a bird that sings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've no bird that sings like that, though she has pretty notes, my bird."
      He sighed again. "'Come, blacksmith,' said the Count Lassone, when he came
      here a-fishing, 'that's a voice for a palace,' said he. 'Take it out of
      the woods and teach it,' said he, 'and it will have all Paris following
      it.' That to me, a poor blacksmith, with only my bread and sour milk, and
      a hundred dollars a year or so, and a sup of brandy when I can get it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The charcoalman spoke up. "You'll not forget the indulgences folks give
      you more than the pay for setting the dropped shoe&mdash;true gifts of
      God, bought with good butter and eggs at the holy auction, blacksmith. I
      gave you two myself. You have your blessings, Lajeunesse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So; and no one to use the indulgences but you and Madelinette, giant,"
      said the fat mealman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, thank the Lord, we've done well that way!" said the blacksmith,
      drawing himself up&mdash;for he loved nothing better than to be called the
      giant, though he was known to many as petit enfant, in irony of his size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lagroin was now impatient. He could not see the drift of this, and he was
      about to whisper to Parpon, when the little man sent him a look,
      commanding silence, and he fretted on dumbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "See, my blacksmith," said Parpon, "your bird shall be taught to sing, and
      to Paris she shall go by and by."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such foolery!" said Duclosse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's in your noddle, Parpon?" cried the charcoalman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blacksmith looked at Parpon, his face all puzzled eagerness. But
      another face at the door grew pale with suspense. Parpon quickly turned
      towards it. "See here, Madelinette," he said, in a low voice. The girl
      stepped inside and came to her father. Lajeunesse's arm ran round her
      shoulder. There was no corner of his heart into which she had not crept.
      "Out with it, Parpon!" called the blacksmith hoarsely, for the daughter's
      voice had followed herself into those farthest corners of his rugged
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will teach her to sing first; then she shall go to Quebec, and
      afterwards to Paris, my friend," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl's eyes were dilating with a great joy. "Ah, Parpon&mdash;good
      Parpon!" she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Paris! Paris! There's gossip for you, thick as mortar," cried the
      charcoalman, and the mealman's fingers beat a tattoo on his stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parpon waved his hand. "'Look to the weevil in your meal, Duclosse; and
      you, smutty-face, leave true things to your betters. See, blacksmith," he
      added, "she shall go to Quebec, and after that to Paris."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he got off the wheels, and stepped out into the centre of the shop.
      "Our master will do that for you. I swear for him, and who can say that
      Parpon was ever a liar?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The blacksmith's hand tightened on his daughter's shoulder. He was
      trembling with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it true? is it true?" he asked, and the sweat stood out on his
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He sends this for Madelinette," answered the dwarf, handing over a little
      bag of gold to the girl, who drew back. But Parpon went close to her, and
      gently forced it into her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open it," he said. She did so, and the blacksmith's eyes gloated on the
      gold. Muroc and Duclosse drew near, and peered in also. And so they stood
      there for a little while, all looking and exclaiming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Lajeunesse scratched his head. "Nobody does nothing for
      nothing," said he. "What horse do I shoe for this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "La, la!" said the charcoalman, sticking a thumb in the blacksmith's side;
      "you only give him the happy hand&mdash;like that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Duclosse was more serious. "It is the will of God that you become a
      marshal or a duke," he said wheezingly to the blacksmith. "You can't say
      no; it is the will of God, and you must bear it like a man."
    </p>
    <p>
      The child saw further; perhaps the artistic strain in her gave her keener
      reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father," she said, "Monsieur Valmond wants you for a soldier."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wants me?" he roared in astonishment. "Who's to shoe the horses a week
      days, and throw the weight o' Sundays after mass? Who's to handle a stick
      for the Cure when there's fighting among the river-men?
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there, la, la! many a time my wife, my good Florienne, said to me,
      'Jose&mdash;Jose Lajeunesse, with a chest like yours, you ought to be a
      corporal at least.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Parpon beckoned to Lagroin, and nodded. "Corporal! corporal!" cried
      Lagroin; "in a week you shall be a lieutenant and a month shall make you a
      captain, and maybe better than that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better than that&mdash;bagosh!" cried the charcoalman in surprise,
      proudly using the innocuous English oath. "Better than that&mdash;sutler,
      maybe?" said the mealman, smacking his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better than that," replied Lagroin, swelling with importance. "Ay, ay, my
      dears, great things are for you. I command the army, and I have free hand
      from my master. Ah, what joy to serve a Napoleon once again! What joy!
      Lord, how I remember&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better than that-eh?" persisted Duclosse, perspiring, the meal on his
      face making a sort of paste.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A general or a governor, my children," said Lagroin. "First in, first
      served. Best men, best pickings. But every man must love his chief, and
      serve him with blood and bayonet; and march o' nights if need, and limber
      up the guns if need, and shoe a horse if need, and draw a cork if need,
      and cook a potato if need; and be a hussar, or a tirailleur, or a
      trencher, or a general, if need. But yes, that's it; no pride but the love
      of France and the cause, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Monsieur Valmond," said the charcoalman slyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Monsieur the Emperor!" cried Lagroin almost savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught Parpon's eye, and instantly his hand went to his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, he is a comrade, that! Nothing is too good for his friends, for his
      soldiers. See!" he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took from his pocket ten gold pieces. "'These are bagatelles,' said His
      Excellency to me; 'but tell my friends, Monsieur Muroc and Monsieur
      Duclosse and Monsieur Garotte, that they are buttons for the coats of my
      sergeants, and that my captains' coats have ten times as many buttons.
      Tell them,' said he, 'that my friends shall share my fortunes; that France
      needs us; that Pontiac shall be called the nest of heroes. Tell them that
      I will come to them at nine o'clock tonight, and we will swear fidelity.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a damned good speech too&mdash;bagosh!" cried the mealman, his
      fingers hungering for the gold pieces. "We're to be captains pretty soon&mdash;eh?"
      asked Muroc.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As quick as I've taught you to handle a company," answered Lagroin, with
      importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was a patriot in '37," said Muroc. "I went against the English; I held
      abridge for two hours. I have my musket yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am a patriot now," urged Duclosse. "Why the devil not the English
      first, then go to France, and lick the Orleans!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're a skittish lot, the Orleans; they might take it in their heads to
      fight," suggested Muroc, with a little grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the devil do you expect?" roared the blacksmith, blowing the bellows
      hard in his excitement, one arm still round his daughter's shoulder.
      "D'you think we're going to play leap-frog into the Tuileries? There's
      blood to let, and we're to let it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good, my leeches!" said Parpon; "you shall have blood to suck. But we'll
      leave the English be. France first, then our dogs will take a snap at the
      flag on the citadel yonder." He nodded in the direction of Quebec.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lagroin then put five gold pieces each into the hands of Muroc and
      Duclosse, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I take you into the service of Prince Valmond Napoleon, and you do hereby
      swear to serve him loyally, even to the shedding of your blood, for his
      honour and the honour of France; and you do also vow to require a like
      loyalty and obedience of all men under your command. Swear."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a slight pause, for the old man's voice had the ring of a fatal
      earnestness. It was no farce, but a real thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Swear," he said again. "Raise your right hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Done!" said Muroc. "To the devil with the charcoal! I'll go wash my
      face."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's my hand on it," added Duclosse; "but that rascal Petrie will get
      my trade, and I'd rather be strung by the Orleans than that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Till I've no more wind in my bellows!" responded Lajeunesse, raising his
      hand, "if he keeps faith with my Madelinette."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the honour of a soldier," said Lagroin, and he crossed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God save us all!" said Parpon. Obeying a motion of the dwarf's hand,
      Lagroin drew from his pocket a flask of cognac, with four little tin cups
      fitting into each other. Handing one to each, he poured them brimming
      full. Then, filling his own, he spilled a little in the steely dust of the
      smithy floor. All did the same, though they knew not why.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that for?" asked the mealman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To show the Little Corporal, dear Corporal Violet, and my comrades of the
      Old Guard, that we don't forget them," cried Lagroin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drank slowly, holding his head far back, and as he brought it straight
      again, he swung on his heel, for two tears were racing down his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mealman wiped his eyes in sympathy; the charcoalman shook his head at
      the blacksmith, as though to say, "Poor devil!" and Parpon straightway
      filled their glasses again. Madelinette took the flask to the old
      sergeant. He looked at her kindly, and patted her shoulder. Then he raised
      his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, the brave Caron, the dear Lucette Caron! Ah, the time she dragged me
      from under the Russian's mare!" He smiled into the distance. "Who can
      tell? Perhaps, perhaps&mdash;again!" he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, all at once, as if conscious of the pitiful humour of his
      meditations, he came to his feet, straightened his shoulders, and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      "To her we love best!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The charcoalman drank, and smacked his lips. "Yes, yes," he said, looking
      into the cup admiringly; "like mother's milk that. White of my eye, but I
      do love her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The mealman cocked his glance towards the open door. "Elise!" he said
      sentimentally, and drank. The blacksmith kissed his daughter, and his hand
      rested on her head as he lifted the cup, but he said never a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parpon took one sip, then poured his liquor upon the ground, as though
      down there was what he loved best; but his eyes were turned to Dalgrothe
      Mountain, which he could see through the open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "France!" cried the old soldier stoutly, and tossed off the liquor.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      That night Valmond and his three new recruits, to whom Garotte the
      limeburner had been added, met in the smithy and swore fealty to the great
      cause. Lajeunesse, by virtue of his position in the parish, and his former
      military experience, was made a captain, and the others sergeants of
      companies yet unnamed and unformed. The limeburner was a dry, thin man of
      no particular stature, who coughed a little between his sentences, and had
      a habit, when not talking, of humming to himself, as if in apology for his
      silence. This humming had no sort of tune or purpose, and was but a vague
      musical sputtering. He almost perilled the gravity of the oath they all
      took to Valmond by this idiosyncrasy. His occupation gave him a lean, arid
      look; his hair was crisp and straight, shooting out at all points, and it
      flew to meet his cap as if it were alive. He was a genius after a fashion,
      too, and at all the feasts and on national holidays he invented some new
      feature in the entertainments. With an eye for the grotesque, he had
      formed a company of jovial blades, called Kalathumpians, after the manner
      of the mimes of old times in his beloved Dauphiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, all right," he said, when Lagroin, in the half-lighted
      blacksmith shop, asked him to swear allegiance and service. "'Brigadier,
      vous avez raison,'" he added, quoting a well-known song. Then he hummed a
      little and coughed. "We must have a show"&mdash;he hummed again&mdash;"we
      must tickle 'em up a bit&mdash;touch 'em where they're silly with a fiddle
      and fife-raddy dee dee, ra dee, ra dee, ra dee!" Then, to Valmond: "We
      gave the fools who fought the Little Corporal sour apples in Dauphiny, my
      dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed this extraordinary speech with a plan for making an ingenious
      coup for Valmond, when his Kalathumpians should parade the streets on the
      evening of St. John the Baptist's Day.
    </p>
    <p>
      With hands clasped the new recruits sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "When from the war we come,
          Allons gai!
          Oh, when we ride back home,
          If we be spared that day,
          Ma luronne lurette,
          We'll laugh our scars away,
          Ma luronne lure,
          We'll lift the latch and stay,
          Ma luronne lure."
</pre>
    <p>
      The huge frame of the blacksmith, his love for his daughter, his simple
      faith in this new creed of patriotism, his tenderness of heart, joined to
      his irascible disposition, spasmodic humour, and strong arm, roused in
      Valmond an immediate liking, as keen, after its kind, as that he had for
      the Cure; and the avocat. With both of these he had had long talks of
      late, on everything but purely personal matters. They would have thought
      it a gross breach of etiquette to question him on that which he avoided.
      His admiration of them was complete, although he sometimes laughed half
      sadly, half whimsically, as he thought of their simple faith in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dusk on the eve of St. John the Baptist's Day, after a long conference
      with Lagroin and Parpon, Valmond went through the village, and came to the
      smithy to talk with Lajeunesse. Those who recognised him in passing took
      off their bonnets rouges, some saying, "Good-night, your Highness;" some,
      "How are you, monseigneur?" some, "God bless your Excellency;" and a batch
      of bacchanalian river-men, who had been drinking, called him "General,"
      and insisted on embracing him, offering him cognac from their tin flasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance among them of old Madame Degardy shifted the good-natured
      attack. For many a year, winter and summer, she had come and gone in the
      parish, all rags and tatters, wearing men's kneeboots and cap, her grey
      hair hanging down in straggling curls, her lower lip thrust out fiercely,
      her quick eyes wandering to and fro, and her sharp tongue, like Parpon's,
      clearing a path before her whichever way she turned. On her arm she
      carried a little basket of cakes and confitures, and these she dreamed she
      sold, for they were few who bought of Crazy Joan. The stout stick she
      carried was as compelling as her tongue, so that when the river-men
      surrounded her in amiable derision, it was used freely and with a heart
      all kindness: "For the good of their souls," she said, "since the Cure was
      too mild, Mary in heaven bless him high and low!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the Cure's champion everywhere, and he in turn was tender towards
      the homeless body, whose history even to him was obscure, save in the few
      particulars that he had given to Valmond the last time they had met.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her youth Madame Degardy was pretty and much admired. Her lover had
      deserted her, and in a fit of mad indignation and despair she had fled
      from the village, and vanished no one knew where, though it had been
      declared by a wandering hunter that she had been seen in the far-off hills
      that march into the south, and that she lived there with a barbarous
      mountaineer, who had himself long been an outlaw from his kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this had been mere gossip, and after twenty-five years she came back
      to Pontiac, a half-mad creature, and took up the thread of her life alone;
      and Parpon and the Cure saw that she suffered nothing in the hard winters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond left the river-men to the tyranny of her tongue and stick, and
      came on to where the red light of the forge showed through the smithy
      window. As he neared the door, he heard a voice singularly sweet, and
      another of commoner calibre was joining in the refrain of a song:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    "'Oh, traveller, see where the red sparks rise,'
     (Fly away, my heart, fly away!)
     But dark is the mist in the traveller's eyes.
     (Fly away, my heart, fly away!)
     'Oh, traveller, see far down the gorge,
     The crimson light from my father's forge.
     (Fly away, my heart, fly away!)

    "'Oh, traveller, hear how the anvils ring.'
     (Fly away, my heart, fly away!)
     But the traveller heard, ah, never a thing.
     (Fly away, my heart, fly away!)
     'Oh, traveller, loud do the bellows roar,
     And my father waits by the smithy door.
     (Fly away, my heart, fly away!)

    "'Oh, traveller, see you thy true love's grace.'
     (Fly away, my heart, fly away!)
     And now there is joy in the traveller's face.
     (Fly away, my heart, fly away!)
     Oh, wild does he ride through the rain and mire,
     To greet his love by the smithy fire.
     (Fly away, my heart, fly away!)"
</pre>
    <p>
      In accompaniment, some one was beating softly on the anvil, and the
      bellows were blowing rhythmically.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lingered for a moment, loath to interrupt the song, and then softly
      opened the upper half of the door, for it was divided horizontally, and
      leaned over the lower part.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside the bellows, her sleeves rolled up, her glowing face cowled in her
      black hair, comely and strong, stood Elise Malboir, pushing a rod of steel
      into the sputtering coals. Over the anvil, with a small bar caught in a
      pair of tongs, hovered Madelinette Lajeunesse, beating, almost tenderly,
      the red-hot point of the steel. The sound of the iron hammer on the
      malleable metal was like muffled silver, and the sparks flew out like
      jocund fireflies. She was making two hooks for her kitchen wall, for she
      was clever at the forge, and could shoe a horse if she were let to do so.
      She was but half-turned to Valmond, but he caught the pure outlines of her
      face and neck, her extreme delicacy of expression, which had a pathetic,
      subtle refinement, in acute contrast to the quick, abundant health, the
      warm energy, the half defiant look of Elise. It was a picture of labour
      and life.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dozen thoughts ran through Valmond's mind. He was responsible, to an
      extent, for the happiness of these two young creatures. He had promised to
      make a songstress of the one, to send her to Paris; had roused in her
      wild, ambitious hopes of fame and fortune&mdash;dreams that, in any case,
      could be little like the real thing: fanciful visions of conquest and
      golden living, where never the breath of her hawthorn and wild violets
      entered; only sickly perfumes, as from an odalisque's fan, amid the
      enervating splendour of voluptuous boudoirs&mdash;for she had read of
      these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond had, in a vague, graceless sort of way, worked upon the quick
      emotions of Elise. Every little touch of courtesy had been returned to him
      in half-shy, half-ardent glances; in flushes, which the kiss he had given
      her the first day of their meeting had made the signs of an intermittent
      fever; in modest yet alluring waylayings; in restless nights, in
      half-tuneful, half-silent days; in a sweet sort of petulance. She had kept
      in mind everything he had said to her; the playfully emotional pressure of
      her hand, his eloquent talks with her uncle, the old sergeant's rhapsodies
      on his greatness; and there was no place in the room where he had sat or
      stood, which she had not made sacred&mdash;she, the mad cap, who had
      lovers by the dozen. Importuned by the Cure and her mother to marry, she
      had threatened, if they worried her further, to wed fat Duclosse, the
      mealman, who had courted her in a ponderous way for at least three years.
      The fire that corrodes, when it does not make glorious without and within,
      was in her veins, and when Valmond should call she was ready to come. She
      could not, at first, see that if he were, in truth, a Napoleon, she was
      not for him. Seized of that wilful, daring spirit called Love, her sight
      was bounded by the little field where she strayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elise's arm paused upon the lever of the bellows, when she saw Valmond
      watching them from the door. He took off his hat to them, as Madelinette
      turned towards him, the hammer pausing in the stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, monseigneur!" she said impulsively, and then paused, confused. Elise
      did not move, but stood looking at him, her eyes all flame, her cheeks
      going a little pale, and flushing again. With a quick motion she pushed
      her hair back, and as he stepped inside and closed the door behind him,
      she blew the bellows, as if to give a brighter light to the place. The
      fire flared up, but there were corners in deep shadow. Valmond doffed his
      hat again and said ceremoniously: "Mademoiselle Madelinette, Mademoiselle
      Elise, pray do not stop your work. Let me sit here and watch you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking from his pocket a cigarette, he came over to the forge and was
      about to light it with the red steel from the fire, when Elise, snatching
      up a tiny piece of wood, thrust it in the coals, and, drawing it out, held
      it towards the cigarette, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, no, your Excellency&mdash;this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As Valmond reached to take it from her, he heard a sound, as of a hoarse
      breathing, and turned quickly; but his outstretched hand touched Elise's
      fingers, and it involuntarily closed on them, all her impulsive
      temperament and warm life thrilling through him. The shock of feeling
      brought his eyes to hers with a sudden burning mastery. For an instant
      their looks fused and were lost in a passionate affiance. Then, as if
      pulling himself out of a dream, he released her fingers with a "Pardon&mdash;my
      child!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As he did so, a cry ran through the smithy. Madelinette was standing,
      tense and set with terror, her eyes riveted on something that crouched
      beside a pile of cart-wheels a few feet away; something with shaggy head,
      flaring eyes, and a devilish face. The thing raised itself and sprang
      towards hers with a devouring cry. With desperate swiftness leaping
      forward, Valmond caught the half man, half beast&mdash;it seemed that&mdash;by
      the throat. Madelinette fell fainting against the anvil, and, dazed and
      trembling, Elise hurried to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond was in the grasp of a giant, and, struggle as he might, he could
      not withstand the powerful arms of his assailant. They came to their knees
      on the ground, where they clutched and strained for a wild minute, Valmond
      desperately fighting to keep the huge bony fingers from his neck. Suddenly
      the giant's knee touched the red-hot steel that Madelinette had dropped,
      and with a snarl he flung Valmond back against the anvil, his head
      striking the iron with a sickening thud. Then, seizing the steel, he
      raised it to plunge the still glowing point into Valmond's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Centuries of doom seemed crowded into that instant of time. Valmond caught
      the giant's wrist with both hands, and with a mighty effort wrenched
      himself aside. His heart seemed to strain and burst, and just as he felt
      the end was come, he heard something crash on the murderer's skull, and
      the great creature fell with a gurgling sound, and lay like a parcel of
      loose bones across his knees. Valmond raised himself, a strange, dull
      wonder on him, for as the weapon smote this lifeless creature, he had seen
      another hurl by and strike the opposite wall. A moment afterwards the dead
      man was pulled away by Parpon. Trying to rise he felt blood trickling down
      his neck, and he turned sick and blind. As the world slipped away from
      him, a soft shoulder caught his head, and out of a vast distance there
      came to him the wailing cry: "He is dying! my love! my love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Peril and horror had brought to Elise's breast the one being in the world
      for her, the face which was etched like a picture upon her eyes and heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parpon groaned with a strange horror as he dragged the body from Valmond.
      For a moment he knelt gasping beside the shapeless being, his great hands
      spasmodically feeling the pulseless breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon afterwards in the blacksmith's house the two girls nestled in each
      other's arms, and Valmond, shaken and weak, returned to the smithy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dull glare of the forge fire knelt Parpon, rocking back and forth
      beside the body. Hearing Valmond, he got to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have killed him," he said, pointing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, not I," answered Valmond. "Some one threw a hammer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There were two hammers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was Elise?" asked Valmond, with a shudder. "No, not Elise; it was
      you," said the dwarf, with a strange insistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you no," said Valmond. "It was you, Parpon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God, it is a lie!" cried the dwarf, with a groan. Then he came close
      to Valmond. "He was&mdash;my brother! Do you not see?" he demanded
      fiercely, his eyes full of misery. "Do you not see that it was you? Yes,
      yes, it was you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stooping, Valmond caught the little man in an embrace. "It was I that
      killed him, Parpon. It was I, comrade. You saved my life," he added
      significantly. "The girl threw, but missed," said Parpon. "She does not
      know but that she struck him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She must be told."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell her that you killed him. Leave it to me&mdash;all to me, my
      grand seigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      A half-hour afterwards the avocat, the Cure, and the Little Chemist, had
      heard the story as the dwarf told it, and Valmond returned to the Louis
      Quinze a hero. For hours the habitants gathered under his window and
      cheered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parpon sat long in gloomy silence by his side, but, raising his voice, he
      began to sing softly a lament for the gross-figured body, lying alone in a
      shed near the deserted smithy:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       "Children, the house is empty,
        The house behind the tall hill;
        Lonely and still is the empty house.
        There is no face in the doorway,
        There is no fire in the chimney.
        Come and gather beside the gate,
        Little Good Folk of the Scarlet Hills.

       "Where has the wild dog vanished?
        Where has the swift foot gone?
        Where is the hand that found the good fruit,
        That made a garret of wholesome herbs?
        Where is the voice that awoke the morn,
        The tongue that defied the terrible beasts?
        Come and listen beside the door,
        Little Good Folk of the Scarlet Hills."
</pre>
    <p>
      The pathos of the chant almost made his listener shrink, so immediate and
      searching was it. When the lament ceased, there was a long silence, broken
      by Valmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was your brother, Parpon&mdash;how? Tell me about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The dwarf's eyes looked into the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was in the far-off country," he said, "in the hills where the Little
      Good Folk come. My mother married an outlaw. Ah, he was cruel, and an
      animal! My brother Gabriel was born&mdash;he was a giant, his brain all
      fumbling and wild. Then I was born, so small, a head as a tub, and long
      arms like a gorilla. We burrowed in the hills, Gabriel and I. One day my
      mother, because my father struck her, went mad, left us and came to&mdash;"
      He broke off, pausing an instant. "Then Gabriel struck the man, and he
      died, and we buried him, and my brother also left me, and I was alone. By
      and by I travelled to Pontiac. Once Gabriel came down from the hills, and
      Lajeunesse burnt him with a hot iron, for cutting his bellows in the
      night, to make himself a bed inside them. To-day he came again to do some
      terrible thing to the blacksmith or the girl, and you have seen&mdash;ah,
      the poor Gabriel, and I killed him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I killed him," said Valmond&mdash;"I, Parpon, my friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My poor fool, my wild dog!" wailed the dwarf mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Parpon," asked Valmond suddenly, "where is your mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is no matter. She has forgotten&mdash;she is safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she should see him!" said Valmond tentatively, for a sudden thought
      had come to him that the mother of these misfits of God was Madame
      Degardy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parpon sprang to his-feet. "She shall not see him. Ah, you know! You have
      guessed?" he cried. "She is all safe with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She shall not see him. She shall not know," repeated the dwarf, his eyes
      huddling back in his head with anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does she not remember you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She does not remember the living, but she would remember the dead. She
      shall not know," he said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, seizing Valmond's hand, he kissed it, and, without a word, trotted
      from the room&mdash;a ludicrously pathetic figure.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now and again the moon showed through the cloudy night, and the air was
      soft and kind. Parpon left behind him the village street, and, after a
      half mile or more of travel, came to a spot where a crimson light showed
      beyond a little hill. He halted a moment, as if to think and listen, then
      crawled up the bank and looked down. Beside a still smoking lime-kiln an
      abandoned fire was burning down into red coals. The little hut of the
      lime-burner was beyond in a hollow, and behind that again was a lean-to,
      like a small shed or stable. Hither stole the dwarf, first pausing to
      listen a moment at the door of the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning into the darkness of the shed, he gave a soft, crooning call. Low
      growls of dogs came in quick reply. He stepped inside, and spoke to them:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good dogs! good dogs! good Musket, Coffee, Filthy, Jo-Jo&mdash;steady,
      steady, idiots!" for the huge brutes were nosing him, throwing themselves
      against: him, and whining gratefully. Feeling the wall, he took down some
      harness, and, in the dark, put a set on each dog&mdash;mere straps for the
      shoulders, halters, and traces; called to them sharply to be quiet, and,
      keeping hold of their collars, led them out into the night. He paused to
      listen again. Presently he drove the dogs across the road, and attached
      them to a flat vehicle, without wheels or runners, used by Garotte for the
      drawing of lime and stones. It was not so heavy as many machines of the
      kind, and at a quick word from the dwarf the dogs darted away. Unseen, a
      mysterious figure hurried on after them, keeping well in the shadow of the
      trees fringing the side of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dwarf drove the dogs down a lonely side lane to the village, and came
      to the shed where lay the uncomely thing he had called brother. He felt
      for a spot where there was a loose board, forced it and another with his
      strong fingers, and crawled in. Reappearing with the dead body, he bore it
      in his huge arms to the stoneboat: a midget carrying a giant. He covered
      up the face, and, returning to the shed, placed his coat against the
      boards to deaden the sound, and hammered them tight again with a stone,
      after having straightened the grass about. Returning, he found the dogs
      cowering with fear, for one of them had pushed the cloth off the dead
      man's face with his nose, and death exercised its weird dominion over
      them. They crouched together, whining and tugging at the traces. With a
      persuasive word he started them away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pursuing, watchful figure followed at a distance, on up the road, on
      over the little hills, on into the high hills, the dogs carrying along
      steadily the grisly load. And once their driver halted them, and sat in
      the grey gloom and dust beside the dead body.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where do you go, dwarf?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I go to the Ancient House," he made answer to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you get?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not go to get; I go to give."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you go to give?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I go to leave an empty basket at the door, and the lantern that the
      Shopkeeper set in the hand of the pedlar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is the pedlar, hunchback?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The pedlar is he that carries the pack on his back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What carries he in the pack?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He carries what the Shopkeeper gave him&mdash;for he had no money and no
      choice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is the Shopkeeper, dwarf?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Shopkeeper&mdash;the Shopkeeper is the father of dwarfs and angels
      and children&mdash;and fools."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does he sell, poor man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He sells harness for men and cattle, and you give your lives for the
      harness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is this you carry, dwarf?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I carry home the harness of a soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it worth carrying home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The eyes grow sick at sight of the old harness in the way."
    </p>
    <p>
      The watching figure, hearing, pitied.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Valmond. Excited by Parpon's last words at the hotel, he had
      followed, and was keen to chase this strange journeying to the end, though
      suffering from the wound in his head, and shaken by the awful accident of
      the evening. But, as he said to himself; some things were to be seen but
      once in the great game, and it was worth while seeing them, even if life
      were the shorter for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On up the heights filed the strange procession until at last it came to
      Dalgrothe Mountain. On one of the foot-hills stood the Rock of Red
      Pigeons. This was the dwarf's secret resort, where no one ever disturbed
      him; for the Little Good Folk of the Scarlet Hills (of whom it was
      rumoured, he had come) held revel there, and people did not venture
      rashly. The land about it, and a hut farther down the hill, belonged to
      Parpon; a legacy from the father of the young Seigneur.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all hills, gorges, rivers, and idle, murmuring pines. Of a morning,
      mist floated into mist as far as eye could see, blue and grey and
      amethyst, a glamour of tints and velvety radiance. The great hills waved
      into each other like a vast violet sea, and, in turn, the tiny earth-waves
      on each separate hill swelled into the larger harmony. At the foot of a
      steep precipice was the whirlpool from which Parpon, at great risk, had
      rescued the father of De la Riviere, and had received this lonely region
      as his reward. To the dwarf it was his other world, his real home; for
      here he lived his own life, and it was here he had brought his ungainly
      dead, to give it housing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dogs drew up the grim cargo to a plateau near the Rock of Red Pigeons,
      and, gathering sticks, Parpon lit a sweet-smelling fire of cedar. Then he
      went to the hut, and came back with a spade and a shovel. At the foot of a
      great pine he began to dig. As the work went on, he broke into a sort of
      dirge, painfully sweet. Leaning against a rock not far away, Valmond
      watched the tiny man with the long arms throw up the soft, good-smelling
      earth, enriched by centuries of dead leaves and flowers. The trees waved
      and bent and murmured, as though they gossiped with each other over this
      odd gravedigger. The light of the fire showed across the gorge, touching
      off the far wall of pines with burnished crimson, and huge flickering
      shadows looked like elusive spirits, attendant on the lonely obsequies.
      Now and then a bird, aroused by the flame or the snap of a burning stick,
      rose from its nest and flew away; and wild-fowl flitted darkly down the
      pass, like the souls of heroes faring to Walhalla. When an owl hooted, a
      wolf howled far off, or a loon cried from the water below; the solemn
      fantasy took on the aspect of the unreal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond watched like one in a dream, and twice or thrice he turned faint,
      and drew his cloak about him as if he were cold; for a sickly air, passing
      by, seemed to fill his lungs with poison.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the grave was dug, and, sprinkling its depth with leaves and soft
      branches of spruce, the dwarf drew the body over, and lowered it slowly,
      awkwardly, into the grave. Then he covered all but the huge, unlovely
      face, and, kneeling, peered down at it pitifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gabriel, Gabriel," he cried, "surely thy soul is better without its
      harness! I killed thee, and thou didst kill, and those we love die by our
      own hands. But no, I lie; I did not love thee, thou wert so ugly and wild
      and cruel. Poor boy! Thou wast a fool, and thou wast a murderer. Thou
      wouldst have slain my prince, and so I slew thee&mdash;I slew thee."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rocked to and fro in abject sorrow, and cried again: "Hast thou no one
      in all the world to mourn thee, save him who killed thee? Is there no one
      to wish thee speed to the Ancient House? Art thou tossed away like an old
      shoe, and no one to say, The Shoemaker that made thee must see to it if
      thou wast ill-shapen, and walked crookedly, and did evil things? Ah, is
      there no one to mourn thee, save him that killed thee?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned back, and cried out into the high hills like a remorseful,
      tortured soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond, no longer able to watch this grief in silence, stepped quickly
      forward. The dogs, seeing him, barked, and then were still; and the dwarf
      looked up as he heard footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another has come to mourn him, Parpon," said Valmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      A look of bewilderment and joy swam into Parpon's eyes. Then he gave a
      laugh of singular wildness, his face twitched, tears rushed down his
      cheeks, and he threw himself at Valmond's feet, and clasped his knees,
      crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah-ah, my prince, great brother, thou hast come also! Ah, thou didst know
      the way up the long hill Thou hast come to the burial of a fool. But he
      had a mother&mdash;yes, yes, a mother! All fools have mothers, and they
      should be buried well. Come, ah, come, and speak softly the Act of
      Contrition, and I will cover him up."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to throw in the earth, but Valmond pushed him aside gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," he said, "this is for me." And he began filling the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they left the place of burial, the fire was burning low, for they had
      talked long. At the foot of the hills they looked back. Day was beginning
      to break over Dalgrothe Mountain.

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      When, next day, in the bright sunlight, the Little Chemist, the Cure, and
      others, opened the door of the shed, taking off their hats in the presence
      of the Master Workman, they saw that his seat was empty. The dead Caliban
      was gone&mdash;who should say how, or where? The lock was still on the
      doors, the walls were intact, there was no window for entrance or escape.
      He had vanished as weirdly as he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day the people sought the place, viewing with awe and superstition the
      shed of death, and the spot in the smithy where, it was said, Valmond had
      killed the giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day following was the feast of St. John the Baptist. Mass was said in
      the church, all the parish attending; and Valmond was present, with
      Lagroin in full regimentals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plates of blessed bread were passed round at the close of mass, as was the
      custom on this feast-day; and with a curious feeling that came to him
      often afterwards, Valmond listened to his General saying solemnly:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "Holy bread, I take thee;
          If I die suddenly,
          Serve me as a sacrament."
</pre>
    <p>
      With many eyes watching him curiously, he also ate the bread, repeating
      the holy words.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day there were sports and processions, the habitants gay in rosettes
      and ribbons, flowers and maple leaves, as they idled or filed along the
      streets, under arches of evergreens, where the Tricolor and Union Jack
      mingled and fluttered amiably together. Anvils, with powder placed
      between, were touched off with a bar of red-hot iron, making a vast noise
      and drawing applausive crowds to the smithy. On the hill beside the Cure's
      house was a little old cannon brought from the battle-field of
      Ticonderoga, and its boisterous salutations were replied to from the
      Seigneury, by a still more ancient piece of ordnance. Sixty of Valmond's
      recruits, under Lajeunesse the blacksmith, marched up and down the
      streets, firing salutes with a happy, casual intrepidity, and setting
      themselves off before the crowds with a good many airs and nods and simple
      vanities.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early evening the good Cure blessed and lighted the great bonfire
      before the church; and immediately, at this signal, an answering fire
      sprang up on a hill at the other side of the village. Then fire on fire
      glittered and multiplied, till all the village was in a glow. This was a
      custom set in memory of the old days when fires flashed intelligence,
      after a fixed code, across the great rivers and lakes, and from hill to
      hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far up against Dalgrothe Mountain appeared a sumptuous star, mystical and
      red. Valmond saw it from his window, and knew it to be Parpon's watchfire,
      by the grave of his brother Gabriel. The chief procession started with the
      lighting of the bonfires: Singing softly, choristers and acolytes in robes
      preceded the devout Cure, and pious believers and youths on horseback,
      with ribbons flying, carried banners and shrines. Marshals kept the lines
      steady, and four were in constant attendance on a gorgeous carriage, all
      gilt and carving (the heirloom of the parish), in which reclined the
      figure of a handsome lad, impersonating John the Baptist, with long golden
      hair, dressed in rich robes and skins&mdash;a sceptre in his hand, a snowy
      lamb at his feet. The rude symbolism was softened and toned to an almost
      poetical refinement, and gave to the harmless revels a touch of Arcady.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this semi-religious procession, evening brought the march of
      Garotte's Kalathumpians. They were carried on three long drays, each drawn
      by four horses, half of them white, half black. They were an outlandish
      crew of comedians, dressed after no pattern, save the absurd-clowns,
      satyrs, kings, soldiers, imps, barbarians. Many had hideous false-faces,
      and a few horribly tall skeletons had heads of pumpkins containing lighted
      candles. The marshals were pierrots and clowns on long stilts, who towered
      in a ghostly way above the crowd. They were cheerful, fantastic revellers,
      singing the maddest and silliest of songs, with singular refrains and
      repetitions. The last line of one verse was the beginning of another:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "A Saint Malo, beau port de mer,
          Trois gros navir' sont arrives.

          Trois gros navir' sont arrives
          Charges d'avoin', charges de ble."
</pre>
    <p>
      For an hour and more their fantastic songs delighted the simple folk. They
      stopped at last in front of the Louis Quinze. The windows of Valmond's
      chambers were alight, and to one a staff was fastened. Suddenly the
      Kalathumpians quieted where they stood, for the voice of their leader, a
      sort of fat King of Yvetot, cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "See there, my noisy children!" It was the inventive lime-burner who
      spoke. "What come you here for, my rollicking blades?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are a long way from home; we are looking for our brother, your
      Majesty," they cried in chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, ha! What is your brother like, jolly dogs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has a face of ivory, and eyes like torches, and he carries a silver
      sword."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what the devil is his face like ivory for, my fanfarons?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that he shall not blush for us. He is a grand seigneur," they shouted
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why are his eyes like torches, my ragamuffins?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To show us the way home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond appeared upon the balcony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it you wish, my children?" he asked. "Brother," said the
      fantastic leader, "we've lost our way. Will you lead us home again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a long travel," he answered, after the fashion of their own
      symbols. "There are high hills to climb; there may be wild beasts in the
      way; and storms come down the mountains."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have strong hearts, and you have a silver sword, brother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot see your faces, to know if you are true, my children," he
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the clothes flew off, masks fell, pumpkins came crashing to the
      ground, the stilts of the marshals dropped, and thirty men stood upon the
      drays in crude military order, with muskets in their hands and cockades in
      their caps. At that moment also, a flag&mdash;the Tricolor&mdash;fluttered
      upon the staff at Valmond's window. The roll of a drum came out of the
      street somewhere, and presently the people fell back before sixty armed
      men, marching in columns, under Lagroin, while from the opposite direction
      came Lajeunesse with sixty others, silent all, till they reached the drays
      and formed round them slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond stood watching intently, and the people were very still, for this
      seemed like real life, and no burlesque. Some of the soldiery had military
      clothes, old militia uniforms, or the rebel trappings of '37; others, less
      fortunate, wore their trousers in long boots, their coats buttoned lightly
      over their chests, and belted in; and the Napoleonic cockade was in every
      cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My children," said Valmond at last, "I see that your hearts are strong,
      and that you have the bodies of true men. We have sworn fealty to each
      other, and the badge of our love is in your caps. Let us begin our journey
      home. I will come down among you: I will come down among you, and I will
      lead you from Pontiac to the sea, gathering comrades as we go; then across
      the sea, to France; then to Paris and the Tuileries, where an Orleans
      usurps the place of a Napoleon."
    </p>
    <p>
      He descended and mounted his waiting horse. At that moment De la Riviere
      appeared on the balcony, and, stepping forward, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friends, do you know what you are doing? This is folly. This man&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He got no further, for Valmond raised his hand to Lagroin, and the drums
      began to beat. Then he rode down in front of Lajeunesse's men, the others
      sprang from the drays and fell into place, and soon the little army was
      marching, four deep, through the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the official beginning of Valmond's fanciful quest for empire.
      The people had a phrase, and they had a man; and they saw no further than
      the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they filed past the house of Elise Malboir, the girl stood in the glow
      of a bonfire, beside the oven where Valmond had first seen her. All around
      her was the wide awe of night, enriched by the sweet perfume of a coming
      harvest. He doffed his hat to her, then to the Tricolor, which Lagroin had
      fastened on a tall staff before the house. Elise did not stir, did not
      courtesy or bow, but stood silent&mdash;entranced. She was in a dream.
      This man, riding at the head of the simple villagers, was part of her
      vision; and, at the moment, she did not rouse from the ecstasy of reverie
      where her new-born love had led her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Valmond the scene had a moving power. He heard again her voice crying
      in the smithy: "He is dying! Oh, my love! my love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now in the heart of a fantastical adventure. Filled with its
      spirit, he would carry it bravely to the end, enjoying every step in it,
      comedy or tragedy. Yet all day, since he had eaten the sacred bread, there
      had been ringing in his ears the words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
            "Holy bread, I take thee;
             If I die suddenly,
             Serve me as a sacrament."
</pre>
    <p>
      It came home to him, at the instant, what a toss-up it all was. What was
      he doing? No matter: it was a game, in which nothing was sure&mdash;nothing
      save this girl. She would, he knew, with the abandon of an absorbing
      passion, throw all things away for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such as Madame Chalice&mdash;ah, she was a part of this brave fantasy,
      this dream of empire, this inspiring play! But Elise Malboir was life
      itself, absolute, true, abiding. His nature swam gloriously in his daring
      exploit; he believed in it, he sank himself in it with a joyous
      recklessness; it was his victory or his doom. But it was a shake of the
      dice&mdash;had Fate loaded them against him?
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up the hill towards the Manor. Life was there in its essence;
      beauty, talent, the genius of the dreamer, like his own. But it was not
      for him; dauphin or fool, it was not for him! Madame Chalice was his
      friendly inquisitor, not his enemy; she endured him for some talent he had
      shown, for the apparent sincerity of his love for the cause; but that was
      all. Yet she was ever in this dream of his, and he felt that she would
      always be; the unattainable, the undeserved, more splendid than his cause
      itself&mdash;the cause for which he would give&mdash;what would he give?
      Time would show.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Elise Malboir, abundant, true, fine, in the healthy vigour of her
      nature, with no dream in her heart but love fulfilled&mdash;she was no
      part of his adventure, but of that vital spirit which can bring to the
      humblest as to the highest the good reality of life.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was the poignancy of these feelings which, later, drew Valmond to the
      ashes of the fire in whose glow Elise had stood. The village was quieting
      down, the excited habitants had scattered to their homes. But in one or
      two houses there was dancing, and, as he passed, Valmond heard the
      chansons of the humble games they played&mdash;primitive games, primitive
      chansons:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       "In my right hand I hold a rose-bush,
        Which will bloom, Manon lon la!
        Which will bloom in the month of May.
        Come into our dance, pretty rose-bush,
        Come and kiss, Manon Ion la!
        Come and kiss whom you love best!"
</pre>
    <p>
      The ardour, the delight, the careless joy of youth, were in the song and
      in the dance. These simple folk would marry, beget children, labour hard,
      obey Mother Church, and yield up the ghost peacefully in the end, after
      their kind; but now and then there was born among them one not after their
      kind: even such as Madelinette, with the stirring of talent in her veins,
      and the visions of the artistic temperament&mdash;delight and curse all at
      once&mdash;lifting her out of the life, lonely, and yet sorrowfully happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond looked around. How still it was, the home of Elise standing apart
      in the quiet fields! But involuntarily his eyes were drawn to the hill
      beyond, where showed a light in a window of the Manor. To-morrow he would
      go there: he had much to say to Madame Chalice. The moon was lying off
      above the edge of hills, looking out on the world complacently, like an
      indulgent janitor scanning the sleepy street from his doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was abruptly drawn from his reverie by the entrance of Lagroin into the
      little garden; and he followed the old man through the open doorway. All
      was dark, but as they stepped within they heard some one move. Presently a
      match was struck, and Elise came forward with a candle raised level with
      her dusky head. Lagroin looked at her in indignant astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not see who is here, girl?" he demanded. "Your Excellency!" she
      said confusedly to Valmond, and, bowing, offered him a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must pardon her, sire," said the old sergeant. "She has never been
      taught, and she's a wayward wench."
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond waved his hand. "Nonsense, we are friends. You are my General; she
      is your niece." His eyes followed Elise as she set out for them some
      cider, a small flask of cognac, and some seed-cakes; luxuries which were
      served but once a year in this house, as in most homes of Pontiac.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time Valmond and his General talked, devised, planned, schemed,
      till the old man grew husky and pale. The sight of his senile weariness
      flashed the irony of the whole wild dream into Valmond's mind. He rose,
      and, giving his arm, led Lagroin to his bedroom, and bade him good-night.
      When he returned to the room, it was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked around, and, seeing an open door, moved to it quickly. It led
      into a little stairway.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered then that there was a room which had been, apparently,
      tacked on, like an after-thought, to the end of the house. Seeing the
      glimmer of a light beyond, he went up a few steps, and came face to face
      with Elise, who, candle in hand, was about to descend the stairs again.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she stood quite still, then placed the candle on the rude
      little dressing-table, built of drygoods boxes, and draped with fresh
      muslin. Valmond took in every detail of the chamber at a single glance. It
      was very simple and neat, with the small wooden bedstead corded with rope,
      the poor hickory rocking-chair, the flaunting chromo of the Holy Family,
      the sprig of blessed palm, the shrine of the Virgin, the print skirts
      hanging on the wall, the stockings lying across a chair, the bits of
      ribbon on the bed. The quietness, the alluring simplicity, the whole room
      filled with the rich presence of the girl, sent a flood of colour to
      Valmond's face, and his heart beat hard. Curiosity only had led him into
      the room, something more radical held him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elise seemed to read his thoughts, and, taking up her candle, she came on
      to the doorway. Neither had spoken. As she was about to pass him, he
      suddenly took her arm. But, glancing towards the window, he noticed that
      the blind was not down. He turned and blew out the candle in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, your Excellency!" she cried in tremulous affright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We could have been seen from outside," he explained. She turned and saw
      the moonlight streaming in at the window, and lying like a silver coverlet
      upon the floor. As if with a blind, involuntary instinct for protection,
      she stepped forward into the moonlight, and stood there motionless. The
      sight thrilled him, and he moved towards her. The mind of the girl
      reasserted itself, and she hastened to the door. Again, as she was about
      to pass him, he put his hand upon her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Elise&mdash;Elise!" he said. The voice was persuasive, eloquent, going to
      every far retreat of emotion in her. There was a sudden riot in his veins,
      and he took her passionately in his arms, and kissed her on the lips, on
      the eyes, on the hair, on the neck. At that moment the outer door opened
      below, and the murmur of voices came to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, monsieur&mdash;oh, your Excellency, let me go!" she whispered
      fearfully. "It is my mother and Duclosse the mealman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond recognised the fat, wheezy tones of Duclosse&mdash;Sergeant
      Duclosse. He released her, and she caught up the candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can you do?" she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will wait here. I must not go down," he replied. "It would mean ruin."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruin! ruin! Was she face to face with ruin already, she who, two minutes
      ago, was as safe and happy as a young bird in its nest? He felt instantly
      that he had made a mistake, had been cruel, though he had not intended it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ruin to me," he said at once. "Duclosse is a stupid fellow: he would not
      understand; he would desert me; and that would be disastrous at this
      moment. Go down," he said. "I will wait here, Elise."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brows knitted painfully. "Oh, monsieur, I'd rather face death, I
      believe, than that you should remain here."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he pushed her gently towards the door, and a moment afterwards he
      heard her talking to Duclosse and her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down on the couch and listened for a moment. His veins were still
      glowing from the wild moment just passed. Elise would come back&mdash;and
      then&mdash;what? She would be alone with him again in this room, loving
      him&mdash;fearing him. He remembered that once, when a child, he had seen
      a peasant strike his wife, felling her to the ground; and how afterwards
      she had clasped him round the neck and kissed him, as he bent over her in
      merely vulgar fright lest he had killed her. That scene flashed before
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came an opposing thought. As Madame Chalice had said, either as
      prince or barber, he was playing a terrible game. Why shouldn't he get all
      he could out of it while it lasted&mdash;let the world break over him when
      it must? Why should he stand in an orchard of ripe fruit, and refuse to
      pick what lay luscious to his hand, what this stupid mealman below would
      pick, and eat, and yawn over? There was the point. Wouldn't the girl
      rather have him, Valmond, at any price, than the priest-blessed love of
      Duclosse and his kind?
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought possessed, devoured him for a moment. Then suddenly there
      again rang in his ears the words which had haunted him all day:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "Holy bread, I take thee;
          If I die suddenly,
          Serve me as a sacrament."
</pre>
    <p>
      They passed backwards and forwards in his mind for a little time with no
      significance. Then they gave birth to another thought. Suppose he stayed;
      suppose he took advantage of the love of this girl? He looked around the
      little room, showing so peacefully in the moonlight&mdash;the religious
      symbols, the purity, the cleanliness, the calm poverty. He had known the
      inside of the boudoirs and the bed-chambers of women of fashion&mdash;he
      had seen them, at least. In them the voluptuous, the indulgent, seemed
      part of the picture. But he was not a beast, that he could fail to see
      what this tiny bedroom would be, if he followed his wild will. Some
      terrible fate might overtake his gay pilgrimage to empire, and leave him
      lost, abandoned, in a desert of ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why not give up the adventure, and come to this quiet, and this good
      peace, so shutting out the stir and violence of the world?
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once Madame Chalice came into his thoughts, swam in his sight, and
      he knew that what he felt for this peasant girl was of one side of his
      nature only. All of him worth the having&mdash;was any worth the having?
      responded to that diffusing charm which brought so many men to the feet of
      that lady of the Manor, who had lovers by the score: from such as the Cure
      and the avocat, gentle and noble, and requited, to the young Seigneur,
      selfish and ulterior, and unrequited.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got to his feet quietly. No, he would make a decent exit, in triumph or
      defeat, to honour the woman who was standing his friend. Let them, the
      British Government at Quebec, proceed against him; he would have only one
      trouble to meet, one to leave behind. He would not load this girl with
      shame as well as sorrow. Her love itself was affliction enough to her.
      This adventure was serious; a bullet might drop him; the law might remove
      him: so he would leave here at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to open the window, when he heard a door shut below, and the
      thud of heavy steps outside the house. Drawing back, he waited until he
      heard the foot of Elise upon the stair. She came in without a light, and
      at first did not see him. He heard her gasp. Stepping forward a little, he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am here, Elise. Come."
    </p>
    <p>
      She trembled as she came. "Oh, monsieur&mdash;your Excellency!" she
      whispered; "oh, you cannot go down, for my mother sits ill by the fire.
      You cannot go out that way."
    </p>
    <p>
      He took both her hands. "No matter. Poor child, you are trembling! Come."
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew her towards the couch. She shrank back. "Oh no, monsieur, oh&mdash;I
      die of shame!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no need, Elise," he answered gently, and he sat on the edge of
      the couch, and drew her to his side. "Let us say good-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      She grew very still, and he felt her move towards him, as she divined his
      purpose, and knew that this room of hers would have no shadow in it
      to-morrow, and her soul no unpardonable sin. A warm peace passed through
      her veins, and she drew nearer still. She did not know that this new
      ardent confidence came near to wrecking her. For Valmond had an instant's
      madness, and only saved himself from the tumult in his blood by getting to
      his feet, with strenuous resolution. Taking both her hands, he kissed her
      on the cheeks, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adieu, Elise. May your sorrow never be more, and my happiness never less.
      I am going now."
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt her hand grasp his arm, as if with a desire that he should not
      leave her. Then she rose quickly, and came with him to the window. Raising
      the sash, she held it, and he looked out. There seemed to be no one in the
      road, no one in the yard. So, half turning, he swung himself down by his
      hands, and dropped to the ground. From the window above a sob came to him,
      and Elise's face, all tears, showed for an instant in the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not seek the road directly, but, climbing a fence near by, crossed
      a hay-field, going unseen, as he thought, to the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a lady, walking in the road with an old gentleman, had seen and
      recognised him. Her fingers clinched with anger at the sight, and her
      spirit filled with disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you looking at?" said her companion, who was short-sighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the tricks moonlight plays. Shadows frighten me sometimes, my dear
      avocat." She shuddered. "My dear madame!" he said in warm sympathy.

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sun was going down behind the hills, like a drowsy boy to his bed,
      radiant and weary from his day's sport. The villagers were up at Dalgrothe
      Mountain, soldiering for Valmond. Every evening, when the haymakers put up
      their scythes, the mill-wheel stopped turning, and the Angelus ceased, the
      men marched away into the hills, where the ardent soldier of fortune had
      pitched his camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tents, muskets, ammunition came out of dark places, as they are ever sure
      to come when the war-trumpet sounds. All seems peace, but suddenly, at the
      wild call, the latent barbarian in human nature springs up and is ready;
      and the cruder the arms, the fiercer the temper that wields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recruits now arrived from other parishes, and besides those who came every
      night to drill, there were others who stayed always in camp. The
      lime-burner left his kiln, and sojourned with his dogs at Dalgrothe
      Mountain; the mealman neglected his trade; and Lajeunesse was no longer at
      his blacksmith shop, save after dark, when the red glow of his forge could
      be seen till midnight. He was captain of a company in the daytime,
      forgeron at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond, no longer fantastic in dress, speech, or manner, was happy, busy,
      buoyed up and cast down by turn, troubled, exhilarated. He could not
      understand these variations of health and mood. He had not felt equably
      well since the night of Gabriel's burial in the miasmic air of the
      mountain. At times he felt a wonderful lightness of head and heart, with
      entrancing hopes; again a heaviness and an aching, accompanied by a
      feeling of doom. He fought the depression, and appeared before his men
      cheerful and alert always. He was neither looking back nor looking
      forward, but living in his dramatic theme from day to day, and wondering
      if, after all, this movement, by some joyful, extravagant chance, might
      not carry him on even to the chambers of the Tuileries.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the first day that he had gathered these peasants about him, had
      convinced, almost against their will, the wise men of the village, this
      fanciful exploit had been growing a deep reality to him. He had convinced
      himself; he felt that he could, in a larger sphere, gather thousands about
      him where he now gathered scores&mdash;with a good cause. Well, was his
      cause not good, he asked himself?
    </p>
    <p>
      There were others to whom this growing reality was painful. The young
      Seigneur was serious enough about it, and more than once, irritated and
      perturbed, he sought Madame Chalice; but she gave him no encouragement,
      remarking coldly that Monsieur Valmond probably knew very well what he was
      doing, and was weighing all consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had become interested in a passing drama, and De la Riviere's
      attentions produced no impression on her, and gave her no pleasure. They
      were, however, not obtrusive. She had seen much of him two years before;
      he had been a good friend of her husband. She was amused at his attentions
      then; she had little to occupy her, and she felt herself superior to any
      man's emotions: not such as this young Seigneur could win her away from
      her passive but certain fealty. She had played with fire, from the very
      spirit of adventure in her, but she had not been burnt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say he is an impostor, dear monsieur," she said languidly: "do pray
      exert yourself, and prove him one. What is your evidence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned back in the very chair where she had sat looking at Valmond a
      few weeks before, her fingers idly smoothing out the folds of her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the thing is impossible," he answered, blowing the smoke of a
      cigarette; "we've had no real proof of his birth, and life&mdash;and so
      on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there are relics&mdash;and so on!" she said suggestively, and she
      picked up the miniature of the Emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Owning a skeleton doesn't make it your ancestor," he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, for he was pleased at his own cleverness, and he also wished
      to remain good-tempered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am so glad to see you at last take the true attitude towards this," she
      responded brightly. "If it's a comedy, enjoy it. If it's a tragedy"&mdash;she
      drew herself up with a little shudder, for she was thinking of that figure
      dropping from Elise's window&mdash;"you cannot stop it. Tragedy is
      inevitable; but comedy is within the gift and governance of mortals."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment again she was lost in the thought of Elise, of Valmond's
      vulgarity and commonness; and he had dared to speak words of love almost
      to her! She flushed to the hair, as she had done fifty times since she had
      seen him that moonlit night. Ah, she had thought him the dreamer, the
      enthusiast&mdash;maybe, in kind, credulous moments, the great man he
      claimed to be; and he had only been the sensualist after all! That he did
      not love Elise, she knew well enough: he had been coldblooded; in this, at
      least, he was Napoleonic.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not spoken with him since that night; but she had had two long
      letters superscribed: "In Camp, Headquarters, Dalgrothe Mountain," and
      these had breathed only patriotism, the love of a cause, the warmth of a
      strong, virile temperament, almost a poetical abandon of unnamed ambitions
      and achievements. She had read the letters again and again, for she had
      found it hard to reconcile them with her later knowledge of this man. He
      wrote to her as to an ally, frankly, warmly. She felt the genuine thing in
      him somewhere; and, in spite of all, she felt a sort of kinship for him.
      Yet that scene&mdash;that scene! She flushed with anger again, and, in
      spite of her smiling lips, the young Seigneur saw the flush, and wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The thing must end soon," he said, as he rose to go, for a messenger had
      come for him. "He is injuring the peace, the trade, and the life of the
      parishes; he is gathering men and arms, drilling, exploiting military
      designs in one country, to proceed against another. England is at peace
      with France!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An international matter, this?" she asked sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. The Government at Quebec is English; we are French and he is French;
      and, I repeat, this thing is serious."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled. "I am an American. I have no responsibility."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They might arrest you for aiding and abetting if&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If what, dear and cheerful friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I did not make it right for you." He smiled, approving his own
      kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She touched his arm, and said with ironical sweetness: "How you relieve my
      mind!" Then with delicate insinuation: "I have a lot of old muskets here,
      at least two hundred pounds of powder, and plenty of provisions, and I
      will send them to&mdash;Valmond Napoleon."
    </p>
    <p>
      He instantly became grave. "I warn you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted him. "Nonsense! You warn me!" She laughed mockingly. "I
      warn you, dear Seigneur, that you will be more sorry than satisfied, if
      you meddle in this matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are going to send those things to him?" he asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly&mdash;and food every day." And she kept her word.
    </p>
    <p>
      De la Riviere, as he went down the hill, thought with irritation of how
      ill things were going with him and Madame Chalice&mdash;so different from
      two years ago, when their friendship had first begun. He had remembered
      her with a singular persistency; he had looked forward to her coming back;
      and when she came, his heart had fluttered like a schoolboy's. But things
      had changed. Clearly she was interested in this impostor. Was it the man
      himself or the adventure? He did not know. But the adventure was the man&mdash;and
      who could tell? Once he thought he had detected some warmth for himself in
      her eye, in the clasp of her hand; there was nothing of that sort now. A
      black, ungentlemanly spirit seized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It possessed him most strongly at the moment he was passing the home of
      Elise Malboir. The girl was standing by the gate, looking down towards the
      village. Her brow was a little heavy, so that it gave her eyes at all
      times a deep look, but now De la Riviere saw that they were brooding as
      well. There was sadness in the poise of the head. He did not take off his
      hat to her.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "'Oh, grand to the war he goes,
             O gai, rive le roi!'"
</pre>
    <p>
      he said teasingly. He thought she might have a lover among the recruits at
      Dalgrothe Mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to him, startled, for she thought he meant Valmond. She did not
      speak, but became very still and pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better tie him up with a garter, Elise, and get the old uncle back to
      Ville Bambord. Trouble's coming. The game'll soon be up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What trouble?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Battle, murder, and sudden death," he answered, and passed on with a sour
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slowly repeated his words, looked towards the Manor House, with a
      strange expression, then went up to her little bedroom and sat on the edge
      of the bed for a long time, where she had sat with Valmond. Every word,
      every incident, of that night came back to her; and her heart filled up
      with worship. It flowed over into her eyes and fell upon her clasped
      hands. If trouble did come to him?&mdash;He had given her a new world, he
      should have her life and all else.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half-hour later, De la Riviere came rapping at the Cure's door. The sun
      was almost gone, the smell of the hay-fields floated over the village, and
      all was quiet in the streets. Women gossiped in their doorways, but there
      was no stir anywhere. With the young Seigneur was the member of the
      Legislature for the county. His mood was different from that of his
      previous visit to Pontiac; for he had been told that whether the cavalier
      adventurer was or was not a Napoleon, this campaign was illegal. He had
      made no move. Being a member of the Legislature, he naturally shirked
      responsibility, and he had come to see the young Seigneur, who was justice
      of the peace, and practically mayor of the county. They found the Cure,
      the avocat, and Medallion, talking together amiably.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three were greatly distressed by the representations of the member and
      De la Riviere. The Cure turned to Monsieur Garon, the avocat, inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The law&mdash;the law of the case is clear," said the avocat helplessly.
      "If the peace is disturbed, if there is conspiracy to injure a country not
      at war with our own, if arms are borne with menace, if His Excellency&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His Excellency&mdash;my faith!&mdash;You're an ass, Garon!" cried the
      young Seigneur, with an angry sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      For once in his life the avocat bridled up. He got to his feet, and stood
      silent an instant, raising himself up and down on his tiptoes, his lips
      compressed, his small body suddenly contracting to a firmness, and grown
      to a height, his eyelids working quickly. To the end of his life the Cure
      remembered and talked of the moment when the avocat gave battle. To him it
      was superb&mdash;he never could have done it himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I repeat, His Excellency, Monsieur De la Riviere. My information is
      greater than yours, both by accident and through knowledge. I accept him
      as a Napoleon, and as a Frenchman I have no cause to blush for my homage
      or my faith, or for His Excellency. He is a man of loving disposition, of
      great knowledge, of power to win men, of deep ideas, of large courage.
      Monsieur, I cannot forget the tragedy he stayed at the smithy, with risk
      of his own life. I cannot forget&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure, anticipating, nodded at him encouragingly. Probably the avocat
      intended to say something quite different, but the look in the Cure's eyes
      prompted him, and he continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot forget that he has given to the poor, and liberally to the
      Church, and has promised benefits to the deserving&mdash;ah, no, no, my
      dear Seigneur!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had delivered his speech in a quaint, quick way, as though addressing a
      jury, and when he had finished, he sat down again, and nodded his head,
      and tapped a foot on the floor; and the Cure did the same, looking
      inquiringly at De la Riviere.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the first time there had been trouble in the little coterie. They
      had never differed painfully before. Tall Medallion longed to say
      something, but he waited for the Cure to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your mind, Monsieur le Cure?" asked De la Riviere testily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear friend, Monsieur Garon, has answered for us both," replied the
      Cure quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to say that you will not act with me to stop this thing," he
      urged&mdash;"not even for the safety of the people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The reply was calm and resolute:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My people shall have my prayers and my life, when needed, but I do not
      feel called upon to act for the State. I have the honour to be a friend of
      His Excellency."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Heaven, the State shall act!" cried De la Riviere, fierce with
      rancour. "I shall go to this Valmond to-night, with my friend the member
      here. I shall warn him, and call upon the people to disperse. If he
      doesn't listen, let him beware! I seem to stand alone in the care of
      Pontiac!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The avocat turned to his desk. "No, no; I will write you a legal opinion,"
      he said, with professional honesty. "You shall have my legal help; but for
      the rest, I am at one with my dear Cure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Medallion, you too?" asked De la Riviere. "I'll go with you to the
      camp," answered the auctioneer. "Fair play is all I care for. Pontiac will
      come out of this all right. Come along."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the avocat kept them till he had written his legal opinion and had
      handed it courteously to the young Seigneur. They were all silent. There
      had been a discourtesy, and it lay like a cloud on the coterie. De la
      Riviere opened the door to go out, after bowing to the Cure and the
      avocat, who stood up with mannered politeness; but presently he turned,
      came back, was about to speak, when, catching sight of a miniature of
      Valmond on the avocat's desk, before which was set a bunch of violets, he
      wheeled and left the room without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon had not yet risen, but stars were shining, when the young
      Seigneur and the member came to Dalgrothe Mountain. On one side of the
      Rock of Red Pigeons was a precipice and wild water; on the other was a
      deep valley like a cup, and in the centre of this was a sort of plateau or
      gentle slope. Dalgrothe Mountain towered above. Upon this plateau Valmond
      had pitched his tents. There was water, there was good air, and for
      purposes of drill&mdash;or defence&mdash;it was excellent. The approaches
      were patrolled, so that no outside stragglers could reach either the Rock
      of Red Pigeons or the valley, or see what was going on below, without
      permission. Lagroin was everywhere, drilling, commanding, browbeating his
      recruits one minute, and praising them the next. Lajeunesse, Garotte, and
      Muroc were invaluable, each after his kind. Duclosse the mealman was
      sutler.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Seigneur and his companions were not challenged, and they passed
      on up to the Rock of Red Pigeons. Looking down, they had a perfect view of
      the encampment. The tents had come from lumber-camps, from river-driving
      gangs, and from private stores; there was some regular uniform, flags were
      flying everywhere, many fires were burning, the voice of Lagroin in
      command came up the valley loudly, and Valmond watched the drill and a
      march past. The fires lit up the sides of the valley and glorified the
      mountains beyond. In this inspiring air it was impossible to feel an
      accent of disaster or to hear the stealthy footfall of ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three journeyed down into the valley, then up onto the plateau, where
      they were challenged, allowed to pass, and came to where Valmond sat upon
      his horse. At sight of them, with a suspicion of the truth, he ordered
      Lagroin to march the men down the long plateau. They made a good figure
      filing past the three visitors, as the young Seigneur admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond got from his horse, and waited for them. He looked weary, and
      there were dark circles round his eyes, as though he had had an illness;
      but he stood erect and quiet. His uniform was that of a general of the
      Empire. It was rather dingy, yet it was of rich material, and he wore the
      ribbon of the Legion of Honour on his breast. His paleness was not of
      fear, for when his eyes met Monsieur De la Riviere's, there was in them
      waiting, inquiry&mdash;nothing more. He greeted them all politely, and
      Medallion warmly, shaking his hand twice; for he knew well that the gaunt
      auctioneer had only kindness in his heart; and they had exchanged humorous
      stories more than once&mdash;a friendly bond.
    </p>
    <p>
      He motioned towards his tent near by, but the young Seigneur declined.
      Valmond looked round, and ordered away a listening soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is business and imperative," said De la Riviere. Valmond bowed. "Isn't
      it time this burlesque was ended?" continued the challenger, waving a hand
      towards the encampment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My presence here is my reply," answered Valmond. "But how does it concern
      monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All that concerns Pontiac concerns me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And me; I am as good a citizen as you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are troubling our people. This is illegal&mdash;this bearing arms,
      these purposes of yours. It is mere filibustering, and you are an&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond waved his hand, as if to stop the word. "I am Valmond Napoleon,
      monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you do not promise to forego this, I will arrest you," said De la
      Riviere sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You?" Valmond smiled ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am a justice of the peace. I have the power."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have the power to prevent arrest, and I will prevent it, monsieur. You
      alone of all this parish, I believe of all this province, turn a sour
      face, a sour heart, to me. I regret it, but I do not fear it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will have you in custody, or there is no law in Quebec," was the acrid
      set-out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond's face was a feverish red now, and he made an impatient gesture.
      Both men had bitter hearts, for both knew well that the touchstone of this
      malice was Madame Chalice. Hatred looked out of their eyes. It was, each
      knew, a fight to the dark end.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is not law enough to justify you, monsieur," answered Valmond
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be persuaded, monsieur," urged the member to Valmond, with a persuasive,
      smirking gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All this country could not persuade me; only France can do that; and
      first I shall persuade France," he answered, speaking to his old cue
      stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mummer!" broke out De la Riviere. "By God, I will arrest you now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped forward, putting his hand in his breast, as if to draw a
      weapon, though, in truth, it was a summons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like lightning the dwarf shot in between, and a sword flashed up at De la
      Riviere's breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saved your father's life, but I will take yours, if you step farther,
      dear Seigneur," he said coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond had not stirred, but his face was pale again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will do, Parpon," he said quietly. "Monsieur had better go," he
      added to De la Riviere, "or even his beloved law may not save him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will put an end to this," cried the other, bursting with anger. "Come,
      gentlemen," he said to his companions, and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medallion paused, then came to Valmond and said: "Your Excellency, if ever
      you need me, let me know. I'd do much to prove myself no enemy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond gave him his hand courteously, bowed, and, beckoning a soldier to
      take his horse, walked towards his tent. He swayed slightly as he went,
      then a trembling seized him. He staggered as he entered the door of the
      tent, and Parpon, seeing, ran forward and caught him in his arms. The
      little man laid him down, felt his pulse, his heart, saw a little black
      stain on his lips, and cried out in a great fear:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My God! The black fever! Ah, my Napoleon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond lay in a burning stupor; and word went abroad that he might die;
      but Parpon insisted that he would be well presently, and at first would
      let no one but the Little Chemist and the Cure come in or near the tent.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sickness had come like a whirlwind: when it passed, what would be
      left? The fight went on in the quiet hills&mdash;a man of no great stature
      or strength, against a monster who racked him in a fierce embrace. A
      thousand scenes flashed through Valmond's brain, before his eyes, while
      the great wheel of torture went round, and he was broken, broken-mended
      and broken again, upon it. Spinning&mdash;he was for ever spinning, like a
      tireless moth through a fiery air; and the world went roaring past. In
      vain he cried to the wheelman to stop the wheel: there was no answer.
      Would those stars never cease blinking in and out, or the wind stop
      whipping the swift clouds past? So he went on, endless years, driving
      through space, some terrible intangible weight dragging at his heart, and
      all his body panting as it spun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grotesque faces came and went, and bright-eyed women floated by, laughing
      at him, beckoning to him; but he could not come, because of this endless
      going. He heard them singing, he felt the divine notes in his battered
      soul; he tried to weep for the hopeless joy of it; but the tears came no
      higher than his throat. Why did they mock him so? At last, all the figures
      merged into one, and she had the face&mdash;ah, he had seen it centuries
      ago!&mdash;of Madame Chalice. Strange that she was so young still, and
      that was so long past&mdash;when he stood on a mountain, and, clambering a
      high wall of rock, looked over into a happy No-man's Land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did the face elude him so, flashing in and out of the vapours? Why was
      its look sorrowful and distant? And yet there was that perfect smile, that
      adorable aspect of the brow, that light in the deep eyes. He tried to stop
      the eternal spinning, but it went remorselessly on; and presently the face
      was gone; but not till it had given him ease of his pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came fighting, fighting, nothing but fighting&mdash;endless charges
      of cavalry, continuous wheelings and advancings and retreatings, and the
      mad din of drums; afterwards, in a swift quiet, the deep, even thud of the
      horses' hoofs striking the ground. Flags and banners flaunted gaily by.
      How the helmets flashed, and the foam flew from the bits! But those flocks
      of blackbirds flying over the heads of the misty horsemen&mdash;they made
      him shiver. Battle, battle, battle, and death, and being born&mdash;he
      felt it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once there came a wide peace and clearing, and the everlasting jar
      and movement ceased. Then a great pause, and light streamed round him,
      comforting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him that he was lying helpless and still by falling water in
      a valley. The water soothed him, and he fell asleep. After a long time he
      waked, and dimly knew that a face, good to look at, was bending over him.
      In a vague, far-off way he saw that it was Elise Malboir; but even as he
      saw, his eyes closed, the world dropped away, and he sank to sleep again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no vision or delirium; for Elise had come. She had knelt beside his
      bed, and given him drink, and smoothed his pillow; and once, when no one
      was in the tent, she stooped and kissed his hot dark lips, and whispered
      words that were not for his ears to hear, nor to be heard by any one of
      this world. The good Cure found her there. He had not heart to bid her go
      home, and he made it clear to the villagers that he approved of her great
      kindness. But he bade her mother also come, and she stayed in a tent near
      by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lagroin and two hundred men held the encampment, and every night the
      recruits arrived from the village, drilled as before, and waited for the
      fell disease to pass. No one knew its exact nature, but now and again, in
      long years, some one going to Dalgrothe Mountain was seized by it, and
      died, or was left stricken with a great loss of the senses, or the limbs.
      Yet once or twice, they said, men had come up from it no worse at all.
      There was no known cure, and the Little Chemist could only watch the swift
      progress of the fever, and use simple remedies to allay the suffering.
      Parpon knew that the disease had seized upon Valmond the night of the
      burial of Gabriel. He remembered now the sickly, pungent air that floated
      past, and how Valmond, weak from the loss of blood in the fight at the
      smithy, shuddered, and drew his cloak about him. A few days would end it,
      for good or ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Chalice heard the news with consternation, and pity would have sent
      her to Valmond's bedside, but that she found Elise was his faithful nurse
      and servitor. This fixed in her mind the belief that if Valmond died, he
      would leave both misery and shame behind; if he lived, she should, in any
      case, see him no more. But she sent him wines and delicacies, and she also
      despatched a messenger to a city sixty miles away, for the best physician.
      Then she sought the avocat, to discover whether he had any exact
      information as to Valmond's friends in Quebec, or in France. She had
      promised not to be his enemy, and she remembered with a sort of sorrow
      that she had told him she meant to be his friend; but, having promised,
      she would help him in his sore strait.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had heard of De la Riviere's visit to Valmond, and she intended
      sending for him, but delayed it. The avocat told her nothing: matters were
      in abeyance, and she abided the issue; meanwhile getting news of the sick
      man twice a day. More, she used all her influence to keep up the feeling
      for him in the country, to prevent flagging of enthusiasm. This she did
      out of a large heart, and a kind of loyalty to her temperament and to his
      own ardour for his cause. Until he was proved the comedian (in spite of
      the young Seigneur) she would stand by him, so far as his public career
      was concerned. Misfortune could not make her turn from a man; it was then
      she gave him a helping hand. What was between him and Elise was for their
      own souls and consciences.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she passed the little cottage in the field the third morning of
      Valmond's illness, she saw the girl entering. Elise had come to get some
      necessaries for Valmond and for her mother. She was pale; her face had
      gained a spirituality, a refinement, new and touching. Madame Chalice was
      tempted to go and speak to her, and started to do so, but turned back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, not until we know the worst of this illness&mdash;then!" she said
      to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But ten minutes later De la Riviere was not so kind. He had guessed a
      little at Elise's secret, and as he passed the house on the way to visit
      Madame Chalice, seeing the girl, he came to the door and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "How goes it with the distinguished gentleman, Elise? I hear you are his
      slave."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned a little pale. She was passing a hot iron over some coarse
      sheets, and, pausing, she looked steadily at him and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not far to Dalgrothe Mountain, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The journey's too long for me; I haven't your hot young blood," he said
      suggestively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not so long a dozen years ago, monsieur." De la Riviere flushed to
      his hair. That memory was a hateful chapter in his life&mdash;a boyish
      folly, which involved the miller's wife. He had buried it, the village had
      forgotten it,&mdash;such of it as knew,&mdash;and the remembrance of it
      stung him. He had, however, brought it on himself, and he must eat the
      bitter fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl's eyes were cold and hard. She knew him to be Valmond's enemy,
      and she had no idea of sparing him. She knew also that he had been
      courteous enough to send a man each day to inquire after Valmond, but that
      was not to the point; he was torturing her, he had prophesied the downfall
      of her "spurious Napoleon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be too long a journey for you, and for all, presently," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean that His Excellency will die?" she asked, her heart beating so
      hard that it hurt her. Yet the flat-iron moved backwards and forwards upon
      the sheets mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or fight a Government," he answered. "He has had a good time, and good
      times can't last for ever, can they, Elise? Have you ever thought of
      that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned pale and swayed over the table. In an instant he was beside
      her; for though he had been irritable and ungenerous, he had at bottom a
      kind heart. Catching up a glass of water, he ran an arm round her waist
      and held the cup to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter, my girl?" he asked. "There, pull yourself together."
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew away from him, though grateful for his new attitude. She could
      not bear everything. She felt nervous and strangely weak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't you go, monsieur?" she said, and turned to her ironing again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her closely, and not unkindly. For a moment the thought
      possessed him that evil and ill had come to her. But he put it away from
      him, for there was that in her eyes which gave his quick suspicions the
      lie. He guessed now that the girl loved Valmond, and he left her with that
      thought. Going up the hill, deep in thought, he called at the Manor, to
      find that Madame Chalice was absent, and would not be back till evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Elise was left alone, a weakness seized her again, as it had done
      when De la Riviere was present. She had had no sleep in four days, and it
      was wearing on her, she said to herself, refusing to believe that a
      sickness was coming. Leaving the kitchen, she went up to her bedroom.
      Opening the window, she sat down on the side of the bed and looked round.
      She figured Valmond in her mind as he stood in this place and that, his
      voice, his words to her, the look in his face, the clasp of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once she sprang up, fell on her knees before the little shrine of
      the Virgin, and burst into tears. Her rich hair, breaking loose, flowed
      round her-the picture of a Magdalen; but it was, in truth, a pure girl
      with a true heart. At last she calmed herself and began to pray:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, dear Mother of God, thou who dost speak for the sorrowful before thy
      Son and the Father, be merciful to me and hear me. I am but a poor girl,
      and my life is no matter. But he is a great man, and he has work to do,
      and he is true and kind. Oh, pray for him, divine Mother, sweet Mary, that
      he may be saved from death! If the cup must be emptied, may it be given to
      me to drink! Oh, see how all the people come to him and love him! For the
      saving of Madelinette, oh, may his own life be given him! He cannot pray
      for himself, but I pray for him. Dear Mother of God, I love him, and I
      would lose my life for his sake. Sweet Mary, comfort thy child, and out of
      thy own sorrow be good to my sorrow. Hear me and pray for me, divine Mary.
      Amen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her whole nature had been emptied out, and there came upon her a calm, a
      strange clearness of brain, exhausted in body as she was. For an instant
      she stood thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame Degardy! Madame Degardy!" she cried, with sudden inspiration. "Ah,
      I will find her; she may save him with her herbs!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurried out of the house and down through the village to the little
      hut by the river, where the old woman lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elise had been to Madame Degardy as good a friend as a half-mad creature,
      with no memory, would permit her. Parpon had lived for years in the same
      village, but, though he was her own son, she had never given him a look of
      recognition, had used him as she used all others. In turn, the dwarf had
      never told any one but Valmond of the relationship; and so the two lived
      their strange lives in their own singular way. But the Cure knew who it
      was that kept the old woman's house supplied with wood and other
      necessaries. Parpon himself had tried to summon her to Valmond's bedside,
      for he knew well her skill with herbs, but the little hut was empty, and
      he could get no trace of her. She had disappeared the night Valmond was
      seized of the fever, and she came back to her little home in the very hour
      that Elise visited her. The girl found her boiling herbs before a big
      fire. She was stirring the pot diligently, now and then sprinkling in what
      looked like a brown dust, and watching the brew intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, but did not look at Elise, and said crossly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in, come in, and shut the door, silly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame," said the girl, "His Excellency has the black fever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What of that?" she returned irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought maybe your herbs could cure him. You've cured others, and this
      is an awful sickness. Ah, won't you save him, if you can?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you to him, pale-face?" she said, her eyes peering into the pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing more to him than you are, madame," the girl answered wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll cure because I want, not because you ask me, pretty brat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elise's heart gave a leap: these very herbs were for Valmond! The old
      woman had travelled far to get the medicaments immediately she had heard
      of Valmond's illness. Night and day she had trudged, and she was more
      brown and weather-beaten than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The black fever! the black fever!" cried the old woman. "I know it well.
      It's most like a plague. I know it. But I know the cure-ha, ha! Come along
      now, feather-legs, what are you staring there for? Hold that jug while I
      pour the darling liquor in. Ha, ha! Crazy Joan hasn't lived for nothing.
      They have to come to her; the great folks have to come to her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So she meandered on, filling the jug. Later, in the warm dusk, they
      travelled up to Dalgrothe Mountain, and came to Valmond's tent. By the
      couch knelt Parpon, watching the laboured breathing of the sick man. When
      he saw Madame Degardy, he gave a growl of joy, and made way for her. She
      pushed him back with her stick contemptuously, looked Valmond over, ran
      her fingers down his cheek, felt his throat, and at last held his restless
      hand. Elise, with the quick intelligence of love, stood ready. The old
      woman caught the jug from her, swung it into the hollow of her arm, poured
      the cup half full, and motioned the girl to lift up Valmond's head. Elise
      raised it to her bosom, leaning her face down close to his. Madame Degardy
      instantly pushed back her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't get his breath&mdash;that's death, idiot!" she said, and began to
      pour the liquid into Valmond's mouth very slowly. It was a tedious process
      at first, but at length he began to swallow naturally, and finished the
      cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no change for an hour, and then he became less restless. After
      another cupful, his eyes half opened. Within an hour a perspiration came,
      and he was very quiet, and sleeping easily. Parpon crouched near the door,
      watching it all with deep, piercing eyes. Madame Degardy never moved from
      her place, but stood shaking her head and muttering. At last Lagroin came,
      and whisperingly asked after his chief; then, seeing him in a healthy and
      peaceful sleep, he stooped and kissed the hand lying upon the blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beloved sire! Thank the good God!" he said. Soon after he had gone, there
      was a noise of tramping about the tent, and then a suppressed cheer, which
      was fiercely stopped by Parpon, and the soldiers of the Household Troops
      scattered to their tents.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?" asked Valmond, opening his eyes bewilderedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your soldiers, sire," answered the dwarf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond smiled languidly. Then he saw Madame Degardy and Elise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very sleepy, dear friends," he said, with a courteous, apologetic
      gesture, and closed his eyes. Presently they opened again. "My snuff-box&mdash;in
      my pocket," he said to the old woman, waving a hand to where his uniform
      hung from the tent-pole; "it is for you, madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      She understood, smiled grimly, felt in a waistcoat pocket, found the
      snuff-box, and, squatting on the ground like a tailor, she took two
      pinches, and sat holding the antique silver box in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Crazy Joan's no fool, dear lad," she said at last, and took another
      pinch, and knowingly nodded her head again and again, while he slept
      soundly.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      "Lights Out!"
    </h3>
    <p>
      The bugle-call rang softly down the valley, echoed away tenderly in the
      hills, and was lost in the distance. Roused by the clear call, Elise rose
      from watching beside Valmond's couch, and turned towards the door of the
      tent. The spring of a perfect joy at his safety had been followed by an
      aching in all her body and a trouble at her heart. Her feet were like
      lead, her spirit quivered and shrank by turn. The light of the campfires
      sent a glow through the open doorway upon the face of the sleeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned over him. The look she gave him seemed to her anxious spirit
      like a farewell. This man had given her a new life, and out of it had come
      a new sight. Valmond had escaped death, but in her poor confused way she
      felt another storm gathering about him. A hundred feelings possessed her;
      but one thought was master of them all: when trouble drew round him, she
      must be near him, must be strong to help him, protect him, if need be. Yet
      a terrible physical weakness was on her. Her limbs trembled, her head
      ached, her heart throbbed in a sickening way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stirred in his sleep; a smile passed over his face. She wondered what
      gave it birth. She knew well it was not for her, that smile. It belonged
      to his dream of success&mdash;when a thousand banners should flaunt in the
      gardens of the Tuileries. Overcome by a sudden rush of emotion, she fell
      on her knees at his side, bursting into noiseless sobs, which shook her
      from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every nerve in her body responded to the shock of feeling; she was having
      her dark hour alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she staggered to her feet and turned to the open door. The tents
      lay silent in the moonshine, but wayward lights flickered in the sumptuous
      dusk, and the quiet of the hills hung like a canopy over the bivouac of
      the little army. No token of misfortune came out of this peaceful
      encampment, no omen of disaster crossed the long lane of drowsy fires and
      huge amorous shadows. The sense of doom was in the girl's own heart, not
      in this deep cradle of the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and again a sentinel crossed the misty line of vision, silent, and
      majestically tall, in the soft haze, which came down from Dalgrothe
      Mountain and fell like a delicate silver veil before the face of the
      valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she looked, lost in a kind of dream, there floated up from the distant
      tent the refrain she knew so well:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "Oh, say, where goes your love?
             O gai, vine le roi!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Her hand caught her bosom as if to stifle a sudden pain. That song had
      been the keynote to her new life, and it seemed now as if it were also to
      be the final benediction. All her spirit gathered itself up for a great
      resolution: she would not yield to this invading weakness, this misery of
      body and mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one drew out of the shadows and came towards her. It was Madame
      Degardy. She had seen the sobbing figure inside the tent, but, with the
      occasional wisdom of the foolish of this world, she had not been less
      considerate than the children of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      With brusque, kindly taps of her stick, she drove the girl to her own
      tent, and bade her sleep: but sleep was not for Elise that night; and in
      the grey dawn, while yet no one was stirring in the camp, she passed
      slowly down the valley to her home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Chalice was greatly troubled also. Valmond's life was saved. In
      three days he was on his feet, eager and ardent again, and preparing to go
      to the village; but what would the end of it all be? She knew of De la
      Riviere's intentions, and she foresaw a crisis. If Valmond were in very
      truth a Napoleon, all might be well, though this crusade must close here.
      If he were an impostor, things would go cruelly hard with him. Impostor?
      Strange how, in spite of all evidence against him, she still felt a vital
      sureness in him somewhere; a radical reality, a convincing quality of
      presence. At times he seemed like an actor playing his own character. She
      could never quite get rid of that feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her anxiety&mdash;for she was in the affair for good or ill&mdash;she
      went again to Monsieur Garon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You believe in Monsieur Valmond, dear avocat?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man looked at her admiringly, though his admiration was a
      quaint, Arcadian thing; and, perching his head on one side abstractedly,
      he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes, ah, yes! Such candour! He is the son of Napoleon and a certain
      princess, born after Napoleon's fall, not long before his death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, of course, Monsieur Valmond is really nameless?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, there is the point&mdash;the only point; but His Excellency can clear
      up all that, and will do so in good time, he says. He maintains that
      France will accept him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the Government here, will they put him down? proceed against him? Can
      they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes, I fear they can proceed against him. He may recruit men, but he
      may not drill and conspire, you see. Yet"&mdash;the old man smiled, as
      though at some distant and pleasing prospect "the cause is a great one; it
      is great. Ah, madame, dear madame"&mdash;he got to his feet and stepped
      into the middle of the floor&mdash;"he has the true Napoleonic spirit. He
      loves it all. At the very first, it seemed as if he were going to be a
      little ridiculous; now it is as if there was but one thing for him&mdash;love
      of France and loyalty to the cause. Ah, think of the glories of the
      Empire! of France as the light of Europe, of Napoleon making her rich and
      proud and dominant! And think of her now, sinking into the wallow of
      bourgeois vulgarity! If&mdash;if, as His Excellency said, the light were
      to come from here, even from this far corner of the world, from this old
      France, to be the torch of freedom once again&mdash;from our little parish
      here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His face was glowing, his thin hands made a quick gesture of charmed
      anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Chalice looked at him in a sort of wonder and delight. Dreamers
      all! And this visionary Napoleon had come into the little man's quiet,
      cultured, passive life, and had transformed him, filled him with adventure
      and patriotism. There must be something behind Valmond, some real, even
      some great thing, or this were not possible. It was not surprising that
      she, with the spirit of dreams and romance deep in her, should be
      sympathetic, even carried away for the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is the feeling in the country since his illness?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never so strong as now. Many new recruits come to him. Organisation goes
      on, and His Excellency has issued a proclamation. I have advised him
      against that&mdash;it is not necessary, it is illegal. He should not tempt
      our Government too far. But he is a gentleman of as great simplicity as
      courage, of directness and virtue&mdash;a wholesome soldier&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought again of that moonlit night, and Elise's window, and a kind of
      hatred of the man came up in her. No, no, she was wrong; he was not the
      true thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear avocat," she said suddenly, "you are a good friend. May I have
      always as good! But have you ever thought that this thing may end in sore
      disaster? Are we doing right? Is the man worthy our friendship and our
      adherence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, dear madame, convictions, principles, truth, they lead to good ends&mdash;somewhere.
      I have a letter here from Monsieur Valmond. It breathes noble things; it
      has humour, too&mdash;ah, yes, so quaint! I am to see him this afternoon&mdash;he
      returns to the Louis Quinze to-day. The Cure and I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid her hand on his arm, interrupting him. "Will you take me this
      evening to Monsieur Valmond, dear friend?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw now how useless it was to attempt anything through these admirers
      of Valmond; she must do it herself. He must be firmly and finally warned
      and dissuaded. The conviction had suddenly come to her with great force,
      that the end was near&mdash;come to her as it came to Elise. Her wise mind
      had seen the sure end; Elise's heart had felt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The avocat readily promised. She was to call for him at a little before
      eight o'clock. But she decided that she would first seek Elise; before she
      accused the man, she would question the woman. Above and beyond all anger
      she felt at this miserable episode, there was pity in her heart for the
      lonely girl. She was capable of fierce tempers, of great caprices, of even
      wild injustice, when her emotions had their way with her; but her heart
      was large, her nature deep and broad, and her instincts kind. The little
      touch of barbarism in her gave her, too, a sense of primitive justice. She
      was self-analytical, critical of life and conduct, yet her mind and her
      heart, when put to the great test, were above mere anatomising. Her rich
      nature, alive with these momentous events, feeling the prescience of
      coming crisis, sent a fine glow into her face, into her eyes. Excitement
      gave a fresh elasticity to her step.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of her serious thoughts, she looked very young, almost
      irresponsible. No ordinary observer could guess the mind that lay behind
      the eloquent, glowing eyes. Even the tongue at first deceived, till it
      began to probe, to challenge, to drop sharp, incisive truths in little
      gold-leaped pellets, which brought conviction when the gold-leaf wore off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sunlight made her part of the brilliant landscape, and she floated
      into it, neither too dainty nor too luxurious. The greatest heat of the
      day was past, and she was walking slowly under the maples, on the way to
      Elise's home, when she was arrested by a voice near her. Then a tall
      figure leaped the fence, and came to her with outstretched hand and an
      unmistakable smile of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've called at the Manor twice, and found you out; so I took to the
      highway," said the voice gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Seigneur," she answered, with mock gravity, "ancestors' habits
      show in time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, that's severe, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have waylaid me in a lonely place, master highwayman!" she said, with
      a torturing sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never seen her so radiantly debonnaire; yet her heart was full of
      annoying anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's so much I want to say to you," he answered more seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So very much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very much indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up the road. "I can give you ten minutes," she said. "Suppose
      we walk up and down under these trees. It is shady and quiet here. Now
      proceed, monsieur. Is it my money or my life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are in a charming mood to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which is more than I could say for you the last time we met. You
      threatened, stormed, were childish, impossible to a degree."
    </p>
    <p>
      His face became grave. "We were such good friends once!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once&mdash;once?" she asked maliciously. "Once Cain and Abel were a happy
      family. When was that once?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two years ago. What talks we had then! I had so looked forward to your
      coming again. It was the alluring thing in my life, your arrival," he went
      on; "but something came between."
    </p>
    <p>
      His tone nettled her. He talked as if he had some distant claim on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something came between?" she repeated slowly, mockingly. "That sounds
      melodramatic indeed. What was it came between&mdash;a coach-and-four, or a
      grand army?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing so stately," he answered, piqued by her tone: "a filibuster and
      his ragamuffins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ragamufins would be appreciated by Monsieur Valmond's followers, spoken
      at the four corners," she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I'll change it," he said: "a ragamuffin and his filibusters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The 'ragamuffin' always speaks of his enemies with courtesy, and the
      filibusters love their leader," was her pointed rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At half a dollar a day," he answered sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They get that much from His Excellency, do they?" she asked in real
      surprise. "That doesn't look like filibustering, does it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'His Excellency!'" he retorted. "Why won't you look this matter straight
      in the face? Napoleon or no Napoleon, the end of this thing is ruin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care that you don't get lost in the debris," she said bitingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can take care of myself. I am sorry to have you mixed up in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are sorry? How good of you! How paternal!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If your husband were here&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If my husband were here, you would probably be his best friend," she
      rejoined, with acid sweetness; "and I should still have to take care of
      myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he no sense of what was possible to leave unsaid to a woman? She was
      very angry, though she was also a little sorry for him; for perhaps in the
      long run he would be in the right. But he must pay for his present
      stupidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wrong me," he answered, with a quick burst of feeling. "You are most
      unfair. You punish me because I do my public duty; and because I would do
      anything in the world for you, you punish me the more. Have you forgotten
      two years ago? Is it so easy to your hand, a true and constant admiration,
      a sincere homage, that you throw it aside like&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur De la Riviere," she said, with exasperating deliberation, her
      eyes having a dangerous light, "your ten minutes is more than up. And it
      has been quite ten minutes too long."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I were a filibuster"&mdash;he answered bitterly and suggestively.
    </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted him, saying, with a purring softness: "If you had only
      courage enough&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hand angrily. "If I had, I should hope you would prove a
      better friend to me than you are to this man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, in what way do I fail towards 'this man'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By encouraging his downfall. See&mdash;I know I am taking my life in my
      hands, as it were, but I tell you this thing will do you harm when it goes
      abroad."
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt the honesty of his words, though they angered her. He seemed to
      impute some personal interest in Valmond. She would not have it from any
      man in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will pick up my handkerchief&mdash;ah, thank you! We must travel
      different roads in this matter. You have warned; let me prophesy. His
      Highness Valmond Napoleon will come out of this with more honour than
      yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks to you, then," he said gallantly, for he admired her very
      stubbornness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks to himself. I honestly believe that you will be ashamed of your
      part in this, one day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In any case, I will force the matter to a conclusion," he answered
      firmly. "The fantastic thing must end."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Within a few days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When all is over, perhaps you will have the honesty to come and tell me
      which was right&mdash;you or I. Goodbye."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elise was busy at her kitchen fire. She looked up, startled, as her
      visitor entered. Her heavy brow grew heavier, her eyes gleamed sulkily, as
      she dragged herself forward with weariness, and stood silent and
      resentful. Why had this lady of the Manor come to her? Madame Chalice
      scarcely knew how to begin, for, in truth, she wanted to be the girl's
      friend, and she feared making her do or say some wild thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked round the quiet room. Some fruit was boiling on a stove, giving
      out a fragrant savour, and Elise's eye was on it mechanically. A bit of
      sewing lay across a chair, and on the wall hung a military suit of the old
      sergeant, beside it a short sabre. An old Tricolor was draped from a beam,
      and one or two maps of France were pinned on the wall. She fastened her
      look on the maps. They seemed to be her cue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you any influence with your uncle?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elise remained gloomily silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because," Madame Chalice went on smoothly, ignoring her silence, "I think
      it would be better for him to go back to Ville Bambord&mdash;I am sure of
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl's lip curled angrily. What right had this great lady to interfere
      with her or hers? What did she mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      "My uncle is a general and a brave man; he can take care of himself," she
      answered defiantly. Madame Chalice did not smile at the title. She admired
      the girl's courage. She persisted however. "He is one man, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has plenty of men, madame, and His Excellency&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His Excellency and hundreds of men cannot stand, if the Government send
      soldiers against them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should the Gover'ment do that? They're only going to France; they
      mean no trouble here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They have no right to drill and conspire here, my girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my uncle and his men will fight; we'll all fight," Elise retorted,
      her hands grasping the arms of the rocking-chair she sat in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why shouldn't we avoid fighting? What is there to fight for? You are
      all very happy here. You were very happy here before Monsieur Valmond
      came. Are you happy now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Chalice's eyes searched the flushed face anxiously. She was growing
      more eager every moment to serve, if she could, this splendid creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We would die for him!" answered the girl quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would die for him," came the reply, slowly, meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what's it to you, if I would?" came the sharp retort. "Why do you
      fine folk meddle yourselves with poor folk's affairs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, remembering she was a hostess, with the instinctive courtesy of her
      race, she said: "Ah, pardon, madame; you meant nothing, I'm sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should fine folk make poor folk unhappy?" said Madame Chalice,
      quietly and sorrowfully, for she saw that Elise was suffering, and all the
      woman in her came to her heart and lips. She laid her hand on the girl's
      arm. "Indeed yes, why should fine folk make poor folk unhappy? It is not I
      alone who makes you unhappy, Elise."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl angrily shook off the hand, for she read the true significance of
      the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you trying to find out?" she asked fiercely. "What do you want
      to do? Did I ever come in your way? Why do you come into mine? What's my
      life to you? Nothing, nothing at all. You're here to-day and away
      to-morrow. You're English; you're not of us. Can't you see that I want to
      be left alone?
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I were unhappy, I could look after myself. But I'm not, I'm not&mdash;I
      tell you I'm not! I'm happy. I never knew what happiness was till now. I'm
      so happy that I can stand here and not insult you, though you've insulted
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I meant no insult, Elise. I want to help you; that is all. I know how
      hard it is to confide in one's kinsfolk, and I wish with all my heart I
      might be your friend, if you ever need me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elise met her sympathetic look clearly and steadily. "Speak plain to me,
      madame," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Elise, I saw some one climb out of your bedroom window," was the slow
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my God!" said the girl; "oh, my God!" and she stared blankly for a
      moment at Madame Chalice. Then, trembling greatly, she reached to the
      table for a cup of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Chalice was at once by her side. "You are ill, poor girl," she said
      anxiously, and put her arm around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elise drew away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you all, madame, all; and you must believe it, for, as God is
      my judge, it is the truth." Then she told the whole story, exactly as it
      happened, save mention of the kisses that Valmond had given her. Her eyes
      now and again filled with tears, and she tried, in her poor untutored way,
      to set him right. She spoke for him altogether, not for herself; and her
      listener saw that the bond which held the girl to the man might be
      proclaimed in the streets, with no dishonour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the story, and that's the truth," said Elise at last. "He's a
      gentleman, a great man, and I'm a poor girl, and there can be nothing
      between us; but I'd die for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      She no longer resented Madame Chalice's solicitude: she was passive, and
      showed that she wished to be alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think there's going to be great trouble?" she asked, as Madame
      Chalice made ready to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear so, but we will do all we can to prevent it." Elise watched her go
      on towards the Manor in the declining sunlight, then turned heavily to her
      work again.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came to her ears the sound of a dog-churn in the yard outside, and
      the dull roll and beat seemed to keep time to the aching pulses in her
      head, in all her body. One thought kept going through her brain: there
      was, as she had felt, trouble coming for Valmond. She had the conviction,
      too, that it was very near. Her one definite idea was, that she should be
      able to go to him when that trouble came; that she should not fail him at
      his great need. Yet these pains in her body, this alternate exaltation and
      depression, this pitiful weakness! She must conquer it. She remembered the
      hours spent at his bedside; the moments when he was all hers&mdash;by
      virtue of his danger and her own unwavering care of him. She recalled the
      dark moment when Death, intrusive, imminent, lurked at the tent door, and
      in its shadow she emptied out her soul in that one kiss of fealty and
      farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      That kiss&mdash;there came to her again, suddenly, Madame Degardy's cry of
      warning: "Don't get his breath&mdash;it's death, idiot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was it: the black fever was in her veins! That one kiss had sealed
      her own doom. She knew it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had given her life by giving her love. Well, he should give her death
      too&mdash;her lord of fife and death. She was of the chosen few who could
      drink the cup of light and the cup of darkness with equally regnant soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it might lay her low in the very hour of Valmond's trouble. She must
      conquer it&mdash;how? To whom could she turn for succour? There was but
      one,&mdash;yet she could not seek Madame Degardy, for the old woman would
      drive her to her bed, and keep her there. There was only this to do: to
      possess herself of those wonderful herbs which had been given her Napoleon
      in his hour of peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dragging herself wearily to the little but by the river, she knocked, and
      waited. All was still, and, opening the door, she entered. Striking a
      match, she found a candle, lighted it, and then began her search. Under an
      old pan on a shelf she found both herbs and powder. She snatched up a
      handful of the herbs, and kissed them with joyful heart. Saved&mdash;she
      was saved! Ah, thank the Blessed Virgin! She would thank her for ever!
    </p>
    <p>
      A horrible sinking sensation seized her. Turning in dismay, she saw the
      face of Parpon at the window. With a blind instinct for protection, she
      staggered towards the door, and fell, her fingers still clasping the
      precious herbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Parpon hastily entered, Madame Degardy hobbled out of the shadow of the
      trees, and furtively watched the hut. When a light appeared, she crept to
      the door, opened it stealthily upon the intruders of her home, and stepped
      inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parpon was kneeling by Elise, lifting up her head, and looking at her in
      horrified distress.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a shrill cry the old woman came forward and dropped on her knees at
      the other side of Elise. Her hand, fumbling anxiously over the girl's
      breast, met the hard and warty palm of the dwarf. She stopped suddenly,
      raised the sputtering candle, and peered into his eyes with a vague,
      wavering intensity. For minutes they knelt there, the silence clothing
      them about, the body of the unconscious girl between them. A lost memory
      was feeling blindly its way home again. By and by, out of an infinite
      past, something struggled to the old woman's eyes, and Parpon's heart
      almost burst in his anxiety. At length her look steadied. Memory,
      recognition, showed in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a wild cry her gaunt arms stretched across, and caught the great head
      to her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where have you been so long, Parpon&mdash;my son?" she said.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Valmond's strength came back quickly, but something had given his mind a
      new colour. He felt, by a strange telegraphy of fate, that he had been
      spared death by fever to meet an end more in keeping with the strange
      exploit which now was coming to a crisis. The next day he was going back
      to Dalgrothe Mountain, the day after that there should be final review,
      and the succeeding day the march to the sea would begin. A move must be
      made. There could be no more delay. He had so lost himself in the dream,
      that it had become real, and he himself was the splendid adventurer, the
      maker of empires. True, he had only a small band of ill-armed men, but
      better arms could be got, and by the time they reached the sea&mdash;who
      could tell!
    </p>
    <p>
      As he sat alone in the quiet dusk of his room at the Louis Quinze waiting
      for Parpon, there came a tap at his door. It opened, the garcon mumbled
      something, and Madame Chalice entered slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her look had no particular sympathy, but there was a sort of friendliness
      in the rich colour of her face, in the brightness of her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The avocat was to have accompanied me," she said; "but at the last I
      thought it better to come without him, because&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused. "Yes, madame&mdash;because?" he asked, offering her a chair.
      He was dressed in simple black, as on that first day when he called at the
      Manor, and it set off the ivory paleness of his complexion, making his
      face delicate yet strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked round the room, almost casually, before she went on
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because what I have to say were better said to you alone&mdash;much
      better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure you are right," he answered, as though he trusted her judgment
      utterly; and truly there was always something boy-like in his attitude
      towards her. The compliment was unstudied and pleasant, but she steeled
      herself for her task. She knew instinctively that she had influence with
      him, and she meant to use it to its utmost limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad, we are all glad, you are better," she said cordially; then
      added, "how do your affairs come on? What are your plans?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond forgot that she was his inquisitor; he only saw her as his ally,
      his friend. So he spoke to her, as he had done at the Manor, with a sort
      of eloquence, of his great theme. He had changed greatly. The rhetorical,
      the bizarre, had left his speech. There was no more grandiloquence than
      might be expected of a soldier who saw things in the bright flashes of the
      battle-field&mdash;sharp pinges of colour, the dyes well soaked in. He had
      the gift of telling a story: some peculiar timbre in the voice, some
      direct dramatic touch. She listened quietly, impressed and curious. The
      impossibilities seemed for a moment to vanish in the big dream, and she
      herself was a dreamer, a born adventurer among the wonders of life. Were
      she a man, she would have been an explorer or a soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      But good judgment returned, and she gathered herself together for the
      unpleasant task that lay before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked him steadily in the eyes. "I have come to tell you that you
      must give up this dream," she said slowly. "It can come to nothing but
      ill; and in the mishap you may be hurt past repair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall never give up&mdash;this dream," he said, surprised, but firm,
      almost dominant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think of these poor folk who surround you, who follow you. Would you see
      harm come to them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As soldiers, they will fight for a cause."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is&mdash;the cause?" she asked meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "France," was the quiet reply; and there was a strong ring in the tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so&mdash;you, monsieur!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You called me 'sire' once," he said tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I called my maid a fool yesterday, under some fleeting influence; one has
      moods," she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you would call me puppet to-morrow, we might strike a balance and find&mdash;what
      should we find?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An adventurer, I fear," she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not taken aback. "An adventurer truly," he said. "It is a far
      travel to France, and there is much to overcome!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She could scarcely reconcile this acute, self-contained man with the
      enthusiast and comedian she had seen in the Cure's garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur Valmond," she said, "I neither suspect nor accuse; I only feel.
      There is something terribly uncertain in this cause of yours, in your
      claims. You have no right to waste lives."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To waste lives?" he asked mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; the Government is to proceed against you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes," he answered. "Monsieur De la Riviere has seen to that; but he
      must pay for his interference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is beside the point. If a force comes against you&mdash;what then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I will act as becomes a Napoleon," he answered, rather grandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      So there was a touch of the bombastic in his manner even yet! She laughed
      a little ironically. Then all at once her thoughts reverted to Elise, and
      some latent cruelty in her awoke. Though she believed the girl, she would
      accuse the man, the more so, because she suddenly became aware that his
      eyes were fixed on herself in ardent admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might not have a convenient window," she said, with deliberate,
      consuming suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      His glance never wavered, though he understood instantly what she meant.
      Well, she had discovered that! He flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame," he said, "I hope that I am a gentleman at heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole scene came back on him, and a moisture sprang to his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is innocent," he continued&mdash;"upon my sacred honour! Yes, yes, I
      know that the evidence is all against me, but I speak the absolute truth.
      You saw&mdash;that night, did you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, it is a pity&mdash;a pity. But, madame, as you are a true woman,
      believe what I say; for, I repeat, it is the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with admirable reticence, even great delicacy, he told the story as
      Elise had told it, and as convincingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you, monsieur," she said frankly, when he had done, and
      stretched out her hand to him with a sudden impulse of regard. "Now,
      follow up that unselfishness by another."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked inquiringly at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give up this mad chase," she added eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!" was his instant reply. "Never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg of you, I appeal to you-my friend," she urged, with that ardour of
      the counsel who pleads a bad cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not impeach you or your claims, but I ask that you leave this
      village as you found it, these happy people undisturbed in their homes.
      Ah, go! Go now, and you will be a name to them, remembered always with
      admiration. You have been courageous, you have been loved, you have been
      inspiring&mdash;ah, yes, I admit it, even to me!&mdash;inspiring! The
      spirit of adventure in you, your hopes, your plans to do great things,
      roused me. It was that made me your ally more than aught else. Truly and
      frankly, I do not think that I am convinced of anything save that you are
      no coward, and that you love a cause. Let it go at that&mdash;you must,
      you must. You came in the night, privately and mysteriously; go in the
      night, this night, mysteriously&mdash;an inscrutable, romantic figure. If
      you are all you say, and I should be glad to think so,&mdash;go where your
      talents will have greater play, your claims larger recognition. This is a
      small game here. Leave us as you found us. We shall be the better for it;
      our poor folk here will be the better. Proceed with this, and who can tell
      what may happen? I was wrong, wrong&mdash;I see that now-to have
      encouraged you at all. I repent of it. Here, as I talk to you, I feel,
      with no doubt whatever, that the end of your bold exploit is near. Can you
      not see that? Ah yes, you must, you must! Take my horses to-night, leave
      here, and come back no more; and so none of us shall feel sorrow in
      thinking of the time when Valmond came to Pontiac."
    </p>
    <p>
      Variable, accusing, she had suddenly shown him something beyond caprice,
      beyond accident of mood or temper. The true woman had spoken; all outer
      modish garments had dropped away from her real nature, and showed its
      abundant depth and sincerity. All that was roused in him this moment was
      never known; he never could tell it; there were eternal spaces between
      them. She had been speaking to him just now with no personal sentiment.
      She was only the lover of honest things, the friend, the good ally,
      obliged to flee a cause for its terrible unsoundness, yet trying to
      prevent wreck and ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He arose and turned his head away for an instant, her eloquence had been
      so moving. His glance caught the picture of the Great Napoleon, and his
      eyes met hers again with new resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must stay," he answered; "I will not turn back, whatever comes. This is
      but child's play, but a speck beside what I mean to do. True, I came in
      the dark, but I will go in the light. I shall not leave them behind, these
      poor folk; they shall come with me. I have money, France is waiting, the
      people are sick of the Orleans, and I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you must, you must listen to me, monsieur!" she said desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came close to him, and, out of the frank eagerness of her nature, laid
      her hand upon his arm, and looked him in the eyes with an almost tender
      appealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the door opened, and Monsieur De la Riviere was announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, madame!" said the young Seigneur in a tone more than a little
      carbolic; "secrets of State, no doubt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Statesmen need not commit themselves to newsmongers, monsieur," she
      answered, still standing very near Valmond, as though she would continue a
      familiar talk when the disagreeable interruption had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was thoroughly fearless, clear of heart, above all littlenesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had come to warn Monsieur Valmond once again, but I find him with his
      ally, counsellor&mdash;and comforter," he retorted, with perilous
      suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time would move on, and Madame Chalice might forget that wild remark, but
      she never would forgive it, and she never wished to do so. The insolent,
      petty, provincial Seigneur!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur De la Riviere," she returned, with cold dignity, "you cannot
      live long enough to atone for that impertinence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, madame," he returned earnestly, awed by the look in
      her face; for she was thoroughly aroused. "I came to stop a filibustering
      expedition, to save the credit of the place where I was born, where my
      people have lived for generations."
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a quick, deprecatory gesture. "You saw me enter here," she said,
      "and you thought to discover treason of some kind&mdash;Heaven knows what
      a mind like yours may imagine! You find me giving better counsel to His
      Highness than you could ever hope to give&mdash;out of a better heart and
      from a better understanding. You have been worse than intrusive; you have
      been rash and stupid. You call His Highness filibuster and impostor. I
      assure you it is my fondest hope that Prince Valmond Napoleon will ever
      count me among his friends, in spite of all his enemies."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her shoulder on him, and took Valmond's hand with a pronounced
      obeisance, saying, "Adieu, sire" (she was never sorry she had said it),
      and passed from the room. Valmond was about to follow her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, no; I will go to my carriage alone," she said, and he did not
      insist.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had gone he stood holding the door open, and looking at De la
      Riviere. He was very pale; there was a menacing fire in his eyes. The
      young Seigneur was ready for battle also.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am occupied, monsieur," said Valmond meaningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have come to warn you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The old song; I am occupied, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charlatan!" said De la Riviere, and took a step angrily towards him, for
      he was losing command of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Parpon, who had been outside in the hall for a half-hour or
      more, stepped into the room, edged between the two, and looked up with a
      wicked, mocking leer at the young Seigneur.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have twenty-four hours to leave Pontiac," cried De la Riviere, as he
      left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My watch keeps different time, monsieur," said Valmond coolly, and closed
      the door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      From the depths where Elise was cast, it was not for her to see that her
      disaster had brought light to others; that out of the pitiful confusion of
      her life had come order and joy. A half-mad woman, without memory, knew
      again whence she came and whither she was going; and bewildered and happy,
      with a hungering tenderness, moved her hand over the head of her poor
      dwarf, as though she would know if he were truly her own son. A new spirit
      also had come into Parpon's eyes, gentler, less weird, less distant. With
      the advent of their joy a great yearning came to save Elise. They hung
      watchful, solicitous, over her bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must go hard with her, and twenty-four hours would see the end or a
      fresh beginning. She had fought back the fever too long, her brain and
      emotions had been strung to a fatal pitch, and the disease, like a
      hurricane, carried her on for hours, tearing at her being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her own mother sat in a corner, stricken and numb. At last she fell asleep
      in her chair, but Parpon and his mother slept not at all. Now and again
      the dwarf went to the door and looked out at the night, so still, and full
      of the wonder of growth and rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far up on Dalgrothe Mountain a soft brazen light lay like a shield against
      the sky, a strange, hovering thing. Parpon knew it to be the reflection of
      the campfires in the valley, where Lagroin and his men were sleeping.
      There came, too, out of the general stillness, a long, low murmur, as
      though nature were crooning: the untiring rustle of the river, the water
      that rolled on and never came back again. Where did they all go&mdash;those
      thousands of rivers for ever pouring on, lazily or wildly? What motive?
      What purpose? Just to empty themselves into the greater waters, there to
      be lost? Was it enough to travel on so inevitably to the end, and be
      swallowed up?
    </p>
    <p>
      And these millions of lives hurrying along? Was it worth while living,
      only to grow older and older, and, coming, heavy with sleep, to the
      Homestead of the Ages, enter a door that only opened inwards, and be
      swallowed up in the twilight? Why arrest the travelling, however swift it
      be? Sooner or later it must come&mdash;with dusk the end of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dwarf heard the moaning of the stricken girl, her cry, "Valmond!
      Valmond!" the sobs that followed, the woe of her self-abnegation, even in
      delirium.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one's self it mattered little, maybe, the attitude of the mind,
      whether it would arrest or be glad of the terrific travel; but for another
      human being, who might judge? Who might guess what was best for the other;
      what was most merciful, most good? Destiny meant us to prove our case
      against it, as well as we might; to establish our right to be here as long
      as we could, so discovering the world day by day, and ourselves to the
      world, and ourselves to ourselves. To live it out, resisting the power
      that destroys so long as might be&mdash;that was the divine secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Valmond! Valmond! O Valmond!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice moaned out the words again and again. Through the sounds there
      came another inner voice, that resolved all the crude, primitive thoughts
      here defined; vague, elusive, in Parpon's own brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl's life should be saved at any cost, even if to save it meant the
      awful and certain doom his mother had whispered to him over the bed an
      hour before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and went into the house. The old woman bent above Elise,
      watching intently, her eyes straining, her lips anxiously compressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My son," she said, "she will die in an hour if I don't give her more. If
      I do, she may die at once. If she gets well, she will be&mdash;" She made
      a motion to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blind, mother, blind!" he whispered, and he looked round the room. How
      good was the sight of the eyes! "Perhaps she'd rather die," said the old
      woman. "She is unhappy." She was thinking of her own far, bitter past,
      remembered now after so many years. "Misery and blindness too&mdash;ah!
      What right have I to make her blind? It's a great risk, Parpon, my dear
      son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must, I must, for your sake. Valmond! Valmond! O Valmond!" cried Elise
      again out of her delirium.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stricken girl had answered for Parpon. She had decided for herself.
      Life! that was all she prayed for: for another's sake, not her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her own mother slept on, in the corner of the room, unconscious of the
      terrible verdict hanging in the balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Degardy quickly emptied into a cup of liquor the strange brown
      powder, mixed it, and held it to the girl's lips, pouring it slowly down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, twice, during the next hour, a low, anguished voice filled the room;
      but just as dawn came, Parpon stooped and tenderly wiped a soft moisture
      from the face, lying so quiet and peaceful now against the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She breathes easy, poor pretty bird!" said the old woman gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She'll never see again?" asked Parpon mournfully. "Never a thing while
      she lives," was the whispered reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But she has her life," said the dwarf; "she wished it so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the good!" The old woman had divined why Elise had wanted to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dwarf did not answer. His eyes wandered about abstractedly, and fell
      again upon Elise's mother sleeping, unconscious of the awful peril passed,
      and the painful salvation come to her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blue-grey light of morning showed under the edge of the closed
      window-blind. In the room day was mingling incongruously with night, for
      the candle looked sickly, and the aged crone's face was of a leaden
      colour, lighted by the piercing eyes that brooded hungrily on her son&mdash;her
      only son: the dwarf had told her of Gabriel's death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parpon opened the door and went out. Day was spreading over the drowsy
      landscape. There was no life as yet in all the horizon, no fires, no
      animals stirring, no early workmen, no anxious harvesters. But the birds
      were out, and presently here and there cattle rose up in the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, over the foot-hills, he saw a white horse and its rider show up
      against the grey dust of the road. Elise's sorrowful words came to him:
      "Valmond! Valmond! O Valmond!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His duty to the girl was done; she was safe; now he must follow that
      figure to where the smoke of the campfires came curling up by Dalgrothe
      Mountain. There were rumours of trouble; he must again be minister,
      counsellor, friend, to his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half hour later he was climbing the hill where he had seen the white
      horse and its rider. He heard the sound of a drum in the distance. The
      gloom and suspense of the night just passed went from him, and into the
      sunshine he sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "Oh, grand to the war he goes,
             O gai, vive le roi!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Not long afterwards he entered the encampment. Around one fire, cooking
      their breakfasts, were Muroc the charcoalman, Duclosse the mealman, and
      Garotte the lime-burner. They all were in good spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For my part," Muroc was saying, as Parpon nodded at them, and passed by,
      "I'm not satisfied."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you get enough to eat?" asked the mealman, whose idea of happiness
      was based upon the appreciation of a good dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But yes, and enough to drink, thanks to His Excellency, and the buttons
      he puts on my coat." Muroc jingled some gold coins in his pocket. "It's
      this being clean that's the devil! When I sold charcoal, I was black and
      beautiful, and no dirt showed; I polished like a pan. Now if I touch a
      potato, I'm filthy. Pipe-clay is hell's stuff to show you up as the Lord
      made you." Garotte laughed. "Wait till you get to fighting. Powder sticks
      better than charcoal. For my part, I'm always clean as a whistle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you're like a bit of wool, lime-burner, you never sweat. Dirt don't
      stick to you as to me and the meal man. Duclosse there used to look like a
      pie when the meal and sweat dried on him. When we reach Paris, and His
      Excellency gets his own, I'll take to charcoal again; I'll fill the palace
      cellars. That suits me better than chalk and washing every day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think we'll ever get to Paris?" asked the mealman, cocking his
      head seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the will of God, and the weather at sea, and what the Orleans do,"
      answered Muroc grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hard to tell how deep this adventure lay in Muroc's mind. He had a
      prodigious sense of humour, the best critic in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For me," said the lime-burner, "I think there'll be fighting before we
      get to the Orleans. There's talk that the Gover'ment's coming against us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Done!" said the charcoalman. "We'll see the way our great man puts their
      noses out of joint."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's Lajeunesse," broke in the mealman, as the blacksmith came near to
      their fire. He was dressed in complete regimentals, made by the parish
      tailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so, monsieur le capitaine?" said Muroc to Lajeunesse. "Is the
      Gover'ment to be fighting us? Why should it? We're only for licking the
      Orleans, and who cares a sou for them, hein?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a go-dam," said Duclosse, airing his one English oath. "The English
      hate the Orleans too." Lajeunesse looked from one to the other, then burst
      into a laugh. "There's two gills of rum for every man at twelve o'clock
      to-day, so says His Excellency; and two yellow buttons for the coat of
      every sergeant, and five for every captain. The English up there in Quebec
      can't do better than that, can they? And will they? No. Does a man spend
      money on a hell's foe, unless he means to give it work to do? Pish! Is His
      Excellency like to hang back because Monsieur De la Riviere says he'll
      fetch the Government? Bah! The bully soldiers would come with us as they
      went with the Great Napoleon at Grenoble. Ah, that! His Excellency told me
      about that just now. Here stood the soldiers,"&mdash;he mapped out the
      ground with his sword, "here stood the Great Napoleon, all alone. He looks
      straight before him. What does he see? Nothing less than a hundred muskets
      pointing at him. What does he do? He walks up to the soldiers, opens his
      coat, and says, 'Soldiers, comrades, is there one of you will kill your
      Emperor?' Damned if there was one! They dropped their muskets, and took to
      kissing his hands. There, my dears, that was the Great Emperor's way, our
      Emperor's father's little way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But suppose they fired at us 'stead of at His Excellency?" asked the
      mealman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, mealman, you'd settle your account for lightweights sooner than you
      want."
    </p>
    <p>
      Duclosse twisted his mouth dubiously. He was not sure how far his
      enthusiasm would carry him. Muroc shook his shaggy head in mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, 'tis true we're getting off to France," said the lime-burner. "We
      can drill as we travel, and there's plenty of us for a start."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morrow we go," said Lajeunesse. "The proclamation's to be out in an hour,
      and you're all to be ready by ten o'clock in the morning. His Excellency
      is to make a speech to us to-night; then the General&mdash;ah, what a fine
      soldier, and eighty years old!&mdash;he's to give orders, and make a
      speech also; and I'm to be colonel,"&mdash;he paused dramatically,&mdash;"and
      you three are for captains; and you're to have five new yellow buttons to
      your coats, like these." He drew out gold coins and jingled them. Every
      man got to his feet, and Muroc let the coffee-tin fall. "There's to be a
      grand review in the village this afternoon. There's breakfast for you, my
      dears!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Their exclamations were interrupted by Lajeunesse, who added: "And so my
      Madelinette is to go to Paris, after all, and Monsieur Parpon is to see
      that she starts right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur" Parpon was a new title for the dwarf. But the great comedy, so
      well played, had justified it. "Oh, His Excellency 'll keep his oath,"
      said the mealman. "I'd take Elise Malboir's word about a man for a million
      francs, was he prince or ditcher; and she says he's the greatest man in
      the world. She knows."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That reminds me," said Lajeunesse gloomily, "Elise has the black fever."
    </p>
    <p>
      The mealman's face seemed to petrify, his eyes stood out, the bread he had
      in his teeth dropped, and he stared wildly at Lajeunesse. All were
      occupied in watching the mealman, and they did not see the figure of a
      girl approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muroc, dumfounded, spoke first. "Elise&mdash;the black fever!" he gasped,
      thoroughly awed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is better, she will live," said a voice behind Lajeunesse. It was
      Madelinette, who had come to the camp early to cook her father's
      breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word, the mealman turned, pulled his clothes about him with a
      jerk, and, pale and bewildered, started away at a run down the plateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's going to the village," said the charcoalman. "He hasn't leave.
      That's court-martial!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lajeunesse shook his head knowingly. "He's never had but two ideas in his
      nut-meal and Elise; let him go."
    </p>
    <p>
      The mealman was soon lost to view, unheeding the challenge that rang after
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lagroin had seen the fugitive from a distance, and came down, inquiring.
      When he was told he swore that Duclosse should suffer divers punishments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pretty kind of officer!" he cried in a fury. "Damn it, is there another
      man in my army would do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No one answered; and because Lagroin was not a wise man, he failed to see
      that in time his army might be entirely dissipated by such awkward
      incidents. When Valmond was told, he listened with a better understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that Lajeunesse had announced came to pass. The review and march and
      show were goodly, after their kind; and, by dint of money and wine, the
      enthusiasm was greater than ever it had been; for it was joined to the
      pathos of the expected departure. The Cure and the avocat kept within
      doors; for they had talked together, and now that the day of fate was at
      hand, and sons, brothers, fathers, were to go off on this far crusade, a
      new spirit suddenly thrust itself in, and made them sad and anxious.
      Monsieur De la Riviere was gloomy. Medallion was the one comfortable, cool
      person in the parish. It had been his conviction that something would
      occur to stop the whole business at the critical moment. He was a man of
      impressions, and he lived in the light of them continuously. Wisdom might
      have been expected of Parpon, but he had been won by Valmond from the
      start; and now, in the great hour, he was deep in another theme&mdash;the
      restoration of his mother to himself, and to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o'clock in the evening, Valmond and Lagroin were in the streets,
      after they had marched their men back to camp. A crowd had gathered near
      the church, for His Excellency was on his way to visit the Cure.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he passed, they cheered him. He stopped to speak to them. Before he had
      ended, some one came crying wildly that the soldiers, the red-coats were
      come. The sound of a drum rolled up the street, and presently, round a
      corner, came the well-ordered troops of the Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly Lagroin wheeled to summon any stray men of his little army, but
      Valmond laid a hand on his arm, stopping him. It would have been the same
      in any case, for the people had scattered like sheep, and stood apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were close by the church steps. Valmond mechanically saw the mealman,
      open-mouthed and dazed, start forward from the crowd; but, hesitating, he
      drew back again almost instantly, and was swallowed up in the safety of
      distance. He smiled at the mealman's hesitation, even while he said to
      himself: "This ends it&mdash;ends it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He said it with no great sinking of heart, with no fear. It was the
      solution of all; it was his only way to honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers were halted a little distance from the two; and the officer
      commanding, after a dull mechanical preamble, in the name of the
      Government, formally called upon Valmond and Lagroin to surrender
      themselves, or suffer the perils of resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!" broke out Lagroin, and, drawing his sword, he shouted: "Vive
      Napoleon! The Old Guard never surrenders!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he made as if to rush forward on the troops. "Fire!" called the
      officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty rifles blazed out. Lagroin tottered back, and fell at the feet of
      his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raising himself, he clasped Valmond's knee, and, looking up, said
      gaspingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adieu, sire! I love you; I die for you." His head fell at his Emperor's
      feet, though the hands still clutched the knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond stood over his body, one leg on either side, and drew a pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surrender, monsieur," said the officer, "or we fire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never! A Napoleon knows how to die!" was the reply, and he raised his
      pistol at the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fire!" came the sharp command.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vive Napoleon!" cried the doomed man, and fell, mortally wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that instant the Cure, with Medallion, came hurrying round the corner
      of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fools! Murderers!" he said to the soldiers. "Ah, these poor children!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Stooping, he lifted up Valmond's head, and Medallion felt Lagroin's
      pulseless heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer picked up Valmond's pistol. A moment afterwards he looked at
      the dying man in wonder; for he found that the weapon was not loaded!

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      "How long, Chemist?"
    </h3>
    <p>
      "Two hours, perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So long?"
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment he said dreamily: "It is but a step."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Little Chemist nodded, though he did not understand. The Cure stooped
      over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A step, my son?" he asked, thinking he spoke of the voyage the soul
      takes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the Tuileries," answered Valmond, and he smiled. The Cure's brow
      clouded; he wished to direct the dying man's thoughts elsewhere. "It is
      but a step&mdash;anywhere," he continued; and looked towards the Little
      Chemist. "Thank you, dear monsieur, thank you. There is a silver
      night-lamp in my room; I wish it to be yours. Adieu, my friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Little Chemist tried to speak, but could not. He stooped and kissed
      Valmond's hand, as though he thought him still a prince, and not the
      impostor which the British rifles had declared him. To the end, the
      coterie would act according to the light of their own eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is now but a step&mdash;to anything," repeated Valmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure understood him at last. "The longest journey is short by the
      light of the grave," he responded gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the door opened, admitting the avocat. Valmond calmly met
      Monsieur Garon's pained look, and courteously whispered his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Excellency has been basely treated," said the avocat, his lip
      trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, well, dear monsieur," answered the ruined adventurer.
      "Destiny plays us all. Think: I die the death of a soldier, and my crusade
      was a soldier's vision of conquest. I have paid the price. I have&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not finish the sentence, but lay lost in thought. At last he spoke
      in a low tone to the avocat, who quickly began writing at his dictation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief clause of the record was a legacy of ten thousand francs to "my
      faithful Minister and constant friend, Monsieur Parpon;" another of ten
      thousand to Madame Joan Degardy, "whose skill and care of me merits more
      than I can requite;" twenty thousand to "the Church of St. Nazaire of the
      parish of Pontiac," five thousand to "the beloved Monsieur Fabre, cure of
      the same parish, to whose good and charitable heart I come for my last
      comforts;" twenty thousand to "Mademoiselle Madelinette Lajeunesse, that
      she may learn singing under the best masters in Paris." To Madame Chalice
      he left all his personal effects, ornaments, and relics, save a certain
      decoration given the old sergeant, and a ring once worn by the Emperor
      Napoleon. These were for a gift to "dear Monsieur Garon, who has honoured
      me with his distinguished friendship; and I pray that our mutual love for
      the same cause may give me some title to his remembrance."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the avocat stopped him with a quick, protesting gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Excellency! your Excellency!" he said in a shaking voice, "my heart
      has been with the man as with the cause."
    </p>
    <p>
      Other legacies were given to Medallion, to the family of Lagroin, of whom
      he still spoke as "my beloved General who died for me;" and ten francs to
      each recruit who had come to his standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long pause, he said lingeringly: "To Mademoiselle Elise Malboir,
      the memory of whose devotion and solicitude gives me joy in my last hour,
      I bequeath fifty thousand francs. In the event of her death, this money
      shall revert to the parish of Pontiac, in whose graveyard I wish my body
      to lie. The balance of my estate, whatever it may now be, or may prove to
      be hereafter, I leave to Pierre Napoleon, third son of Lucien Bonaparte,
      Prince of Canino, of whom I cherish a reverent remembrance."
    </p>
    <p>
      A few words more ended the will, and the name of a bank in New York was
      given as agent. Then there was silence in the room, and Valmond appeared
      to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the avocat, thinking that he might wish to be alone with the
      Cure, stepped quietly to the door and opened it upon Madame Chalice. She
      pressed his hand, her eyes full of tears, passed inside the room, going
      softly to a shadowed corner, and sat watching the passive figure on the
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      What were the thoughts of this man, now that his adventure was over and
      his end near? If he were in very truth a prince, how pitiable, how paltry!
      What cheap martyrdom! If an impostor, had the game been worth the candle?&mdash;Death
      seemed a coin of high value for this short, vanished comedy. The man alone
      could answer, for the truth might not be known, save by the knowledge that
      comes with the end of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the Cure, where he knelt praying, and wondered how much of
      this tragedy the anxious priest would lay at his own door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is no tragedy, dear Cure" Valmond said suddenly, as if following her
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My son, it is all tragedy until you have shown me your heart, that I may
      send you forth in peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had forgotten Madame Chalice's presence, and she sat very still.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even for our dear Lagroin," Valmond continued, "it was no tragedy. He was
      fighting for the cause, not for a poor fellow like me. As a soldier loves
      to die, he died&mdash;in the dream of his youth, sword in hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You loved the cause, my son?" was the troubled question. "You were all
      honest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond made as if he would rise on his elbow, in excitement, but the Cure
      put him gently back. "From a child I loved it, dear Cure," was the quick
      reply. "Listen, and I will tell you all my story."
    </p>
    <p>
      He composed himself, and his face took on a warm light, giving it a look
      of happiness almost.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very first thing I remember was sitting on the sands of the
      sea-shore, near some woman who put her arms round me and drew me to her
      heart. I seem even to recall her face now, though I never could before&mdash;do
      we see things clearer when we come to die, I wonder? I never saw her
      again. I was brought up by my parents, who were humble peasants, on an
      estate near Viterbo, in Italy. I was taught in the schools, and I made
      friends among my school-fellows; but that was all the happiness I had; for
      my parents were strict and hard with me, and showed me no love. At twelve
      years of age I was taken to Rome, and there I entered the house of Prince
      Lucien Bonaparte, as page. I was always near the person of His Highness."
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, at sight of a sudden pain in the Cure's face. Sighing, he
      continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I travelled with him to France, to Austria, to England, where I learned
      to speak the language, and read what the English wrote about the Great
      Napoleon. Their hatred angered me, and I began to study what French and
      Italian books said of him. I treasured up every scrap of knowledge I could
      get. I listened to all that was said in the Prince's palace, and I was
      glad when His Highness let me read aloud private papers to him. From these
      I learned the secrets of the great family. The Prince was seldom gentle
      with me&mdash;sometimes almost brutal, yet he would scarcely let me out of
      his sight. I had little intercourse then with the other servants, and less
      still when I was old enough to become a valet; and a valet I was to the
      Prince for twelve years."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure's hand clasped the arm of his chair nervously. His lips moved,
      but he said nothing aloud, and he glanced quickly towards Madame Chalice,
      who sat moveless, her face flushed, her look fixed on Valmond. So, he was
      the mere impostor after all&mdash;a valet! Fate had won the toss-up; not
      faith, or friendship, or any good thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All these years," Valmond continued presently, his voice growing weaker,
      "I fed on such food as is not often within the reach of valets. I knew as
      much of the Bonapartes, of Napoleonic history, as the Prince himself, so
      much so, that he often asked me of some date or fact of which he was not
      sure. In time, I became almost like a private secretary to him. I lived in
      a dream for years; for I had poetry, novels, paintings, music, at my hand
      all the time, and the Prince, at the end, changed greatly, was
      affectionate indeed, and said he would do good things for me. I became
      familiar with all the intrigues, the designs of the Bonapartes; and what I
      did not know was told me by Prince Pierre, who was near my own age, and
      who used me always more like a friend than a servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One day the Prince was visited by Count Bertrand, who was with the
      Emperor in his exile, and I heard him speak of a thing unknown to history:
      that Napoleon had a son, born at St. Helena, by a countess well known in
      Europe. She had landed, disguised as a sailor, from a merchant-ship, and
      had lived in retirement at Longwood for near a year. After the Emperor
      died, the thing was discovered, but the governor of the island made no
      report of it to the British Government, for the event would have reflected
      on himself; and the returned exiles kept the matter a secret. It was said
      that the child died at St. Helena. The story remained in my mind, and I
      brooded on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two years ago Prince Lucien died in my arms. When he was gone, I found
      that I had been left five hundred thousand francs, a chateau, and several
      relics of the Bonapartes, as reward for my services to the Prince, and, as
      the will said, in token of the love he had come to bear me. To these
      Prince Pierre added a number of mementoes. I went to visit my parents,
      whom I had not seen for many years. I found that my mother was dead, that
      my father was a drunkard. I left money for my father with the mayor, and
      sailed for England. From London I came to New York; from New York to
      Quebec. All the time I was restless, unhappy. I had had to work all my
      life, now I had nothing to do. I had lived close to great traditions, now
      there was no habit of life to keep them alive in me. I spent money freely,
      but it gave me no pleasure. I once was a valet to a great man, now I had
      the income of a gentleman, and was no gentleman. Ah, do you not shrink
      from me, Monsieur le Cure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure did not reply, but made a kindly gesture, and Valmond continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sick of everything, one day I left Quebec hurriedly. Why I came here I do
      not know, save that I had heard it was near the mountains, was quiet, and
      I could be at peace. There was something in me which could not be content
      in the foolishness of idle life. All the time I kept thinking&mdash;thinking.
      If I were only a Napoleon, how I would try to do great things! Ah, my God!
      I loved the Great Napoleon. What had the Bonapartes done? Nothing&mdash;nothing.
      Everything had slipped away from them. Not one of them was like the
      Emperor. His own legitimate son was dead. None of the others had the
      Master's blood, fire, daring in his veins. The thought grew on me, and I
      used to imagine myself his son. I loved his memory, all he did, all he
      was, better than any son could do. It had been my whole life, thinking of
      him and the Empire, while I brushed the Prince's clothes or combed his
      hair. Why should such tastes be given to a valet? Some one somewhere was
      to blame, dear Cure. I really did not conceive or plan imposture. I was
      only playing a comedian's part in front of the Louis Quinze, till I heard
      Parpon sing a verse of 'Vive Napoleon!' Then it all rushed on me, captured
      me&mdash;and the rest you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure could not trust himself to speak yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had not thought to go so far when I began. It was mostly a whim. But
      the idea gradually possessed me, and at last it seemed to me that I was a
      real Napoleon. I used to wake from the dream for a moment, and I tried to
      stop, but something in my blood drove me on&mdash;inevitably. You were all
      good to me; you nearly all believed in me. Lagroin came&mdash;and so it
      has gone on till now, till now. I had a feeling what the end would be. But
      I should have had my dream. I should have died for the cause as no
      Napoleon or Bonaparte ever died. Like a man, I would pay the penalty Fate
      should set. What more could I do? If a man gives all he has, is not that
      enough? ... There is my whole story. Now, I shall ask your pardon, dear
      Cure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must ask pardon of God, my son," said the priest, his looks showing
      the anguish he felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Little Chemist said two hours, but I feel"&mdash;his voice got very
      faint "I feel that he is mistaken." He murmured a prayer, and crossed
      himself thrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure made ready to read the office for the dying. "My son," he said,
      "do you truly and earnestly repent you of your sins?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Valmond's eyes suddenly grew misty, his breathing heavier. He scarcely
      seemed to comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have paid the price&mdash;I have loved you all. Parpon&mdash;where are
      you?&mdash;Elise!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment of silence, and then his voice rang out with a sort of sob. "Ah,
      madame," he cried chokingly, "dear madame, for you I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Chalice arose with a little cry, for she knew whom he meant, and
      her heart ached for him. She forgot his imposture&mdash;everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, dear, dear monsieur!" she said brokenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew her voice, he heard her coming; his eyes opened wide, and he
      raised himself on the couch with a start. The effort loosened the bandage
      at his neck, and blood gushed out on his bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a convulsive motion he drew up the coverlet to his chin, to hide the
      red stream, and said gaspingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon, madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a shudder passed through him, and with a last effort to spare her the
      sight of his ensanguined body,' he fell face downward, voiceless&mdash;for
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very earth seemed breathing. Long waves of heat palpitated over the
      harvest-fields, and the din of the locust drove lazily through. The far
      cry of the king-fisher, and idly clacking wheels of carts rolling down
      from Dalgrothe Mountain, accented the drowsy melody of the afternoon. The
      wild mustard glowed so like a golden carpet, that the destroying hand of
      the anxious farmer seemed of the blundering tyranny of labour. Whole
      fields were flaunting with poppies, too gay for sorrow to pass that way;
      but a blind girl, led by a little child, made a lane through the red
      luxuriance, hurrying to the place where vanity and valour, and the remnant
      of an unfulfilled manhood, lay beaten to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Destiny, which is stronger than human love, or the soul's fidelity, had
      overmastered self-sacrifice and the heart of a woman. This woman had
      opened her eyes upon the world again, only to find it all night, all
      strange; she was captive of a great darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she broke through the hedge of lilacs by the Cure's house, the crowd of
      awe-stricken people fell back, opening a path for her to the door. She
      moved as one unconscious of the troubled life and the vibrating world
      about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hand of the child admitted her to the chamber of death; the door
      closed, and she stood motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure made as if to rise and go towards her, but Madame Chalice,
      sitting sorrowful and dismayed at the foot of the couch, by a motion of
      her hand stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl paused a moment, listening. "Your Excellency," she whispered. It
      was as if a soul leaned out of the casement of life, calling into the dark
      and the quiet which may not be comprehended by mortal man. "Monsieur&mdash;Valmond!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her trembling hands were stretched out before her yearningly. The Cure
      moved. She turned towards the sound with a pitiful vagueness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Valmond, O Valmond!" again she cried beseechingly, her clouded eyes
      straining into the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloak dropped from her shoulders, and the loose robe enveloping her
      fell away from a bosom that throbbed with the passion of a great despair.
      Nothing but silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved to the wall like a little child feeling its way, ran her hand
      vaguely along it, and touched a crucifix. With a moan she pressed her lips
      to the nailed feet, and came on gropingly to the couch. She reached down
      towards it, but drew back as if in affright; for a dumb, desolating fear
      was upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with that direful courage which is the last gift to the hopeless, she
      stooped down again, and her fingers touched Valmond's cold hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      They ran up his breast, to his neck, to his face, and fondled it, as only
      life can fondle death, out of that pitiful hunger which never can be
      satisfied in this world; then they moved with an infinite tenderness to
      his eyes, now blind like hers, and lingered there in the kinship of
      eternal loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      A low, anguished cry broke from her: "Valmond&mdash;my love!" and she fell
      forward upon the breast of her lost Napoleon.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the people gathered again in the little church upon the hill, Valmond
      and his adventure had become almost a legend, so soon are men and events
      lost in the distance of death and ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cure preached, as he had always done, with a simple, practical
      solicitude; but towards the end of his brief sermon he paused, and, with a
      serious tenderness of voice, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My children, vanity is the bane of mankind; it destroys as many souls as
      self-sacrifice saves. It is the constant temptation of the human heart. I
      have ever warned you against it, as I myself have prayed to be kept from
      its devices&mdash;alas! how futilely at times. Vanity leads to imposture,
      and imposture to the wronging of others. But if a man repent, and yield
      all he has, to pay the high price of his bitter mistake, he may thereby
      redeem himself even in this world. If he give his life repenting, and if
      the giving stays the evil he might have wrought, shall we be less merciful
      than God?
    </p>
    <p>
      "My children" (he did not mention Valmond's name), "his last act was
      manly; his death was pious; his sin was forgiven. Those rifle bullets that
      brought him down let out all the evil in his blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We, my people, have been delivered from a grave error. Forgetting&mdash;save
      for our souls' welfare&mdash;the misery of this vanity which led us
      astray, let us remember with gladness all of him that was commendable in
      our eyes: his kindness, eloquence, generous heart, courage, and love of
      Mother Church. He lies in our graveyard; he is ours; and, being ours, let
      us protect his memory, as though he had not sought us a stranger, but was
      of us: of our homes, as of our love, and of our sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so atoning for our sins, as did he, may we at last come to the
      perfect pardon, and to peace everlasting."

    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      (EXTRACT FROM A LETTER WRITTEN BY MADAME CHALICE TO MONSIEUR PADRE, CURE
      OF THE PARISH OF PONTIAC, THREE MONTHS AFTER VALMOND'S DEATH.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "... And here, dear Cure, you shall have my justification for writing you
      two letters in one week, though I should make the accident a habit if I
      were sure it would more please you than perplex you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prince Pierre, son of Prince Lucien Bonaparte, arrived in New York two
      days ago, and yesterday morning he came to the Atlantic Bank, and asked
      for my husband. When he made known his business, Harry sent for me, that I
      might speak with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Cure, hearts and instincts were right in Pontiac: our unhappy friend
      Valmond was that child of Napoleon, born at St. Helena, of whom he himself
      spoke at his death in your home. His mother was the Countess of Carnstadt.
      At the beginning of an illness which followed Napoleon's death, the child
      was taken from her by Prince Lucien Bonaparte, and was brought up and
      educated as the son of poor peasants in Italy. No one knew of his birth
      save the companions in exile of the Great Emperor. All of them, with the
      exception of Count Bertrand, believed, as Valmond said, that the child had
      died in infancy at St. Helena.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prince Lucien had sworn to the mother that he would care personally for
      the child, and he fulfilled his promise by making him a page in his
      household, and afterwards a valet&mdash;base redemption of a vow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But even as Valmond drew our hearts to him, so at last he won Prince
      Lucien's, as he had from the first won Prince Pierre's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not until after Valmond's death, when receiving the residue of our
      poor friend's estate, that Prince Pierre learned the whole truth from
      Count Bertrand. He immediately set sail for New York, and next week he
      will secretly visit you, for love of the dead man, and to thank you and
      our dear avocat, together with all others who believed in and befriended
      his unfortunate kinsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, dear Cure, think of the irony of it all&mdash;that a man be driven,
      by the very truth in his blood, to that strangest of all impostures&mdash;to
      impersonate himself&mdash;He did it too well to be the mere comedian; I
      felt that all the time. I shall show his relics now with more pride than
      sorrow. Prince Pierre dines with us to-night. He looks as if he had the
      Napoleonic daring,&mdash;or rashness,&mdash;but I am sure he has not the
      good heart of our Valmond Napoleon...."
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      The haymakers paused and leaned upon their forks, children left the
      strawberry vines and climbed upon the fences, as the coach from the
      distant city dashed down the street towards the four corners, and the
      welcoming hotel, with its big dormer windows and well-carved veranda. As
      it whirled by, the driver shouted something at a stalwart forgeron,
      standing at the doorway of his smithy, and he passed it on to a loitering
      mealman and a lime-burner.
    </p>
    <p>
      A girl came slowly over the crest of a hill. Feeling her way with a stick,
      she paused now and then to draw in long breaths of sweet air from the
      meadows, as if in the joy of Nature she found a balm for the cruelties of
      Destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a puff of smoke shot out from the hillside where she stood, and
      the sound of an old cannon followed. From the Seigneury, far over, came an
      answering report; and Tricolors ran fluttering up on flagstaffs, at the
      four corners, and in the Cure's garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl stood wondering, her fine, calm face expressing the quick
      thoughts which had belonged to eyes once so full of hope and blithe
      desire. The serenity of her life&mdash;its charity, its truth, its
      cheerful care for others, the confidence of the young which it invited,
      showed in all the aspect of her. She heard the flapping of the flag in the
      Cure's garden, and turned her darkened eyes towards it. A look of pain
      crossed her face, and a hand trembled to her bosom, as if to ease a great
      throbbing of her heart. These cannon shots and this shivering pennant
      brought back a scene at the four corners, years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Footsteps came over the hill: she knew them, and turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Parpon!" she said, with a glad gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word he placed in her hand a bunch of violets that he carried.
      She lifted them to her lips. "What is it all?" she asked, turning again to
      the Tricolor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Louis Napoleon enters the Tuileries," he answered. "But ours was the son
      of the Great Emperor!" she said. "Let us be going, Parpon: we will plats
      these on his grave." She pressed the violets to her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "France would have loved him, as we did," said the dwarf, as they moved
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As we do," the blind girl answered softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their figures against the setting sun took on a strange burnished
      radiance, so that they seemed as mystical pilgrims journeying into that
      golden haze, which veiled them in beyond the hill, as the Angelus sounded
      from the tower of the ancient church.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
