<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD"></a>FOREWORD</h2>


<p>These orations are selected from hundreds of similar addresses spoken
in recent years by hundreds of students in American colleges. I
believe it is not too bold to say that they represent the highest
level of undergraduate thinking and speaking. They are worthy
interpreters of the cause of peace, but they are, as well, noble
illustrations of the type of intellectual and moral culture of
American students. Whoever reads them will, I believe, become more
optimistic, not only over the early fulfillment of the dreams of peace
among nations, but also over the intellectual and ethical condition of
academic life.</p>

<p>For the simple truth is that the cause of peace makes an appeal of
peculiar force to the undergraduate. It appeals to his imagination.
This imagination is at once historic and prophetic. War makes an
appeal to the historic imagination of the student. His study of Greek
and Roman history has been devoted too largely to the wars that these
peoples waged. Marathon, Salamis, Carthage, are names altogether too
familiar and significant. By contrast he sees what this history, which
is written in blood, might have become. If the millions of men slain
had been permitted to live, and if the uncounted treasure spent had
been economically used, the results in the history of civilization would
have been far richer and nobler. He notes, too, does this student, that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Page viii]</a></span>
if the last decades of the eighteenth century and the first decades of
the nineteenth had been free from wars in Europe, humanity would now
have attained a far higher level of physical and intellectual
strength. The historic imagination of the student pictures, as his
reason interprets, such conditions. His prophetic imagination likewise
exercises its creative function. The student sees nations to-day
dwelling in armed truces and moving to and fro as a soldiery actual or
possible. He realizes that war puts up what civilization puts down,
and puts down what civilization elevates. He reads the lamented
Robertson's great lecture on the poetry of war, but he knows also, as
Robertson intimates, that "peace is blessed; peace arises out of
charity." The poetry of peace is more entrancing than the poetry of
carnage. To this primary element in the mind of the
undergraduate&mdash;the imagination&mdash;our great cause therefore
makes an appeal of peculiar earnestness.</p>

<p>To the reason of the college man, also, the cause of peace makes a
peculiar appeal through its simple logic. War is most illogical. It
breaks the law of the proper interpretation of causality. When two
nations of adjacent territory cannot agree over a boundary line, why
should settlement be made in terms of physical force? When two nations
fail to see eye to eye in adjusting the questions of certain fishing
rights, why should they incarnadine the seas in seeking for the truth
to be applied in settlement? In civil disputes, why, asks the student,
should rifles be employed to discover truth and right? War is an intellectual
anachronism, a breach of logic. Of course, one may reply, humanity is not
logical in its reasoning any more than it is exact in its observing.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Page ix]</a></span>
Of course it is not; but the college is set to cast out the rule of
no-reason and to bring in the reign of reason. Peace furnishes a
motive and a method of such advancement. Peace is logic for the
individual and for the nation.</p>

<p>The illogical character of war is also made evident by the contrast
between the college man as a thinker and war itself. The college man
who thinks sees truth broadly; war interprets life narrowly, at the
point of the bayonet. The college man who thinks sees truth deeply;
war makes its primary appeal to the superficial love of glory, of
pomp, and of circumstance. The college man who thinks sees truth in
its highest relations; war is hell. The college man who thinks sees
truth in long ranges and in far-off horizons; war is emotional, and
the warrior flings the years into the hours. The college man who
thinks, thinks accurately, with logic, with reason; war does not
think&mdash;it strikes. "Strike," the college man may also say, "but hear!"
he cries; "yes, think." If the college can make the student think, it
has created the greatest force for making the world and the age a
world and an age of peace.</p>

<p>It is plain enough, too, that the economic side of war makes a
tremendous appeal to the student. The cost of the battleship <i>Indiana</i>
was practically $6,000,000; the total value of grounds and buildings
of the colleges and universities in Indiana is slightly more than
$7,000,000, and the productive funds are $4,000,000. The total cost of
the battleship <i>Oregon</i> was more than $6,500,000; the total value of
grounds and buildings of the universities and colleges of Oregon is
less than $2,000,000, and the productive funds amount to hardly more than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Page x]</a></span>
$2,000,000. The cost of the battleship <i>Iowa</i> was nearly
$6,000,000, and the productive funds of all the colleges and
universities of the state are only $5,000,000. The battleship
<i>Kentucky</i> cost $5,000,000; in the colleges of that state the total
amount of productive funds is only $2,000,000, and the total value of
grounds and buildings, $3,000,000. The battleship <i>Alabama</i> cost more
than $4,500,000, and the entire property, real and personal, of all
the universities and colleges in that state is less than $4,000,000.
The cost of the battleship <i>Wisconsin</i> was more than $4,500,000; the
whole value of all grounds and buildings of the colleges and
universities of the state is only slightly more than $7,000,000. The
battleship <i>Maine</i> cost more than $5,000,000, and the entire value in
grounds, buildings, and productive funds of the colleges and
universities of that state is little more than $5,000,000.</p>

<p>The value of the buildings of five hundred colleges and universities
in this country was estimated in a recent year at $262,000,000, and
the productive funds at $357,000,000. Leaving out those now in course
of construction, the total cost of the battleships and armored
cruisers of the United States named after individual states is
$325,000,000.</p>

<p>The cost of maintaining these battleships during the fiscal year of
1910, though many were in commission but a small part of the year,
amounted to no less than $33,000,000. The amount which all the colleges
and universities in this country received in tuition fees in 1911 was only
$20,000,000; and the entire income received both from fees and productive
funds was only about $34,000,000. In other words, when one takes into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Page xi]</a></span>
account the depreciation of the battleship or armored cruiser, the
entire cost of the thirty-eight battleships for a single year is
greater than the administration of the entire American system of
higher education.</p>

<p>Is it not painfully manifest that the cost of war constitutes a mighty
argument for the economic mind of the student?</p>

<p>Moreover, I am inclined to believe that the very difficulties
belonging to the triumph of our great cause constitute ground for its
closer relationship to the college man. The college man wishes, as
well as needs, a hard job. The easy task, the rosy opportunity, makes
no appeal. He is like Garibaldi's soldiers, who, when the choice was
once offered them by the commander to surrender to ease and safety,
chose hardship and peril. The Boxer revolution in China was followed
by hundreds of applications from college men and women to be sent
forth to China to take the place of the martyrs. The difficulties in
the progress of the great cause are of every sort and condition.
Industrial narrowness and commercial greed, military and political
ambitions, sectional zeal, national jealousy, the sensitiveness of
each nation in matters of national honor, the glamour of the good and
the beautiful under the sentiment of patriotism, the historic honor
attending death for one's country, the ease of creating war scares
among the people, the looseness of the organization of the higher
forces of the world&mdash;all these conditions and more pile up into a
Pelion on Ossa as a part of the difficulties standing in the progress
of our great movement. But such difficulties inspire rather than deter.
The student says, "I will; therefore I can." He also says, "I can; therefore
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Page xii]</a></span>
I will." He knows that the forces fighting for him are
more than those that fight against him, strong as these are. Man in
his noblest relationships, the songs of the poet (the best
interpreter, from Homer and Virgil to the "Winepress" of Alfred
Noyes), the torture, the pains, the sufferings, the woes, the vision
of the prophet of a loving and perfect humanity, the reason of
logic&mdash;all these and more are to him inspirations, and strengthen him
in his great quest. He is a knight of the Holy Grail that is filled
from the river of the water of life.</p>

<p>Perhaps, furthermore, the cause makes its most impressive appeal to
the collegian in its internationalism, or interpatriotism. This
internationalism addresses itself to his own international
appreciation. The collegian is a patriot. He is a patriot not only
against a foreign country but often against certain parts of his own
country&mdash;loyal to the interests which he believes a section of his own
nation properly represents. The German students have fought for their
Fatherland; they have also fought for the liberal sentiments of their
own land against reactionary movements, as in 1848. In the American
Civil War no brighter record is to be found than is embodied in the
tablets in Memorial Hall, Cambridge, or in Memorial Hall, Chapel Hill,
University of North Carolina. But the collegian possesses the
international sense, and possesses it more and more deeply with each
passing decade. His is the international mind, interpreting phenomena
in terms of common justice. His is the international heart, feeling
the universal joys and sorrows, woes and exultations. His is the
international will, seeking to do good to all men. His is the
international conscience, weighing right and duty in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Page xiii]</a></span>
scales of divine humanity. Whatever interpretation he gives to the
sayings of Paul that God made all nations of men to dwell on the face of the
earth and has fixed the bounds of their habitation,&mdash;whether he stops
with the words "the face of the earth" or whether he goes on to
interpret the limitations of their residence,&mdash;it is nevertheless true
that his mind, his heart, his will, and his conscience do go out
toward all nations in their endeavor to realize their highest racial
and interracial peace. No man is a foreigner to him.</p>

<p>I have, I trust, said enough to intimate that these orations arise out
of a natural and normal condition of the student mind and heart. They
also, in subject as well as in origin, bear a special message of cheer
and hopefulness to all who have a good will toward the collegian and
toward the great cause for which we all are laboring.</p>

<h1>PRIZE ORATIONS</h1>

<h2><a name="THE_INTERCOLLEGIATE_PEACE_ASSOCIATION" id="THE_INTERCOLLEGIATE_PEACE_ASSOCIATION"></a>THE INTERCOLLEGIATE PEACE ASSOCIATION</h2>

<p><i>Origin.</i> In the autumn of 1904 President Noah E. Byers of Goshen
College, Goshen, Indiana, a Mennonite college, invited to a conference
representatives of all the colleges in Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Ohio
that are conducted by those religious denominations that advocate
nonresistance as one of their essential religious principles. Such
bodies are the Mennonites, the Dunkards, and the Quakers. In the
spring of 1905 a more specific invitation was sent out, with the
result that a conference was held at Goshen College, June 22-23, 1905.
This date is important, since the call of President Byers for such a
conference was the first active step ever taken to interest the
college world, and particularly undergraduates, in the great movement
for world peace founded upon the idea of human brotherhood. While the
conference did not take place until a month after President Gilman had
suggested to the Lake Mohonk Conference, in May, 1905, that it should
extend its peace work to the colleges and universities, yet the call
for the conference was several months prior to the action of the
Mohonk Conference.</p>

<p>Eight institutions were represented at this conference&mdash;Goshen,
Earlham, Central Mennonite, Ashland, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Page 2]</a></span>Wilmington, Juniata, and Penn
colleges and Friends' University. No definite plan of work had been
mapped out, but a simple organization was effected, and arrangements
were made for a second conference at Earlham College (Society of
Friends). Professor Elbert Russell of Earlham College was elected
president, and upon him devolved most of the work of arranging for the
second conference, which was held April 13-14, 1906. For this
conference no denominational lines were drawn, it being felt that all
colleges and universities should be interested in this important work.
Hence invitations were sent to all institutions of higher learning in
both Indiana and Ohio. Eight institutions were represented: Indiana,
three&mdash;Earlham and Goshen colleges and Indiana University; Ohio,
five&mdash;Antioch, Denison, Miami, Wilmington, and Central Mennonite. This
representation was small, considering the importance of the conference
and the excellent program that had been arranged for by Professor
Russell. But notwithstanding the small number of institutions
represented, the conference was a marked success, made so very largely
by the many excellent addresses&mdash;among others, those of Edwin D. Mead,
Benjamin F. Trueblood, Professor Ernst Richard of Columbia University,
and Honorable William Dudley Foulke.</p>

<p>On the last day of the conference the delegates from the different
colleges met and perfected a permanent organization, which it was
agreed should be called the Intercollegiate Peace Association. Thus,
after a year of preliminary work, the Intercollegiate Peace
Association came into definite and permanent existence on April 14,
1906. At this meeting Dean William P. Rogers of the Cincinnati Law
School was elected president, and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Page 3]</a></span>Professor Elbert Russell, secretary
and treasurer. The president and the secretary, President Noah E.
Byers of Goshen College, and Professor Stephen F. Weston of Antioch
College constituted the executive committee. The writer has remained
on the executive committee from the beginning, as either an elected or
an ex-officio member.</p>

<p>Two methods of propaganda were adopted: intercollegiate oratorical
contests, and public addresses on peace questions before the student
body and faculties of colleges and universities. It was also agreed
that the work should begin with Ohio and Indiana and gradually extend
to other states. Although no definite plan was formulated until a year
later, at the meeting at Cincinnati, it was understood from the outset
that it should be the aim gradually to extend the field of work, so
that ultimately most of the institutions of higher learning in
practically all of the states should be embraced within the
organization and participate in the contests.</p>

<p><i>Purpose.</i> The purpose of the association has been quite definitely
set forth in my "Historical Sketch"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and in my report for 1912. From
these the following statement is very largely borrowed. The
fundamental purpose of the Intercollegiate Peace Association is to
instill into the minds and hearts of the young men of our colleges and
universities the principle that the highest ideals of justice and
righteousness should govern the conduct of men in all their
international affairs quite as much as in purely individual and social
matters, and that, therefore, the true aim of all international
dealings should be to settle differences, of whatever nature, by
peaceful methods through an appeal to the noblest human instincts and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Page 4]</a></span>
the highest ideals of life, rather than by the arbitrament of the
sword through an appeal to the lower passions; and, further, both on
humanitarian and economic grounds, to arouse in the youth of to-day an
appreciation of the importance of a peaceful settlement of
international disputes, and to inculcate a spirit antagonistic to the
inhuman waste of life and the reckless waste of wealth in needless
warfare.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
Printed in <i>Antioch College Bulletin</i>, Vol. VII, No. 1, December, 1910.</p></div>

<p>This appeal to the idealism of youth is founded upon the psychological
fact that it is the ideals of life that determine the conduct of life.
It is ideals that rule the world; hence the importance of right ideals
based upon a comprehensive understanding of the real nature and
deepest implications of human fellowship. The alleged impracticability
is not in the ideal but in the difficulty of making the ideal such a
dominant part of our being that it shall consistently direct our
activities under every circumstance. One of the essential conditions
of human progress is the conviction that such ideals are vital to the
highest attainments and that these should be the aim of all our
strivings. Unfortunately such a standard of life is far from being
realized. Policy rules largely in the world of practical life; either
high ideals are considered impracticable, or there is no attempt to
enforce consistency between belief and practice.</p>

<p>Mindful of the further fact that the ideals and habits of thought and
action that prevail in mature life are those that are formed in youth,
the Intercollegiate Peace Association turns to the young manhood of
the undergraduate for its field of operations. The aim is to give such
a firm mold to the ideals of the undergraduate that they shall for all
time shape his activities to the end of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Page 5]</a></span>righteous conduct in all
international dealings. In particular, the aim is to cultivate in the
young men of our colleges and universities such sentiments and
standards of conduct as will insure their devotion to the furtherance
of international peace through arbitration and other methods of
pacific settlement rather than by battleships&mdash;standards of conduct
based upon the fundamental truth that conflicts between men, and
therefore principles of right and justice, can be rightly settled only
through the mediation of mind, and that every effort to settle them by
force is not only illogical, a psychological impossibility, but is the
way of the brute, not the way of man, whose nature touches the divine.
All the more important must this work with the undergraduate be
considered when we reflect that it is the young men in our colleges
and universities to-day who will mold the public opinion and the
national and international policy of the next generation; for it is
such young men as these that will control the pulpit and the press,
the legislation and the diplomacy of the future. It is this fact that
gives such peculiar importance to the work of the Intercollegiate
Peace Association. To quote from the report of the secretary for 1912:</p>

<p>"Other peace societies are laboring to create a public sentiment
to-day in favor of international peace, through arbitration of all
international differences. This is very essential. But the
Intercollegiate Peace Association is founded upon the belief that the
cause of peace will not triumph in a day, and that it is therefore of
the utmost importance that right ideals be rooted into the minds of
those who will give expression to the public opinion of the future. In
brief, it is building more for the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Page 6]</a></span>future than for the immediate
present. The millennium of peace will not come until the ideals of a
Christian civilization take deeper root in the minds and hearts of
those who are the leaders of thought and action. One of the crying
sins of to-day is that professions of righteous living in accordance
with Christian ethical ideals are not taken seriously. Note the
disgraceful policy that has been pursued with regard to Turkey by the
nations of Europe that profess to be disciples of the Prince of Peace.
Hence it is of the utmost importance that those who are to become the
future translators of ideals into action shall be imbued with right
principles of life and of human relations. To this end it is sought to
cultivate the right sentiment against war, and for international
peace, among the undergraduates of our colleges; for what the
undergraduate thinks about and reads about to-day will very largely
determine his future principles and his conduct, and it is he who is
destined to mold the ideals, shape the policies, and determine the
actions of the people of to-morrow."</p>

<p><i>Methods and Results.</i> To carry out these purposes two things are
essential: an awakened interest in the cause of peace, and some
definite and effective method for molding sentiments and habits of
thought that will persist with such vitality that they will give shape
to future conduct and activities. To arouse an interest in the
subject, on the part of both professors and students, it was believed
at the outset that public addresses would be effective, and it was
hoped that the association would be able to inaugurate a course of
such addresses in our colleges and universities. It was, however, soon
found that to finance such a course would require more money
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Page 7]</a></span>
than we could hope to command for some time to come. In consequence, very
little has been done along this line further than to arrange for
occasional addresses and to encourage chapel talks. It is this field
of work that the Lake Mohonk Conference voted to adopt at the
suggestion of Dr. Gilman. The conference also found it difficult to
carry out the plan, and our association was invited to assume the
whole of this work&mdash;a request we would gladly have accepted, but which
we were compelled to decline for want of funds. It is a very important
field of work and could be made very effective toward realizing the
ultimate goal of the Intercollegiate Peace Association, for its effect
would undoubtedly be the enlistment of a much larger number of the
students in the oratorical contests, which must be our chief reliance
for getting international peace ideas to take a vital root in the
undergraduate mind. If we cannot secure the necessary funds for
carrying on this important work, it is hoped that some other peace
society will do it for us, for such addresses could be made a most
effective complement to our work.</p>

<p>Being compelled to abandon the public addresses for want of money, we
have concentrated most of our efforts upon the intercollegiate
oratorical contests as perhaps the most effective method for carrying
out the purpose of the association. The contests are bound to arouse
an interest in the subject, while the preparation of orations is sure
to ingrain thoughts, sentiments, and convictions that will be
indelible in the character of the young men who participate in the
contests. While the contests are oratorical in their nature, their
primary purpose is not the cultivation of oratory. Oratory is simply
used as a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Page 8]</a></span>means to an end&mdash;the cultivation of right ideas of justice
and righteousness between nations. That such a result will accrue is
assured both in psychological principles and in experience. Every
student who produces a well-prepared oration in bound to make the
thoughts and sentiments expressed a part of his being. The oration
would not be effective if it were otherwise. The writer has heard
scores of these orations, and he is convinced of the sincerity and
earnestness of the orators. Moreover, letters written to him by those
who have won prizes, attesting their interest in and their devotion to
the cause, by reason of their participation in the contests, give
ample evidence that the contests are bearing fruit. Nor can one read
the orations in this volume without being convinced of their
sincerity.</p>

<p>Indeed, the reason why we do not have intercollegiate debates instead
of contests in oratory is because of the psychological truth, amply
justified by experience, that the student who prepares for the
negative side of a peace question would tend to have his thoughts
permanently fixed along the lines of the advocates of great armaments.
It is not that the student should not know the arguments opposing the
ideas of the advocates of peace by arbitration. We would not cultivate
bigotry even in a good cause. We would have him know the facts, as
indeed he must before he can present any arguments for peace that
would have any significance. But an acquaintance with the opposing
arguments is quite a different thing, in its effect upon the thought
of the student, from making that thought his own and publicly
defending it.</p>

<p>Other results may be mentioned. While the cultivation of oratory is
not a function of the Intercollegiate <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Page 9]</a></span>Peace Association, it does
foster oratory as a valuable if not an indispensable instrument for
effecting its own end. In fact, the oratorical contests are something
more than agencies for interesting undergraduates in the peace
movement. The cultivation of the art of expression and of public
speaking, now very generally provided for in college and university
curriculums, is of especial significance to the work of this
association. For it is not alone of importance that the graduate who
leaves his alma mater should be indoctrinated with a message of peace
for the world; that his message may be effective, he must also have
attained some proficiency in the art of clear and forceful diction and
in the art of delivering his message in a pleasing and convincing
manner. Therefore, it is not without reason that our contests are for
the most part under the immediate direction of the department of
English, or of whatever departments have charge of the public speaking
in the various colleges and universities.</p>

<p>A further factor in these contests is their cultural value, both moral
and intellectual. They necessarily cultivate the highest ethical
conceptions, historical and political knowledge, and careful and
logical thinking. To quote from the secretary's report for 1912: "The
work of the Intercollegiate Peace Association is a great force for
righteousness between nation and nation, and so between man and man,
and therefore may be considered as supplementary to the more strictly
moral and intellectual culture in our institutions of higher learning.
The ethical value is not the only value of the contests. In the
preparation of orations the undergraduate necessarily informs himself
of historical conditions, of the economic and social effects of war,
of the legal and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Page 10]</a></span>constitutional principles involved, and of the
problems, difficulties, and principles concerned with international
relations. It is this early beginning of an intelligent understanding
of the problems involved, together with the right moral insight, that
must count for future effectiveness in shaping international policies
and practices." Finally, while these contests have chiefly in mind the
shaping of the public opinion of coming generations, they are by no
means a negligible factor in their influence upon the public opinion
of to-day. The contests&mdash;local, state, and interstate&mdash;are heard by
many hundreds of people every year, and in many cases by persons who
would otherwise seldom come in contact with peace sentiments. The
permeating influence in college circles extends beyond those who
participate in the contests. The influence of any single contest may
indeed be small, but so too is the influence of any one peace
conference or congress. The task of molding public opinion along the
lines of any human uplift is always slow, and only gradually do the
influences of this character permeate and take possession of the
social mind; but every influence leaves its impression. It is only by
persistent activities and cumulative effects that the social mind can
be aroused to a full consciousness of any great moral issue, and still
more true is this when that moral issue is of national or
international importance. The many peace societies, the
Intercollegiate Peace Association among them, are just such persistent
activities, which, by gradually producing cumulative effects, will
ultimately reap their reward. But more perhaps than other peace
societies does the Intercollegiate Peace Association concern itself
with the social mind and the social conscience of the future.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Page 11]</a></span>
<i>The Contests.</i> The first oratorical contest was held at the
University of Cincinnati, May 17, 1907. Arrangements were made for the
participation of only Ohio and Indiana colleges. State contests were
not held, but fourteen orations were submitted from as many different
institutions, nine from Ohio and five from Indiana. The writers of
eight of these were selected by judges on thought and composition to
take part in the speaking contest. Four were from Ohio and four from
Indiana. Indiana won both the first and the second prize. The first
prize was won by Paul Smith of DePauw University with the subject,
"The Conflict of War and Peace." The second prize went to Lawrence B.
Smelser of Earlham College, whose subject was "The Solving Principles
of Federation."</p>

<p>The second contest was held at DePauw University, May 15, 1908.
Carrying out the plan adopted at the meeting at Cincinnati, the
contestants were selected by means of State contests, and an
invitation was extended to the colleges and universities of Michigan,
Illinois, and Wisconsin to participate in the contest. Wisconsin did
not respond, but contests were held in Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, and
Illinois. By special arrangement Juniata College was allowed to
represent Pennsylvania without a state contest. Glenn P. Wishard of
Northwestern University won the first prize; subject, "The United
States and Universal Peace." The second prize was won by H. P. Lenartz
of Notre Dame University; subject, "America and the World's Peace."</p>

<p>The third Interstate contest took place at The University of Chicago,
May 4, 1909, in connection with the Second National Peace Congress.
Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Page 12]</a></span>Illinois, and Wisconsin were represented,
all having held State contests. Levi T. Pennington of Earlham College
won the first prize; subject, "The Evolution of World Peace." The
second prize went to Harold P. Flint of Illinois Wesleyan University;
subject, "America the Exemplar of Peace."</p>

<p>The fourth annual contest was held at the University of Michigan, May
13, 1910. There were six contestants, Pennsylvania having come
regularly into the association. Arthur F. Young of Western Reserve
University won the first prize; subject, "The Waste of War&mdash;The Wealth
of Peace." The second prize went to Glenn N. Merry of Northwestern
University; subject, "A Nation's Opportunity."</p>

<p>The fifth annual contest was held at Johns Hopkins University, May 5,
1911, in connection with the Third National Peace Congress. There were
seven contestants, Maryland being represented for the first time. The
first prize was won by Stanley H. Howe, Albion College, Michigan, and
the second prize by Wayne Walker Calhoun, Illinois Wesleyan
University. Mr. Howe's subject was "The Hope of Peace," and Mr.
Calhoun's, "War and the Man." This contest was one of the most
successful that had been held up to that time. It was greeted by one
of the largest audiences that had attended any of the sessions of the
Peace Congress, and the comparison of the orations, in both thought
and delivery, with the speeches given in the congress, was very
favorable to the young orators. A general enthusiasm was evoked for
the contests. Yet there was much fear that this contest might prove to
be the last, there being no assurance <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Page 13]</a></span>ahead for adequate funds to
carry on the work. It was decided, however, not to give up without
further trial, a decision well justified by subsequent developments.</p>

<p>Assistance being secured from the Carnegie peace fund, eleven states
held contests in 1912. In addition to the seven that participated in
the contest at Baltimore, four additional states were added&mdash;New York,
North Carolina, Iowa, and Nebraska. With so many states, it became
necessary for the first time to divide them into groups. Two groups
were formed, an Eastern and a Western. The Western Group, of five
states, held its contest at Monmouth College, Illinois, April 26, and
the Eastern Group, of six states, at Allegheny College, Pennsylvania,
May 3. No prizes were given at either of these contests, but an
arrangement was made with the Lake Mohonk Conference by which the
ranking orator in each contest should meet and contest for first and
second place at Mohonk Lake at the time of the Lake Mohonk Conference.
The contest at Mohonk was held May 16, the contestants being Percival
V. Blanshard of the University of Michigan, who represented the
Western Group, and Russell Weisman of Western Reserve University, who
represented the Eastern Group. The title of Mr. Blanshard's oration
was "The Roosevelt Theory of War," and that of Mr. Weisman's,
"National Honor and Vital Interests." The Misses Seabury gave a first
prize of $75 and a second prize of $50. The judges awarded the first
prize to Mr. Blanshard and the second prize to Mr. Weisman. So great,
however, was the interest of the guests at Mohonk Lake, and so nearly
equal in merit were the orations, that a gentleman present gave <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Page 14]</a></span>an
additional $25 to Mr. Weisman to make the prizes equal, and Mr. Joshua
Bailey of Philadelphia gave each of the contestants an additional $50.</p>

<p>Five additional states&mdash;Maine, Massachusetts, Texas, Missouri, and
South Dakota&mdash;participated in the contests of 1913, making sixteen
states holding contests. Of these states three groups were formed, an
Eastern, a Central, and a Western. The Central Group held its contest
at Goshen College, Indiana, April 25; the Western Group at St. Louis,
May 1, as part of the program of the Fourth American Peace Congress;
and the Eastern Group at Lafayette College, Pennsylvania, May 13. The
same arrangements were made as in the preceding year&mdash;that the
contestant holding the highest rank in each group should meet in a
final contest at Mohonk Lake. No prizes were given, except that the
Business Men's League of St. Louis gave a prize of $100 for the
contest at St. Louis. The contest at Mohonk was held May 15, and three
prizes were given by the Misses Seabury&mdash;$100, $75, and $50. Paul B.
Blanshard of the University of Michigan, a twin brother of the Mr.
Blanchard who won the first prize in 1912, represented the Central
Group and won the first prize with the subject, "The Evolution of
Patriotism." Calvert Magruder, St. John's College, Annapolis,
Maryland, represented the Eastern Group and won the second prize. His
subject was "Certain Phases of the Peace Movement." Vernon M. Welsh,
Knox College, Illinois, represented the Western Group and won the
third prize. His subject was "The Assurance of Peace."</p>

<p><i>Growth.</i> The growth of the Intercollegiate Peace Association, like
that of most social movements, was slow in the first few years of its
existence, but with the gradual <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Page 15]</a></span>accretion of new states it has gained
in momentum, and is to-day increasing with such rapidity that only the
lack of financial support will prevent it from embracing in its
contests within another two years practically every state in the
Union. Starting with two states at the Earlham Conference in 1906 and
the first contest in 1907, it added three states in 1908, one in 1910,
and one in 1911, making seven states participating in the contests of
1911. Four more states were added for the contests of 1912, and five
additional ones for the contests of 1913 (nine states in two years),
making sixteen states in all. Since the contest in May, 1913, eight
states have been added for the contests of 1914, while the work of
organization is being carried on in several other states. By 1915 at
least thirty states will be holding contests if money can be secured
for properly financing them. Four groups are now definitely organized:
an Eastern, a Central, a Western, and a Southern. A Pacific Group is
in process of being organized. Thus, in seven years from the first
contest we have become a national association, extending from the
Atlantic to the Pacific and from the Lakes to the Gulf.</p>

<p><i>Prizes and Finances.</i> In order to encourage the young men to enter
the contests, the plan of offering prizes was adopted at the outset.
The national association made itself responsible for the state prizes,
leaving the local institutions to provide for such local prizes as
they could arrange for. In some places such prizes are given, being
provided for in different ways, and in some places no local prizes are
given. At first only $50 and $25 were given for the two state prizes,
but after the second year it was made a definite policy of the
association to make <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Page 16]</a></span>the first state prize $75 and the second prize
$50. With rare exceptions, in the case of the second prize, this
policy is now maintained. In New York, however, there is a first prize
of $200 and a second prize of $100, given by Mrs. Elmer Black. For the
past two or three years the national association has made itself
responsible for the first prize only, leaving the states to look after
the second prize, though the secretary also looks after many of the
second prizes. No prizes are regularly given in the group contests,
but it is hoped that a plan may be evolved for giving one prize, as
the expenses of the winning contestant are large. At the national
contest at Mohonk Lake, prizes are given to each contestant. In 1914
these prizes will probably range from $40 to $100.</p>

<p>The prize money has come from various sources. In 1908 Mr. Carnegie
gave $1000, and in 1909 he gave $700. The Misses Seabury, of New
Bedford, Massachusetts, gave $500 a year from the first. They gave
$750 in 1913 and will give $1000 for prizes in 1914. In Illinois La
Verne W. Noyes has annually given the first prize of $75 and Harlow N.
Higginbotham the second prize of $50. In Michigan R. E. Olds gave the
first prize until 1913, and J. H. Moores the second prize until 1914.
In Ohio Samuel Mather and J. G. Schmidlapp furnish the prizes for
1914. In New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Maryland the
prizes are given by individuals at the instigation of peace societies.
In some states the second prize is given by some individual or through
a collection from a number of individuals. The balance of the prizes
are paid out of the subvention of $1200 that has been allowed for the
past three years out of the Carnegie endowment fund. In <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Page 17]</a></span>1913 the
prizes amounted to $2400. In 1914 they approximate $3400, apart from
any local prizes that may be given.</p>

<p>The annual subvention of $1200 from the Carnegie peace fund is wholly
inadequate to meet the growing needs of this association. Since this
subvention was first granted, the number of states has been more than
doubled, and it takes about $600 a year to run the secretary's office.
Unless more money is secured from some source, the association will be
unable to grow beyond its present limits.</p>

<p><i>Officers and Organization.</i> The organization of the Intercollegiate
Peace Association has been a gradual development, and has undergone
modifications to meet the changing conditions due to the considerable
enlargement of the territory embraced within its sphere of activity,
chief of which has been the practical impossibility of getting
representatives to a national meeting from such a large extent of
territory. At first there were a president, secretary, and treasurer,
and an executive committee, with the college presidents of Ohio and
Indiana as vice presidents. At the meeting at DePauw University, in
1908, it was decided to create state committees, that should have
charge of the work in their respective states. As the states grew in
numbers the plan of having vice presidents was abandoned. In 1911 the
chairmen of the state committees were made members of an advisory
council, and in 1913 the executive committee was reorganized so that
there should be one member from each group of states in addition to
the president and secretary. When the organization is fully matured
the elected members of the executive committee will be a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Page 18]</a></span>
self-perpetuating body, only one or two going out of office in any
one year, re&euml;lection being permitted. The executive committee will
elect the president, executive secretary, and treasurer, and the
president and the executive secretary will appoint the members of the
advisory council, who will be ex-officio chairmen of the state
committees. The officers up to date have been as follows:</p>

<p><i>Presidents</i>: Dean William P. Rogers, Cincinnati Law School,
1906-1907; Professor George W. Knight, Ohio State University,
1907-1908; Professor Elbert Russell, Earlham College, 1908-1910; Dean
William P. Rogers, 1910-1911; President Charles F. Thwing, Western
Reserve University, 1911-.</p>

<p><i>Secretaries</i>: Professor Elbert Russell, 1906-1908; Mr. George Fulk,
Cerro Gordo, Illinois, 1908-1911; Professor Stephen F. Weston, Antioch
College, 1911-.</p>

<p><i>Treasurers</i>: Professor Elbert Russell, 1906-1908; Professor Stephen
F. Weston, 1908-.</p>

<p><i>Orations.</i> In the seven years in which the contests have been held,
about twelve hundred orations have been written, a little more than
one half of these in the past two years. The number written in 1914
will not fall far short of five hundred. For some time we have desired
to publish a volume of the prize orations, and within the past few
years there has been considerable demand for such a volume, as many
would-be contestants are anxious to see what they will have to measure
up to in order to win. Outsiders interested in the contests have also
desired such a publication. The present collection was therefore
projected, and the World Peace Foundation willingly undertook to issue
it as one of the books in its International Library.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Page 19]</a></span>
The ten orations that have been selected for this volume out of the
twelve hundred have all won the first prize in interstate contests.
The first five are the first prize orations in the national contests
of the first five years before the group contests were organized, and
were selected by a series of local, state, and interstate contests out
of about five hundred and fifty orations delivered. The last five,
selected by a series of contests out of about six hundred and fifty,
are the first prize orations of the group contests of the past two
years. They were delivered in the national contests at Mohonk Lake at
the time of the Lake Mohonk Conferences. The fact that many of the
second prize orations, and indeed a number of the others, were given
first place by some of the judges is indicative of the general high
character of all the orations, so that the ten selected orations are
very fairly typical of the thought and sentiment of the whole twelve
hundred. It is therefore believed that the publication of these
orations will be of great value not only as a stimulus to prospective
contestants but as a convincing proof of the quality of the work that
the undergraduate students of the country are doing in the contests.
They are evidence that these contests call out a high grade of
intellectual and moral culture, showing as they do keen and clear
thinking and high moral ideals.</p>

<p>There is included as an appendix to these orations the Pugsley prize
oration of 1913, by Bryant Smith, a senior in Guilford College, North
Carolina, a sample of the prize essays annually submitted for the
Pugsley prize of $100 offered through the Lake Mohonk Conference by
Chester DeWitt Pugsley of Yonkers, New York. The essay is also
fittingly printed in this volume because <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Page 20]</a></span>Mr. Smith represented the
state of North Carolina in the Eastern Group contest of the
Intercollegiate Peace Association in 1912, while still another reason
for including it is the hope that others who have taken part in the
oratorical contests, and who are thereby excluded from entering those
contests again, may be encouraged to try for the Pugsley prize.</p>

<p><i>Subjects of Orations.</i> In view of the fact that so many orations have
been written on peace subjects, it is worthy of note that the topics
have seldom been duplicated, and that when the same topic has been
twice used, the handling of it has been so different that little
duplication has been noticeable. Each oration well represents the
originality and the individuality of the writer or orator. Duplication
is shown in the quotations, and it is therefore suggested that
quotations be sparingly used.</p>

<p>Not the least interesting feature of the orations is the combination
of idealism and practicality, which they reveal in the minds of the
contestants. Truly, these young men "have hitched their wagon to a
star," the star of universal good will.</p>

<p>To show the wide range of subjects chosen, and therefore the scope and
many-sidedness of the peace question, the following list of titles
already used is given here. They are also given as suggestions to
future writers of orations, for there is no objection to choosing
subjects previously used. Even if there is some duplication of
thought, it makes little difference, since the contests are seldom
held twice in the same place. Included in the list are some titles
that show variations in the way of stating the same thing, and these
variations should be suggestive to future writers of orations.</p>

<i>Acknowledgments.</i> The Intercollegiate Peace Association is greatly
indebted to many state and city peace societies for co&ouml;peration and
assistance. They have materially strengthened our work and made
possible the enlargement of the field of our activities. To their
secretaries we are deeply indebted. The fullest co&ouml;peration of the
peace societies, each assisting and supplementing the work of others
wherever possible, will bring the most fruitful and the most speedy
results, and the fact that we have received such co&ouml;peration indicates
a full appreciation of the value of the work being done in these
contests. We wish also to express our gratitude to the many individual
contributors of prizes, especially to the Misses Seabury, for their
interest, encouragement, and generosity, because without their
assistance our association could not have survived. To the Misses
Seabury we are also under obligation for lending their rights over the
texts of orations for this publication. For the subvention from the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace we thank the American Peace
Society, through whose agency it comes to us. For the publication of
this volume we are deeply grateful to the World Peace Foundation,
without whose co&ouml;peration the book could not have been published. To
Edwin D. Mead and Denys P. Myers the editor owes his sincere thanks

<h4>SUPPLEMENT</h4>

<p><i>The Contests of 1914.</i> This volume was projected to be published
before the Lake Mohonk Conference in May, but it was decided to
include the five orations given in the national contest of 1914, and
so make the volume complete for the year of issue. The last five
orations, then, are the winning ones in the group contests of 1914,
contesting for place in the national contest at Mohonk Lake, May 16,
1914. They are the picked orations of over four hundred and fifty
prepared in one hundred and twenty colleges and universities,
representing twenty-two states. The fifteen orations in the volume are
the winning orations out of more than sixteen hundred and fifty
written by the student body of the country in the past eight years.</p>

<p>In 1914 six additional states took part in the contests, making
twenty-two organized into five groups. The Pacific coast and Southern
groups were added during the year to the three groups organized in
1913. Three of the groups held their contests on May 1&mdash;the North
Atlantic at the College of the City of New York, the Central at
Western Reserve University, and the Western at Des Moines College. The
Southern Group held its contest at Vanderbilt University on May 10. On
the Pacific coast only Oregon was ready, and the winner of her state
contest was permitted to represent the group in the national contest.
Utah and California are planning to enter the contests of 1915.
Virginia, West Virginia, and South Carolina are organizing, and a
sixth group will then be formed&mdash;the South Atlantic Group.</p>

<h2>THE CONFLICT OF WAR AND PEACE</h2>


<p>The past ages have witnessed a long conflict between two opposing
principles&mdash;the principle of might and the principle of right. The
first instituted the duel between equals and condemned the impotent to
slavery; the second ordained the courts of civil justice and signed
the Emancipation Proclamation. The principle of might licensed
despotism and degraded the many in the service of the few; the
principle of right proclaimed democracy and consecrated the few to the
service of the many. Thus in the realm of the individual and of the
state the diviner conception has won its triumphs, and to-day force is
tolerated only as it serves the cause of justice. But in the larger
international sphere the advocates of might prolong the ancient cry
for war; the disciples of right protest in a gentler demand for peace.</p>

<p>The partisans of war urge four capital reasons in behalf of their
principle: personal glory, moral education, class interest, and
national egoism.</p>

<p>We have as a heritage of our military past, not a sense of
the grim tragedy of war, but traditions which award the highest
meed of personal glory to the warrior. The roster of the world's
heroes contains two classes of names&mdash;great soldiers and
great altruists. Poet and orator and populace unite to do honor
to him who was not afraid to fight and to die for his home, his
king, his liberty, his country, his convictions. Bravery has
ever won its laurel crown, for an instinct within us applauds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Page 28]</a></span>
physical courage and aggressiveness. And the gilded uniform and
clanking sword, the drumbeat and the bugle call, the camp fire and the
"far-flung battle line," stand as the most dramatic expressions of a
deep sentiment, primitive and thrilling.</p>

<p>Akin to this martial hero worship is the argument that success in war
gives training for the higher contests of peace. Out of the war of
1776 the nation took George Washington for President; out of the
Mexican War, Zachary Taylor; out of the Civil War, General Grant; out
of the Spanish War, Theodore Roosevelt. The badge of the Grand Army of
the Republic is a certificate of merit. The cross of the Legion of
Honor opens the door to social and political and business prosperity.
Battle is regarded as a supreme test of sturdy manhood, and the harsh
discipline of the camp as education for the finer arts of the council.
War creates a heroism which later devotes itself to spiritual ends.</p>

<p>Moreover, say the advocates, the interests of class require force for
their conservation. The hereditary nobility of Europe was founded by
military process for military purposes, and, with the passing of war,
loses its warrant for existence. On the other hand, it is claimed that
the under classes may come into the enjoyment of their inalienable
rights, common to all humanity, only by means of the sword. Witness
the peasantry of Russia! Even in America so great a prophet as Henry
Ward Beecher foresaw a tragic day when the bivouac of capital would be
set against the camp of labor. And lesser seers are not lacking who
freely predict, even for our democratic land, a desperate rebellion of
a proletariat of poverty against an aristocracy of wealth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Page 29]</a></span>
Finally, the demands of national egoism are urged in behalf of war.
For example, Japan needs new territory for her growing millions and
must assume the conqueror's r&ocirc;le. Or France goes mad with the lust of
empire and goes forth untamed until the day of Waterloo. Or Great
Britain must have new markets; and, falsely reasoning that trade
follows the flag, and the flag follows the bayonet, she seizes a realm
upon which the sun may never set. Or the interests of white men and
yellow men, of black men or red men, clash; and then the cannon must
be the final test, might must make right, and the strongest must
survive. The greed of territorial aggrandizement, the spirit of
national adventure, the longing for commercial supremacy, the honor of
a country, the pride of racial achievement&mdash;each is urged to justify
the necessity for bloodshed and carnage. Such are the arguments of the
advocates of war.</p>

<p>To balance these, the advocates of peace plead four greater
considerations: against personal glory, the economic cost of
militarism; against the moral education of war, the higher heroism of
peace; against class interests, the sanctity of human life; and
against national egoism, the deeper spirit of national altruism.</p>

<p>A single modern battleship costs more than the combined value of the
property and endowment of all the colleges of a certain great state.
Two thirds of the money passing through the treasury of the Republic
goes to the support of the military system. Computing two hundred dollars
a year as the average loss to society occasioned by the withdrawal of
each soldier and sailor from productive toil, and adding this sum to
the war budgets of the nations for the past fifty years, we obtain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Page 30]</a></span>
a total of billions, beyond the reach of all imagination.
The money which armies, navies, wars, and pensions have cost the world
in fifty years would have installed in China a system of education
equal to that of the United States; would have transformed the arid
deserts of India into a modern Eden by irrigation; would have laid
railways from Cape Town to the remotest corner of Africa; would have
dug the Panama Canal; and, in addition, would have sent a translation
of the Bible, of Shakespeare, Homer, Goethe, and Dante to every family
on the globe. In a word, the wealth spent on wars in the last half
century would have transformed life for a majority of human beings.
The stoppage of this waste will shorten the hours of labor, reduce
pauperism, elevate the peasantry of Europe, lighten taxation, and work
an economic revolution.</p>

<p>The argument for moral education mistakes national gratitude to
warriors for tribute to the training of the camp. But grant that war
develops the combative qualities, the argument forgets a darker moral
phase. It forgets the moral wrecks which are the sad products of war;
it forgets the effect of the loss of the refining influence of
womanhood upon the soldier; it forgets the debasement of sinking men
to the physical type of life. And the argument assumes that peace has
no "equivalent for war," declared by a famous educator to be the
greatest need of the age. Courage and endurance are as necessary in
social reforms as in carnal battle. To wrestle against principalities
and powers and rulers of the world-darkness calls forth the maximum
powers of manhood. Wendell Phillips stands in the ranks of heroes as
high as Philip Sheridan. The moral loss from war transcends the moral
gain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Page 31]</a></span>
Yet war levies toll more tragic than any toll of dollars, more
appalling than any moral cost. A famous painting reveals the world's
conquerors, Xerxes, C&aelig;sar, Alexander, Napoleon, and a lesser host,
mounted proudly on battle steeds, caparisoned with gorgeous trappings;
but the field through which they march is paved with naked, mutilated
corpses, the ghastly price of glory. The trenches at Port Arthur were
filled level-full with the bodies of self-sacrificed martyrs, and upon
this gruesome slope the final charges were made. Stripped of all
sentiment, war is organized and wholesale murder, a savage and awful
paradox which proclaims the shallowness of civilization. Said General
Sherman: "Only those who have never heard a shot, only those who have
never heard the shrieks of the wounded nor the groans of the dying,
can cry aloud for more blood, more vengeance, more desolation." God
grant the world may soon heed the Voice, sounding down from the
solemnity of Sinai, laying the divine command upon each man and each
nation: "Thou shalt not kill!"</p>

<p>There yet remains the ethical argument for peace. Will any one
say that the supreme duty of altruism is binding upon men as
individuals, and not binding upon the same men acting conjointly
as a nation? When the people and the statesmen of one nation are
able to put themselves in the places of the statesmen and of the
people of another nation; when there is a common will to do
international justice rather than to despise the weaker country;
when not selfish interest alone, but the greatest good of the greatest
number, becomes the driving impulse of humanity; when the thrill of
fraternity crosses geographical lines and pauses not on the shores
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Page 32]</a></span>
of the seas&mdash;then war will be impossible, the energies of the
world will turn to the constructive arts, and from the midst of
contentment unshadowed by hunger, from prosperity unmenaced by want,
in the peaceful spirit of the Christ, the world will sing:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"The crest and crowning of all good, life's final star is brotherhood;<br />
For it will bring again to Earth her long-lost Poesy and Mirth;<br />
Will send new light on every face, a kingly power upon the race.<br />
And till it come, we men are slaves, and travel downward to dust of graves.<br />
Come, clear the way, then, clear the way: blind creeds and kings have had their day.<br />
Break the dead branches from the path: our hope is in the aftermath.<br />
Our hope is in heroic men, star-led to build the world again.<br />
To this Event the ages ran: Make way for Brotherhood&mdash;make way for man."<br />
</p></div>

<p>All great reforms have begun with "star-led" men and have moved from
individuals to groups and from groups to the nation. In every distinct
advance of the race prophetic persons have anticipated the trend of
the ages and have adopted new codes for themselves; the higher
morality has spread by agitation to include a larger group, and
finally it has become the policy of the nation. Thus slavery went, and
political equality came.</p>

<p>And thus war must go and peace must come. First, we find protest
against the killing of individuals by individuals. The duel fell
into disrepute and at last was forbidden by law. The carrying of
weapons became unfashionable and at length was made a crime. With
the growth of the moral sense, mutual trust took the place of
armed neutrality. The present situation is ready for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Page 33]</a></span>
the larger application of these principles. The argument which
abolished the carrying of weapons must frown upon excessive national
armaments. As the individual duel was superseded by personal
arbitration, so the national duel must be superseded by national
arbitration. The reason that maintains the civil court for the
settlement of individuals' disputes calls for a higher court for the
settlement of national disputes. Not alone among men, not alone within
states, but among the nations, right, not might, must rule; not force,
but justice; and written as the world's supreme mandate, as the
highest human law from which there may be no appeal, must be the
unshaken law of national righteousness.</p>

<p>Tennyson's words were accounted a poet's fancy when he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
Till the war drum throbs no longer, and the battle-flags are furl'd<br />
In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world.<br />
</p></div>

<p>Yet the present year<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
will witness the fulfillment of that prophecy.
Disarmament and arbitration will be considered this summer, not by
agitators, not by theorists, nor yet prophetically by poets; but in
June, at the invitation of our own President,<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
an actual international conference will assemble, a Parliament of the
World, composed of official representatives of every nation of the globe.
Thus we see the foregleams of an approaching day. The time is not far
distant when war will glide into the grim shadows of a scarce-remembered
past, when battles will pass into the oblivion of forgotten horrors. Then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Page 34]</a></span>
will society realize its dreams of a kingdom of heaven upon earth,
where the barbaric lure of fighting will be lost; where no class lines
may exist save those freely acknowledged by a common justice; where
national egoism maintains no armies for conquest and no navies for
aggrandizement; where economic resources are devoted, not to mutual
physical destruction, but to splendid spiritual enlargement; where
"every nation that shall lift again its hand against a brother, on its
forehead will wear forevermore the curse of Cain"; and where, in the
realization of a vast, racial brotherhood, is fulfilled the prophetic
angel's song, "Peace on earth, good-will to men." Ruskin, the modern
bard of peace, has sung:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
Put off, put off your mail, ye kings, and beat your brands to dust&mdash;<br />
A surer grasp your hands must know, your hearts a better trust;<br />
Nay, bend aback the lance's point, and break the helmet bar&mdash;<br />
A noise is in the morning winds, but not the noise of war!<br />
Among the grassy mountain paths the glittering troops increase&mdash;<br />
They come, they come!&mdash;how fair their feet,&mdash;they come that publish peace.<br />

<h2>THE UNITED STATES AND UNIVERSAL PEACE</h2>


<p>Political and religious reforms move slowly. We change our beliefs and
at the same time hold fast to old customs. Farsighted public opinion
has declared war to be unchristian; sound statesmanship has stamped it
as unjust; the march of events has, in a majority of cases, proved it
to be unnecessary&mdash;and yet we continue to build mammoth engines of
destruction as if war were inevitable. Truly, the millennium is not at
hand, nor is war a thing of the past; but whereas war was once the
rule, now it is the exception. This is an age of peace; controversies
once decided by force are now settled by arbitration. Europe, once the
scene of continuous bloodshed, has not been plundered by conquering
armies for more than a generation, while the United States has enjoyed
a century of peace marred by only five years of foreign war. The four
notable conflicts of the last decade have been between great and small
powers, and have been confined to the outposts of civilization; while
during the same period more than one hundred disputes have been
settled by peaceful means. The willingness to arbitrate has been
manifest; the means have been provided; the Permanent International
Court, established by the Hague Conference in 1899, actually lives,
and has already adjudicated four important controversies.<a name="FNanchor_1_4" id="FNanchor_1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_4" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Page 38]</a></span>
But arbitration, you say, will never succeed because the decisions
cannot be enforced. You forget that already some two hundred and fifty
disputes have been settled by this method, and in not one instance has
the losing power refused to abide by the decision.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_4" id="Footnote_1_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_4"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
From October 14, 1902, the date of the first decision, up
to the end of 1913, the Permanent Court has rendered thirteen
decisions settling international differences.&mdash;<i>Editor.</i></p></div>

<p>Yesterday the man who advocated universal peace was called a dreamer;
to-day throughout the world organized public opinion demands the
abolition of war. Yesterday we erected statues to those who died for
their country; to-day we eulogize those who live for humanity.
Yesterday we bowed our heads to the god of war; to-day we lift our
hands to the Prince of Peace.</p>

<p>I do not mean to say that we have entered the Utopian age, for the
present international situation is a peculiar one, since we are at the
same time blessed with peace and cursed with militarism. This is not
an age of war, yet we are burdened by great and ever-increasing
armaments; the mad race for naval supremacy continues, while the
relative strength of the powers remains practically the same; the
intense and useless rivalry of the nations goes on until, according to
the great Russian economist, Jean de Bloch, it means "slow destruction
in time of peace by swift destruction in the event of war." In Europe
to-day millions are being robbed of the necessaries of life, millions
more are suffering the pangs of abject poverty in order to support
this so-called "armed peace." Note the condition in our own country.
Last year we expended on our army, navy, and pensions sixty-seven per
cent of our total receipts. Think of it! In a time of profound peace
more than two thirds of our entire expenditures are charged to the
account of war.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Page 39]</a></span>
We do not advocate radical, Utopian measures; we do not propose
immediate disarmament; but we do maintain that when England, Germany,
France, and the United States each appropriates from thirty to forty
per cent of their total expenditures in preparation for war in an age
of peace, the time has come for the unprejudiced consideration of the
present international situation. Why do the great powers build so many
battleships? President Roosevelt, Representative Hobson, and others
would have us believe that England, Germany, and France are actually
preparing for war, while the United States is building these engines
of destruction for the purpose of securing peace. But what right have
we to assume that our navy is for the purpose of preserving peace,
while the navies of the European powers are for the purpose of making
war? Is not such an assumption an insult to our neighbors? As a matter
of fact, England builds new battleships because Germany does, Germany
increases her navy because France does, while the United States builds
new dreadnoughts because other nations pursue that policy. Call it by
whatever honey-coated name you will, the fact, remains that it is
military rivalry of the most barbarous type, a rivalry as useless as
it is oppressive, a rivalry prompted by jealousy and distrust where
there should be friendship and mutual confidence. There is riot one of
the powers but that would welcome relief from the bondage of
militarism; the demand for the limitation of armaments is almost
universal. Believing that to decry war and praise peace without
offering some plan by which the present situation may be changed is
superficial, we hasten to propose something practicable.</p>

<p>How, then, shall we put an end to this useless rivalry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Page 40]</a></span>
of the nations? At present a general agreement of the great powers on the
limitations of military establishments seems impossible. It remains
for some powerful nation to prove to the world that the great
armaments are not necessary to continued peace, with honor and
justice. Some nation must take the first step.<a name="FNanchor_1_5" id="FNanchor_1_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_5" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Why not the United States? The nations of Europe are surrounded by
powerful enemies, while the United States is three thousand miles from
any conceivable foe. They are potentially weak, while our resources
are unlimited. They have inherited imperialism; we have inherited
democracy. Their society is permeated with militarism; ours is built
on peace and liberty. Our strategic position is unequaled, our
resources are unlimited, our foreign policy is peaceful, our
patriotism is unconquerable. In view of these facts, I ask you, What
nation has the greatest responsibility for peace? Are not we Americans
the people chosen to lift the burden of militarism from off the backs
of our downtrodden brother?</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_5" id="Footnote_1_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_5"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
The widely heralded proposal in 1913 for a naval holiday
by all the great powers is the first move in this
direction.&mdash;<i>Editor.</i></p></div>

<p>Now what are we doing to meet this responsibility? On the one hand, we
are performing a great work for peace. Many of our statesmen, business
men, and laborers, united in a common cause, are exerting a tremendous
influence in behalf of arbitration and disarmament. On the other hand,
we are spending more on our military establishment than any other
world power;<a name="FNanchor_2_6" id="FNanchor_2_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_6" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
we are building more battleships than any other
nation;<a name="FNanchor_3_7" id="FNanchor_3_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_7" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> we are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Page 41]</a></span>
no longer trusting our neighbors; we are warning them to beware of our
mailed fist; and we are thereby declaring to the world that we have
lost our faith in the power of justice and are now trusting to the
force of arms.</p>

The orator is comparing the cost of the United States
army, navy, and pensions upkeep with the military establishments of
other powers.&mdash;<i>Editor.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_7" id="Footnote_3_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_7"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
Since naval rivalry in its acute form has centered
between Great Britain and Germany, European naval building programs
have exceeded those of the United States.&mdash;<i>Editor.</i></p></div>

<p>And why this paradoxical situation? Why do we at the same time prepare
for war and work for peace? It is simply because many of our statesmen
honestly believe that the best way to preserve peace is to prepare for
war. It is true that a certain amount of strength tends to command
respect, and for that reason a navy sufficient for self-defense is
warranted. Such a navy we now have. Why should it be enlarged? Naval
enthusiasts would have us prepare, not for the probable but for the
possible. Seize every questionable act of our neighbors, they say,
magnify it a thousand times, publish it in letters of flame throughout
the land, and make every American citizen believe that the great
powers are prepared to destroy us at any moment. Having educated the
people up to a sense of threatened annihilation, they burden them with
taxes, build artificial volcanoes dedicated to peace, parade them up
and down the high seas, and defy the world to attack us. Then, they
say, we shall have peace. Is this reasonable? As sure as thought leads
to action, so preparation for war leads to war. This argument that the
United States, since she is a peace-loving nation, should have the
largest navy in the world in order to preserve peace is illogical and
without foundation. By what divine right does the United States assume
the r&ocirc;le of preserving the world's peace at the cannon's mouth? Since
when has it been true that might makes right, and that peace can be
secured only by acting the part of a bully? It is unjust, it is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Page 42]</a></span>
unpatriotic, it is unstatesmanlike, for men to argue that the United
States should browbeat the world into submission; that she should
build so many battleships that the nations of the Eastern hemisphere
will be afraid to oppose the ironclad dragon of the Western
Hemisphere. Peace purchased at the price of brute force is unworthy of
the name. Surely the United States cannot afford to be guilty of such
an injustice. If we wish to be free; if we wish to remain a true
republic; if we purpose to continue our mighty work for humanity, we
must limit our preparations for war. The best way to preserve peace is
to think peace, to believe in peace, and to work for peace.</p>

<p>The extent to which the great powers will go in order to secure
enthusiasm for their military establishments is almost beyond
comprehension. Each nation has its great military rendezvous, its
grand naval parades, its magnificent display of gorgeous military
uniforms, its wave of colors, blare of trumpets, and bursts of martial
music. The United States is now sending her navy around the world&mdash;for
the purpose of training the seamen?&mdash;certainly, but also that the
youth of our land may be intoxicated by the apparent glory of it all,
and thus enlist for service; that the American citizens may be aroused
to greater enthusiasm by this magnificent display of the implements of
legalized murder, and thus be willing to build more floating arsenals
rather than irrigate arid lands, develop internal waterways, build
hospitals, schools, and colleges.</p>

<p>The trouble with such exhibitions is, that it displays
only the bright side of militarism. If in place of the
Russian battleships they should display the starving masses
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Page 43]</a></span>
of dejected and despised beings who pay for those battleships; if in
place of the gay German uniforms they should exhibit the rags of the
disheartened peasants who pay for those uniforms; if in place of the
grand parade they should produce masses of wounded men and rivers of
blood; if in place of the stirring martial music they should produce
the writhing agonies and awful groans of dying men; if in place of
sham war they should produce actual war,&mdash;their exhibitions would
make militarism unbearable.</p>

<p>Again, we are told that we have suddenly become a world power, and
that we must prepare to exercise a new diplomacy under new conditions.
We must increase our navy, they say, to enforce this new diplomacy. We
must prepare to fight in behalf of the Monroe Doctrine. But why, I
ask, cannot this new diplomacy be enforced as American diplomacy has
always been enforced? We promulgated the Monroe Doctrine without a
navy; we have maintained it for over eighty years without the show of
force. If our new diplomacy is right, it is as strong as the world's
respect for righteousness; if it is wrong, a hundred battleships
cannot enforce it.</p>

<p>We have become a world power, and therefore we have a world-wide
responsibility, and that responsibility is to establish justice, not
force; to build colleges, not battleships; to enthrone love, not hate;
to insure peace, not war. Our mission is to strike the chains from the
ankles of war-burdened humanity. Our duty is to proclaim in the name
of the Most High our faith in the power of justice as opposed to the
force of arms. May it be said of us that we found the world burdened
with militarism, but left it blessed with peace; that we found liberty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Page 44]</a></span>
among the strong alone, but left it the birthright of the weak; that
we found humanity a mass of struggling individuals, but left it a
united brotherhood. May it be said of us that we found peace purchased
by suffering, but left it as free as air; that we found peace bruised
and stained with militarism, but left it ruling the world through love
and liberty. May it be said of us that we fulfilled our mission as a
world power; that we were brave enough and strong enough to lead the
world into the path of universal peace.</p>

<h2>THE EVOLUTION OF WORLD PEACE</h2>

<p>In the progress of the world the dream of yesterday becomes the
confident hope of to-day and the realized fact of to-morrow. As old
systems fail to meet new conditions and new ideals, they are
discarded; and into the limbo of worse than useless things is passing
the system of human sacrifice to the Moloch of international warfare.
For centuries world peace has been the dream of the poet, the
philanthropist, the statesman, and the Christian. That dream is
becoming a confident hope. This generation should see it an
accomplished fact.</p>

<p>There was a time when individual prowess determined the issue of every
difference. Might made right, so it was thought, and the winner in any
controversy was he who had the heaviest club, the strongest arm, or
the thickest skull. Man's interrelationships multiplied as humanity
advanced; with each new relation came new causes for quarrel, and for
a time advancing civilization brought but increase in murders and
assassinations.</p>

<p>We know the process by which personal combat ceased; how the duel
replaced murder and ambush and assassination; how courts of law replaced
the duel. The dreamer saw the day when personal combat should be no more;
the man of mind refuted all the arguments in favor of the duel of men;
the constructive statesman of that early day instituted courts of law
and equity. Men who had a difference insisted that it was their quarrel
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Page 48]</a></span>
and they alone could settle it; but reason saw that two combatants
inflamed by passion are least fitted of all men to see where justice
lies. Many held that where honor is involved, no one can adjust the
difficulty but those most directly concerned; but reason saw that a
man's honor cannot be vindicated by killing his enemy or being killed
by him. Men said, "If personal combat is abolished, courage and
strength will perish from the earth." But reason saw that personal
combat in a selfish cause does not bring out the highest type of
courage; and that there are opportunities enough for the exercise of
the highest and best moral and physical courage to keep valor alive
forever. It was finally urged that there would be no power to enforce
the decree if personal differences were left to the adjudication of
others; but reason said, "That power will come with the need for it."
And so courts of law and equity arose, based on the need of humanity;
laws were passed defining rights and limiting aggression; and when one
man wronged another, that wrong was settled in court by the power of
the whole people and not in personal combat with the bludgeon or the
knife.</p>

<p>For similar reasons wars between states and tribes have ceased; and
face to face with the inevitable logic of past progress stands the
world to-day. Though humanity has been slow to see it, the truth has
begun to dawn in the hearts of men&mdash;that international wars are no
more to be justified than civil strife, tribal warfare, or personal
combat. Gradually the omnipotent power of right is overcoming the
inertia of humanity, and the world is moving. One by one the awful
truths concerning war are forcing themselves upon the consciousness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Page 49]</a></span>
and the conscience of men. The mighty power of fact is beating down
the opposition to world peace.</p>

<p>Men have begun to realize the terrible cost, the unbelievable
wastefulness of actual war, and the preparation for possible war. When
we read that the armed peace of Europe the past thirty-seven years has
cost $111,000,000,000, nearly as much as the aggregate value of all
the resources of the United States, the richest nation on earth, the
figures are so appalling that mortal mind cannot conceive them, and
they lose their force. When we remember that two thirds of the
national revenues of the United States are spent on wars past or
prospective, the matter comes closer home. When we realize that the
cost of a single battleship exceeds the value of all the grounds and
buildings of all the colleges and universities in Illinois, the
figures have more meaning to us. And when we reflect that the cost of
a single shot from one of the great guns of that battleship would
build a home for an American family, a comfortable home costing $1700,
the common man realizes that the richest nation on earth cannot afford
to go to war nor prepare for war.</p>

<p>But mere money is one of the cheapest things in all the world. The
price of war never can be paid in gold. Not in national treasuries can
you see the payment of that price, where smug, well-groomed
politicians sign bonds and bills of credit. If you would see the
payment of that price of war, you must go to the place of war. With
all your senses open, step upon the battlefield. Smell the smoke of
burning powder, the reek of charging horses, the breath of fresh, red,
human blood. Feel the warmth of that blood as you seek to stanch the
wound in the breast of one of the world's bravest, dying for he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Page 50]</a></span>
knows not what. Hear the screams of the shells, the booming roar of the
cannonade, the clash of the onslaught, the shrieks of the wounded, the
groans of the dying, the last gasp of him whose life has reached its
end. Such is the infernal music of war. See the victim of the conflict
reel in the saddle and fall headlong. Cast your eyes on the mangled
forms of godlike men, fallen in the midst of fullest life. Come in the
night after the battle and look upon the ghastly faces upturned in the
moonlight. Gaze on the windrows of the dead, Mars's awful harvest,
that impoverishes all and enriches none, and you know something of the
cost of war.</p>

<p>And yet we have seen but little. Could we but enter the wasted homes
and see the broken hearts that war has made; could we go to the
almshouses and soldiers' orphans' homes and see widows and children by
the thousand suffering the doled-out charity of state or nation
because war has robbed them of their rightful protectors; could we but
realize the agony of the broken home, a thousandfold worse than the
agony of the battlefield,&mdash;then might we know more of the real cost of
war.</p>

<p>And still our idea would be inadequate, though we realized the full
measure of every groan and heartache. Earth's most priceless treasures
are still more intangible things, the treasures of justice and
kindliness and love. In that higher realm the cost of war is most
terrible and most deadly. The spirit of war in the soldier sets aside
the moral law, makes human life seem valueless, human suffering a
thing to be disregarded, human slaughter an honorable profession. The
war spirit blinds the eye of the statesman, till wrong seems right,
folly seems expediency, and the death of thousands seems preferable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Page 51]</a></span>
to the life and happiness of all under terms of peace not dictated by
his own will. Justice is dethroned, and revenge takes up the iron
scepter and lets fly the thunderbolt. The war spirit perverts the mind
of the publicist, till the achievements of honorable peace sink into
insignificance, and the press clamors for the war that means money to
the publisher but death to innocent thousands who can have no possible
interest in the conflict. The war spirit takes possession of the
pulpit, and the minister called to preach the loving message of the
Prince of Peace stirs up the spirit of contention and animosity, of
hate and murder. Could we but draw aside the curtain and, back of the
tinsel and gold braid, see the crime, the hate, the moral degradation
that war always brings, never again would a friend of humanity ask for
war.</p>

<p>But the eyes of the world are opening to the fact that the cost of war
is far too high in money and in men, in suffering and sacrifice, and
in those higher values of justice and kindliness and love. And as the
thought once grew that personal differences might be settled without
personal combat, so men are looking toward the settlement of
international difficulties without recourse to the sword. They have
seen that every argument against the duel of men applies with still
greater force against the duel of nations. And the world has moved
farther toward world peace in the past twenty-five years than in all
the centuries of history that have preceded. World peace has become
not the dream of the poet but the confident hope of the world, whose
realization is the task whose accomplishment is set for the men of
this generation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Page 52]</a></span>
One by one the obstacles to world peace are being broken down.
Commerce has destroyed much of international prejudice. Community of
interest has obviated many former causes of quarrel. The sophistical
arguments of the friends of war are being answered by the logic of
hard facts. Warfare has been ameliorated by international agreement.
Vast reaches of territory have been neutralized. Unfortified cities
are no longer to be bombarded in any country. Actual disarmament has
taken place between the United States and Canada, between Chile and
Argentina.<a name="FNanchor_1_8" id="FNanchor_1_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_8" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Norway and Sweden have separated peaceably. Bulgaria has
achieved her independence without bloodshed. The Dogger Bank incident,
which a century earlier would have plunged England and Russia into
war, has been adjusted amicably. Two Hague Conferences have advanced
tremendously the progress of international amity. Over eighty
arbitration treaties are now in force. We already have a permanent
high court of nations, to which are being referred questions that
would once have resulted in war. And we are nearer than the dreamer of
last century dared hope to "the Parliament of man, the Federation of
the world."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_8" id="Footnote_1_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_8"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The famous "disarmament" between the Argentine Republic
and Chile was brought about by a series of four documents of May 28,
1902, one of July 10, 1902, and one of January 9, 1903. A preliminary
protocol declares the disposition of both countries "to remove all
causes for trouble in their international relations." A general treaty
of arbitration unlimited in scope was signed for a period of ten
years. A convention bound each country to "desist from acquiring the
vessels of war now building for them, and from henceforth making new
acquisitions." Article II says that "the two governments bind
themselves not to increase their naval armaments during a period of
five years, without previous notice." As a result of arbitration
resulting from this series of agreements the frontier was disarmed and
remains free from military posts. New naval programs of both countries
were formulated after the expiration of the period of abnegation, and
dreadnoughts are now in course of construction.&mdash;<i>Editor.</i></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Page 53]</a></span>
But not yet has the millennium dawned. In the face of all this
progress, armies and navies are stronger and more burdensome than
ever. The United States spends more on wars past and prospective than
for all educational purposes, and England, France, Germany, Russia,
groan under the burdens of the armed peace of Europe. Armed to the
teeth, the nations of the world lie watching one another. The mind of
the world is convinced that war is futile and terribly wasteful. The
heart of the world is convinced that war is cruel and inexcusable. The
conscience of the world has admitted that war is wrong and morally
unjustifiable. And still the preparation for war goes on, and unless
conditions are changed, war is inevitable. What is to be done? The
world's will must be moved, and men must be led to do what they have
already admitted is right and just and expedient.</p>

<p>As we have led in other days, so must America lead to-day. As the
light of republican government and complete justice to the individual
first saw full dawn in the United States, so the eyes of the world are
turned toward us to see the dawn of world peace, and full justice to
all the nations. It is ours to lead. The example of the United States
will do more than a century of argument and conference. America should
begin the disarmament that will eventually mean the triumph of world
peace.</p>

<p>We have naught to fear. We are far distant from the storm
centers of the world. We have no foes within that demand a large
standing army, and there are no enemies without that are anxious
to try conclusions with us on land or sea. Then away with war
talk and war scares and "jingoism." In time of peace let us
prepare for peace, that all the world may enjoy peace. American
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Page 54]</a></span>
disarmament will be a tremendous stride toward the accomplishment of
the world's desire&mdash;the cessation of international warfare; a
great world's court, to settle all international differences; an
international police force, to give effect to the decrees of this
court; and the end of the burdens of armies and navies under which the
whole world is groaning. Let heart and voice and pen, pulpit and press
and platform, soldier and statesmen and private citizen, ask for
peace, and not for war.</p>

<p>This is a part of the world's larger hope. Pessimists there are who
say that human nature is belligerent, and that war will never be
abolished. But international warfare has already seen the handwriting
on the wall. Mars has been weighed in the balances and found wanting.
The fruitless slaughter of the millions is not to be forever nor for
long. Let us hasten the day when the rolling war drum will be hushed
forever, the bugle note no longer call to carnage; when "nation shall
not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any
more." Love shall take the place of Hate, and Justice sit on the
throne instead of Greed. Some day in the not distant future the
nations that have all these centuries bowed before the god of war
shall own eternal allegiance to the Prince of Peace. And "of the
increase of His government and of Peace there shall be no end."</p>

<h2>THE WASTE OF WAR&mdash;THE WEALTH OF PEACE</h2>

<p>In the worship of Mars, Herodotus tells us, the ancient Scythian
erected an old scimitar at the summit of a huge brush heap. To this,
as a symbol of the great god of war, he offered not only the produce
of the land but also human life in sacrifice. We shudder as we picture
the priest standing over his victim, his hands wet with the blood of
his fellow man. We cry out in horror as we think of the lives these
peoples sacrificed. We call it an inhuman glorification of a pagan
deity. We call it a ruthless waste of wealth and human life. These
practices we pronounce to be the result of a popular delusion&mdash;a false
sense of obligation to the spirit of war. Yet from the time the
Scythian drew the blood of his victim in homage to the great war god,
even down to our own day, the nations have paid homage to Mars.</p>

<p>Though we boast of our progress in civilization, history reveals the
fact that we, too, have been the victims of the Scythian's delusion.
Is it not a fact that one of the most terrible customs of savage men
counts among its followers to-day all the nations of the earth? The
subtlest skill of the scientist, the keenest intelligence of the statesman,
vast stores of the world's resources, are devoted to maintaining great
armies and navies, to inventing new means of attack or defense, to
enlarging and making more deadly the enginery of war. What is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Page 58]</a></span>
our boast of civilization, while we tolerate this devotion of so
many men and so much of wealth to war? Is this not a sacrifice
essentially pagan in spirit? Are we not still paying unrighteous
homage to Mars?</p>

<p>Why, then, we ask, do nations make provision for war the first
necessity of national life? Behold Russia. A few years ago, in time of
famine, spending millions of money for war equipment when millions of
her own peasantry were slowly starving for the lack of one dollar's
worth of food per month. What motive impelled Russia to this heathen
conduct? It was solely that Germany, France, England, Japan, and the
United States had great armies and navies against which starving
Russia must be prepared to defend herself. What dire stress compels
England to-day to perpetuate her program of naval supremacy when she
is struggling in the throes of budget difficulties which seem all but
unsolvable? What is it that compels Germany and France to tax
themselves until they fairly stagger under the burden of military
expenditures? Naught other than a suicidal lust for military power.
Naught other than the infatuation of the dizzy, competitive war dance
of mutual destruction&mdash;each nation blindly driven by all, and all by
each.</p>

<p>We as Americans profess to find in the conduct of Russia, in the
militarism of England and Germany and France, examples of militarism
run rampant. How our hearts have warmed within us when we have thought
of our own republic as the happy envied nation, free from the burden
of militarism! Our farmer has gone singing about his work, apparently
not having to carry on his back a soldier, as does the European peasant.
Our mechanic has freely plied his trade without thought of supporting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Page 59]</a></span>
a sailor. Yet how can we say that the United States in buying
battleships and erecting coast defenses, in arming her soldiers with
Krag-J&ouml;rgensens, has not been deprived of schools, colleges, and
opportunities essential to happiness and prosperity? In a decade we
have spent nearly a billion dollars on our navy alone. Yes, we have
aped the military fashions of Europe and have set a new standard of
military waste.</p>

<p>Verily our national advancement waits on militarism. Inland waterways
should be improved; forests must be safeguarded; other natural
resources of untold value should be conserved; millions of acres of
desert lands should be improved; millions in swamps should be
redeemed. The problem of the nation's food supply is becoming urgent;
for its solution we must look more and more to scientific methods in
agriculture. Yet contrast the support our government gives these vital
interests with war's mighty drain on our treasury. Congress
appropriated $648,000,000 for all expenditures in 1910. Of this amount
$407,000,000 were appropriated for war expenditures and the glories of
militarism. For this same year agriculture received for all its needs
the comparatively paltry sum of $12,000,000. In spite of the fact that
our nation is devoting two thirds of its enormous national
expenditures to war, our militarists point to our vast national wealth
and sneer at the niggardly mortals who object to spending it for guns.</p>

<p>It is evident that no nation is yet beyond the infatuation for display
of the splendors of war, yet in every one there are signs of a new
power that is coming upon us. All are thinking less of the glories of
war&mdash;of the beat of the drum, of the rhythmic tread of regiments, of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Page 60]</a></span>
glittering sabers and of monster battleships&mdash;and are thinking more
and more of the glories of peace, of thriving industries, of
magnificent libraries, of comfortable homes, and of more efficient
schools. Obviously, though we still possess a war spirit, we are
seeing with a clearer vision that the waste of war is depriving us of
the fullest measure of the wealth of peace. Our frame of mind is much
the same as that of the ragged street urchin who, having lost his
day's earnings, thinks of a hundred things which he might have spent
it for. The same spirit is permeating every nation. The American
manufacturer, the Russian peasant, the English mechanic, the German
scientist, the French scholar, are all asking themselves, "Why need
the world continue to carry this Atlantean burden of war?"</p>

<p>Already this sentiment has accomplished practically all that can be
done in humanizing war. It has outlawed the dumdum bullet, it has
enforced radical sanitary measures, it has neutralized the Red Cross
and brought its ministrations to the relief of the sufferings of war.
But humanized war is not the goal of this sentiment. As long as there
is an increase of armaments there will be war; as long as the battle
rages there will be waste and suffering. The same sentiment which has
humanized war now demands war's abolition. It has already accomplished
something toward this end in making the settlement of international
disputes through arbitration more probable than war. What it
has not accomplished is the discrediting of militarism. It has
failed to stop the growth of armaments. Can we expect our
regiments to find contentment in the irksome routine of training
camp with never a thought of charging the enemy? Can we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Page 61]</a></span>
expect to man the seas with fleets of war just for gay parade and
cruises around the world? Can we expect that our skilled gunners will
be satisfied to practice, practice always, and never long for human
targets? It is against arming nations for battle and tempting them to
fight that the peace sentiment is rousing itself and is being organized.
It is in this labor that peace societies the world over are performing
valiant service. Their great mission is the creation of an intelligent
public opinion, a force more potent than government itself.</p>

<p>What, for instance, was the purpose of the founder of this
Intercollegiate Peace Association? Not, I take it, to give men a
chance to win petty oratorical triumphs; not, I suppose, to bring
together speakers to entertain such audiences as this&mdash;or to weary
them. But their object must have been to set the men of our colleges
to thinking on the great question of peace. In such ways are peace
societies using the platform and the press to establish a firm basis
for unity and peace throughout the world.</p>

<p>Yesterday the advocate of world peace was called a dreamer; to-day
rapidly organizing public opinion demands the abolition of war and
recognizes the wealth and culture of peace. Yesterday we erected
statues to those who died for their country; to-day we cheer the
Gladstones, the McKinleys, the Roosevelts, who live for humanity.
Yesterday we bowed the knee to Mars; to-day we join in peans to the
Prince of Peace. Yes, the new spirit of the day is fraternal; it is
undaunted; it is for mankind. Even now the world's geniuses are
mustering the soldier citizens of every nation for a peaceful
conflict. The great battles of to-morrow are to be fought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Page 62]</a></span>
in quiet laboratories, in legislative halls, in courts of justice,
and on the broad battlefields of productive labor.</p>

<p>The final outcome is, indeed, irresistible. Racial movements have
mixed all peoples; the oceans have become the world's common highways;
the air is filled with voices speaking from city to city and from
continent to continent; an international postal system makes the
world's ideas one; there is quick participation of mankind in the
fruits of invention and research. We behold financial and economic
enterprises world-wide in their outreach; we feel the force of social
projects and social ideals that concern not one but every nation; and
we are participating in missionary movements that affect not one but
every race, and are changing the very face of nature itself. Our world
is a world unified beyond all possible conception a century ago, and
the world unity is a certain stepping stone to world peace.</p>

<p>The world never offered grander opportunity to the nations for
leadership&mdash;not for leadership in military splendor, but for
leadership in the sublime paths of peace. For the United States this
call means not only opportunity but even obligation. Already this
country has performed well her duty in fostering international
arbitration. She has been a party to half of the cases where
disputes between nations have been referred to the Hague Tribunal.
Arbitration is performing its mission with more and more efficiency,
yet each year the war budgets of the nations are increasing. The
peace sentiment now demands a decrease of armaments, a conversion
of the waste of war into the wealth of peace. To demonstrate that
this is practicable is the immediate opportunity before us,
our present obligation. What is our waste of war expressed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Page 63]</a></span>
in terms of the wealth of peace? Notice! Two thirds of the cost of one
dreadnought, like the mammoth <i>Florida</i> launched but yesterday, would
erect and furnish a veritable palace for every foreign ambassador and
minister of the United States, thus solving a perplexing problem of
our diplomatic service. One twenty-second of the cost of one
dreadnought would support for one year the entire force of the
American Board of Foreign Missions in their work of proclaiming our
gospel of peace. One half the cost of one dreadnought would erect and
equip twenty-five manual-training schools, teaching the rudiments of a
trade to forty thousand young people each year. The cost of two
dreadnoughts would provide every state in the Union with a
half-million dollars with which to save the juvenile delinquents from
criminal courts and schools of vice behind prison bars. The cost of
one dreadnought, wisely spent each year in the fight against
tuberculosis, would make the white plague in a single generation a
disease as rare as smallpox is to-day.</p>

<p>Where now we are erecting battleships and forts, it is for us to build
libraries and schools. Where now we drain our treasuries in equipping
men to fight their fellow men, it is for us to arm against the common
enemy, disease. Where now we pour out our wealth before the pagan
Mars, it is for us to devote our treasure to supporting the works of
the Prince of Peace.</p>

<p>Such a victory for peace would make America not simply a world
power: it would make her the world leader. Will we stop tagging
at the heels of Great Britain and Germany and travel this broadening
road in which we can be first? How humiliating to struggle along,
a trailer in the military procession! How noble to set the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Page 64]</a></span>
daring example of living up to the belief in peace! Will we say: "See
our hands; we bear no bludgeons. Search us; we carry no concealed
weapons. Militarism we have thrown to the scrap heap of practices
discredited and vicious. We have stopped war's wanton waste of men and
treasure; we rejoice in the growing wealth of peace ideals realized"?
Thus shall we speed the steadily growing public opinion of the world,
to the bar of which must finally come every nation which does aught to
break or hinder the world's peace.</p>

<h2>THE HOPE OF PEACE</h2>


<p>The history of civilization is a record of changing
ideals, and ideals are best reared in the hearts of the
world's young men. Inevitably, nations look toward the
cradle for their future and intrust the care of their destiny
to the hands of youth. "Tell me what are the prevailing
sentiments that occupy the minds of your young
men," declared Edmund Burke, "and I will tell you what
is to be the character of the next generation." When the
blood of youth is sluggish and impure; when the young
hold wealth more dear than worth, remove the check of
virtue from their selfish aims, establish Mammon as their
god, and, ambitious to govern the world, forget how to
govern themselves,&mdash;then nations choke and die. But
when the blood of youth is rich and pure, pulsating
through the veins of the universe with strong, resistless
surge; when fathers teach anew the angel's message of
good will and peace, and sons build high their goal upon
a pedestal of service and of truth,&mdash;then nations breathe
and live. What hope, then, asks the world, finds the doctrine
of peace in the ideals and aspirations of America's
youth to-day?</p>

<p>The nation faces a charge of militarism. It is the indictment
of her critics that never before in American history
has the government entertained an attitude so hostile
toward her neighbors and so dangerous to the interests of
peace. They point to the attempt to fortify the Canal and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Page 68]</a></span>
cry out that America would drain her treasury to build a
monument of reproach to international integrity. They
criticize the vast appropriations for the navy and declare
that America is starving her poor that she may more
pompously parade the seas. They protest against the
"war-game" on the Rio Grande<a name="FNanchor_1_9" id="FNanchor_1_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_9" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and even charge that
in the interest of a Wall Street king America invites the
world to arms. And these are not illusions. The lure of
gold has turned the nation from her mission. The spirit
of commercialism has eclipsed the sentiment of brotherhood
and tempted the Republic to barter her honor for
the price of imperial supremacy. Wherein, then, again
asks the world, finds America hope for the future? And
to the charges of her critics, with their dismal prophecy
of a "wrong forever on the throne," this is the nation's
answer and defense&mdash;that an eclipse is never permanent,
that the world stays not in the valley of the shadow
forever, and that the solution of the problem, the fulfillment
of a national mission, and the hope of world peace
find their common assurance in the changing ideals of
America's aspiring young men.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_9" id="Footnote_1_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_9"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
Part of the United States army was mobilized on the frontier for maneuvers,
in 1911, owing to the Mexican revolutionary disturbances.&mdash;<i>Editor.</i></p></div>

<p>The young American is essentially ambitious. He is
wont to seek the shortest path to leadership, and, when
blocked at one highway, to turn with undiminished ardor
to another. And his ideal is a mirror of the age in which
he lives. In revolutionary days he covets the glory of
a minuteman, and in the deeds of Warren and Putnam
finds the consummation of his hopes. Again, in the
hour of civil war his eyes turn toward the battlefield&mdash;and
from her boys under twenty-one the Union draws
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Page 69]</a></span>
eighty-five per cent of her defenders. But fortunately
for America this drama of the youth's ideal has one more
act. The lure of fife and drum has become a thing of the
past. The glamour of military life has become a dream of
yesterday. The young man is learning that the prize of
battle is never equal to the price. And with the growing
conviction of the folly and futility of international
strife must disappear the last apology for war. Nations
will cease to struggle, not when they have learned that
war is a tragedy but when they have discovered that it
is a farce.</p>

<p>And the youth of to-day is learning it. In the same
deplorable conditions which the nation's critics have regarded
as an alarming tendency toward militarism, he
reads a message of the absurdity of war. Militarism
itself is revealing a mission. Based as it is on the spirit
of aggrandizement, it is teaching to youth the economic
value of a human life. It is uncovering its own selfish
motives and betraying its own senseless ends. It is impressing
the world with the truth that battles are fought
for purse string and not for principle. It is teaching to
youth a new ideal; it is itself the answer to complaints
of friends and calumnies of foes. It is the cloud before
the dawn. It heralds the coming of the brightest epoch
yet chronicled in American history. It is the realization
of that glorious prophecy of John Hay that the time is
coming when "the clangor of arms shall cease, and we
can fancy that at last our ears, no longer stunned by
the din of armies, may hear the morning stars singing
together and all the sons of God shouting for joy."</p>

<p>And is this but the dream of a visionary? Is it merely
the fancied perception of an inexistent star? Is it nothing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Page 70]</a></span>
more than a groundless hope and an alluring vagary?
The answer is visible everywhere. And the hope of peace
finds its safest assurance among the institutions of learning
in America. James Bryce has referred to the United
States as the nation having the largest proportion of its
young men in college. In the last month of June more
than fifty thousand collegians wore the cap and gown of
graduation. It is to the trust of the college-bred man that
the peace movement confides its future, and modern education
assumes no greater responsibility than the training
of the new world-citizen. Already the school has become
the most potent factor in the new uplift. The youth is no
longer dependent upon the newspaper for his knowledge
of world-politics. An intelligent study of foreign affairs
is at last regarded as of as much importance as a study
of the past. To broaden the young man's vision of the
world, prominent educators are even advocating traveling
fellowships. In twenty-five of the larger universities
of America an association of Cosmopolitan Clubs is
establishing the groundworks for a wider international
fraternity. Plans are already under way to have an
organized delegation of more than a hundred students of
all nationalities present at the third Hague Conference.
Day by day the problem of world-unity is becoming more
and more deeply embedded in the mind and thought of
the rising generation. More and more is youthful patriotism
becoming a realization of the truth that "Above all
nations is humanity." The lure of war is losing its magnetic
power and the brotherhood of man becoming more
and more an international reality. A sentiment for universal
peace is sweeping the world, and behind the defenses
of advancing civilization, armed with the strength
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Page 71]</a></span>
of a lofty and unselfish purpose, stands an army of
America's young men, mustered from the nation's colleges,
enlisted to serve for an eternity, and invulnerable
in the protection of a new and a conquering ideal.</p>

<p>Therefore the significance of the young man in the
world's affairs to-day is something more than a fancy.
Again and again the plea for world-harmony hears a
response in the changing ideals of a new generation. The
growing sentiment of the educated youth of Japan finds
its crystallization in the efforts of Count Okuma toward
the consummation of world-disarmament. The spirit of
the youth of England finds expression in the ambitious
dream of George V, whose hope it is to tie the bond of
Anglo-Saxon unity, long since dissevered by George III.
Among the young men of Russia the life of the great
philosopher of world-citizenship has left a lasting conviction
of the senselessness of war. Even in imperialistic
Germany the reckless building of dreadnoughts brings out
a vigorous and uncompromising protest from the thinking
youth of the land. In America a vision of the international
parliament of man, growing large in the minds
of her leading statesmen, finds expression in the continued
philanthropy of a great industrial king. And,
most significant of all, these are the world-wide examples
that the college man enthrones in the empire of his
thoughts. Sixty thousand European students, bound together
by the cosmopolitan ties of a peace fraternity, have
ceased to glorify the triumphs of the battlefield. The commentaries
of the hero-worshiper to-day do not record the
names of a Marlborough or a Bonaparte. Rather does
the young man find his idols in the more humble annals
of a Tolstoy or a Hay. And the new ideal of international
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Page 72]</a></span>
peace is not merely the religion of a few enthusiasts. In
an individual way these apostles of peace voice to the
world the spirit of the unnumbered thousands of obscurer
men whose lives and talents are directed, not to the construction
of material kingdoms but to the building of a
better and more world-wide brotherhood.</p>

<p>Such is the Hope of Peace. The nation's critics may
continue their indictment, and, pointing out the crises
of the hour, paint in dismal hues a picture of the problems
never to be solved except by shot and shell. Her
skeptics, blinded by thought of the errors of the past,
may prophesy the desecration of her honor and the disappointing
failure of her hopes. The press may pen a
graphic story of the military spirit of the age, and frowning
patriarchs relate the deeds of golden days gone by.
But underneath this cloud that overhangs, and almost
hidden in the gloom of history's disparagement, the new
world-citizen discerns the birth-light of a brighter and
more steadfast star,&mdash;perceives the coming triumph of
good will and peace,&mdash;and the awakened eyes of expectant
America look forward with promise to the dawn
of that new day when a nation shall be judged by the
weight of its cross and not by the wealth of its crown.</p>

<h2>THE ROOSEVELT THEORY OF WAR</h2>


<p>Ex-President Roosevelt has made this astounding
statement, "By war alone can we acquire those virile
qualities necessary to win in the stern strife of actual
life." These words, coming from the lips of a nation's
idol, have fallen like a bomb shell in the camp of the
pacifists. Not that Mr. Roosevelt's opinion was of overwhelming
weight, but that he was voicing the opinion
of some of the most influential thinkers of the modern
world. Not long before the German philosopher Nietzsche
had taken a like position, and he was indorsed by Von
Moltke, the statesman; Ernest Renan, the historian;
Hegel, the philosopher; Charles Kingsley and Canon
Farrar, the divines. We must have a care, we peace
advocates, how we treat such men's opinions. If they
are right; if, as they maintain, war develops a nation,
then we are fighting against the instrument of our own
salvation and smothering the only hope of the nation
itself.</p>

<p>But are they right? Does war make for national greatness?
Before we can give a rational verdict we must
answer certain other questions. What is our nation, anyway?
What are the factors that make for its greatness?
And how does war affect these factors?</p>

<p>Plainly our nation is not some abstraction that haunts
the marble halls at Washington. Nor is it our vast dominion
on which, like England's, the sun never sets. You
will find it rather in workshop and store and factory;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Page 76]</a></span>
it is no more nor less than our men. If the capital at
Washington is founded on pygmy manhood, it will be
blown away like thistledown before some passing wind of
revolution. Russia, Turkey, Spain, will tell you that. If
our men are giants, the nation will be lasting as adamant.
England and Germany and America are monumental
testimonies.</p>

<p>Now what are the qualities in our men that make
the nation great?</p>

<p>Here a problem in analysis confronts us. Let us go
about it as does the student in the laboratory. He dissects
a plant or mineral to find the mysteries of its nature.
We are to dissect a civilization to find the factors of its
strength. One little specimen will reveal the secrets of
the whole species. So one sample of civilization will show
the hidden springs of all. Go with me to the public
square of any modern city and there you will behold the
qualities that build all civilization. From the hum and
rattle and roar that rises from the sea of humanity come
a thousand various voices, but all speak of one theme&mdash;industry.
There in the center of the throng and press
a slender monument rises, crowned perhaps with a figure
of Liberty or Justice. It tells you a simple story of
Idealism. Yonder stands a silent, vine-clad church,
crowned by a mighty finger pointing heavenward and
beckoning always to the higher life. What need of going
farther? Industry, Idealism, Morality&mdash;already we have
found the secret of human success, the triple key to all
advance, of man or group or nation. Here is Carlyle, with
his gospel of labor, the labor that conquers all things;
here is Ruskin, with his exalting idealism, that gives an
aim and purpose to all human toil; here is the great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Page 77]</a></span>
apostle Paul himself, who transfigures that toil and
exalts that purpose with his everlasting gospel of moral
sublimity. Here is our threefold criterion, by which every
nation must stand or fall. The Anglo-Saxon is what he
is through unceasing industry, perpetual aspiration, and
moral strength. The Central African is what he is through
inbred sluggishness, total lack of purpose, and almost total
absence of morality.</p>

<p>These are the basic elements of national greatness. But
the great question still remains, How does war affect
them?</p>

<p>Concerning the effect of war on labor, we declare unhesitatingly
that the two are everlasting foes, and that
whenever War lays hands on Labor's throat, it strangles
her. This is part of the inevitable program of war, for
note that it is on the laboring men that the dreadful
claims of war must fall. Mark its course. A bugle sounds
the call to arms. From workshop, mill, and factory the
laborers pour forth; out go the men into a trade where
plunder and robbery are a means of livelihood; when
pillage and slaughter wane, indolence becomes the order
of the day; commerce degenerates into blockade-running
by sea and marauding by land. How tame the life of
peace to this wild life of war! And all the time the love
of toil is fading from men's minds; at home the factory
wheels are turning more and more feebly, and when at
last the sword is laid aside, there is only "confusion
worse confounded," for the channels of labor are choked
with men reared in habits of indolence or trained in the
school of vice. Before the scar on that nation's industry
can finally be healed, decades and perhaps centuries of
peace must pass away.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Page 78]</a></span>
But if war is a scar on the nation's industry, it is likewise
a blot on her ideals. Though this element of idealism
at first seems visionary and impractical, it is one of the
foundation stones of progress. The fixed gulf between
what man is and what he knows he might be is the
decisive factor in his advance. Ideals are the pulleys of
the unseen, round which man throws his hopes and aims,
by which he pulls himself across the chasm and into the
larger life. To advance at all, man must have ideals&mdash;for
himself, for his family, for his nation. But mark the effect
of war on these ideals. In place of the ideal of peace&mdash;to
serve men and uplift them&mdash;one is taught the ideal of war&mdash;to
make himself the most widely feared of professional
murderers. Instead of the ideal of peace&mdash;to make his
family comfortable, happy, and prosperous&mdash;comes in the
war ideal, by whose terms the family head deserts his
own flock to kill other family heads for the eternal glory
of the Stars and Stripes. As for his ideal of the nation's
greatness, we have ample testimony that when bullets
and cannon balls cone crashing through the <ins class="correction" title="original reads 'spendid'">splendid</ins>
structure of his purpose, it speedily crumbles into an
ignominious desire to hide himself behind the nearest
tree. No; do not say that war builds up ideals; it tears
them down and tramples them in the dust; aye more, it
sets back crime itself where they should rightly stand.</p>

<p>But if war so dethrones a nation's ideals, what may it
not do to a nation's morality? Imagine if you can a million
men, the core of the national power, turning themselves
into machines to carry out blindly the schemes
of leaders who may be right or wrong; schooled in the
belief that manslaughter is manliness, that the rash
courage of the brute is above the moral courage of a man;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Page 79]</a></span>
forgetful of the meaning of human life; thoughtless of a
thing so common as death; heedless of its eternal consequences.
No wonder Channing cried so bitterly: "War
is the concentration of all human crimes. Under its standard
gather violence, malignity, rage, fraud, rapacity, and
lust. If it only slew men, it would do little. But it turns
man into a beast of prey. Here is the evil of war, that
man, made to be the brother, becomes the deadly foe of
his kind; that man, whose duty is to mitigate suffering,
makes the infliction of suffering his study and end."</p>

<p>No, Mr. Roosevelt, for once at least you are wrong!
We cannot believe that war builds up a nation. Rather
will we believe those words of Herbert Spencer, more
sweeping but far more true, "Advance to the highest
forms of man and society depends on the decline of
militancy and the growth of industrialism."</p>

<p>"But wait," you say; "all this is theory and abstraction.
We want matters of fact. Your case may be true
as philosophy, but you have failed to ground it in example."
So it is to history that our last appeal must be
made, for, says Bolingbroke, "History is philosophy,
teaching by example." Every decree of her stern tribunal
is impartial and irrevocable. War the tonic or war the
poison? She is the final judge. She will take you back, if
you will, to her childhood days and point you out vast empires,
owning the known world, Babylonians, Assyrians,
Egyptians, Medes, and Persians, fearful fighters all of
them. But no, not quite all either. On a sandy stretch of
seashore, half hidden by the unwieldy empires around it,
we see a timid, peaceful little people called the Hebrews;
they alone, from all that mighty company, have stood the
"wreckful siege" of thirty centuries. Watch its sinister
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Page 80]</a></span>
movement down the ages and you will see the war cloud
hover over Greece, and her republics melt to nothing in
disunion and decay. It hovers over the Huns, and they
suddenly sink from sight; over Islam, and its civilization
crumbles faster than it grew; over Spain, and all the
New World treasures cannot save her from decay. Finally,
like the cloud no bigger than a hand, it rises from
the island of Corsica and moves toward Central Europe.
All too well does Europe know its meaning. From north
and south, from east and west, she pours into the field the
finest armies that the Old World ever saw. Then she
pauses. Europe grows tense with a nameless dread. The
storm cloud blackens, hovers lower, then bursts with all
its fury through the continent. For ten long years, at the
command of an imperial butcher, the soil is drenched with
blood, the sky grows lurid from burning Paris to burning
Moscow, three million homes are draped in black. Grand,
indeed, and glorious! But Europe lost more than her
gorgeous standards, more than her ruined cities; she left
her manhood on those bloody fields.</p>

<p>We might extend the awful picture, but the story is
the same, dread tale of death for nations as for men. Is
not this enough? Is it not clear that this traitor to
labor, this despoiler of ideals, this foe to morality, is not
the benefactor but the destroyer of nations? And shall
we not "here highly resolve" no longer to walk in this
"valley of the shadow of death," but to hasten toward the
dawning of a brighter, purer day? For in spite of pessimism,
in spite of scholarship, in spite of history, the day is</p>

<h2>NATIONAL HONOR AND VITAL INTERESTS</h2>


<p>The day for deprecating in general terms the evils of
war and of extolling the glories of peace is past. Such
argument is little needed. International trade requires
peace. International finance dictates peace. Even armies
and navies are now justified primarily as agents of peace.
Yet so wantonly are these agents looting the world's treasuries
that they are themselves forcing their own displacement
by courts of arbitration. The two hundred and
fifty disputes successfully arbitrated in the past century
challenge with trumpet-tongued eloquence the support
of all men for reason's peaceful rule. To-day no discussion
is needed to show that if war is to be abolished, if
navies are to dwindle and armies diminish, if there is
to be a federation of the world, it must come through
treaties of arbitration. In this way alone lies peace; yet
in this way lies the present great barrier to further
progress&mdash;the conception which many nations, especially
the United States, hold of "national honor and vital
interests." The reservation from arbitration of so-called
matters of national honor and vital interests constitutes
the weak link in every existing arbitration treaty between
the great powers of the world. This reservation furnishes
the big-navy men all the argument they need. It
destroys the binding power of the treaties by allowing
either party to any dispute to refuse arbitration. It was
by this reservation that the United States Senate so lately
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Page 84]</a></span>
killed the British and the French treaties. And I contend
here to-night that the one subject which imperatively demands
discussion is national honor and vital interests.
That the next important step must be the exposure of
the reactionary influence of the United States in excepting
these matters from arbitration.</p>

<p>Only fifteen months ago President Taft made his memorable
declaration that this barrier ought to be removed
from the pathway of peace. He proposed that the United
States negotiate new treaties to abide by the adjudication
of courts in every international issue which could not be
settled by negotiation, whether involving honor or territory
or money. The next morning the proposal was
heralded by the press throughout the world. A few days
later the halls of Parliament resounded with applause
when Great Britain's secretary of state for foreign affairs
announced that his government would welcome such a
treaty with the United States. France soon followed.
Then, to the surprise of all, hesitating Germany and
cautious Japan showed a like willingness to enter into
such agreements. Universal peace seemed all but realized.</p>

<p>The cause was at once borne up on a mighty wave
of public opinion. The peace societies were in a frenzy
of activity. Mass meetings of indorsement were held in
England and America. Editorials of approval appeared
in all parts of the world. The movement was now irresistible.
Within eight months the British and the French
treaties were drafted. Three of the greatest nations of
the world were at last to commit themselves unreservedly
to the cause of international peace. Even disputes involving
national honor should not halt the beneficent
work of high courts of law and of reason. The day when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Page 85]</a></span>
the treaties were signed, August 3, 1911, was hailed as
a red-letter day in the annals of the civilized world. It
was proclaimed the dawn of a new and auspicious era in
the affairs of men and of nations.</p>

<p>During all the months preceding the action of the
Senate on these treaties the only statesman of any prominence
to raise his voice in opposition was ex-President
Theodore Roosevelt. The gist of his successive and violent
attacks on the treaties is contained in this utterance,
which I quote, "It would be not merely foolish but
wicked for us as a nation to agree to arbitrate any dispute
that affects our vital interests or our independence
or our honor." In this spirit, to the surprise and disappointment
of the whole nation, the Senate amended the
treaties out of their original intent, and placed upon them
limitations that defeated their purpose. By the Senate's
action the United States is still committed to the pretense
that there may be occasion for a just and solemn
war, that vital interests and national honor may force
us to fight.</p>

<p>What, then, are the vital interests that can be conserved
only by saber and bullet? Nothing more, nothing
less, according to various acknowledged authorities, than
a state's independence and its territorial integrity. Did
the keen mind of our former president really foresee the
seizure of some of our territory by England or France?
Yet he protests it that it would be "not merely foolish but
wicked for us as a nation to agree to arbitrate any dispute
that affects our vital interests." Did Senator Lodge
and his threescore colleagues who amended the treaties
actually fear an attempt to overthrow our form of government,
to destroy our political institutions, or to take
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Page 86]</a></span>
away those individual rights and sacred privileges upon
which our government was founded? Yet to save us
from such fate they refused unlimited arbitration.</p>

<p>For the United States to except from arbitration her
vital interests is obvious pretense. To add thereto her
national honor is extreme hypocrisy. What is national
honor? No man knows. It is one thing to-day; another,
to-morrow. It may involve an indemnity claim, a boundary
line, a fisheries dispute. In fact, any controversy may
be declared by either party, at will, to be a question of
national honor. Thus in the hands of an unskilled or
malicious diplomacy, any question which was originally
a judicial one may become a question of national honor.
What, then, will we arbitrate? Every case in which a
favorable award is assured us. If we want Texas, we
send an army after it. Every case that does not rouse
our anger. Let the <i>Maine</i> blow up and we fight. A treaty
with an elastic exception like this is a farcical sham and
a delusion.</p>

<p>It is high time the true and humiliating significance
of these fearsome phrases should be as familiar to every
taxpayer as is the burden of bristling camps and restless
navies. Read the record of Great Britain's first offer of
unlimited arbitration in the Olney-Pauncefote treaty of
1897. There, too, you will find national honor and vital
interests clogging the machinery of universal peace. By
these same exceptions the Senate emasculated that treaty
and defeated the spirit of the agreement. Is it conceivable
that the Senate actually feared that our interests
would be imperiled by that treaty? Did it delve out
some hidden dangers which escaped the careful scrutiny
of both the English and American embassies, some peril
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Page 87]</a></span>
unforeseen by the keen judicial mind of President Cleveland,
who characterized the defeat of the treaty as "the
greatest grief" of his administration.</p>

<p>But this is not all. The American representatives at
both Hague Conferences were the first to place these
same limitations on all arbitration proposals.</p>

<p>Look at it from what point of view you will, our government's
conduct must appear humiliating. Considering
the fact that universal arbitration treaties have proved
practical, it is well-nigh incredible. Behold our bellicose
sister American republics. Argentina and Chile, Brazil
and Argentina, Bolivia and Peru, all have agreements
for the arbitration of all questions whatsoever. All the
Central American republics are bound by treaty to decide
every difference of whatever nature in the Central American
Court of Justice. Denmark's three treaties with Italy,
Portugal, and the Netherlands withhold no cause, however
vital, from reason's peaceful sway. Norway and
Sweden likewise have an agreement to abide by the decision
of the Hague Court in whatever disputes may
occur. The very existence of all these treaties is significant,
yet even more significant is the fact that they have
been triumphantly tested. Norway and Sweden at one
extremity of the globe and Argentina and Chile at the
other have thus quietly settled disputes in which their
honor and interests were seriously involved.</p>

<p>Do you ask further evidence of the hypocrisy with
which our Senate parades our national honor and our
vital interests to the undoing of a grand work? Search
our history and you will find it in abundance. In the
great case of the Alabama claims, Charles Francis Adams
pronounced the construction of Confederate ships in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Page 88]</a></span>
English ports to be a violation of the international law
of neutrality. This certainly was a question of national
honor and vital interests, yet he pleaded for arbitration.
In reply Lord John Russell said, "That is a question of
honor which we will never arbitrate, for England's honor
cannot be made the subject of arbitration." The case
was debated for six years. Then came England's "Grand
Old Man," the mighty Gladstone, with a different view.
"It is to the interest," he said, "not only of England and
the United States, but of the world, peaceably to settle
those claims." He submitted them to a joint high commission.
England lost and paid. Thus the honor of both
nations was successfully arbitrated. Likewise the Newfoundland
fisheries case had been a bone of contention
between Great Britain and America from the day our
independence was recognized. As late as 1887 it threatened
to become the cause of war. No question ever arose
which more vitally affected the interests of America, yet
the Senate recently accepted a settlement by arbitration.
Similarly, the Alaska fur seal dispute, the Alaskan and
the Venezuelan boundary disputes, and the northeast
boundary controversy all involved both the vital interests
and the national honor of England and America, yet
all were satisfactorily and permanently arbitrated. So
excited were we over our northwest boundary that the
principal issue of a political campaign was "The whole
of Oregon or none! Fifty-four forty or fight!" Yet we
peaceably acquiesced in a treaty that gave us neither.</p>

<p>Yes, our honor may be arbitrated. If we are ill-prepared
for war, we arbitrate. If we are sure of a
favorable award, we arbitrate. But we must have a
loophole, an ever-ready escape from obligation. Posing
as the most enlightened nation on the face of the globe,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Page 89]</a></span>
we refuse entirely to displace those medieval notions
according to which personal honor found its best protection
in the dueling pistol, and national honor its only
vindication in slaughter and devastation. To unlimited
arbitration we refuse to submit.</p>

<p>Fifteen years ago England, the mighty England, gave
us her pledge that no cause should ever justify war. This
pledge our Senate in the name of honor refused. Unlimited
arbitration agreements were suggested at both
Hague Conferences. Americans promptly placed restrictions
upon them in the name of honor. Again has England
with enthusiasm just offered us unrestricted arbitration.
Again she is repulsed by our Senate in the name of
honor. France, too, bears to our doors an unqualified
pledge of arbitration. France, too, is repulsed by our
Senate in the name of honor. Germany and Japan express
a desire to settle every question at the bar of justice.
Impelled by honor we pass their desire unheeded.
Our Clevelands, our Olneys, our Edward Everett Hales,
our Carl Schurzes, our John Hays, have all urged unlimited
arbitration. Our Davises and Clarks and Platts
and Quays in Senate seats have undone their work in
the name of honor. Our Charles Eliots and Nicholas
Butlers, our Albert Shaws and Hamilton Holts, now
plead for universal peace through unlimited arbitration.
Senators Bacon and Lodge and Heyburn and Hitchcock,
apparently impelled by constitutional prerogative, party
prejudice, or personal animosity, now cast their votes for
limitations in the name of honor. From the platform of
peace conferences, from the halls of colleges, from the
pulpit and the bench, from the offices of bankers and
merchants and manufacturers, from the press, with
scarcely a column's exception, there arises a swelling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Page 90]</a></span>
plea for treaties of arbitration that know no exceptions.
In the name of honor that plea is defied.</p>

<p>Honor? No, an ocean of exception large enough to
float any number of battleships for which pride and ambition
may be willing to pay! Honor? No, a finical and
foolish reservation that at any moment may become a
maelstrom of suspicion and rage and hatred and destruction
and death! Honor? No, a mountainous barrier to
peace that must be leveled before there can be progress!
Honor? No, the incarnation of selfishness, the cloak of
shrewd politics, the mask of false patriotism! National
honor? No, national dishonor!</p>

<p>Before the nations of the world the United States
stands to-day in an unenviable light. It is a false light.
Since the days of William Penn and Benjamin Franklin
our people have led in much of the march upward from
the slough of weltering strife. Many a <ins class="correction" title="original has 'stumblingblock'">stumbling block</ins>
to progress we have removed from the rugged pathway,
but for fifteen years our government has refused to touch
the barrier of national honor and vital interests. England
and France have now laid this duty squarely at our door.
"It is a social obligation as imperative as the law of
Moses, as full of hope as the Great Physician's healing
touch." Let us here highly resolve that there shall be
uttered a new official interpretation of national honor and
vital interests, an interpretation synonymous with dignity
and fidelity, sincerity, and integrity, and confidence in the
vows both of men and of nations. "If we have 'faith
in the right as God gives us to see the right,' we shall
catch a vision of opportunity that shall fire the soul with
a spirit of service which the darkness of night shall not
arrest, which the course of the day shall not weary."</p>

<h2>THE EVOLUTION OF PATRIOTISM</h2>


<p>Robert Southey has asked through the lips of a little
child the greatest peace question that the world has
known. He pictures a summer evening on the old battlefield
of Blenheim. On a chair before his vine-clad cottage
sat old Kaspar while his grandchildren, Wilhelmine and
Peterkin, played on the lawn. Suddenly Peterkin from
a nearby brook unearthed a skull and, running, brought
it to Kaspar's knee. The old man took the gruesome
thing from the boy, and told him that this had been the
head of a man killed in the great battle of Blenheim.
Then little Wilhelmine looked up into her grandfather's
face and said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"Now tell us all about the war,<br />
And what they fought each other for."<br />
</p></div>

<p>Here we have the central question in the problem of
war. Why do men fight? Through the answer to that
question lies the path to world-peace.</p>

<p>Few men fight to-day for glory. Modern militarism
has no place for Lancelots and Galahads. The glory of
the regiment has absorbed the glory of the individual.
Few men fight to-day to gain great wealth. The treasures
that glittered before Pizarro do not tempt our soldiers.
Material wealth is more easily won in factory or
farm or mill. Few men fight to-day for religion. The
conquest of religion has become a conquest of peace;
the very ideal of peace is an end of religion itself. Glory,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Page 94]</a></span>
wealth, religion&mdash;these are no longer the causes of war.
Then why do men fight? The answer is obvious. Men
fight to-day for patriotism. Patriotism is the cause of war.</p>

<p>The next step in our reasoning is more difficult. If
patriotism is the cause of war, how shall we treat the
cause to destroy the result? Shall we attempt to abolish
patriotism as Tolstoy would have us do, or shall we try
to change its nature so that war as a natural result will
be impossible? To answer these questions we must
study patriotism from its very beginnings. We must
ask: What is patriotism? Where did it come from?
What place has it in our life?</p>

<p>Observe first the simplest cell of life, the am&#339;ba. We
can watch it through the microscope. It is so tiny that
it keeps house in a drop of water. It has neither emotion
nor consciousness, in the human sense. It lives a while,
and then splits in two to form other cells that have no
connection with each other. Yet this infinitesimal bit of
life has an instinct, the instinct to save itself. Watch an
am&#339;ba as fire is brought near. It immediately moves
away. Its every act is regulated by this one instinct,
self-preservation.</p>

<p>Now let us leave the microscope and go outdoors.
Over there is a bird in a tree top, feeding its young in
a nest. Suppose that a fire should suddenly consume
the tree. Would the mother bird fly away in safety?
No, it would die on its nest in the effort to save its
young. There is more than self-preservation here. The
scientist will tell you that the instinct has expanded to
include the preservation of the offspring.</p>

<p>And now turn to primitive man. The recent excavations
in Sussex will give us a picture of him. He is a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Page 95]</a></span>
wild, gorilla-like figure that creeps beneath the trees.
He can leap with lightning force on his prey. He drapes
his body with bearskins, and eats meat from fingers
that end in claws. And yet with all his savage ferocity,
this is more than an animal. This is a man. In his breast
there stir the instincts of a man. In his life we see the
vital element of patriotism, love. His little savage family
is more precious to him than all the world. He will fight
and die, not only for self-preservation but for those
who to him are "brother and sister and mother." This
is the stamp of the human. This is the potentially divine.</p>

<p>But as the storms of war beat about these little savage
families, the sense of common danger welded them into
one. Out of grim necessity friendship came, and friendship
gave birth to patriotism. Loyalty and sacrifice were
not limited to the family; men fought and died for
their tribe.</p>

<p>And now let us turn the microscope upon ourselves.
We would fight for our country. We say because we
love our country. We call that feeling patriotism. It is
more extended than the savage love of tribe; it gives
loyalty to a great government and democratic principles.
We speak of that feeling as divine, but it is terribly
human. Its expression is the same harsh ferocity that
inspired the life of the savage.</p>

<p>To-morrow America goes to war. In great black type
we read the call for men, and a sense of common danger
thrills us. In the evening by a street lamp's glare we
watch a passionate agitator who points to a flag that we
have learned to love. The tramp, tramp of passing regiments
and the sound of martial music thrill us. We lay
down our tool or pen and march to the front. And then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Page 96]</a></span>
comes the first engagement. The air is blackened with
rifle smoke; the roar of cannonry deafens us. Dazed,
we crouch behind an earthwork while the enemy creeps
through the smoke. Suddenly they charge. We fire,
but they surge on through the smoke. They mount the
earthwork. We leap together! Men scream hoarsely!
Musket butts crash! Daggers plunge into quivering
flesh! Divine feeling! Glorious patriotism!</p>

<p>The passing of this savage patriotism is inevitable.
The whole course of nature is against it. The very history
of development will tell you that. Loyalty has
never been an immutable thing. It has been a ceaseless
and irresistible growth from the individual to the family,
to the tribe, to the nation. The time for a world-patriotism
has come. Why should men limit their loyalty by
a row of stones and trees that we call a boundary?
Why are men patriots, anyway, except to save their
privileges and their government? The primitive patriot
had no choice but to fight. He was put down in a little
plot of cleared ground hemmed in by mighty forests,
and made to hew out a home in a vast world of enemies.
But how far we have come from him! The twentieth-century
world is a little world. Our earth is like an open
book. We have cut through the jungle wastes of Africa;
we have photographed the poles. We sell and buy things
from Greenland and Java. In such a civilization war-patriotism
has no place. It is no longer the only guide
to self-preservation; it has become the most terrible instrument
of self-destruction. And for just this reason
war-patriotism must go. It runs counter to the whole
trend of nature itself. It is diametrically opposed to the
mission of patriotism in the world. Just as those little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Page 97]</a></span>
savage families joined hands in tribal loyalty, just as the
scattered clans and tribes united under national government,
so nations must clasp hands around the globe in a
new spirit of "worldism" that shall make war impossible.</p>

<p>But we cannot gain a world-spirit by a sudden destruction
of our patriotism. We will never usher in tranquillity
with a crash. The nihilism of Tolstoy would plunge us
into lawlessness and anarchy, for the chief element of
patriotism we must keep. "What is that element?" you
ask. It is the willingness of the individual to sacrifice
his welfare for the welfare of the group. There we have
the stem of the world-spirit of to-morrow. But the blossom
will not burst forth in a night. It must come by an
unfolding and a growth. We cannot climb to universal
peace upon a golden ladder and cut the rungs beneath
us. Evolution builds on the past. The final spirit of
"worldism" will be a broadening and a deepening and
a humanizing of the spirit of sacrifice which is the
noblest element in our patriotism.</p>

<p>"But," you ask, "if the evolution of patriotism is inevitable,
what have we to do with it? Why should we
meddle with the course of nature?" We reply that the
evolution must come through you. We are not "puppets
jerked by unseen wires." "Consciousness," says Bergson,
"is essentially free." Man the savage or man the philosopher&mdash;he
alone can decide. Let him purify patriotism
with Christianity and he has brotherhood; adulterate it
with avarice and he has war. The evolution of patriotism
is not a physical thing. Listen to Huxley, "Social progress
means a checking of the cosmic process at every
step and the substitution for it of the ethical process."
The evolution of patriotism, then, is a moral thing, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Page 98]</a></span>
morality is man-made. We are men, but we can be supermen.
We are patriots of a nation. We can be patriots
of the world.</p>

<p>The evolution of patriotism is no theorist's dream. It
is a palpable fact. The patriot of one age may be the
scoundrel of the next. A turn of the kaleidoscope and
Paul the convict trades places with Nero the Emperor.
Who was the ideal ancient patriot? The statesman,
Pericles? The thinker, Plato? No. The most efficient
murderer, a Macedonian boy. "I must civilize," he says.
So he starts into his neighbor's country with forty thousand
fighters at his back. Does Persia yield its banner?
No. Then crush it. Does Thebes resist? Then burn
it to the ground. Do the women prate of freedom? Load
them with slave chains. What? Do they still hold out?
Then slaughter the swine. And as men watch him wading
through seas of blood, riding roughshod over prostrate
lives and dead hopes and shattered empires, the
blind age cries out, "O godlike Alexander!"</p>

<p>"Godlike!" Oh, but there's new meaning in that word
to-day. How much nobler a picture our modern patriot
presents! Not waving the brand of destruction, not a
king of murder will you find the great patriot of to-day.
His thunderbolt of conquest was a host of righteousness.
His empire was built in the hearts of men. In the teeming
slums of the world's greatest city he lifted the standard
of the Christ. Haggard children stretched out hands
for bread. He fed them with his last crust. Thousands
were dying in the city's filth. He pointed them to a more
Beautiful City where pain should be no more. And when
the body of William Booth was borne through the silent
throngs of London streets, a million heads were bowed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Page 99]</a></span>
in reverence to this patriot of a purer day. In every
hamlet of civilization some heart called him godlike.</p>

<p>Is not the trend of patriotism clear? Are not the
seeds of a new world-loyalty already in our soil? The
trumpet call to war can never rouse this newer patriotism.
The summons "peace on earth and good will to men"&mdash;that
is the future bugle call. And for us the task is clear.
To take our destiny into our own hands, to throw off the
prejudices of nationalism, to turn our faces resolutely to
the future and strive for that summit of brotherhood and
universal peace, that</p>

<h2>CERTAIN PHASES OF THE PEACE MOVEMENT</h2>


<p>
Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
</p>

<p>We are gathered here this evening in the confident
expectation that a rule of reason will soon be established
among the nations. It has been a hard, at times almost a
discouraging, fight&mdash;for it is difficult to convince the
world of its own insanity, and lovers of peace have
often been tempted to cry in their despair, "How long,
O Lord, how long?"</p>

<p>But there have always been men, with vision unaffected
by martial glamour, who have foreseen in the logic of the
world's history the inevitable end of war, and we have
progressed now to a point where peace is the normal
condition in international relationships. But it is an
armed peace, founded on the false principle of suspicion
and distrust, and we come now to consider the practical
question of what the third Hague Conference can do to
establish peace upon a firm and enduring foundation.</p>

<p>You will remember that the First Hague Conference
established a so-called Permanent Court of Arbitration.
It is not a definite, tangible tribunal, but merely a panel
of a hundred or more men from whom the arbiters in
each specific case may be selected; and therefore, though
it is a great step in the right direction and though it has
accomplished some good work, it has not commanded full
confidence and recognition. To supplement this court
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Page 104]</a></span>
the Conference of 1907 proposed a new organization&mdash;a
Judicial Court of Arbitration, to be composed of seventeen
judges of recognized legal authority, to sit for terms
of twelve years, and to be competent to decide all cases.
Here, then, is the nucleus of an easily accessible supreme
court of the world, whose decisions would soon build
up a new system of international law. Its composition,
jurisdiction, and procedure are agreed upon. The vital
problem, a mode of selecting the judges, remains unsettled.
Evidently, then, the first great duty of the next
Hague Conference is to put into operation this court, of
which all the nations recognize the need and desirability.</p>

<p>Following logically the establishment of competent
machinery for arbitration comes the second great duty
of that conference&mdash;the passage of a convention binding
the nations to resort to this court in all cases that
fail of ordinary diplomatic settlement. The Judicial
Court of Arbitration, if the nations are not bound to use
it, would certainly fail of its purpose. A general treaty
making arbitration obligatory is not too much to demand,
for the Conference of 1907 declared itself unanimous
"in recognizing the principle of compulsory arbitration."
Separate arbitration treaties mounting into the hundreds
have been negotiated between individual nations, but
almost all contain that fatal reservation of questions of
"honor and vital interests." Honor and vital interests&mdash;could
any words be more vague and indefinite? Are
these not the very cases which interested nations are
least competent to decide? A complete answer to that
silly reservation is found in our hundred years' peace
with Great Britain. As John W. Foster, that keen student
of our diplomatic history, has said, "The United
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Page 105]</a></span>
States can have no future dispute with England more
seriously involving the territorial integrity, the honor of
the nation, its vital interests, or its independence, than
those questions which have already been submitted to
arbitration." Denmark has agreed with Italy and the
Netherlands to arbitrate all questions that fail of diplomatic
settlement, thus insuring perpetual peace between
those nations. Here indeed is the pathway of true
national honor.</p>

<p>Coincident with the establishment of the legal machinery
for arbitration and the growth thereof, we would
naturally have expected a cessation in the mad race for
armament-supremacy. But the very reverse has happened,
and to deal firmly with this contradictory situation is the
third great duty of the next Hague Conference. Of what
avail are our Courts of Arbitral Justice when this intolerable
economic waste is permitted! To limit armaments
was the avowed purpose of the First Hague Conference,
but nothing was accomplished save the adoption of a
neatly worded resolution that the limitation aforesaid
is "highly desirable for the enlargement of the material
and moral well-being of humanity." In 1907 the subject
was again under discussion, the nations exhorted to a
serious examination of the question&mdash;and there the matter
rested. We have reached now an insufferable stage
where effective action must be taken. Let us hear no more
that deceptive catch phrase, "If you want peace prepare
for war." When bad blood is likely to arise between
individuals the very worst policy to pursue is to furnish
them with weapons. And so it is with nations. Consider,
if you will, the neck-and-neck race between Great Britain
and the German Empire in the construction of battleships.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Page 106]</a></span>
What fool will call that preparation for war a guaranty
of peace? We might be disposed to admit the sincerity
of those who say we must arm and ever arm to maintain
peace, except that they are too often men with professional
and business interests at stake. In England there
have been amazing revelations of this sinister condition&mdash;armament
companies with peers, members of Parliament,
newspaper owners, officers of the army and navy,
as stockholders; enormous appropriations forced through
Parliament by interested parties; periodic war scares in
newspapers inspired by armament syndicates. Only recently
we read how the great Krupp firm of Germany had
been exposed in its practice of bribing officials to obtain
valuable military information and furnishing French
newspapers with war-scare articles calculated to induce
Germany to increase her armament orders. In Russia
and France they face a similar state of affairs. Here in
the United States we are undoubtedly not free therefrom.
And then there are the navy leagues in every country,
playing upon the fears of the nations by startling tales
of what the others are doing, and so on through an endless
chain, manufacturing a demand for battleships in
the name and under the guise of patriotism. We shrink
from the contemplation of such greed and selfishness,
and appeal for relief to the third Hague Conference.</p>

<p>We come now to a consideration of the fourth prime
duty devolving upon that conference. Ocean commerce
in war should be rendered inviolable. In effecting this
we not only abolish a barbarous custom, but at the
same time remove one of the chief causes of great
navies. As long as the safety of the merchant marine
is not guaranteed by international agreement, just so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Page 107]</a></span>
long will nations with commercial aspirations build enormous
navies for their protection. It is true England has
hitherto opposed this reform,&mdash;confident in her naval
supremacy,&mdash;but she cannot again fly in the face of a
general demand without too great a sacrifice of prestige.</p>

<p>Here, then, are four important problems of the peace
movement, all difficult, but not impossible of solution
when we remember that the Conference of 1907, in good
faith, I believe, adopted the following declaration, "That,
by working together during the past four months, the
collected powers not only have learnt to understand
one another and to draw close together, but have succeeded
... in evolving a very lofty conception of the
common welfare of humanity." Whether these fine
words breathe sincerity or hypocrisy the next Hague
Conference has ample opportunity to prove.</p>

<p>And now, what shall we say of the position of
America in this war against war? Her boundless resources;
her amalgamation of men from all parts of the
world into one people; her impregnable geographical
situation; her embodiment of the three cardinal principles
of world-union (federation, interstate free trade,
interstate courts); the genius and ideals of our government&mdash;all
give America a logical leadership. She can
boast of the first peace society in the world, of a glorious
record of arbitration, of a long list of the wisest
international statesmen, of a most advanced position at
The Hague upon the questions of ocean commerce,
courts of justice, arbitration, limitation of armaments.
But there is the darker view. The treaties negotiated
by Secretary Knox with France and with England, agreeing
to arbitrate every question that fails of diplomatic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Page 108]</a></span>
settlement&mdash;those treaties were rejected by the United
States Senate. There was a transcendent opportunity
to lay the foundation for a speedy realization of peace
universal, with France and England willing, yes, even
anxious to co&ouml;perate&mdash;and America failed! Mr. Taft
has shown that if the position of the Senate is accepted
as international law, then we may as well bid
farewell to any hopes of leadership in the peace movement,
for our nation could then enter upon no general
arbitration agreements because of the prerogative
of the Senate in each specific case to accept or refuse
arbitration.</p>

<p>It is at this point, Ladies and Gentlemen, that there is
work for the humblest of us to do. In the intellectual
field we can aid in the creation of an intelligent, forceful
public opinion that will induce the Senate to recede from
its fatal attitude, and that will resist a false, cheap patriotism
which is relentlessly endeavoring to crush America
'neath the burden of militarism. Then in the moral field
we can stimulate and foster a peaceful attitude, a sentiment
for peace, in the hearts of our countrymen; and
until this is accomplished there can be no peace universal,
for, as Senator Root has said, "The questions at issue
between disputing nations are nothing, the spirit that
deals with them is everything." And finally, in the
educational field, let us take heed that the men and
women of our rising generation are taught the glorious
pages of our arbitration history as well as they know
the battles of our country. Let us take care that it is
grounded into their minds and habits of thought from
earliest years, that "peace hath her victories no less
renowned than war."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Page 109]</a></span>
In conclusion, let us not be deceived by that vain
apology for war, that it is necessary to keep alive the
heroic spirit and to stimulate manly courage. Despite
the noble side in war, its bestial side predominates; its
larger effect upon men is demoralizing. And if it be
glorious to die for a cause, how much nobler to live and
strive for an ideal, utilizing the talents that God gave
us for its realization! The movement for peace is not
one of weaklings and mollycoddles. It is championed
by red-blooded men, daring to bear the ridicule of the
thoughtless and to fight for the preconceptions of humanity.
Peace has her heroes in daily life&mdash;miners,
mariners, policemen, firemen, men of every station, displaying
the nobility of their souls often unheralded and
unsung. The venerable William T. Stead, bearing across
the ocean his message of international good will, sacrificed
his life on the <i>Titanic</i> that others might live. He was
a hero, yes, but a hero of peace.</p>

<p>It would be an insult to your intelligence to prove the
self-evident proposition that war is uneconomic, unscientific,
unchristian. The movement for its elimination,
above all, is logical and practical, and should appeal to
every man. Is it nothing to you? Yes, it is a great
deal to you. Merely let your imaginations picture the
day when the seventy per cent of our national revenue
now sacrificed on the altar of folly is diverted to the arts
of peace, to the amelioration of social conditions, to advancing
the happiness of our people&mdash;at peace with all
other peoples in the assurance of international law and
love. Ladies and Gentlemen, if we but do our duty, the
dawn of that great day will come in our generation!</p>

<h2>THE ASSURANCE OF PEACE</h2>


<p>The birth and rapid rise of the present movement for
international peace are events of recent years. The nineteenth
century found its welcome in the smoking cannon
and crimsoned fields of Hohenlinden. At its close the
first great peace conference of The Hague was in session.
One hundred years ago Napoleon was sweeping across
Europe in his terrible attempt to create an empire. To-day
France, England, and America have agreed on treaties
that declare for unbroken peace. Touched by the wand
of progress, the Utopian ideal of yesterday has become
the dominant political issue of to-day. It is pertinent,
then, that we seek the true nature of this revolution.
Is it borne on the crest of a popular impulse that will
recede as rapidly as it has risen, or is it a permanent
movement, the product of natural forces working through
ordinary channels?</p>

<p>The nineteenth century represents a break with the
past. Swept into the mighty current of transition, the
habits and customs of a thousand years have disappeared.
With the development of natural resources, the establishment
and growth of the factory system, the use of means
of rapid communication, nations have entered upon a new
era. Commerce and industry have come to dominate
thought and action and are transforming the very life
of the world. Defying the rigorous climate of both the
poles, trade has penetrated the frozen recesses of Hudson
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Page 114]</a></span>
Bay and made of the Falkland Islands a relay station in
the progress of victorious industry. Nor is the equatorial
heat more discouraging. The thick jungles of Africa
have yielded their secrets, and the muddy waters of the
Amazon are churned by propellers a thousand miles
from the sea. International trade routes traverse the
seas, connecting continent with continent. In forty
years this commerce has increased from two billions
to thirty billions. Giant corporations have ignored political
boundaries, carried trade wherever profitable,
and are supplying the varied demands of entire communities.
Tariff walls, but lately effective barriers, are
crumbling before the onslaught of trade. Nations are
no longer independent. The wheat from Canada and
the Dakotas feeds the mill workers of Sheffield and the
nobility of Berlin. The failure of the Georgia cotton
crop halts the looms of England and raises the cost of
living throughout Europe. Nations can no longer exist
as self-sufficient economic units. Never before were they
so mutually interdependent. Never before has the welfare
and security of one state depended upon the enterprise
and diligence of another. And the movement for
international peace is the chance offspring of these new
social forces, at once a protest and a warning against
the wrecking of modern economic structures by the
ruthless hand of war.</p>

<p>Commerce, the most important of these new forces,
flourishes unprejudiced by armaments and military prestige.
In the open competition of the world's markets
stronger powers meet and suffer from the rivalry of
states that have no military standing. Relative to population,
Norway has a carrying trade three times as great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Page 115]</a></span>
as England's. With her million trained warriors Germany
is beaten by the merchants of Holland. The flag
of little Denmark flies at more mastheads than does the
Stars and Stripes. Where then is the commercial advantage
supposed to attend superior military strength?</p>

<p>But it is to prevent the seizure of its commerce by others
that nations must empty their treasuries to keep ironclads
afloat. Yet what could be gained by attempted
confiscation? If Germany annihilated England's navy
to-morrow, how would she profit? Commerce is a process
of exchange, the continuance and promotion of
which is dependent upon the degree of mutual profit.
Commercial gain is not a consequent of military success.
It is since England seized the gold fields, diamond mines,
and fertile plateaus of lower Africa that British securities
have dropped twenty points. In 1871 Germany humbled
and humiliated France almost beyond toleration, yet her
share of the world's commerce has not been augmented
thereby. So would it be with England. True, Germany
might commit some depredations and hinder the passage
of trade, but what would be her motive? How could
she gain? Even if the British Isles were depopulated,
it is doubtful whether Germany would benefit. For by
what miracle would Germany be able to develop the
facilities, the shipyards, mills, factories, foundries, mines
and machinery, to supply the trade which the foremost
of commercial nations has been generations in building
up? Germany's banner might wave over the Bank of
England, her excise boats police the Thames and the
Clyde, yet she would behold the trade of a conquered
province going to foreign nations. Trade does not follow
the flag. Undisturbed by political changes or military
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Page 116]</a></span>
reverses, it flows in constantly widening channels wherever
productive fields are found.</p>

<p>And in the waging of war, do we reckon the direct
cost to commerce? The commercial relations of the
entire world are disturbed. Prolonged conflict is accompanied
by the closing of the bank and the factory, the
dismantling of the shop and mill, and the lengthening
of the bread line in every city and town. In what state
of prosperity and happiness might not France have been
had Napoleon never lived? With half a century gone,
our own country is still suffering from the devastation
of the Civil War. Our commerce with South America
is scarcely beyond the point it had reached before our
week-end tiff with Spain. Yet there are those who prate
of national honor and of war as insuring prosperity.
From the leader of a newborn national party we hear
that without a periodic war America would become effeminate
and weak, her aggressive commercial life timid
and corrupt, and within a few brief years the great Republic
would sink to a fourth-rate power. Up, brave
Americans, and man the guns! Awake, sons of freedom,
and sweep the seas! Fourteen years without a war; our
beloved land is ruined. You men of the factory and mill,
you men of property and business, you producers of the
nation's wealth, forward into the carnage; burn the
homes of thrift and industry, for commerce will be enriched
thereby; ravage the fields and despoil the cities,
for this will insure vigorous national life; impoverish
happy peoples, spread famine and pestilence through
fertile valleys, mark the sites of contented villages with
smoldering ruins, defy your Christian God, and kindle
the fires of hell in human breasts; commit violence,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Page 117]</a></span>
treachery, rapine, ay, murder,&mdash;for the eternal glory
of the Stars and Stripes. Yet commerce and industry&mdash;the
glittering prizes which every nation covets when it
builds a dreadnought or enlarges its army&mdash;demand that
the creative forces of peace supplant the destructive
wastes of war.</p>

<p>To-day the financial relationships of nations are inextricably
entangled. The big banks in the capitals of the
world are in communication with each other every second
of the day. During the American crisis in 1907 the bank
rate in England went up to seven per cent, forcing many
British concerns to suspend operations. Because of the
Balkan War the bank rate in Berlin, Paris, and Vienna
is the highest in twenty years, and European securities
have depreciated over six billion dollars. Foreign investments
are raising insuperable barriers to war. Should
the French bombard Hamburg to-day they would destroy
the property of Frenchmen. Let Emperor William capture
London, loot the Bank of England, and he will
return to find German industry paralyzed, the banks
closed, and a panic sweeping the land. Let English
regiments again move to invade the United States,
English warships draw up in battle line to attack our
seaports, and four billions of the earnings of the English
people would bar the way. To the victor of the
present the spoils of war are valueless. Japan, victor
over the great Russian Empire, staggers under a colossal
debt. The Italian government hears rumbles of
discontent, because the cost of winning a victory has
been too great. What better proof do we need that
war is profitless, that it means financial suicide? It
has been transformed from a gainful occupation into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Page 118]</a></span>
economic folly, and war will cease because the price
is becoming prohibitive.</p>

<p>In this movement for peace, capital's strongest ally
is her most active enemy. Raised to a position of independence
and power by the Industrial Revolution, labor
is wielding an effective influence. The complexity of
modern business has aroused workingmen in every
country to a common interest and sympathy. The
International Congress of Trade Unions, representing
twenty countries and over ten million men, has declared
for universal disarmament. Just last month eighty-five
thousand coal miners in Illinois resolved that if the
United States declared war on a foreign power, they
would call a general strike.</p>

<p>And why not? Why should the workingmen of one
country offer themselves as targets for those of another?
Why should the workers of Germany be taxed to support
a war against England, Germany's best market?
Can the rice growers of Japan profit by killing Americans
to whom they sell their produce? War means
suffering and want, and the laborer has come to know
it. He is cold to the sight of its flaunting flags and the
sound of its grand, wild music, for he sees the larder
bare, funds exhausted, and hunger at the door. He refuses
to sacrifice his body and the welfare of his family
upon the altar of Mars. No longer can kings and emperors
satisfy their grasping ambitions. Armed by the
ballot, the masses are to-day supreme. Never again will
the cruel hand of tyranny press to their lips the poisoned
cup of death. Their sway is absolute. The destinies of
nations are in their keeping. The decree has gone forth
that war must cease.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Page 119]</a></span>
Born of these greater movements, a host of influences
bring nearer the dawn of peace. The express and the
wireless have supplanted the oxcart and the courier.
Chicago and Boston are closer to-day than New York
and Albany a century ago. Within the hour of their
occurrence events that happen in Paris are published in
Chicago and St. Louis. Political boundaries are fading
before larger interests. Every railroad train crossing the
frontier, every ship plying the seas, every article of
commerce, every exchange of business, every cable conveying
news from distant lands&mdash;all these are potent
factors in the cause of international peace. Add to
these the conciliating influence of foreign investments,
the telephone and telegraph, travel, education, democracy,
religion, and you have marshaled a host for peace
whose clarion trumpets shall never sound retreat. Casting
aside the prejudice of ages, modern industrialism
flings around the world the economic bonds against
which the forces of militarism are powerless.</p>

<p>Here, then, in the world-wide operations of commerce
and industry is the <i>assurance of peace</i>. The skeptic may
scoff and the cynic point to Mexico and the Balkans,
but the Industrial Revolution has produced a multitude
of influences that are knitting the nations into an indissoluble
unity. Men are beginning to realize the integrity
of mankind, and a world-consciousness is arising. Kindness
and justice&mdash;yesterday but community ideals&mdash;are
extending their sway throughout the earth. Even while
bayonets are bared in conflict and cannon thunder against
hostile camps, the magic of our civilization is weaving
bonds of union that cannot be broken. Peace, not war,
is the true grandeur of nations; love, not hate, is the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Page 120]</a></span>
immutable law of God; and so surely as governments
and kings are powerless to divide when home and factory
would bind, some not too distant day will find the
battle flags all furled, the sword's arbitrament abandoned,
and the world at peace.</p>

<h2>EDUCATION FOR PEACE</h2>


<p>Time was when war was beneficial. Historians have
justified the spread of knowledge by the sword. At the
world's awakening, it was well that the new thought
should be diffused even at the sacrifice of human blood.
It was justified because there was no other means. We
have to cast our imagination back through the centuries
and realize that then there were no railroads, no telegraph,
no newspapers; that man was bound by narrow
limits; and the elemental processes of the world were
undiscovered. We do not criticize Alexander for conquering
the eastern perils, for he carried in his phalanxes
the spirit of new-discovered thought. We do not denounce
Rome for piercing the unknown realms with her
legions, for she was the mother of a new belief. But
this was at the dawn of history, when erudition was in
its struggling embryo, and the physical was the better
part of man. Man went forth to battle as a religion.</p>

<p>The world grew partly wise, and man preached the
gospel of brotherhood. But it did not last. The changing
of the peoples smoldered the fires of rising intelligence,
and the world rolled back again in darkness&mdash;a
darkness long and black. Centuries passed, and a new
light came, slowly but courageously. Man blinkingly
came forth, dazed and unsteady. The light grew, and
man grew with it; but rooted deep in his heart was the
love of war of his ancestors. In a different spirit, it is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Page 124]</a></span>
true; but it was there, and he went forth to battle not
because it was religion, but because it was brave.</p>

<p>The world rolled on; war grew; it developed with
the state; it became an art; was studied&mdash;and now our
cycle turns. It faces us as a custom backed up by the
centuries&mdash;deep-rooted, a consumer that yields no returns
and, what with our modern appliances, a terror
to the hearts of all the world. Men fought in the early
ages because they thought it was just; men fought in
the Middle Ages because they considered it brave; men
of our modern age will banish war because it is a
fallacy.</p>

<p>Do you know that to maintain our so-called prestige we
spend seventy per cent of our national income? Think
of it! Seventy per cent to maintain our present status
and to prepare for the future! Think of that awful
drain; think, if applied in other channels, what good
could be done! We are proud of our battleship <i>Texas</i>.
She is a noble war dog; yet do you realize that if we
had applied the money spent on her in our own state
we could have had one gigantic paved highway twice
the distance from El Paso to Galveston? We could have
had two hundred high schools, representing $75,000 each.
We could have raised our institutions of higher learning
to a level with any of the East or North. Fifteen millions
gone for a floating war machine which in twenty
years will be a piece of rusted, useless iron; fifteen millions
for a sailing dragon who, each time one of her big
guns speaks, wastes the equivalent of a four-year college
education for some youth&mdash;$1700&mdash;for a single shot.
Our war dogs sail the seas; our soldiers parade our
forts; and we look on and raise a joyous hubbub as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Page 125]</a></span>
nations of the world rush madly on, wasting themselves
in the race for military supremacy.</p>

<p>Have you ever considered yourself transported to some
celestial height, and there, from the regions of the infinite,
allowed to view a battle on earth? How foolish it must
seem, these pygmies coming forth to make war. See them
as they charge and wound and kill! See brother slay
brother! See the wounded left to die! Hear the cries
of distress, and picture the grief that follows all! Men
battling to conquer; men assuming the prerogative of
a god&mdash;how foolish, yet how serious! And these artificial
lines that men call boundaries, how punctiliously
they are guarded! "Take but a hundred feet, and we
shall war with thee." How foolish this too must seem
when viewed from above&mdash;that we should carry on war
over even a slight infraction on any imaginary, mathematical
line.</p>

<p>We cherish the thought that the youth of our land
are being taught self-restraint. It is ever impressed upon
them that there are courts of justice for the settlement
of controversies. Law and order have become stock
phrases, dinned into their ears at every turn. The man
who would settle his difficulty by trying the physical
metal of his adversary is of the past. By the new order
he is taboo as a savage. Individual self-restraint rings
out in our vocabulary as nationally descriptive. The
babe at the mother's knee learns first the virtue of it;
the child at school is tutored to it soundly; the man in
life is lectured with it regularly. Brotherhood! Love!
Self-restraint!</p>

<p>But what of the self-restraint of the nation? In the
teaching of the individual, is it not odd and inconsistent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Page 126]</a></span>
that we forget the teaching of the unit? We paint the
inner rooms of our national character with colors bright
and pleasing, but the exterior, though weathering the
heavier storms, is forgotten. If the child be taught that
individuals should arbitrate their differences, can he not
learn that the individual nations are subject to the same
rule? If arbitration is best for each man, surely it must
be best for all. If the child be taught that self-restraint
is the boasted characteristic of the model American,
should he not learn that the model American nation
should be self-restraining? Let us learn this lesson, and
surely we will never war. Herein shall we find the solution
of this great problem. We can preach about peace
and write pretty orations, but if we are to impress it
upon the hearts of the world, we must teach it, and in
a systematic manner. It is not to be learned in a day.
It is the labor of a generation and more. It must be
a fully developed characteristic. Man is learning self-development;
now we must turn to the bigger ideals&mdash;national
restraint, national development, international
brotherhood.</p>

<p>Do you say this is idealism&mdash;visionary? On the
contrary, it is thoroughly practicable. The only way to
attain world-peace is for the individual citizen to think
peace, to teach peace, and to act in accordance with such
thoughts and teachings. Just as public opinion causes
war, so only through cultivated public opinion can we
hope for peace. I do not say to sink our battleships and
turn free our army. I do not argue that we should quit
guarding ourselves and throw ourselves open to the
world; but what I seek is that we should turn our faces
with bright hope to the future, eager to assist in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Page 127]</a></span>
abolition of all that tends to war, eager to assist in the only
proper way&mdash;the enlightenment of the world-nations.</p>

<p>The call comes naturally to America, the land of new
belief; America, the New World of Opportunity, as
Emerson calls it; the land cut off from the conventional
past; a land that has taken world-leadership in the march
of a single century. To America, where problems are
studied and fallacies dethroned, the birthplace and the
abiding home of democracy; to America, the Christian,
the civilized! What will the answer be? Already we
can hear the faint responses, as yet vague and indistinct,
the drowned murmurings of the wiser tongues. These
must grow into a national anthem whose echo will challenge
the powers of the world and startle them into the
consciousness of the new brotherhood. We will answer:</p>

<p>"Yes, we have learned the lessons of the centuries&mdash;that
war is a fallacy, and armed peace its ill-sprung child;
that man is no longer savage; that with enlightened mind
he has controlled his warring instinct; that human love
is a mightier power than war; and that we are one in
the brotherhood of the Master.</p>

<p>"Let us stand before the nations, clad in simple honesty,
panoplied in elemental justice; let us appeal to the
common conscience of the world; let us say to the war-made
powers, there is a way out, and we will lead. We
will help you police the sea; we will give our constabulary
to a quota of peace, but we are through. No great
standing army, no more leviathan battleships. We trust
to what we boast of as the highest attainment of the age,
the innate justice of civilized humanity."</p>

<p>To such a national summons, how will Texas respond?
Facing the Mexican boundary for eight hundred miles,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Page 128]</a></span>
Texas is to-day peculiarly the guardian of our nation.
The situation calls not for agitation and jingoism, bit for
rare patience, sanity, and self-control. Through troubled
waters our chosen captain is guiding the Ship of State.
It is no time for mutiny, but rather a time for obedience.</p>

<p>In this critical hour let every loyal citizen say with
a contemporary poet:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In this grave hour&mdash;God help keep the President!</span><br />
To him all Lincoln's tenderness be lent,<br />
The grave, sweet nature of the man that saw<br />

His high-poised duty from its primal plan<br />
Of rule supreme for the whole good of man.<br /><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In this grave hour&mdash;Lord, give him all the light,</span><br />
And us the faith that peace is more than might,<br />
That settled nations have high uses still<br />
To curb the hasty, regulate the ill,<br />
And without bloodshed from the darkest hour<br />

<h2>NATIONAL HONOR AND PEACE</h2>


<p>Since the dawn of history the teachers, thinkers, and
prophets of mankind have prayed and labored for the
abolition of war. In the process of the centuries, their
hope has become the aspiration of the mass of men.
Growing slowly, as do all movements for righteousness,
the cause of peace first claimed the attention of the
world in the year 1899, when Nicholas of Russia called
the nations together to discuss ways and means for the
arbitration of international differences and for the abolition
of war. From that day on, the movement for peace
has progressed by leaps and bounds, and to-day it has
reached the highest point of its development.</p>

<p>Already nations have signed treaties to arbitrate many
of their differences. Holland, Denmark, Argentina, and
Chile have agreed to arbitrate every dispute. But these
nations are not potent enough in world affairs for their
action to have an international influence. It remains for
the great powers like England, France, Germany, and
the United States to agree to submit every difficulty to
arbitration, and thus take the step that will result in
the practical abolition of war.</p>

<p>If one would find the reasons that thus far have kept
the great powers from agreeing to submit <i>all</i> differences
to arbitration, his search need not be long nor difficult.
The Peace Conference of 1907 reports that the objections
to international arbitration have dwindled to four.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Page 132]</a></span>
Of these objections the one commonly considered of most
weight is this: "We will not submit to arbitration questions
involving our national honor." Even so recently
as the spring of 1912, our own Senate refused to give
its assent to President Taft's proposed treaties with
France and England to arbitrate all differences, and refused
on the ground that "we cannot agree to arbitrate
questions involving our national honor." This is the
statement that you and I as workers for peace are
constantly called upon to refute.</p>

<p>Let us, therefore, consider what honor is. For centuries
honor was maintained and justice determined among
men by a strong arm and a skillfully used weapon. It
mattered not that often the guilty won and the dishonorable
succeeded. Death was the arbiter, honor was appeased,
and men were satisfied. But with the growth of
civilization there slowly came to man the consciousness
that honor can be maintained only by use of reason and
justice administered only in the light of truth. Then
private settlement of quarrels practically ceased; trial
by combat was abolished; and men learned that real
honor lies in the graceful and manly acceptance of decisions
rendered by impartial judges.</p>

<p>As men have risen to higher ideals of honor in their
relations with one another, so nations have risen to a
higher standard in international affairs. Centuries ago
tyrants ruled and waged war on any pretext; now before
rulers rush to arms, they stop to count the cost.
Nations once thought it honorable to use poisoned bullets
and similar means of destruction; a growing humanitarianism
has compelled them to abandon such practices.
At one time captives were killed outright; there was a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Page 133]</a></span>
higher conception of honor when they were forced into
slavery; now the quickening sense of universal sympathy
compels belligerent nations to treat prisoners of
war humanely and to exchange them at the close of the
conflict. At one time neutrals were not protected; now
their rights are generally recognized. A few hundred
years ago arbitration was almost unknown; in the last
century more than six hundred cases were settled by
peaceful means.</p>

<p>During the last quarter of a century we have caught
a glimpse of a new national honor. It is the belief that
battle and bloodshed, except for the immediate defense
of hearth and home, is a blot on the 'scutcheon of any
nation. It is the creed of modern men who rise in their
majesty and say: "We will not stain our country's honor
with the bloodshed of war. God-given life is too dear.
The forces of vice, evil, and disease are challenging us
to marshal our strength and give them battle. There is
too much good waiting to be done, too much suffering
waiting to be appeased, for us to waste the life-blood of
our fathers and sons on the field of useless battle. Here
do we stand. We believe we are right. With faith in
our belief we throw ourselves upon the altar of truth.
Let heaven-born justice decide." Here is honor unsmirched,
untainted! Here is pride unhumbled! Here
is patriotism that is all-embracing, that makes us so
zealous for real honor that we turn from the horrors
of war to combat the evils that lie at our very doors.</p>

<p>We know that faith in such national honor will abolish
war. We know, too, that men will have war only so long
as they want war. If this be true, then, just as soon as
you and I, in whose hands the final decision for or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Page 134]</a></span>
against war must ever rest, express through the force
of an irresistible public opinion the doctrine that our
conception of national honor demands the arbitration of
every dispute, just so soon will our legislators free themselves
from financial dictators and liberate the country
from the dominance of a false conception of national
honor.</p>

<p>Do you say this ideal is impractical? History proves
that questions of the utmost importance can be peacefully
settled without the loss of honor. The Casa Blanca
dispute between France and Germany, the Venezuela
question, the North Atlantic Fisheries case, the Alabama
claims&mdash;these are proof indisputable that questions of
honor may be successfully arbitrated. "Does not this
magnificent achievement," says Carl Schurz of the Alabama
settlement, "form one of the most glorious pages
of the common history of England and America? Truly,
the two great nations that accomplished this need not be
afraid of unadjustable questions of honor in the future."</p>

<p>In the face of such splendid examples, how meaningless
is the doctrine of the enemies of peace, "We will
not arbitrate questions of national honor. We will decide
for ourselves what is right and for that right we will
stand, even if this course plunges us into the maelstrom
of war. We will not allow our country to be dishonored
by any other." Well has Andrew Carnegie expressed the
modern view: "Our country cannot be dishonored by
any other country, or by all the powers combined. It
is impossible. All honor wounds are self-inflicted. We
alone can dishonor ourselves or our country. One sure
way of doing so is to insist upon the unlawful and unjust
demand that we sit as judges in our own case,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Page 135]</a></span>
instead of agreeing to abide by the decision of a court or
a tribunal. We are told that this is the stand of a weakling,
that progress demands the fighting spirit. We, too,
demand the fighting spirit; but we condemn the military
spirit. We are told that strong men fight for honor. We
answer with Mrs. Mead: 'Justice and honor are larger
words than peace, and if fighting would enable us to get
justice and maintain honor, I would fight! But it is not
that way!'" For it is impossible to maintain honor by
recourse to arms; right may fall before might, and,
viewed in the light of its awful cost, even victory is
defeat. In the words of Nicholas Murray Butler: "To
argue that a nation's honor must be defended by the
blood of its citizens, if need be, is quite meaningless, for
any nation, though profoundly right in its contention,
might be defeated at the hands of a superior force exerted
in behalf of an unjust and unrighteous cause.
What becomes of national honor then?"</p>

<p>Too long have we been fighting windmills; we must
struggle with ourselves; we must conquer the passions
that have blinded our reason. We have been enrolled in
the army of thoughtlessness; the time has come to enroll
in the army of God. We have followed a false ideal of
honor; we must disillusion ourselves and the world. If
men declare that the preservation of courage and manliness
demand that we fight, let us lead them to the fight,
not against each other, but against all that is unrighteous
and undesirable in our national life. Men still cling
to an ancient conception of national honor; let us convince
them that there is a newer and higher conception.
Men still declare that peace is the dream of the poet
and prophet; let us prove by historical example that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Page 136]</a></span>
questions, even of national honor, can be happily settled
by arbitration. If men despair, let us remind them that
to-day, as never before, the mass of men are slowly and
surely working out God's plan for this great cause.</p>

<p>The day of triumph is not far distant. Already the
moving finger of Time paints on the wide horizon, in
the roseate tints of the dawn, the picture of Peace&mdash;Peace,
the victory of victories, beside which Marathon
and Gettysburg pale into insignificance; victory without
the strains of martial music, unaccompanied by the sob
of widowed and orphaned; victory on God's battlefield
in humanity's war on war.</p>

<h2>THE NEW NATIONALISM AND THE PEACE MOVEMENT</h2>


<p>Nationalism is a precious product of the centuries.
The world has paid a tremendous price to widen the
political unit until its boundaries include continents.
It has been an equally difficult task to weld the spirit
of diverse peoples into a homogeneous whole. And the
story of this development constitutes a heritage not soon
to be given up. The tales of victory and defeat are held
even more dear to a united people than life itself. Rightly
will any nation jealously defy him who dares advance
to plunder its possessions. And it is well that men do
not wish to surrender it upon slight provocation. That
has been a good diplomacy that sought to protect the
nation by war. By the extension of political unity
peoples gain moral and physical strength. Thrift becomes
more common and moral courage greater when a
people strike forward with common aims. And in proportion
as the nation as a whole enjoys these advantages
and opportunities, the individual widens his horizon in
peaceful association with fellow men and receives a
benefit beyond computation.</p>

<p>But, good as nationalism has been in the past, a gradual
change seems to be overtaking the world's politics.
National diplomacy hesitates where a century ago it
was firm. Forces which once drove the nations apart
seem now to be drawing them together. The discord of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Page 140]</a></span>
disputes seems to be disappearing in the harmony of
co&ouml;peration. It is no longer possible to determine easily
what a nation's interests really are. And it is of the
forces that are bringing about this change in the policies
of nations, of this new nationalism and its bearing upon
the peace movement, that I wish to speak.</p>

<p>Within the last two centuries economic forces have
worked a mighty revolution. Continents have been converted
into communities. The prosperity of our eastern
industries controls the activities of the West, and a disturbance
from any section throws a tremor over all.
Tribal barter has developed into a world-wide commerce
until the most distant nation may easily acquire the
products of another. Steel rails weave a web of commercialism
among the peoples, and the cable welds them
in a mighty network which, responsive to every flash of
news, brings all the nations into a mutuality of interests.
So interdependent are the nations and so vital are their
relations that a single fluctuation in the most distant
market finds a response in our own. A slight disorder
in Wall Street strains the whole financial world. And
thus through intercourse in commerce, industry, the
press, Christian missions, and scholastic research a system
has been developed that holds no place for the selfish
policy of exploiting backward peoples. We no longer
consider the advance of alien peoples in wealth and
prosperity as a menace to our own. There is being developed
a strong international public opinion which realizes
that anything that destroys the well-being of one
member is the concern of all.</p>

<p>In the light of these facts, future world-politics <ins class="correction" title="original has repeated words 'can can'">can</ins>
have no place for the settlement of disputes by force.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Page 141]</a></span>
A declaration of war by one of the large powers to-day
would be more terrible than it has ever been in the past.
The man of business, of education, of philanthropy, of
civic advancement cannot reasonably advocate a policy
that would ruin business, stagnate education, increase
poverty, and turn progress over to the ravages of manslaughter.
Industry cannot continue when the shoulder
that should turn the wheels of industry grows weary
beneath the weight of the musket. Education cannot
proceed when libraries and lecture halls are deserted for
the camp and fortress. A Tolstoy with all his power of
vivid presentation does not overdraw the picture. The
moral fiber and physical strength of a people must forever
afterward bear their scars. A struggling people can
never rid themselves of the evil effects of the conflict,
although they may rejoice in the valor of their heroes.
Nations cannot afford to become the theaters of carnage
and bloodshed and the rendezvous of commercial and
moral pirates and civic grafters.</p>

<p>Why, then, do nations throw away their strength in
the building and equipping of armies and navies? The
advocates of militarism tell us that we need a navy to
protect our commerce. Possibly it is true that under the
present system of international law this is somewhat
excusable; for although private property on land is
exempt from confiscation and the old forms of privateering
have long ago been abolished by an agreement of
the powers, yet the policy does not apply to maritime
warfare. Enemy's goods in enemy's ships are still subject
to seizure. But while this argument does hold for
the present, the condition could easily be remedied.
Because a man with foreign capital operates ships instead
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Page 142]</a></span>
of factories, why is there any special reason for exposing
his property to depredation? In the light of common
sense such a policy seems absurd. And it should be one
of the first aims of our diplomats to eliminate all possibility
of this licensed robbery, for as long as it exists
there will always be the cry for extravagant expenditure
in order to preserve international peace.</p>

<p>But even if we should not need a navy to protect our
commerce, again the opponents of the policy of settling
international disputes by arbitration say that we need
armies and navies to preserve our honor. They tell us
that there are certain questions which cannot be submitted
to any tribunal; that a nation must reserve the
right to submit only those questions it sees fit. Surrender
this right, and prestige and self-respect are gone and we
become a nation of "mollycoddles" whose patriotism has
no virile qualities. It is true that the independence and
security of each nation is essential to international life.
It is self-governing nations, not subjugated ones, that
make possible a strong international life. But the converse
is equally true. An international life made up of
independent, co&ouml;perating, and mutually helpful nations
is the best security by which national life can be guaranteed.
Those who say that questions of national honor
cannot be submitted to a tribunal have a wrong conception
of the essence of national life. Love of country
means more than a mere willingness to serve as a target
for the enemy's guns. We would not deduct one iota
from the respect and honor due those who have served
the nation on the field of battle. But what a service
they might have rendered if they had been spared that
life to live serving their fellow men and contributing to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Page 143]</a></span>
the vigor of the race! None of us will give up his firm
resolve to defend his own country with all his strength.
But theirs is a cheap patriotism which depends for its
expression upon the thrilling note of fife and drum. The
great test of patriotism is the everyday purpose to deal
justly with one's neighbor. Let him who would be a
patriot and serve the nation put his life into the work
close at hand, and, with a civic temper and moral courage
that can grip the scourge, rid our social life of its damning
influences. This is the spirit of true national honor.
This it is that makes of a nation a real nation. The call
to arms is but another signal of the defeat of the underlying
principles of civilization.</p>

<p>Only slowly will any large number of the people accept
these new conceptions. But there are already hopeful
signs. The growing sentiment is rapidly crystallizing.
The developing code of international equity as expressed
by the establishment of such an institution as the Hague
Court is a step in the right direction. The peaceful settlement
of the Venezuelan boundary dispute was an
honor to the nations involved. And the work of the
International Commission of Inquiry in the Dogger Bank
episode between Russia and England is significant of the
trend. Again, a modern innovation was wrought when
the International Conference in 1906 settled the conflicting
interests of Germany, France, and Spain in
Morocco. Within the last century the powers ratified
over two hundred treaties, each providing for the peaceful
settlement by tribunals of specified international disputes.
It is true that most peace treaties have dealt
almost exclusively with legal questions. The nations
have hesitated to submit all international differences to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Page 144]</a></span>
a court of arbitration. But the spirit for arbitral settlement
is widening. And this spirit is not for a mere
avoidance of war, but seeks the substitution of a better
method than war for determining justice between nations.
Each nation has its own individual problems to deal with,
and in this respect all cannot proceed according to set
rules. The movement does not mean the extinction and
obliteration of nationality and national rights. The individual
has not been minimized because he consents to
submit his differences with his fellow men to a court for
settlement. And this must be the ultimate attitude of
nations whose honor we have a right to guard jealously.</p>

<p>What, then, shall be our program? Whatever attitude
is to be adopted, most people agree that the day of universal
peace is far in the future. The Balkans and
Mexico remind us of the difficulty lying before the
coming generations. But the numerous peace societies
whose purpose it is to circulate authentic documents,
that the great mass of citizens may be brought into sympathetic
touch through accurate information, are doing
much for the cause. The erection of the Hague Court
gives something lasting and tangible to work from.
And, above all, the nations will rise to higher standards
principally by adopting the ideals of the individual. As
man has risen above his barbaric ideals, so will the nations
throw their military expenditures into the coffers of public
welfare as they come more and more to judge their successes,
not by victories in war but by achievements in
education, commerce, industry, and artizanship. And,
proceeding with such aims, the established international
court must be the medium through which all differences
will be settled. We shall discover that our internal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Page 145]</a></span>
policy of dealing with the individual can be more easily
applied to international relations than was at first supposed.
And having reached this point in the evolution
of international peace, there must be added to the international
court a world-wide police force. As the system
develops and our prejudices are abandoned, a method of
policing must stand as an enforcer of international law.
Until then there is little hope that military expenditures
will radically diminish, for we cannot reasonably abolish
our present methods unless we have something secure
to substitute.</p>

<p>Perhaps such a system will not abolish the utter possibility
of war. Only the future can tell us what heights
of success the policy will reach. There are those of us
who have high hopes because we believe in the good
sense of the American people and of our great contemporaries.
By the past we are made confident of the
future. But if the goal is to be reached, it is for us as
individual citizens to contribute our influence toward
developing the attitude of peace among our fellow men.
For our international welfare and for the honor of the
newest of great nations, may we in this issue throw our
influence, as a united people, on the side of a higher
international morality! May the united peoples of the
world abolish the prejudices of misconceptions and,
drawn together by common interests, resolve that the
priceless heritage of centuries shall not be imperiled by
war! And thus over a warring humanity the breaking
day of peace shall be hastened, at whose high noon there
shall be heard not the clashing of arms but the increasing
hum of prosperity under the sway of the new and
better national life.</p>

<h2>MAN'S MORAL NATURE THE HOPE OF UNIVERSAL PEACE</h2>


<p>Two thousand years ago the coming of a Prince of
Peace, the Prince of Peace, inaugurated the fulfillment
of the prophetic promise that "peace shall cover the
earth," and that "man shall learn war no more forever."
From the time of Jesus until now men have passively
accepted the idea, but have failed to do their part in its
fulfillment. To-day there are few indeed but believe that
it would be desirable to abolish war. Many also feel in
a way that war is brutal. But here our feelings on this
great question largely end. We are not aroused to talk,
and work, and fight against war as inhuman, as economic
folly, as unreason, and especially as an immorality and
a sin. Now we are not here to harangue about the physical
sufferings wrought through war, but we are here to
inquire and find out what we can do about it. How are
we going to attack the war problem in order to bring
about action, instead of simply talk and discussion? In
considering this war problem it is well to bear in mind
the fact that war is a resultant of a deeper cause, the war
spirit. The war spirit is the spirit of him who first made
war in heaven; the war spirit&mdash;ambitious, aggressive,
covetous and revengeful, rampant through the centuries,
never conquered by force, in war subdued only by
exhaustion. This war spirit still exists to scourge the
nations with war, to stagger with its problem of war the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Page 150]</a></span>
brains of statesmen believing in peace. How are we to
attack this stupendous problem? What appeal can we
make to the nations that will be strong enough to do
away with the war spirit?</p>

<p>In order to overthrow this mighty evil, certainly every
possible force must be enlisted. The thought which I
wish to bring to you is this: While such appeals as those
to economy and to reason are of value, they are not in
themselves strong enough to cause the nations to abolish
war; and hence, in view of the real inner nature of the
war spirit, man's moral nature, working through a developed
conscience upon war, is the only force strong enough
to effect universal peace.</p>

<p>Against war peace-advocates appeal with force from a
business standpoint, on grounds of economy and financial
expediency. The vast system of international trade
and commerce calls for world peace. The prosperity of
world-industries and business requires good will and
brotherhood between the nations. So heavy, also, have
the burdens of war and militarism become that three
fourths of our own expenditures go for war purposes,
past and present, and in Great Britain two thirds are so
spent.<a name="FNanchor_1_10" id="FNanchor_1_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_10" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Every German citizen, it is said, carries a soldier
on his back. By the testimony of financiers and ministers
of state themselves, nothing but financial ruin and
bankruptcy await the nations if the present military
tragedy continues. But has this obvious condition of
affairs affected the race for armaments? Not unless it
has accelerated it. To every appeal to economy the
reply is that the outlay is necessary if we are to exist at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Page 151]</a></span>
all. But even suppose that for a season the economic
motive should lead us to abolish war, as soon as financial
advantage was apparent to a nation through war it is
evident that all restraints would be removed and war
ensue again. The same motive used to abolish war would
bring war once more. Again, when we remember that it
is the deeper cause, the war spirit, that we must quench,
we can understand why this appeal is often made to
those who bear not. So far as the great mass of men is
concerned, purely economic considerations cannot change
the spirit and impulses of the soul. History reveals no
great uplifting of humanity or change in ideals as having
arisen through purely economic or financial considerations.</p>

The percentages as a matter of fact are not so large, but the argument
is not impaired by the fact.&mdash;<i>Editor.</i></p></div>

<p>The peace plea has also been based on grounds of
reason. Clearly has it been pointed out that reason
demands that no person shall sit in judgment on his own
case, yet this we do in a resort to arms. War is not
arbitrament by reason, but arbitrament by the sword.
Every plain argument of reason condemns war and
militarism. The arguments of reason have, indeed, been
strong, and have attracted much attention, resulting in
the settlement of many disputes by arbitration. But as
concerns the final wiping out of war and the surrendering
of heavy armaments, reason alone cannot present a
permanent powerful appeal, for it is easy in times of
stress to plead that reason and justice demand the war.
Never was there a fight but the contending parties
claimed they were justified. But the chief fact that
seems to put reason in the category of impotent appeals
is the fact that it is an appeal to the mind, while the war
spirit can only be removed by an appeal to the heart,
wherein it resides. We may reason with nations all we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Page 152]</a></span>
please, but when the war fury arises, then all the reasoning
proves to have been in vain, the appeal to the mind
turns out to be too feeble.</p>

<p>Appeals to economy and reason, then, are appeals
we must make, but they are too weak in themselves
to make a permanent impression against the war spirit.
We must then look for some additional, some more
compelling, force.</p>

<p>Let us examine the real inner nature of war, for this
ought surely to throw some light upon our problem.
War is not economy; it is not reason. Is war, then,
morality? Is it virtue? It would hardly seem necessary
for us to answer this question, for modern civilized
nations long ago recognized blood feuds with their kindred
as contrary to real morality, as nothing but murder;
but they seem unable to recognize that war is just the
same&mdash;nothing but legalized, organized murder. From
the use of violence in settling our international disputes
arise all the deadly passions of the soul, such as treachery,
insolence, revenge, and a murderous spirit, with
the accompanying fruits of robbery, misery, and blood.
Surely, O nations! nothing which bears such fruits can
be anything but corrupt, for a good tree cannot bring
forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth
good fruit.</p>

<p>Look also at its relationship to civilization and citizenship,
and its effects upon theme. "War and civilization,"
said one of the great English ministers, "are contradictory
terms, even as Christ and Mars." Particularly
damaging is the effect of war upon citizens. For does it
not blunt the sensibilities, harden the heart, inflame the
mind with passions, and deaden the consciences of men?
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Page 153]</a></span>
Said the same great English preacher, "The sword that
smites the enemy abroad, also lays bare the primeval
savage within the citizen at home." And again, "War is
not so horrible in that it drains the dearest veins of the
foe, but in that it drains our own hearts of the yet more
precious elements of pity, mercy, generosity, which are
the lifeblood of the soul."</p>

<p>What now must be our conclusion about war? Had
we ten thousand voices, surely every one would be in
honor bound to declare war an immorality. Every incident
of war declares it such. Every result of battle hands
down the same decree. In the words of a famous
Russian battle painter, we too may define war as "the
antithesis of all morality."</p>

<p>This clear idea of the real inner nature of war ought
surely to enable us to find our ground of attack. Since
war is sin and war is crime, the conclusion which we
draw is, that if it is possible ever to abolish war, man's
conscience, his sense of right and wrong, is the only force
powerful enough to accomplish the result.</p>

<p>The great searchlight of morality must be turned on
war&mdash;a searchlight which is always bright and strong
and which never has failed to reveal the truth. To turn
this on full and strong means to awaken the consciences
of men. It must be an individual proposition&mdash;not simply
the developed consciences of a few leaders who may be
submerged by the war spirit of the masses, but there
must be developed consciences of all the people individually.
All our arbitration treaties and the actual settlement
of disputes by arbitration are of great value and
should be pressed as far as possible; but are these sufficient
forces to develop the consciences of men against
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Page 154]</a></span>
war as an immorality and a sin? What are the forces
that have always come to our support against an immorality
and a sin?</p>

<p>How about our churches? Have they been doing
their duty? Have they made it clear that war is sin and
war is crime? Has not the Church been too easy? Has
its voice sounded clear and strong on this world-evil?
Surely a duty rests upon the ministry to be insistent in
its characterization of war. What peace-advocates must
do is to urge this upon the Church and bring it to a realization
of its duty. Church members know the character
of war and simply need to have the matter brought home
to their hearts.</p>

<p>What about our schools,&mdash;not simply the colleges and
universities, but all the schools,&mdash;which offer fertile
ground to sow the seeds of peace? Thus far in the history
of our schools too much emphasis has been laid upon military
history, etc. Dates and events of national wars have
been thoroughly drilled into students, and the glory and
blaze of war brought out. We have actually made it a
glory and a virtue. One of the most encouraging signs
of the times, however, is the fact that many of our text-books
are dropping out the prolonged study of wars and
centering more on the peaceful pursuits of the nation
and the commercial relations with foreign powers. How
about direct peace teaching in the lower schools? How
much of it do we include in the work? None at all.
Many are the speakers who address the schools on war
reminiscences, but few indeed are the appeals made for
peace. Not until this movement is strongly emphasized
in our schools from the very beginning can we hope
completely to drive out the war spirit; for time is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Page 155]</a></span>
required to develop in the individual conscience a full
realization of the real nature of war, and such development
should begin with the plastic period of youth.</p>

<p>With Church and school lined up on the side of peace,
the home teaching will soon fall in line; and Church,
school, and home combined can develop so strong a conviction
concerning war, can make so forceful an appeal
to man's moral nature, that the war spirit will take its
leave and be gone forever.</p>

<p>We always look to history for a confirmation of our
beliefs, and let us glance now to the records of the past
and learn her teachings.</p>

<p>First of all, look at the duel as the mode of settling
a personal difficulty if peaceful settlement appeared impossible.
First, it was heartily accepted as a gentlemanly,
honorable, and brave mode of settlement. Then, tolerated
and simply suffered to exist. Finally, condemned
by conscience as an immorality and a sin, it was banished
from civilized nations.</p>

<p>Look also at slavery. At first heartily accepted as a
divine arrangement. Then tolerated by the world as
undesirable, yet not necessarily wrong. Next its overthrowal
attempted on grounds of pity and of reason;
until finally, recognized as an immorality and a sin, it
too was blotted from the pages of civilization.</p>

<p>No great uplift of humanity, no great movement in
civilization, but has found its path to success in the
developed moral sense of man. No great change in
civilized institutions but has found itself produced by
the dynamic, moving forces of morality.</p>

<p>War must be abolished. Only the great powers of
morality are vital enough, are dynamic and powerful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Page 156]</a></span>
enough, to carry out our peace program. These forces
lie dormant, and simply need stimulation and development.
Recognizing the impotency of appeals to economy
and to reason, what are we going to do?</p>

<p>In the name of humanity let us impeach war and the
war spirit. It is a traitor to every ideal of civilization
and of justice. It is the instrument of hatred and of
pride, the agent of jealousy and of avarice. In the name
of the dead and dying, in the name of justice, which it
dethrones, in the name of those whose loved ones it
demands, we impeach war as a traitor, guilty of all high
crimes and misdemeanors. What else shall we do? Stir
up from its greatest depths the heart of man. Educate
his conscience till he is unwilling to suffer war to exist.
Begin early in Church, school, and home to instil in the
minds of young and old continually the true conception
of war, that it is an immorality, contrary to every principle
of Christianity and to every teaching of our Christ.</p>

<p>Let us bring into the conflict against war the great,
dynamic, motive force&mdash;the Moral Nature of Man.
And when we shall have thus developed the consciences
of men, there will henceforth be laid up for us a crown
of victory, as there will then be a fuller realization that
in man's moral nature is the Hope of Universal Peace.</p>

<h2>THE TASK OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY</h2>

<p>Age by age, civilization advances. Each successive era
has contributed that invention or accomplished that
achievement which has placed another round in the
great ladder of civilization. The development of many
small states into powerful nations, and many wonderful
improvements in other fields, such as steam navigation,
the railroad, the telegraph, and wireless communication,
crown the last as the greatest of centuries in the history
of the human family. It is difficult to understand why
the human mind, whence these mighty inspirations originated,
has been incapable of realizing that there still
remains the most degrading, the most deteriorating, the
foulest blot that ever disgraced this world&mdash;the killing
of civilized men, by men, as a permissible mode of settling
international disputes. This world can never attain
its highest standard of civilization until this one
disgraceful blemish, called war, is obliterated. It is the
collective task of the people living in this twentieth
century to bring into reality the millennium of Tennyson,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
Till the war drum throbs no longer, and the battle-flags are furl'd<br />
In the Parliament of Man, the Federation of the World.<br />
</p></div>

<p>The beginning of this social task, then, is the enlightenment
of the peoples as to the immorality, waste, and
ineffectiveness of war. God commanded, "Thou shalt
not kill." Who shall presume to declare that this precept
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Page 160]</a></span>
was directed not to nations but to individuals only?
that one man shall not kill, but nations may? We are
horrified at the report of a single murder, yet, if viewed
from the light of truth, what is war but wholesale murder?
What tongue, what pen, can describe the bloody
havoc of the battle of Gettysburg, where, between the
rise and set of a single sun, fifty thousand of our fellow
men sank to earth, dead or wounded?</p>

<p>What sentiment in human hearts which needs to be
perpetuated sent rank after rank, column after column,
of blue soldiers against the impregnable stone wall of
Fredericksburg? And who will place the blame for the
carnage of Cold Harbor elsewhere than upon the folly
of misguided patriotism and cruel, selfish interests that
made the bloody battle possible?</p>

<p>Every soldier is connected, as all of us, by dear ties
of kindred, love, and friendship. Perhaps there is an aged
mother, who fondly hoped to lean her bending form on
his more youthful arm; perhaps a young wife, whose
life is entwined inseparably with his; perchance a sister,
a brother. But as he falls on the field of battle, must
not all these suffer? His aged mother surely falls with
him. His young wife is suddenly widowed, his children
orphaned. That husband's helping hand is forever stayed.
A parent's voice is stilled, and the children's plaintive
cries for their loving father fall on unheeding ears. Tell
me, friends, you who know the bitterness of parting with
dear ones whom you watched tenderly through the last
hopeful moments, can you measure your anguish? Yet,
what a contrast! Your dear ones departed soothed by
kindness and love, while the dying soldier gasped out
his life on the battlefield alone.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Page 161]</a></span>
And what a waste is war! We are just beginning to
realize the tremendous cost, the incalculable wastefulness,
not only of actual war but of the preparation for future
possible wars. For the current fiscal year ending June 30,
1914, the United States has appropriated in round numbers
$535,000,000, in preparation for future wars and
because of wars fought in the past. Sixty-seven cents
out of every dollar expended by our national government
goes to feed the present-day mania for war, present
and past, leaving only thirty-three cents out of
each dollar for the combined expense of the executive,
legislative, and judicial departments of our national
government. When we realize that the cost of a single
battleship exceeds the total value of all the grounds
and buildings of all the colleges and universities in the
state of Kansas, the figures indicating this expense have
more meaning to us. And when we reflect that the
cost of a single shot from one of the great guns of
that battleship is $1700, enough to send a young man
through college, the common man realizes that the
United States cannot afford to go to war or even
prepare for war.</p>

<p>And all this suffering and cost are to no purpose.
War is utterly ineffectual to secure or advance its professed
object. The wretchedness it involves contributes
to no beneficial result, helps to establish no right, and,
therefore, in no respect promotes harmony between the
contending nations.</p>

<p>When the Saviour was born, angels from heaven sang
to the children of the human family this benediction:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
Glory to God in the highest,<br />
Peace on earth, good will toward men.<br />
</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Page 162]</a></span>
And at last, in the beginning of this twentieth century,
nations seem to be visibly approaching that unity so
long hoped and prayed for; and that nation which shall
precede all others in the abolition of war will be crowned
by history with everlasting honor. The risk will be very
little, the gain incalculable.</p>

<p>We are coming to believe that the most significant
fact about man and his civilization is their improvability.
Individual inventive genius has added improvement after
improvement until it would seem that man's mastery over
nature is to be well-nigh complete as these ideas and inventions
are socialized and extended to benefit all. We
are now entering the era of social achievement when
mankind unitedly undertakes by organization and co&ouml;peration
mightier tasks than ever accomplished before. Many
dreadful diseases are disappearing before preventive medicine,
and sanitary science is eliminating many plagues;
pestilence is coming to be a thing of the past. Human
welfare is now the concern of co&ouml;perative mankind, and
social science will condemn and banish war or fail to
establish itself as an applied science. It <i>can</i> be done!
It <i>ought</i> to be done! It <i>will</i> be done!</p>

<p>And although this consummation seems to many far
away, it may be accomplished by very simple methods.
It only waits the time of concerted action on the part of
the leading nations when the principles of arbitration
can be invoked more fully, and a world-court established
with plenary powers for settling all disputes between
the nations.</p>

<p>International legislation has occurred repeatedly,
though no world-court has as yet been established. In
the case of the Universal Postal Union we have what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Page 163]</a></span>
is tantamount to world-legislation, in that all civilized
nations have entered into a formal agreement regarding
the delivery of mail. Another instance of practical world-legislation
is that of the International Bureau of Weights
and Measures. Many other examples might be given in
which several nations are parties to an agreement regarding
some important measure, such as the respect paid to
the flag of truce, the regulations concerning commerce
on the high seas, and the etiquette of diplomacy. Paramount
in world-importance has been the agreement of
the leading nations of the world in the establishment of
the Hague conferences for the amelioration of war.</p>

<p>Since a conference of nations can meet and decide on
the mitigation of the horrors of war, it is certainly conceivable
that a tribunal of nations can prevent war.
Such a tribunal would in no respect differ from the
Supreme Court of the United States in its fundamental
foundations. As our Supreme Court is final in settling
all disputes in this country, so the international court
would be final in adjusting all controversies between the
nations. And such a court is clearly the next decisive
step in the promotion of this great task of securing
world-peace.</p>

<p>If nations can agree to establish war as their arbiter
of peace, why can they not establish a more peaceful
substitute? It is possible, for there is nothing in the
nature of strife that cannot be settled, no quarrel that
cannot be judged, no difficulty that cannot be satisfactorily
adjusted.</p>

<p>With the establishment of a true world-court, there
would rise on the vision of the nations for the first time
the prospect of justice for the united whole of mankind.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Page 164]</a></span>
Justice to the smaller countries would be secured; encroachments
by the strong upon the weak would be prevented;
the moral standard of politics would be uplifted;
and though every step would be exposed to the selfishness,
corruption, and love of despotism that are prevalent
in all men, yet is it not reasonable to suppose that,
as progress is now being made in the various nations
for overcoming these evils, so it would be made in this
united whole, to the unspeakable benefit of mankind?</p>

<p>This country has been foremost in the promotion of
this great movement to organize the world. It is especially
fitting that the United States should take the lead.
The greatest nation having a government of the people
and by the people, with the longest experience and the
greatest success, is best fitted to lead others. We have
the form of national government which foreshadows the
form of world-government. Theoretically, our states are
sovereign; all rights which are not formally surrendered
by accepting the Constitution of the United States are
reserved to them. In a like manner, referring to the
establishment of a world-court, the nations individually
will be expected to surrender to the nations collectively
only such jurisdiction as pertains to the settling of
their controversies.</p>

<p>A world-court would appeal to the strongest, the purest,
and the deepest thinkers of every race. It would
cover a new field, appealing to reason and altruism and
justice. It would by its very effect upon individuals
tend to develop the qualities it demands, and would
prove a mighty influence for uplifting the intellectual
and moral standards not only of men but nations. It
would by its very international nature annihilate all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Page 165]</a></span>
national antipathies and promote an era of universal
good will and genuine understanding.</p>

<p>To send a husband or father, glorious in the perfection
of physical manhood, out on the field of carnage to be
slain in an effort to settle international difficulty or to
uphold fancied national honor, is unquestionable barbarism.
It is far more humane to terminate disputed
questions by arbitration than by the keen-edged sword.
International peace compacts can hold mankind together
by unbreakable yet unburdensome bonds and greatly
promote prosperity and social progress. The wanton woe
and waste that inevitably follow in the train of war will
soon be things of the past. The twentieth century, already
so full of radiant promise, so enlivened by a new
social conscience, will devote its collective energies to
the abolition of war and the substitution of its successor&mdash;a
world-court, based on the facts of humane solidarity
and the principles of international peace.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Page 169]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE PRESENT STATUS OF INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION</h2>


<p>The first concerted effort looking toward an eventual world-wide peace
was the Hague Conference of 1899, where representatives of twenty-six
nations assembled in response to a rescript from the Czar of Russia,
whose avowed purpose, as set forth in the rescript, was to discuss
ways and, if possible, devise means, to arrest the alarming increase
in expenditures for armaments which threatened to bankrupt the
national governments.</p>

<p>Unable to accomplish anything definite in this respect because of the
vigorous opposition headed by Germany, the delegates turned their
attention toward giving official recognition and concrete form to
ideas which had already obtained in the settlement of international
disputes, and toward the formation of a court before which the nations
might have their differences adjudicated. The principles embodied in
good offices and mediation and commissions of inquiry have given
gratifying evidence of their efficiency, each in its respective
capacity. The original achievement of the conference, however, was the
Permanent Court of Arbitration. The composition of this court was to
include not more than four persons from each of the signatory powers;
from which panel, in case of an appeal to arbitration, each party was
to select two judges, who, in turn, should elect their own umpire
unless otherwise provided by the disputants. That it would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Page 170]</a></span>
be subject to criticism might have been expected. That twenty-six nations
could unanimously agree upon any court whatever was the real occasion for
surprise. The four cases arbitrated during the eight years intervening
between this and the Second Hague Conference served to bring out its
defects, chief of which were its decentralized and intangible nature.
Nominally a court, in reality it was but a panel scattered all over
the world from which a court could, with great difficulty and expense,
be selected. Nominally permanent, in reality it had to be re-created
for each case to be judged.</p>

<p>The Second Hague Conference, working on a basis of this short
experience, undertook to remedy these inherent defects in the arbitral
machinery by leaving the Permanent Court just as it was, and by
creating besides an International Court of Prize to serve a special
function indicated by its name, and a court of Judicial Arbitration to
supplement the work of, if not eventually to supplant, the former
court. To insure greater impartiality and also to encourage the weaker
powers the expenses of the new court, instead of falling upon the
litigants in each case, were to be prorated among the ratifying
powers. To insure greater tangibility and permanency the new court was
to be composed of only seventeen members, each to serve a term of
twelve years at a salary of $2400 per annum, with an additional $40
for each day of actual service. Furthermore, the court was to meet
once a year and to elect each year a delegation of three of its
members to sit at The Hague for settling minor cases arising in the
interval between regular sessions, having the power also to call extra
sessions of the entire court whenever occasion should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Page 171]</a></span>
demand. To insure a more judicial personnel the convention specifies
that members shall be qualified to hold high legal posts in their
respective countries. The method by which members of the court were to
be appointed&mdash;the one point upon which the delegates were unable
to agree&mdash;was deferred for subsequent determination.</p>

<p>This, in addition to the one hundred and fifty-odd treaties privately
entered into by two or more nations, many of which contain pledges to
submit certain classes of disputes to the Permanent Court, is, in
brief, what has been accomplished by way of constructive political
organization by the modern peace movement.</p>

<p>How much does this signify? In view of the present attitude of the
social mind, what are we to infer from this as bearing upon the
ultimate outcome of international arbitration? It shall be the purpose
of this paper to answer that question.</p>

<p>In an address before the Mohonk Conference of 1911 Dr. Cyrus Northrup,
ex-president of the University of Minnesota, said: "What is really
wanted is not continued talking in favor of peace with the idea of
converting the people; for the people are already converted! They are
ready for peace and arbitration!" In the October number of the <i>Review
of Reviews</i> for 1909, Privy Councillor Karl von Stengel, one of the
German delegation to the First Hague Conference, is quoted as follows:
"It must be stated emphatically that in its ultimate aims the peace
movement is not only ... Utopian, but ... dangerous...." These
quotations are given as typical of the attitude manifested by the two
extremes, the injudiciously optimistic and the ultraconservative,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Page 172]</a></span>
toward every social reform. All true progress pursues a course
intermediate to these two.</p>

<p>The idea entertained by so many enthusiastic peace advocates, that the
world is ready for peace if we but had institutional facilities
adequate to carry out the will of the people, is erroneous. In all
democratic states political institutions are but a concrete expression
of the social mind, the media created by the people, through which
society executes its will. "With a given phase of human character ...
there must go an adapted class of institutions."<a name="FNanchor_1_11" id="FNanchor_1_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_11" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Therefore, I submit that if the people were ready for peace they
could easily provide the means necessary for its accomplishment.</p>

Herbert Spencer, "The Study of Sociology."</p></div>

<p>The first gentleman quoted above drew his conclusion from the
indications that of the two million inhabitants of his state, one
million nine hundred thousand would favor arbitration as shown by the
enthusiasm manifested at a meeting of the state peace society a few
weeks before. Similar conditions in other parts of the country, he
thought, would corroborate the application of his assertion to the
entire country. Such a conclusion is fallacious in that it fails to
consider three essential facts about the people of the United States
which largely determine the attitude of any people toward war. First,
they have no grievance. Second, no appeal is being made to their
patriotic bias. Third, their emotions and passions are quiescent.</p>

<p>The first of these needs only brief mention. No people in this enlightened
age wishes to fight as a matter of course, regardless of any reasonable
pretext. If nations never had any personal interests involved, there would,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Page 173]</a></span>
of course, be no more war. In this respect the people of the United
States are not ahead of the other parts of the civilized world. Disinterested
parties have been in favor of peace for two thousand years.</p>

<p>The other two facts deserve more extended consideration.</p>

<p>The disposition in individuals to pluck motes out of their neighbors'
eyes and leave beams in their own, in the nation becomes what Herbert
Spencer calls the bias of patriotism. According to him patriotism is
but an extended self-interest. We love our country because our own
interests and our country's interests are one. Unable to view
international affairs apart from national interests, we are
handicapped in making those balanced judgments necessary to judicial
arbitration. An act reprehensible under the Union Jack becomes
patriotic under the Stars and Stripes. At both Hague Conferences all
the powers were seemingly in favor of curtailing expenditures for
armaments. The unprecedented increase in expenditures which followed
bespeaks their sincerity, or, rather, bespeaks each nation's mistrust
of the sincerity of others. A number of years ago the Farmers'
Alliance, organized in some of the Southern tobacco states, voted to
reduce the acreage of tobacco for a given year in order to raise the
price. So many members tried to profit by this opportunity to realize
a high price for a big crop that there was a greater acreage planted
that year than ever before. Can we expect better of groups than of the
individuals of which the groups are composed? Most nations question
the justice of Russia's policy leading up to the war with Japan, England's
course in South Africa, and America's attitude toward the Philippines; yet the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Page 174]</a></span>
body of citizens of each of these three countries, while concurring in
the general opinion concerning the other two, justifies its own
government's actions with patriotic pride.</p>

<p>The chief respect in which this bias interferes with the progress of
international arbitration is in restricting the scope of general
arbitration treaties, the average formula of such treaties excluding
all questions which involve "national honor and vital interests." A
greatly modified survival of the spirit which in primitive peoples
regarded the tribe over the mountain or across the stream as a fit
object of hatred and fear, the objection to a judicial settlement of
such questions assumes that a nation's honor and vital interests are
goods peculiar in that they may be inconsistent with justice. The
attitude of the United States toward the recently proposed treaty
between England and America may be taken as typical of the attitude
which prevails on this subject generally. The formulators of the
treaty took an advanced step in that, instead of reserving questions
of national honor and vital interests, they provided for the
arbitration of all differences which are "justiciable in their nature
by reason of being susceptible of decision by the application of
principles of law or equity," thereby recognizing the judicial nature
of arbitration. The action of the Senate, however, which sustained the
opinion of the majority report of the Senate Committee on Foreign
Relations, objecting to the last clause of Article III of the
treaty,<a name="FNanchor_1_12" id="FNanchor_1_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_12" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Page 175]</a></span>
would indicate that the significance of a general arbitration treaty
attaches not so much to the definition of its scope as to who shall
determine what cases conform to the definition. It would seem that the
nature of the reservation is relatively unimportant so long as its
interpretation devolves upon the parties at variance. The majority
report, objecting to the delegation to the joint high commission of
the power to determine the arbitrability of cases in terms of the
treaty, contains this statement<a name="FNanchor_1_13" id="FNanchor_1_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_13" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
in which the minority report likewise concurs: "Every one agrees that
there are certain questions which no nation ... will ever submit to
the decision of any one else." As cases of this nature it enumerates
territorial integrity, admission of immigrants, and our Monroe
Doctrine. The significance of this insistence upon a means of evasion
is evident. There is not yet enough international confidence. The
powers are not yet ready to submit to unlimited arbitration.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_12" id="Footnote_1_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_12"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
The clause, referring to the commission of inquiry, reads:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is further agreed, however, that in cases in which the Parties
disagree as to whether or not a difference is subject to arbitration
under Article I of this Treaty, that question shall be submitted to
the Joint High Commission of Inquiry; and if all or all but one of the
members of the Commission agree and report that such difference is
within the scope of Article I, it shall be referred to arbitration in
accordance with the provisions of this treaty."&mdash;<i>Editor.</i></p></div>
</div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_13" id="Footnote_1_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_13"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
See Senate Document 98, 62d Cong., 1st Sess., 9-10.&mdash;<i>Editor.</i></p></div>

<p>The other enemy to rational judgment&mdash;and rational judgment must be
the only basis of arbitration&mdash;is the danger of emotionalism. The
average man is yet largely irrational. When cool and self-possessed,
and when his prejudices and traditions do not interfere, he can pass
rational judgment upon questions in which his own interests are not
concerned; but when his passions are aroused he dispenses with any
effort to reason and acts in obedience to blind impulse. He knows that
it is expensive to fight, that it is dangerous, and that it is wrong;
but when he is provoked, he fights. The characteristics of the average
man are the characteristics of society. We have not yet outgrown the mob.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Page 176]</a></span>
Interwoven with this impulsive temperament and associated with some of
the most cherished affections of the human heart is the spirit of war,
developed by thousands of generations of ancestral conflict and passed
on to us as a heritage to be rooted out of our nature before we shall
realize in its fullness the ideal for which we strive. Mortal conflict
sanctified by religion, devastation idealized by literature, pillage
justified by patriotism, fellow-destruction ennobled by
self-sacrifice&mdash;these form a complex of contradictory emotions from
which men are as yet unable to unravel the one essential
characteristic of war; namely, the attempt to dispense justice in a
trial by battle, and make it stand out in its revealed inconsistency,
dissociated from its traditional concomitants of which it is neither
part nor parcel. The romance of knighthood and chivalry still appeals
to the human heart, notwithstanding the fact that war, love, and
religion, the knight's creed, are an inconsistent combination. Most
men can be made to see this in their minds, but cannot be made to feel
it in their souls. Many old Civil War veterans, who would not consent
for their sons to volunteer in the Spanish-American War, would have
gone themselves had they been able. Some did go. To men so disposed it
is useless to talk of the horrors of war. Give us a just grievance;
let some competent enthusiast inflame this passion with a war cry like
"Remember the Maine," "Fifty-four forty or fight," "Liberty or death,"
and, re&euml;nforced by the animal inherent in man, it will arouse popular
demonstrations devoid of all reason, creating a force that cannot be
controlled by a cold, calculating intellect. Can you listen to a bugle
call on a clear, still night without a quickening of the pulse
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Page 177]</a></span>
as there flashes through your soul a suggestion of all past history with
its marshaling hosts and heroic deeds? Can you see a military parade
without a suggestion of "Dixie" and the Star Spangled Banner, or
feeling your bosom swell with patriotic pride? This association may
be, and doubtless is, a delusion, but it is a delusion developed and
fortified by thousands of years of custom and precedent and it would
be contrary to the history of human progress if man should become
disillusionized in one generation. It may take centuries. If we are to
have international arbitration in the near future, we must have it in
spite of this spirit of war rather than by destroying the spirit. In
fact, the only practical way to destroy it is to let it, like
vestigial organs of which biologists tell us, degenerate from disuse.
This inherited emotional tendency remains as a threat with which we,
as exponents of arbitration, must reckon before we are justified in
saying that the world is ready for peace.</p>

<p>Because of these two social characteristics&mdash;the patriotic bias which
perverts judgment, and uncontrolled passions which submerge
reason&mdash;the educational propagandists still have a task to perform.</p>

<p>Let us now examine the stand-pat idea that unlimited arbitration is
but a dream as expressed in the quotation from Privy Councillor
Stengel. This is farther from the truth than the other extreme just
discussed. He who will, with an unprejudiced mind, examine cross
sections of history at widely separated stages, cannot fail to see
that along with the growing tendency of reason to predominate over
passion, superstition, and custom there has been a parallel tendency
to restrict militarism as a social activity. From a war conceived as
religion to war
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Page 178]</a></span>
as patriotism, then war as commercialism and the tool
of ambition, man is now coming to the more rational conception of war
as the despoiler of nations. David speaks of the "season of the year"
when nations went forth to battle. Fifteen hundred years later
governments pretended at least to justify their military operations on
rational grounds. To-day war is the last resort, and even its most
ardent defenders do not attempt to justify it except in disputes which
involve national honor and vital interests.</p>

<p>In view of the foregoing facts it is evident that the modern peace
movement has by no means the whole of the task to perform. Rather, we
can almost justify ourselves in the assumption that war is not long to
remain one of our social inconsistencies and that it is now making its
last, and, therefore, most determined, stand on questions of national
honor and vital interests.</p>

<p>Among the numerous forces contributing to this evolution of
international peace, the chief agencies have been, and still are,
moral and industrial. These same forces are working to-day with
cumulative effect.</p>

<p>Warfare is becoming more and more inconsistent with the ethical spirit
of the times. Men may talk of the expenses, horrors, and devastations
of war as paramount causes for the tendency to substitute arbitration;
but antedating all other causes, underlying and strengthening all
others, is the slowly changing social conscience which, as each
generation passes, appreciates more fully warfare's inconsistency with
justice and antagonism to right. This same cause found civilized
society taking keen delight in the heathen barbarity of a gladiatorial
combat, and has transformed and lifted it up to where
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Page 179]</a></span>
it is horrified at a bull-baiting or a prize fight. It found human
beings with absolute power of life and death over other human beings
and has evolved the view that all men are created free and equal. It
found individuals settling questions of honor by a resort to arms, and
has substituted therefor a judge, counsel, and a jury. These three
institutions&mdash;gladiatorial combats, slavery, and
dueling&mdash;were no more regarded in their day as only temporary
phenomena of social evolution than is war so regarded by military
sympathizers of to-day; yet these have one by one been eliminated, and
war is fast becoming as much out of harmony with the ethical spirit of
this age as was each of the above out of harmony with the spirit of
the age which dispensed with it, and the effort to demonstrate that
war is just as dispensable is meeting with success. The teachings of
Christ, who two thousand years ago announced the doctrine of human
brotherhood and surrendered his life to make this doctrine effective,
have slowly but surely wrought their leavening influence upon the
source of all war; namely, the hearts of men. Warfare has for
centuries been gradually yielding to this deepening consciousness and
that it must eventually, if not soon, take its place beside the
long-discarded gladiatorial profession, the outlawed slave trade, and
the discountenanced custom of the duelist must be evident to any one
who takes more than a superficial view of the great determining forces
which shape human progress.</p>

<p>Besides moral forces, industrial forces were mentioned as a factor
tending to the adoption of arbitration. During recent times, under the
impetus caused by the relatively modern innovations of steam, electricity, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Page 180]</a></span>
press, this class of causes has been unusually
effective. Industry has overstepped international boundary lines.
Through the division of labor we are passing from the independence of
nations to the interdependence of nations. International banking,
transportation, and commerce, by establishing communities of interest
in all parts of the world, are binding the peoples of the earth into
one great industrial organization. As striking evidence of this
development, more than one hundred and fifty international
associations<a name="FNanchor_1_14" id="FNanchor_1_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_14" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
and more than thirty-five international unions of
states have been formed. The modern intricate system of communication
is a veritable nervous system which, in the event of any local
paralysis or upheaval, informs the entire industrial organism. The
figure is no longer "the shot heard, round the world," but becomes
"the pulse-beat felt, round the world." If Spencer's definition of
patriotism&mdash;that is, coextensive with personal interests&mdash;is correct,
the bias of patriotism cannot retard the progress of arbitration much
longer, for patriotism will be a world-wide feeling, since personal
interests are no longer restricted to nationality.</p>

"Annuaire de la Vie Internationale," 1910-1911, reports on 510.&mdash;<i>Editor.</i></p></div>

<p>No, Herr Stengel, each passing year finds the causes which make for
war weakened and the causes which make for arbitration proportionately
re&euml;nforced. The skeptics are the dreamers and the peace workers are
the practical men of affairs.</p>

<p>From the foregoing synopsis of the technical accomplishments of the
modern peace movement to date, and from the effort to interpret their
significance in the light of fundamental social characteristics and
the present social attitude, I trust three things have become evident:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Page 181]</a></span>
<i>First.</i> The movement for international peace through arbitration, far
from being a mere bubble on the surface of society to be burst by the
first war cloud which appears on the horizon, is a movement, centuries
old, coincident with social evolution, deep-rooted in the very nature
of a developing world-wide civilization.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> International peace through arbitration is not to be a
ready-made affair, coming in on the crest of some wave of popular
enthusiasm as was expected by many in 1899.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> Being an outgrowth of the natural laws of human development,
a result so much deeper and more fundamental than political laws can
produce, international peace through arbitration may be furthered, but
cannot be accomplished, by legislation; may be delayed, but cannot be
prevented, by the neglect to legislate. To undertake to hasten
arbitration by forcing legislative proceedings beyond what the people
will indorse, would be as futile as to turn up the hands of the clock
to hasten the passage of time.</p>

<p>To those who can appreciate these facts there is no occasion for
discouragement in the suspicious attitude manifested by the powers
toward any definite step in the direction of unrestricted arbitration,
apparently so inconsistent with their general pacific professions.
"Rapid growth and quickly accomplished reforms are necessarily
unsound, incomplete, and disappointing."<a name="FNanchor_1_15" id="FNanchor_1_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_15" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_15" id="Footnote_1_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_15"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
F. H. Giddings, "The Elements of Sociology."</p></div>

<p>With the truth of these deductions granted, it would seem safe to assume
that the institutions for the settlement of international difficulties will
develop in much the same way as have the institutions for the settlement
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Page 182]</a></span>
of difficulties between individuals. It should be profitable,
therefore, to compare the present growth of arbitration with the
evolution and decay of the various modes of trial as the idea of
judicial settlement diffused itself through the mind of the English
people causing established forms to give way to something better.
Dispensing with the blood feud, which hardly deserves the name of
trial, the oldest form of such institution was trial by ordeal which,
according to Thayer in his "Evidence at the Common Law," seems to have
been "indigenous with the human creature in the earliest stages of his
development." This form gradually fell into disuse before the more
rational form of compurgation introduced into Teutonic courts in the
fifth century. In 1215 it was formally abolished. Compurgation was
abolished in 1440 as its inferiority to trial by witnesses became
fully recognized. In the latter form, instituted early in the ninth
century, when the witnesses disagreed the judicial talent of the day
conceived of no other method of decision than to fight it out. Thus we
have trial by witnesses and trial by battle developing concurrently,
although they were recognized as distinct forms. After two centuries
of effort to abolish it, trial by battle was made illegal in 1833, the
last case recorded as being so decided occurring in 1835. Out of the
trial by witnesses has evolved our modern trial by jury, at first
limited to certain unimportant cases, then having its sphere extended
as its superiority became more evident, until finally it superseded
all other forms and to-day is the accepted mode of settling even
questions of honor.</p>

<p>The growth and extension of international arbitration has not been
dissimilar to this. Six cases were arbitrated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Page 183]</a></span>
in the eighteenth century, four hundred and seventy-one in the
nineteenth, while more than one hundred and fifty cases have been
arbitrated during the first thirteen years of the twentieth century.
Between the First and Second Hague Conferences only four uses were
submitted to the Permanent Court of Arbitration. Since the Second
Conference, notwithstanding the unsatisfactory disposition of the
Venezuelan affair, eight cases have been tried, a ninth is pending, a
tenth will soon be docketed if the United States is not to act the
hypocrite in her international relations by refusing to submit to
England's request to arbitrate the question as to whether or no we
exempt our coastwise vessels from toll duty through the Panama Canal.
Defects have been detected in the Permanent Court of Arbitration and
we are well on the way toward a better court. Representatives of only
twenty-six nations took part in the deliberations of the First Hague
Conference; representatives of forty-four nations took part in the
deliberations of the Second Hague Conference. Wars of aggression and
conquest, though not formally outlawed, are effectively so, and
arbitration for the recovery of contract debts is now practically
obligatory. As time passes and its feasibility gains credence,
arbitration, like the jury trial, will extend its sphere of usefulness
until it too settles questions of honor. Nor need we imply from this
analogy that it will take such an age to accomplish this result.
Because of the increased mobility of society, resulting from the greater
like-mindedness and consciousness of kind incident to our modern
communities of interests and systems of communication, and from our
greater susceptibility to rational rather than traditional appeals, a reform
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Page 184]</a></span>
can be wrought more easily and the people can adjust themselves to the
change far more readily than several centuries ago.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind, then, our attempted analysis of counter social forces
at work, our deductions from this analysis and the foregoing analogy
the significance of which grows out of the truth of these deductions,
let us conclude with a suggestion as to what the next Hague Conference
should attempt. It should, of course, like the former Conferences,
extract as many teeth as possible from war. As to improving our
arbitration facilities, its first task evidently should be to
determine some method whereby members of the Judicial Arbitration
Court shall be apportioned and selected. If, as has been suggested, it
is decided to use the same scheme of apportionment as that for the
International Court of Prize, the provision that each party to a case
shall have a representative on the bench should be changed so as to
provide that neither party shall have a representative on the bench.
If this court is not to be a misnomer like the Permanent Court of
Arbitration, its rulings must be in accord with the principles of
jurisprudence rather than with the spirit of compromise such a
provision would tend to produce. With this accomplished and the
Judicial Court of Arbitration put in practical working order "of free
and easy access" to the powers, it may be doubted whether anything
further can be done. If the powers can be made to agree to submit to
the court all cases growing out of the disputed interpretation of
treaties, a great advance will have been made, but it is doubtful
whether the present state of public opinion would indorse such a
progressive step. These international
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Page 185]</a></span>
legislators can do no more than provide channels through which the
spirit of international peace can exercise itself as it expands, and
the Judicial Court of Arbitration, at the optional use of the nations,
conforms admirably to this requirement. The delegates should,
therefore, avoid the universal tendency of such bodies to legislate
too much. None of these Hague Conferences can alone accomplish the
ultimate purpose of the so-called dreamers, but each Conference may be
a landmark on the upward journey toward that consummation, anticipated
by Utopians from the earliest times, foretold by prophets from Micah
and Isaiah to Robert Burns and Tennyson, labored for by practical
statesmen from Hugo Grotius to William H. Taft, when each man shall be
a native of his state and a citizen of the world.</p>

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
