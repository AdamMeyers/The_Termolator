COMMENTARY ON PLATE 47.<br>
<br>
THE SURGICAL DISSECTION OF THE PRINCIPAL BLOODVESSELS AND<br>
NERVES OF THE ILIAC AND FEMORAL REGIONS.<br>
<br>
Through the groin, as through the axilla, the principal blood vessels<br>
and nerves are transmitted to, the corresponding limb. The main artery<br>
of the lower limb frequently becomes the subject of a surgical<br>
operation. The vessel is usually described as divisible into parts,<br>
according to the regions which it traverses. But, as in examining any<br>
one of those parts irrespective of the others, many facts of chief<br>
surgical importance are thereby obscured and overlooked, I propose to<br>
consider the vessel <span style="font-style: italic;">as a whole</span>,
continuous from the aorta to where it<br>
enters the popliteal space. The general course and position of the main<br>
artery may be described as follows:--The abdominal aorta, A, bifurcates<br>
on the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra. The level of the aortic<br>
bifurcation corresponds with the situation of the navel in front, and<br>
the crista ilii laterally. The aorta is in this situation borne so far<br>
forwards by the lumbar spine as to occupy an almost central position in<br>
the cavity of the abdomen. If the abdomen were pierced by two lines, one<br>
extending from a little to the left side of the navel, horizontally<br>
backwards to the fourth lumbar vertebra, and the other from immediately<br>
over the middle of one crista ilii, transversely to a corresponding<br>
point in the opposite side, these lines would intersect at the aortic<br>
bifurcation. The two arteries, G G,* into which the aorta divides<br>
symmetrically at the median line, diverge from one another in their<br>
descent towards the two groins. As both vessels correspond in form and<br>
relative position, the description of one will serve for the other.<br>
<br>
While the thigh is abducted and rotated outwards, if a line be drawn<br>
from the navel to a point, D, of the inguinal fold, midway between B,<br>
the anterior iliac spine, and C, the symphysis pubis, and continued<br>
thence to the inner condyle of the femur, it would indicate the general<br>
course of the artery, G I W. In this course, the vessel may be regarded<br>
as a main trunk, giving off at intervals large branches for the supply<br>
of the pelvic organs, the abdominal parietes, and the thigh. From the<br>
point where the vessel leaves the aorta, A, down to the inguinal fold,<br>
D, it lies within the abdomen, and here, therefore, all operations<br>
affecting the vessel are attended with more difficulty and danger than<br>
elsewhere, in its course.<br>
<br>
The artery of the lower limb, arising at the bifurcation of the aorta on<br>
the fourth lumbar vertebra, descends obliquely outwards to the<br>
sacra-iliac junction, and here it gives off its first branch, G,<br>
(internal iliac,) to the pelvic organs. The main vessel is named <span
 style="font-style: italic;">common</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">iliac</span>, at the interval between
its origin from the aorta and the point<br>
where it gives off the internal iliac branch. This interval is very<br>
variable as to its length, but it is stated to be usually two inches.<br>
The artery, I, continuing to diverge in its first direction from its<br>
fellow of the opposite side, descends along the margin of the true<br>
pelvis as far as Poupart's ligament, D, where it gives off its next<br>
principal branches,--viz., the epigastric and circumflex iliac. At the<br>
interval between the internal iliac and epigastric branches, the main<br>
artery, I, is named <span style="font-style: italic;">external iliac</span>;
and the surgical length of this part<br>
is also liable to vary, in consequence of the epigastric or circumflex<br>
iliac branches arising higher up or lower down than usual. The main<br>
vessel, after passing beneath the middle of Poupart's ligament, D, next<br>
gives off the profundus branch, N, to supply the thigh. This branch<br>
generally arises at a point an inch and half or two inches below the<br>
fold of the groin; and between it and the epigastric above, the main<br>
artery is named <span style="font-style: italic;">common femoral.</span>
From the point where the profundus<br>
branch arises, down to the popliteal space, the vessel remains as an<br>
undivided trunk, being destined to supply the leg and foot. In this<br>
course, the artery is accompanied by the vein, H K O, which, according<br>
to the region in which it lies, assumes different names, corresponding<br>
to those applied to the artery. Both vessels may now be viewed in<br>
relation to each other, and to the several structures which lie in<br>
connexion with them.<br>
<br>
The two vessels above Poupart's ligament lie behind the intestines, and<br>
are closely invested by the serous membrane. The origin of the vena<br>
cava, F, lies close to the right side of the bifurcation of the aorta,<br>
A; and here both vessels are supported by the lumbar spine. Each of the<br>
two arteries, G G,* into which the aorta divides, has its accompanying<br>
vein, H, on its inner side, but the common iliac part of the right<br>
artery is seen to lie upon the upper portions of both the veins, as<br>
these joining beneath it form the commencement of the vena cava. The<br>
external iliac part, I, of each artery has its vein, K, on its inner<br>
side. At the point, G, where the artery gives off its internal iliac<br>
branch, the ureter, <span style="font-style: italic;">g</span>,
crosses it, and thence descends to the bladder.<br>
The internal iliac branch subdivides in general so soon after its<br>
origin, that it may be regarded as for the most part an unsafe<br>
proceeding to place a ligature upon it.<br>
<br>
The iliac vessels, A G I, in approaching Poupart's ligament along the<br>
border of the true pelvis, are supported by the psoas muscle, and<br>
invested and bound to their place by the peritonaeum, and a thin process<br>
of the iliac fascia. Some lymphatic glands are here found to lie over<br>
the course of the vessels. The spermatic artery and vein, together with<br>
the genito-crural nerve, descend along the outer border of the iliac<br>
artery. When arrived at Poupart's ligament, the iliac vessels, I K,<br>
become complicated by their own branches, and also by the spermatic<br>
vessels, as these are about to pass from the abdomen through the<br>
internal inguinal ring. While passing beneath the middle of Poupart's<br>
ligament, D, the iliac artery, I, having its vein, K, close to its inner<br>
side, rests upon the inner border of the psoas muscle, and in this place<br>
it may be effectually compressed against the os pubis. The anterior<br>
crural nerve, P, which in the iliac region lies concealed by the psoas<br>
muscle, and separated by this from the vessels, now comes into view,<br>
lying on the outer side of the artery. When the vessels have passed from<br>
beneath Poupart's ligament, the serous membrane no longer covers them,<br>
but the fibrous membrane is seen to invest them in the form of a sheath,<br>
divided into two compartments, one of which (internal) receives the<br>
vein, the other the artery. The iliac vessels, in passing to the thigh,<br>
assume the name of femoral.<br>
<br>
The femoral vessels, O N W, in the upper third of the thigh traverse a<br>
triangular space, the base of which is formed by Poupart's ligament, D,<br>
whilst the sides and apex are formed by the sartorius, Q, and adductor<br>
longus muscles, T, approaching each other. In the undissected state of<br>
the part, the structures which bound this space can in general be easily<br>
recognised. A central depression extends from the middle of its base, D,<br>
to its apex, V, and marks the course of the vessels. Near the middle of<br>
Poupart's ligament, the vessels are comparatively superficial, and here<br>
the artery may be felt pulsating; but lower down, as they approach the<br>
apex of the triangle, the vessels become gradually deeper, till the<br>
sartorius muscle inclining from its origin obliquely inwards to the<br>
centre of the thigh, w, at length overlaps them. The inner border of the<br>
sartorius muscle at the lower part of the upper third of the thigh, W,<br>
guides to the position of the artery. Whilst traversing the femoral<br>
triangle, the vessels enclosed in their proper sheath are covered by the<br>
fascia lata, adipose membrane, and integument. In this place they lie<br>
imbedded in loose cellular and adipose tissue. The femoral vein, O, is<br>
on the same plane with the artery near Poupart's ligament; but from this<br>
place downwards through the thigh, the vein gradually winds from the<br>
inner to the back part of the artery; and when both vessels pass under<br>
cover of the sartorius, they enter a strong fibrous sheath, V, derived<br>
from the tendons of the adductor muscles upon which they lie. The artery<br>
approaches the shaft of the femur near its middle; and in this place it<br>
may be readily compressed against the bone by the hand. The anterior<br>
crural nerve, P, dividing on the outer side of the artery, sends some of<br>
its branches coursing over the femoral sheath; and one of these--the<br>
long saphenous nerve--enters the sheath and follows the artery as far as<br>
the opening in the great adductor tendon. The femoral artery, before it<br>
passes through this opening into the popliteal space, gives off its<br>
anastomatic branch. The profundus branch, N, springs from the outer side<br>
of the femoral artery usually at a distance of from one to two inches<br>
(seldom more) below Poupart's ligament, and soon subdivides. [Footnote]<br>
The femoral artery in a few instances has been found double.<br>
<br>
[Footnote: The ordinary length of each part of the main artery is stated<br>
on the authority of Mr. Quain. See "Anatomy of the Arteries," &amp;c. ]<br>
<br>
The main artery of the lower limb may be exposed and tied in any part of<br>
its course from the aorta to the popliteal space. But the situation most<br>
eligible for performing such an operation depends of course upon<br>
circumstances, both anatomical and pathological. If an aneurism affect<br>
the popliteal part of the vessel, or if, from whatever cause arising, it<br>
be found expedient to tie the femoral above this part, the place best<br>
suited for the operation is that where the artery, W, first passes under<br>
cover of the sartorius muscle. [Footnote]&nbsp; For, considering that
the<br>
vessel gives off no important branch destined to supply any part of the<br>
thigh or leg between the profundus branch and those into which it<br>
divides below the popliteal space, the arrest to circulation will be the<br>
same in amount at whichever part of the vessel between these two points<br>
the ligature be applied. But since the vessel in the situation specified<br>
can be reached with greater facility here than elsewhere lower down; and<br>
since, moreover, a ligature applied to it here will be sufficiently<br>
removed from the profundus branch above, and the seat of disease below,<br>
to produce the desired result, the choice of the operator is determined<br>
accordingly. The steps of the operation performed at the situation W,<br>
where the artery is about to pass beneath the sartorius, are these: an<br>
incision of sufficient length--from two to three inches--is to be made<br>
over the course of the vessel, so as to divide the skin and adipose<br>
membrane, and expose the fascia lata, through which the inner edge of<br>
the sartorius muscle becomes now readily discernible. A vein (anterior<br>
saphena) may be found to cross in this situation, but the saphena vein<br>
proper is not met with, as this lies nearer the inner side of the thigh.<br>
The fascia having been next divided, the edge of the sartorius is to be<br>
turned aside, and now the pulsation of the artery in its sheath will<br>
indicate its exact position. The sheath is next to be opened, for an<br>
extent sufficient only to carry the point of the ligature-needle safely<br>
around the artery, care being taken not to injure the femoral vein,<br>
which lies close behind it, and also to exclude any nerve which may lie<br>
in contact with the vessel.<br>
<br>
[Footnote: This is the situation chosen by Scarpa for arresting by<br>
ligature the circulation through the femoral artery in cases of<br>
popliteal aneurism. The reasons stated in the text are those which<br>
determine the surgeon to perform the operation in this place in<br>
preference to that (the lower third of the thigh) where Mr. Hunter first<br>
proposed to tie the vessel.]<br>
<br>
If an aneurism affect the common femoral portion of the artery, the<br>
external iliac part would require to be tied, because, between the seat<br>
of the tumour and the epigastric and circumflex ilii branches above,<br>
there would not be sufficient space to allow the ligature to rest<br>
undisturbed; and even if the aneurism arose from the femoral below the<br>
profundus branch in the upper third of the thigh, or if, after<br>
amputation of the thigh, a secondary haemorrhage took place from the<br>
femoral and the profunda arteries, a ligature would with more safety be<br>
applied to the external iliac part than to the common femoral; because<br>
of this latter, even when of its clear normal length, presenting so<br>
small an interval between the epigastric and profundus branches. In<br>
addition to this, it must be&nbsp; noticed, that occasionally the
profundus<br>
itself, or some one of its branches, (external and internal circumflex,<br>
&amp;c.), arises as high up as Poupart's ligament, close to the origin
of<br>
the epigastric and circumflex iliac. [Footnote]<br>
<br>
[Footnote: The main artery (Plate 47) has been exposed in the iliac and<br>
femoral regions with the object of showing the relation which its parts<br>
bear to each other and to the whole; all the other dissections have been<br>
made upon the same plan, the practical tendency of which will be<br>
illustrated when considering the subject of arterial anastomosis.]<br>
<br>
The external iliac part of the artery, G I, when requiring to be tied,<br>
may be reached in the following way: an incision, commencing above the<br>
anterior iliac spine, B, is to be carried inwards parallel to, and<br>
above, Poupart's ligament, D, as far as the outer margin of the internal<br>
abdominal ring. This incision is the one best calculated for avoiding<br>
the epigastric artery, and for not disturbing the peritonaeum more than<br>
is necessary. The skin and the three abdominal muscles having been<br>
successively incised, the fibrous transversalis fascia is next to be<br>
carefully divided, so as to expose the peritonaeum. This membrane is<br>
then to be gently raised by the fingers, from off the iliacus and psoas<br>
muscles as far inwards as the margin of the true pelvis where the artery<br>
lies. On raising the peritonaeum the spermatic vessels will be found<br>
adhering to it. The iliac artery itself is liable to be displaced by<br>
adhering to the serous membrane, when this is being detached from the<br>
inner side of the psoas muscle. [Footnote] The artery having been<br>
divested of its serous covering as far up as a point midway between I G,<br>
the epigastric and internal iliac branches, the ligature is to be passed<br>
around it in this place, as being equidistant from these two sources of<br>
disturbance. As the vein, K, lies close along the inner side of the<br>
artery, the point of the instrument should first be inserted between<br>
them, and passed from within outwards, in order to avoid wounding the<br>
vein. If an aneurism affect the upper end of the external iliac artery,<br>
it is proposed to tie the common iliac; but this is an operation of so<br>
serious a nature, that it can in this respect be exceeded only by tying<br>
the aorta itself. The common iliac artery is so situated, that it can as<br>
easily be reached from the groin upwards as from the side of the abdomen<br>
inwards, and in both directions the peritonaeum would have to be<br>
disturbed to an equal extent.<br>
<br>
[Footnote: The student, in operating upon the dead subject, is often<br>
puzzled to find that the iliac artery does not appear in its usual<br>
situation, unaware at the time that he has lifted the vessel in<br>
connexion with the peritonaeum. I have once seen a very distinguished<br>
surgeon, whilst performing this operation on the living body, at fault<br>
owing to the same cause.]<br>
