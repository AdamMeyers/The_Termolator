Globes and Globe Makers of the Early
Seventeenth Century. The Dutch
Scientific Masters and Their
Pre&euml;minent Leadership

The shifting of globe making interest to the northwest of Europe
at the close of the sixteenth century.&mdash;The Van Langrens as
leaders.&mdash;Jodocus Hondius and his son Henricus.&mdash;Willem
Jansz. Blaeu and his sons, John and Cornelius.&mdash;The Ferreri
armillary sphere.&mdash;Globes of Peter Plancius.&mdash;Isaac Habrecht.&mdash;Globes
of Mattheus Greuter and their reproduction by Rossi.&mdash;Manfredus
Sett&agrave;la.&mdash;Abraham Goos.&mdash;Adam Heroldt.

AS the first post-Columbian century came to its close
the center of interest in great transoceanic exploration
and discovery shifted to the northwest of
Europe, to England, and to the Netherlands. Since expeditions
were daily setting sail to all shores of the world,
&#8220;Quoniam in omnes mundi plagas quotidie magis magisque
navigatur,&#8221; quoting the word of the enthusiastic Hondius,
the chart and globe makers found their services in great
demand, globes both terrestrial and celestial being still regarded
as essential to a navigator&#8217;s complete outfit of sailing
instruments. The quick-witted Netherlanders, with well-developed
business instincts, engravers, printers, map and
globe makers, set to work to correct the old and to construct
new &#8220;seamen&#8217;s cards&#8221; to serve the seafarers in their enterprises,2
and it was not long after entering this field of scientific
endeavor that leadership by them was clearly attained.

Although of Danish origin, perhaps logically the Van
Langren family should have had first consideration in this
chapter, since father and sons came to be loyal supporters of
their new homeland&#8217;s interests, and it was in the Netherlands
where were laid the scenes of their activities in the
field here under consideration. Chronologically, however,
they had place in the preceding chapter because their work
as globe makers began in the early eighties of the sixteenth
century. They, at least, be it said to their credit, led the way,
achieving some of their highest successes in the early seventeenth
century. This, too, was the time when the Hondius,
the Blaeu, the Jansson, and the Goos families came to the
front to contribute their part, in a very distinguished manner,
toward the promotion of the work so ably begun by
their contemporary, Jacobus Florentius van Langren.

Jodocus Hondius (1567-1611) was a native of Wacken
(Fig. 60).1 To this village his parents, shortly before his
birth, had fled from Ghent to escape the persecuting hand
of Count Egmont. The father, Oliver de Hondt, a modest
teacher but a man very learned in theology, had embraced
the reformed faith and therefore became an outlaw by decree
of the government. On the arrest of Egmont, he with his
family returned to Ghent, to remain but a short time, for in
the year 1569 we find a residence had been taken up at
Duffel near Antwerp. In this city two children were born,
a daughter whose name is now unknown and a son Henry,
usually referred to as Henry the Elder.

Jodocus at an early age gave evidence of possessing very
remarkable talent for designing and engraving. We are told
that at the age of eight he began to apply himself to the art
of portraiture, of ivory carving, and of copper engraving,
and that his father, noting the exhibition of special talent
in the son, placed him as an apprentice with an engraver and
sculptor in Antwerp. During this period of apprenticeship3
he carried on his studies of the fine arts, also of Latin, Greek,
and mathematics, under the direction of his father, at the
same time applying himself to the work of map engraving.
It probably was about the year 1585 that he went to England,
where, by reason of the talent he exhibited, he found
employment with the English geographers, Richard Hakluyt
and Edward Wright, during which period he appears to have
engraved and printed a small world map in hemispheres. In
the year 1592 he returned to Amsterdam, where he established
himself as an engraver and printer, turning his attention
especially to the issue of geographical maps.2 Among
his friends he numbered the men most prominent in his
field, notably Petrus Bertius, very learned as a geographer,
and Petrus Montanus.3 It appears to have been Bertius who
informed him of the intention of the heirs of Mercator to
dispose of that illustrious geographer&#8217;s engraving and printing
establishment, and who perhaps negotiated the sale of
the same. At any rate, we find that in the year 1604 Jodocus
Hondius came into possession of the Mercator copper
plates of the Ptolemy maps, and at the same time he seems
also to have acquired the greater part of the edition of Mercator&#8217;s
&#8216;Atlas&#8217; of 1602 then remaining unsold. In the year
1605 Hondius prepared and issued a third edition of the
Ptolemy maps; in 1606 he issued a third edition of Mercator&#8217;s
&#8216;Atlas&#8217;; in 1608 he published a fourth edition; in
1609 and in 1610 other editions.4 It must have been in the
year 1611 that he issued his great world map in two hemispheres,
bearing the title &#8220;Novissima ac exactissima totius
orbis terrarum descriptio magna cura &amp; industria ex optimis
quibusque tabulis Geographicis et Hydrographicis nuperrimisque
doctorum virorum observationibus duobus planisphaerijs
delineata. Auct. I. Hondio.&#8221; This work has been recently
issued in a superb facsimile of the only known extant
original copy, now in the possession of Prince Maximilian
of Waldburg zu Wolfegg-Waldsee.5 Of such superior
excellence is the work of Hondius, as exhibited in this4
masterpiece, that it justly entitles him to first place among
those who, up to this date, had undertaken to construct
world maps.

It seems to have been early in his career as engraver and
printer that he prepared his first globe gores and issued
his first celestial globe. The director of the Germanisches
Nationalmuseum of N&uuml;rnberg, in courteous communication,
reports that in the rich collection of that institution there is
a Hondius globe of the year 1592, which date, if accurately
read, makes this to be the only known copy of what must
be taken as his first issue. The map is a colored copper engraving
covering a ball of wood having a diameter of 60 cm.
The mounting of the globe, which clearly is the original,
consists of the usual circles, resting upon six wooden support
columns. A more detailed description of this particular
example it has not been possible to obtain.6

Not until the year 1600 does there appear to have been
a second issue of his globes. Of this second issue a remarkably
fine pair (Figs. 88, 89) was recently acquired by Mr.
Henry E. Huntington of New York City.7 Excepting very
slight damage to the celestial globe in the north polar region,
they may be said to be in practically as fine condition as
they were when first given out from the master&#8217;s workshop.
Their complete history has not been obtainable, but so remarkably
well preserved are they that it seems quite probable
they have been kept through all these years in the
library case of some rich Italian treasure-loving family.
There cannot be the slightest doubt of their age, certainly
none of the age of the spheres themselves, but the exact date
of the bronze mounting, though clearly in the style of certain
Italian workmanship of the period, is less easy to determine.
These globes have a diameter of about 34 cm. and
an entire height, including the base, of 73 cm. The spheres
on which have been pasted the twelve engraved gores are
of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;, over which is a covering of plaster and a
coating of thick varnish or shellac giving a smooth surface
5for the terrestrial and the celestial maps. To each, color
was artistically applied by hand, which still retains a richness
of tone. Each is supplied with a bronze meridian and
horizon circle and with an hour circle attached in the accustomed
manner at the north pole. These circles are appropriately
graduated, the horizon circle having, in addition
to its graduation into three hundred and sixty degrees, a
series of concentric circles engraved, counting from the outermost,
with the names of the winds, compass directions in
the Dutch language, the names of the months, and the signs
of the zodiac. Each sphere with its circles is carried on a
base composed of three artistically designed and engraved
bronze supports, these being attached at their lower extremities
by an appropriately designed plate, and in this plate has
been set a compass, still apparently in perfect condition, the
dial face of this compass having a diameter of 8 cm. Aside
from their scientific value for the student of geography and
of astronomy, these are fit pieces to adorn the library shelves
of a prince among American book collectors, as they must,
in keeping with the custom of the time, have once adorned
the shelves of an Italian patrician book lover.

The terrestrial globe has the following dedication:
&#8220;Illustrissimo Principi Do Mauritio &agrave; Nassau, Principi
Auraico, Comiti &agrave; Nassau, etc. Gubernatori Provinciarum
Foederatar&#363; Summoque Praefecto mari Inferioris Germaniae

L. M. D. D. Cum privilegio decem annorum.&#8221; &#8220;To the
illustrious Prince D. Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange,
Knight of Nassau, etc. Governor of the Federated Provinces
and High Prefect of the Lower German Ocean, his Most
Worshipful Master, Jodocus Hondius dedicates (this globe).
With privilege for ten years.&#8221; This dedication is placed
within an artistic cartouch (Fig. 90) which is surmounted
with the coat of arms of the Princes of Nassau, to which
appropriate colors have been added. To the left of the above
is an address to the reader: &#8220;Iod. Hond. Lectori S. P.6
Quoniam crebriores in omnes mundi partes quotidie navigationes
institu&#363;us ejusdem certius perspicitur
atque innotescit; nemini idcirco mirum spero visum iri, si
haec nostri globi descriptio ab aliis antehac in lucem editis
plurim&#363; discrepet. Quin uti par est, nostrae diligentiae et
curae favebit, qua recens patefacta et cognita, qua directiones,
latitudines et similia c&#333;gruenter distincta suis locis
habentur. Quod ipsum in ducendis lineis Directorii fecimus
et peritis cumulate satisfactum confidimus. Postremo lector&#275;
benev. rogam&#8313; ut si quam loci alicujis pleniorem notitiam
habeat eandem nobisc&#363;, proveh&#275;di boni publici gratia, lubens
comunicet. vale.&#8221; &#8220;Hondius to the reader greeting. Inasmuch
as frequent voyages into all parts of the world are
undertaken every day, whereby the several locations (of
places) are more certainly seen and are made known, I hope
therefore no one will be surprised to find this delineation
on our globe very different from that on most others previously
issued. But who, as is right, will not prefer our diligence
and care, whereby recently discovered and known
lands, and whereby directions, latitudes, and such like are
all properly distinguished and are to be found in their places.
What we have done in drawing the lines of direction, we
trust will be satisfactory on the whole to experts. Finally,
we ask the kind reader that, if he has fuller knowledge of
any place, that of his own free will he will communicate
the same to us, to the end of advancing the public welfare.
Farewell.&#8221; Within the Arctic circle and north of North
America is the title and date legend reading &#8220;Globus Terrestris
de integri revisus &amp; emendatus an. 1600.&#8221; &#8220;Globe of
the entire earth revised and corrected in the year 1600.&#8221; To
the right of the dedicatory legend we find instruction given
as to the method of finding the direction from one place
to another, of which one may be desirous of having
knowledge; it reads: &#8220;Modus investigandi locor&#363; direction&#275;.
Duorum locorum in hoc globo quorum directionem
scire cupis hoc est in quam coeli partem alter ab altero vergat,7
primo longitudinis et latitudinis differentiam notabis,
qua cognita vertas globum donec Rhumbus aliquis intersecet
meridianum in latitudin&#275; primi loci, deinde volvas
versus Ortum aut Occasum, prout res postulat, donec gradus
aequatoris numero aequales differentiae longitudinis duor&#363;
locorum meridianum pertranseant postea vide num ass&#363;ptus
Rhumbus intersecet meridianum in latitudine loci. Quod si
fecerit hic est horum locor&#363; Rhumbus sive linea directionem
indicans: sin secus, alius assumendus est, usque dum occurrat
qui hoc praestiterit. Subjecimus scalam longitudinum.&#8221;
&#8220;Of two places on this globe whose direction from one
another you are desirous of knowing, that is in what part of
the heavens the one diverges from the other, first of all note
the difference of latitude and longitude. This ascertained
turn the globe until some one rhumb cuts the meridian in the
latitude of the first place, then turn to the east or to the
west as is required, until the degrees of the equator through
which the meridians of the places pass equal in number the
difference in longitude of the two places. Then note whether
the selected rhumb cuts the meridian in the latitude of the
place. If it does so then this is the rhumb of these places or
the line which shows the required direction: but if it does
not then another rhumb must be chosen until the condition
is satisfied. We subjoin a scale of longitudes.&#8221; Other legends,
describing briefly some event in the history of discovery, or
describing briefly the characteristic features of some locality,
are exceedingly numerous. As a record of the geographical
knowledge of the time, this Hondius terrestrial globe map
may justly be referred to as one of the most valuable of
the period.

Fig. 90. Dedication Appearing on Globe of Jodocus Hondius, 1600.

For astronomical study the celestial globe is none the less
valuable and interesting than is the terrestrial for the study
of geography. Its descriptive title reads: &#8220;Globus coelestis.
In quo Stellae fixae omnes quae a N. viro Tycone Brahe
s&#363;ma industria ac cura observatae sunt accuratissime designantur:
nec non ea quae a peritis. nauclero Petro Theodori.8
Mateseos studioso annotatae sunt.&#8221; &#8220;Celestial globe, in
which all of the fixed stars which were observed by the illustrious
Tycho Brahe, with great care and industry, are most
accurately shown for the scientific student: also those which
were noted by the distinguished navigator Peter Theodorus.&#8221;
The dedication differs somewhat from that on the terrestrial
globe and reads: &#8220;Clarissimis Belgii luminibus sapientiae doctrinae
et verae pietatis officinis Academiae Lugdunensis
Batavorum et Francveriensis. Hos globos ad Mathematicas
artes promovendas manu propria &agrave; se caelatas luculentissime
dedicat consacratque Jodocus Hondius ann. 1600.&#8221; &#8220;To the
most renowned lights of Belgium, fountains of wisdom, of
doctrine and of true piety, of the Academy of Leiden and
of Frankfurt these globes, for the promotion of the
mathematical arts and constructed with his own hands, are
dedicated and consecrated by Jodocus Hondius in the year
1600.&#8221; The several constellations are artistically represented
in appropriate figures which include, in addition to those
of Ptolemy, a considerable number in the southern hemisphere,
for which, as the author states, he made use of the
observations of the navigator Theodorus. That star in the
constellation Cassiopeia, which so greatly interested Tycho
Brahe, has a special but brief legend distinguishing it, reading
&#8220;Stella mirabilis quae insolito prae aliis fulgore ao 1572
p. an. et trientem apparuit.&#8221; &#8220;Remarkable star which appeared
with brightness beyond all others in the year 1572
and for a year and one third.&#8221;

A second pair of Hondius&#8217; globes of the year 1600 is
reported as belonging to Count Rocco Giannini of Lucca.
Fiorini says of them that they have mountings of bronze,
resembling in this respect the pair described above, but he
adds that they are without inscriptions of special note.8
Either the information which he received concerning them
was inaccurate or there exists a very marked difference
between these pairs, the only ones it has been possible to
locate.

9In the year 1601 Hondius issued a pair of globes which
were somewhat smaller than the preceding, each having a
diameter of 21 cm. The inscription on the celestial globe,
in which appears the date of construction, differs but little
from that appearing on the issue of the year 1600; it reads:
&#8220;Globus coelestis in quo fixae omnes quae a N. viro Thicone
Brahe sum&#772;a cura observatae sunt, accuratissime designantur
quibus adjuncta sunt circa Pol. Australe stel. quae a pertissimo
nauclero Petro Theodori. annotatae sunt simul accomodatae
ad annum 1600. editus vero 1601.&#8221; &#8220;Celestial
globe in which all the fixed stars which were observed with
the utmost care by the illustrious Tycho Brahe and accurately
noted, to which are added the stars around the south
pole which were observed by the skilful navigator Peter
Theodorus. Adapted to the year 1600, but edited in the year
1601.&#8221; The general design of the figures of the several constellations
agrees with that of the first edition, the chief
difference lying merely in the matter of size.

On the terrestrial globe is the following dedication:
&#8220;Serenissimis Principibus Alberto et Isabellae Cla. austriacis
Brabantiae Ducibus. Jodo. Hondius. auctor et Joan Baptista
Vriendt. Antuerpiae.&#8221; &#8220;To the Most Serene Rulers
Albert and Isabella, the renowned Princes of Austrian
Brabant, Jodocus Hondius author and John Baptist Veen
(dedicate this globe). Antwerp.&#8221;

The author has added a rather lengthy address to the
reader, in which is interesting reference to the difficult problem
of determining the longitude of places.9 &#8220;Hondius
Lectori S. In locorum longitudine hactenus mirifice peccatum
esse hydrographiae peritis satis constat: Regiones enim
fere omnes descriptae sunt prout naucleri in suis navigationibus
directionem duorum locorum ab uno loco ad alterum
invenerunt, idque nulla habita ratione loci tertii, vel deviationis
acus nauticae, vel etiam directorii nautici, quo indifferenter
utuntur, quamvis in uno non aeque ac in alio chalyben
ille acus ponatur, et a vero septentrione magis vel minus10
divertatur, pro uso loci in quo directoria fabbricata sunt,
unde necessario longitudo locorum distorta est. Multi hos
errores frustra conati sunt emendare per polares stellas, alii
per Lunae cursum, alii certius per eclipses. Verum hoc opus,
ille labor. Quis enim in tanta locorum multitudine eclipses
observabit? At cum jam tandem per variationem, aut deviationem
acus nauticae, ut vocant, locorum, longitudo inveniatur,
operae praetium me facturum putavi si in hoc globo
regiones omnes (saltem quarum longitudo jam cognita est)
suis quas q&#772; veris longitudinis gradibus delineavero, quamvis
id non exigui laboris fuerit. Longitudines incepimus non ab
Insulis Fortunatis ut Ptolomeus, sed ab iis quae a&ccedil;ores vocantur
quod acus nautica ibi recta in septentrionem vergat.
Vale. Anno 1601.&#8221; &#8220;Hondius to the reader greeting. In the
matter of the longitude of places all hydrographers, it is
agreed, have blundered marvelously, since nearly all regions
have been described as navigators, in their voyages, found
the direction from one to another, of any two places, without
reckoning having been taken from a third place, or account
having been taken of the variation of the nautical
needle, or even of nautical direction, which they indefinitely
make use of, although in one place the needle does not
point exactly as in another, being deflected more or less from
the true north according to the usage of the country in which
the compass card employed was made, and thus the longitude
of places is made to vary. Many have tried in vain to
eliminate these errors by the polar stars. Others have tried
to do the same by noting the course of the moon, and others
again, with more certainty, by observations of eclipses; but
all this is with much labor, and who will be able thus to
get an accurate observation? But now since the longitude of
places has been sought through the variation or deviation of
the needle, as they say, I thought it would be a work of
merit if I noted on this globe all the regions (at least all
whose longitude is known) each with its own degree of
longitude although knowing this would be no little labor.11
We have begun our reckoning of longitude not from the
Fortunate Islands, as did Ptolemy, but from those which
are called the Azores, because there the nautical needle
points directly to the north. Farewell. In the year 1601.&#8221;

These globes of 1601 are composed of a hollow wooden
shell, over which have been pasted the twelve engraved
gores. They are mounted on well-constructed bases of copper
from which rise the supports for the horizon circle, on
the surface of which are the usual graduations, the calendar
and zodiacal representations. The meridian circles are of
brass, are graduated, and have in addition the engraved
designations &#8220;Zona torrida,&#8221; &#8220;Zona temperata,&#8221; &#8220;Zona
frigida.&#8221; An example of each of these globes of 1601 may
be found in the Museo Municipale of Milan, and one of
the celestial globes in the library of the Seminario Vescovile
of Rimini.

In the year 1613, shortly after the death of Jodocus
Hondius, there was issued in Amsterdam, by Adrian Veen10
and Jodocus Hondius, Jr., a terrestrial and a celestial globe,
each having a diameter of about 56 cm. The dedication of
the first reads: &#8220;Illustrissimis, Nobilissimis, Amplissimis et
Prudentissimis Federatarum Inferioris Germaniae Provinciarum
Ordinibus ac Patribus Patriae Dominis Suis Clementissimis
Dedicabant Jodocus Hondius Junior et Adrianus
Veen. In the year 1613.&#8221; &#8220;To the Most Illustrious, Most
Noble, Most Exalted, Most Prudent Lords of the Federated
Provinces of the Netherlands, and Fathers of their Country,
their Most Benign Masters, Jodocus Hondius Jr. and
Adrian Veen dedicate (this globe).&#8221; The title of the terrestrial
globe is given as &#8220;Globus terrestris summa cura ac
diligentia a Jodoco Hondio piae memoriae inchoatus, globosis
autem directorii nautici lineis ab Adriano Venone ad
usum navigantium accomodatus, illiusque et Jodoci Hondii
junioris ope et industria absolutus atque perfactus. Amsterodami
1613.&#8221; &#8220;Terrestrial globe begun with great care and
diligence by Jodocus Hondius of pious memory, furnished12
with the lines of nautical direction (loxodromes) for the use
of navigators, by Adrian Veen, and finished by the industry
and labor of the same and of Jodocus Hondius, Jr. Amsterdam
1613.&#8221; It seems probable that the Jodocus Hondius
here referred to was Henricus Hondius, who for reasons of
business had taken the name of his father, affixing the word
&#8220;Junior.&#8221;

The celestial globe to accompany the above terrestrial has
the title, &#8220;Globus coelestis in quo stellae fixae omnes, quae
a Nob. viro Tychone Brahe summa industria ac cura observatae
sunt, accuratissima designantur, nec non circa polum
austrum eae quae a Peritiss. nauclero Petro Theodorico et
Friderico Houtmanno Mathessos studioso annotatae sunt.&#8221;
&#8220;Celestial globe on which are accurately depicted all the
fixed stars that were observed by the illustrious Tycho Brahe,
with great industry and care: also those stars around the
south pole which were noted for the scientific student by the
skilful navigator Peter Theodorus, and by Frederick Houtmann.&#8221;
Surmounting the cartouch containing the above
title is a portrait of Tycho Brahe with the legend &#8220;Effigies
Nob. viri Tychonis Brahe Dani Domini de Knudstrup.
Summi Mathematici. Aetatis 47.&#8221; &#8220;Portrait of the illustrious
Tycho Brahe, Danish Lord of Knudstrup, the great
mathematician, in his 47th year.&#8221; The dedication of this
globe differs somewhat from the former, reading, &#8220;Illustrissimis,
Amplissimis, Clarissimisque D. D. Dominis Ordinibus
Provinciarum Foederis Belgici, Don&#772;is suis Clementissimis in
assiduae Gratitudinis memoriam, Dant Dedicantque Adrianus
Veen et Jodocus Hondius Junior. Anno 1613.&#8221; &#8220;To
the Illustrious, the Great, the Renowned Lords of the Provinces
of United Belgium, their Most Benign Masters, as a
token of constant gratitude, Adrian Veen and Jodocus Hondius
Jr. give and dedicate (this globe). In the year 1613.&#8221;
There is evidence that Hondius drew from the work of
Willem Jansz. Blaeu for certain features of this edition, in
which he followed a practice of the time. Frequent complaint13
is to be met with, that this borrowing was not always
done with the proper note of credit. We find, for example,
that in the year 1608 Blaeu presented a special plea to the
States of Holland and West Friesland that he be made
secure against the loss caused by pirated editions of his
works. He informed the States that he had given himself
hope of being able to support his family in an honest way,
and that he would have succeeded with God&#8217;s mercy and
blessing, if certain individuals engaged in the same business
had not undertaken to copy his productions.11 It seems probable
that Blaeu&#8217;s complaint touched in some manner his
large world map of the year 1605, since there is striking
resemblance between this and the world map of Hondius
issued in the year 1611, and, as noted above, we find that
Jodocus Hondius&#8217; son, signing himself Jodocus Hondius,
Jr., continued to borrow from his distinguished contemporary&#8217;s
work. The practice of borrowing, however, seems
to have been later reversed, when Blaeu, undoubtedly noting
the success of Hondius&#8217; large globe of 1613, decided himself
to produce one yet larger, as a result of which we have
the splendid Blaeu globe of 1622.

A pair of this issue of the year 1613 may be found in the
Biblioteca Barbarini of Rome, and another pair in the Biblioteca
Civico of Treviso. An example of the celestial globe
may be found in the Museo di Strumenti Antichi di Astronomia
e di Fisica of Florence.

In the year 1615 we find that Josef de Rossi of Milan
undertook, without giving proper credit, the publication of
the Hondius globes of the year 1601.12 In size there is agreement,
but certain changes in dates are to be noted, as in the
address to the reader, wherein we find 1615 instead of 1601,
but in other respects there has been a literal transcription.
In the celestial globe of 1601 we find the following reference
to the recorded position of the fixed stars, &#8220;Accomodata ad
annum 1600, editus vero 1601,&#8221; whereas in the Rossi copy
we find &#8220;accomodatae ad annum 1614 editus vero 1615.&#8221;14
The dedication of this terrestrial globe of 1615 reads: &#8220;Illmo
viro optimaraq&#772; artium amatori et Fautori D. Paulo Mellino
Romano. Josephus de Rubeis Mediolanensis devoti animi
monumentum dat dicatque.&#8221; &#8220;To the Most Illustrious, the
Lover and Promoter of the best arts D. Paulus Mellinus of
Rome, Joseph de Rossi of Milan gives and dedicates this
token of devoted friendship.&#8221; A copy of the terrestrial globe
of 1615 may be found in the private library of the Italian
artist, Lessi, of Florence, and a copy of the celestial globe
belongs to Collegio Romano of Rome.

The Hispanic Society of America possesses a terrestrial
globe signed Jodocus Hondius and dated 1618 (Fig. 91).
Jodocus the elder died in the year 1611, and while the map
of this globe may be a reprint of one which he had engraved,
it should be noted that it does not agree in all of its details
with any other known globe of his, and may therefore be the
work of the son. The sphere of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; has a diameter
of 20 cm. and is supported on a base of wood which includes
a horizon circle, having pasted on its surface the usual representations
of zodiacal signs, the calendar, and the names of
the principal winds or directions. This horizon circle rests
upon four small turned legs joined at the bottom by cross
bars, covering which bars is a circular turned disc 22 cm. in
diameter, from the center of which rises a short post.
Through a slot in this post passes a graduated meridian
circle within which the globe ball revolves.

Fig. 91. Terrestrial Globe of Jodocus Hondius, 1618.

The map is slightly water-stained, but the American portion
is particularly well preserved. A crack in the sphere
along the meridian of 150 degrees east extends from pole to
pole, and is rather a disfigurement than a serious injury to
any part of the surface. The map is a remarkably fine example
of the Dutch map engraver&#8217;s art. The lettering and the
continental outlines were remarkably well cut in the copper
plate used in the printing, and in many places the luster
of the ink is still preserved. In the northern part of North
America is the brief and interesting dedication &#8220;Clarissimis
15Consultissimique Nauticae Belgicaeque Federatarum Inferioris
Germaniae Regionum Praefectis D. D. Jodocus Hondius.&#8221;
&#8220;To the most illustrious and most prudent prefects
and seamen of Belgium and of the region of lower Germany,
Jodocus Hondius gives and dedicates (this globe).&#8221;
In the &#8220;Terra Australis incognita&#8221; is the address to
the reader which is practically identical with that to be
found on the Hondius terrestrial globe of 1601, omitting,
however, the word &#8220;Vale&#8221; and changing the date to &#8220;1618.&#8221;
Near the entrance to Hudson&#8217;s Bay is a legend reading &#8220;Huc
retrocesserunt Amstelodamensis anno 1612.&#8221;

From this bay an arm extends to the southwest which is
referred to as &#8220;The bay where Hudson did winter,&#8221; and an
arm extends to the southeast, which is referred to as &#8220;The
Bay of Gosneres.&#8221; A few other brief legends are given, referring
to an event or to events supposed to have taken place
in the locality in which they are placed. Small but artistically
engraved ships sail the Atlantic and the Pacific, and
here and there a marine animal is represented. Loxodromic
lines are made a conspicuous feature, having their crossing
centers at longitudes 0, 90, 180, and 270 on the equator,
likewise on the prime meridian at latitude 35 degrees both
north and south, as well as at the same latitudes on the
opposite side of the sphere, where the prime meridian becomes
the meridian of 180 degrees. In addition to this example
belonging to The Hispanic Society&#8217;s collection, one may
be found in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum of N&uuml;rnberg.13

Not until the year 1640 do we find the name Hondius
again appearing on a dated globe. Attention has been called
to the fact that Henricus, the son of Jodocus, continued,
with more or less diligence, the work of map engraving and
map printing, which the latter had carried on so successfully
in Amsterdam until the time of his death. We are told
that a partnership in the business, about the year 1639, was
formed by Henricus Hondius with Johan Janssonius, his16
brother-in-law, and that this business, after the year 1644,
passed entirely into the hands of the latter. It was in the
year 1640 that the firm referred to undertook the reissue of
the Hondius globes of earlier date. These had a diameter of
about 52 cm. The gore maps, consisting of twelve parts,
were made to extend to within twenty degrees of each pole,
the polar space being covered with the usual polar cap.

The address to the reader, to be found on the terrestrial
globe of the year 1613, is repeated on this of 1640,14 but the
dedication differs somewhat in the two, reading, on those
of the 1640 issue, &#8220;Illustrissimis, Nobilissimis, Amplissimis
et Prudentissimis Foederatarum Inferioris Germaniae provinciarum
Ordinibus ac Patribus Patriae Dominis suis clementissimis
dedicabat Henricus Hondius. Henricus Hondius
excudebat An. 1640.&#8221; &#8220;To the Most Illustrious, Most
Noble, Most Exalted and Prudent Lords of the United
Netherlands, the Fathers of their Country, his Most Clement
Master, Henricus Hondius dedicates (this globe). Constructed
by Henricus Hondius in the year 1640.&#8221; There have
been added a number of interesting legends, such as the following:
&#8220;Inter S. Laurentii et los Romeros insulas vehemens
admodum est versus ortum et occasum fluxus et refluxus
maris.&#8221; &#8220;Between the islands of St. Lawrence and Los
Romeros there is an exceedingly strong ebb and flow of the
sea eastward and westward&#8221;; &#8220;Psitacorum regio sic a Lusitanis
appellata ob eorum avium ibidem magnitudinem.&#8221;
&#8220;The region of the parrots, and this is so called by the Portuguese
because of the great number of these birds found
here&#8221;;15 &#8220;Promontorium terrae australis distans 450 leucas
a capite Bonae Spei et 600 a S. Augustini.&#8221; &#8220;This promontory
of the southern land is distant 450 leagues from the
Cape of Good Hope, and 600 from Cape St. Augustine&#8221;;
&#8220;Accolae Freti Magellanici septentrionem versus procerae,
meridiem vero versus exiquae magnitidinis reperiuntur.&#8221;
&#8220;The inhabitants of the Strait of Magellan toward the
north are of large size, but toward the south they are of17
small stature&#8221;; &#8220;Lybia inferior quae hodie Saara appellatur
quae vox idem quod desertum significat.&#8221; &#8220;Lower Lybia
is called today Sahara, which word means desert.&#8221; In the
Hudson Bay region we find, &#8220;In sinu Maris Hudsons Bay
vulgo dictus ubi M. Hudson hybernavit, ibidem maris
aestus non ultra duos pedes accrescebat, quod et observabit
D. Thomas Jacobus a. 1631 in sinu &#8216;James his Bay&#8217; dicto
et ubi mensuram duorum pedum non excedebat maris
tumor.&#8221; &#8220;In the bend of the sea called Hudson&#8217;s Bay, where
Hudson passed the winter, the tide of the sea did not rise
more than two feet, which also was observed by Thomas
James in the year 163116 in the Bay called James his Bay
where the rise of the sea likewise did not exceed two feet.&#8221;
Near the last-quoted legend we find, &#8220;Thomas Button hibernans
in portu Nelson ad altitudinem grad. 57 observavit
singulis ex horis aestum maris accrescere 15 pedes aut ultra,
qui flante Zephiro solito magis instar plenilunii intumescebat.
Sequenti aestate animadvertit quoque ad altitudinem
grad. 60 similes aestus maris qui nunc orientem versus nunc
occidentem vergebant.&#8221; &#8220;Thomas Button,17 who passed the
winter in Port Nelson, at the high latitude of 57 degrees,
observed hour by hour the tide of the sea to rise 15 feet or
more, which tide, with the accustomed wind blowing,
swelled very like a (spring) tide. Next summer he noticed
at a latitude of 60 degrees similar ocean tides which now
had an eastward flow and now a westward.&#8221; A legend has
been added relating to the magnetic poles and to the difficulty
of locating the same, reading &#8220;Duos in hoc loco
Gerardus Mercator et alii eundem secuti posuerunt Polos
magnetis, unum respectu insularum capitis viridis, alterum
respectu insulae Corvi et Floridis: cum vero de his nihil certi
sit, et quotidiana experientia nos aliter doceat de deviatione
acus nauticae ambos omissimus.&#8221; &#8220;Gerard Mercator and
others following him have placed two magnetic poles in this
locality, one according to the direction indicated (by the
compass needle) at the Cape Verde Islands, the other according18
to the direction indicated at the Islands of Corvus
and Flores: but as nothing is known for a certainty concerning
these, and a daily experience teaches us otherwise
concerning the variation of the magnetic needle, we have
omitted both poles.&#8221;18

The globes of this edition were supplied with the usual
brass meridian circles, wooden horizon circles, on the surface
of which was pasted the printed representation of the
zodiacal signs, the names of the months, and of the principal
winds or directions.

The celestial globe follows, in its records, more closely
than does the terrestrial, the issue of 1613. The title legend,
the reference to Tycho Brahe, and the reference to the star
which appeared in the year 1572 in the constellation Cassiopeia,
all agree with those in the earlier edition, as do, in
the main, the representations of the figures of the several
Ptolemaic constellations and those added in the southern
hemisphere. The dedication reads, &#8220;Illustrissimis Nobilissimis
Amplissimis Clarissimisque D. D. Dominis Ordinibus
Provinciarum Foederis Belgici Dominis suis Clementissimis
in assiduae gratitudinis memoriam dat, dicat dedicatque
Illustriss. Amplit. Vest. devotus Henricus Hondius.&#8221; &#8220;To
the Most Illustrious, Most Noble, Most Exalted, Most Renowned
Lords of the United Provinces of Belgium, his
Most Clement Masters, as a memorial of constant gratitude,
gives and dedicates to Your Illustrious Highnesses (this
globe). Henricus Hondius.&#8221;

A copy of each of these globes of 1640 may be found in
the library of the Seminario Vescovile of Portogruaro, a
copy of each in the Biblioteca Quiriniana of Brescia, and
one of each, though undated, in the Museo Civico of
Vicenza.

If the Van Langren family and the Hondius family
brought renown to their country through the excellence of
their work in the field of cartography, so likewise did the
Blaeu family, father and sons. Perhaps to Willem Jansz.
19Blaeu (Fig. 92) and his son, John, belongs first place in
the long line of distinguished map and globe makers of the
Netherlands.19

Fig. 92. Portrait of Willem Jansz. Blaeu.

A record which finds general acceptance tells us that
Willem Blaeu was born in the village of Alkmaar in the
year 1571.20 Of his childhood years very little is known.
It was some time in his early boyhood that he went to
Amsterdam, where he found employment, it appears, at
first in the house of a Holland merchant, and later as a
joiner&#8217;s apprentice. We can be certain neither of the time
when he decided to leave Amsterdam, nor of the exact circumstances
which induced him to visit the island of Hveen,
then belonging to Denmark, an event of much significance
in his life. We, however, cannot be far wrong in asserting
the promptings for this visit to have been his early liking
for mathematical, geographical, and astronomical studies.
It was here that he first came into intimate relations with
Tycho Brahe, the famous Danish astronomer, who, in the
year 1576, through princely favor, came into possession of
this island, and, as before noted, had erected here his remarkably
well-appointed astronomical observatory, which he
called Uranienburg.21 For nearly a quarter of a century this
was one of the most famous centers in all Europe for the
study of astronomical science and of its practical application.
Blaeu, however, was not the first of the young Netherlanders
to find the way to Uranienburg to receive instruction
from the great master.22 Of his sojourn on the island we
have but little direct information. It appears certain that
he passed at least two years with Tycho, engaged the while
in study and in the construction of mathematical and astronomical
instruments. That the relations between the two
distinguished scientists continued to be of the most friendly
character after Blaeu returned to Amsterdam is very certain.
Not a few of those who in later years praised Blaeu&#8217;s scientific
attainments refer to him as &#8220;the pupil and longtime
friend of Brahe,&#8221; and Blaeu himself, in certain legends20
appearing on his globes and maps, refers to him as his
teacher. It cannot be doubted that Blaeu owed to his abode
on the Island of Hveen the real foundation of his scientific
knowledge, both in the field of geography and astronomy,
as well as his knowledge of the construction and the skilful
use of mathematical instruments. We have reason for believing
that a number of the instruments which served the
great astronomer in his investigations23 were the work of
Blaeu, and it is an interesting fact, as we know, that
Brahe&#8217;s observations, here made, formed the basis for Kepler&#8217;s
calculations, leading him to the discovery of the laws
which immortalized his name.24

It was perhaps late in the year 1596 or early in the year
1597 that Blaeu returned to Amsterdam, where he soon
established himself as a maker of mathematical instruments,
of maps and of globes, and as an engraver and printer.
There is good reason for thinking that from the first he
prospered in his undertakings, and, from incidental references
to his activities, it may be inferred that it was not
long after 1600 he was in his own fully equipped house.
From his presses numerous works were issued, the many
examples of which, still adorning the shelves of most prominent
libraries, are a monument to his great abilities.

On his &#8216;Paescarte,&#8217; one of his earliest publications,25 and
usually referred to the year 1606, we read that it was
&#8220;Ghedruckt t&#8217; Amsterdam bij Willem Janssoon op&#8217;t Waeter
inde Sonnewijser,&#8221; a location often referred to in certain
later publications as &#8220;op&#8217; t water In de vergulde Sonnewyser,&#8221;
reference here being to the gilded sundial which, as
a business sign, adorned the gable of his establishment. It
appears that in this originally selected locality his work was
carried on until the year 1637, when his entire plant was
moved into more commodious quarters in the Blumengracht,
one year only before his death. The sons, John and
Cornelius, succeeded to the business, and to the former especially
belongs the credit of issuing the most sumptuous atlas21
in that period of remarkable map making.26 In the year 1672
practically the entire establishment was destroyed by fire.

Willem Blaeu&#8217;s training admirably fitted him to serve
his country in matters pertaining to its maritime interests,
and its calls as well as its rewards for service were not
infrequent. As proof of the confidence that his contemporaries
had in his knowledge of geography and navigation, the
Estates General of Amsterdam, January 3, 1633, by resolution,
appointed him Map Maker of the Republic, an honorable
position held by him until his death, then being successively
passed on to his son and to his grandson.27

We are told that Tycho had given to Blaeu a copy of his
astronomical observations before their publication, that this
copy was carried to Amsterdam, and that after a careful
study of the records contained therein the latter began the
practice of globe making.28 The implication contained in
this reference is that his first work as a globe maker was
the preparation of material for a celestial globe, but no such
globe of his, bearing date earlier than 1602, is known. His
first dated work appears to have been a terrestrial globe of
the year 1599. In many of its features it gives evidence that
Mercator was the master followed, notably in the representation
of the loxodromic lines which radiate from the
numerous wind or compass roses, or from centers regularly
placed on the surface of the globe.

This first issue has a diameter of 34 cm., which is less
than that of Mercator&#8217;s globe of the year 1541, but greater
than that of the Van Langren globe of the year 1585.29 The
gores, twelve in number, were cut seven degrees from the
poles, the polar space being covered with a circular disc.
Blaeu, as many other globe makers of his period, found that
by thus dividing the engraved globe map a more nearly perfect
covering for the sphere could be obtained. Meridians and
parallels are drawn at intervals of ten degrees, the prime
meridian passing through the island of Santa Maria in the
Azores group. In a conspicuously placed cartouch he presents22
his address to the reader. &#8220;Spectatori meo S. Hanc
terrae marisque faciem qui aspicis sic inspice ne dispicias:
multa hic mutata, (sed nihil temere) quae, nisi attendas,
facile fugiant. Ratio constructionis in multis nova, sed
proba. Gibbum plano, planum globo commutavimus: duplicato
labori: sed certiori: idque ut ventorum spirae justis per
orbem trrarum gyris discurrerent: hinc factum ut in omnibus
terrae oris praeter parallelorum et meridianorum etiam
plagae ratio nobis fuerit habenda. Quae quidem omnia attento
spectatori facile apparebunt. Vale et fruere. Guilielmus
Jansonius Alcmariensis auctor et sculptor. 1599.&#8221;
&#8220;Greeting to my observer. This representation of the earth
and sea, which thou beholdest, be pleased to take note of in
this manner. Many things here have been changed, but
nothing without reason, and unless thou art attentive these
things might easily escape thee. The method of construction
is in many points new, but correct. We have changed that
which is relief into the flat, and the flat into the globular,
a double labor but more nearly correct, and we did this
that the directions of the winds throughout the world might
be given their proper (loxodromic) spirals: and we have
made a representation of the coast lines of all shores of the
earth, besides a representation of the parallels and meridians.
All this will be seen by the attentive observer. Farewell,
and may you be happy. William Jansz. Alcmar,
author and sculptor. 1599.&#8221; Fiorini is of the opinion the
expression &#8220;multa hic mutata&#8221; in the above quoted inscription
indicates that the copies in which it is found are reprints
of an earlier edition, and that it has been inserted for
the purpose of keeping the globe on sale. Is not the reference
rather to this simple fact that Blaeu borrowed much
of his geographical information from others, as he admits,
including Mercator and Van Langren, and that he had
merely altered the same to the end of bringing his records
to date? The dedication reads &#8220;Noblissimis, Amplissimis,
Clarissimis, D. D. Dominis Ordinibus Foederatarum Inferioris23
Germaniae Provinciarum dignissimis fidis Patriae
Patribus hoc terrae marisque Theatrum L. M. Q. Dat,
Dicat, Dedicat Cliens Vester subjectis. Guilielmus Jansonius
Alcmarianus.&#8221; &#8220;To the Most Noble, Most Distinguished,
Most Illustrious, Lords of the United Provinces
of Lower Germany, Fathers of their Country this representation
of the land and the sea gives, grants, and delivers
your humble client Willem Jansz. Alcmar.&#8221; It will be noted
that the family name Blaeu was not employed in the signature,
but instead Alcmar, the name of his native place. He
apparently did not consider it essential always to employ
the same name. Sometimes he gave this as Guilielmus Jansonius
Blaeu, Guil. Jansz. Blaeu, Guiljelmus Blaeuw;
sometimes he gave it as Guilielmus Janssonius Alcmarianus,
or Guil. Jansz. Alcmar; sometimes as Guiljelmus
Caesius or J. G. Caesius, in which he had classicized his
name Blaeu; sometimes the name is coupled with that of
the son as Guil. et Johan Blaeu. The legends on this globe
are numerous which tell of great discoveries and explorations,
of which the principal ones are here quoted from
Baudet&#8217;s readings from the Leiden copy. Near the north
pole we find &#8220;Hic tandem passi graviora Batavi, proxima
tempestate diversum iam iter ingressi, nostrum altius mundi
verticem versus progressi, ignotas quaerere terras, et si qua
proprior ad Chinam aditus aggressi sunt. Mirum quid invenerint!
immane quid evenerit! Sic, macte Proles Neptunia
novisque honoribus hanc gentem nostram cumula,
male coepisti, si hic sistas. Durum hoc, sed perdura, nec
cede malis sed contra audentior ito. Fata viam expedient.&#8221;
&#8220;As far as this, after suffering great hardships, the Dutch,
in recent times have progressed toward the top of the world,
seeking unknown lands, and if there is any shorter way to
China. Wonderful are their discoveries! Strange things have
happened! Go on, O blessed progeny of Neptune, and add
new honors to our race. You have begun ill if you stop here.
It is a hard task, but endure. Do not yield to misfortune, but24
on the contrary be more daring. Fate will clear the way.&#8221;

In the same locality &#8220;Immortale nomen &amp; gloriam incomparabilem
vobis, Columbe et Americe comparastis, Qui
primi has terras (alteram orbis partem) tot iam secula
latentes adire, detegere, lustrare et utinam perlustrare voluistis:
Fructs vero maximos multis perperistis.&#8221; &#8220;Ye have
gained an immortal name, and incomparable glory for yourselves,
Columbus and Americus, who were the first to approach
these lands to discover and disclose them (the other
part of the world) unknown for so many centuries, and I
would that you had desired to explore them. You have
brought forth much fruit for the many.&#8221; Another reads,
&#8220;Magnam porro gloriae partem Ferdinande Magellane,
iure tibi vendicas: cui ... vastae regionis Australem terminum
quaerere eamq. freto cognimini nobis perviam facere
lubuit &amp; licuit.&#8221; &#8220;A large share of the glory thou doest
rightly claim, O Ferdinand Magellan, to whom it was
pleasing and to whom it was allowed to seek the southern
bounds of a vast region, and to open the Strait for us that
bears thy name&#8221;; also a legend referring to the Cortereals,
&#8220;Utinam vero par eventus Casparo Cortereali contigisset,
qui iam ante maiori conatu quam successu transitum a
Borea attentaverat: et quoties Britannis idem fervide molientibus
et aeris iniutiis gradum revocare coactis.&#8221; &#8220;I wish
that like success had come to Gaspar Cortereal, who before,
with greater effort than achievement attempted to find a
passage by way of the north. Likewise to the British (I
wish success) strenuously attempting the same but forced
to retreat by reason of adverse weather.&#8221;

As in the issue of his sheet maps, Blaeu was not always
careful to add an exact date of preparation, in the majority
of instances, indeed, omitting the date altogether, so also
in the issue of his globes he frequently omitted dates or
gave one which we know to have been later than was that
of the original issue. His geographical records serve us,
however, as fairly accurate guides in the determination of25
these dates, and what was so frequently true of the globes
he constructed in the last years of his life was true of this
his first. We have, for example, copies of this bearing date
1599, which contains geographical records of the year 1616,
indicating therefore a later reprint with a few alterations.

It was not until the year 1603 that he undertook the
preparation of a celestial globe to serve as a companion of
his first terrestrial. This he dedicated, &#8220;Illustrisso Principi
ac Domi&#333;auritio, Principi Auraico Comiti de Naussau
etc., Marchioni Veriae et Flissingae etc., Domino suo Clementissimo,
Hos astriferum, stellarum arte coelo deductarum,
coelum Gratus M.O.D.D.C.Q. Guilielmus Jansonius
Alcmarianus.&#8221; &#8220;To the Illustrious Prince and Lord D.
Maurice, Prince of Orange, Count of Nassau, etc., Marquis
of Veria and Flissingen, etc., his Most Benign Lord, this
globe of the stars brought down from heaven by art is
gratefully dedicated by its maker with dutiful mind.
Willem Jansz. Alcmar.&#8221; In his title legend he makes particular
reference to his teacher Tycho, which legend reads:
&#8220;Sphaera stellifera. In qua ut speculo quondam firmamenti
Universaum Syder&#363; ornatum ac stellarum ordinem summa,
qua fieri potuit, industria a Guilielmo Jansonio, magni
Tychonis quondam discipulo, accuratissime disposititum:
earumque numerum multo quam hactenus, auctiorem ex
observationibus recens. a Nob. viro D. Tychone Brahe,
astronomo inc&#333;parabili, habitis, depromta anno 1600, et
quo deinceps seculo, accommodata intueri liceat.&#8221; &#8220;Celestial
sphere. Herein as in a mirror all the stars of the firmament
are depicted, and in proper order with the greatest possible
industry and accuracy by Willem Janson the former pupil
of the great Tycho: their number much increased from recent
observations made by the noble D. Tycho Brahe, that
incomparable astronomer, taken from his observations made
in the year 1600, and made with an accommodation for
the coming century.&#8221; Near this cartouch is a portrait of the
great astronomer with his favorite motto, &#8220;Non haberi, sed26
esse.&#8221; Near the south pole we find a reference to recent
astronomical discoveries in the following words: &#8220;Habetis
hic, Astronomum studiosi, trecentas et plures antarctici
mundi vertici viciniores stellas, ex observationibus secundum
jam a Frederico Houtmanno, majori studio et accommodatioribus
instrumentis, ad stellas a Tychone positas factis, depromptas:
auctiori numero et accuratiori dispositione vestro
commodo et delectationi depictas A. 1603.&#8221; &#8220;Thou hast
here, O student of astronomy, more than three hundred
stars, that are nearest the pole of the antarctic world, from
the observations made by Frederick Houtmann with further
study and with more suitable instruments, along with
the stars that were located by Tycho: this increased number
and this more accurate location having been set down
for your use and delight in the year 1603.&#8221; He adds here
and there a brief legend in which he directs attention to
recently discovered stars.

The purchase of a pair of these globes, that of 1599 and
of 1603, was reported in the year 1885 by Dr. Baumg&auml;rtner,31
who refers to them as having a diameter of 34 cm.,
as being well mounted and artistically colored. On the first,
he notes, are represented sea monsters swimming in the
oceans, and the natives of many of the little known regions
appear in picture, as, for example, in the region of Patagonia,
near which appears the legend, &#8220;Patagonae regio ubi
incolae sunt gigantes.&#8221; &#8220;The region of Patagonia where
giants live.&#8221; Greenland is laid down as a small island, as
is also Corea. The region of Bering Sea shows clearly how
inexact was the knowledge of the North Pacific in his day,
and the same inexact geographic knowledge of the southernmost
region of South America and of Australia is strikingly
recorded. There are slight differences apparently existing
between Dr. Baumg&auml;rtner&#8217;s globes and certain other known
copies of the same date, but differences which are of no
special significance.

A pair of these globes was announced in the sales catalogue,27
&#8220;Geographie cartographie &amp; voyage, 1891,&#8221; of Frederik
Muller of Amsterdam. A geographical record on the
terrestrial globe clearly indicates that it was not issued,
however, until after 1616, although dated 1599, since it
contains a reference to the Van Schouten voyage of 1615-1617.
It was on this voyage, says Van Schouten in his
&#8216;Journal,&#8217; that he gave the name &#8220;Staten Lant&#8221; to that
region on the left as one enters the Lemaire Strait, and the
name &#8220;Isle of Barnevelt&#8221; to the island discovered in this
strait.32 Both of these names appear on this globe. It has
in addition an interesting legend which might be taken to
suggest that the globe was not constructed until the year
1682, although the gores, save for this legend, may have
been printed much earlier. This legend reads, &#8220;&#8217;t Amsteldam
by Joannes van Ceulen, Joanniszoon op de hoek van
de Mol-steegh, in de Nieuwen Atlas, werd gedruckt en op
nieu uytgegeven met Praevilegie ... alle de Globes en
Spaeren by den Heer Joan Blaeu Zal. nagelaten. Ao. 1682.&#8221;
The celestial globe seems to agree with other known copies.

Two copies of the terrestrial globe of 1599 and two of
the celestial of 1603 may be found in the Germanisches
Nationalmuseum of N&uuml;rnberg. A pair may be found in the
Biblioteca Angelica of Rome and a pair, reported to be in
good condition, belongs to the Biblioteca Comunale of
Fano. Adam K&auml;stner reports, in his &#8216;Geschichte der Mathematik,&#8217;
the purchase of a pair of this first edition of Blaeu&#8217;s
globes.33 According to a catalogue entry of objects belonging
to the University of Leiden in the year 1716 there is
reference to two pairs of Blaeu&#8217;s globes. Only one pair of
these, however, seems now to be known, which pair a few
years since was removed to the Astronomical Observatory.34

In the year 1602 Blaeu issued a terrestrial and a celestial
globe, each having a diameter of 23 cm. In a legend on his
terrestrial globe he refers to it as an improvement, doubtless
meaning that he had undertaken to bring its geographical
records to date. This globe he dedicates as follows:28
&#8220;Noblisis Illustris Hollandiae Zelandiae ac Westphrisiae
ordinibus, P.P.P. Clementissis hanc terrae marisque aphaerum
summa diligentia accuratissime fabricatam: debiti
honoris gratique animi testimonium L.M.D.D.D. Amstelodami.
Guilielmus Jansonius Blaeu. anno 1602.&#8221; &#8220;To the
Most Noble, Most Illustrious Princes of Holland, Zeeland
and West Friesland, Most Benign Rulers. This sphere of
the earth and sea, accurately constructed with the utmost
care is dedicated by Willem Jansz. Blaeu of Amsterdam as
a testimony of honor due and of a grateful mind. In the year
1602.&#8221; Over this legend have been placed the coats of arms
of the three provinces designated and near it a legend reading,
&#8220;En denuo studiose Geographiae, terrestrem contractioriforma
globum, multo, quam ante hac unquam, emendatius
et auctius confectum: a ventorum spiris navigantium
comodo, exquisitius adornatum: nec non navigationis curriculo,
ab Oliverio van Noort Batavo in orbem peracto, notatum.
Auctor Guilielmo Iansonio Blaeu.&#8221; &#8220;Here again, O
student of geography, thou hast a terrestrial globe in smaller
size, much smaller than ever before, and more accurately
and completely furnished, having the spiral directions of
the winds (the loxodromes) represented for the use of navigators.
These have been carefully drawn, and there is also
indicated the course of circumnavigation of the Dutchman
Oliver van der Noort.35 Willem Jansz. Blaeu author.&#8221; Van
der Noort, to whom reference is made in this legend, had
started out in the year 1598, hence his expedition was a
recent event and was therefore thought worthy of reference.
He sailed through the Strait of Magellan, reached the Indies
of the East, and with four of his original ships returned to
Holland in the year 1601. Blaeu, as he states, marked on
his globe the course of this expedition. The celestial globe
constructed as a companion of the former has a similar dedication
reading, &#8220;Nobilisis Illustis Hollandiae Zelandiae
Westphrisiae Ordinibus D. D. suis Clementisis hunc astriferum
inerrantium stellarum globum, summa cura et industria29
adornatum debiti ossequii et gratitudinis ... D. D.
D. Guilielmus Jansonius Blaeu.&#8221; &#8220;To the Most Noble, and
Illustrious Princes of Holland, Zeeland, and West Friesland,
Most Benign Rulers: this celestial globe of the fixed
stars, prepared with the greatest care and industry is dedicated
as a gift of obedience due and of gratitude. William
Jansz. Blaeu.&#8221; A legend somewhat descriptive in character
near the former reads, &#8220;Habes hic Astrophile stellarum
inerantium ex certisis D. Ticho Brahe (mei quondam praeceptoris)
observationibus numero et dispositione prae aliis
an&#772;o 1600 accomodatarum sphaeram accuratissime expolitam
et Australibus asterismis quod novum a Federico Houtmano
observatis exornatam. Auctor Guilielmo Janso Blaeu.&#8221;
&#8220;Thou hast here, O lover of the stars, a globe of the fixed
stars from the most accurate observations of D. Tycho
Brahe (my onetime preceptor) in their number and disposition,
besides other observations accommodated to the year
1600, finished and furnished with (a representation) of the
southern stars which have of late been discovered by Frederick
Houtmann. Willem Jansz. Blaeu author.&#8221; Stars varying
in magnitude from the first to the sixth, receive each an
appropriate representation or sign, and there is a separate
distinguishing mark for the nebulae. To each of the constellations
is given its Latin name. In addition to the forty-eight
constellations of Ptolemy he gives the two sometimes
referred to by the ancients, &#8220;Bernice&#8217;s Hair&#8221; and &#8220;Antinous,&#8221;
adding, with names, more than ten constellations in
the southern sky. A legend in the constellation &#8220;Cepheus&#8221;
tells us, with reference to one of its stars, &#8220;Haec stupendae
magnitudinis stella insolito fulgore anno 1572 in Cassiopeia
sede amicuit.&#8221; &#8220;This star of great size and unwonted brilliancy
appeared in the Chair of Cassiopeia.&#8221; In the constellation
&#8220;Cygnus&#8221; is a legend reading &#8220;Novam illam stellam
quae anno 1600 primum in pectore Cygni apparuit (atque
etiam nunc immota parte) ex diligenti nostra ad eandem
Lyrae lucidae observatione Longitudo 16&deg; 15&acute;, latitudo30
55&deg; 30&acute; labore comperimus.&#8221; &#8220;The new star which in the
year 1600 first appeared in the breast of the Swan and to the
present has not altogether disappeared, this we have located,
by diligent search in Lyra long. 16&deg; 15&acute; and lat. 55&deg; 30&acute;.&#8221;

By reason of the fact that so few copies of this issue are
known to exist, it has been thought that for some reason
Blaeu issued a very limited number. We know, however,
that his terrestrial globes were highly valued and were much
in demand, because of the care with which they had been
prepared, because of the efforts to give information concerning
the latest discoveries, and because of his representation
of the loxodromic lines which made them of special
value to navigators; that his celestial globes found favor by
reason of the fact that he was known to be a pupil of Tycho
Brahe, and that he himself was known to be a mathematician
and astronomer of distinction. To the following known
examples of the 1602 issue brief reference may be made.
In the Accademia dei Concordi of Rovigo, Italy, there may
be found a fine pair. The Stadtbibliothek of N&uuml;rnberg
possesses a fine pair, reported by the librarian to be in excellent
condition, and two copies of the celestial globe may be
found in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum of the same
city. A copy of the terrestrial globe is to be found in the collection
of the K&ouml;nigliches Museum of Cassel, and one in
the town of R&uuml;dingen near Schaffhausen.

The Hispanic Society of America possesses, in its rich
collection of globes, a fine example of Blaeu&#8217;s terrestrial of
the year 1606 (Fig. 93). It has a diameter of 13.5 cm., is
mounted on a substantial wooden base, has a graduated
meridian circle, half of which, however, is missing, a
wooden horizon circle, on the upper surface of which is
pasted an engraved slip of paper with the usual graduation,
the calendar, and the names of the zodiacal signs. A legend
in the great austral land which is called &#8220;Magallanica,&#8221; contains
the date and refers to its dedication to Blaeu&#8217;s learned
friend of Edam, Cornelius Petrius. This legend reads
31&#8220;Omnium virtut&#363; genere ornatissimo viro Domino Cornelio
Petreio ecclesiastae apud Edamenses vigilantiss. et mathematico
eximio suo singulari hanc orbis sphaerae a se hoc
modo delineatae L. M. Q. D. D. Guilielmus Blaeu. Anno
D. 1606.&#8221; &#8220;To Dom. Cornelius Petrius, a man adorned with
all virtue, a most vigilant ecclesiastic among the people of
Edam and a mathematician of singular renown, Willem
Blaeu dedicates this terrestrial globe now completed by him
in the year 1606.&#8221; In the northern part of North America is
the title legend reading &#8220;Nova et accurata terrae marisque
sphaera denuo recognita et correcta a Guilielmo Blaeu.&#8221;
&#8220;A new and accurate sphere of the earth and sea newly revised
and corrected by Willem Blaeu.&#8221; The globe ball is of
hollow metal thinly covered with a preparation of plaster
on which have been pasted the twelve engraved gores extending
from pole to pole. As in the case of the Muller
copy of the issue of 1599 this one, though dated 1606, contains
a record of the discoveries of the Van Schouten expedition,
that is, the names &#8220;Staten Lant,&#8221; &#8220;I. Barnevelt,&#8221;
and &#8220;Fr. le Maire,&#8221; discoveries made in the year 1616, as
before mentioned.36 The magnitude of the austral land is
made to equal or to exceed that of the entire Old World,
the most northern extension of which, in the East Indian
region, bears the name &#8220;Nova Guinea.&#8221;37 Its geographical
information in general agrees with that so carefully recorded
on the Blaeu maps. In the western and southern sections of
North America the source of information has been largely
Spanish, in the eastern the source has been French and English,
and in the northeast almost entirely English. In the
north Atlantic we still find &#8220;Brazil,&#8221; &#8220;Maides,&#8221; and
&#8220;Frisland,&#8221; the mythical islands of the Zeno Brothers, and
north of Europe a record of the attempts of the Netherlanders
to reach &#8220;Nowaja Semlja.&#8221; For so small a globe the
detailed geographical information given is very remarkable.

In addition to this example the British Museum kindly
sends the information that in its collection there is a copy32
of Blaeu&#8217;s terrestrial globe of the year 1606, agreeing in its
dimensions with the copy in the collection of The Hispanic
Society of America, also of a celestial globe of the same date
which appears to be a unique copy.

The Hispanic Society of America also possesses a terrestrial
and a celestial globe, the work of Blaeu, globes clearly
issued as companion pieces (Fig. 94), which appear to
be the only copies known, the latter dated 1616, the
former undated.38 The spheres have each a diameter of about
10 cm., a substantial and artistic mounting of brass, including
meridian and horizon circles, four twisted support
columns, and a circular base plate. Though small in size,
probably the smallest constructed by Blaeu, in their geographical
and astronomical details they are remarkably full.

Fig. 94. Terrestrial and Celestial Globes of Willem Jansz. Blaeu, 1616.

The terrestrial globe, in an artistic cartouch near the south
pole, is referred to as &#8220;Nova Orbis Terrarum Descriptio
Auctor Guilielmo Blaeu.&#8221; &#8220;A new description of the world
by Willem Blaeu author.&#8221; Unlike that of the year 1606,
noted above, it contains no reference to the expedition of
Van Schouten and Le Maire, and records only the Strait of
Magellan at the southern extremity of South America.
Continental contours, even that of &#8220;Magallanica&#8221; and of
the New World, agree in practically all details with his
earlier globes and general world maps. He has retained certain
geographical names which appear more or less conspicuously
on some of the earlier maps, as &#8220;Estotiland&#8221;
north of Labrador, &#8220;Frisland&#8221; and &#8220;Island&#8221; in the north
Atlantic and &#8220;Norembega&#8221; applied to the coast of Maine.
The north Pacific is entirely too narrow and the island of
&#8220;Japan&#8221; is located not far from the west coast of North
America. Bering Strait is well represented but is unnamed.
The map is not well preserved, the chief injury to it being
in the western part of North America and in the central and
eastern Pacific.

The celestial globe, which is the companion of the
former, has a similar brass mounting. It is remarkably well
33preserved and all inscriptions on the surface of the ball are
easily legible. It is made to revolve about the axis of the
ecliptic. The figures representing the several constellations
have been artistically engraved, and stars up to the sixth
magnitude have appropriate and distinct representation.
A legend near the south pole reads &#8220;Sphaera stellata in qua
ceu speculo Stellae fixae ex accuratis Nobilis viri D.
Tychonis Brahe observationibus ad annum 1600 accommodatae
conspicuae sito ponuntur.&#8221; &#8220;The starry sphere in
which as in a mirror the fixed stars are placed by the accurate
observations of the Noble D. Tycho Brahe, accommodated
to the year 1600.&#8221;

Blaeu&#8217;s earliest globes, as has been noted, were of small
dimensions. It must have been shortly after the year 1616
that he decided to undertake the construction of those of
much greater size, to the end of making his work the more
serviceable; but to this he may have been led in part, as
before noted, by the success of the large globes of Hondius
of the year 1613.39 Unfortunately it is not easy to determine
the exact date of the several issues of his work appearing in
the last twenty years of his life. In general, the date of the
construction of the globes of these years is altogether wanting.
The dedications in the several reprints or editions vary,
as do many of the inscriptions, while the large size of the
globes remains practically the same. One cannot feel certain
that a date, apparently given as the year of construction,
is accurate, since it is very evident in the several
reprints care was not always given to this detail.

The first issue of his large terrestrial globes seems to date
from the year 1622, though the suggestion is not wanting
that he had actually completed the celestial globe before
the close of the year 1616.

With but slight variation in the form of the expression,
we find on all examples of his largest globes the inscription
&#8220;Amstelredami. Excusum in aedibus auctoris ...,&#8221; indicating
at least that the printing was done in the author&#8217;s34
Amsterdam workshop. All have a diameter of about 68 cm.,
though the mountings of the several known examples differ
somewhat.

The Hispanic Society of America possesses a fine example
of the terrestrial globe, dated 1622 (Fig. 95). The ball
is formed of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;, having over its surface a thin
coating of plaster made perfectly smooth and shellacked to
receive the thirty-six engraved gores, or twice eighteen half
gores, and the usual circular polar caps. It is well preserved,
considering its great size and its age, though somewhat
injured in the region of the western Mediterranean, in the
East Indian Islands, in West Africa, in South America, and
in parts of the Pacific Ocean. It is furnished with an elaborate
wooden base, a considerable part of which appears to
have been added subsequent to that constituting the main
support, a horizon circle of wood, and a meridian circle of
brass. The map is a fine example of the work done in the
Netherlands by the copper engravers and printers of the
period, in particular of the work which issued from the
Blaeu press. Continental outlines are well drawn, lands and
seas are crowded with geographical records, including individual
names and legends. Very artistically designed ships
sail the oceans singly or in fleets, and compass lines as well
as loxodromic lines are very numerous, radiating from centers
distributed over the surface of the map. Much of the
original color which had been artistically applied by hand
still remains, particularly on the southern hemisphere, which
has been less exposed to the light and to careless handling.
The author and date legend placed near the south pole in an
artistic cartouch reads, &#8220;In ista quam exibimus, terreni globi
descriptione omnium regionum juxta et insularum, quotquot
hacetnus a nostris Argonautis, vel etiam ab aliarum gentium
Naucleris visae et notatae, loca in suo secundum longitudinem
et latitudinem situ, summa sedulitate et industria
disposita invenies, quae res non solum Geographiae studiosis
jocunda, verum etiam iis, qui terras longe dissitas et sub alio
35sole calentes frequentent, maxime utilis futura est. In quorum
gratiam etiam rhombus nauticos (ita vocantur Helices
lineae secundum ventorum plagus delineatae) quam accuratissime
expressimus. Hunc igitur laborem nostrum ut tam
Gratis animis accipiatis, quanta sedulitate a nobis est obitus,
ex aequo omnes rogatos volo. Guiljelmus Caesius Auctor.
Anno CICICCCXXII.&#8221; &#8220;In this terrestrial globe, which we
here present, you will find all the regions and islands as far
as they have been seen, up to the present, and marked by
our navigators, or have been seen and marked by the navigators
of other nations, placed in their own proper position
of longitude and latitude, with the greatest care and industry,
which not only will be a source of pleasure to the students
of geography but also of the greatest utility to those
who visit far distant shores, which are warmed by another
sun. And for their benefit we have also inserted the nautical
rhombs (for so are designated the lines which show the
direction of the winds). This labor of ours I hope and pray
you will accept with as much gratitude as we have bestowed
care upon it. Willem Caesius. In the year 1622.&#8221;
A citation of all legends which the author has placed on
his map would indeed fill many pages, and but few of
these are here quoted.

Fig. 95. Terrestrial Globe of Willem Jansz. Blaeu, 1622.

In the southern hemisphere, and particularly conspicuous
by reason of the artistic cartouch in which it is placed, we
find a reference to the question of the proper location of the
prime meridian,40 somewhat lengthy but quoted here in full.
&#8220;Quamvis longitudinis initium arbitrarium esset, ab occasu
tamen ejus auspicium facere ideo veteribus placuit quod illic
aliquis terrae limen esset, qui ortum versus nullis expeditionibus
deprehendi potuisset. Atque eam ob causam Ptolemaeus
(cujus sedulitati et industriae Geographiae incolumitatem
omnes, vel inviti, debent) ab ultimo termino
occidentis cognito, quae Insulae in Atlantico Mari Fortunatae
dictae sunt, auspicium fecit in eisque primum Meridianum
defixit: quod theticum principium deinceps fere omnes ejus36
auctoritate moti retinuerunt. Interim hoc seculo nonnulli
hoc principium ex ipsa natura eruendum censuere. Qua in
re acus Magneti junctae indicium sequendum sibi sumpserunt,
eumque primum Meridianum statuunt quo in loco ea
Boream spectat Quos plane allucinari addita illa Magneti
vis convincit, penes quem nullum longitudinis arbitrium sit,
cum is ipse sub eodem meridiano varium habeat enclisin
prout huic aut illi continenti vicinus fuerit. Sed et illi ipsi
qui ita sentiunt, ob instabile magnetis indicium, in primo
Meridiano, multum inter se dissentiunt. Quamobrem ut
summo Geographiae commodo, certus aliquis Meridianus
tamquam primum principium servari et retineri possit,
Ptolemaei vestigiis insistentes, easdem Insulas, et iis Junonem,
quae Teneriffa vulgo creditur, delegimus, cujus excelsa
illa et praerupta petra, perpetuis nebulis obsessa, Indigenis
El Pico dicta, primi Meridiani terminus esto. Qua in re ab
Arabum longitudinibus (qui extrema Africae littora versus
occidentem delegerunt), vix unius gradus quadrante abimus
diversi: quod quoque monuisse operae pretium putavi.&#8221;
&#8220;Although the beginning of longitude is arbitrarily selected
nevertheless it pleased the ancients to begin the counting of
it from the west, because there was the limit of the earth,
as some thought, while no expedition to the east was able
to determine this. Therefore Ptolemy, to whose application
and industry all men, even though unwilling to admit it,
owe the preservation of geography (geographical science),
made the location (of the beginning of longitude) in the
farthest known limit of the west, which is called the Fortunate
Islands, in the Atlantic Ocean, and in them he fixed
the first meridian. This hypothetical beginning, almost all
who came after him retained because of his influence. But
in our century there are some who have said that this beginning
should be taken from nature herself, and in this matter
they have taken the indication of the magnetic needle as
their guide, and fix the first meridian in that place in which
the needle points to the true north: That this is clearly an37
error is proved by this additional (and peculiar) property
of the magnetic needle, that on the same meridian it has a
variation according as it is near to this or that continent.
But the very men who think this, on account of the uncertainty
of the variation, disagree much among themselves as
to where the first meridian is to be located, and so for the
highest good of geography, that this same fixed meridian as
a first beginning may be marked and be retained, we ourselves,
following in the steps of Ptolemy, have chosen the
same islands as he, and from their number that one which is
called Juno, or commonly Tenerif; of these (islands) that
high and steep rock beset by perpetual clouds and called by
the natives El Pico, shall for us be the location of the first
meridian. In this matter, from the longitude of the Arabs,
who selected the shore of Africa farthest toward the west,
we vary scarcely the fourth part of a degree, and this I
thought worthy to be noted.&#8221;

There is a brief but important legend near the Strait of
Magellan reading, &#8220;Fretum Magellanicum, sic dictum a
Ferdinando Magellano Lusitano, qui omnium primus id
aperuit atque emensus est, anno 1520, Franciscus Draach et
Thomas Candish, uterque anglus Fretum emensi sunt, ille
anno 1579, hic anno 1587. Oliverius van Noorth et Georgius
Speilbergius, uterque Belga annis 1600 et 1615.&#8221; &#8220;The
Strait of Magellan, so called by Ferdinand Magellan a
Portuguese who was the first to discover it and to sail
through it in the year 1520, Francis Drake and Thomas
Candish, both Englishmen, sailed through the strait, the
one in the year 1579, the other in the year 1587. Oliver van
Noort and George Spilbergen, both Belgians in the years
1600 and 1615.&#8221; Near the last-quoted legend we find &#8220;Fretum
Le Maire a Wilhem Scouten Hernano et Jacobo Le
Maire per eum inventum et lustratum Ao 1616.&#8221; &#8220;The
Strait of Le Maire discovered and surveyed by Wilhem
Scouten and Jacob Le Maire in the year 1616.&#8221; To the
northwest in the Pacific we find &#8220;Magellanus ad insulas has38
delatus, cum in iis nec hominum ulla vestigia, nec quicquam
humano usui opportunum invenisset, Infortunatus nuncupavit.&#8221;
&#8220;Magellan came to these islands and finding in them
no trace of man nor of anything suitable for human use
called them the Unfortunate Islands.&#8221; Near New Guinea is
the information recorded &#8220;Novissime detecta et lustrata est
a Wilhelmo Scouten anno 1616.&#8221; &#8220;Very recently discovered
and surveyed by Wilhelm Scouten in the year 1616.&#8221;

In the far north is a reference to the attempts made by
numerous explorers to find a passage to the east by way of
the north, reading, &#8220;Quemadmondum post apertum a Lusitanis
iter illud ad regiones orientales, quod Promontorium
Bonae Spei navigantes circumducit non defuere qui et ante
Ferdinandum Magellanum, breviorem aliquam per Septentrionem

ac toto orbe decantatus, Moluccas, indagarent viam: et
nominatim quidem anno jam tum 1500, duobusque seqq.
Gaspar et Michael Cortereales, fratres lusitani, et post eos
anno 1507, Sebastianus Cabotus venetus: ita et post superatum
jam a praedicto Magellano Fretum, quod de ejus
nomine Magellanicum dicitur, extitere celebres aliquot
praestantes naucleri, qui ne codem quidem itinere contenti,
tum per easdem regiones septentrionales Caurique tractus,
tum per Aquilonaria quoque Moscoviae Tartariaeque littora,
idem tentaverint. Tales, ut alios nunc omittam, fruere anno
1553 Hugo Willoughbeus, Eques anglus, annis 1576 et 77
Martinus Forbisherus, et annis 1585, 86, 87 Ioannes Davisuis,
uterque itidem anglus, item Guilijelmus Bernard et
Ioannes Hugo Linschotanus, Batavi, annis 1594, 95 et 96.
Quibus omnibus etsi, post incredibiles exantlatos labores,
conatus non successissent, non destitere tamen Henricus
Hudsonus, et ipse anglus ac post eum Batavi quidam Amsteredami
emissi, eandem terram (quod dici solet) reciprocare.
Is Hudsonus anno 1611, superato, ad Americae borealis
oras, sub latitudinis 61, 62 et 63 gradu, ut indicat globus
noster, praelongo freto, in exitu ejus engens ac late diffusum,39
invenit pelagus: cujus quidem detectio, multis spem addidit
fore ut tandem inibi transitus aliquis inveniatur. Utrum
vero huic spei eventus sit responsurus, propediem, quod
vovemus, ipsum tempus ostendet.&#8221; &#8220;When the way had been
opened by the Portuguese to the eastern regions which led
the navigators round the Cape of Good Hope, there were
some who said there was a way, even before Ferdinand
Magellan, a shorter way by the north and the northwest to
those opulent and world famous regions, the Moluccas. To
name these, in 1500, the two brothers Miguel and Gaspar
Cortereal, and after them in the year 1507 Sebastian Cabot
a Venetian, and after the Strait had been navigated by the
aforesaid Magellan, which is called the Strait of Magellan
after him, there were certain famous and excellent navigators
who, not content with a knowledge of this passage,
attempted another both by the same northern and northwestern
route and by the northern coasts of Moscovie and
Tartary, among these, to omit others for the present, there
were in the year 1553 Hugo Willoughby an English Knight:
in the years 1576 and 1577 Martin Frobisher: in the years
1585, 86, 87 John Davis, both of the last named being
Englishmen: also William Bernard and John Hugo Linschoten,
Dutchmen, in the years 1594, 95, 96. Although
none of these attempts, in spite of the Herculean labors,
were successful, nevertheless Henry Hudson, himself an
Englishman, and after him certain Dutchmen sent from
Amsterdam, did not give up the attempts to find that land,
as it was called. Hudson himself, in the year 1611, having
navigated along the shore of North America in latitudes 61,
62, and 63, as our globe indicates, a very long inlet at its
farthest extremity discovered an immense and far-stretching
sea, the discovery of which gave hope to many that at
last some outlet would be found therein. Whether the event
would answer to this hope, and we pray it may, only time
will tell.&#8221;41 Somewhat nearer the pole we read &#8220;Anno 1594
et seqq. Illm&#772;orum D. D. Ordinum Foederatorum, anno vero40

immensis e glacie coacervatis montibus impedito, ulterius
possent tendere, tertio postremoque itinere, quo loco casam
a nobis expressam vides, hibernare coacti sunt.&#8221; &#8220;In the
year 1594 and the following years, by the command and
under the auspices of the illustrious Lords of the United
Netherlands, and in the year 1596, under the auspices of
the distinguished Senate of Amsterdam, the brave sea captain
Jacob Heelmstrech, and with him the skilful navigator
William Bernard&#8217;s son, both citizens of Amsterdam, sought
passage by the north to the regions of Cathay and China.
When they had passed the shore of Nova Zembla to latitude
78, without being stopped by the immense mountains of ice,
and could have gone further, on this third and last journey
they were compelled to pass the winter at the spot where
you see a hut depicted by us.&#8221; In addition to the above
legends we find such as &#8220;Hic anno 1611 H. Hudson hibernavit.&#8221;
&#8220;Here in the year 1611 Henry Hudson passed the
winter.&#8221; &#8220;Huc usque processit H. Hudson anno 1612.&#8221;
&#8220;As far as this Henry Hudson came in the year 1612.&#8221; In
the western part of North America, that is, in &#8220;Nova Albion,&#8221;
there is a legend referring to the expedition of Francis
Drake, reading, &#8220;Hoc loco ad latitu. 42 grad. appulsus
Franciscus Dracus in gentem incidit prorsus indolatricam, et
quod merito quis miretur ipso adeo mense Junio prae frigoris
quam acerrime saevientis vi coactus est, terram hanc Novae
Albionis nomine a se decoratam deserere.&#8221; &#8220;In this place, at
latitude 42&deg; Francis Drake came upon a tribe wholly idolatrous
and what is justly to be wondered at, in the month of
June he was compelled by the violence of the cold that
41raged here to desert this land of New Albion which he distinguished
with its name.&#8221;42

The great inland sea appearing on the large world map
of Jodocus Hondius of the year 1611 (Fig. 96), and called
&#8220;Mare Septentrionale Americae,&#8221; is here represented as
&#8220;Lacus iste quantum ex accolis colligi potuit trecenta ut
minimum miliaria in longitudinem pateat.&#8221; &#8220;This lake, as
far as can be learned from the inhabitants, stretches at least
three hundred miles in length.&#8221;43

This representation is of particular interest in connection
with a grant to the London Company, as expressed in its
charter of the year 1609 wherein the jurisdiction of the
company is defined as extending &#8220;In that part of America
called Virginia, from the point of land called Cape or Point
Comfort, all along the sea coast, to the northward two hundred
miles, and from the said point of Cape Comfort, all
along the sea coast to the southward, two hundred miles,
and all that space and circuit of land, lying from the sea
coast of the precinct aforesaid up into the land, throughout
from sea to sea, west and northwest.&#8221;44 It is of further interest
to note that on this globe of Blaeu there appears for
the first time on a dated map the representation of Manhattan
as an island.

The Osservatorio Astronomico, located near Florence,
possesses a fine pair of Blaeu&#8217;s large globes, the terrestrial
being signed, at the conclusion of the address to the reader,
&#8220;Guiljelmus Blaeu&#8221; instead of &#8220;Guiljelmus Caesius,&#8221; as on
The Hispanic Society&#8217;s copy, although as on this copy the
signature &#8220;Guiljelmus Caesius anno 1622&#8221; appears on the
celestial globe. The dedications of these Florentine examples
read, &#8220;Serenissimo Potentissimoque Principi Ferdinando
Secondo Magno Etruriae Duci, Domino Suo Clementissimo.
Suos hosce Coelestem et Orbis Terrarum Globos accuratius
pleniusque quam hanctenus descriptos editosque L. M. D.
C. Q. Humillimus Cliens Guilielmus Blaeuw.&#8221; &#8220;To the
Most Serene, Most Powerful Prince Ferdinand II, Prince42
of Etruria, his Most Clement Lord, these globes, both celestial
and terrestrial, more carefully and more accurately depicted
and edited than has been done previously, Willem
Blaeu His Most humble client dedicates and consecrates.&#8221;
It may here be noted that Ferdinand II was of the house of
Medici and that he came to the throne in the year 1621.

A pair of Blaeu&#8217;s globes of 1622, signed &#8220;Guiljelmus
Caesius,&#8221; belongs to the Biblioteca Comunale of Palermo,
reported to be without mountings and otherwise in bad condition.
Most of the terrestrial globe map is missing but
there remains enough of each to determine their original
likeness to the preceding pair.

In the archaeological section of the Biblioteca Gambalunghiana
of Rimini there may be found a well-preserved
pair, each dated 1622.

A terrestrial globe dated 1622, and a celestial clearly
intended as its companion but dated 1616 and signed &#8220;Guilielmus
Janssonius,&#8221; belong to the Biblioteca Barbarini of
Rome. If correctly dated it is evident that Blaeu completed
his work on this globe of large size in the same year that
he completed his work on the smallest of all his globes, to
which attention has been called above. These examples are
in a fair state of preservation, having each a base consisting
of a single column supported on the backs of two satyrs
who are seated with hands upraised.

A pair of these globes of 1622 may be found in the Museo
Civico of Venice with dedication differing from those which
have been previously noted. On these globes we read, &#8220;Serenissimo
Potentissimo Gustavo II ejus nomine Suedorum
Gothorum, Vandalorum Regi et Principi hereditario,
Magno Duci Finlandiae, Estmanniae, Westmanniaeque
Domino Suo Clementissimo, Suos hosce coelestem et Ordis
Terrarum Globos accuratius pleniusque quam hactenus descriptos
L. M. D. C. Q. Humillimus Cliens Guiljelmus
Caesius.&#8221; &#8220;To the Most Serene and Most Powerful Gustavus
II, King and Hereditary Prince of the Swedes, Goths,43
and Vandals, the Mighty Ruler of Finland, Eastmania and
Westmania, his Most Clement Lord, these his celestial and
terrestrial globes more accurately and fully depicted and
edited than previously, Willem Caesius, his humble client
dedicates and consecrates.&#8221;

A copy of the 1622 celestial globe, signed &#8220;Guilielmus
Caesius,&#8221; belongs to the Stadtbibliothek of N&uuml;rnberg, and a
copy of the same, dedicated to Gustavus II of Sweden, is in
the possession of Reichsgraf Hans von Oppersdorf in Oberglogau.

Eleven additional pairs of Blaeu&#8217;s globes, reprints, and
reissues, not all agreeing in details, but alike in their main
features, have been located. These belong to the years 1622-1640,
having only an occasional record or date in legend to
indicate, though indefinitely, the year of construction. A
very brief reference to these editions here follows.

A pair may be found in the Osservatorio Astronomico of
Bologna, somewhat damaged by neglect and careless handling.
It seems probable, though the records are imperfect,
that these are the globes referred to in an old catalogue of
the Specola Library, and that they have been in the observatory
since its founding in the year 1724.45

The Royal Estense Library of Modena is in possession of
a well-preserved pair of Blaeu&#8217;s large globes, as the librarian
has kindly informed the author.46 Each is supplied with an
artistic wooden base, with a meridian and a horizon circle,
the whole being about 79 cm. in height. Each is furnished
with a domelike cover of pasteboard, over the outside of
which, and crossing at right angles, are two bands of carved
leaves, and in each of the four spaces thus formed is a decoration
consisting of the lily of the Royal House of France.
It appears not to be known how or when these globes came
to the Estense Library; perhaps as a gift to a prince of the
Ducal House of Este, from a member of the House of
Orleans, or they were purchased perchance by an Estense44
ambassador once having residence in Holland, as has been
suggested.

Other undated pairs of the 1622 and 1640 issues may be
found in the Seminario Vescovile of Chioggia, in the Museo
di Strumenti Antichi of Florence, in the Biblioteca Governativo
of Lucca, in the Biblioteca Nazionale of Naples, in the
Biblioteca Chigi of Rome (Fig. 97), in the Collegio delle
Scuole Pie of Savona, in the Liceo Marco Foscarini of
Venice (Fig. 98), in the Pinacoteca Quirini of Venice, and
in the private library of Count Francesco Franco of Venice.
A copy of the terrestrial only may be found in the Biblioteca
Comunale of Como, in the K&ouml;nigl. Math. Phys. Salon
in Dresden, in the Istituto Tecnico of Florence, in the Biblioteca
delle Misione Urbane of Genoa, in the Germanisches
Nationalmuseum of N&uuml;rnberg, and a copy of the eighteen
unmounted terrestrial globe gores, probably of the year
1647, in the British Museum. A copy of the celestial globe
only may be found in the Biblioteca Civico of Aquila in the
K&ouml;nigl. Math. Phys. Salon of Dresden, and one in the British
Museum, which is reported, however, to have a diameter
of only twenty-four inches.

The Biblioteca Barbarini of Rome possesses four armillary
spheres, all appearing to be of the early seventeenth
century. A description of two of these, neither signed nor
dated, it has not been possible to obtain; two are the work
of J. Paolo Ferreri, the one constructed in the year 1602
according to the brief record &#8220;Jo. Paulus Ferrerius f. f. an.
1602,&#8221; and the other in the year 1624 being inscribed &#8220;Fco
gio. Paulo Ferreri Rono ano 1624.&#8221; Professor Uzielli has
given to the author the information that these are of brass,
having each a graduated horizon circle supported by four
half circles which in turn rest on a single brass column.
Through this horizon circle passes an adjustable meridian
circle 39 cm. in diameter, which is graduated and which supports
other movable circles, such as the colures carrying the
polar circles, the tropics, which are graduated, and the ecliptic,45
a broad band inclined 23&frac12; degrees to the equator, likewise
graduated and engraved with the names of the months
and of the constellations of the zodiac. Within the circles
of each of these spheres, placed at what may be called their
common center, is a small solid sphere to serve as a representation
of a terrestrial globe but without geographical
details. There appear to be but slight differences in the construction
of these two armillary spheres, the one of 1624
having certain circles which are slightly smaller than are
the corresponding ones on that of earlier date. From the
same source it is learned that the artist, Tito Lessi of Florence,
possesses an armillary sphere signed and dated &#8220;Lud:
s Sem: s Bon: Fac: A. D. MDCXII,&#8221; near which is a representation
of a coat of arms with a dragon. The sphere is of
brass, the diameter of its greatest circle being 63 cm. We
know nothing of the Ludovico referred to as the maker, but
who, as is noted, was a Bolognese. The same artist, as we
are informed, likewise possesses another unsigned and undated
armillary sphere which presumably is of the early
seventeenth century.

Peter Plancius (1552-1622), a native of Drane-outer,
West Flanders, is especially remembered as a militant theologian
(Fig. 99) and as one of the most influential men
active in the shaping of the colonial policy of the States
of the Netherlands in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth
centuries. His was indeed a stormy career wherein it
touched the Reformation movements. In early life a monk,
he later became an ardent reformer supporting the Calvinistic
faith. After passing some years in Germany and in England
in study, he became, in the year 1578, a pastor in the
city of Brussels. When persecution threatened him, he fled,
in the year 1585, to Amsterdam, where he again became a
pastor, exerting for many years a far-reaching influence in
matters touching the relations of the reform movements and
the state. Plancius, however, was not only learned in matters
theological, he was interested, as stated above, in Dutch46
colonial enterprise, was a geographer, and a map and globe
maker of great distinction. He in part planned and actively
supported the Dutch expeditions of Barents, Hemskerken,
Linschoten, and Le Maire, who undertook to find new routes
to the Indies, both East and West. He assisted in the organization
of the East India Company, which company made
large contributions to the commercial prosperity of the
Netherlands.47 He was instrumental, with his countryman,
William Usselinx, and others, in organizing the West
India Company.48 He took an active part in the planting of
New Amsterdam in the New World, and in the establishment
of Batavia in Java. He was counselor for twenty-five
years in practically all matters pertaining to the welfare of
the peoples of the Netherlands.

Fig. 99. Portrait of Peter Plancius.

As map maker Plancius appears to have begun his activities
shortly after taking up a residence in Amsterdam. His
great world map in two hemispheres, one of his first productions,
and one which may in part have served Blaeu and
Hondius in the preparation of their masterpieces, of the
years 1605 and 1611, respectively, was issued in the year
1592, a unique copy of which belongs to the Collegio del
Corpus Christi of Valencia.49 This map, bearing the title
&#8220;Nova et exacta terrarum orbis tabula geographica ac hydrographica,&#8221;
is composed of eighteen sheets, which, when
joined, give a world map measuring 146 by 233 cm. Blundeville
makes interesting reference to this map under the following
caption: &#8220;A Plaine and full Description of Petrus
Plancius his vniuersall Mappe, seruing both for Sea and
Land, and by him lately put forth in the yeere of our Lord
1592. In which Mappe are set downe many more places, as
well of both the Indies, as Afrique, together with their true
Longitudes and Latitudes, than are to be found either in
Mercator his Mappe, or in any other Moderne Mappe whatsoeuer:
And this Mappe doth show what Riches, Power, or
Commodities, as what kind of Beasts both wild and tame,
what Plants, Fruits, or Mines any Region hath, and what
47kinds of Merchandize do come from euery Region. Also the
diuers Qualities and Manners of the People, and to whom
they are subiect. Also who be the most mightie and greatest
Princes of the World: A Mappe meet to adorne the House
of any Gentleman or Merchant, that delighteth in Geographie:
and herewith this Booke is also meete to be bought,
for that it plainely expoundeth euery thing contained in
the said Mappe.&#8221;50 Blundeville notes further that Plancius
drew another map of the whole earth in two hemispheres,
employing the polar projection. He does not give the date of
this map, but it presumably was issued shortly after that of
1592. A Plancius world map in two hemispheres, bearing
title &#8220;Orbis terrarum typus de integro multis in locis amendatus,
auctore Petro Plancio 1594,&#8221; appears in the account
of Linschoten&#8217;s expedition of 1599.51 It is a well-drawn
map, containing much valuable geographical data. Like
Mercator, Hondius, and Blaeu, Plancius also undertook the
construction of globes. Of these the oldest known appears
to have been begun as early as the year 1612, the date
appearing in the following dedication, &#8220;Nobilissimis Amplissimis
Consultissimis ac Prudentissimis Dominis Consulariis
Thalassiarchis atque Thalatto Oratoribus Hollandiae
Zelandiae et Frisiae occidentalis nec non Magnificis ac
Clarissimis Dominis Consulibus praeclarissimi Emporii Amstelodami,
Petrus Kaerius humillimus cliens L. M. Q. dat,
dicat, dedicat. Anno 1612.&#8221; &#8220;To the Most Noble, Exalted,
Learned and Prudent Consular Lords and Orators Maritime
of Holland, Zeeland and West Friesland, also to the
Great and Distinguished Lords Counselors of the Renowned
Emporium of Amsterdam, Peter Kaerius their humble client
gives and dedicates (this globe). In the year 1612.&#8221; Below
the legend is engraved &#8220;Petrus Kaerius excudit ann. 1614,&#8221;
the date here given clearly indicating the year of issue. Not
far from the dedicatory legend appears the following:
&#8220;Ipsa experientia peritos Naucleros docuit volubiles libellas
magnetis virtute infectas in Insulis Corvi et Florum48
Mundi polos recte respicere: idcirco ibi, taquam a communi
Mundi Magn. Meridiano Logitud. justis de causis initum
sumunt Petrus Kaerius et Abrahamus Goos patrueles sculptores.&#8221;
&#8220;Experience itself has taught skilful mariners that
loose leaves when under the electrical influence, in the islands
of Corvo and Flores, turn directly toward the poles of the
world, and for this reason it is here, as a common magnetic
meridian of the world, that Peter Kaerius and Abraham
Goos his cousin, engravers, locate with reason the beginning
of longitude.&#8221; The customary address to the reader, though
here not so designated, reads, &#8220;In hujus nostri Globi delineatione
ubique castigatissimas Tabulas Hydrographicas ac
Geographicas sequuti sumus, quibus Germani, Hispani,
Galli, Itali, Angli, Scoti, Dani, Norvegi, Suedi nec non et
navigationibus utuntur: ad quae omnia comparanda nulli
nec labori nec sumptui pepercimus: ventorum quoque regimmes
ad usum navigantium admussim accomodavimus:
quemadmodum artis periti, proprius inspiciendo, reperient.
Vale ac frere. Petrus Plancius.&#8221; &#8220;In the delineation of this
our globe, we have everywhere followed the most correct
hydrographic and geographic tables which the Germans,
Spaniards, French, Italians, English, Scotch, Danes, Norwegians
and Swedes use in their voyages. In doing this we have
spared no labor nor expense. The directions of the winds
(loxodromic lines) we have laid down with great exactness
for the use of sailors, as those experienced in navigation will
see on close inspection. Farewell and be happy. Peter Plancius.&#8221;
This gives us definitely to understand that this terrestrial
globe was the work of Plancius.

The sphere is covered with a world map engraved on
twelve gores, truncated at latitude 70 degrees, the polar
spaces being covered by the usual circular discs, each having
in this case a radius of twenty degrees.

On his celestial globe, probably issued at the same time
as the terrestrial just referred to, and intended as a companion
of the same, having the same dimensions, we find
49the following legend: &#8220;In hac coelesti sphaera stellae affixae
majore quam hactenus numero ac accuratiore industria delineantur.
Novos Asterismos in philomath&#275;om gratiam de
integro addidi: quae omnia secundum Astronomorum Principis
Tychonis Brahe, ac meam observationem verae suae
Longitudinis ac Latitudinis ad annum Christi 1615 restitui.
Petrus Plancius.&#8221; &#8220;In this celestial sphere the fixed stars
to a greater number than previously and with more exactness
are depicted. I have added for the use of the student
some entirely new star readings according to the prince of
astronomers Tycho Brahe, and also my own observations of
their true latitude and longitude adapting these to the year
of Christ 1615. Peter Plancius.&#8221; It then will be noted that
the position of the stars located thereon is computed to the
year 1615. In the southern hemisphere is a portrait of Tycho
Brahe with the inscription &#8220;D. Tyco Brahe Summ. Mathematic,&#8221;
below which is the legend &#8220;Tabula continens quantum
quovis proposito anno vel addendum vel demendum sit
L&#333;gitudini affixarum: nam hae 70 annorum et 5 mensis
spacio unicum grad&#363; secund&#363; signor&#363; ordin&#275;, super Pol.
Zod. progrediuntur.&#8221; &#8220;Table indicating how much for any
given year is to be added to or to be subtracted from the
longitude of the fixed stars. For these in the space of 70
years and 5 months move one degree reckoned on the signs
of the zodiac.&#8221; But one pair of Plancius&#8217; globes can now be
located, this pair having been acquired a few years since
for the Museo Astronomico of Rome (Fig. 100). They are
reported to be in excellent condition. The spheres are of
wood covered with plaster, having a diameter of about 21
cm., upon which the gores have been pasted. Wind roses
are numerous, from which the usual direction or loxodromic
lines radiate. Ships and sea monsters add to the decoration
of the terrestrial globe map, and the figures of the several
constellations have been artistically drawn. Each globe is
furnished with a wooden base, having its horizon circle supported
by four columns which are joined below by crossbars.50
Each has a brass meridian circle within which the globe
is adjusted to revolve.

Fiorini reports information received from Gabriel Marcel
of the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale and Captain F. v. Ortroy
that there may be found in the Stein Museum of Antwerp a
terrestrial globe of copper, neither signed nor dated, but
which is thought to be the work of Peter Plancius.52 Additional
information concerning this globe has not been obtainable.

Isaac Habrecht (1589-1633), physician and mathematician,
was a native of Strassburg, where he passed the
greater part of his life.53 Incidental references to him assure
that he was regarded in his day as a man of much ability.
Among his publications, not numerous but scholarly, reference
here may be made to his &#8216;Tractatum de planiglobio
coelesti &amp; terrestri,&#8217; issued in Latin in the year 1628, and
again in the year 1666 in both Latin and German, by Johann
Christoph Sturm of N&uuml;rnberg.54 In this work Habrecht
describes his terrestrial and celestial globes, constructed, it
appears, a few years previous to the issue of the publication.

The Hispanic Society of America possesses a fine example
of what appears to be his first terrestrial globe (Fig. 101).
It is undated, but internal evidence assures us that it was
not constructed prior to the year 1612. Near the Arctic circle
and north of the representation of Hudson&#8217;s Bay we
read &#8220;Huc usque retrocesserunt Amstelodamenses anno
1612.&#8221; &#8220;At this point the Amsterdam (explorers) turned
about in the year 1612.&#8221; His first celestial globe, referred
to below, seems clearly to be of the year 1619, and there is
reason for placing his first terrestrial globe in the same year,
since, in their size, and in many of their general features
there is agreement. The globe ball of wood has a diameter
of 20 cm. Its horizon circle, which has pasted on its upper
surface the usual information relative to the names of the
months, to the principal directions, and to the signs of the
zodiac, is supported by four turned legs joined below by
51crossing bars, these bars in turn supporting a carved circular
disc with a raised center through a slot in which the
meridian circle is made to pass. The whole is indeed a remarkably
well-preserved example of Habrecht&#8217;s work.

In an artistic cartouch to the south of the East Indian
Islands and within &#8220;Terra Australis&#8221; is the following
signed dedication: &#8220;Perillustri et Generossissimo Dno Dno
Eberardo Dynaste in Rappolstein. Hohenaccio et Geroltzeccio

Maximiliani Archiducis Austriae. P. M. Camerario et

Lord Eberhardt Ruler in Ruppelstein, Hohenau and
Geroldseck in the Vosges, Divine Emperor Matties II and
also the Most Serene Maximilian Archduke of Austria, the
Exalted President of the Provincial Orders of the Cameria,
and those on this side of the mountains, sprung from the
Ancient Ducal Family of Spoleto, my Most Gracious Lord,
this triple globe, that is celestial, convex and concave terrestrial,
corrected according to the latest information, gives
and dedicates Isaac Habrecht, philosopher and physician of
Strassburg.&#8221; In the northern part of North America is a
legend referring to the expeditions of Davis, Schouten, and
Le Maire reading, &#8220;Versus Articum polum ulterior transgressus
hactenus ab Herculis licet Davis Angli labore id
examinatus fuerit sicut et circa antarcticum fretum noviter
a Guilielmo Schout detectum Le Maire nuncupatum extremus
adhuc navigationum est terminus. Quamvis nullus
dubitet maxima totius orbis magnalia sub polis delitescere
quorum detectionem forsitan summus Deus suo tempore reservat.
Typis Jacop. ab Heyden Argentinae.&#8221; &#8220;Toward the
Arctic pole the last voyage up to the present was made, with52
Herculean labors, by Davis an Englishman. Around the
Antarctic a strait has lately been discovered by William
Schouten and named Le Maire, and this, up to the present,
is the extreme limit of navigation, although no one doubts
that the greatest wonders of all the world lie hidden under
the poles, the discovery of which, it may be that Almighty
God reserves for his own time. Printed by Jacob von Heyden
of Strassburg.&#8221; It is probable that the Jacob von Heyden
here referred to was a relative of Christian Heyden of
N&uuml;rnberg, mathematician and globe maker of renown.55 Below
the legend last quoted is a brief one reading, &#8220;America
septentrionalis a Christoforo Colombo 1492 detecta.&#8221;
&#8220;North America discovered by Christopher Columbus in
the year 1492.&#8221; This appears to have been quoted from the
Hondius globe of the year 1618. The austral continent is
referred to as &#8220;Terra Australis incognita,&#8221; and near New
Guinea is inscribed the following, likewise quoted from
Hondius: &#8220;Sic dicta quod ejus littora locor&#363;q&#541; Guineae Affricanae
multum sint similia. Dicitur a nonnullis Terra de
Piccinaculi; et sit ne insula an pars continentis Australis
incertum est.&#8221; &#8220;So called because its shores are much like
those of African Guinea. It is called by some the land of
Piccinaculi: and it is uncertain whether it is an island or a
part of the Australian continent.&#8221;

A considerable number of brief legends appear upon different
parts of the globe map, each having a local significance.
In coloring the map attention was given to the representation
of territorial boundaries which gives an added
interest to the globe. The &#8220;Meridianus Primus&#8221; is made to
pass through the Island of Corvo, and other meridians are
drawn at intervals of ten degrees. The loxodromic lines, as
on the Hondius globes, are made a conspicuous feature of the
map, having their crossing centers at longitudes 0&deg;, 90&deg;,
180&deg;, and 270&deg; on the equator, and on the prime meridian at
latitude 35&deg; both north and south, as well as at the same
latitude on the opposite side of the sphere, where the prime53
meridian becomes the meridian of 180&deg;. Habrecht appears
to have followed somewhat closely the globes of Hondius
for his geographical data.

In addition to the Habrecht terrestrial globe in The
Hispanic Society&#8217;s collection, two other copies are known,
which likewise are undated. One of these belongs to the
Biblioteca Comunale of Sondrio, and the other to the
Archivo Municipale of Asti.

Of the celestial globes of Habrecht four copies have been
located; one being in the Biblioteca Comunale of Sondrio,
in a good state of preservation; one in the Germanisches
Nationalmuseum of N&uuml;rnberg, wanting, however, the original
mounting, having its map engraved, as stated in a
legend, by Jacob von Heyden et Johann Christoph Weigel;
one in the Biblioteca Comunale of Asti; one in the Royal
Museum of Cassel.

It is strikingly evident that Habrecht followed in the
main the work of Willem Jansz. Blaeu, and Jodocus Hondius
for his celestial globes. As the year 1619 was selected
as the one in which star positions were to be recorded, it
is probable, as intimated above, that these globes were constructed
in that year. Each of the globes referred to is
reported as retaining the brilliant coloring which had been
laid on by hand.

Garcia de C&eacute;spedes, writing in 1606,56 calls attention to
a globe, concerning which nothing farther is known, referring
to it as a &#8220;Globillo que hizo en Portugal aquel grau
Piloto que se emborrachana cuyo nombre no me acuerdo.&#8221;
&#8220;A small globe constructed in Portugal by a great pilot,
whose name is unknown, but who was a great drunkard.&#8221;

In the year 1893 Baron Nordenski&ouml;ld presented to the
Royal Geographical Society a facsimile in gores of a globe
map, which fact is noted in that society&#8217;s Journal. The
globe is one of silver, bearing the author and date legend
&#8220;Johann Hauer. 1620.&#8221; The record tells of its having been
presented in the year 1632 to Gustavus Adolphus and that54
it is now one of the treasures of the National Museum of
Stockholm. The engraved map is of the Hondius or the
Mercator type presenting in the main the best geographical
knowledge of the time. Its many legends are in the Latin
language; the lettering, though small, is easily legible. The
engraver has adorned the seas with ships and with such
marine animals as are frequently to be found in the maps
of the period.57

It has been previously noted that the employment of
engraved gore maps in globe construction was not received
with general favor in Italy in the sixteenth century, although
Mercator&#8217;s globes were copied to some extent, as
were those of De Mongenet. Toward the close of the century,
the preference for manuscript globes, or for engraved
bronze or copper globes seems gradually to have yielded to
a belief in the more practical method of construction which
had established itself in the North. Originality, however,
does not appear to have been a striking feature of Italian
endeavor in this method of globe making. There was an
occasional manifestation of independence and individuality,
it is true, but in general there was a disposition to copy, and
the early seventeenth century furnishes us an example in the
reissue by Giuseppe de Rossi of the work of Jodocus Hondius,
but without credit, as has been previously observed.

Among those who attained distinction in Italy in the first
half of the seventeenth century in the construction of globes
having engraved gore maps, may be named Mattheus
Greuter. He was born in Strassburg in the year 1556, where
he learned designing and engraving. In early life he went
to Lyons in France where he carried on his work, but later
he removed to Avignon, adding to his art in this city that
of type cutting. We next find him in Rome, busily engaged
in the work of engraving, in which he had become exceedingly
proficient, winning for himself a high place among the
Italian artists of his day. Map engraving, we learn, early
claimed his attention, and among his masterpieces in this
55field may be mentioned a large map of Italy. Of this work
no copy is at present known, but it is thought that it probably
served Magini as a model for his &#8220;Italia&#8221; which was
published in the year 1620. It could not have been long
after he had taken up his residence in Rome, where he became
a naturalized citizen, that he began the preparation
of his first terrestrial globe, which he issued in the year 1632.
So well did he perform his work that he is entitled to rank
with the leading globe makers of the Netherlands.

An excellent example of this first issue may be found
in the Museum of The Hispanic Society of America (Fig.
102), this being one of the most valuable in its large collection.
It has a diameter of 50 cm., and is mounted on a
wooden base having four feet, which, though evidently very
old, is clearly not the original base. It is furnished with a
narrow wooden horizon circle which is not graduated, and
the calendar and other representations, which one usually
finds pasted on this circle in early globes, are entirely wanting.
The meridian circle of iron, likewise, is not graduated,
and like the wooden base is not a part of the original mounting.
The sphere itself is remarkably well preserved, there
being scarcely a noticeable injury to its surface save the
slight discoloration of age. The engraved gore map covering
the papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; ball, which is of very light construction, is
composed of twelve sections, or rather of twenty-four, since
each of the sections is cut at the equator, and the poles are
covered with small circular discs.

Fig. 102. Terrestrial Globe of Mattheus Greuter, 1632.

In the south Atlantic and near the great southern continent,
in a neat cartouch surmounted by the coat of arms
of the Boncompagni family of Bologna, is the following
dedication: &#8220;Illustrissimo et Excellentissimo Principi D.
Iacobo Boncompagno Sorae Arcisque Duci Marchioni Vignolae
Aquini Comiti Dno suo colendissimo. Mattheus
Greuter Humill. obseqii ergo. D. D.&#8221; &#8220;To the Most Illustrious
and Excellent Prince Lord Jacob Boncompagni, Duke
of Sora and Arce, Marquis of Vignola and Count of Aquino,56
his Most Worshipful Lord Mattheus Greuter with humble
obedience dedicates (this globe).&#8221; Iacopo Boncompagni, to
whom Greuter dedicated his work, belonged to a famous
family of Bologna.58 He was born in Sora in the year 1613
and died in the year 1636. It was his great-grandfather,
Hugo, who, in the year 1572, at the age of seventy, became
Pope Gregory XIII, and who immortalized himself through
his reform of the calendar. Iacopo, the grandfather of that
member of the family to whom Greuter dedicated his globe,
was in position, at the time of the elevation of his father
to the Papacy, to have bestowed upon him great honors
and riches. He was nominated Castellan of St. Angelo, and
shortly thereafter, receiving the title General of the Holy
Church, was sent to Ancona with a commission to defend
the maritime regions of the papal states. He was soon
thereafter admitted to the nobility of Rome, of the Kingdom
of Naples, and of Venice. Through the riches of the
Papacy he was able to purchase from Alfonso II of Este the
Marquisate of Vignola for seventy-five thousand Roman
scudi, the Duchy of Sora and of Arce from the Duke of
Urbino for one hundred and ten thousand ducats, and the
lands of Arpino and Roccasecca, together with the County
of Aquino from Alfonso of Avalon, Marquis of Guasto, for
one hundred and forty thousand ducats.

In the austral continent, and on the opposite side of the
globe to that on which the dedication is placed is an address
to the reader which is inscribed in a neat cartouch, reading
&#8220;In ista quam exhibemus terreni globi descriptione omnium
regionum iuxta et insularum quotquot hactenus ab Argonautis
tam Lusitaniae quam aliarum gentium Naucleris
visae et notatae loca in suo secund&#363; longitudinem et latitudinem
situ sum&#772;a sedulitate et industria disposita invenies
quae res non solum Geographiae studiosis juc&#363;da, verum
etiam ijs, qui terras longe dissitas et sub alio sole calentes
frequentent, maxime utilis futura est. H&#363;c igitur laborem
nostrum ut tam gratis animis acceptatis sedulitate a nobis57
est obitus ex aequo omnes rogatos volo. Mattheus Greuter
auctor. Excudit Roma Anno MDCXXXII.&#8221; &#8220;On this globe
which we exhibit, you will find all the regions and islands
as far as they have hitherto been seen and noted by navigators
of Portugal and of other nations, set down in their
proper positions of latitude and longitude with the greatest
care and industry. This will be pleasing not only to students
of geography but it will be especially useful to those who
visit far distant lands (which are) warmed by another sun.
I hope therefore that all those whom I ask will accept this
labor of ours with as much gratitude as we have employed
care upon it. Matthew Greuter maker. Made in Rome in the
year 1632.&#8221; This address agrees with that on the Blaeu terrestrial
globe of 1622 except that Blaeu wrote &#8220;vel etiam
ab aliarum gentium ...,&#8221; whereas Greuter writes &#8220;tam
Lusitaniae quam aliarum gentium ...,&#8221; and Blaeu inserted
a reference to the loxodromes he had drawn on his
map, which loxodromes Greuter, omitting, had therefore no
occasion for such reference. In the inscription referring to
the prime meridian, Greuter again borrowed from Blaeu
with scarcely an alteration, as he did in his reference to
recent discoveries made for the purpose of finding a way to
the East by the North. Blaeu&#8217;s legend in the vicinity of the
Tiborone Island, that near the Cape of Good Hope, and that
near the Strait of Magellan were all copied literally by
Greuter, and likewise that referring to the Le Maire Strait.

Greuter employed, in general, for the names of the regions
of the Old World and for the seas, the Latin language,
though he wrote &#8220;Mar del Nort&#8221; for the Atlantic and &#8220;Mar
del Zur&#8221; for the Pacific. For the names of the New World
he used the Spanish or the Portuguese, but occasionally the
English, the French, the Dutch, or the language native to
the region bearing the name. For the names of the cities he
generally employed the language of the country or the
Italian language.

Numerous ships are represented sailing the seas, and the58
pictures of sea monsters are many. A few wind roses adorn
the map, but, as before stated, loxodrome lines, regarded in
general at that time as of great importance to sailors who
had occasion to make use of the chart or the globe, were
omitted by Greuter.

Hudson Bay, which is left nameless, is represented without
a definite coast line in the north, but through a wide and
extended channel it opens into &#8220;Fretum Davis.&#8221; The St.
Lawrence River appears to drain a lake, which may be taken
from its location to be Lake Ontario; but the remaining four
Great Lakes appear as one great inland sea with an outlet
of somewhat uncertain character northward toward Hudson
Bay. The geographical representations in this region
are of special historical interest, as are indeed the geographical
records in the several sections of North America, particularly
in the South and the West.

As a companion to the terrestrial globe of the year 1632,
Greuter prepared a celestial globe of the same dimensions,
and with similar mountings, which he issued in the year
1636. He gives due credit, in one of his legends, to Tycho
Brahe and to Willem Blaeu as sources of information for
his representation of the stars and the several constellations,
following, in particular, Blaeu&#8217;s globe of 1622. His explanatory
legend reads &#8220;In hoc coelesti Globo notantur omnes stellae
fixie an annum 1636 accom&#772;odatae q&#772; iuxta observation&#275;
Nob. viri Tychonis Brahe, in max&#772; illo Iansonii, an&#772;o 1622
edito, positae sunt additis stellis q&#772; &agrave; peritisso nauclero Petro
Theod: circa Pol. Aust. notatae s&#363; novisque Asterismis et
stellis min. appar&#275;tib&#8217;, ab aliis sum&#772; studio observatis, omnia
in Philomatico gratia copiosa delineata. Romae, 1636, M.
Greuter.&#8221; &#8220;In this celestial globe are noted all the fixed
stars accommodated to the year 1636, which are placed (on
the map) according to the observations of the noble Tycho
Brahe in that great (work) of Jansson (Blaeu), edited in
the year 1622, to which are added the stars noted by the
skilful navigator Peter Theodori around the south pole and59
the new and less apparent stars observed by others with
great zeal. All these have been represented for the use of the
student. At Rome, 1636. M. Greuter.&#8221; As to how much he
thought should be added to or subtracted from the longitude
of the fixed stars each year, to the end of taking due note
of the precession of the equinoxes, he copied Plancius literally.
The equatorial circle, the tropics, the polar circles, the
equinoxes, the solstitial colures, the ecliptic, and twelve
meridians are all represented. The constellations include the
Ptolemaic, with the addition of those recently discovered
and named in the southern hemisphere. The figures of the
several constellations are well drawn, having their names
in Latin or in Arabic, and are artistically colored in most
of the copies of the globe known.

Greuter&#8217;s globes all appear to have been made in the same
size, and they have the same general construction, with the
exceptions noted below.

A pair of these globes, that is, of the terrestrial, of the
year 1632 and the celestial of 1636, may be found in the
following public and private libraries and museums in addition
to those above mentioned: Scuole Comunale of Ancona;
in the Biblioteca Comunale of Bologna; in the Biblioteca
Comunale of Camarino; in the Seminario Vescovile of
Carpi; in the Biblioteca Comunale and also in the Museo
Agabiti of Fabriano; in the Biblioteca Comunale of Ferrara;
in the Biblioteca di Santa Maria Nuova of Florence; in the
Biblioteca Comunale of Gubbio; in the Biblioteca Governativo
of Lucca; in the Biblioteca Capitolari of Reggio; in the
Museo Astronomico, also in the Biblioteca Chigi and
the Biblioteca Vittorio Emanuele of Rome; in the Biblioteca
Comunale of Sanseverino; in the Biblioteca Gonzaga
of Mantua; in the Biblioteca Universitario of Messina; in
the Biblioteca Nazionale of Milan; in the Museo Civico of
Modena; in the Museo di Fisica and also in the Seminario
Vescovile of Padua; in the Biblioteca Palatina of Parma
and a pair in the possession of Joseph Baer &amp; Company of60
Frankfurt, 1914. A copy of the terrestrial globe of the year
1632, in addition to the one described above as belonging
to The Hispanic Society of America, may be found in the
Biblioteca Comunale of Bassano; in the Ateneo of Brescia;
in the Museo di Fisica of Catania; in the Archivo di Stato
of Venice. In private libraries copies of these globes may be
found in the possession of the General Antonio Gandolfi of
Bologna; of Sr. P. Marezio Bazolle, once belonging to the
Counts of Piloni of Belluno; of Professor Luigi Bailo of
Treviso; of Sr. D. Luigi Belli of Genga. A copy of the celestial
globe of the year 1636 may be found in the Biblioteca
Comunale of Serra S. Quirico, and also a copy in the library
of Mr. W. B. Thompson of Yonkers, N. Y.

It does not appear that Greuter himself issued other editions
of his globes. His death occurred in the year 1638, and
in this same year what may be called a second edition of his
globes of the years 1632 and 1636, having the same dimensions,
was offered to the public. It has been noted above that
one Giuseppe de Rossi of Milan reprinted in Rome, in the
year 1615, the Hondius terrestrial and celestial globes of
1601, making but slight alterations in the same but giving
the impression that he was the original author. It was perhaps
a near relative of this Milanese engraver and printer,
Giovanni Battista de Rossi, who in the year 1638 reprinted
in Rome the Greuter globes with but few changes, none of
which can be considered of special import save the introduction
of his own name as printer instead of that of Greuter.
It may, however, be noted that both globes are dated
1636, that below the Tropic of Capricorn on the terrestrial
globe is the legend &#8220;Si stampa da Gio Bat&#772;ta de Rossi Milanese
in Piazza Navona. Roma,&#8221; and that the title legend of
the celestial reads &#8220;In hac coelesti sphaera stellae fixae majori
quam hactenus numero et accuratiori industria delineantur
novis Asterismis in Philomaticom&#772; gratiam de integro
additis: quae omnia secundum Astronomorum Principis
Tychonis Brahe et aliorum observationem verae suae longitudini61
ac latitudini ad annum Christi 1636 restituta sunt.
Romae Matteus Greuter exc. 1636.&#8221; &#8220;In this celestial globe
are shown the fixed stars in greater number than previously,
and with greater care and industry, the new constellations
being added for the sake of the student. All these, according
to the observations of the Prince of Astronomers, Tycho
Brahe, and likewise the observations of others, have been
assigned to their proper latitude and longitude for the year
of Christ 1636. Made at Rome by Mattheus Greuter 1636.&#8221;

A pair of these globes of the second edition may be found
in the private library of Cav. Giampieri-Carletti of Piticchio
in the Marche; in a private library of Ancona (owner unknown);
in the Seminario Vescovile of Toscanella. A copy
of the terrestrial globe may be found in the Seminario Vescovile
of Macerata; and of the celestial in the library of Count
Francesco Conestabile of Perugia.

The Hispanic Society of America has in its collection a
unique globe which is clearly the work of Mattheus Greuter
(Fig. 103), although issued by Giovanni Battista de Rossi,
as is attested by the legend, &#8220;Si Stampa da Gio Batta de
Rossi Milanese in Piazza Navona Roma.&#8221; This legend, appearing
in a neat cartouch, occupies the same position in the
southern hemisphere, near the prime meridian, as that in
which one finds the dedication of his first issue, but that part
of the cartouch in the earlier issue showing the coat of arms
of the Boncompagni family is here left blank. The title of
the first issue is repeated save in the concluding words. Here
we read &#8220;In iste quam exhibimus ... Mattheus Greuter
auctor. Excudit Romae 1638.&#8221; Other legends, such as those
in the northern part of North America beginning, &#8220;Post
apertum a Lusitanis ...,&#8221; that southeast of Africa beginning,
&#8220;Quam longitudinis initium ...,&#8221; and the
briefer ones referring to the discovery of the Cape of Good
Hope, to the expedition of Schouten, and to that of Magellan,
are identical in the two editions. It, however, is to be
noted that many of the briefer legends appearing in the62
first edition are wanting in this of the year 1638, and that
in the latter the place names are greatly reduced in number.
It is further particularly worthy of note that the North
American continent in this later issue is very much altered
in its outline. California appears as an island, &#8220;Insula California,&#8221;
and is separated from the great northwestern section
of North America, which is likewise represented, though
somewhat doubtfully, as an island, by the &#8220;Stretto di
Anian,&#8221; while the &#8220;Estreito de Jeso&#8221; separates the New
World from Asia. The globe ball has a diameter of 26 cm.
Its mounting is of wood. It has a broad horizon circle, on
which are the representations of the signs of the zodiac, the
calendar, the Roman and the Italian names of the winds or
directions appearing in concentric circles, the whole being
supported on a base consisting of four exquisitely carved and
rather heavy support columns which are joined below by
carved cross bracings. Its meridian circle is a comparatively
recent and very clumsy substitute of wood for the original
which doubtless was of brass. It is very seldom that one finds
a globe of a date so early as is this which is so well preserved.
The engraved map has the freshness of a new and unused
print, excepting a very slight yellow tinge which is the contribution
of age. On this globe map may be found one of the
earliest attempts to give boundary lines to territorial divisions
in the New World such as &#8220;Virginia,&#8221; &#8220;La Florida,&#8221;
&#8220;Nuovo Mexico,&#8221; &#8220;N. Amsterdam,&#8221; &#8220;N. Suetia.&#8221;

Attention has previously been called to the reproduction
in Italy of the Hondius globes by Giuseppe de Rossi in the
year 1615. It appears that to the Rossi family belonged a
number of map engravers and art printers during the seventeenth
century and particularly to that branch making its
home in the city of Rome. As globe makers we however find
them playing the r&ocirc;le of copyists rather than that of independent
producers.

In The Hispanic Society&#8217;s collection of old globes may be
found a pair in an excellent state of preservation signed
63&#8220;Dominici de Rubeis (Rossi),&#8221; and dated &#8220;1695.&#8221; Each
globe ball is composed of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;, having a diameter
of 49 cm. and each is covered with a map printed on twelve
gores, with a small circular disc for the polar space (Figs.
103a, 103b). In the List of Globe Makers other examples are
noted.

In the South Pacific, on the terrestrial globe, one finds the
inscription &#8220;Romae ex Chalcographia Dominici de Rubeis,
heredis 70. Jacobi, ad templum S. Mariae de Pace, Anno
1695.&#8221; Dominico, whose name here appears, achieved considerable
distinction as the publisher, with his relative
Giovanni Giacomo de Rossi, of an atlas of one hundred and
fifty-two maps, one of the finest examples of Italian cartography
of the period. In a cartouch in the South Atlantic, on
this globe, we find the name Mattheus Greuter given as the
engraver, whose work has been referred to above, clearly
suggesting that Rossi had merely reissued a globe of earlier
date, since Greuter had died in the year 1638. A careful
examination of the globe map confirms the suggestion, since
no record is made of geographical discoveries after the year
1630. In the region of the North Pole the discoveries of the
English and of the Dutch are recorded to the year 1628, and
it may further be noted that in this same northern region
the islands of &#8220;Frislanda&#8221; and &#8220;Brasil&#8221; are laid down,
while in Greenland is a reference to the location of the
fabled Monastery of St. Thomas.

References are made in legends to the discoveries of
Magellan, Lemaire, Schouten, Frobisher, Davis, Hudson,
and Drake. The region about New York is called &#8220;Nieu
Nederland.&#8221; One can recognize the representation of the St.
Lawrence, and the Mississippi. In the western region of the
New World there appears to be considerable confusion as to
the geography of the country, apparently the result of reading,
without understanding, the records of the Spanish and
of the English. One finds, for example, California represented64
as an island, and a double representation of the
Strait of Anian.

The Spanish, French, English, Dutch, and Latin languages
have been employed in names and legends.

The mounting of the globe is artistic and substantial, consisting
of the usual horizon circle, octagonal on its outer
edge, but circular on the inner edge to receive the globe ball,
and having pasted on its upper surface the usual engraved
paper strips and all that there is engraved thereon in the best
examples of globe making. The meridian circle of wood,
within which the sphere is made to revolve, is graduated.
The supporting base consists of four exquisitely turned
columns, braced at bottom with correspondingly well-turned
crossbars.

The celestial globe has a mounting altogether like that
of the terrestrial, and in the character of the map engraving
there is agreement. The figures of the several constellations
are copies of these drawn by Tycho Brahe, and all have been
exquisitely colored. Stars from the first to the sixth magnitude
are represented, while special attention is called to the
new star in Cassiopeia first appearing in the year 1572, and
to the comets of the years 1597 and 1616. Near Ursa Major
is the author and date legend reading &#8220;In hoc Caelesto
Globo notantur omnes stellae fixae, ad annum 1636 accommodatae,
quae iuxta observationes Tychonis Brahae maximo
illo Jansonii anno 1622 edito positae sunt, additis stellis
quae a nauclero Petro Theod. circa Polum Australem notatae
sunt ... Romae ex chalcographia Dominici de Rubeis,
her. Jo. Jac. de Rubeis anno 1695.&#8221;

The twelve gores of the map have been mounted so as
to join at the north and south poles of the ecliptic, there
however being a small covering disc at each pole, so frequently
employed since Mercator&#8217;s day, the globe itself
being made to revolve on its equatorial axes.

To the makers of armillary spheres in the first half of the
seventeenth century there may be added the name of Adam
65Heroldt, a native of Germany. We know little, however,
of the extent of his activities. One example of his work is
known, which bears the simple inscription engraved near the
south polar circle &#8220;Adam Heroldt fecit Romae anno dn&#772;i
MDCIL.&#8221; &#8220;Made by Adam Heroldt in the year 1649.&#8221; This
sphere once belonged to the astronomer De Gasparis of
Naples, but passed some years since into the collection of
the Museo Astronomico of Rome. It is constructed entirely
of brass, the diameter of the largest circle being about 14
cm. Its several circles, including the polar, the equatorial,
the zodiacal, and the horizon, are graduated, the last-named
having engraved on its surface the names of the months and
of the winds, and resting on two semicircles, which in turn
are supported by an artistically designed foot. The entire
height of the sphere is about 20 cm. At the north pole is an
hour circle bearing the inscription &#8220;Index Hor: Italic.&#8221;
Within and at the common center of the several circles is a
small ball representing the terrestrial sphere, which has a
diameter of but 1 cm., and within the circle of the ecliptic
and co&ouml;rdinated with it is a ring carrying the sun, while
within this is one for the moon. The piece may be referred
to as a fine example of the armillary sphere of the period.

Manfredo Sett&agrave;la (1600-1680)59, a nobleman of Italy,
was in his day a distinguished promoter of science and art,
and an intelligent collector of rare objects, which he brought
together in a museum of his own founding. This he described
in a work bearing title &#8216;Museum Septalianum,&#8217; which was
published in Italian in the year 1666 by Scarabelli. This
museum later passed into the possession of the Ambrosiana
of Milan, where it has been considered one of the choicest
additions.

Sett&agrave;la had included globes in his collection, among
which there has previously been mentioned that made by
the Cremonese Gianelli, in the year 1549. But not only was
he a collector; he likewise became interested in the actual
work of globe construction. Among the objects coming to66
the Ambrosiana from his museum is an armillary sphere
bearing the inscription, &#8220;Manfredus Settalius fecit MDCXLVI.&#8221;60
It is described as a sphere having a base of brass,
its several circles including those representing the zodiac,
the equator, the meridians, and the horizon, all being movable
on a common axis, on which axis at the common center
of the circles is a small ball 4 cm. in diameter, representing
the earth. To this sphere rather extravagant praise is given in
the descriptive catalogue referred to above.

There is a third armillary sphere belonging to the Sett&agrave;la
collection, which is of silver and which probably was
constructed near the middle of the seventeenth century, although
it is neither signed nor dated. It is 40 cm. in height,
having a circle representing the ecliptic 15 cm. in diameter,
which is graduated, having on its upper surface engraved
figures representing the twelve zodiacal constellations. The
meridian circle has a diameter of 16 cm., the horizon a
diameter of 16 cm. and a breadth of 3 cm., on the upper
surface of which have been engraved the names of the
months, and the signs of the zodiac. In addition to the parts
mentioned it has two small polar circles, and at the common
center a small silver ball 1 cm. in diameter representing the
earth.

Attention has been previously called to the transfer of
the business of Jodocus Hondius into the hands of the son-in-law,
Johan Janssonius, and of Abraham Goos, by whom
it was carried on after the year 1640. This firm continued
to issue the Hondius globes, modifying them from issue to
issue with the addition of some of the latest geographical
information obtainable. In the year 1648, with Johan Janssonius
as editor and Abraham Goos as author and engraver,
there was issued a pair of these revised Hondius globes, each
having a diameter of 87 cm. On the terrestrial globe we read
&#8220;Amstelodami Edebat Joannes Jansonius Sculpebat magnoque
studio componebat Abrahamus Goos Amstelodamensis.&#8221;
&#8220;Amsterdam. Edited by Johan Jansonius. Composed
67with much study and engraved by Abraham Goos a native
of Amsterdam.&#8221; Further details concerning this globe have
not been obtainable, but it is very certain, although differing
in size, it contains practically all the features common to the
earlier editions of the Hondius terrestrial globes, and especially
of the later ones.

The celestial globes have the following inscription:
&#8220;Sphaera nova summo studio summaque diligentia atque
industria Clarissimi viri D. Adriani Metii Watheseos apud
Frunequeranos Professoris Ordinarii ad abacos Nobilissimi
viri Thiconis Brahe configurata observationibus quamplurimis
tum circa polum arcticum a discipulo suo Houtmanno
adhibitis aucta et in annum 1620 reducta. Edente Joanne
Jansonio 1648.&#8221; &#8220;A new globe constructed with the greatest
industry, zeal and diligence accommodated to the tables of
the most noble Tycho Brahe, enlarged by very many observations,
those around the Arctic pole being made by myself,
and those around the Antarctic by his disciple Houtmann.
All, accommodated to the year 1630. Constructed by Johan
Jansonius, 1648.&#8221; A pair of these globes may be found in the
library of the Marquis Borromeo of Milan.

degrees. Since the actual difference in longitude is but 34 degrees his error
was of considerable magnitude, which found expression in his maps, and
in the maps of those who followed him, as the greatest of geographical
teachers, well into the seventeenth century. The method of determining
longitude by means of the observation of the eclipses of the moon remained
practically the only method until the end of the fifteenth century. Attention
may here be called to work of Cassini and of other astronomers of his
period. See II, 141.

Historians of this period in American history, with scarcely an exception,
have taken it for granted that the expression &#8220;from sea to sea&#8221; means from
the Atlantic to the Pacific, apparently not stopping to inquire as to the
geographical notions entertained at the time of the granting of the Charter
concerning the regions in question. The interpretation here offered takes
into consideration the fact that Jodocus Hondius, perhaps the most distinguished
geographer and map maker of his day, was much in favor in
England at the time of the formation of the London Company and was
much consulted concerning the geography of the New World. What he
thought of the Virginia region to the &#8220;west and northwest&#8221; he has laid
down in his large world map. It seems all but proven that the statement
&#8220;from sea to sea west and northwest&#8221; means from the Atlantic to the great
but indefinite inland sea &#8220;Mare Septentrionale Americae.&#8221;

To interpret this expression as meaning from the Atlantic to the Pacific
shows the historian, as Freeman has stated it, &#8220;in bondage to the modern
map.&#8221; Here is a striking illustration of the importance attaching to the
study of historical geography, and to its subordinate branch, historical
cartography. Blaeu, Plancius, Greuter, and others, if not so clear and
emphatic in their presentation of this region, evidently entertained practically
the same geographical notion as Hondius.

Chapter XI

Globes of the Second Half of the
Seventeenth Century

Certain striking tendencies exhibited in the matter of globe making
in this period.&mdash;The Gottorp globes.&mdash;Weigel&#8217;s globes.&mdash;Carlo
Benci.&mdash;Amantius Moroncelli.&mdash;Castlemaine&#8217;s immovable
globe.&mdash;The armillary of Treffler.&mdash;Armillary sphere of Gian
Battista Alberti.&mdash;The numerous globes of P. Vincenzo Coronelli.&mdash;Certain
anonymous globes of the period.&mdash;Joannes
Maccarius.&mdash;Jos. Antonius Volpes.&mdash;Vitale Giordani.&mdash;George
Christopher Eimmart.&mdash;Giuseppe Scarabelli.&mdash;Giovanni Battista.&mdash;Joseph
Moxon.&mdash;The Chinese globes of Peking.

AMONG the globes constructed in the second half of
the seventeenth century there were none which surpassed
in scientific value, if indeed any equaled,
those sent out from the workshops of the Netherland masters
in the first half. The work of P. Vincenzo Coronelli, the
Venetian monk, crowns the period. His abilities were of a
high order, and entitle him to a place among the world&#8217;s
great map and globe makers, but the traces of his influence
seem not to be so pronounced as were those of his immediate
northern predecessors.

The period was one which lent encouragement to some
extravagance in globe making. The earliest of those constructed
in the post-Columbian years, as has been noted, were
of small size, but before the close of the sixteenth century
we occasionally find one of large dimensions, as, for example,
that of the great Danish astronomer, Tycho Brahe.73
Blaeu&#8217;s globes of the year 1622 were thought to be of extraordinary
size, but the half century here under consideration
furnishes us with examples of globes having gigantic
proportions, globes such, for example, as would have pleased
the Greek geographer, Strabo,61 who thought that one to be
of value should have a diameter of at least ten feet. The
Gottorp globe, the globes of Weigel, the Coronelli globes
constructed for Louis XIV, were not such as would lend
themselves to easy duplication, certainly not as to size,
ranging as they did from about nine to fifteen feet. Of real
value they possessed but little. They were interesting mechanical
curiosities, representing a tendency in globe construction
which might be referred to as the ultrapractical. In
the following century we find the opposite extreme exemplified
in what were known as pocket globes.

The so-called Gottorp globe, constructed in the years
1654-1664, at the instance of Duke Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp,
we may refer to as the first one of importance of
the period, as it was one of the largest, being, however,
rather an object62 of interest by reason of its peculiar construction,
than one of great scientific importance for the
study of astronomy and geography. This globe, about eleven
feet in diameter, was prepared by Andreas Busch of Limberg
under the direction of Adam Oelschl&auml;ger (Olearius)63
(1599-1671), Duke Frederick&#8217;s librarian and court mathematician.
The world map on the outer surface of the sphere
included a record of the recent discoveries according to the
most reliable sources of information. It was furnished with
a brass meridian circle, and within this it was so adjusted
as to make one revolution every twenty-four hours. The pole
elevation could not be altered, it being permanently set for
the latitude of Gottorp, that is, for latitude 54&deg; 30&#8242;. Its
horizon circle was broad, and served as a platform upon
which an observer might walk, he being thus enabled to
examine the terrestrial map to the best advantage. A door
was provided which could be opened and closed, permitting74
not less than twelve persons to enter the sphere at one time.
On its inner surface was represented the entire expanse of
the sky with the several constellations properly located,
having their figures carefully outlined; the several stars
being placed according to calculation for the year 1700, and
each star was gilded that it might the more easily be seen.
From the inner axis was suspended a circular gallery or platform
from which the machine could be set in motion, and
from which, as representing the horizon, one might observe
the rising and the setting of the stars. The whole interior
was lighted by two small lamps. At the center of the sphere,
the inner surface of which, as stated above, represented the
starry heavens, was placed a small ball, about 15 cm. in
diameter, representing the earth. The great globe, driven by
water power, was therefore made to appear to revolve
around this central terrestrial globe. A representation of the
sun, made of glass, had its own proper motion along the circle
of the ecliptic, and a representation of the moon likewise
was made to move in its own proper course. This globe, in
the year 1713, was presented by the grandson of Duke Frederick
to Czar Peter the Great of Russia.

A note in the Royal Geographical Journal refers to this
as a seventeenth-century globe, adding in substance that the
St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences has lately installed at
Tsarskoe Selo this large globe, weighing some three and one
half tons, constructed in the seventeenth century for Duke
Frederick of Holstein, under the superintendence of Olearius,
the astronomer and traveler. On its completion it was
placed in the castle of Gottorp, from which fact it became
known as the Gottorp globe. It was presented to the Academy
in the year 1725 and up to the present has remained
in the Zo&ouml;logical Museum.64

Fig. 104. The Gottorp Armillary Sphere, 1657.

Information has been kindly given by the director of the
National Museum of Copenhagen that an exceedingly fine
armillary sphere (Fig. 104) may be found in the Museum
of National History in the Friedricksborg Castle. From the
75catalogue of this institution we learn that it was constructed
in the year 1657 by Andreas Busch, under the guidance of
Adam Olearius, for Frederick III of Holstein-Gottorp. As
will be noted from the illustration it is an elaborately constructed
piece of mechanism. What we may term the globe
proper is composed of six great circles on which are the
fixed constellations, having the several stars represented in
silver. Through the mechanism passes a steel bar which carries
a ball of brass representing the sun, which is at the
center of the complicated system of circles. Around the sun
are six circles of brass representing the orbits of the planets
each carrying a small silver angel. That part of the mechanism
which represents the equator and the zodiac is calculated
to make one revolution in 25,000 years. In the base
of the globe has been placed the clockwork by which the
several movements of circles and planets are effected, and
time is told by the striking of hours and quarters. Topping
the piece is a small armillary sphere representing the Ptolemaic
system.

We are likewise informed that in the National Museum&#8217;s
collections may be found a celestial globe which is attributed
to Petrus Theodorus. It is of gilded brass, having a diameter
of 24 cm., and while undated presumably is of the last
quarter of the seventeenth century. The globe ball is supported
by a bronze figure of Atlas, the whole standing 86
cm. in height. Tycho Brahe is the accredited authority for
the representation of the several fixed stars.

Erhard Weigel (1625-1699)65 has place among the globe
makers of the period as one who sought to reform, and, in
some measure, to popularize both astronomical and geographical
science, particularly the former, applying his own
inventive ability to that end in the matter of globe construction.
In this he appears to have been rather more ingenious
than practical. He seems to have achieved special distinction
in his day as theologian, philosopher, astrologer, and
mathematician.76

Weigel was a native of the Rhenish Palatinate. Under
many difficulties, on account of the poverty of the family, he
acquired the necessary educational training for admission
into the University of Halle. Here he soon found himself in
favor with Professor Bartholemeus Schimpfer,66 who was
counted one of the leading astrologers of the time. In addition
to the youthful student&#8217;s general duties as secretary to
the professor, there was assigned to him the task of calendar
making. This was a task which especially appealed to him,
and he soon had a following, as a tutor, among those students
who like himself found the astrological science one
of absorbing interest. Led by the fact that students from the
University of Leipzig came to him for instruction, he transferred
his residence from Halle to this University, thinking
thereby to improve his opportunities for mathematical studies.
Here he continued his astrological work, not so much, it
appears, because of a genuine belief in the practical value of
the science, as such; the rather because he found in its pursuit
a good source of income.67 His theological bent soon led
him to a conclusion that the science of astrology rested upon
a very unsubstantial foundation. &#8220;If God be the creator and
supporter of the universe, what an insignificant part,&#8221;
thought he, &#8220;can the stars play in determining the destiny
of the individual.&#8221;

In the year 1654 he became a professor of mathematics in
the University of Jena and sprang immediately into favor
as a lecturer.68 Naturalism, as heralded in his day, appealed
to him and he became an outspoken opponent of the Latinists
and of the Scholastics. When his knowledge of mathematics
failed him he was inclined to resort to theology as a subject
furnishing endless themes and illustrative material. From
his early belief in astrology he turned to astronomy, but he
remained a visionary, making some contribution to the science
but none of lasting value. He appears to have been
particularly distressed over the heathen names of the several
constellations and the figures which so long had been employed77
to represent them, regarding such representations as
sacrilegious and wholly unworthy the great inventive genius
of man. All this he wished to have swept from the heavens,
proposing to substitute for the same the coats of arms of the
ruling houses of Europe.69 For Ursa Major he proposed the
name Elephas with the figure of the Danish elephant, for
Orion the name Aquila biceps and the Austrian double
eagle, for Hercules the name Eques cum districto gladio and
the insignia of Poland, for Leo the name tria Castella cum
Aureo Vellere and the insignia of Spain, for Erichthonius
the name Lilia tria and the insignia of France, for Lyra the
name Citharae and the insignia of Britain, running thus
through the entire list. In assigning his new names to the
constellations he endeavored, in so far as possible, to assign
them to such relative position in the heavens as the respective
countries or houses occupied on earth.

In one of his publications70 Weigel describes his several
mechanical devices, including his globes, to which he refers
as &#8220;Globus Mundanus,&#8221; &#8220;Viceglobus,&#8221; &#8220;Globus coelestis
perpetuus,&#8221; and &#8220;Geocosmus,&#8221; the latter being referred to
by the author as a useful terrestrial globe, which exhibits
not only all countries, but the time of the day and of the
year in all localities; also the wind and the rain and volcanic
eruptions. Coronelli gives a brief description of the same,
which he calls a &#8220;Pancosmo, o Mondo Universale,&#8221; from
which, in the main, the following is taken.71

This machine, he says, has a circumference of thirty-two
feet, being constructed in the form of an armillary sphere.
On its surface the stars are represented, each in its proper
size and place, and Coronelli, perhaps indirectly quoting
Weigel&#8217;s own opinion of his production, notes its real superiority
to nature, for he states that the stars, as represented,
can be seen at all hours of the day and night and as well in
sunshine or rain. This &#8220;Pancosmo&#8221; was made to appear, in
its mounting, as if standing or resting on the clouds, the
whole being supported by two statues each eight feet in78
height, the one representing Hercules and the other Athene.
Through a door, which was practically invisible, the great
sphere could be entered by a considerable number of persons
at one time, and be enjoyed by them, implies Coronelli, some
standing and some sitting. It was so arranged within that
when one half of the celestial sphere was lighted the other
half remained in darkness, the revolution of the sphere giving
a representation of the rising and the setting of the stars.
At the center was placed a small terrestrial globe within
which was a reservoir; this could be made to serve in a representation
of the subterranean fires which issued, at times
most opportune, from the craters of volcanoes represented,
such as Vesuvius and Aetna in the south of Italy, others in
the East Indian Islands and still others in America. &#8220;They
give out steam, flames, and pleasant odors,&#8221; says Coronelli,
&#8220;which please the spectators.&#8221; By means of a screen and
lantern it was made possible to represent the inhabitants of
any country desired, moving about as in actual life, even
&#8220;the antipodes,&#8221; says the author, &#8220;with heads downward
and feet upward.&#8221; At pleasure a breeze could be made to
blow from any desired quarter, meteors could be made to
flit across the sky; rain- and hailstorms, lightning and thunder,
could be imitated. On the surface of the terrestrial
globe were represented the several countries of the earth,
likewise the several seas. Coronelli notes that which
Weigel seems to have regarded an especially commendable
feature, the grouping of the stars into new constellations,
which grouping was particularly designed to aid the
memory. This of all the large globes constructed in the
period seems especially to have represented the ultrapractical,
and we have no knowledge that it was ever regarded in
any other light than as a great mechanical wonder. The
final disposition of this &#8220;Pancosmo&#8221; is unknown. G&uuml;nther
doubts that globes such as Weigel proposed to construct are
still in existence. He, however, refers to a globe in the collection79
of the Germanisches Museum which exhibits the constellations
somewhat after Weigel&#8217;s plan.

That a certain preference manifested itself in Italy, during
the greater part of the sixteenth century, and among
certain individuals interested in geographical and astronomical
matters, in engraved metal globes or in globes with
manuscript maps, has been previously noted. An argument
frequently advanced in opposition to that favoring the use
of printed maps was that the manuscript globe could the
more easily be made of large size, indeed could easily be
made of any desirable size. The later years of the seventeenth
century furnish us with excellent examples in proof
that a preference for such globes lingered in certain circles
in the peninsula.

Carlo Benci (1616-1676), a Silvestrian monk, born in the
Tuscan town of Montepulciano, may be named as one of
the foremost among the manuscript globe makers of the
period.72 At the age of twenty-one he entered the monastery
of S. Benedetto of Fabriano, receiving in the ceremony attending
his admission the name D. Doroteo. One year later
we find him in the monastery of S. Giovanni in Montepulciano,
and in the year 1652 in the convent of S. Stefano del
Cacco of Rome, on entering which he changed his name to
D. Carlo Benci, we are told, attained to a place of eminence
among men of learning in Italy on account of his philosophical
and theological studies. In the year 1645 he was chosen
for an administrative office in his order, and later he successively
became sacristan, curate prior, and titular abb&eacute; of
S. Bonifazio near Cingoli in the Marche, retaining to the
end of his life the headship of the parish of S. Stefano.

To his fame as philosopher and theologian he seems to
have added that of expert cosmographer, winning through
the wide extent of his interests the special favor of Pope
Clement X, who selected him as his spiritual adviser. It
must be noted, however, that his name nowhere appears
especially conspicuous among contemporary writers on philosophical,80
theological or scientific subjects, and we have
only the tangible evidence of his cosmographical interests
in a fine pair of globes constructed in the year 1671, now
belonging to Prince D. Camillo Massimo of Rome.

These globes have a diameter of about 1 m. and still
retain the greater part of their original mounting, which, in
each, consists of a meridian circle (this in the terrestrial
globe is modern) not graduated, within which they are
adjusted to revolve on their equatorial polar axes, of a
horizon band, likewise not graduated, being circular on the
inner edge, but octagonal on the outer, the whole being
supported by four turned legs joined by crossbars at their
lower extremities. Both spheres are of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; and are
well preserved, the terrestrial having suffered slightly more
injury than the celestial. The spheres are covered with somewhat
irregular pieces of paper, though carefully matched,
which are yellow with age. On this paper surface the maps
terrestrial and celestial were drawn with a stylus.

On a plate attached to the terrestrial globe we find a dedication
to Pope Clement X, this being surmounted with a
coat of arms of the Altieri family, of which family Pope
Clement was a member. This dedication reads:

&#8220;Beatissimo Padre. Non si debbono questi due globi rappresentanti
il Cielo e la Terra da me con diligente studio
composti consecrare ad altri che alla Sta Vra, come quella,
che dell&#8217; uno maneggia le Chiavi e dell&#8217; altra regge lo Scettro.
Considerava io, che l&#8217; Imperio di Vra Beatitne per non
avere confini, che lo restringano, &egrave; contanto vasto, che non
pu&ograve; quasi essere da humano intendimo compreso, poich&egrave; non
ha la Terra, n&egrave; monte, n&egrave; fiume, n&egrave; l&#8217;Oceano istesso, che i
termini gli prescriva, n&egrave; ha il Cielo, n&egrave; Asterismo, n&egrave; gruppo
di stelle s&igrave; folto che faccia sbarra et impedisca che l&#8217; autorit&agrave;
della St&#772;a V.r&#772;a non giunga alle porte dell&#8217; Empireo, che
chiude e disserra a suo talento. Quindi riflettendo io sopra
l&#8217;ampiezza o per cos&igrave; dire incomprensibilit&agrave; del suo sacro
Regno, per agevolare il suo conoscimo mi disposi di portare81
quasi in compendio de l&#8217; uno e l&#8217;altro orbe, cio&egrave; Celeste e
Terreno, in queste due moli di giro non ordinario la descritione
dove possa l&#8217;occhio con un semplice sguardo ravvisare
ci&ograve; che non pu&ograve; la nostra mente con la sua acutezza comprendere,
e dove la S.t&#772;a V.r&#772;a, sollevata tal&#8217; hora dal peso
delle cure gravissime, possa rivolgere le luci per contemplare
la D. grandezza del suo Sacro dominio. Di qui spero che
V.r&#772;a Beatitudine sia per gradire queste mie deboli fatiche,
come di un suddito che porta il carattere di suo servitore
attuale, e che sia per misurare dalla grandezza di queste
Sfere l&#8217;eccesso delle obbligazioni che le professo. E. qui
augurandole l&#8217;et&agrave; e gl&#8217; anni di Nestore, le bacio humilmente
prostrato a terra i Santissimi piedi.

&#8220;Di S. Stefano del Cacco di Roma li 28 di Dicembre 1671
&#8220;Di V.r&#772;a Beatitudine.
&#8220;Hummo Devotmo Obligmo servre e Suddito
&#8220;D. Carlo Benci Monco Silvestrino.&#8221;73


&#8220;Most blessed Father. These two globes, which represent
the heavens and the earth, constructed by myself with painstaking
industry, ought not to be dedicated to any one but
to Your Holiness, who with one hand controls the keys and
with the other wields the scepter. I reflect that the empire
of Your Holiness, having no boundaries to restrict it, is so
vast that it scarcely can be grasped by the human imagination,
since earth has not mountain, river, or even ocean that
can set limits thereto; nor is there sky, or planet, or star, or
constellation so dense as to check or hinder Your Holiness
from reaching the gate of empyrean which You open and
shut at will. Reflecting therefore upon the expanse, and so to
speak, upon incomprehensibleness of Your Holiness&#8217; Empire,
I determined, with a view to furthering the knowledge
of it to give a representation of both worlds (that is of the
celestial and of the terrestrial), much reduced, as it were,
upon these two spheres of no mean size, on which the eye82
will be able at one glance to recognize what the human
intellect with all its powers is impotent to grasp; and over
which Your Holiness, when at times relieved from the pressure
of overwhelming responsibilities, will be able to cast
your glance in order to view the aforesaid vastness of Your
Dominion.

&#8220;Wherefore I trust that Your Holiness will be inclined
to accept these my feeble labors, as those of a subject whose
real capacity is that of Your Holiness&#8217; servant, and that
You may be willing to take the great size of these globes as
the measure of the vastness of the obligation which I avow
myself under to Your Holiness. And now wishing Your
Holiness the age and the years of Nestor, I humbly prostrate
myself upon the ground, and kiss Your Most Holy Feet.

&#8220;San Stefano del Cacco, Rome, 28, December 1671.

&#8220;Your Holiness&#8217; most humble, most devoted, and most
obliged servant and subject,

&#8220;Dom Carlo Benci
&#8220;Silvestrin monk.&#8221;

Near this dedication is a portrait of the Pope, the subscription
reading &#8220;Clemens Decimus Pont. Max.&#8221;

The terrestrial globe shows the parallels at intervals of
ten degrees, and the meridians at like intervals counting
from that passing through the Island of Ferro which has
been taken as the prime meridian. The polar circles, the
tropics, and the ecliptic are made especially prominent.
Place names and legends are given either in Latin or in
Italian, some of the briefer legends taking note of geographical
discoveries of special importance, and clearly indicating
that the author was well informed on the progress of discovery.

The celestial globe has represented on its surface both
the equator and the ecliptic with their respective poles indicated;
circles of latitude and of longitude are omitted. The
year 1600 was selected as the normal year for recording83
the position of the stars, and a statement is made noting the
corrections becoming necessary by reason of the precession
of the equinoxes. Only the Ptolemaic constellations are
given, and the figures representing the same are very artistically
drawn. The famous star which appeared in the year
1572 and the position of numerous comets are indicated,
with the date of the appearance of each.

Until the year 1862 these globes were preserved in the
Altieri Library, when they were offered for sale and were
purchased by Prince D. Camillo Massimo, finding a place
in his palace at the Villa Peretti.

If Benci, through his cosmographical studies, as well as
through his other studies, brought fame to himself and to
his order of Silvestrin monks, to Amantius Moroncelli, likewise
a member of this order and a contemporary, no less
credit should be given for his achievements as a maker of
manuscript globes.74 It has been noted that but one pair of
Benci&#8217;s globes can now be located, but no less than ten constructed
by Moroncelli may today be found in Italian libraries
and museums, most of which possess both scientific and
artistic value of a high order.

A pair of his earliest globes is in the possession of the
Biblioteca di S. Marco of Venice (Fig. 105). These were
probably constructed as early as the year 1672 for the monastery
of Cassenesi, located on the Island of S. Georgio Maggiore.
The director of the S. Marco Library informs the
author75 that they have a diameter of more than 2 m., and
that through want of proper care they are in a very bad
state of preservation, being so darkened with age as to render
their maps quite illegible. On the terrestrial globe there is
a portrait, opposite which is a representation of the coat of
arms of a bishop. The celestial globe is somewhat better
preserved, having a title, only a part of which can be deciphered,
reading &#8220;In hoc coelesti globo adnotantur omnes
stellae fixae ad annum ... ac cometae,&#8221; and concluding
&#8220;Extruxit D. Silvester Amantius Moroncellus Fabrianensis84
benedictinus sub congregationem Silvestri Abbatis. Venetiis
in Augustissima bibliotheca S. Georgii Majoris....&#8221; The
director of the library reads the date as 1683, others have
thought it to be 1672.

Fig. 105. Terrestrial Globe of Silvester Amantius
Moroncelli, 1672.

In the Biblioteca Alessandrini of Rome may be found
two manuscript globes of Moroncelli, a terrestrial and a
celestial, each having a diameter of about 88 cm. These
spheres are covered with paper gores fashioned as are printed
gore maps, eighteen in number, the polar space being covered
with semicircular sections, two in number for each pole.
On this paper covering the maps were drawn by hand. Each
of the globes is furnished with a brass meridian circle and a
horizon circle of wood, the whole being supported by a plane
base. Under the portrait of Pope Innocent XI is the following
inscription: &#8220;Regnante Innocentio XI. Hos cosmographicos
globos toto studio construxit, calamoque conscripsit, D.
Silvester Amantius Mon. Benedictinus Cong. Silvestrin. Ann.
D. MDCLXXVII.&#8221; &#8220;In the Pontificate of Innocent XI
these cosmographic spheres were constructed with all zeal,
and completed with the pen, by D. Silvester Amantius a
monk of the Benedictine order and of the Silvestrin Congregation.
In the year 1677.&#8221; The legend containing the usual
address to the reader is taken from Greuter&#8217;s globe of 1632
or from Blaeu&#8217;s globe of 1622,76 concluding, however, with
the following, &#8220;D. Silvester Amantius Moroncellus Fabrianensis
Monachus Silvestrinus auctor, construxit et notavit.
Aetatis suae an. 27. 1679.&#8221; &#8220;D. Silvester Amantius Moroncelli
of Fabriano, a monk of the Silvestrin order; constructed
and lettered (this globe) in the 27th year of his
age. 1679.&#8221; On the terrestrial globe meridians and parallels
are indicated at intervals of ten degrees, the prime meridian
passing through the Canary Islands.

On the celestial globe is the following legend or inscription:
&#8220;Laudatissimum Astronomiae studium atquum sit difficilimum,
jucunditas tamen cum difficultate conjungitur,
prospere ut homines et coelum potius quam calcata intueri.
85Creator noster omnipotens cetera animantia per terram sternere
jussit, at homines non sic, sed totum ad sidera extolli.
Pronaque cum spectent animalia cetera terrae Os homini
sublime dedit coelumque videre Jussit, et erectos ad sidera
tollere vultus. Et ideo optimum erat ut aliquod exemplum
sub oculis hic opponeretur quod non immerito in medio
sapientiae sistit, ut sciant non aliter quam et per sapientiam
ipsum posse cognosci.

&#8220;In isto igitur per ipsum coelestium siderum ordinem
cognoscent et nomina astrorum juxta exactum observationem
Hipparchi, Ptolomei, Alphonsi, et Copernici per Ticonem
Brahe ad trutinam examinatiae, et ne octium me opprimeret,
in istud quod cernunt per me accurate delineata.
Ita ut omnes cognoscant in vita quod post mortem omnibus
opto valeant. Romae apud S. Stephanum supra Caccum die
VI men. Jan. MDCLXXX. D. Silvester Amantius Moroncellus
Fabrianensis Mon. Congis Silvestrinorum.&#8221; &#8220;The
much lauded study of astronomy, although it is very difficult,
yet pleasure is joined with the difficulty, for it is a
happier lot for men to look at the sky, than to look at the
road trodden by their feet; our Omnipotent Creator ordained
that other living beings should be prone on the earth, that
man should not be so, but should be wholly lifted up to the
stars. For while other living beings look earthward, He has
given man an uplifted countenance and bidden him look
heavenward, and raise his uplifted face toward the stars.
And therefore it was good that some example should be
placed here under his eyes, which might assist him to stand
in the midst of wisdom, so that men might understand that
God could be known in no otherwise than by wisdom. On
this globe therefore, and by its aid will be known the order
and the names of the celestial stars according to the exact
observations of Hipparchus, Ptolemy, Alfonso, and Copernicus,
and arranged for general use by Tycho Brahe; and that
idleness might not oppress me, accurately depicted by me,
according to their discoveries. This I have done in order86
that all men may know in their lifetime what I hope they
may all attain to know after their death. At Rome, from S.
Stevens on the hill, January 6th, 1680. D. Silvester Amantius
Moroncelli of Fabriano, a monk of the Silvestrin
Congregation.&#8221;

The tropics, the polar circles, and the ecliptic are represented,
and the figures of the several constellations are artistically
drawn, the effect being heightened by skilful shading.

The Biblioteca Municipale of Fermo possesses a fine
manuscript terrestrial globe made by Moroncelli and dated
1713. This globe is not a perfect sphere, having a polar
diameter of 180 cm. and an equatorial diameter of 194 cm.
The ball is composed of thin strips of wood extending from
pole to pole, having first, over the same, a covering of heavy
parchment paper, and over this somewhat irregular but well-joined
pieces of fine draughting paper. It is furnished with a
meridian circle of iron, a horizon circle of wood, the whole
resting on a wooden base. The author and date legend,
placed in a shield-shaped cartouch, reads, &#8220;Opus meccanicum
hoc mirifice compositum ab Ill. m&#772;o Domino Philippo Antonio
Morrono Archipresbitero Firmno Mirificentius vere
geographice distinctum a Revmo P. Abb. D. Silvestro Amantio
Moroncello Fabrianensi. Anno a Redemptore nato
MDCCXIII.&#8221; &#8220;This mechanical work was marvelously constructed
by the Illustrious D. Philip Antony Morono, Archdeacon
of Fermo. Its geographical details were wonderfully
inserted by the Rev. Father Abbot D. Silvester Amantius
Moroncelli of Fabriano, in the year of Redemption, 1713.&#8221;

In a cartouch similar to that containing the legend just
quoted, though much larger and resting on a representation
of the imperial eagle of Fermo, having a white cross on its
breast and the motto &#8220;Firmum firma fides Romanorum
colonia,&#8221; there is drawn a picture of the city of Fermo with a
red background. Near the Tropic of Cancer, on the meridian
of 250 degrees, there is a shield with the coat of arms of the
Morone family, and below the Tropic of Cancer, on the87
meridian of 200 degrees, is the coat of arms of the author,
likewise within a shield and artistically sketched. The picture
of a Moor and of a black eagle, around which is a band
of blue with three golden stars, the whole surmounted by a
prelate&#8217;s black hat with tassels, the Moor indicating the
origin of the name Moroncelli, and the prelate&#8217;s hat honoring
the author&#8217;s intimate friend, Gian Francesco Albani,
who became Pope Clement XI and who had nominated him
a domestic prelate.

In longitude 113 degrees, in a shield, is the coat of arms
of this pope, at the right of which is the inscription, &#8220;Implebitur
vaticinium,&#8221; at the left &#8220;Replebitur majestate omnis
terra,&#8221; and below &#8220;Irradiatibur evangelio, studio recentis
Clementiae et Successorum.&#8221; There are two or three additional
shields, in one of which is an illegible inscription, and
one has been left blank. Although meridians and parallels
are indicated, loxodromic lines are wanting, which so generally
appear on those globes constructed in the Netherlands.
The nomenclature is either Latin, Italian or local. Mythological
and allegorical figures are numerous, as are also
representations of sea monsters and sailing ships.

A pair of Moroncelli&#8217;s globes, in excellent condition, may
be found in the Accademia Etrusca of Cortona. These are
reported to have come to the Academy in the year 1727 as
a gift from the Abb&eacute; Onofrio Baldelli. They have each a
diameter of about 80 cm., are mounted on plain bases, and
are furnished with the usual meridian circles within which
they may be revolved. On the terrestrial globe a legend is
placed within a shieldlike cartouch surmounted with a coat
of arms of the patrician family Baldelli of Cortona, and
reads, &#8220;Virorum probitas, eruditio et virtus existimationem
exigunt. Haec in Illmo D. Abb. Onofrio Baldelli Patritio
Cortonensi mirifice effulgent. Ne dum in Humanis Artibus
summopere praedito. Verum etiam in Magnanimitatem laudabili:
Dum ad complementum Bibliotechae, pro Studiorum
Concivium utilitate et eruditione, ab ipso erectae, globos88
etiam cosmographicos, licet etiam dispendio trescentorum
scutorum libenter auxit. Quamobrem tantis meritis coactus
D. Silr Amantius Moroncelli Fabrianens: Abb: Bened.
Congr. Silvestrinorum Auctor ad perpetuam rei memoriam
Monumentum hoc posuit Ann. Sal. MDCCXIV.&#8221; &#8220;The
uprightness of men, their learning and virtue call for
respect; these qualities marvelously shine forth in the illustrious
lord Abbot Onofri Baldelli of patrician rank of Cortona;
not only was he endowed beyond others in the humanities,
but also he was praiseworthy for his magnanimity. To
furnish the library erected by him, for the use and the instruction
of his student fellow citizens, he generously contributed
these cosmographic globes, although they cost 300
scudi. Wherefore, being executed by his great abilities, D.
Silvester Amantius Moroncelli of Fabriano, Benedictine
Abbot of the Silvestrin Congregation, has erected this
monument for their perpetual remembrance of his generosity.
In the year of our Salvation 1714.&#8221;

A second legend in a less decorative cartouch reads, &#8220;Orbis
Terraquei, juxta presentem notitiam, cum multa adhuc
invenienda remaneant, non solum in Terra Australi incognita,
verum etiam in Septentrionalibus Americae Superioris
ubi molta Jam occulta manent a D. Silvestro Amantio
Moroncelli Fabrianensi Abb: Bened: Congr. Silvest. Cosmographo
Reginae Svecorum, nec non Sapientiae Rom. Anno
etatis sue, 64, Red. v&#862;o MDCCXV.&#8221; &#8220;In our present knowledge
of the terraqueous world much yet remains to be discovered,
not only in the unknown lands of the south, but
also in the northern regions of North America where many
things are still undiscovered. D. Silvester Amantius Moroncelli
of Fabriano, Benedictine Abbot of the Silvestrin Congregation,
Cosmographer of the Queen of Sweden and also
of the Roman Academy (made this globe) in the 64th year
of his age, and in the year of Redemption, 1715.&#8221;

The parallels and meridians are drawn at intervals of
five degrees, and one compass is placed in the southern hemisphere.89
Both Latin and Italian have been employed for the
geographical names.

The celestial globe contains the figures of the several constellations
exquisitely drawn, the name of each being given
in Latin, in Arabic, and in Greek. One finds on this globe
but the one short legend reading &#8220;Stella praeclara et peregrina
Anno D. 1572 et per annum et quatuor menses, scilicet
a principio Novvemb. usque ad ultimum Martii 1573.&#8221; &#8220;A
very bright and wandering star (appearing) in the year
1572 and for one year and four months, visible from the
first of November to the last of March 1573.&#8221;

Another fine pair of Moroncelli&#8217;s manuscript globes, constructed
in the year 1716, is to be found in the Biblioteca
Casanatense of Rome. They have each a diameter of about
160 cm. and are mounted on plain octagonal bases. The
terrestrial has a graduated meridian of brass, a horizon circle
of wood, likewise graduated and having indicated on its
surface the several signs of the zodiac, the names of the
months, and of the principal winds. On the surface of the
globe, the parallels and the meridians are drawn at intervals
of five degrees, the prime meridian passing through the most
western island of the Canaries. The address to the reader,
like that on the globe in the Alessandrian Library, is practically
a copy of the one to be found on the Greuter globe
of the year 1632. A lengthy legend relating to the prime
meridian reads: &#8220;Ut recta methodo ad cognitionem Geographie
deveniamus, Principium desumere a po Meridiano,
a quo longitudo habetur, debemus. Unde sic. Quamvis igitur
Longitudinis initium arbitrarium sit, ab occasu tamen ejus
auspicium facere ideo Veteribus placuit quod illic aliquis
Terre limes esset inventus qui Ortum versus nullus expeditionibus
deprehendi potuisset atque eam ob causam Ptolemeus
cujus sedulitati ac industriae Geographie incolumitatem
omnes vel inviti debent ab ultimo termino Occidentis
cognito que Insule in Atlantico mari Fortunate olim dicte
nunc Canariae vocantur auspicium fecit. In iisque Primum90
meridianum defixit quod theticum principium deinceps fere
omnes ejus auctoritate moti retinuerunt. Nunnulli quidem
Seculo transacto principium tenendum censuere ubi Acus
Magneti junctae recta in boream spectat: Sed multum inter
se dissentientes allucinantur. Nos autem Ptolomei vestigiis
insistentes easdem Insulas delegimus et Lineam meridionalem
in Insula De Ferro dicta que de Fortunatis ut olim et de
Canariis nunc, una de Principalibus est fiximus.&#8221; &#8220;That we
may come to the right method for acquiring a knowledge
of geography we must make a beginning from the first meridian
from which longitude is reckoned. Although the beginning
of longitude is arbitrary it pleased the ancients to
make this beginning from the west because there was found
a limit of the earth which could not be found by voyages
toward the east. For this reason Ptolemy, to whose application
and industry all men owe the preservation of geography
though grudgingly, made the beginning from the farthest
known bounds of the west, which are the Fortunate Islands
in the Atlantic Ocean, but now called the Canary Islands.
In these he fixed the first meridian, and this hypothetical
beginning almost all who have followed him have been led
by his authority to retain. Not a few in the century just
passed have thought that the beginning should be made
where the magnetic needle points directly to the north. But
these, as they disagree among themselves are mistaken. We
follow in the footsteps of Ptolemy and have chosen the same
island, and placed the meridian line in the Island of Ferro,
one of the principal islands of the Fortunate group now
called the Canaries.&#8221;

In addition to the one just quoted there are a few other
legends relating to geographical discoveries which contain
allusions, very similar to the many which may be found on
certain other globes of the period, adding little or nothing
that is new.

The celestial globe, mounted practically the same as the
terrestrial, contains the following legend: &#8220;Ecce damus91
methodo Ptolemaica seu Orteliana coelestium siderum quotquot
hodie extare comperimus schemata, situs et ut decet
reperiuntur perfecta. Sunt enim ex descriptionibus Hipparchi,
Ptolomei, Alphonsi, Copernici, per Tyconem Brahe ad
trutinam examinata, nec non Joannis Bayeri, qui Uranometriam
per imagines in tabulis aeneis expressit. Et nunc per
me D. Silvestrum Amantium Moroncelli Fabrianen&#772; Abbatem
Bened. Congreg. Silv. calamo descripta coloribusque
effigiata adattataque ad Ann. 1716.&#8221; &#8220;Observe that we give
after the method of Ptolemy or Ortelius the settings of the
stars of heaven, as far as they have, to the present, been discovered,
and as far as their positions have been made known.
We have employed the descriptions of Hipparchus, Ptolemy,
Alfonso, and Copernicus, as tested and confirmed by Tycho
Brahe, and also by the observations of Johannes Bayer, who
expressed the star system (of Tycho Brahe) objectively in
brass tables, now by myself D. Silvester Amantius Moroncelli
of Fabriano, Benedictine Abbot of the Silvestrin Congregation.
All these have been expressed in letters and represented
in colors, and accommodated to the year 1716.&#8221;

There is given a second legend of some importance reading,
&#8220;Tabula continens quantum quovis proposito anno vel
addendum vel demendum sit longitudini affixarum. Stellae
enim spatio septuaginta Annorum et quinque mensium unicum
gradum secondum Asterismorum ordinem super Polum
Zodiaci progrediuntur ab Occasu ad Orientem. Ex hujusmodi
Regula invenitur Sidera migrasse a Mundi creatione
usque ad hunc annum 6915, Gr. 98, M. 47, S. 20. Et ab
adventu D. N. J. C. usque ad hunc annum 1716, Gr. 24,
M. 30, S. 25.&#8221; &#8220;Table noting how much must be added to or
subtracted from the longitude of the fixed stars in any given
year. The stars move from west to east one degree in the
space of seventy years and five months according to the
order of the constellations of the zodiac. From this rule it is
found that the stars have moved from the creation of the
world a period of 6915 years to the present 98 degrees, 4792
minutes and 20 seconds, and from the advent of Our Lord
Jesus Christ to this year 1716, 24 degrees, 30 minutes, and
25 seconds.&#8221;

In addition to the above-mentioned examples of Moroncelli&#8217;s
work, there may be cited a number of allusions to
others which cannot now be located. Fiorini notes first a fine
cosmographic sphere designed to represent both the terrestrial
and the celestial, having a circumference of 2.62 palms,
and probably constructed for the patrician family Trevisiani.77
It appears that it later passed into the hands of
Prince Lucio Odescalchi of Milan, and in the year 1849
was taken to Rome, after which it appears that all trace of
it was lost. It is said to have been a very artistic piece, brilliantly
colored with numerous pictures executed in miniature,
and to have been dated 1690. The anonymous
biographer of Moroncelli, whose account exists only in manuscript
and is frequently cited by Fiorini, notes that Moroncelli
constructed a manuscript globe for Queen Christina of
Sweden.78 This has been thought by Porti to be the globe
just referred to, but the identity is doubtful. Again Fiorini
makes allusion to the probable existence at one time of a pair
of Moroncelli&#8217;s globes in the Monasterio Biblioteca of S.
Benedetto of Fabriano, and of still another pair in the Collegio
De Vecchi of the same city, but of these nothing at
present is known.79 The anonymous biography likewise
alludes to one of his celestial globes which he constructed
and dedicated to Cardinal Alessandro Albani of Urbino. In
this the author undertook, like certain others of his day, to
substitute for the Greek mythological characters or figures
representing the several constellations, pictures of biblical
objects and characters, or of individuals selected from Christian
martyrology.80 While this particular globe cannot now
be located, there is a small one of similar character which
belongs to the Accademia Etrusca of Cortona, having a
diameter of about 27 cm., its map being partly in manuscript
and partly printed. There is the following author and date
93legend: &#8220;Sacrometria omnium asterismorum coelestium figuris
Aecclesiasticis reformatorum a Rev. Abb. D. Sil. Amantio
Moroncelli Fabrianen. Silvestrino Ann. 1710.&#8221; &#8220;Sacred
measurements of all the heavenly stars expressed in ecclesiastical
notation by the Rev. D. Silvester Amantius Moroncelli
of Fabriano, a Silvestrian, in the year 1710.&#8221; A brief
descriptive legend reads, &#8220;In hac coelesti sphaera Stellae
affixae majori quam hactenus numero et accuratiori industria
delineantur novis asterismis in Philomateor&#363; gratiam de
integro additis: quae omnia secondum Astronomorum Principis
Thyconis Brahe et aliorum observationem verae suae
Longitudini ac Latitudini ad annum Christi 1636 restituta
sunt.&#8221; &#8220;In this celestial sphere the fixed stars are depicted
in greater number than previously and with more accurate
care, the new stars being added for the use of the student;
all of which, according to the observations of that Prince
of astronomers Tycho Brahe, and of others, are given with
their true latitude and longitude, and accommodated to the
year of Christ 1636.&#8221; This library of Cortona possesses a
manuscript of Moroncelli titled &#8220;Sacrometria omnium asterismorum
continens schemata figuris ecclesiasticis expressa
Silvestri Amantii Moroncelli Fabrianensis ecc. anno 1707.&#8221;
&#8220;Sacred measurement of all the stars being a scheme expressing
in ecclesiastical notation by Silvester Amantius Moroncelli
of Fabriano in the year 1707.&#8221; The constellations he
divides into three groups: the boreal from 1-19, the zodiacal
from 20-31, the southern from 32-58, giving to each a new
name. Hercules, for example, he changed to Samson; Lyra
to David; Cassiopeia to Eve; Virgo to Virgo Maria Assumpta
in Coelum. One can scarcely affirm that Moroncelli
exerted a wide-reaching influence, nevertheless he has, for
his day, a place of considerable prominence among globe
makers.

Mr. William R. Hearst of New York possesses an exceedingly
fine manuscript celestial globe which circumstances
have not left it possible to identify. He has courteously furnished94
the photograph from which it is here shown in illustration
(Fig. 106). Once belonging to Mr. Stanford White,
it probably was purchased in Italy, passing in the year 1907
into the hands of Mr. Hearst. In the sales catalogue of The
American Art Society it is referred to as a globe of the sixteenth
century. There, however, is reason for assigning it to
the latter part of the seventeenth century, as there is reason
for attributing it to the Abbot Silvester Amantius Moroncelli.
If the authorship is correctly attributed it may be
counted one of great value. The figures of the several constellations
are well colored. The mounting is of wrought
iron, with gilt ornaments. The globe itself has a diameter
of about 90 cm., while its entire height, including the tripod
base, is about 200 cm.

Roger Palmer (Fig. 107), Count of Castlemaine (1634-1705),81
published, in the year 1679, a work bearing the
title &#8216;The English globe being a stabil and immobil one,
performing what the ordinary globes do, and much more.&#8217;
In this he described a globe of his own invention, having
a diameter of about one foot. It does not appear that the
Earl especially distinguished himself in matters either
geographical or astronomical. As a diversion from his other
interests which claimed his attention, he appears to have
turned to the construction of a globe for which he claimed
an especial superiority over all others, primarily on account
of its simplicity. He set forth in his descriptive text more
than twenty of its superior features, and it is interesting to
note that Moxon thought well enough of the work to
reissue it in the year 1696.82 (Fig. 108.)

Coronelli gives us the following information concerning
a rather remarkable globe which he had occasion to examine
in the city of Augsburg, of which he made a drawing for
the Venetian Academy (Fig. 109), as he tells us, afterward
reproducing the same in his &#8216;Epitome Cosmografica.&#8217;83 This
globe he says was the invention of Christopher Treffler of
Augsburg and was constructed by Christopher Rad, jeweler
95to His Majesty the Emperor, in the year 1683. He calls it an
&#8220;Automaton Sphaeridicum,&#8221; that is, a celestial globe provided
with an automatic movement, so contrived as to exhibit
accurately the course of the stars, and to indicate the
years, months, days, hours, and minutes, together with the
eclipses for seventeen years in advance. At the top of the
instrument was placed a little sphere by means of which one
could represent certain celestial phenomena, past and
future. This mechanism, says Coronelli, is ornamented with96
great ingenuity, good taste, and all regardless of expense.
In its construction eighteen hundred ounces of gold and
silver had been used. Its height was seven feet, and at the
bottom it measured four feet, the entire work rising in the
manner of a pyramid above its support of four artistically
designed figures. This globe, says Coronelli, which we have
seen and handled, and of which we have an exceedingly high
opinion, was for sale at eight thousand thaler, and had been
fully described in a duodecimo volume printed by the House
of Koppmeyer, in the year 1683.84 It is not known what
became of this globe which Coronelli found to be so worthy
of his commendation.

The Atheneo of Brescia possesses an armillary sphere,
having on one of its armillae an inscription which tells us
that it was constructed by Gian Battista Alberti in the year
1688, for Count Martinengo.85 The graduated horizon circle,
on which appear the names of the sixteen principal winds
or directions, rests upon two semicircles, which in turn rest
on a support of brass ornamented by six allegorical figures.
In this supporting base there has been placed a compass. Its
graduated hour circle is furnished with a movable index,
such as had become common in globe construction. Five
prominent circles represent the equator, the tropics, and the
polar circles, to which is added a zodiacal band which is
graduated and bears the names and the symbolical figures of
the twelve constellations, and the names of the months. Two
rings for the purpose of indicating celestial latitude and
longitude are placed within the above-named circles and
carry representations of the sun and the moon.

A contemporary of Alberti, Giovanni Maccari of Mirandola,
likewise a maker of armillary spheres, is known to us
through one only, but a fine example of his work.86 This
sphere belongs to the Liceo Spallanzi of Regio Emilia. The
meridian circle, having a diameter of about 16 cm., is graduated
both for latitude and co-latitude by fives. Adjusted
to this meridian is a circle representing the colures,
likewise97
graduated both for latitude and co-latitude, but by tens, and
adjusted to these are the polar circles, the tropics, and the
equator. On the zodiacal circle are engraved the names of the
twelve constellations, the names of the days, and on the
inner surface the inscription &#8220;Joannes Maccarius Mirandulanus
Feccit 1689.&#8221; The supporting base is triangular in
shape, having a compass placed in the center. Within the
three angles of this base shields have been placed, the one
bearing the inscription &#8220;Anno Domini 1689,&#8221; the second
the name &#8220;Jo Vulpis Mirandulanus Domus,&#8221; by whom the
work was probably ordered; the third has a representation of
a fox, the emblem of the Volpi family. In addition to the
above the base is ornamented with a bronze scroll, to the
points of which are attached semicircles which support the
horizon circle. This circle has a diameter of about 15 cm.,
on which are engraved the usual zodiacal names and signs,
the names of the months, and of the principal winds or directions.
An hour circle is placed at the south pole with a movable
index, and within, at the common center of the circles,
a small sphere to represent the terrestrial globe, through
which the polar axis is made to pass.

In the Biblioteca Estense of Modena there may be found
three armillary spheres apparently of about the same date as
the two just described.87 One of the three bears the inscription
&#8220;Jos Antus Vulpes Mirandula Domin. anno Domini
1689.&#8221; The other two, somewhat larger in size than the preceding,
give us no particular indication of the maker, and
no exact date of construction. They may be the work of
Alberti or of Maccari.

In Italy&#8217;s long line of illustrious geographers, cartographers,
and globe makers none has rank in advance of P.
Vincenzo Maria Coronelli (1650-1718).88 His achievements
within his field were prodigious.89 While, as noted above,
there is wanting the evidence that his influence was extended
in striking manner into transalpine countries, he seems at
least to have won the enthusiastic recognition of contemporary98
men of science, as one worthy of honor for his great
achievements.

He was a native of Ravenna (Fig. 110), a member of
the Franciscan Order of monks, serving in the last years
of his life as its general. It was in his young manhood
that he went to Venice, which city became the scene of the
greater part of his literary and scientific activities.

More than four hundred maps were drawn, engraved,
and printed by him in the Franciscan Convent located on
one of the Venetian islands, and known as the Gran Casa
del Frari, where he lived with other brothers of the Order.
It was in this convent that Coronelli founded, in the year
1680, the first geographical society, to which he gave the
name Accademia Cosmografo degli Argonauti,90 which in
its organization followed somewhat that of certain other
learned societies owing their origin to the literary and scientific
activities of the renaissance period. Its membership, in
the course of years, included men of distinction in other
cities of Italy and in the North; men famous for their
achievements and for their interest in geographical science,
literary men, men who held high rank in Europe&#8217;s aristocracy,
cardinals, prelates, princes, and monarchs.91 The society
became one of the most active of the period, and the list
of publications which issued from its press, each bearing
the argonautic emblem or device&mdash;a ship on a terrestrial
globe with the motto &#8220;Plus Ultra&#8221; (Fig. 111)&mdash;is a long
one.92

degli Argonauti.

So great had become the fame of Coronelli as early as the
year 1685, that he was honored with the title Cosmografo
della Serenissima Republica, and was granted an annual
allowance of four hundred florins, and a copyright privilege
protecting him in his right to print and publish any of his
works for a period of twenty-five years.93

We have no definite information as to the circumstances
attending Coronelli&#8217;s first interest in globe construction. It
appears that his first work in this line, a pair of large manuscript99
globes, opened immediately to him a path to fame,
for these had come to adorn the library of the Duke of
Parma to whom the French Cardinal, d&#8217;Estr&eacute;es, in the year
1680 had occasion to pay a visit and they immediately won
the cardinal&#8217;s interest. A pair of such globes, thought he,
for so runs the story, would be a source of great delight to
His Majesty the French King, Louis XIV. Learning that
the construction of still larger globes was altogether possible,
but that their removal from Italy to France would be
attended with great difficulty, he persuaded Coronelli to
accept an invitation to take up a residence in Paris, there
to direct the construction of a terrestrial and a celestial
globe, sparing neither labor nor expense that they might be
worthy of presentation to the Grand Monarch. If Olearius
could construct a globe ten feet and more in diameter for
Duke Frederick of Holstein, and Weigel one of similar dimensions
for the demonstration of his theories, why, thought
Coronelli, should I not undertake the preparation of those
at least fifteen feet in diameter, which in all the details of
globe construction should be made to surpass any that had
hitherto been conceived? The author himself has given us
the first though brief description of his completed work,94
and the royal astronomer, La Hire, supplemented this description
in his little volume published in the year 1704,
when the globes had been placed in the Chateau Marly.95
In the author&#8217;s own account he alludes to the globes as
having been constructed at Paris under his direction, and
by order of the Most Eminent Cardinal d&#8217;Estr&eacute;es, for the
service of His Most Christian Majesty. Great care was especially
exercised in the construction of the machinery designed
for the rotation of the spheres, the author being especially
proud of the fact that, so delicate was this mechanism, each
could be set in motion by a single finger. He further gives us
to understand that each sphere was so well fashioned &#8220;one
could design upon its surface all the degrees in the manner
in which a turner designs any circle on a ball without having100
it removed from the turner&#8217;s lathe,&#8221; and that the material
of which they were constructed was so solid and so well
joined that each was able to sustain the weight of thirty
men. Each was furnished with a door through which a considerable
number of persons might enter at one time, their
presence within affecting in no wise the solidity of construction.
Each was covered with fine canvas so carefully laid
on that none of the joints could be seen, giving a surface
smooth as ivory. The meridian and horizon circles were of
bronze, the whole being supported by columns which were
richly ornamented. In the base, between the four columns
supporting the meridian circles, large compasses were placed,
being so designed as properly to indicate the needle&#8217;s
declination.

On the celestial globe the greater and the lesser circles
were represented in gilt bronze, and were so graduated for
both latitude and longitude, ascension and declination, that
it was made easy for an astronomer to pass from one co-ordinate
to the other without the aid of trigonometry. On a
fine background of ultramarine the several constellations
with their respective figures were represented, each of the
planets and fixed stars being gilded in order to give it due
prominence. The author so designed his star map as to represent
the appearance of the heavens at the time of the birth
of the Grand Monarch,96 as is told in the following dedication
engraved on a brass tablet and attached to the surface of
the sphere: &#8220;A l&#8217;Auguste Majest&eacute; de Louis le Grand l&#8217;Invincible,
l&#8217;Heureux, le Sage, le Conquerant. Cesar Cardinal
d&#8217;Estr&eacute;es a consacr&eacute; ce globe celeste, ou toutes les etoilles
du firmament, et les planetes sont plac&eacute;es au lieu mesme, ou
elles estoient a la naissance de ce Glorieux Monarque, afin
de conserver a l&#8217;eternite une image fixe de cette heureuse
disposition, sous laquelle la France a receu le plus grand
present, que le ciel ait iamais fait a la terre. M.DC.LXXXIII.&#8221;
&#8220;To His August Majesty Louis the Great, the
Invincible, the Happy, the Wise, the Conquering. Cesar
101Cardinal d&#8217;Estr&eacute;es has dedicated this celestial globe, on
which all the stars of heaven and the planets are placed in
the same position in which they were at the birth of the
Glorious Monarch, in order to preserve throughout eternity
a fixed image of that happy disposition under which France
has received the most noble present which Heaven has ever
made to earth.&#8221;

On the terrestrial globe, which in its general features resembled
the celestial, the seas were painted blue and the
land white, that the several names and legends might appear
the more distinct. A portrait of the King was placed above
a cartouch containing the dedication, resembling that on the
celestial globe, reading &#8220;A l&#8217;Auguste Majeste de Louis le
Grand l&#8217;Invincible, l&#8217;Heureux, le Sage, le Conquerant. Cesar
Cardinal d&#8217;Estr&eacute;es a consacr&eacute; ce globe terrestre, pour rendre
un continuel hommage a sa Glore, et a ses Heroiques Vertus,
en mostrant les pays ou mille grandes Actions ont est&eacute;
execut&eacute;es et par Luy Mesme, et par ses Ordres, a l&#8217;estonnement
de tant de nations, qu&#8217;il avroit pu soumetre a son empire,
si sa Moderation n&#8217;eust arrest&egrave; le Cours de Ses Conquestes,
et prescrit des bornes a Sa Valeur, plus grande encore
que sa Fortune. M.DC.LXXXIII.&#8221; &#8220;To His August Majesty
Louis the Great, the Invincible, the Happy, the Wise,
the conquering. Cesar Cardinal d&#8217;Estr&eacute;es has dedicated this
terrestrial globe, in order to render perpetual homage to His
Glory and to His Heroic Virtue in representing the countries
wherein a thousand great acts have been performed
both by Himself and by his Order, to the astonishment of all
nations, which He would have been able to bring under his
subjection if his moderation had not restrained the course
of his Conquests and prescribed bounds to his Courage yet
greater than his Fortune. M.DC.LXXXIII.&#8221;

Below this dedication, likewise below the corresponding
dedication on the celestial globe, we read &#8220;Cet ouvrage a
et&eacute; invent&eacute; et achev&eacute; par le P&egrave;re Coronelli Venitien des.102
Min. Conv.&#8221; &#8220;This work was conceived and accomplished
by P. Coronelli, a Venetian of the Minorite Order.&#8221;

In his brief description, the author says that he has shown
on his terrestrial globe all ancient and modern discoveries,
basing the same on the maps, the observations, and the reports
of the most renowned geographers, to which he has
added the results of his own studies not recorded on other
globes nor in other maps. Special mention is made of information
given concerning the interior regions of Africa, noting
that &#8220;besides outlining the Monomotapa and Abyssinia
countries, we have been the first to describe correctly the
source as well as the course of the Nile River correcting, by
many degrees the errors of the ancients.&#8221; Andrea Baba, public
censor and secretary of the Argonauts, notes, in his letter
to the reader appearing in the first volume of the &#8216;Atlante
Veneto,&#8217; that the author of the two globes, constructed for
the King of France, had obtained numerous authentic reports
of geographers and explorers, which he had included
in his work. Ludolf, writing in the year 1691 concerning
Ethiopia, records &#8220;Ethiopia: Nostram tabulam chorographicam
comunicavimus cum P. Vincentio Coronellio, nunc
cosmographo Veneto, qui eam adhibuit in globis quos Cardinalis
Estresius pro rege Galliae construi fecit, maximos,
qui unquam visi fuerint. Ibi in Globo terrestri Habessina et
Nilus secundum nostram delineationem visitur. Satis mature
eam communicaverim Adamo Oleario, cum insignem
globum, qui Gottorfii cernitur, construeret, sed ille mihi, ut
tum temporis juveni, fidem non habuit.&#8221; &#8220;Ethiopia: we
made known our chorographic record to P. Vincentio Coronelli
now cosmographer of Venice, who included it on his
globe which Cardinal d&#8217;Estr&eacute;es had made for the King of
France, the largest globe ever seen. There, on the terrestrial
globe, Abyssinia and the Nile are seen following our representation.
Quite a long time ago we made this known to
Adam Olearius, when he was making the renowned globe103
which may be seen at Gottorp, but he, as I was then a young
man, did not have confidence in me.&#8221;97

Marcel, in writing of the Portuguese in Africa, observed:
&#8220;Si nous examinons les cartes de Mercator, de Bertius, de
Hondius, de Meursius, de Sanson, de Duval, nous y trouvons
un cours du Cuama ou Zanb&egrave;si absolument fantaisiste.
Il faut arriver au fameux globe de Coronelli pour y trouver
en 1683 le cours de Zamb&egrave;se trac&eacute; comme sur la carte que
nous reproduisons. Il est &eacute;vident que ce g&eacute;ographe v&eacute;nitien
a pu consulter des documents portugais aujourd&#8217;hui perdus,
cartes ou relations de voyages, qui viendraient jeter un jour
infiniment pr&eacute;cieux sur les explorations des Portugais et les
relations qu&#8217;ils entretenaient avec les populations belliqueuses
du bassin du Chir&eacute;.&#8221; &#8220;If we examine the maps of
Mercator, of Bertius, Hondius, Meureius, Sanson, Duval,
we will find the course of the Cuama or Zambesi absolutely
fantastic. One must examine the famous globe of Coronelli
to find in 1683 the course of the Zambesi represented as on
the map which we reproduce. It is evident that the Venetian
geographer had been able to consult Portuguese documents
which today are lost, maps or accounts of Voyages which
would throw light of great value on the explorations of the
Portuguese and the relations they had with the warlike
people of the basin of the Chir&eacute;.&#8221;98

Coronelli adorned his globe map with very artistic representations
of merchant ships sailing over the ocean highways,
and with elaborate pictures of many naval battles.

It was in the year 1704 that these globes were placed in
the royal Ch&acirc;teau Marly,99 where they remained until the
year 1722, when they were placed in the old Palace of the
Louvre. A final resting place was found for them in the
Royal Library, now known as the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, in
a room especially constructed to receive them. Recent information
from the library notes that, on account of certain
reconstructive work, they have been placed in an inaccessible
part of the building, and cannot be photographed.

104The success of this first endeavor to construct globes of
large size led other Princes to entertain the thought of
adorning their palaces with similar productions. It is not
known, however, that the great Venetian actually set himself
to the task of duplicating his French masterpieces;
we have rather the assurance, as is noted below, that he
thought better of a plan for issuing globes of smaller size,
whose map records should contain practically all he had
been able to include in his large work. The Royal Estense
Library of Modena possesses a manuscript, cited by Fiorini,
which assures us that Coronelli had been approached with
a proposition to construct for Francis II of Modena a pair
of globes equal in size to those he had prepared for the
French King. This document reads: &#8220;Rispondendo il P.r&#772;e
Cosmografo Coronelli alii di lei questiti per la fabbrica delli
globi, gli dice, che il far&agrave; tanto grandi, quanta sar&agrave; la capacit&agrave;
della stanza, e bisognando fabbricare anco una stanza
dentro del Globo, resta solo che il Principe che la desidera,
habbia curiosit&agrave; e volont&agrave; do spendere; limitandosi per&ograve; il
P. Cosmografo alia grandezza di Globi di diametro di quindici
piedi, dice, che per il solo pagamento di materiali, e
degli Artifici, si ricercano ducento doppie; che per delineare
la Geografia, scriveri, collocarvi le stelle, ed assegnare il
luogo alle figure vi vorr&agrave; di spesa quattrocento doppie. Per
accomodare il luogo che sia capace per la fabrica delli Globi
di questa grandezza, vi vogliono cinquanta doppie. Per gli
ornamenti della Pittura, Miniatura, Scultura, et altri, si
potr&agrave; fare quella spesa che parer&agrave; pi&ugrave; propria al Principe,
che desidera; mentre in questi si pu&ograve; o meno. E perch&egrave; il
Principe conosca il genio dell&#8217; autore in questa materia,
osserver&agrave; nella picciolezza delle due mostre, ch&#8217;esibisce, confrontandole
colle migliori carte, di qual perfetione e pulizia
sarebbe questa di quindici piedi. Il P. Coronelli per ricompensa
desidera una pensione annua sua vita durante di quella
soma che parer&agrave; propria alia generosit&agrave; del Principe.
S&#8217;aggiunge, un quinternetto della supputazione delle stelle105
d&#8217;Orione, perch&egrave; il Principe osservi l&#8217;accrescimento delle
stelle di questa costellazione, come sono accresciute di gran
numero tutte le altro del Globo del Cielo del P. Coronelli.&#8221;
&#8220;Father Coronelli, in reply to your questions regarding the
construction of the globes which you say you wish to have
made as large as the capacity of the room will allow, and
with space in the globe itself, says that all that is necessary
is to know how much his Excellency the Prince should wish
to expend. However Father Coronelli limits himself to the
construction of globes of fifteen feet in diameter, for which
the cost of the material alone and of the workmanship is two
hundred doubloons. For outlining the geographical map,
for the proper placing of the stars, and the representation
of the figures, the cost will be four hundred doubloons. To
arrange a place for globes of this size another fifty doubloons
will be necessary. For the decorations, the miniatures and
engravings His Excellency can spend as much as he desires.
In order that His Excellency the Prince may appreciate the
great genius of the author in this matter, he will please take
note of the two small globes which he exhibits, (and think)
how perfect and attractive those fifteen feet in diameter will
be in comparison with the best of maps. Father Coronelli
desires, as compensation, an annual pension for life, such
sum as His Excellency the Prince considers sufficiently
generous. We enclose an account showing the representation
of the stars of Orion, in order that the Prince may note the
increase in the number of the stars in this constellation, and
also note how all of the other constellations as represented
on the globe of Father Coronelli show an increase in the
number of stars.&#8221;100 There is no evidence known that this
work was actually undertaken by our Venetian globe maker,
the presumption being that the matter did not receive further
consideration.

As an expression of appreciation for the honors shown to
him by the Academy of the Argonauts, Coronelli decided to
issue his Paris globes reduced in size, choosing a diameter of106
three and one half feet or about 107 cm. instead of fifteen
feet. His globes, therefore, of the year 1688 were the largest
to date in which engraved gore maps had been employed in
construction. In one of his legends he thus alludes to the
Academy. &#8220;Il genio della virt&ugrave; raccomanda all&#8217;eternit&agrave; il
nome di Cesare Cardinale eminentissimo d&#8217;Estr&eacute;es, Duca e
Pari Francia, mentre fece elaborare per Ludovico il Magno
dal P. Coronelli due gran Globi l&#8217;idea dei quali ha poi
epilogata in questi per l&#8217;Accademia cosmografica degli Argonauti.
L&#8217;anno MDCLXXXVIII.&#8221; &#8220;The genius of virtue
commends to posterity the name of Cesar, most eminent
Cardinal d&#8217;Estr&eacute;es, Duke and Peer of France, since he had
constructed for Louis the Great by P. Coronelli two large
globes, the idea of which he then summarized herewith for
the Cosmographical Academy of the Argonauts. In the year
1688.&#8221; The dedication, the same as that on the celestial
globe, reads as follows: &#8220;Alla Serenissima Republica e
Serinissimo Principe Francesco Morosini Doge di Venezia

and the Most Serene Prince Francesco Morosini, Doge of
Venice, Captain General of the Sea, by Vincenzo Coronelli
M. C., the above mentioned cosmographer and public
reader.&#8221; Placed below this legend in a cartouch containing
the portrait of the author is the inscription &#8220;P. V. Coronelli
M. C. Cosmografo Publico.&#8221; There is an inscription on the
celestial globe which reads, &#8220;Si presentano a V. Serenit&agrave; li

remarkable deeds of Princes, in order that while the thirteenth
century is passing (which makes nearly a fourth part
of the life of the world) wherein the Most Serene Republic
has proceeded equally with the splendor of letters and the
brilliancy of arms may be seen by the universality of the
races; by means of this so important publication however
there is more widely spread the glory of the Venetian name;
of which glory a portion is assumed by the Cosmographical
Academy of the Argonauts, in the present dedication, and
by him who lives by our permission, Coronelli, Cosmographer
of the same.&#8221;

The author selected the year 1700 as that in which to
indicate the position of the stars which he represented on his
globe, referring to this fact in his legend. &#8220;L&#8217;epoca di questo
globo &egrave; perfissa nell&#8217;anno futuro 1700 acciocch&egrave; l&#8217;arte in
quest&#8217; opera precorra quel tempo che per natura dovr&agrave; consumarla.
Prevenendo questo globo tardo il Corso veloce del
Cielo, comparisce presente il secolo venturo acci&ograve; possi
ognuno con ordine pi&ugrave; facile ridurre agli anni scorsi le stelle
fisse colla sottrazione di 51 secondi come piace a Ticone, o
50 seguendo il parere del Ricciolo. Volendo specolare il
sistema degli anni anco posteriore all&#8217;epoca stabilita, aggiungasi
proporzionalmente al 1700 che seguir&agrave; la riduttione
senza errore sensibile per tutto lo spazio di 400 anni.&#8221;
&#8220;The epoch of this globe is fixed for the year 1700, in order
that the labor in its construction may have the time which
naturally will be required for its completion. As this belated
globe anticipates the rapid movement of the sky, the coming
century appears as though present, anyone may be able in
easier fashion to change to past years the fixed stars, by the
subtraction of fifty-one seconds as Tycho reckons, or fifty
according to the opinion of Ricciola. If one desires to speculate
also upon the system of the years posterior to the established
epoch, let him add proportionally to 1700, and the108
change will follow without sensible error for the entire
period of 400 years.&#8221;

To the constellations he makes the following reference:
&#8220;Furono osservate molte stelle in vicinanza del Polo antartico
incognite non solo agli Egizij e Greci, ma ancora a
Ticone Brahe. Osserv&ograve; parimente Federico Houtmano, nell&#8217;Isola
Sumatra, molte stelle vicine al Polo medesimo, le quali
essendo state incognite agli accinnati autori, le ridussero in
13 costellazioni cio&egrave; Fenice Colomb Mosca, Pesce volante,
Camaleonte, Triangolo Australe, Uccello Indiano, Pavone,
l&#8217;Uomo Indiano, la Gru, il Toucan, l&#8217;Hindro e il dorado;
altri dopo v&#8217;hanno aggiunto la Nube Grande, la Picciola e
la Romboide. Noi abbiamo arricchito questo Globo d&#8217;un
maggior numero di stelle, scoperte dall&#8217; Hallei Inglese, che
si trasport&ograve; a tal effetto nell&#8217;Isola S. Elena, coll&#8217;aggiunta
d&#8217;altre osservatione, cos&igrave; do questo come d&#8217;altri scritton.&#8221;
&#8220;There have been observed many stars in the vicinity of the
Antarctic pole, unknown not only to the Egyptians and
Greeks, but also to Tycho Brahe. There have been observed
likewise by Frederick Houtmann, on the Island of Sumatra,
many stars near the same pole which having been unknown
to the above-mentioned authors, they reduced to 13 constellations,
namely the Phoenix, the Dove, the Fly, the Flying
Fish, the Chameleon, the Southern Triangle, the Indian
Bird, the Peacock, the Indian Man, the Crane, the Toucan,
the Water-Snake, and the Goldfish; others since then have
been added to these, the Greater Cloud and the Lesser, and
the Rhomboid. We have enriched this globe with a considerable
number of stars discovered by the Englishman Halley,
who was sent to the Island of St. Helena for this
purpose, with the addition of other observations as they
have written.&#8221;

Thirty-eight constellations are designated in the northern
hemisphere, twelve in the zodiac, and thirty-three in the
southern hemisphere, thus adding thirty-five to the number
as given by Ptolemy. Instead of Ptolemy&#8217;s 1022 catalogued109
stars, including fifteen of the first magnitude, forty-five of
the second, two hundred and eight of the third, four hundred
and seventy-four of the fourth, two hundred and seventeen
of the fifth, forty-nine of the sixth, and forty which
were nebular and indistinct, Coronelli gives the number as
1902, including eighteen of the first, sixty-eight of the second,
two hundred and thirty-seven of the third, four hundred
and ninety-six of the fourth, four hundred and eighty-nine
of the fifth, five hundred and sixteen of the sixth, and
seventy-eight which were nebular and indistinct. Five of the
latter, having been discovered in the previous one hundred
and twenty-five years, had wholly or in part disappeared
in Coronelli&#8217;s day, of which, that making its appearance in
the constellation Cassiopeia in the year 1572 disappeared
in the year 1574, that discovered in the year 1596 in the
Whale was rapidly diminishing in size, that discovered by
Tycho Brahe in the Swan in the year 1600 ceased to be
visible in the year 1629 to reappear in the year 1659, that
in the Serpent larger than the planet Jupiter which was
visible but thirteen months, that in the head of the Swan
discovered in the year 1670 and still visible.

Coronelli seems to have made every endeavor to produce
maps for his terrestrial globes which should omit nothing of
real interest and value to geographers, navigators, and explorers.
He added a rather unusual number of legends, explanatory
and informative in character, but never seemed to
crowd the space which he had at his disposal. So exquisitely
engraved were his maps that he was able to avoid the appearance
of confusion noticeable on certain other globes of his
century, as, for example, in the Old World parts of Blaeu&#8217;s
globe of 1622. It is very evident that many pages would be
required for anything like a detailed description of his
records, and the great majority must necessarily be omitted.
To those quoted above a few, however, may be added.

Blaeu&#8217;s reference to the prime meridian was cited in full
as was that of Moroncelli; Coronelli&#8217;s reference is here like110wise
cited, which, it will be noted, is not without errors. It
is one having to do with problems concerning the determination
of longitude, hence involving interests of vital concern
to navigation. &#8220;Del primo meridiano. Sono in questo 72
meridiani, 36 con linee continuate, le altre sono di punti, da
ciascuno dei quali &egrave; diviso in G. 5 di longitudine che &egrave; il
corso del Sole in un terzo d&#8217;oro. Li Geografi antichi e moderni
non convengono nel luogo dove passa il primo meridiano;
tra li primi Eratostene l&#8217;ha posto alle Colonne d&#8217;Hercole,
Marino di Tyr all&#8217;Isole Fortunate, Tolomeo nella
sua Geografia ha seguito la stessa opinione; ma ne&#8217; suoi libri
di Astronomia l&#8217; ha passato per Alessandria d&#8217;Egitto. Tra
li moderni Ismaele Abulfeda lo segna a Cadiz, Alfonzo a
Toledo, Pigafetta et Herrera hanno fatto il medisimo; Copernico
lo pone a Freudenburgo; Renoldo a Monte Reale o
Konisberg; Keplero a Uraniburgo; Longo Montano a
Kopenhagen; Lansbergius a Goes; Ricciolo a Bologna. Gli
Atlanti di Jansonio e di Blaeu a Monte Pico. Per continuare
l&#8217;origine della mia Geografia ho posto in questo Globo il
primo meridiano nella parte pi&ugrave; occidentale della Isola di
Ferro, com&#8217;onche per seguire il Decreto di Luigi XIII, che
col consiglio de&#8217; Geog. nel 1634 lo determin&ograve; in questo stesso
luogo.&#8221; &#8220;Concerning the first meridian. There are represented
on this 72 meridians, 36 with continuous lines&mdash;the
others are marked,&mdash;by each of which it is divided into 5 degrees
of longitude, which is the course of the sun in one third
of an hour. The ancient and modern geographers do not
agree upon the place through which the first meridian passes:
among the former, Eratosthenes put it at the Pillars of
Hercules; Marinus of Tyre at the Canary Islands; Ptolemy
in his geography has followed the same opinion, but in his
books on astronomy he has located it as running through
Alexandria in Egypt. Among the moderns, Ismail Aboulfeda
puts it at Cadiz; Alfonso at Toledo; Pigafetta and Herrera
have done the same; Copernicus puts it at Freudenberg;
Reinhold at Mount Royal (K&ouml;nigsberg); Kepler at Uranienburg;111
Longomontanus at Copenhagen; Lansberg at
Goa; Ricciola at Bologna; the atlases of Jansson and Blaeu
at Mount Pico. To continue the precedent of my geography
I have on this globe placed the first meridian in the most
western part of the Island of Ferro,&mdash;as also to follow the
decree of Louis XIII, who on the advice of the geographers
in 1634 assigned it to this same place.&#8221; California he lays
down as an island, west of which is a legend relating to
&#8220;Nuova Albione,&#8221; and north in the Pacific one relating to
&#8220;Stretto di Anian.&#8221; There is reference to the route to Goa,
which is placed near the Island of Madagascar. The reference
to the Zambesi River clearly gives evidence of acquaintance
with Portuguese records of which we have no other
knowledge. This legend reads, &#8220;Rio Zambese: Citt&agrave; e fortezza
di Tete de Portugal; Fortezza di S. Estevao; Minere
di Ferro; Minere d&#8217;argento che il Re di Monom. promise al
Re di Spagna nel 1604; Fortezza di Chicova.&#8221; &#8220;Zambesi
River: City and fortress of Tete of Portugal; fortress of
S. Estevao; iron mines; silver mines which the King of
Monomotapa promised to the King of Spain in 1604; fortress
of Chicova.&#8221; Like the other leading map makers of the
period he has indicated the course of certain transoceanic
expeditions, occasionally noting the distance sailed on each
successive day, with other valuable and interesting information
relating to the position of the sun and the moon, to
atmospheric conditions, to the appearance of sea birds and
of certain marine animals.

Globes of this 1688 edition may be found in the Biblioteca
Comunale of Fano; in the Biblioteca Comunale of
Faenza; in the K&ouml;nigliche Mathematisch-Physikalischer
Salon of Dresden, celestial undated; in the Biblioteca Civico
of Bergamo; in the Biblioteca Gonzaga of Mantua; in the
Biblioteca Marciana of Venice (Figs. 112, 113); in the
Museo Civico of Venice; in the Biblioteca Universitario of
Naples; in the Palazzo Manin of Passeriano. The twelve
gores of the terrestrial globe may be found in the British112
Museum; a fine copy of the twelve gores may also be found
in the Library of Congress, Washington; a copy of the
mounted terrestrial globe belongs to the Biblioteca Emanuele
of Rome; three copies of this globe in addition to the
pair referred to above belong to the Museo Civico of Venice.

Fig. 113. Celestial Globe of P. Vincenzo Coronelli, 1688.

It appears that Coronelli&#8217;s terrestrial globe gores of the
year 1688, which were frequently reissued, were but little
altered in the several editions. His celestial globe in successive
issues seems to have been much altered. France had
specially honored the Venetian globe maker in giving to him
every facility for the production of his great masterpieces,
the Marly globes. The Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Gallica of Paris decided, in
the year 1693, to add to his honors, and to give expression to
an appreciation of his merits through the publication of a
new edition of his globes, at least of the celestial, the Venetian
terrestrial of 1688 being made to serve as a companion.
In the following legend we have information concerning
the date, and concerning the participants in its preparation:
&#8220;Orbis coelesti typus. Opus a Coronelli Serenissimae Reipublicae
Cosmographo inchoatum Societatis Gallicae sumptibus
absolutum, Lutetiae Parisiorum. Anno N. S. MDCXCIII.
Delin. Arnoldus Deuvez Regiae Acad. Pictor;
Sculp. I. B. Nolin Reg. Chr. Calcographus.&#8221; &#8220;Representation
of a celestial globe. A work begun by Coronelli, the cosmographer
of the Venetian Republic; finished at the expense
of the French Society at Paris in the year 1693. Drawn by
Arnold Deuvez painter of the Royal Academy; I. B. Nolin
Royal Cartographer, draughtsman.&#8221;

The Parisian Society did not find it necessary to substitute
the French language in the legends for the language of the
author, as appears in the address to the reader, which of
course is not Coronelli phrasing. &#8220;Amico lettore. Rappresenta
questa Globo le Costellazioni del Firmamento, quali
agli occhi nostri compariscono e non come negli altri esposte,
poich&egrave; nel centro loro bisogna immaginarsi d&#8217;essore per
intenderle. Le stelle d&#8217;esso calcolate all&#8217;Epoca 1700 sono
113pubblicati. Quelle comprese dalle Costellazioni di Baiero,
come le pi&ugrave; cognite, perch&egrave; con maggiore facilit&agrave; si possino
colle nostre confrontare, sono accompagnate cogli caratteri
greci e latini da es so usati. Le stelle, ch&#8217; appresso Baiero, restano
informi, sono, da noi segnate di giallo; le Nuove colorite
di minio; le osservate dal P. Antelmo di verde, quelle dell&#8217;
Hallei di pavonazzo, l&#8217;altre di Hevelio di lacca; le corrette
da Baiero di Cinabro, e l&#8217;osservazioni fatte dagli altri
autori si distinguono nel nostro Epitome Cosmografico, stampato
in Venetia nel 1693. In questo pure vengono dilucidati
gli Numeri, Caratteri, le Frezze, che passano diametralmente
per le stelle, la loro Obliquit&agrave;, Lunghezza, l&#8217;Acume, gli
Pianeti che l&#8217;accompagnano; il moto diario delle Comete,
disegnate di molti secoli, ed ogni altro perticolare che per
l&#8217;angustia del sito non &egrave; permesso esprimere senza il di cui
libra non possono avere uso gli Globi presenti che pure
restano descritti nel nostro Atlante Veneto non per&ograve; cos&igrave;
diffusamente.&#8221; &#8220;Dear reader. This globe represents the constellations
of the firmament as they appear to our eyes and
not as shown by others, since it is necessary to imagine that
one is in their center in order to conceive them. The stars
of the globe are represented as calculated for the year 1700.
Those included in the constellations of Bayer, as the best
known, in order that they, with greater ease may be compared
with ours, are designated by the Greek and Latin
characters used by him. Stars, which according to Bayer
remain undetermined, are indicated by us as yellow; the new
ones colored with red; those observed by P. Antelmo, with
green, those of Halley with violet, the others of Hevelius
with lake color; the stars corrected by Bayer with cinnabar;
and the observations made by other authors are distinguished
in our Cosmographical Epitome, printed in Venice in 1693.
In this also are elucidated the numbers, characters, the lines
that pass diametrically through the stars, their obliquity,
length, extremity, the planets that accompany them, the
daily movement of the comets, traced for many centuries,
114and every other particular which because of the limitations
of space it is not here permitted to express,&mdash;without which
book it is not possible to make use of the present globes,
which are also described in our Venetian Atlas, but not so
detailed.&#8221;

Pairs of his globes are very numerous which include the
terrestrial of the year 1688, now and then with some modifications,
and the celestial of the year 1693, these being
usually, but not in all instances dated, the latter being the
Paris issue or apparently a slightly modified Venetian edition
of the same. It must be admitted that it is not easy to
classify the copies of his globes which followed his first
issue of the year 1688, but which have the same dimensions.
In not a few of these provision was made for a special dedication,
the cartouch for such dedication being often left
blank, to be filled when occasion seemed to offer for the bestowal
of the special honor. Some of these globes containing
such special dedication are known, to which reference is
made below.

Examples of Coronelli&#8217;s work belonging to this group may
be found in the following libraries or museums: In the
Landesmuseum of Z&uuml;rich (Fig. 114); in the Seminario Vescovile
of Aversa; in the Biblioteca Comunale of Bologna;
in the Archivo di Stato of Bologna; in the Biblioteca Privato
of Professor Liuzzi of Bologna; in the Convento dell&#8217; Osservanza
of Bologna; in the Museo di Strumenti Antichi of
Florence; in the Museo Civico of Genoa; a copy of the
celestial in the British Museum of London; in the Biblioteca
Brancacciana of Naples; in the Biblioteca Nazionale
of Naples; in the Biblioteca Nazionale of Palermo;
in the Biblioteca Antoniana of Padua; in the Biblioth&egrave;que
Nationale of Paris; in the Biblioteca Classense of Ravenna;
in the Biblioteca Lancisiana of Rome; in the Accademia
delle Scienze of Turin; in the Seminario Patriarcale of
Venice; in the Biblioteca Comunale of Vicenza; of the terrestrial
in the Royal Library of Madrid. The Vicenza examples,115
also those in the Archivo di Stato of Bologna and in
the Biblioteca Nazionale of Palermo, are dedicated to the
&#8220;Eminentissimo e reverendissimo Principe&#8221; Cardinal Pietro
Ottoboni. The interesting brief legend, reading &#8220;Alexander
a Via Veronensis sculpsit&#8221; on the celestial globe, gives us
clearly to understand that there were Venetian issues of that
edition which made its first appearance in Paris under the
auspices of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Gallica. The gores of this issue
Coronelli printed in his &#8216;Atlante Veneto,&#8217; Volume XI.

Fig. 114. Terrestrial Globe of P. Vincenzo Coronelli, 1688.

In the year 1696 Coronelli made an extensive European
tour which carried him as far as England, an account of
which he published in Venice in the following year under
the title &#8216;Viaggio de Venezia fino in Inghilterra.&#8217; In this
work the author describes an edition of his globes which he
referred to as having a diameter of &#8220;un piede e mezzo,&#8221; or
about 48 cm., prepared in London and dedicated to the
English King William III, of which it has been possible to
locate several examples. A particularly fine copy of the terrestrial
may be found in the collection of The Hispanic
Society of America (Fig. 115), agreeing in all its details
with the other copies, in so far, at least, as the information
obtained seems to indicate. In an elaborately decorated
cartouch near the south polar region is the dedicatory inscription,
reading &#8220;Globum hujusmodi Terraqueum Guglielmo
invictissimo ac potentissimo Magnae Britaniae etc. Regi
Dicat, Vocat. consecrat. Pater, Magister Vincentius Coronelli
Mon. Con. S. Francisci Serenissimae Venetorum Reipublicae
Cosmographus MDCLXXXXVI. Londini.&#8221; &#8220;This
terrestrial globe, Father and Master Vincentio Coronelli,
Brother of the Franciscan Order and Cosmographer of the
Venetian Republic, dedicates, names and consecrates to William
III, the Invincible and Mighty King of Great Britain.&#8221;
Not far from the above is a somewhat elaborate representation
of the king&#8217;s coat of arms with the motto &#8220;Hony soit
qui mal y pense. Je maintienderay.&#8221; Its mounting consists
of a narrow graduated meridian circle of wood which is116
made to pass, in the usual manner, through a horizon circle
of wood, the outer edge of which is octagonal. The upper
surface of this horizon circle is covered with an engraved
horizon sheet giving within concentric circles the names of
the zodiacal constellations, names of the months with the
names of the prominent saints, the names of the principal
winds, and of the principal directions in Italian. It has a
supporting base of four artistically turned columns with
binding crossbars extending from each post to a central circular
plate 17 cm. in diameter, carrying the post through a
slot in which the meridian circle is made to pass. The north
pole is topped with a thin pasteboard hour circle and pointer.
The globe map is composed of twelve gores which are truncated
in latitude 80 degrees both north and south, the polar
spaces being covered with circular discs, and are cut on the
line of the equator. The sphere is exceedingly light in
weight, being composed of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;. In every particular
the globe is one remarkably well preserved, and is one of the
finest examples of early globe making in the society&#8217;s
collection.

In geographical names the map records are very full, these
being given either in Italian, Spanish, Latin, Dutch, English,
or in the native language of the country in which they
appear. Curiously enough in many instances the author appears
to give his own peculiar spelling, approaching therein,
to the best of his ability, the spelling suggested by the pronunciation
of the several names. Legends are exceedingly
numerous, many of them recording incidents relating to
certain expeditions or to certain discoveries, such as the
expedition of Magellan; early expeditions along the west
coast of North America, including reference to Cortes,
Ulloa, Alar&ccedil;on, Cabrillo, Guzman, Drake; expeditions to the
East Indies, including that of Le Maire, Hoorn, Van Diemen,
Chaumont, and others. Boundary lines of local regions, in
both the Old and the New World are exceedingly numerous,
which fact in itself gives a somewhat unique value to the
117map as of geographical and historical value. California appears
as an island, and a great stretch of ocean appears
between northwest North America and northeast Asia
wherein is located land with indefinite outline marked,
&#8220;Terra de Jesso &oacute; Jeco, Yedco, Esso et Sesso Scoperta dagli
Hollandesi l&#8217;anno 1643.&#8221; The map of North America is
particularly of interest and value, especially for the region
of the United States.

Pictures of ships sailing the ocean, those of the oriental
peoples as well as those of the occidental are numerous, as
are also pictures representing seal fishing, and pictures representing
the methods of capturing polar bears and whales.
It is interesting to note that loxodromic lines or sailing lines
have disappeared from such maps, that the map and the
chart are here seen to merge.

The celestial globe of this edition has practically the same
dedication as the terrestrial, the word &#8220;Terraqueum&#8221; alone
being changed to &#8220;Coelestem.&#8221; There is on this the following
address: &#8220;Amico Lettore. Oltre ai molti Globi delineati
dal P. Cosmografo Coronelli per Sovrani diversi di varie e
vaste misure, ne ha ultimamente composti e stampati di
cinque grandezze a pubblico beneficio, fra i quali i pi&ugrave;
comodi ed esatti sono i presenti. I numeri che accompagnano
le stelle calcolate all&#8217;epoca del 1700; cos&igrave; l&#8217;altre notizie,
ad uso dei medesimi Globi, vengono nel suo Epitome Cosmografico
diffusamente spiegati.&#8221; &#8220;Dear reader. Besides the
many globes delineated by the cosmographer P. Coronelli,
for divers Sovereigns, he has recently composed and printed
some in five sizes for the use of the public, among which the
most convenient and exact are the present ones. The numbers
that accompany the stars are calculated for the epoch
1700; moreover the other particulars for the use of these
same globes are extensively developed in his Epitome
Cosmografico.&#8221;

In the reference to the several constellations there is repeated,
with but slight alteration, the statements made on118
his larger globes, the position of the fixed stars being referred
to the year 1700.

Examples of the 1696 edition of Coronelli&#8217;s globes may
be found in the Seminario Vescovile of Finale; in the Biblioteca
Franzoniana of Genoa; in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum
of N&uuml;rnberg; in the Biblioteca Comunale of
Perugia; in the Museo Civico of Trieste; a copy of the terrestrial
in the Biblioteca Nazionale of Florence, and one in
the Certosa of Pisa; the unmounted gores of the celestial in
the Museo Astronomico of Rome.

The globes of the year 1696 were reissued in the year
1699, with certain unimportant alterations. It may be noted
that as in certain copies of the 1693 edition the cartouch
designed for a dedicatory inscription was left blank, that the
author might insert the name of the recipient whom he might
choose to honor. So in his globes of the year 1699 he left a
like blank space, but in the terrestrial globe he inscribed
what he evidently felt he should want to insert in each
instance&mdash;a dedication in blank, as it were, reading &#8220;D. D. D.
Pater Magister Vincentius Coronelli Mon: Con:
Francisci Serenissimae Venetorum Reipublicae Cosmographus
MDCLXXXXIX.&#8221; One example has been located in
which the name of the honored individual has been inserted,
reading, in addition to the author and date as above, &#8220;Illustrissimo
et Praexcelso Nobili Viro D. D. Comiti Aloysio
Paoluccio Militiae Sanctae Apostolicae Sedis in Piceno Praefecto,&#8221;
this copy being in the Biblioteca Privato of Sr. Remigio
Salotti of Modena. Copies of each of the 1699 issue may
also be found in the Biblioteca Marucelliana of Florence;
in the Biblioteca Vittorio Emanuele of Rome; in the Biblioteca
of the Marquis Piero Bargagli of Rome; a copy of the
terrestrial in the Museo Astronomico of Rome, a copy of the
same in the Biblioteca Nazionale of Florence, and a copy
in the Certosa of Pisa.

In one of his own publications issued in Venice in the year
1697 Coronelli tells us of an edition of his celestial globe
119which he was preparing.101 He announces &#8220;To the Public&#8221;
that the large celestial globe, three and one half feet in
diameter, which he was then having re&euml;ngraved and which
would exhibit all of the artistic features of the Paris edition
of 1693, would be one of superior excellence. He adds that
the many corrections and additions, as the parts already
completed clearly indicate, would make it one very exact,
and its completion was promised before the end of the year
1698. This celestial globe was issued in Venice in the year
1699, edited, according to an inscribed legend, by Coronelli
and the Academy of the Argonauts. We cannot with certainty
locate a copy of this globe. Perhaps it may be found
in one of the undated examples, now known, of the size
designated.

The Abbot Gimma, to whom reference has been made,
informs us that Coronelli constructed other globes, the same
having diameters respectively six, four, and two inches, and
in the &#8216;Epitome Cosmografica&#8217; of the author, under the paragraph
heading, &#8220;Opere stampate dal Padre Coronelli,&#8221; we
read that he constructed celestial and terrestrial globes three
inches in diameter for the pocket. In Volume X of the
&#8216;Atlanta Veneto,&#8217; under the title &#8220;Globi del Coronelli,&#8221; the
gores of these globes are reproduced, and from these reprints
we are able to get certain information concerning them. But
one pair of his six-inch globes has been located and none
of the smaller size, this one pair being the unmounted gores,
twelve in number for each globe, to be found in the British
Museum. The terrestrial has the following dedication: &#8220;Hos
Globos Terraqueum ac Coelestem dicat et donat R. m&#772;o P. D.
Sigismundo Pollitio a Placentia Praeposito Generali Monarchorum

Fiorini makes brief mention of a rather remarkable armillary
sphere, cut out of a solid block of alabaster, now
belonging to the Museo Civico of Siena.102 It is neither
signed nor dated, but was probably constructed toward the
close of the seventeenth century.

It has two meridian circles, circles representing the tropics
whose outer circumference is 66 cm., polar circles having a
circumference of 21 cm., and circles representing the solstitial
colures and the equator, the latter having an outer circumference
of 72 cm. All circles are graduated, but in the
case of the polar circles the numbers of the degrees are not
marked. In addition to the above-mentioned circles, there is
one representing the zodiac which is exceedingly heavy, on
which have been cut the signs of the several constellations
and the names of the months.

This assemblage of armillae is adjusted to revolve within
a brass circle, the whole resting upon a base of alabaster. At
the common center is a small ball mounted on a metallic
rod which passes through the poles of the circles. This small
terrestrial sphere has a diameter of 8 cm., and around it
are two small circles probably intended to represent the path
of the moon and of the planet Mercury.

Word has been received of another armillary sphere of
about 1700, though undated, constructed by Vitale Giordani
(1633-1711), a mathematician of some note in his day.
This sphere belongs to the Biblioteca Lancisiana of Rome,
which, as noted above, possesses one by Barocci of the year
1570.103

The idea of constructing large manuscript globes, such as
121were those of Benci and of Moroncelli, was taken up by Giuseppe
Scarabelli of Mirandola, who appears to have won
special distinction in his day as an engineer.104 Although the
large globes, terrestrial and celestial, three braccia (ca. 200
cm.) in diameter, which he is known to have made, assisted
by his son Massimo, cannot now be located, we are told
that they were of such size and quality that their equal could
not be found &#8220;in Milan, in Venice, or in Rome.&#8221;

In what has been stated above concerning globe makers of
Italy in the late seventeenth century and the early eighteenth,
it has been noted that a number of those most prominent
were members of some one or other of the many monastic
orders. Benci and Moroncelli were of the Silvestrin
Congregation; Coronelli was a Minorite, being honored with
an election to the office of General of the Franciscan Order.
It was in the late seventeenth century that Giovanni Battista
da Cassine,105 a Capuchin monk, began to achieve distinction
as a map and globe maker, in particular, however, through
the maps he drafted of the various provinces of his order
which he described in his &#8216;Descrizione cosmografica della
Provincie e dei Conventi de FF: Min. Cappuccini di S.
Francesco.&#8217;106 He was a native of Cassine in the district of
Alessandria, and entered in early life into the Convent of the
Immaculata Concezzione of Milan. He tells us, in his introduction
to his work noted above, that he constructed two
globes for the library of his convent in Milan, a terrestrial
and a celestial, adding, &#8220;Quondam aedificabam, simul et
delineabam pro Bibliotheca nostra Immacolatae Conceptionis
duos satis grandes Globos nimirum coelestem unum,
terrestrem alium.&#8221; &#8220;I once designed and constructed for our
library of the Immaculate Conception, two large globes, one
a terrestrial, the other a celestial.&#8221; We do not know the
exact date of the construction of these globes, but it probably
was near 1700.107 It is further probable that these globes
were examples of Italy&#8217;s best productions within this field.
They, however, cannot now be located, having disappeared122
at the time of the dissolution of the convent in the year
1810.

George Christopher Eimmart (1638-1705), a native of
Ravensburg, was one of Germany&#8217;s most famous mathematicians
of the seventeenth century.108 He is reported to have
been for some time associated with Erhard Weigel in
the University of Jena, where he won distinction for himself
in his mathematical and law studies. It was about the
year 1658, after the death of his father, that he became
especially interested in the art of copper engraving, and in
the year 1660 he established himself in this business in the
city of N&uuml;rnberg. The study of mathematics, however, continued
to interest him, and we soon find him giving especial
attention to astronomical science, to the construction of
astronomical instruments, such as quadrants, sextants, telescopes,
astronomical clocks, and celestial spheres. In one
of the fortifications of the city he erected a small observatory,
in which he carried on his astronomical studies, evincing,
as the months passed, much interest in giving practical
instruction to many of the young students of the city, among
whom may be named Johannes Philipp W&uuml;rzelbauer, who
later was ennobled by Emperor Leopold on account of his
scientific attainments, and who at the time of the reception
of this honor changed his name to Wurzelbau. Eimmart
counted among his friends, with whom he was in constant
communication, Leibnitz, Cassini, La Hire, Flamsteed, Hevel,
and others. His correspondence with these distinguished men
of science, together with his numerous papers relating to his
mathematical and astronomical studies, are still preserved
in manuscript, filling no less than fifty-seven volumes.109 In
the year 1695 he published a description of an armillary
sphere which he had constructed to represent the Copernican
system, but this cannot now be located.110 In the year 1705,
the year of his death, he issued a pair of globes, an example
of each being now kept in the Museo Astronomico of Rome.
These spheres of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;, each having a diameter of123
about 30 cm., are supplied each with a base of wood, consisting
of four turned columns, which support a horizon circle
of wood, on which are the usual engraved concentric
circles bearing respectively the names of the principal directions
or winds, the names of the zodiacal constellations,
with their respective figures, the names of the principal
festivals, and names of the saints. They are made to revolve
within a graduated meridian circle which is adjusted to move
within the horizon circle. The globe balls are covered with
engraved gore maps, each consisting of twelve sections cut
at the equatorial line and in latitude 80 degrees, the polar
areas being covered with a circular disc, having the necessary
radius of ten degrees.

On the terrestrial globe we find the following author and
date legend: &#8220;Cum geographica Orbis Terrarum descriptio
secundum long. et lat. non nisi vel per peregrinationes marittimas
vel observationes coelestes emendatior in dies prodeat,
istud autem per experimenta propria (quo ad exiguam

immutantes, prout ab auctoribus novissimis accepimus usui

Christi 1705.&#8221; &#8220;Since the geographical description of the
earth according to latitude and longitude, both by maritime
voyages and by celestial observations becomes more accurate
day by day, it happens to scarcely any one man to perfect
(a globe) by his own observations for these can be partial
only. Therefore it behooves us to make use of the most
accurate modern observations. In so far as they agree with
the truth or depart from it it is left for you with your more
exact judgment to decide. We, for our part, exhibit for your
use the places in all good faith, as we have received them
from the latest authorities and have changed nothing.
N&uuml;rnberg. By G. C. Eimmart, 1705.&#8221;

124Meridians and parallels are represented at intervals of
five degrees, the ecliptic and the equator being graduated.
Compass roses are numerous, from which radiate numerous
loxodromic lines. The several compass roses are located on
the equator, and at latitude 35 degrees and 70 degrees both
north and south, where these parallels are crossed by the
prime meridian and the meridians of 90 degrees, of 180
degrees, and of 270 degrees.

In the southern hemisphere of the celestial globe is the
following inscription: &#8220;Loca stellarum coelesti huic Globo
insertarum a Jo. Hevelio astronomo insigni ad ann. 1700
complet. sum&#772;o studio ac diuturnis vigiliis restituta sunt;
quae in hujusmodi Typum ad perpetuam Coeli conformitatem
juxta modum quem Problema inferius adjectum praescribit
noviter redacta a G. C. Eimmarto.&#8221; &#8220;The position
of the stars inscribed on this celestial globe were determined
by J. Hevelius, renowned astronomer, and completed to the
year 1700 through deep study and nightly vigils. And these
observations on this globe are made perpetually to conform,
according to the method which is described below, and these
have been revised by G. C. Eimmart.&#8221;

Attention is called to the stars of the various magnitudes
up to the seventh by an appropriate illustration of each
placed in a small but artistically designed wreath. Latin
names are given to the several constellations and to a number
of the individual stars, though one finds an occasional
Arabic name. Among the several constellations one notes
certain modern names such as &#8220;Scutum Subiescianum.&#8221;

In addition to the pair referred to above, a copy of the
celestial globe may be found in the Biblioteca Civico of
Bergamo.

Joseph Moxon (1627-1700) (Fig. 116) was an English
mathematician and hydrographer of great distinction.111
His earliest business, dating from about 1655, was that of
a maker and vender of mathematical instruments, but he
later turned his attention toward the designing of letters
125and the making of printing types, achieving, for his work
in this field, a very remarkable reputation. It was in his
early years, when especially interested in making mathematical
instruments in his shop in Russell Street, at &#8220;The
Sign of the Atlas,&#8221; that his thought was turned toward
geography, astronomy, and navigation; at any rate, he published
in the year 1657 an edition of Edward Wright&#8217;s
&#8216;Certain errors in navigation detected and corrected.&#8217;112 In
1659 he published in London the first edition of his important
work which he called &#8216;A Tutor to Astronomy and
Geography, or an easie and speedy way to know the Use
of both the Globes, Celestial and Terrestrial.&#8217; This work,
frequently reissued during his lifetime, was followed at
intervals by a number of publications chiefly relating to
the art of printing.113 As to the importance he attached to
his own knowledge of globes, he states on the title-page of
his book on their uses that he explains therein &#8220;More fully
and amply than hath yet been set forth, either by Gemma
Frisius, Metius, Hues, Wright, Blaeu, or any others that
have taught the Use of the Globes: and that so Plainly and
Methodically, that the meanest Capacity may at first Reading
apprehend it, and with a little Practice grow expert in
these Divine Sciences.&#8221; In his address &#8220;To the Reader,&#8221;
appearing as an introduction to this same work, he gives us
further word not only concerning his own globes, but an
interesting insight into what a globe maker of that time
conceived as essential points to be noted when directing
attention to his own special work. Though somewhat
lengthy, it is here quoted as an interesting early statement.
He observes in his introductory paragraph that he is writing
not &#8220;to expert Practitioners but to Learners; to whom
Examples may prove more Instructive than Precepts.

&#8220;Besides,&#8221; he states, &#8220;I hope to encourage those by an
ample liberal plainness to fall in love with the Studies, that
formerly have been disheartened by the Crabbed brevity of
those Authors that have in Characters as it were rather writ126
Notes for their own Memories, than sufficient Documents
for their Readers Instructions.

&#8220;The Globes for which this Book is written are new
Globes that I set forth, which as I told you in my Epistle to
the Reader of Blaws Book differ somewhat from other
Globes; and that both the Celestial and the Terrestrial;
mine being the latest done of any, and to the accomplishing
of which, I have not only had the help of all or most of the
best of other Globes, Maps, Plates, and Sea-drafts of New
discoveries that were then extant for the Terrestrial Globe,
but also the Advice and directions of divers able Mathematicians
both in England and Holland for Tables and Calculations
both of Lines and Stars for the Celestial; upon which
globe I have placed every Star that was observed by Tycho
Brahe and other Observers, one degree of Longitude farther
in the Ecliptick than they are on any other Globes: so
that whereas on other Globes the places of the Stars were
correspondent with their places in Heaven 69 Years ago,
when Tycho observed them, and therefore according to his
Rule want almost a degree of their true places in Heaven
at this Time: I have set every Star one degree farther in the
Ecliptick, and rectified them on the Globe according to the
true place they had in Heaven in the Year 1671.

&#8220;On the Terrestrial Globe I have inserted all the New
Discoveries that have been made, either by our own Forraign
Navigators, and that bothe in the East, West, North,
and South parts of the Earth. In the East Indies we have in
the latter Times many spacious places discovered, many
Islands inserted, and generally the whole Draught of the
Country rectified and amended, even to the Coast of China,
Japan, Giloli &amp;c. In the South Sea between the East and
West Indies are scattered many Islands, which for the uncertain
knowledge former Times had of them are either
wholly left out of other Globes, or else laid down so erroneously
that little of credit can be attributed unto them.
California is found to be an Island, though formerly supposed127
to be part of the main Continent, whose North-West
shoar was imagined to thrust itself forth close to the Coasts
of Cathaio, and so make the supposed Straights of Anian.
The Western Shoars of the West Indies are more accurately
described than formerly, as you may see if you compare my
Terrestrial Globe: that I have lately set forth with the
Journals of the latest Navigators: And if you compare them
with other Globes you will find 5, 6, yea 7 degrees difference
in Longitude in most Places of these Coasts. Magellanica
which heretofore was thought to be part of the South Continent
called Terra Incognita is now also found to be an
Island. All that Tract of Land called Terra Incognita I
have purposely omitted, because as yet we have no certainty
whether it be Land or Sea; unless it be of some parts lately
found out by the Dutch, who having a convenient Port at
Batavia in Java, have from there sent forth Ships Southward,
where they have found several very large countries;
one whereof they have called Hollandia Nova, another
Zelandia Nova, another Anthoni van Diemans Land; and
divers others; some whereof lie near our Antipodes; as you
may see by my terrestrial Globes. Again, Far to the Northwards
there are some New Discoveries, even within six
degrees of the Pole: The Drafts to the North Eastwards I
have laid down even as they were described by the Searchers
of those parts for a passage into the East Indies. And also
the Discoveries of Baffin, Captain James, and Capt. Fox
(our own Country-men) that attempted the finding a
passage that way into the South Sea.

&#8220;I also told you what difference there is in several
Authors about placing the first Meridian, which is the beginning
of Longitude; that Ptolemy placed it at the Fortunate
Islands, which Mr. Hues pag. 4. chap. 1. in his Treatise
of Globes proves to be the Islands of Cabo Verde, and
not those now called the Canary Islands; because in his
Time they were the farthest place of the Discovered World
towards the setting of the Sun; Others placed it at Pico in128
Teneriffa; Others at Corvus and Flora; because under that
Meridian the Compass had no Variation, but did then duly
respect the North and South; Others for the same Reason
begin their Longitude at St. Michaels; and Others between
the Islands of Flores and Fayal: And the Spaniards of late
by reason of their great Negotiation in the West Indies, have
begun their Longitude at Toledo there, and contrary to all
others account it Westwards.

&#8220;Therefore I, seeing such diversity among all Nations,
and as yet an Uniformity at home, chose with our own
Country-men to place my First Meridian at the Ile Gratiosa,
one of the Iles of Azores.

&#8220;By the different placing of this first Meridian it comes
to pass that the Longitude of Places are diversely set down
in different Tables; For those Globes or Maps that have
their first Meridian placed to the Eastwards of Gratiosa,
have all places counted Eastwards from the Meridian of
Gratiosa, and their first Meridian in a greater number of
degrees of Longitude, and that according as the Arch of
Difference is.&#8221;

At the conclusion of this work we find printed a catalogue
of his books, maps, and instruments, including globes celestial
and terrestrial of all sizes, and, what is of considerable
interest and value, the price of each given.114

We know that the Chinese, very many centuries ago,
manifested a considerable interest in astronomy; nor was
there wanting with them an interest in geography. It was,
however, especially in the former science they may be said
to have made contributions of real value. An unreliable
record, telling us of the interest exhibited by the Emperor
Shun, reigning more than two thousand years before the
beginning of the Christian era, notes that he made use of an
armillary sphere in his study of the stars. Little is there to
assure us that prior to the time of K&uacute;blai Kaan (1216-1294)
there were those who turned their attention to the
construction of globes. That great Mongol Emperor&#8217;s129
astronomer Ko-Shun-King, having demonstrated the superiority
of his astronomical wisdom, was directed to institute
reforms in Chinese chronology and to construct for purposes
of scientific investigations such instruments as he
thought to be necessary. Accordingly he removed from the
old observatory &#8220;an armillary sphere dating from 1049,&#8221;
substituting in its place a number of large and small instruments,
two of which have survived to our day&mdash;an armillary
sphere and a celestial globe, which may be said to date
from about the year 1274. These instruments of the astronomer
Ko-Shun-King had place in an observatory which he
had erected on the site of an ancient structure at the southeast
corner of the Tartar city wall, being raised above the
parapet. There they remained until the year 1673 when the
Jesuit astronomer Father Ferdinand Verbiest judged them
to be useless and persuaded the Emperor to pull them down
and put up new ones of his own contriving.115 The old instruments
were stored away at the foot of the terrace, and of
these, as before noted, but two now remain.

Le Comte refers to the celestial globe as one well cast, and
having a diameter of about three feet, the degrees and minutes
being marked both &#8220;longitudinally and latitudinally.&#8221;
An early description tells us that its equator is in the center,
equidistant from the two poles, in each case a quarter of a
circumference. The ecliptic is elevated above and depressed
below the equator, in each case barely twenty-four degrees.
The elevations and depressions of the moon in its orbit
being variable, a bamboo hoop, divided into degrees equally
throughout, is used to verify the intersections with the ecliptic
and accordingly is moved from time to time. The globe
rests on a square box, the north and south poles being respectively
above and below the surface fully forty degrees,
half of the globe being visible and half concealed. Toothed
wheels, set in motion by machinery concealed within the
box, are so adjusted as to cause the globe to revolve.

The armillary sphere (Fig. 117) stands at the east end130
of the court. It is an instrument of huge dimensions being
described in early records somewhat as follows, in each reference
there being allusion to its beautiful workmanship,
and to its design as possessing remarkable excellence. The
supporting base of the piece has a mythological significance.
The four dragons, which play such a part in the Chinese
geomancy, are here represented as chained to the earth, while
upholding the spheres. Its substantial horizon circle, crossed
at right angles by a double ring representing an azimuth
circle, forms the outer supporting framework. The upper
surface of the horizon circle is divided into twelve equal
parts, marked by the several Chinese cyclical characters
applied to the twelve hours into which the day and night
was divided. Around the outside of this horizon circle these
twelve characters appear again, with the Chinese names for
the several points of the compass. On the inside of this
circle one finds the names of the twelve States into which
the ancient Empire was divided, each State being thought
of as under the influence of a particular quarter of the
heavens.

height="428" alt="Ancient Mongolian Armillary Sphere, ca. 1274." title="" />

Fig. 117. Ancient Mongolian Armillary Sphere, ca. 1274.

Inside this frame is placed an equatorial circle within
which is a series of movable circles made to turn on polar
pivots attached to the azimuth circle. These movable circles
consist of an equatorial circle, a double ring ecliptic, an
equinoctial colure, and a double ring solstitial colure. The
equator is divided into twenty-eight unequal portions
marked by the names of as many constellations of very
ancient origin. The ecliptic is divided into twenty-four
equal parts according with the divisions of the year. Within
the circles just described there is a double revolving meridian
with a double axis and within this a fixed tube for taking
sights.

All the circles of this armillary sphere are divided into
365&frac14; degrees corresponding to the days of the year and
each degree is divided into hundreds. At the corners of the
base outside the dragons are four miniature rocks in bronze,
131with the respective inscriptions &#8220;Keen Shan,&#8221; northwest or
celestial mountain; &#8220;Kwan Shan,&#8221; southwest or terrestrial
mountain; &#8220;Seuen-Shan,&#8221; or southeast mountain; &#8220;Kan
Shan,&#8221; northeast mountain.

When the astronomer P&egrave;re Ferdinand Verbiest (1623-1688),116
undertook the survey and management of mathematics
for the Emperor he, like his predecessor Ko-Shun-King
four hundred years before, began his task, as noted
above, by ordering the removal of the old instruments from
the observatory and the construction of new ones. Six of
these are referred to in the records of the period as possessing
especial merit, including a zodiacal armillary sphere six feet
in diameter, an equinoctial armillary sphere six feet in diameter,
a horizon azimuth likewise six feet in diameter, a
quadrant having a radius of six feet, a sextant with a radius
of eight feet, and a celestial globe having a diameter of
six feet.

The armillary spheres have each but four circles, being
of excellent workmanship, and having mountings of elaborate
Chinese designs.

That which especially interests us here is the celestial
globe (Fig. 117a) which Le Compte describes somewhat in
detail. &#8220;This in my Opinion,&#8221; he says, &#8220;is the fairest and
best fashioned of all the Instruments. The Globe itself is
brazen, exactly round and smooth; the Stars well made, and
in their true places, and all Circles of proportional breadth
and thickness. It is besides so well hung, that the least touch
moves it, and tho&#8217; it is above two thousand weight, the least
Child may elevate it to any Degree. On its large concave
Bases are placed opposite four Dragons, whose Hair standing
up on end, support a noble Horizon commendable for its
breadth, its several Ornaments, and the delicacy and niceness
of the Work. The Meridian in which the Pole is fixed
rests upon Clouds that issue out of the Bases, and slides
easily between them, its Motion being facilitated by some
hidden Wheels, and moves with it the whole Globe to give132
it the required Elevation. Besides which, the Horizon,
Dragons and two brazen Beams, which lie cross in the
Center of the Bases Concavity, are all moved at pleasure
without stirring the Bases which still remain fixed; this
facilitates the due placing of the Horizon, whether in respect
of the Natural Horizon, or in respect of the Globe. I
wonder how Men who live six thousand Leagues from us
could go through such a piece of Work; and I must own,
that if all the Circles which are divided, had been corrected
by some of our Workmen, nothing could be more perfect in
this kind.&#8221; This piece, it may be noted, was carried away
to Potsdam at the close of the Boxer Rebellion, copies of
them being left in the old observatory. The Treaty of Versailles
directed that the originals should be returned to their
early home.

states that some of his lectures were given in the open because there was
no available room sufficiently large to accommodate his hearers.

heraldicorum ipsiusque pancosmi descriptio et usus. Jenae, 1688; Wolf,
Geschichte der Astronomie, pp. 420-427. In a very early day the Venerable
Bede had suggested a change from the heathen names of the several constellations
to Christian names. See in this connection Schiller, J. Coelum
stellatum christianum. Augsburg, 1627.

Schiller was a pupil of the famous astronomer, Johannes Bayer, from
whom he probably received his impulse to inaugurate a reform in the
matter of naming the constellations. Schiller felt much annoyed that
heathen names for stars and star groups should be retained by Christian
peoples, and it was probably with Bayer that he worked out his scheme for
a new nomenclature. To the twelve signs of the zodiac, for example, he gave
the names of the twelve apostles. For the constellation Perseus he proposed
the Apostle Paul, for the Great Bear the Ship of Peter, for Hercules the
Three Kings, for Cassiopeia the name Maria Magdalena, for Auriga
Saint Jerome; he further proposed to change the name Ophiuchus to Pope
Benedict, Pegasus to the Angel Gabriel, Orion to Joseph, Canis Major to
King David, the Ship Argo to the Ark of Noe, the Centaur to Abraham, the
Peacock to Eve.

It was proposed to change the name Sun to Christ, the Moon to Maria,
Saturn to Adam, Jupiter to Moses, Mars to Joshua, Venus to John the
Baptist, and Mercury to Elias.

The suggestions of Schiller, of Bayer, and of their contemporaries, or
near contemporaries, Schickard, Bartsch, and Harsd&ouml;rfer, with the added
support of Weigel, seem to have found little favor among astronomers.

Globes and Globe Makers of the First
Half of the Eighteenth Century&mdash;from
Delisle to Ferguson

Activities of Guillaume Delisle.&mdash;Jean Dominique Cassini and his
reforms.&mdash;Vincenzo Miot.&mdash;The globes of Gerhard and Leonhard
Valk.&mdash;Activities of John Senex.&mdash;Nicolas Bion.&mdash;The armillary
sphere of Carmelo Cartilia.&mdash;Mattheus Seutter of Augsburg.&mdash;Robert
Morden.&mdash;Jean Antoine Nollet.&mdash;Johann Gabriel Doppelmayr
of N&uuml;rnberg.&mdash;Terrestrial globe of Cusani.&mdash;Terrestrial
globes of Siena.&mdash;The work of the monk Pietro Maria da
Vinchio.&mdash;James Ferguson of Scotland.

AMONG the numerous globe makers of the eighteenth
century, there are few, if any, entitled to rank with
Blaeu or Hondius, with Greuter or Coronelli of the
seventeenth. There was much written during the period, it is
true, on the value of globes in geographical and astronomical
studies, and there were many globes constructed, of which a
very considerable number still have a place in our libraries,
museums, and private collections.

With the improvements in scientific map construction,
improvements amounting to a complete reformation, and
ushered in during the closing years of the seventeenth century
and the opening years of the eighteenth, by such men
as Riccioli, Picard, Cassini, and Delisle, not to mention a
number of their distinguished immediate predecessors and
contemporaries, the last above-named working through the138
patronage of the Royal Academy of Science of France,117&mdash;with
these improvements there appears to have been a decline
in the relative value which the late sixteenth and the
seventeenth centuries set upon globes. Once regarded as an
essential part of a seaman&#8217;s instruments for use in navigation,
they gave place, just as the portolan chart of the earlier
day gave place, to an improved sailor&#8217;s chart. Globe makers,
however, of this period, such as Delisle and Bion, as Gerhard
and Leonhard Valk, as Vaugondy and Fortin, as Ferguson
and Adams, have an honorable place in the history of
globes and of globe construction.

France was leading at the turn of the seventeenth century
in the field of geographical and astronomical science, a fact
in part due to the generous subsidy allowed by royalty.
Guillaume Delisle (1675-1726), perhaps the greatest
among the reformers active in these years in improving the
methods of map construction, was a native of Paris, in which
city he passed practically his entire life.118 The father, Claude
Delisle, famous as a teacher of history and geography,
inspired in his son a particular love for the latter subject,
or perhaps this may the better be referred to as a love for
historical geography. The period was one in which there was
much emphasis placed upon the relationship existing between
the two branches of study, and it is interesting to
note that this phase of geographical study is again coming
into favor.119

Doubtless it was in part the influence of Cassini&#8217;s teaching
which found expression in Delisle&#8217;s lifelong efforts to
eliminate the numerous errors which he had found existing
in the maps of his day, efforts which even in his early life
won for him distinction as a map maker. In the year 1700,
when he was but twenty-five years of age, there appeared
under his name a world map and likewise maps of the several
continents.120 In these there was exhibited much originality,
they being constructed in the main on the basis of astronomical
observations which had been made at the Royal
139
Academy. Hitherto the Ptolemaic cartography had exerted
an overpowering influence. Errors in the location of places
still remained on the maps, attributable in large part to that
ancient cosmographer, who continued for so long a period
a most influential teacher of geography and map making
after the renaissance of his &#8216;Cosmographia&#8217; in the early fifteenth
century. Among the greatest errors still to be found
in the maps in Delisle&#8217;s day was the excessive length given
to the Mediterranean, this being about sixty-two degrees of
longitude instead of its correct length, which is about forty-two,
and the extension of Asia much too far to eastward,
together with other errors following upon these.121 Delisle,
having the support of the Royal Academy, and of the King
himself, was able to carry through the reforms in map construction,
the fundamental principles of which, it is true,
had been suggested before his day, based upon such astronomical
observations as were those of Cassini, Picard, and
La Hire, wherein there had been an attempt to determine
the exact location in longitude of important places on the
earth&#8217;s surface and wherein they had been aided by the use
of the telescope. Through the employment of this instrument
they were able to fix the exact time of eclipses and
determine the time of the transit of the moons of Jupiter.122
In the &#8216;Journal des Savants&#8217; of the year 1700 is given a
letter addressed to the engraver and map maker, Nolin, and
signed &#8220;Delisle.&#8221; In this there is reference to a manuscript
globe of the year 1696, the implication being that Guillaume
was its author.123 The probability is that we have here a letter
written by Claude, the father, it being hardly probable that
the son drafted a globe map at the age of twenty-one. We,
however, know, as before stated, that he achieved great
distinction through the maps he published in the year 1700,
when he was but twenty-five, and we are also informed that
even at the age of eight he attracted attention to himself
through the maps he drew to illustrate ancient history.

In the same year that he published his epoch-making maps140
he issued the first edition of his globes, those having a diameter
of about 31 cm. and those having a diameter of about
15 cm. The globe balls were constructed of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;
covered with plaster over which were pasted the gore maps,
each map composed of twelve parts with the usual polar
discs. The engraver, we are told, in a brief legend on the
terrestrial globe, was Carolus Simonneau, &#8220;Car. Simon. del.
et sculpsit.&#8221; On the larger of the terrestrial globes is the
title legend &#8220;Globe terrestre dress&eacute; sur les observations de
l&#8217;Acad&eacute;mie Royale des sciences et autres m&eacute;moires,&#8221; and a
dedication reading, &#8220;&Agrave; Son Altesse Royale Monseigneur Le
Duc de Chartres. Par son tr&egrave;s humble et tr&egrave;s ob&eacute;issant serviteur
G. De l&#8217;Isle G&eacute;ographie. Berey sculpsit.&#8221;

The celestial globe bears the title, &#8220;Globe c&eacute;leste calcul&eacute;
pour l&#8217;an 1700. Sur les observations les plus r&eacute;cents. Par. G.
De l&#8217;Isle G&eacute;ographe,&#8221; and is dedicated &#8220;&Agrave; Son Altesse
Royale Monseigneur le Duc de Chartres. Par son tr&egrave;s humble
et tr&egrave;s ob&eacute;issant Serviteur De l&#8217;Isle,&#8221; with the following
reference to the privilege &#8220;&Agrave; Paris Chez l&#8217;Auteur sur le
Quai de l&#8217;Horologe &agrave; la Couronne de Diamans. Avec Privil&eacute;ge
du Roy pour 20 ans. 1700.&#8221;

While it has not been possible to obtain a detailed description
of Delisle&#8217;s globe maps, they are referred to as
giving practically the same information as his plane maps,
many of the latter to be found in our important library
collections, and cannot be considered rare.124

The several constellations which he has represented on
his celestial globes are those of Ptolemy to which have
been added two in the northern hemisphere and thirteen in
the southern, and the year chosen for the representation of
the position of the stars is 1700. In general the names chosen
for the several constellations are French, though a few are
in Latin.

A pair of Delisle&#8217;s globes may be found in the K&ouml;nigliches
Museum of Cassel, dated 1709; a pair dated 1700 in the
Museo di Strumenti Antichi of Florence, and a terrestrial
141globe dated 1700 in the Real Biblioteca of Madrid (Fig.
118).

Weigel, Castlemaine, Coronelli, and Treffler, as has been
noted, represented a tendency in globe construction in their
day which we have referred to as the ultrapractical. It was
impossible that their ideas should find anything like a general
acceptance and approval. A globe eleven or fifteen feet
in diameter, in the better judgment of astronomers and
geographers, could not be counted as possessing superior
scientific value, and globes of such dimensions seem only to
have won the praise of the novelty-loving contemporaries,
and the same general criticism may be passed upon the
smaller globes of Castlemaine and Treffler. Perhaps, however,
one may well add that in all this a desire was expressing
itself for improvement in globe construction.

In this connection attention may be called to a plan for
reform in globe making proposed by Jean Dominique Cassini
(1625-1712), one of the most famous astronomers of
the period.125 Cassini was a native of P&eacute;rinaldo, Italy (Fig.
119). Early in life he became interested in the study of
astronomy, and at the age of twenty-five received an appointment
as professor of this science at the University of
Bologna. Recommended by Colbert as one worthy his royal
master&#8217;s patronage, Cassini in 1669 accepted the invitation
of Louis XIV to fill the chair of astronomy in the Coll&egrave;ge
de France, a position once held by Pierre Gassendi.126 In
1671 he became the director of the Royal Observatory of
Paris, a position held in succession by four generations of
his family. To him we owe the determination of the rotation
periods of Jupiter, Venus, and Mars, the discovery of
four of Saturn&#8217;s satellites and the determination of their
periods of revolution. He devoted much time and study to
the problem of the obliquity of the ecliptic, to the precession
of the equinoxes,127 and to the determination of the latitude
and longitude of places.128 This precession, he found,
could not be represented on a celestial globe such as hitherto142
had been constructed, and he set himself to the task of devising
one on a new plan. The position of the constellations,
as indicated on the ordinary celestial globe, he, as others,
noted would soon be found to be inaccurate. What he proposed
was a globe capable of such adjustment as to obviate
this difficulty; in other words, he proposed the construction
of a globe by means of which this perpetual change might
be indicated, or one which would serve to indicate the position
of the several constellations at any time, past, present
or future.

It was to Nicolas Bion, map and globe maker of Paris
that the astronomer Cassini entrusted the manufacture of
such an instrument, and it is from him that we have a brief
description of its peculiar features.129 He tells us that the
sphere on which the several constellations were represented
was enclosed within a number of armillae representing the
celestial circles, that is, the colures, the ecliptic, the tropics,
the equator, and the polar circles. This inner sphere was
attached to a meridian circle at the poles of its equator,
within which circle it turned as the ordinary sphere, and it
was also attached to the same meridian at the poles of the
ecliptic. Around this polar axis of the ecliptic the sphere,
with the attached meridian, could be made to revolve, the
pole of the equator in its revolution tracing a circle having a
radius of twenty-three and a half degrees, a complete revolution
being made to represent a period of twenty-five thousand
two hundred years, or the time required for the complete
precession of the equinox according to his reckoning.
This pole in its circle of revolution could be immovably set
at any desired point to represent any time past or future,
and the sphere then revolved around the pole of the equator.
The several stars or constellations could thus be represented
in their proper position for the time selected. Bion&#8217;s reference
to this globe seems to assure us that he completed its
construction, yet no trace of it has been left, unless we have
such in a record to be found in the history of the Royal
143Academy for the year 1727. In this we find that a globe
constructed on the principle laid down by Cassini was presented
to the Academy, in the year designated, by Outhier,
a priest of Besan&ccedil;on.130 This globe, which has disappeared,
had the double movements, one about the axis of the equator
and one about the axis of the ecliptic. It was a globe
which would represent the daily and annual movements of
the sun, the difference between the true and the mean time,
the movements of the moon and its phases, the eclipses, and
the passing of the several fixed stars across the meridian.

Vincenzo Miot, a little-known Italian globe maker of the
early eighteenth century, holds a place among the men who
were interested in this field, through one extant example of
his work, this being a small celestial, having a diameter of
about 17 cm.131 Its author and date legend reads, &#8220;Sphaera
Mundi majoribus et minoribus circulis distincta praecipuisque
stellis in nostro Horizonte conspicuis ornata ad
annum 1710. Studio et opera D. Vincentio Miot.&#8221; &#8220;World
globe marked by large and small circles, and adorned with
the principal stars visible in our horizon calculated for the
year 1710. By the learning and labor of D. Vincentio Miot.&#8221;
The sphere is covered with an engraved map showing the
several constellations and the principal celestial circles. Its
twelve segments are fashioned to terminate at the poles of
the ecliptic, instead of at the poles of the equator, a practice
not uncommon. The globe has a simple mounting of wood,
is reported to be in good condition, and may be found in the
Liceo Marco Foscarini of Venice, to which library it came,
in the year 1807, from the Convent of S. Georgio Maggiore.

It is not a little surprising that our information is so
meager concerning men as active in the field of map and
globe making as were Gerhard and Leonhard Valk in the
latter part of the seventeenth and early eighteenth century.
We cannot be certain of their relationship; apparently they
were not brothers, as has been sometimes stated. If there is
not left to us a biographical word by any admiring or appreciative144
contemporary of these praiseworthy Netherlanders,
there is extant a very considerable amount of their work
which warrants our giving them rank well toward the van
of those interested in their particular field. Of the two,
Gerhard seems to have been the more prominent, his name
very frequently appearing as the engraver or maker of many
of the maps one finds in the collective atlases of the early
eighteenth century.132 With Leonhard he was the maker of
globes, large and small, ranging from about 7 cm. to 46 cm.
in diameter, of which a very considerable number may still
be found in our libraries and museums.

In an undated work published by Gerhard on the uses of
celestial and terrestrial globes,133 he tells us of the improvements
he introduced, noting that he had attempted to give
the location of the stars on his celestial globe as late as 1700,
while on those issued prior to his own, the dates selected
were in general 1640 or 1660. The suggestion contained
herein is that he at least began the construction of his globes
as early as 1700, although none are now known bearing date
so early.134 There appears to be an example of his work in
the University Library of Ghent, dated 1707, but a description
of this it has not been possible to obtain. The date most
commonly found on the Valk globes is 1750, all of which,
if correctly dated, were issued long after their death.

The Hispanic Society of America possesses three pairs of
the Valk globes, each apparently dated 1750, though in some
instances, as noted below, these dates have been altered by
skilfully cutting out the last two figures of the original and
inserting the number 50. The diameter of each of the
largest pair is 46 cm. (Fig. 120). Each is supplied with a
graduated meridian circle of brass, the celestial being furnished
with a brass hour circle and pointer, and the terrestrial
with a brass quadrant of altitude. Each is further furnished
with a broad horizon circle of wood on which has
been pasted an engraved paper giving the names of the signs
of the zodiac, the various chronological signs, such as golden
145numbers, epacta, and dominical letters, the names of the
months, and points of the compass, including both the old
and the new nomenclature for the directions of winds, as
&#8220;Borro Lybicus&#8221; or &#8220;Noord-West,&#8221; &#8220;Zephyrus&#8221; or &#8220;West.&#8221;
The under supports of the globes consist in each instance of
four turned columns attached at their lower extremities by
crossbars on which rests a circular turned plate 42 cm. in
diameter. From the center of these plates rises a post 10 cm.
in length through a notch in which the brass meridian circle
is made to pass in moving the globes to an adjustment for
any desired altitude. The gores of each are twelve in number,
those of the terrestrial globe having an equatorial
mounting while those of the celestial globe have an ecliptic
mounting, that is, the meridian lines pass from pole to pole
of the ecliptic instead of from pole to pole of the equator.
In each, the gores have been truncated twenty degrees from
the poles, the polar space being covered by circular discs.
The engraving of both the terrestrial and the celestial map is
exquisitely done, and much of the color originally applied
by hand yet remains. The several figures representing the
constellations are copies of the figures as represented by
Hevelius in his &#8216;Prodromus Astronomiae,&#8217; and reference to
this great astronomer is made in the title legend quoted below.
These figures are among the most artistic representations
to be found on any of the globes of the period, which
the author is preparing to reissue in facsimile as a by-product
of these globe studies. (Fig. 120a.)

Between the constellations &#8220;Cetus&#8221; and &#8220;Phoenix&#8221; on the
celestial globe is a cartouch which appears to have been
pasted over an older title, reading, &#8220;Uranographia Syderum
et Stelarum in Singulis Syderibus conspicuarum, exhibens
Delineatonem accuratissimam qua ex observationibus Astronomi

the constellations and of the single stars, exhibiting an accurate
delineation (of the same) corrected from the observations
of the renowned astronomer Johannes Hevelius, and
conformed to the year 1700. Besides a new method is added,
the invention of Lothar Zumbach, M. D., and a renowned
mathematician, accurately exhibiting the horizon on the
meridian of Amsterdam for more than 200 years, also the
changes of the moon in addition to the common years and
leap years. By the learning and the labor of Gerhard and
Leonhard Valk, citizens of Amsterdam, 1750.&#8221;

Near the constellation Argo appears the dedication to the
Burgomaster of Amsterdam and President of the East India
Company, Johannes Trip J. U. D. (1664-1732). In this
there is, of course, conclusive evidence that the globe must
have been made before the year 1732. The dedication reads,
&#8220;Viro amplissima dignitate ac meritorum Splendore, conspicuo
Johanni Trip J. U. D. Reipublicae Amstelaedamensis
Consuli Gravissimo, Societatis Indiae Orientalis Moderatori

J. U. D., Consul of the Amsterdam Republic, President of
the East India Company, the upright and honorable magistrate
of Berkenrode, a man conspicuous by reason of his
great worth and the splendor of his achievements, this globe
is dedicated with reverence which is befitting by Gerhard
and Leonhard Valk.&#8221;

Near the first legend has been pasted the following brief
printed statement, &#8220;Propter motum, Stellarum fixarum versus
ortum post annum 1750 additione 3/4 gr. Correctio Longitudinum
ut instituatur monendus Uranophilus.&#8221; &#8220;Because
of the movement of the fixed stars toward the east since the
year 1750, the student of astronomy is advised to correct the
147longitude by the addition of 3/4 of a degree.&#8221; The terrestrial
globe map, composed of eighteen gores, is filled with interesting
geographical details, with geographical names and
brief explanatory legends, being a fine example of the superior
cartographical work published in that century in the
Netherlands. There is something of an exaggeration in the
representation by waving line of the several coasts and
river courses, all of which appears to have been done for
artistic effect rather than for a desire to be strictly accurate.
In the New World we find such regional names as &#8220;Penn-Sylvania,&#8221;
the first part of the name being north of Lake
Ontario, also &#8220;Carolina,&#8221; &#8220;Virginia,&#8221; &#8220;Belgia Nova,&#8221; &#8220;Anglia,&#8221;
&#8220;Scotia Nova.&#8221; Many provincial names are given in
South America with boundary lines drawn. California is
represented as an island, stretching northward to &#8220;Fretum
Aniani.&#8221; To the west of this stretches as far as the northeast
coast of Asia, through about seventy-five degrees of
longitude with definitely drawn southern coast line but
extending indefinitely northward, a continental region bearing
the legend &#8220;Terra incognita sive terra Esonis.&#8221; Loxodromic
lines are represented as on the best globes of the
period radiating from numerous compass roses located along
the meridians 0 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees. Frobisher&#8217;s
Strait is strangely duplicated at the southern extremity
of Greenland. The title legend of this terrestrial globe,
placed in the southern Pacific, reads, &#8220;Universi Orbis Terrarum
Facies cum industria ac fide Secundum certissimas et
novissimas Praestantissimiorum Geographorum Observationes
denuo luci exposita; cuique praeterea longitudinis et
latitudinis gradus Secundum Uranographiam novam, ac
proinde &amp;c. rei veritate sunt inscripti per Gerhardum et Leonhardum
Valk, Amstelaedamenses 1750, cum privilegio.&#8221; &#8220;A
representation of the land of the whole earth exhibited with
industry and accuracy according to the most reliable and
the most recent observations of the most renowned geographers,
on which, in addition the degrees of latitude and longitude148
according to a new method and also in accord with
truth, have been inserted by Gerhard and Leonhard Valk.
Amsterdam. 1750. With privilege.&#8221;

In the second pair of Valk globes belonging to The Hispanic
Society of America (Fig. 121), both terrestrial and
celestial have diameters of about 30 cm. The mounting of
these globes is practically the same as that in the larger pair.
An author and date legend appearing in the Pacific to the
west of South America reads: &#8220;Cosmotheore. Coelesti nostro
Globo, Par et plane Novus. Hic Terrestris Ut existeret:
certo facias: Errore Veterum Sublat&ocirc;, Non tantum Utrisque

globe might equal (be a companion to) our celestial
globe and entirely new, be assured that after correcting the
errors of those who have preceded us, not only the longitudes
and latitudes of each sphere have been corrected by the repeated
observations of later astronomers, but likewise no
(globe) has appeared more carefully corrected in the printing.
This most recent globe therefore make use of until in a
larger form at my own expense we Gerhard and Leonhard
Valk, engravers shall construct others. Amsterdam. Revised
to the year 1750. With privilege.&#8221;

Fig. 121. Terrestrial Globe of Gerhard and
Leonhard Valk, 1750 (?).

A dedication, such as appears on the first pair referred to,
is wanting. There is no particular improvement to be noted
in this revision. California is still laid down as an island.
The uncertainty as to the outline of &#8220;Holandia Nova&#8221; is a
striking feature, as is the omission of an austral continent.
Geographical details are less numerous than in the larger
pair, but in the matter of the engraving of the map it
exhibits practically the same characteristics.

The celestial globe map has the author and date legend
149placed near the constellation &#8220;Cetus.&#8221; It reads, &#8220;Uranographia
Coelum omne hic Complectens, illa pro ut aucta, et
ad annum 1750 Completum MAGNO ab HEVELIO correcta
est; ita ejus ex Prototypis, sua noviter haec Ectypa
veris Astronomiae cultoribus exhibet et consecrant GER. et
LEON. VALK, Amstelaedamenses. Cum Privilegio.&#8221; &#8220;Star-Map
comprising the entire heavens according as it has been
corrected to the end of the year 1750 by the Great Hevelius;
so from his prototype Gerhard and Leonhard Valk present
and dedicate these their own recent copies to the true lovers
of astronomy. With privilege.&#8221;

Near this legend, now appearing as a part of the original
engraving, is that which, in the larger globe referred to
above, had been pasted on as a separate slip, reading &#8220;Propter
motum ... Uranophilus.&#8221; Near the constellation &#8220;Hydra&#8221;
is the legend reading &#8220;Monitum Novis hisce Sphaeris
Novissimus. Ex praescripto Lotharii Zum-Bach Med. Doct.
unus, et alter additus Horizon: Quorum Is, qui huic Caelesti
singularis, Praeter Communes atque Bissextilem, Ut exactior,

Plus quam per Ducentos Annos, Suis Mensium
Diebus Appositas Lunae Syzygias, Medi&ocirc; Tempore Medias,
Ingenios&acirc; Method&#333; et eruit, et exhibet.&#8221; &#8220;Notice. To these
our spheres, in accord with the directions of Lothar Zum-Bach,
Doctor of Medicine, there has been added one very
recent, and also a second horizon; of these two the one which
belongs to the celestial globe has in addition the common
and bissextile years, in order that the location of the stars
may the more exactly be discovered; it both works out and
exhibits by an ingenious method, according to the meridian
of Amsterdam, over a space of more than two hundred
years the syzygies of the moon placed opposite their proper
days of the month, the middle ones being in the middle
time.&#8221;

Each of these globes is well preserved, the colors originally
applied remaining particularly bright in the southern150
hemispheres, these being better protected from light and
from injuries incident to the more exposed upper surfaces.

In the third pair of Valk globes belonging to The Hispanic
Society (Fig. 121a) the diameter of each is about 23
cm. In geographical details, in legends, etc., each of these
agrees with the preceding second pair. It is, however, to be
noted that the date on the terrestrial globe has the figure 50
appearing in the date 1750 skilfully inserted after the removal
of the original, and that the loxodromic lines are on
this more numerous; indeed, it is one of the most interesting
globes examined for the representation of these lines, which
become curiously, but necessarily, somewhat intricate in
their crossings as they approach the poles. Of the three pairs
of these globes referred to above, this third pair seems to be
the best preserved; the only injury to be especially noted is
that appearing on the celestial, this being a crack in the surface
extending from pole to pole. The original colors in
each are particularly well preserved.

In addition to the examples of Valk globes referred to
above as belonging to the University of Ghent and to The
Hispanic Society of America, a pair may be found in the
K&ouml;nigliches Museum of Cassel, said by Gerland to be dated
1715, and to have each a diameter of 45 cm., also a terrestrial
globe in the same museum said to be dated, though
doubtless erroneously, 1700, and to have a diameter of 23
cm., also a celestial globe of the same date having a diameter
of 30 cm. In the Mathematische Salon of Dresden is a
celestial globe having a diameter of 30 cm., and a pair in
the Museo di Fisica of Bologna, the diameter of each being
about 46 cm. The date has not been ascertained. In the Germanisches
Nationalmuseum of N&uuml;rnberg may be found a
well-preserved pair of the Valk globes said to be dated 1700
and to have each a diameter of 31 cm.

John Senex, a noted English cartographer and engraver
(d. 1749),135 appears to have given some attention to the
construction of globes, which were sold at his establishment
151in Salisbury Court, London. In the year 1714 we find his
name associated with that of John Maxwell in the issue of
&#8216;The English Atlas,&#8217; and in 1721 he appears as the editor of
&#8216;A New General Atlas.&#8217; It was in the year 1720 that he made
a representation to the House of Commons on the subject of
&#8220;A New Globular Projection,&#8221; with the thought of eliciting
encouragement for the employment of better methods in
map construction. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society
in 1728, and in 1738 read before that society a noted paper
on his &#8220;Contrivance to make the Poles of the Diurnal Motion
in a Celestial Globe pass round the Poles of the Ecliptic.&#8221;
This globe was to be &#8220;so adjusted as to exhibit not only
the risings and the settings of the stars in all ages and in all
latitudes, but the other phenomena likewise, that depend
upon the motion of the diurnal axis round the annual axis.&#8221;
From what is stated in this paper one is led to associate his
idea with that of Cassini, to which attention was directed
above. If, however, such a globe was constructed as that referred
to in this scientific address it is not now known. Five
of his globes have been located, two of them undated, and
three of them dated 1793, which, if the correct date of issue,
it will be noted, is more than fifty years after his death. A
pair of his globes may be found in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale
of Paris undated. These are reported as having a diameter
of about 40 cm. They are furnished with brass meridian
circles, with horizon circles of wood, and each with a wooden
base. The dedication reads: &#8220;Philosopho ac Geometrae
summo Do Isaaco Newton, equiti, Regalis Societatis Londini,
ad scientias promovendas institutae, Praesidi dignissimo,
ejusdemque consilio et sodalibus hos Globos qua par
est humilitate D.D. C. Johannes Senex. London.&#8221; &#8220;To the
great philosopher and geometrician Sir Isaac Newton,
Knight, most worthy President of the Royal Society of
London, for the promotion of knowledge, and to the Committee
and Members of the same Society these globes with
befitting humility are dedicated by C. John Senex. London.&#8221;152
Further descriptive details of these globes it has not been
possible to obtain.

The Biblioteca Real of Madrid possesses a terrestrial
globe by Senex (Fig. 122), which bears the title legend, &#8220;A
new and most correct Globe of the Earth laid down from
the latest observations from the most judicious astronomers,
navigators, &amp; travelers, by John Senex, F. R. S. Now made
and sold by Dudley Adams (only)136 with all the latest discoveries
together with many new improvements etc. 1793.&#8221;
This globe has a diameter of about 40 cm., is furnished
with a broad band which serves as a horizon circle, a meridian
circle of brass within which it is made to revolve, and a
tripod base. Its three fluted support columns are strengthened
in their position by three curved iron braces which
carry at their juncture a short carved post, through a slot
in which the brass meridian is movable. While the surface
of the sphere is somewhat injured, being crossed by numerous
cracks, the engraved map is fairly legible in all of its
parts.

The British Museum likewise possesses one of Senex&#8217;s
terrestrial globes, which seems to be practically like that to
be found in the Madrid Library.

It will have been noted that many of those reputed to
have been globe makers in these early years did not actually
apply themselves to the constructive mechanical work, this
being passed over to skilled artisans, to workers in metal
and wood, to engravers and to mathematical instrument
makers, who, if possessing generally recognized ability, often
insisted on having their names associated in the author
legends with the real authors of the globes. Nicolas Bion
(1652-1733) may be cited as an excellent example of such
a skilful workman, achieving in his day great distinction as
a globe maker.137 He seems not to have thought of himself
as one meriting special honors as geographer, cartographer
or astronomer (Fig. 123). By reason of his marked abilities,
exhibited in the manufacture of mathematical instruments,
153he was honored by his royal patron with the title Engineer
of the King for Mathematical Instruments. Through his
principal work,138 a treatise on the construction and uses of
globes in which the subject is treated in both a theoretical
and a practical manner, he is entitled to rank with the leaders
of the century in this particular field of scientific endeavor.
True to the spirit of the age Bion gave much thought
to the idea of reform in the matter of globe construction,
especially in the matter of fashioning globe gores and their
attachment to the surface of the sphere. He seems to have
prospered in his business, and we are told by his son that
he constructed numerous armillary spheres, likewise many
terrestrial and celestial globes of various sizes. Reference
is made above to a task assigned to him by the great
astronomer, Cassini.139

A few of the globes of this distinguished man have been
located. Fiorini reports140 that one of his celestial globes may
be found in the private library of Count Malvezzi de&#8217;
Medici of Bologna, having a diameter of about 32 cm. Its
twelve gores have been cut at latitude 70 degrees both
north and south, the polar spaces being covered by four
sectors instead of by the usual circular disc. The globe is
made to revolve on its equatorial axis, not on the axis of
the ecliptic. It has a simple mounting, including a meridian
circle of brass and a horizon circle of wood. Star names are
given in French and in Latin. The dedication reads, &#8220;D&eacute;di&eacute;
et pr&eacute;sent&eacute; &agrave; Monseigneur le Dauphin par son tr&egrave;s humble
et tr&egrave;s ob&eacute;issant Bion,&#8221; but there appears to be some uncertainty
about the date, which is probably between 1700 and
1710. There is one of Bion&#8217;s terrestrial globes dated 1712
and dedicated to &#8220;Monseigneur le Duc de Berry,&#8221; in the
Istituto tecnico of Florence, which is reported to be in a
good state of preservation. Loxodromic lines are drawn on
the map in accord with the best practices of the time, which
radiate from wind or compass roses, one being placed on the
equator and one at latitude 35 degrees south. A third terrestrial154
globe made by Bion may be found in the Osservatorio
Astronomico of Rome, which is wanting both dedication
and place of publication.

The Osservatorio Astronomico also possesses a fine armillary
sphere, the work of Carmelo Cartilia,141 the diameter of
whose largest or meridian circle is about 26 cm. It is described
by a former director of the observatory as being made
of brass, and a companion of a globe constructed by Bion,
having a similar mounting. The equatorial circle, the tropics,
and the colures have the usual graduation. The ecliptic consists
of a band 4 cm. in width, having engraved on its surface
the signs of the zodiac and the days of the months. At
the north pole is attached an hour circle with index. At the
common center of the circles is a small ball 27 mm. in diameter
representing the earth, through which the axis of the
ecliptic passes. Around this small ball is adjusted a circle
on which is engraved the word &#8220;Luna.&#8221; There is an additional
small circle which represents the course of the sun,
and attached to this is a silvered ball to represent that
luminary. Circles are provided representing the planets, on
which we find such names as &#8220;Marti,&#8221; &#8220;Giove,&#8221; &#8220;Saturno,&#8221;
and circles around the sun representing the course of the
planets Mercury and Venus. On one of the supporting arms
of the sphere is the author and date legend, reading, &#8220;Carmelus
Cartilia et Francalancia Siculus fecit Taurini anno
d&ntilde;i 1720.&#8221;

Mattheus Seutter (1678-1756) was a map and globe
maker of this period, whose activities centered in the city of
Augsburg.142 His early training as engraver was received in
the establishment of Johann Baptista Homann in the city
of N&uuml;rnberg, but in the year 1707 he established himself
in his native city, Augsburg, setting up an independent business
for the production of maps, globes, and mathematical
instruments. Seutter holds his place in the history of cartography
not so much by reason of the high quality of the
work done as by reason of the quantity.143 The number of
155maps, large and small, battle plans and city plans, charts
geneological, chronological, and heraldic, which he published
may be counted by the hundreds, the majority being modified
copies of maps and charts which others had previously
issued. As a reward for the dedication of his large atlas to
the Emperor Charles VI, issued in the year 1725, he was
named &#8220;Imperial Geographer,&#8221; a title which had been held
by Homann until his death in the year 1727.

Following the practice of the more prominent map makers
of the period, Seutter turned his attention to globe construction,
and not a few examples of his work can still be found.
Some of his globes were of large size, having a diameter of
about 160 cm. The terrestrial as well as the celestial globe
balls he covered with twelve engraved sections, or twice
twelve, these being cut at the line of the equator, and at latitude
sixty-seven both north and south, the polar space being
covered, as was usual, with a circular cap or disc. The mountings
of these globes consist of a wooden meridian circle and
a graduated wooden horizon circle, having each on the upper
surface the usual concentric rings with the names of the
months, the names and signs of the zodiacal constellations,
and the names of the principal winds, the whole being supported
by two semicircles attached below to a single columnar
base 28 cm. in length. A brief author legend reads,
&#8220;Globus terrestris juxta recentissimas observation: et navigation:
peritissimor: Geograph: delineat. cura et sumptibus
Matth. Seutteri Calcogr: August.&#8221; &#8220;Terrestrial globe according
to the most recent observations and voyages of the
most skilled geographers. Made by the labor and at the
expense of Mattheus Seutter renowned engraver.&#8221;

The maps on these globes present no features of special
scientific value, the author following in the main the best
contemporary geographical and astronomical records. It
should, however, be noted that he introduced an improvement
in the construction and printing of the circular polar
discs. To the end of remedying the difficulty in attaching156
this part of the covering, having observed, as others, that
the paper would expand with the application of paste, and
could therefore not be adjusted with the strictest accuracy
and nicety, he conceived the idea of cutting from this disc
a very small section or small sections, so that when it was
applied to the sphere after being moistened with the paste
the amount of stretching was sufficient to cover the space.
In other words, he made his circular disc one of 350 degrees
instead of one having the full 360 degrees. In this connection,
it might be noted that the quality of the paper was an
element always to be taken into account in calculating the
amount of expansion after moistening.

A pair of Seutter&#8217;s globes may be found in the Biblioteca
Comunale of Macerata. A copy of the terrestrial is reported
in 1892 to have been in the private library of Professor
Maximilian Tono of Venice, a pair in the Museo Astronomico
of Rome (Figs. 124, 125) and also in this museum
may be found a complete set of the gores for one of his
terrestrial as well as a set for one of his celestial globes, but
which by Professor Jacoli of Venice have been thought to
be reprints and not originals. A copy of the celestial globe
may be found in the Biblioteca Universitario of Urbino.

Robert Morden,144 active in London in the closing years of
the seventeenth and early years of the eighteenth century
as map and globe maker, seems, however, not to have won
for himself a place of particular prominence, his maps not
being held in especially high repute. He was for some time
associated with Thomas Cockrill at &#8220;The Sign of the Atlas&#8221;
in Cornhill. Morden, however, published a small work on
geography and navigation in the year 1702, in which he
attempted to set forth the value attaching to globes for
those interested in the general subject of which he treated
in his work.145 While his map publications are numerous, it
has been possible to locate only the gores of one of his
globes, which gores may be found in the British Museum. Of
the twelve sections which made up a complete set for
157covering a sphere about 35 cm. in diameter, but nine remain,
three having disappeared.

Jean Antoine Nollet, a French physicist (1700-1770),
was a man of science held in high esteem in his day.146 In his
early years he entered the College of Clermont, later studied
philosophy at the University of Paris, where, against the
wishes of his parents, he finally turned his attention to the
study of the natural sciences, particularly to experimental
physics. Early in his career he was honored with membership
in the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris and in other
similar organizations in Europe. In the year 1739 he was
called to the Court of Sardinia, where he gave lessons in
physics to the Duke of Savoy. Later he was called to the
University of Turin, and was here especially honored by
having his name associated with those who were the founders
of the institution. In the year 1753 he was called to the
chair of physics at the College of Navarre, which position
he so acceptably filled that he received the title Master of
Physics and of Natural History for the Royal Children of
France. His published works, which are very numerous,
treat of his studies in the physical sciences, particularly in
the field of electricity.

Nollet&#8217;s instruments, made for use in the study of the
physical sciences, included terrestrial and celestial globes,
six of which have been located, dated 1728 and 1730. The
spheres are of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;, having each a diameter of about
35 cm.147 The engraved maps covering the spheres are composed
of twelve gores, which are cut at the line of the equator
but extend to the poles, omitting therefore the usual
polar circular discs. Each is furnished with a horizon circle
of wood, on the surface of which is the usual paper covering
with the names of the principal directions, of the zodiacal
constellations, and of the names of the months in concentric
circles. Each also has a graduated meridian circle, the whole
resting on a base of four turned and rather artistically
fashioned columns.158

His terrestrial globes have the following title: &#8220;Globe
terrestre dress&eacute; sur les observations les plus nouvelles et le
plus exactes approuv&eacute;es par Mrs de l&#8217;Acad&eacute;mie Royale des

circles are drawn on the globe at intervals of five degrees,
the principal ones, including the equator, the tropics, and
polar circles, being made especially prominent. The prime
meridian, passing through the Island of Ferro, is designated
&#8220;premier m&eacute;ridien de l&#8217;Isle Fer. D&eacute;claration du Roi Louis
XIII du Juil. 1634.&#8221;

circle and the ecliptic, as represented on the map, are graduated,
but the tropics and the polar circles are merely drawn
as continuous black lines. The figures representing the several159
Ptolemaic constellations are artistically drawn and retain
much of their original color, which was added by hand
at the time of construction.

Of Nollet&#8217;s globes a pair may be found in the Biblioteca
Maldotti of Guastalla, a pair in the Seminario Vescovile of
Mondovi, a copy of the terrestrial in the Archivo Fenaroli
of Brescia, and a copy of the celestial in the Museo Astronomico
of Rome.

Johann Gabriel Doppelmayr (1671-1750) was one of
N&uuml;rnberg&#8217;s famous eighteenth-century mathematicians who
was especially distinguished as writer, translator, editor, and
teacher.148 A part of his early training he received at the Egedian
Gymnasium of his native town, where from 1704 to
the time of his death he was actively engaged as teacher of
mathematics and physics. In the year 1696 we find him
registered as a student of law at the University of Altdorf,
though turning betimes with much enthusiasm to the study
of mathematics under the direction of Joh. Christoph Sturm.
In the year 1700, after some months passed at the University
of Halle, he determined to add to his equipment for his
life work such experience as could be gained through travel;
accordingly he visited in turn the more important cities of
his own country and those of Holland and England, spending
in his travels a period of ten years. Among his more important
publications may be mentioned a translation of the
&#8216;Astronomy&#8217; of Thomas Street,149 a work by Bion in a German
translation from the French, which at the same time
he enlarged.150 His &#8216;Einleitung zur Geographie,&#8217; appearing
as an introduction to Homann&#8217;s &#8216;Atlas&#8217; issued in the
year 1714, and his &#8216;Atlas Coelestis,&#8217; issued in the year 1742,
are among his more important works original in character,
which he published on the subject of geography and astronomy.
His principal work is his &#8216;Notes&#8217; on the mathematicians
and artists of N&uuml;rnberg.151

It was doubtless through his connection with the cartographical
establishment of Homann that he felt induced to160
undertake the construction of his globes, examples of which
exist dated 1728. In the collection belonging to The Hispanic
Society of America (Fig. 126) there may be found a
fine example of his terrestrial globes, which has a diameter
of about 32 cm. Over a carefully prepared hollow wooden
ball twelve gores, cut at the line of the equator and five
degrees from each pole, have been pasted. The small polar
spaces lying between latitudes 85 degrees, both north and
south, are covered by circular discs, having a diameter of
but ten degrees, on the one is engraved &#8220;Polus Arcticus&#8221; and
on the other &#8220;Polus Antarcticus.&#8221; The globe is furnished
with a narrow graduated meridian of brass within which
the sphere turns on its polar axis, a horizon circle of wood,
circular on its inner edge but octagonal on the outer. The
engraved paper strip containing the zodiacal figures, calendar,
and directions, has practically disappeared. The base
support consists of four small turned columns of wood, attached
at their lower extremities by crossbars over which is
a circular plate, provision having been made for insertion
into its surface of a compass, which instrument, however,
has disappeared. Excepting slight damage to its horizon
circle the globe may be said to be in an excellent state of
preservation. In a neat cartouch in the North Pacific is the
title legend reading, &#8220;Globus terrestris in quo locorum insigniorum

times by the labor of John Gabriel Doppelmayr, mathematician,

John George Puschner, engraver of N&uuml;rnberg152 in the year
1728.&#8221; An interesting legend in the South Pacific tells us
161&#8220;Exprimit Globus hic noster quicquid Geographia recens ex

latest geographical information furnishes from the trustworthy
observations both as regards the location of new
places and the extent of the new lands and seas. The first
meridian passes through the Island of Ferro in the Canary
Islands (called the Fortunate Islands), which is the most
western point and from which the meridian of Paris, according
to the testimony of the most approved observations
differs by 22 degrees, while that of N&uuml;rnberg differs by 28
degrees and 40 minutes.&#8221; Around this legend are the engraved
portraits of famous explorers, &#8220;Mart. Bohemus

Fig. 126. Terrestrial Globe of Johann Gabriel Doppelmayr, 1728.

While the representation of the world is not so detailed in
certain respects as we find, for example, on the Valk globes,
there nevertheless is the evidence that the author wished to
include such information as in his judgment should be recorded.
There are records of interest in the newly explored
regions of America. California is laid down as a peninsula.
In about latitude 41 degrees there appears a Drake record
reading &#8220;Pt. F. Drack.&#8221; &#8220;Fretum Anian&#8221; is represented at
latitude 45 degrees. Sixty degrees to the west of this is the
somewhat indefinitely indicated coast line of &#8220;Terra Borealis
incognita detecta Dom. Ioh. de Gama,&#8221; this being separated
from the coast of &#8220;Kamtzadalia Terra Jedso&#8221; by &#8220;Fretum
Vries.&#8221; The recently explored regions in the Far East,162
as in Australia, New Zealand, Van Diemen&#8217;s Land,&mdash;each,
however, being represented as imperfectly known,&mdash;are
made very prominent. There are scarcely any map records
of the period more interesting than are those to be found
on this globe of Doppelmayr&#8217;s. The routes of Magellan,
1519; Nord, 1600; Roggeveen, 1722; Dampier, 1700;
Tasman, 1624; Loys, 1708; Lemaire, 1616, are all laid
down. In latitude 60 degrees south and longitude 300 degrees
we find, &#8220;Port detecta per Fr. Drack,&#8221; and again in
latitude 67 degrees south and longitude 310, &#8220;I. deton detecta
per F. Drack.&#8221;

To accompany his terrestrial globe, Doppelmayr issued
a celestial globe bearing the same date. A title legend on the
latter reads, &#8220;Globus coelestis novus Stellarum fixarum loca
secundum celeberrimi astronomi Dantiscicani Joannis Hevelii
Catalogum ad annum 1730 compl. sistens opera Joh.
Gabr. Doppelmaieri M. P. P. exhibitus a Johanne Georgio

celestial globe giving the location of the fixed stars according
to the record of the celebrated Danish astronomer Johannes
Hevelius conforming to the year 1730, by the labor
of Johannes Gabriel Doppelmayr, mathematician, professor,
publisher, engraved by Johannes George Puschner, engraver
of N&uuml;rnberg, in the year 1728.&#8221; In size and in general
features of construction these globes seem to agree,
being scientifically and carefully constructed. A pair of
these globes may be found in the Biblioteca Capitolare of
Verona, a pair in the Geographisches Institute of G&ouml;ttingen,
a copy of the celestial in the Mathematical Salon of Dresden,
a copy of the terrestrial in the Museo di Fisica of Pavia,
a pair dated 1728 in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum
of N&uuml;rnberg, a pair dated 1736, 20 cm. in diameter, and
three copies each of his globes issued in 1730, 20 cm. in
diameter, and a celestial globe dated 1730 and 20 cm. in
diameter, in Dresden. (Fig. 126a.)

Fiorini notes the existence of a large terrestrial globe belonging163 to the Marquis Luigi Cusani,153 which probably was
constructed in the early eighteenth century, perhaps before
1730, by order of Cardinal Agostino Cusani. The globe, unsigned
and undated, is of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;, having a diameter
of about 120 cm. The paper gores with which the sphere is
covered are not all of like form, but all are cut at the line of
the equator and at latitude 80 both north and south, the
usual circular disc being provided for covering the polar
areas. On its surface the map has been drawn by hand, and
practically all of the geographical names recorded are in
the Italian language. The globe is mounted on a solid base,
having a heavy horizon circle of wood, which is graduated,
and on its surface are the names and the signs of the several
zodiacal constellations, the names of the months and of the
principal winds or directions. The meridian circle, within
which the sphere revolves, is of brass and is graduated. It is
reported to be in a good state of preservation.

The Biblioteca Comunale of Siena possesses two anonymous
terrestrial globes, according to report of Fiorini, the
one having a map in manuscript, the other having an engraved
map.154 The first of these, unsigned and undated,
probably of the second quarter of the century, has a diameter
of about 120 cm. The sphere is of wood, the surface of which
is covered with mastic or varnish, and on this the map has
been drawn. It is constructed to revolve within its simple
mounting of wood by means of a crank. The title legend
reads &#8220;Globe terrestre Dress&eacute; selon les observations de
l&#8217;Acad. Royale de Paris et des autres Acad. plus c&eacute;l&eacute;br&eacute;s
d&#8217;Europe.&#8221; &#8220;Terrestrial globe constructed according to the
observations of the Royal Academy of Paris and of other
Academies the most celebrated in Europe.&#8221; In addition to
the above legend one finds the following inscription: &#8220;On a
pris la longitude des villes principales des Tables de Mur
Philippe de La Hire. Les autres villes ou il n&#8217; a point d&#8217;observations
sont icy places en la m&ecirc;me distance des villes
principales dans la quelle on les voit dans les cartes de M.164
Guillaume de l&#8217;Isle.&#8221; &#8220;The longitudes of the principal towns
have been taken from the tables of Mur Philippe de La
Hire.155 The other towns which have not been located from
observation are placed at the same distance from the principal
towns as they are located on the maps of M. Guillaume
de l&#8217;Isle.&#8221;

It seems probable that this globe was constructed in
France, and from the particular references to La Hire and
Delisle one may infer, as noted above, that it belongs to the
early eighteenth century. Parallels and meridians are drawn
on the surface of the globe at intervals of ten degrees, and
one conspicuous wind rose with sixteen radiating lines is
placed in latitude 30 degrees north and longitude 350 degrees
counting from the prime meridian, which passes
through the Island of Ferro. This globe, it is thought, came
to the Siena Library about the year 1810, at the time of
French rule in Tuscany, together with the library of the
Convent of S. Augustine, but how it came to have place in
the Augustine convent is unknown.

The second Sienese terrestrial globe, like the one just described,
probably belongs to about the same date.156 It has
the following legend conspicuously placed: &#8220;Globo terracqueo
corretto et accresciuto secondo le nuove scoperte. Anno
1744. In Roma nella Calcografia del R:C:A: al Pi&egrave; di
Marmo.&#8221; &#8220;Terrestrial globe corrected and enlarged according
to recent discoveries. 1744. In Rome in the engraving
establishment of R. C. A. at the foot of the marble.&#8221; The
globe ball is of wood, having a diameter of about 50 cm.
Additional information concerning this globe it has not been
possible to obtain. Copies of it may be found in the Biblioteca
Comunale of Imola, in that of Osimo, in that of
Savignano, and in the Seminario Vescovile of Ivrea.

Fig. 126b. Celestial Globe of Johann Puschner, 1730.

In the Museo di Strumenti Antichi of Florence there is
a well-preserved armillary sphere,157 having the usual large
circles the outer one measuring about 15 cm. in diameter,
of four lesser ones and of these there are two small ones
165representing the sun and the moon. The meridian and the
equator are graduated, as is likewise the ecliptic, having
engraved on its surface the names of the principal winds
in the Italian language, and the ecliptic having engraved
in Latin on its surface the names of the signs of the zodiac.
On one of the arms which supports the horizon circle is the
author and date legend, reading, &#8220;Joseph Torricelli F. Florentiae
1739.&#8221; Fiorini thinks it probable that Joseph was a
relative of Evangelista Torricelli, inventor of the barometer.

Pietro Maria da Vinchio, a monk of the order of St.
Francis, deserves a word of special praise for the skill with
which he labored as a map and globe maker about the middle
of the eighteenth century.158 He seems to have followed in
the main the work of Moroncelli, and that of the unknown
maker of the Cusani globe, yet he should be counted a workman
possessing greater technical ability. His first pair of
globes have a diameter of about 60 cm. The mounting consists
of a meridian and a horizon circle of wood, the whole
resting on a somewhat elaborate wooden base. The gores
with which he covered his spheres are in each instance eighteen
in number, but each gore has been cut into three sections&mdash;at
the parallel of 40 degrees, both north and south,
and also at the parallel of 80 degrees, the polar spaces having
the usual circular disc covering. The terrestrial globes
have represented on their surfaces the polar and the tropical
circles, also the ecliptic and the equator, together with the
several parallels and meridians at intervals of ten degrees.
Artistic wind roses are placed at each of the equinoctial
points, each with points representing the eight principal
directions. The title legend reads, &#8220;Globus terrestris juxta
geographicas mappas novissime editas accurate descriptus,
in quibus, exactiori observatione praemissa, errores multiplices
sunt emendati, qui in veteri geographia detinebantur
impressi. F. Petri Mariae a Vinchio opus et labor 1739.&#8221;
&#8220;Terrestrial globe accurately delineated according to the
most recent geographical maps in which, by more exact166
observations, numerous errors are corrected which continued
to be printed in the old geography. Fra Peter Maria a
Vinchio, his work and labor, 1739.&#8221;

The celestial globe, similar in its construction in practically
every respect to the preceding, has its system of
circles represented according to the equatorial system instead
of the ecliptic system. All of the Ptolemaic constellations are
represented, the figures of the several constellations being
very artistically painted. Its dedication reads, &#8220;Ill&#772;mo ac
Rev&#772;mo D. D. Petro Hieronymo Caravadossi Episcopo Casalensi
Ordinis Praedicatorum parvum hoc Firmamentum
dicatum a F. Petro Maria de Vinchio Ord. Min. Stric. Obser.
operis auctor. 1745.&#8221; &#8220;Dedicated to the Illustrious and
Reverend D. D. Peter Hieronymus Caravadossi Bishop of
Casale of the Preaching Friars, by Fra. Peter Maria de
Vinchio of the Strict Minorite Order, who is the author of
this work, in the year 1745.&#8221; The pair just described may
be found in the Biblioteca Seminario Maggiore of Casale
Monferrato. Fiorini is of the opinion that these globes, presented
to the learned Father Pietro Girolamo Caravadossi of
the Preaching Friars, Bishop of Casale, must have been
given by him to the seminary library, that they might serve
in the education of the priests. It is even probable that the
two globes came to the library by a direct clause in the will
of the bishop, since it is known that he bequeathed to the
same library all of his books and an annual sum, that the
library might be used not only by the members of the seminary
but by the general public as well.

Not long after the completion of the pair just described,
da Vinchio undertook the construction of a second and
larger pair. These he began in the year 1746 and completed
in the year 1751. These globes have a diameter of about 105
cm. Like the preceding they are of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;. Each is
furnished with a meridian and a horizon circle of wood,
and a somewhat elaborate supporting base. On the parchment
covering of the spheres the maps have been drawn by167
hand. On the terrestrial globe the meridians and the parallels
are represented at intervals of ten degrees. Place names, the
names of the seas and of the rivers are in the Italian language
or in the language of the country claiming possession.
Very many of the discoveries are referred to in appropriate
legends. The title and date legend reads &#8220;D. O. M. Globus
terraqueus Juxta geographicas mappas novissime editas accurate
descriptus, in quibus, exactiori observatione praemissa,
longitudinum, latitudinumque punctis verius universe
compertis, errores multiplices sunt emendati, qui in veteri
geographia detinebantur impressi. Inferius scripti mens,
labor, ars, et opus. F. Petrus Maria a Vinchio. In Conventu
S. M. de Templo Casalis annis 1746-1747-1748.&#8221; &#8220;D. O. M.
Terrestrial globe accurately described according to the
latest geographical maps in which by a more exact observation
and by a truer location of the points of longitude and
latitude many errors have been corrected which continued
to be printed in the old geographies. What follows is the
work and labor of Fra. Peter Maria a Vinchio, made in the
Convent of Santa Maria at the Temple in Casale in the years
1746-1747-1748.&#8221;

The celestial globe is similarly mounted, having a title
legend which reads &#8220;Globus coelestis Circa quem spectabiliores,
magisque obviae stellae juxta dispositionem et situm,
longitudinis scilicet ac latitudinis grad&#363;, in quo ab Auctore
Universi in Firmamento sunt positae, dispositae inspiciuntur;

O. M. S. O. Anno 1750.&mdash;Opifex.&mdash;1751.&#8221; &#8220;Celestial globe
in which are to be seen more clearly and more distinctly set
forth the stars according to their places and positions, that is,
their degrees of longitude and latitude where they have been
placed in the firmament by the Creator of the Universe. To
which have been added the figures of the constellations idealized
by the poets, brought to earth and assigned their true168
places by astronomers. F. Maria a Vinchio of the Strict
Order of the Minorites maker. In the year 1750-1751.&#8221;

The figures of the constellations are well drawn and are
colored, the names of these constellations being given in
Latin. This pair of Maria&#8217;s globes may be found in the
Biblioteca Municipale of Alessandria, in which town he
probably lived at the time of their construction, and probably
at the convent of the Capuchin monks.

Prefixed to his &#8216;Select Mechanical Exercises,&#8217; first issued
in the year 1773, James Ferguson (1710-1776), Scotch
experimental philosopher, physicist, and astronomer (Fig.
127), gives us a most interesting specimen of autobiography.159
It is a remarkable story of native genius and of self-instruction.
Herein he tells us how the child of poor parents, with
an unquenchable desire for scientific knowledge, proceeded
in his early years, step by step, until at length he attained
to a position of great renown, not only in his own country
but as well in other lands. He tells of his early interest in
simple mechanical problems and of his attempts at the solution
of the same, but what is of special interest here, he
relates how it was he became interested in geography and in
the construction of globes and orreries. From a description
of a globe he had found in &#8216;Gordon&#8217;s Geographical Grammar,&#8217;
as he tells us, &#8220;I made a globe in three weeks turning
the ball thereof out of a piece of wood.&#8221; This he covered
with paper and delineated thereon the map of the world.
He was happy to find, as he says, &#8220;that by using the globe,
which was the first I ever saw, I could solve the problems.&#8221;
In his second attempt at globe making, his boyish ingenuity
particularly exhibited itself. Finding two large globular
stones on the top of a neighbor&#8217;s gate-posts, he painted on
one of these, with oil colors, a map of the terrestrial globe,
and on the other a map of the celestial, from a planisphere of
the stars which he had copied on paper from a celestial globe
belonging to a neighboring gentleman. &#8220;The poles of the
painted globes stood toward the poles of the heavens. On
169each the twenty-four hours were placed around the equinoctial
so as to show the time of day when the sun shone
out, by the boundary where the half of the globe at any
time enlightened by the sun was parted from the other half
in the shade: the enlightened parts of the terrestrial globe
answering to the like enlightened parts of the earth at all
times: so that whenever the sun shone on the globe one might
see to what place the sun was then rising, to what place it
was setting, and all the places where it was then day or
night, throughout the earth.&#8221;

Fig. 127. Portrait of James Ferguson.

Turning his attention especially to the movements of the
stars, he contrived an orrery to show the motions of the
earth and the moon, of the sun and the planets, both diurnal
and annual, and it was in his first literary attempt, published
in the year 1746, that he described &#8216;The Use of a
New Orrery.&#8217; Ferguson published many works on scientific
subjects, lectured extensively before learned societies, was
honored with the royal bounty of King George III, and
became a member of the Royal Society without initiatory
or annual fees.

Of globes constructed by Ferguson other than those he
contrived in his boyhood days, eight copies are known. In the
collection of The Hispanic Society of America (Fig. 127a),
there appears to be a unique example of his first published
globe work, constructed perhaps as early as the year 1750,
since it records the route followed by the Englishman, George
Anson, in circumnavigating the earth in his expedition or
expeditions of the years 1740-1744, and omits reference
to the expeditions of Captain Cook. The terrestrial globe,
a solid wooden ball, 7 cm. in diameter, is enclosed in a black
leather covering, on the inner surface of which is pasted an
engraved gore map of the celestial sphere. It appears to be
constructed as were those referred to by Moxon in his catalogue
of globes which were &#8220;made and sold by himself on
Ludgate Hill,&#8221; that is, &#8220;concave hemispheres of the Starry
Orb which serve for a case to a Terrestrial Globe of 3 inches170
in diameter, made portable for the Pocket.&#8221; The covering
of this Ferguson globe is made to open on the line of the
celestial equator. In a neat cartouch placed in the North
Pacific is the author and title legend reading, &#8220;A New
Globe of the Earth by James Ferguson.&#8221; The meridians are
drawn at intervals of fifteen degrees, the prime meridian
passing through Greenwich, and the parallels are drawn at
intervals of ten degrees, being graduated on the meridian
of 145 degrees west, excepting the tropics and the polar
circles, which are drawn in their proper latitudes, respectively
23&frac12; degrees from the equator and 23&frac12; degrees from
the poles. Ferguson followed such geographical records as
were laid down by Hondius in his world map of the year
1611, or by Greuter in his globe map of the year 1632 in the
North Pacific region, indicating there the existence of a
great expanse of ocean, between northwest North America
and northeast Asia. &#8220;Anian St.&#8221; is marked as separating a
somewhat indefinitely outlined coast from America. The
Antarctic continent is altogether omitted; the only inscription
appearing in that region is &#8220;The South Pole.&#8221; Geographical
names are as numerous as one could expect to
find them on a globe of such small dimensions.

Fig. 127a. Pocket Globe of James Ferguson, 1750 (?).

The figures on the celestial map pasted on the inner surface
of the terrestrial globe covering representing the several
constellations have been very artistically drawn. Both the
terrestrial and the celestial parts of this combination globe
are remarkably well preserved. A second and later example
of this Ferguson globe may be found in the Harvard
University Library, once belonging to Ebenezer Storer of
the class of 1747. It came into the possession of the University
in the year 1914. In addition to the globes of Ferguson,
just described, two pairs are known, dated each 1782,
subsequent to the author&#8217;s death, it will be noted, each having
a diameter of 30 cm. These are mounted in the usual manner
with wooden horizon and brass meridian circles, with support
base columns of wood. On the terrestrial globes English

171
is the language employed, while all names of the constellations
on the celestial globes are in Latin. As on the small
terrestrial globe in The Hispanic Society&#8217;s collection, the
route of Admiral Anson is indicated, omitting that of Captain
Cook, and numerous brief legends are given referring to
various geographical discoveries. One pair of these globes

NOTES

117 This society was founded in the year 1666 by Louis XIV, after the
model of the Royal Society of London. It was liberally endowed and supported,
its members devoting themselves to the science of physics, mathematics,
astronomy, botany, zoology, and medicine. The observatory, founded
in the year 1667, was an adjunct of the society.

119 Not that there is less of interest in physical, in commercial, in descriptive
geography, but that there is a decided tendency in this day to stress
what is sometimes called human geography, which consists in emphasizing
the relation of geographical study to real life.

120 This work appears to have established his reputation. In the year 1702
he became a member of the Academy, not as a geographer&mdash;this department
was not established until the year 1730&mdash;but as an astronomer under Cassini.

121 Sandler, op. cit. This was an error having its origin in Ptolemy&#8217;s geography,
as set down in the Ptolemy maps. The two most significant errors
in the Ptolemaic cartography were (a) the representation of the Indian
Ocean as an enclosed sea; (b) the too great extension in longitude given
to the Mediterranean Sea. A correction of the first of these errors followed
quickly after the discovery of the sea route to the Indies of the East. As a
result incident to the second error the Asiatic regions were extended much172
too far eastward, the maps as late as the seventeenth century showing the
coast of China to lie at least twenty-five degrees too far in that direction.
The invention of the telescope in the first decade of the seventeenth century
and of the pendulum clock about the middle of the century made
possible a more accurate determination of the location of places, and an
improvement in map construction soon followed. See also Wolf, Geschichte,
pp. 355-362; 369-373.

122 Wolf, op. cit., pp. 400-403. This came to be but one of the many
methods employed in the effort to determine longitude. One of the most
interesting and most recent is that in which wireless telegraphy has been
called into service. See Hoogewerff, Capt. J.A. Washington-Paris Longitude

126 &#8220;Gassendi, Pierre.&#8221; (In: Nouvelle biographie.) Gassendi achieved distinction
for his works on astronomical subjects. In the year 1645 he was
appointed Professor of Mathematics in the Coll&egrave;ge Royal of Paris, a position
he held with interruptions until his death.

127 The term &#8220;Precession of the Equinoxes,&#8221; as used in astronomy, refers
to the slow retrograde motion of the equinoctial point to the west, or contrary
to the order of the signs of the zodiac, this precession being estimated
by Hipparchus to be one degree in one hundred years; in sixty-nine years
by Ptolemy; in sixty-six years by Albategnius; in seventy years by Cassini,
but it is now estimated to be one degree in about seventy and one half
years. For one complete revolution of this equinoctial point through the
twelve signs of the zodiac Hipparchus estimated a period of 36,000 years
would be required; according to Ptolemy a period of 24,840 years; according
to Albategnius 23,760 years; according to Cassini 25,200 years; whereas
the period is now estimated to be a little more than 25,800 years. An important
consequence of the precession of the equinoxes lies in the fact that the
zodiacal constellations do not agree with the signs with which they coincided
in ancient times, i.e., in the beginnings of astronomical science. The
first star of Aries, which at the time of Eudoxus was at the intersection of
the equator and the ecliptic, or at the equinoctial colure, has continued to
increase its position in longitude. At the time of Ptolemy this was 6 degrees
40 minutes. Its longitude is now about 31 degrees, which places it entirely
out of its original sign.

subject may be mentioned, M&eacute;thode pour trouver la diff&eacute;rence des

Globes and Globe Makers of the Second
Half of the Eighteenth Century

Few globe makers of striking distinction in this period.&mdash;An apparent
decrease in scientific interest in globes, but an apparent
increase in popular interest.&mdash;Gilles and Didier Robert de
Vaugondy.&mdash;The work of Desnos.&mdash;Globes of Gian Francesco
Costa the Venetian.&mdash;Globes of Akerman and Akrel.&mdash;The
French globe makers Rigobert Bonne and Lalande.&mdash;Charles
Messier and Jean Fortin.&mdash;Globes of George Adams the
Elder, of George Adams the Younger, and of Dudley
Adams.&mdash;Small globes of Nathaniel Hill.&mdash;The work of Innocente
Alessandri and Pietro Scaltaglia.&mdash;Charles Francis Delamarche.&mdash;Manuscript
globes of Vincenzo Rosa.&mdash;Geographer
and globe maker Giovanni Maria Cassini.&mdash;Globes of William
Cary.

DURING the second half of the eighteenth century
there is a continued interest in globe construction,
yet the period is not one which is at all striking
by reason of the good quality of the work done in this field.
Since the latter part of the sixteenth century and the early
part of the seventeenth, when, as has been noted, globes
were so generally thought to be an essential part of a seaman&#8217;s
outfit of navigating instruments, there had been a
remarkable improvement in the construction of sailors&#8217;
charts resulting from carefully devised methods for the
determination of geographical position and the employment
of the results in map construction. The plane or sheet chart176
was again regarded as a more convenient, a more handy
guide in navigation than was the globe. If plane chart
making had improved so had plane map making. There
must, however, have been a considerable popular interest
in globes, judging from the number which we know were
constructed, and from the number of publications issued
which were intended to point out the particular value
attaching to globes in geographical and astronomical instruction,
to explain their construction, and to indicate the character
of the problems which, by their use, could be easily
solved. The interest in such objects in this period, perhaps
we may say, was rather more extensive than intensive,
having more of a popular than of a scientific character.

Among the most prominent French map and globe makers
of this period were Gilles Robert de Vaugondy (1688-1766)
and Didier Robert de Vaugondy (1723-1786), father and
son, reference usually being made to these men in geographical
literature under the name &#8220;Robert&#8221; or &#8220;Vaugondy.&#8221;160
Gilles, the grandson of Nicolas Sanson,161 who had achieved
first rank among geographers in his day for his maps and
atlases, proved himself to be a worthy member of the family.
He doubtless owed his earliest enthusiasm for geographical
science to an inheritance of the maps, atlases, and other
geographical publications of the grandfather, many of which
he reissued, adding to the same his own valuable and independent
work. Didier seems to have possessed talents none
the less brilliant than were those exhibited by the father,
and upon him, in succession, the king conferred the title
Royal Geographer. In addition to his issue of maps and
atlases, the father, often referred to simply as Robert de
Vaugondy, became interested in the construction of globes,
issuing his first pair, which must have been of small size,
in the year 1751, in which work he doubtless was assisted
by the son. The king, it appears, being so well pleased with
these, directed the construction of others of larger dimensions,
and in the same year a pair was issued, each globe177
having a diameter of about 48 cm.162 In the same preface163 it
is stated that the king gave orders for a terrestrial globe
with map in manuscript, the same to have a diameter of
about six feet, and the author further notes that &#8220;when
this work shall have been completed and presented to His
Majesty, I shall give an explanation of the work which I
shall have been obliged to put upon the mechanical construction
of the ball, also a description of the allegorical
ornaments which will adorn the globe support, and a description
of the geographical labor I shall have expended.&#8221;
There appearing no later reference to this particular work,
it seems hardly probable that it was ever actually undertaken.
Delamarche gives us to understand that the king
could not have been altogether pleased with Vaugondy&#8217;s
first work, observing that while &#8220;it was done to the satisfaction
of the Prince, he would have received the compensation
due his talents and painstaking labor if the order of
the king had been followed.&#8221;164 Wherein he failed we do not
know. It may have been this fact which discouraged him in
his thought of undertaking the larger work.

In the construction of his globes having a diameter of
48 cm. he was assisted by the engravers, De la Haye and
Gobin, the results being the production of a terrestrial and a
celestial globe map of superior excellence.

While it has not been possible to obtain photographs of
any of the Vaugondy globes, his map of the world dated
1751 is doubtless much the same as his globe map, presenting
geographical records as he thought proper to present
them, including a representation of the route of a number
of the recent exploring expeditions.

Copies of his globes of the year 1751 cannot now be
located, but reproductions of the same, the terrestrial dated
1773 and the celestial dated 1764, may be found in the
Biblioteca Governativa of Lucca, in the Biblioteca Real of
Caserta, and a copy of the celestial in the Osservatorio
Patriarcale of Venice. Shortly after the first issue of the178
globes in the year 1751 Vaugondy constructed other pairs,
each having a diameter of 23 cm. These are dated 1754,
copies of which may be found in the Biblioteca Palatina of
Parma (two copies of the celestial), in the Pinacoteca
Quirini of Venice, and a pair in the Palazzo of the Marquis
of Spinola of Tassarolo.

L. C. (Pierre-Joseph ?) Desnos, a contemporary and an
intimate friend of Didier Robert de Vaugondy, was a
Danish geographer of distinction, winning for himself in
early life the favor of his king and the title Geographical
Engineer.165 A considerable number of his maps are known,
and especially worthy of note is his atlas, titled &#8216;Atlas G&eacute;n&eacute;ral
et &Eacute;l&eacute;mentaire,&#8217; dated Paris, 1778, there being other
editions of the same with modifications. It has been possible
to locate a few of his globes. The first, a celestial, appears
to have been issued as early as the year 1750, a copy of
which may be found in the Liceo of Reggio, as there may
also be found in the same collection a Desnos terrestrial
globe dated 1760. These have each a diameter of about 22
cm. and are reputed to be in an excellent state of preservation.
On the brass meridian circle of the second, one reads,
&#8220;Se fait et se vendre chez Desnos rue St. Julien le pauvre
1753,&#8221; which legend suggests an issue of the same as early
as the date given, and this idea finds support in an engraved
legend referring to this particular issue as being one revised
and corrected. There is additional support for the belief that
a pair was issued in the year 1753 in the fact that this date
appears on the base of the celestial globe. The Desnos maps
are all well engraved and, like others of the period, much
was made of indicating the routes of many of the famous
explorers, including a reference to the success of Bering as
follows, &#8220;Les Moscovites ont recouvr&eacute; ici en 1743 sur les
terres basses.&#8221; In this we have one of the very early references
to the Russian successes in this region.

Fig. 129a. Globe of L. C. Desnos, 1782.

In the year 1754 Desnos issued a pair of globes somewhat
larger in size, giving to them a diameter of about 26 cm.
179Copies of these globes may be found in the private library
of the Marquis Lalatta Costerbosa of Parma. In their general
features they resemble the previous edition, with every
evidence that the author wished to bring his records to date
and to make them quite as full as his space would allow,
noting in one of his inscriptions, &#8220;Nous n&#8217;avons trac&eacute; que
par des points la figure des terres que l&#8217;Admiral De Font&eacute;
d&eacute;taille dans se lettre que Mr. Delisle a r&eacute;du publique, en
attendant l&#8217;authenticit&eacute; de cette lettre, se que les relations
des nouvelles d&eacute;couvertes rendent probable.&#8221; In the year
1772, it appears, he issued a third edition, noting that he
had made use of the most recent observations of the Royal
Academy of Sciences of Paris, bringing his star records down
to the year 1770. Copies of this edition are in Piacenza.

Gian Francesco Costa, a Venetian engineer, architect, and
engraver, gave some attention to the construction of globes.166
In the year 1754 he prepared and issued, for the Venetian
Academy, a terrestrial and a celestial globe, each about 24
cm. in diameter, basing the former on the work of Delisle
and the latter on the observations and records of the English
astronomer, John Flamsteed.167 There is little of special value
attaching to the globes of Costa. They give merely the well-known
geographical and astronomical records of the day.
Copies of his celestial globe may be found in the Biblioteca
Municipale of Cagli and in the Osservatorio Astronomico of
Rome. Fiorini refers to a copy of the terrestrial as belonging
to the Biblioteca Universitorio of Urbino, and to one in the
private library of Canon Ettore Fronzi of Senigallia.

There is said to be a fine manuscript terrestrial globe,
dated 1756, in the private library of Professor Maximilian
Tono, director of the Osservatorio Patriarcale di S. Maria
della Salute in Venice. The ball is of wood, over which is a
coating of varnish, and on this a world map has been drawn
by hand. It appears to have been constructed merely for the
personal use of the maker, P. Francesco Grandi.

In Andrea Akerman we find a native of Sweden interested180
in the matter of globe making. Observing him to be one in
possession of commendable talents, the Academy of Sciences
of Stockholm, about the year 1750, granted to him a subsidy
for the establishment of a workshop in Upsala. Here
he undertook the construction of a terrestrial and of a celestial
globe. So successful was his enterprise that, we are told,
his productions found favor not only among those interested
in his field within his own country, but among those similarly
interested in Denmark, Germany, and Russia. Lalande
makes mention of his work published through the Geographical
Society of Upsala, dated 1776, noting that they had
a diameter of about 22 inches.168 A copy of his celestial globe
may be found in the Osservatorio Astronomico of Milan,
having a diameter of about 59 cm. It has an author and date
legend, reading &#8220;Globus coelestis ex Catalogo Brittanico et
De la Caillii observationibus ad annum 1800 cura Soc.
Cosmog. Upsal. delineatus ab Andrea Akerman Reg. S. S.
Apt. sculptore 1766.&#8221;

A pair of Akerman&#8217;s globes may also be found in the
Geographisches Institut of G&ouml;ttingen, the terrestrial dated
1759, and the celestial dated 1760 and dedicated to the
President of the Academy of Sciences by the Geographical
Society of Upsala. His globes, it appears, were reissued by
Frederick Akrel,169 an engraver who had assisted him in his
work. The reissue of the Akerman globes dated 1779 contained
corrections and additions which brought them to date,
a fact which is noted in the following legend: &#8220;Globus terraqueus
cura Societatis cosmographicae Upsalensis, editus
ab Andr. Akerman Nunc emendatus.... opera Frederici
Akrel 1779.&#8221; &#8220;Terrestrial globe issued under the auspices
of the Cosmographical Society of Upsala, edited by Andrea
Akerman, now corrected.... the work of Frederick Akrel
1779.&#8221;

The Biblioteca Universitario of Bologna possesses a very
interesting manuscript terrestrial globe (Fig. 128), the work
of P. D. Pietro Rosini, an Olivetan monk. Word from the
181librarian with photograph kindly sent170 gives us the information
that this splendid globe was constructed in the year
1762, that it is a fine example of the period and is in an
excellent state of preservation. It has a diameter of about
150 cm., being one of the largest constructed in Italy. The
sphere is constructed of wooden plates securely braced. It has
a meridian circle of heavy brass, a horizon circle of wood,
having on its upper surface the usual representations referring
to the constellations of the zodiac, the names of the
months, and the principal directions. The circle on its inner
edge is fashioned to receive the sphere, but it has an outer
edge which is octagonal. Over the surface of the ball irregular
pieces of paper were pasted and on this the geographical
map was drawn by hand. Practically all geographical names
are in the Italian language, as are the few geographical
legends. The author and date legend in Latin reads, &#8220;D.
Petrus Rosini de Lendinara Monus Olivus fecit ann: 1762.&#8221;
&#8220;D. Petrus Rosini of Lendinara, an Olivetan monk made
this in the year 1762.&#8221; Fiorini cites a reference to a letter
written by Rosini wherein he is referred to as a professor,
noting that other information concerning him seems to be
unobtainable. From the fact of his having constructed a
terrestrial globe and of his reference in his letter to an
eruption of Mount Vesuvius, one would obtain the impression
that he was a lover of scientific studies, and especially
of geography.

Rigobert Bonne (1727-1794), a distinguished French
hydrographer and engineer, achieved likewise a very considerable
reputation as a geographer and cartographer; indeed,
the great majority of his scientific publications were
within the field of geography.171 With Joseph J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Le
Fran&ccedil;ais de Lalande (1732-1807), one of the most famous
of French astronomers,172 he undertook the construction of a
terrestrial and a celestial globe on which it was proposed to
record in particular all of the most recent discoveries in
both the field of geography and that of astronomy. To these182
globes they gave a diameter of about 31 cm., following, in
constructing the gore maps with which each sphere was
covered, the method of Bion, giving very careful consideration
to the fact that the paper on which the maps were
printed would expand somewhat unevenly when moistened
with the paste used in the mounting. It seems probable that
Bonne completed the terrestrial globe about the year 1771,
and Lalande the celestial about the year 1775, and that the
engraving of the maps was entrusted to Lattr&eacute;, who had
at this time a place of marked distinction in the profession
he represented. Lalande says of the first issue of their work:
&#8220;M. Lattr&eacute;, Graveur ordinaire de Mgr. le Dauphin et de
M. le Duc d&#8217;Orleans, publiera vers la fin de cette ann&eacute;e
1771, deux globes d&#8217;un pied de diam&egrave;tre, faites avec le plus
grand soin, et sur les observations les plus r&eacute;centes dessines
avec une nouvelle exactitude; M. Bonne s&#8217;est charg&eacute; du
globe terrestre, et je suis occup&eacute; actuellement du globe
c&eacute;leste. Ces globes seront en m&ecirc;me temps r&eacute;duits &agrave; 8 pouces
et &agrave; six; chaque assortissement aura des sph&egrave;res du m&ecirc;me
diam&egrave;tre. Les prix seront annonc&eacute;s dans les journaux.&#8221; A
short time later these globe makers issued a publication in
which they especially described their work, and Lalande
noted in his &#8216;Bibliographie astronomique&#8217; under the year
1775: &#8220;On trouve dans le Globe c&eacute;leste toutes les &eacute;toiles
alors connues, toutes les constellations nouvelles de la
Caille, celle que j&#8217;avais introduite sous le nom de Messier, et
toutes les d&eacute;couvertes g&eacute;ographiques obtenues depuis quelques
ann&eacute;es par plusieurs voyages autour du monde. On
trouve ces globes chez Lamarche, rue du Foin.&#8221; While it
has not been possible to locate a pair of the first edition of
these globes, there may be found in the Osservatorio Astronomico
of Palermo an undated terrestrial globe by Bonne
and a celestial, clearly intended as a companion piece, dated
1779. In all probability they are but reprints of the first
edition, having the same diameters, that is, about 31 cm.
Each is furnished with a graduated horizon circle of wood,183
a graduated horizon circle of brass, and a small brass hour
circle marked from I to XII, the whole being supported by
three turned columns. They are reported as being well preserved.
A pair has likewise been located in the Geographisches
Institut of G&ouml;ttingen.

The British Museum possesses a small terrestrial globe
7 cm. in diameter, signed N. Lane and dated 1776. Over
a sphere of wood has been pasted the engraved gore map,
which gives but little geographical information. It has not
been possible to obtain a biographical reference to this globe
maker, who probably was an unimportant printer of maps in
London at this time.

Charles Messier (1730-1817), a French astronomer, map,
and globe maker, was a native of Lorraine.173 In the year
1751 he went to Paris, where he soon became associated with
Delisle, first as his secretary, during which period he gave
striking proof of his abilities, and later as his trusted assistant.
His fame quickly extended to other lands, and he became
a member of the Academy of Sciences of Berlin, also
of the Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg, each of
which organizations published a considerable number of his
scientific papers. It appears that his fame as an astronomer
rested chiefly on his investigations of the nature and the
movements of comets, becoming known as &#8220;le furet des
com&egrave;tes.&#8221; Messier&#8217;s contemporary and intimate associate was
Jean Fortin (1750-1831), whose fame as a scientist rests
primarily upon his work as a maker of mathematical instruments.
Like Bonne and Lalande, who labored jointly in the
construction of terrestrial and celestial globes, Messier and
Fortin were active in the same field. In the year 1780 they
placed on sale at the shop of Fortin in Rue de la Harpe
pairs of their globes, each having a diameter of about 31
cm. Lalande refers to them as &#8220;Globes d&#8217;un pied de diam&egrave;tre.
Chez Fortin. Paris 1780. Le Globe c&eacute;leste par Messier:
Les &eacute;toiles r&eacute;duites &agrave; 1800, d&#8217;apr&egrave;s les tables que j&#8217;avais
faites pour mon Globe. Le Globe terrestre par Fortin d&#8217;apr&egrave;s184
les nouvelles d&eacute;couvertes g&eacute;ographiques.&#8221; It has not been
possible to locate a copy of Fortin&#8217;s terrestrial globe, but an
example of Messier&#8217;s celestial may be found in the Osservatorio
Meteorico of the University of Parma, in the Istituto di
Fisica of the University of Siena, in the Biblioteca S. Scolastica
e S. Benedetto in Subiaco, and in the Liceo Machiavelli
of Lucca. Copies of a celestial globe by Fortin, each
about 22 cm. in diameter, may be found in the Convento dei
Frati della Missione of Chieri, in the Biblioteca Comunale
of Correggio, and in the Liceo Andrea Doria of Novi.

The Hispanic Society of America possesses a good example
of Fortin&#8217;s work (Fig. 129), this being an armillary
sphere, having at the common center of its system of circles
a terrestrial globe about 5 cm. in diameter. It is without
date, but probably was constructed about the year 1780.
In the South Pacific within a cartouch is the inscription &#8220;A
Paris chez le Sr. Fortin. Rue de la Harpe.&#8221; This example
is 41 cm. in height, having a graduated horizon circle 31
cm. in diameter, supported on a turned wooden base by four
arms or quadrants. The terrestrial globe map of twelve gores
is much darkened with age but gives in good outline the
several continents with a few geographical names. Its armillae
are of pasteboard, consisting of a supporting meridian
circle within which the several celestial circles can be revolved
on the extended polar axis of the terrestrial globe.
These celestial circles represent the zodiac, on the surface of
which are given the names of the several zodiacal constellations
and the names of the months, the meridian circles, the
tropics, the equator, the two polar circles with an hour circle
at the north pole, all of these being so attached as not to
permit of independent motion. Attached to one of the meridian
circles is a device for representing eclipses, the one of
the sun and the other of the moon.

George Adams, the elder (fl. 1760), maker of mathematical
instruments and optician to His Majesty George III of
England, won great distinction for himself as a maker of
185terrestrial and celestial globes, and as a writer on geographical
and astronomical subjects. With him in his work were
associated his sons George (1750-1795) and Dudley, to
whom, after the death of the brother, fell the management
of the business. We know of Dudley&#8217;s success in his work,
which he must have carried on well into the first quarter of
the nineteenth century, though we know neither the date
of his birth nor of his death. In the year 1766 the elder
Adams issued the first edition of a very useful work on
globes, including a consideration of their construction and
their uses.174 In the year 1810 appeared the thirtieth edition
of this work, with a preface and additions by the son, Dudley.
The title of the work suggests that the first issue was
prepared as a description of globes which the author had
just put upon the market, but globes of his bearing a date
so early seem to be unknown. None have been located
which appear to have been issued earlier than the year 1772,
after which time we know there were repeated issues signed
either &#8220;G. Adams&#8221; or &#8220;D. Adams.&#8221; A pair of the date 1782
may be found in the Museo Astronomico of Rome. These
appear to be in a fair state of preservation (Fig. 130). Each
has a diameter of about 46 cm., being furnished with a
graduated brass meridian circle within which the sphere revolves,
a graduated horizon circle of wood, having pasted
thereon the usual records referring to the zodiacal constellations
and to the time reckoning. This horizon circle rests
upon four supporting arms or quadrants, which in turn are
carried by a tripod base of wood. The spheres are of pasteboard
with plaster of Paris covering, on which the respective
maps have been pasted, each map being composed of twenty-four
gores or biangles, or of twice twenty-four, since each is
cut on the line of the equator to facilitate mounting. The
geographical records given on the terrestrial globe map are
practically such as one could find on the best plane maps of
the period, always, however, in this connection remembering
that those regions which had not been visited or carefully186
charted by explorers gave to the map maker considerable
latitude for a play of his imagination. It is interesting, for
example, here to note that Adams appears to have been very
uncertain about his information relative to the western and
southwestern part of the present United States. He seems to
have caught from some explorer&#8217;s account that the Colorado
River flows westward, emptying directly into the Pacific,
and he so marks it, giving, however, to the river the name St.
Bartholomew. The celestial globe revolves on the axis of
the equator, the gores being made to terminate at the poles
of the ecliptic. Constellations are represented so far as they
have been named by astronomers to date, the several figures
being artistically drawn, on which color has been somewhat
sparingly employed. Each constellation is given its old
name with an English translation; star names, when given,
are frequently in Arabic, Latin or Chinese, and are distinguished
by Greek letters. Recently discovered stars are
so marked as to be easily distinguished.

Fig. 130. Terrestrial Globe of George Adams, 1782.

In addition to the above, a pair of Adams globes may be
found in the Osservatorio Astronomico of Naples and a pair
in the Biblioteca Classense of Ravenna. A copy of the terrestrial
may be found in the Seminario Vescovile of Padua. A
copy of the terrestrial dated 1785 may be found in the
Biblioteca Real of Madrid, agreeing in general with the
preceding except in the mounting. The author and date
legend appears in a neat cartouch in the North Pacific, reading:
&#8220;Britanniarum Rigi Augustissimo Georgio Tertio
Scientiarum Cultori pariter et praefidio Globum hunc Terrestrem.
Omnes hactenus exploratios terrarum tractus. Ad

et pietatis monumentum D. D. Q. Omni cultu et officio

regium in vico (?) Fleet Street, 1785.&#8221;

The American Geographical Society possesses a pair of
the Adams globes, the gift of Mrs. Thomas F. Byrnes, dated
1871797, and made by &#8220;Dudley Adams Globe Maker to the
King, Inst. Maker to his Majesty &amp; Optician to H. R. H.
the Prince of Wales. No. 60 Fleet Street, London.&#8221; They
are in a fair state of preservation, the celestial, however,
being somewhat damaged through attempts to turn the
sphere, which does not move freely on its axis within the
meridian and the horizon circle. These are mounted on a
high tripod base and are movable right or left, just as they
are movable for elevation or depression of the pole in the
usual manner. It does not appear that additions or corrections
were made for this issue.

Nathaniel Hill of London, active as a map engraver
about the middle of the eighteenth century, likewise turned
his attention to the construction of globes.175 Those of his
make now known, however, are very small, consequently
they present but meager geographical details. Like certain
productions of James Ferguson, the Hill globes might be
referred to as pocket globes.

The New York Public Library possesses a fine example
of his work (Fig. 130a), bearing the title and author legend
placed in the North Pacific, &#8220;A New Terrestrial Globe by
Nath. Hill 1754.&#8221; This globe has a diameter of 7 cm. It is
furnished with a graduated meridian circle, surmounted at
the north pole with an hour circle and pointer. The graduation
is somewhat unusual, beginning as it does with 0 degrees
at either pole and marked by tens on the right half of
the circle through 90 degrees or to the equator, and with 90
degrees at either pole and marked by tens on the left to 0 degrees
at the equator. The horizon circle of wood has represented
on its surface the names of the zodiacal constellations,
the names of the months, and the thirty-two compass directions,
and rests upon a base of four branching arms or quadrants,
which in turn are supported by three widely spreading
feet, this base being fashioned and carved in the Chippendale
style. The sphere is covered with the usual twelve gores
truncated in latitude both north and south at about 68188
degrees and has the polar spaces covered by circular discs.
The entire piece, including the map, is remarkably well preserved.
The Pacific is called &#8220;The Great South Sea,&#8221; while
just off the coast of &#8220;S. America&#8221; we read &#8220;Pacific Sea.&#8221;
Between &#8220;N. America&#8221; and &#8220;Asia&#8221; is a great open sea,
Alaska being omitted. We find such names given as &#8220;Florida,&#8221;
&#8220;Virginia,&#8221; &#8220;Carolina,&#8221; &#8220;Maryla&#8221;: the Missouri River
is called the &#8220;Long R.&#8221; The meridian on which the graduation
in latitude is represented is 150 degrees west, passing
through the Pacific slightly to the west of California. In
&#8220;S. America&#8221; there are numerous regional names given,
including &#8220;Brazil,&#8221; &#8220;Peru,&#8221; &#8220;Terra firma,&#8221; &#8220;Chili.&#8221; In the
East Indies we find &#8220;New Holland,&#8221; &#8220;New Zeeland,&#8221;
neither with completed coast line. An attached card tells us
that this globe was &#8220;Presented to the New York Public
Library by Mrs. Henry Draper, Oct. 9, 1908.&#8221;

There likewise may be found in the British Museum a
copy, presumably of this same globe, dated 1754, and a
copy in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale of Paris, signed and
dated. This Paris copy is furnished with a cover opening
along the line of the equator and having on its inner surface
a representation of the celestial sphere which is neither
signed nor dated, but which is in a good state of preservation.

Fiorini refers to certain pairs of globes being apparently
copies of the work of Gian Francesco Costa without credit
being noted. These globes, inferior in the matter of engraving
to the work of Costa, were issued as the work of Innocente
Alessandri and Pietro Scaltaglia.176 The terrestrial
globe bears the inscription, &#8220;Nova et accurata descrizione
del Globo Terracqueo dirizzato sopra le pi&ugrave; recenti Osservazioni
del Sigr Delisle e degli ultimi viaggiatori. Per uso dell&#8217;

globe appears on the celestial, reading, &#8220;Globo celeste nel

Biblioteca Comunale of Cagli, likewise one may be found
in the office of the Eredit&agrave; Bottrigari of Bologna. Copies of
the celestial may be found in the Museo Astronomico of
Rome, in the Seminario Vescovile of Brescia, in the Tipolitografia
Roberto of Bassano. Somewhat later it appears
that the bookdealer Viani reissued the terrestrial globe, undated,
perhaps with the thought of bringing them to date,
that they might not be crowded out of the market by the
recently constructed globes by Giovanni Maria Cassini. The
inscription on this globe reads, &#8220;Nova et accurata descrizione
del Globo Terracqueo dirizzato sopra le pi&ugrave; recenti
Osservazioni del Sigr dell&#8217; Isle e degli ultimi viaggiatori e del
Cap. Cook negli ultimi suoi viaggi. In Vena appo Mattio
Viani in Campo S. Bartolomeo.&#8221; &#8220;New and accurate description
of the Terrestrial globe based on the most recent observations
of Sr. Delisle and on the records of the most recent
navigators and of Captain Cook in his last voyages. In
Venice by Mattio Viani in Campo S. Bartolomeo.&#8221; Copies190
of this issue may be found in the Museo Astronomico of
Rome, in the library of the artist Giuseppe Bortognoni of
Bologna, in the library of Sr. Fenaroli of Brescia, in the
Biblioteca Vescovile of Rimini, and in the Tipolitografia
Roberto of Bassano.

Among the geographers of this period who were contributing
to French leadership may be named Charles Francis
Delamarche (1740-1817). He was a native of Paris, in
which city, under the patronage of King Louis XV, he
carried on his activities as map and globe maker, conducting
at the same time a shop for their distribution. He seems to
have patterned his globe work largely after that of Gilles
and Didier Robert de Vaugondy, giving to his completed
products practically the same dimensions and mounting.
His earliest examples bear the date 1785, of which only one
copy, a celestial globe, has been located, this now belonging
to the Osservatorio Meteorico of Venice. In the year 1791,
he constructed a pair of globes each having a diameter of
about 18 cm., only the terrestrial being dated, and in the
same year he issued his treatise which doubtless was intended
to serve as an explanatory text for these globes, at the same
time advertising and popularizing his productions.177 Examples
of this issue may be found in the Biblioteca di Brera of
Milan, and in the Liceo Carlo Alberto of Novara. A copy
of the terrestrial may be found in the Istituto Nautico of
Palermo, and a copy of the celestial in the Convento dei
Frati della Missione of Chieri. It could not have been long
after this issue of 1791 that he undertook the construction
of a terrestrial globe about 31 cm. in diameter, a copy of
which may be found in the Istituto di Fisico of the University
of Siena.

We know that like his contemporary, Fortin, he also constructed
armillary spheres, one example of which it has been
possible to locate. Fiorini thus refers to it, his citation being
given in free translation.178 It is a Copernican sphere, that is,
having a representation of the sun placed at the common191
center of the armillae instead of a representation of the earth
as in the Ptolemaic sphere. It may be found in the palace of
Sr. Scaramucci in S. Maria a Monte in the province of
Florence. Attached to a base of wood about 20 cm. in height
is an iron rod 35 cm. long. This rod passes through the
several rings, about which they can be revolved, each being
in its movement independent of the others. The first circle
about the central sun represents the orbit of Mercury, and
has written upon it &#8220;&Eacute;loign&eacute; du Soleil 8537, inclin&eacute; 7 degr.,
fait sa r&eacute;volution en 87 jours, 23 heures, 50 m.&#8221; The second
represents the orbit of Venus, having written upon it the
distance 15928&frac12; diameters of the earth, inclination 3 degrees
and 22 minutes; it completes its revolution in 2224
days 16 hours and 41 minutes. In a space much larger than
that which separates the other circles, there is the orbit of the
earth, upon which is written that this planet passes over
the ecliptic in 365 days 5 hours and 49 minutes, and that
it is 22000 diameters distant from the sun. This ring representing
the orbit of the earth is opened for the insertion of
a representation of the moon, adjusted to revolve on an
adjusted pivot. Armillae have been provided representing
the orbits of Mars, of Jupiter, and of Saturn with statements
concerning their respective distances from the sun and their
respective periods of revolution. The outer and larger armillae
represent the colures, the ecliptic, and the horizon, and
on the last the inscription, &#8220;&Agrave; Paris chez Delamarche G&eacute;og.
Rue du Foin Saint Jacques au Coll&egrave;ge de Mre Gervais.&#8221;

In the year 1793 Vincenzo Rosa, a little-known Italian
cosmographer, constructed two terrestrial globes, the maps
of which being in manuscript. The spheres are of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;
covered with a light coating of plaster. Each of these
globes has a diameter of about 100 cm. An inscription in
Italian reads, &#8220;Vincenzo Rosa fece nel 1793 n. 24. La geografia
&egrave; quasi tutta delle carte di Robert del Vaugondy e di
De-la-Marche.&#8221; &#8220;Made by Vincent Rosa in the year 1793
n. 24. The geographical information is almost entirely from192
the maps of Robert de Vaugondy and of Delamarche.&#8221; One
copy may be found in the Biblioteca Universitario of Pavia,
and the other in the Liceo Foscolo of the same city. Fiorini
notes that the &#8220;n. 24.&#8221; of the first is given as &#8220;n. 21.&#8221; in the
second.179

The last important globe maker of the eighteenth century
in Italy was Giovanni Maria Cassini (fl. 1790), an
engraver, and a geographer of distinction, to the truth of
which statement his excellent work gives testimony. As evidence
of his interest in the matter of globe construction we
have the introduction to his &#8216;Nuovo atlante geografico universale
...,&#8217; wherein he gives carefully devised rules
for the construction of globe gores, and in addition we still
find a number of his completed globes, particularly in Italian
museums and libraries. These globes (Fig. 131), dated, the
terrestrial 1790, and the celestial 1792, have each a diameter
of about 35 cm., each covering map being composed of
twelve gores cut at latitude 80 degrees both north and south,
the polar space having the usual circular disc covering. Each
is furnished with a brass meridian circle within which the
sphere may be revolved, an hour circle, a horizon circle, on
the surface of which are the usual concentric circles with
the names of the several zodiacal constellations, the names
of the months, and the principal directions. The terrestrial
globe has an author and date legend reading, &#8220;Globo terrestre
delineato sulle ultime osservazioni con i viaggi e nuove
scoperte del Cap. Cook inglese. In Rome.&#8221;

Fig. 131. Terrestrial Globe of Giovanni Maria Cassini, 1790.

In The Hispanic Society&#8217;s collection is a terrestrial globe
(Fig. 132), being a solid wooden ball 21 cm. in diameter,
over which has been pasted the gore map composed of twelve
sections, each cut at the parallel of 70 degrees both north
and south, the polar space being covered with circular discs
each forty degrees in diameter. It is neither signed nor dated
but is clearly of German origin, since practically all geographical
names and legends are in the German language.
The title, placed within a circle to the west of Australia,
193&#8220;Neu Holland,&#8221; reads &#8220;Die Erde nach den neusten Entdeckungen
und besten Charten entworfen.&#8221; Its date cannot
be far from 1800, perhaps a little later, seeing that it
assigns the name &#8220;Nord Amerikanischer Staat&#8221; to the region
east of the Mississippi River, except to &#8220;Florida&#8221; which
extends westward to this river. We find but one actual date
given, this referring to the discovery of a small group of the
&#8220;Gesellschafts Inseln,&#8221; reading &#8220;Inseln welche die Spanier
entdekt haben sollen 1773.&#8221; It is constructed to revolve
within a graduated meridian circle of brass and an octagonal
horizon of wood, on which are indicated in picture the
twelve signs of the zodiac, the calendar, and the thirty-two
winds or directions, the whole resting on four plain supports
of wood strengthened below by light crossbars.

The map is one well drawn for the period, and the engraving
of the several names and legends has been most
skilfully done. Regional names are numerous, but there has
not been an overcrowding of the map with minute details.
On the west coast of North America, for example, we find
such names as &#8220;Norfolk,&#8221; &#8220;Neu Cornwallis,&#8221; &#8220;Neu Hanover,&#8221;
&#8220;Neu Georgia,&#8221; &#8220;Neu Albion,&#8221; &#8220;Neu Navarre,&#8221;
&#8220;Mexico oder Neu Spanien.&#8221; Central America with the West
Indies is called &#8220;Mittel America oder West Indien.&#8221; In
South America we find &#8220;Neu Granada,&#8221; &#8220;Peru,&#8221; &#8220;Chili,&#8221;
&#8220;Brasilien,&#8221; but &#8220;Prasilisches Meer.&#8221; Certain localities are
especially distinguished by the addition of color, as the
coast of Australia except the southern coast, which is marked
with a dotted line. Many of the East Indian islands and
the islands of the Indian Ocean are outlined in color, as also
the coast of &#8220;Vorder Indien,&#8221; and &#8220;Hinter Indien,&#8221; the
coast of &#8220;Arabien,&#8221; and certain other sections. The geography
of the interior of Africa is not as well represented as
on many an earlier map, a fact particularly noticeable with
reference to the Nile River. The prime meridian is made
to pass through Cape Verde, to the west of which, stretching194
practically along its entire length, we read &#8220;Der Amerikanische
Ocean.&#8221;

Among the globe makers of the eighteenth century whose
work carries us over into the nineteenth may be named
William Cary (1759-1825).180 At first associated with Ramsden,
a renowned mechanic, he established himself in an
independent business in London in the year 1790. He is
reputed to have constructed the first transit circle made in
England, which circle had a diameter of two feet and was
provided with a reading microscope. One of his circles of the
above date, 41 cm. in diameter, is reported as belonging to
the Observatory of Z&uuml;rich. In addition to the altitude,
azimuth, sextant, reflecting and refracting telescopic, and
microscopic instruments made by him, he interested himself
in the construction of terrestrial and celestial globes. Those
examples of his to which reference may here be made do not
appear to be of the highest order, perhaps due to the fact
that he was primarily an instrument maker and not a geographer
or an astronomer. Further, the majority of his globes
which have been located bear dates subsequent to the year
1800, and therefore do not properly call for reference here.

In the private library of Sr. Vittorio Bianchini of Macerata
four of the Cary globes may be found, three celestial
and one terrestrial dated 1799. A celestial globe of the
same date may be found in the Osservatorio Astronomico of
Rome, but its companion, a terrestrial globe, bears the date
1815. Extant Cary globes of the early nineteenth century
may be considered numerous.

and Methods

making.&mdash;Materials employed.&mdash;Experiments in map projection.&mdash;The

IN this concluding chapter it is not proposed to consider
in detail the technical features of globe construction,
as these features have presented themselves in the long
period which has been under review; the rather to give,
somewhat in the nature of a summary, a general word as
to the development of the simple armilla of the ancients,
&#8220;in continued succession, receiving ripeness and perfection&#8221;
in such celestial spheres as were those of Mohammed ben
Helal, of Tycho, of Hondius, or of Blaeu; into the terrestrial
spheres of Sch&ouml;ner, of Mercator, of Greuter, or of
Coronelli.

We have seen that during these years there were problems
mechanical, mathematical, and artistic continually arising,
in the solution of which talent of a high order was often
exhibited; problems having to do with the kind of material
to be employed, with the shaping and the graduation of the197
rings or circles, with the construction of the supporting bases
which entered into the completed product, with the engraving
of the map on the surface of the metal sphere, or with
the designing and the engraving of the plates for the printing
of the map to be used in covering the prepared ball, and
the fitting of the same to its curved surface.

The principal astronomical instrument employed by such
ancient astronomers as Eudoxus, Timocharis, and Hipparchus
appears to have been at first but a single metal ring,
perhaps of brass. At any rate their instruments must have
been exceedingly simple, perhaps the simplest form of the
astrolabe (Fig. 133), yet they sufficed as aids in the solution
of such astronomical problems as suggested themselves
in that early day. The addition of a second ring to the198
simple instrument gave further aid to the observer in his
efforts to determine the declination and the right ascension
of any of the heavenly bodies. These rings came to be considered,
the first as a celestial meridian circle, the second
as a celestial horizon circle, and in the passing years others
were added to represent the ecliptic, the colures, the tropics,
the polar circles, and the orbits of the several planets, until
we have the fully developed armillary sphere of a Vopel
or a Santucci.181

Relative to globes proper in antiquity, it will have been
noted that in general there is an element of uncertainty as
to their exact character, which speaks out in the numerous
allusions to them. None has survived to our day save the
Atlante Farnese. This globe of marble is not so mounted
as to permit its revolution, resting as it does upon the
shoulders of the mythical Atlas, yet in its representation
of the figures of the several constellations, then recognized
by astronomers, it differs practically but little from the
celestial globes, that is, solid spheres, constructed a millennium
and a half later.182 We cannot, however, draw the conclusion
from this one example that such globes were generally
looked upon as practical instruments for use in
astronomical studies, yet there clearly were those who did
so regard them.

Doubtless the globe or globes to which Ptolemy alludes
were intended to be of practical value. He tells us they
should be constructed of brass, and as before noted, he
describes the use and the construction of such instruments.
Like the maps he probably made, though none survives, it is
not difficult, from his description, to reconstruct them.
Such celestial globes as Ptolemy may have prepared were
doubtless adjustable, but were not made to revolve by
mechanical device such as we frequently meet with in globes
of the seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries, nor were
they like the mechanical contrivance of Archimedes, clearly
intended to represent the movements of the celestial bodies,199
and perhaps their movements relative to the earth. No
description of Archimedes&#8217; mechanism survives by means
of which it could now be reproduced with anything like a
satisfactory degree of certainty.

The allusions of Leontius Mechanicus, referred to in
Chapter III, read like a globe maker&#8217;s instructions of the
eighteenth century. He knew his Ptolemy whom he followed
in the main, but he wrote as one who clearly did not sense
the approaching decline of interest in the physical sciences.

And what can be said of the methods and the materials
for globe making during the period of the so-called middle
ages? The survivals, and these are only of the later years
of the period, are of Arabic origin, which, without exception,
appear to have been intended primarily for use in
astronomical studies. They are either armillary spheres, or
metal balls, on the surface of which are the engraved representations
of the starry heavens, with the figures of the
several constellations. Without a known exception these
are of small size, and if furnished at all with mounting,
only that of a simple character. There is reason for thinking
that such astronomical instruments were made in great
numbers, and that they were to be found in practically all
Arabic observatories.183

The interesting allusions in King Alfonso&#8217;s &#8216;Libros del
Saber de Astronomia,&#8217; from which citations may be found
in our Chapter IV, give us information concerning both
methods and materials which might be employed in globe
construction in his day. It is not there stated that the author
had information concerning the actual use of the more than
twenty named materials which might be chosen for their
manufacture. He does, however, lead us to infer that there
may have been experiments by his contemporaries in which
trial was made of the fitness of the several materials named,
his conclusion being that wood or brass was the most
suitable.

It has previously been noted that globes appear to have200
been made now and then for use in the monastic schools,
but we find no detailed description of their special character.
Here and there, it is true, may be found reference
to the adjustability of their parts, and to their rings which
made them serviceable for furthering astronomical studies.
The inference is fair that the globes of these Christian
schools were armillary spheres, and were not solid or hollow
balls on the surface of which the starry firmament or the
earth had been depicted.

Behaim&#8217;s globe of the year 1492 seems to represent a
radical departure in globe construction. His idea appears to
have been novel. He employed a mould in the making of his
globe ball, and over the surface of this completed ball
pasted irregular strips of parchment which furnished a
suitable ground for the draughting of the map with its geographical
outlines and its artistic adornments in color.
Behaim&#8217;s globe mounting was of the simplest character,
consisting of a metal meridian circle within which the sphere
could be revolved, a horizon circle of like material, the
whole resting upon a tripod base. Although effort was made
to establish in N&uuml;rnberg an institute wherein globe making
might be taught especially, the plan seems not to have
carried, and such as were later produced in this city were
merely the output of the mathematical instrument maker&#8217;s
shop or of the geographical establishments.

Throughout all the early years of the modern period,
metal globes continued to find favor, to the making of
which skilled workmen in the thriving industrial centers
of Southern Germany, Southeastern France, Northern
Switzerland, and Northern Italy set themselves. Brass,
copper, silver, and gold were employed very frequently in
their construction, the last-named metals being used in the
making of globes primarily for ornamental purposes.184
Globes with manuscript maps, as before noted, seemed to
find especial favor in Italy, in the making of which much
artistic skill was displayed. The spheres for such globes201
were usually of wood either solid or hollow, of well-fashioned
strips of wood, canvas covered, the whole carefully
glued and braced that the spherical shape might not be
affected with time. In the preparation of the sphere to receive
the manuscript map, workmen proceeded much as did
Behaim, pasting over its surface irregular strips of parchment
or paper, adding occasionally a groundwork of paint
suitable for taking the sketch of the draughtsman. As the
years passed, and the engraved map found increasing favor,
practically all globe balls, with exceptions as noted above,
were made either of plaster shot through and through with
a binding material, usually of fiber, and fashioned over a
mould, or of a preparation of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;.

The increasing interest in globes and globe making manifesting
itself in the early years of the sixteenth century led
to the devising of methods for their more rapid construction.
If the opening years of the sixteenth century witnessed a
rapid expansion of geographical knowledge, none the less
did they witness an improvement in the making of maps
wherein this expanding knowledge could fittingly be recorded.
It is interesting to note how rapidly change was
made from one method of map draughting to another in the
search for a projection which might prove itself to be altogether
suitable. As a result of this striving we have for
example the projection of Donnus Nicolas Germanus employed
in his maps of the geographer Ptolemy, and often
referred to as the Donis projection.185 Then we find the
stereographic meridional186 and the stereographic polar,187 the
cordiform single and double188 which seem to have been a
development from the orthographic projection well represented
in the map of Johannes Stabius (Fig. 45) who appears
to have been the first to give the method prominence.
In addition to the projections mentioned there were many
modifications, to suit the notions of the draughtsmen, which
were employed in the early sixteenth century.189 With the
fuller realization of the fact that the earth is a sphere, the202
desire accurately to represent in the maps its spherical surface
continued to seek for expression, an expression that
would do least violence to the fact that the degrees of latitude
and longitude vary in length, particularly those of
longitude as one passes from the equator toward the poles
or from the poles toward the equator. If the earth is a
sphere then why could a map so draughted as truly to represent
the surface of a sphere not be counted the most acceptable?
This must have been the argument of those who
especially applied themselves to the designing of maps suitable
for a spherical surface, that is, for application to a
globe ball.

Who first conceived the idea of fashioning globe gore
maps we do not know. Fiorini cites evidence190 that Francesco
Rosselli (1445-1510), a printer of large and small
maps in Florence, included in his productions gore maps to
be used in globe construction, and this probably before the
year 1507, but none of his work of this character has come
down to us. The so-called Waldseem&uuml;ller gores are the oldest
known, of which but one copy is extant.191 By some they
are thought to have been constructed for his globe to which
he refers in his &#8216;Cosmographiae Introductio,&#8217; but they are
unsigned and undated. They are somewhat crude and much
manipulation would be required to fit them to the surface
of a sphere. Before the first quarter of the sixteenth century
had passed other globe gore maps made their appearance,
such as those undoubtedly the work of Sch&ouml;ner or
of the Sch&ouml;nerian school, or such as the gores of Boulengier192
exquisitely engraved and printed, though so far as we know
never used in covering the surface of a sphere.

The artist Albrect D&uuml;rer (1471-1528), as we are informed,
was one of the earliest to set himself to the solution
of the problem having to do with the development of
a spherical surface into a flat surface, yet he never seems
to have thought an exact mathematical solution possible.
It was a problem, he realized, in which there could be but203
an approximate solution. In trying to illustrate what he
thought to be the nearest approach to the same he found
himself led to the idea of the globe gore.193 Of his illustration,
he said, &#8220;Die sphera oder ein Kugel wenn man sie
durch jr mittag linien zerschneydet, und in Planum legt, so
gewinnt sie ein Gestalt eines Kam, wie ich das hie hat
auffgerissen.&#8221; &#8220;Should one divide the sphere or ball on the204
line of the equator and lay this out as a plane, one has
the figure of a comb, as is here shown.&#8221; D&uuml;rer worked out
a simple rule for the construction of the globe biangles,194
which rule served measurably well for the purpose intended.
While it would not be inappropriate to give here a r&eacute;sum&eacute;
of his formula, as well as the formulae of others who set
themselves to a like task, we should in so doing be carried
into a field rather more technical than seems fitting for our
purpose.195

Two years after D&uuml;rer had published his observations on
this subject Henricus Loriti Glareanus (1488-1551) issued
a small treatise on geography,196 devoting his Chapter XIX
bearing title &#8216;De inducendo papyro in globo&#8217; to globe-gore
construction. He proposed the employment of twelve gores
or biangles (Fig. 134) so arranged for printing that the
shorter diameter of each should represent 30 degrees of
longitude, the sum therefore representing 360 degrees or
the equatorial circumference of the globe they were intended
to cover; the longer diameter of each gore representing the
semicircumference of the globe and extending from pole to
pole, that is, a meridian. We do not know that his formula
for gore construction was closely followed by any globe
maker of the period, nor does Glareanus himself appear to
have attempted a practical application of his method, at
least we have no evidence that he ever actually attempted
to construct a globe. He, however, had made an important
contribution toward the solution of the problem of how
best to multiply these instruments which were increasingly
recognized as of great value in geographical and astronomical
studies. The general method of gore map making rapidly
found favor despite such practical difficulties, for example,
as arose from the peculiarity inseparable from the quality
inherent in any and all paper, that is, its irregular expansion
when moistened. This difficulty the globe makers, of course,
were continually seeking to overcome or reduce to a minimum,
as the years passed, through a careful selection of205
paper to be used, through a more skilful manipulation of
the paper made moist by the application of the paste or
glue employed in attaching the map to the surface of the
sphere,197 and through a more careful working out of the
mathematical problem having to do with the proper proportions
of each of the gores.

D&uuml;rer had proposed the employment of sixteen segments,
Waldseem&uuml;ller, Sch&ouml;ner, Boulengier, and Glareanus had
thought twelve a more suitable number. As the years passed
we find a preference manifesting itself now for twelve,
now for sixteen, now for eighteen, twenty-four, or thirty-six
with a more common preference for the smaller number.
The several biangles for the maps alluded to above were
fashioned to extend from pole to pole in what we may call
the equatorial system; Mercator, as has been noted, introduced
the novel idea of truncating his gores twenty degrees
from each pole, preparing as a covering for the remaining
polar space a circular disc, having the required diameter of
forty degrees.198 This plan he proposed for the practical
reason that a paper covering for a sphere so constructed
could be applied with greater ease and with greater accuracy
than one consisting of complete biangular figures, remembering
the tendency of the paper to expand and the
difficulty in avoiding folds.

As there was much inclination among map makers to
experiment in the matter of map projection so there was an
inclination to experiment, as the years passed, in the matter
of design for the globe gores. In the so-called Da Vinci
gores we find them drawn in two groups of four each (Fig.
135), and instead of the globe biangle we have the globe
equilateral triangle. Their application to a spherical surface
could only have been made with difficulty, if at all; indeed
we cannot be certain that in so outlining a map of the world
the draughtsman&#8217;s intention was to use it in globe construction.
The plan seems never to have been followed by any
of the other map makers, or by any globe maker. We find an206
207interesting early instance in which the gore map construction
was clearly employed merely as a method for plane map
making, a method having certain very commendable features
(Fig. 136). The author of this map is unknown.

Map Construction, ca. 1550.

In referring to unusual forms in gore construction attention
may again be called to the map of Alonso de Santa
Cruz and to that of Antonius Florianus, in which maps the
plan was hemispherical,199 the central point in the construction
of each hemisphere, a northern and a southern, being
the pole, the circumference of the circle in which the thirty-six
gores were drawn, representing the equator. But again
we do not know that such a gore map was ever employed in
globe construction though the method, it seems, would lend
itself to that end.

It can be readily understood that numerous modifications
in the matter of globe-gore construction and their application
to the surface of the sphere, more or less detailed in
character, were introduced as the years passed, but the modifications
were by no means at all times in the line of improvement.200
The technical skill of the present day does not
surpass that which one occasionally finds exhibited in the
work of some three hundred years ago.

In the matter of geographical record terrestrial globe
maps stand with the plane maps of the same period. While
they are by no means as numerous as the plane maps, there
attaches to them an importance no less historically significant.
Not infrequently they give us records not to be found
elsewhere. In their general features, differences can hardly
be said to exist between plane maps and globe maps. In the
matter of adornment there is similarity; each following the
practice of the time when constructed. As pictures and
legends hold a place of prominence, particularly on mediaeval
maps,201 so even to the close of the period we have had
under consideration, that is, the end of the eighteenth century,
these adornments have place on globe maps, sometimes
few, sometimes many, the same, if in picture, exhibiting the208
inhabitants of land and sea, if merely a legend, giving
information of geographical importance on the terrestrial
globe and of astronomical importance on the celestial, these
legends being often placed in an artistic cartouch.

To the printed or engraved globe map, color was generally
added by hand with an effect often very artistic, in contrast
with which the modern machine methods of color printing
are deplorably crude.

On most terrestrial globe maps meridian circles are represented
at intervals of ten, twenty, or thirty degrees, the
prime meridian on which the degrees of latitude are marked
being usually made very conspicuous, and to the close of the
period under consideration usually made to pass through the
Cape Verde Islands or the Canaries, a point always to be
carefully noted in attempting to get a reading for the longitude
of any particular place. Parallels are usually drawn at
intervals similar to those of meridians, the equator on which
the degrees of longitude are marked, the tropics, and the
polar circles being always conspicuous. The ecliptic or
zodiac is usually indicated encircling the globe from the
solstitial point on the tropics, intersecting the equator at
the two opposite equinoctial points, through which as
through the solstitial points the colures are made to pass.

Hues states that &#8220;Those lines which a ship, following the
direction of the Magnetic Needle, describeth on the surface
of the Sea, Petrus Nonius calleth in the Latin Rumbos,
borrowing the appellation of his Countrymen the Portugals;
which word, since it is now generally received by learned
writers to express them by, we also will use the same,&#8221; that
is, rhumbs or rhumb-lines.

These were represented on the globe, first by Mercator,
by greater or lesser circles or &#8220;winding lines,&#8221; and were
intended to be of aid to seamen in navigating from port to
port across the great oceans. In their representation on the
globe map cognizance was taken of the fact that all meridians
of all places pass through both poles, crossing the
209equator therefore at right angles and all other circles parallel
to it, and that if the navigator&#8217;s course is in any other direction
than toward one of the poles he is continually changing
his horizon and his meridian. The rhumbs as drawn were
made to cut all meridians of all places at equal angles and
to respect the same quarters of the world, that is, direction,
whatever the horizon. Rhumbs can represent great circles
only when they coincide with the equator or with any
meridian.202

In the matter of draughting, printing, and mounting celestial
globe gore maps the method employed may in general
be said to be identical with that followed in terrestrial
globe construction. It should, however, be noted that in
pasting the gores on the surface of the sphere they were
often so applied as to have their points or angles meet at
the pole of the ecliptic, in what may be called the ecliptic
system, instead of applying them to meet at the poles of
the equator, the globe itself being generally so mounted
as to revolve in the equatorial system, its poles of revolution
being attached to the meridian circle.203

The figures of the several constellations were usually
drawn with care, occasionally with high artistic taste, as
those drawn by Hevelius (Fig. 137) and copied by Gerhard
and Leonhard Valk for their celestial globes (Fig.
138). The several stars represented on the map, the majority
of them being either lettered or named, were usually from
the first to the sixth magnitude, each represented in its proportional
size, while an explanatory table for the several
magnitudes was usually given on some one of the gores.
The stars and the figures of the several constellations, let it
be noted, were not made to appear on the surface of the
sphere, with rare exceptions, in their relative location as
they appear to the observer who beholds them from his
position on the surface of the earth, but are reversed. To
the astronomer the earth is but a point in space, to the layman,
so far as mere appearance is concerned, it is the center210
about which the starry heavens appear to revolve. With the
pole (north for us in the northern hemisphere) as the center
of the dial face the stars appear to move in a direction the
reverse of that in which the hands of a clock are made to
move. The astronomer, that is, the celestial globe maker,
thinks of himself as placed beyond the vaulted heavens
in which the stars appear to be located, and as looking down
upon this vaulted dome as on the surface of his celestial
globe. An illustration may here well serve us. As one observes
serves Ursa Major on any starry night, which constellation
we commonly call the Great Dipper, the bowl of the dipper,
which is located in the body and flank of the bear, leads
in its apparent motion around the pole star, being followed
by the handle of the dipper or the tail of the bear (Fig.
139). On the surface of the celestial sphere, however, the
position of bowl and handle was usually reversed, the constellation
appearing as it would to the beholder who finds
himself beyond the stars. Naturally the planets could not be
represented on the surface of a solid celestial sphere; only
in the armillary sphere or the orrery could they find place. In
these instruments we generally find them represented, each211
with its circle or orbit properly given, and relatively
properly placed.

In the geographical records as they appear on the several
terrestrial globe maps, it is to be admitted that the authors,
with rare exceptions, undertook to set down what they
thought to be fact, shall we say the real tangible geographical
fact or facts. The maker of the star map, on the contrary,
clearly gave his imagination play, not in his attempt
to mark in the proper location the several stars as they came
to be known and catalogued, but in the draughting of the
figures of the several constellations. The imaginative figures
of the ancients, of Eudoxus, of Aratus, of Ptolemy and
others survived throughout the period we have had under
consideration, and to the forty-eight constellations of
Ptolemy others from time to time were added until more
than one hundred have been named and figured. In general
the several constellations, as the various astronomers and
makers of star maps have conceived them, may be said to
be identical, while some of the names which have been proposed
have been accepted but for a time only and then rejected.
Some of the groups to which names have been given
have later been divided, thus giving rise to a new group
name and to the draughting of an appropriate figure for this
new group.204

Attention has been called to certain suggested changes in
the names of constellations as given by the ancients, as for
example those suggested by the Venerable Bede, by Johannes
Bayer, by Julius Schiller proposing that biblical or
Christian names should be substituted for pagan names, and
for these changes there was of course suggested an appropriate
change in the figures for the several constellations.
The proposal of Erhard Weigel has likewise been noted urging
a substitution of the several coats of arms or heraldic
devices of the European dynasties for the figures which had
been so long and so generally accepted. There seems scarcely212
to be the need of stating that the names and figures of the
ancients remain.205

A comparison of the work of the several artists who have
set their hand to the draughting of figures for the numerous
constellations is not without interest. Attention may here
be directed in passing to the decidedly oriental cast of these
figures as they appear on Arabic globes.206

It is to be regretted that in the present very practical or
scientific day the star map, wanting the figures of the constellations
or giving them in but the faintest outline, has
come to supplant the artistic and not unscientific creations
of earlier years.

The earliest references we have to globes, that is, to solid
balls or spheres, make mention of their mountings, that is,
to their encasing circles and their bases. The simplest mounting
consisted of but a meridian and a horizon circle with
probably a simple supporting base. The earliest spheres
were doubtless made to revolve just as the globes of today,
around their polar axes which turn within sockets firmly
attached to the meridian circle. This meridian circle of
brass or wood was usually graduated from one to ninety
degrees, that is, from the equator to the poles, and being
adjustable relative to the horizon circle, a globe could be
set with a polar elevation for any desired latitude. Those
who have had occasion to refer to the construction and the
uses of the globe more or less in detail, make mention of
what they call its threefold position. In the first of these
positions either pole may be at the vertical point, the equator
and the horizon being parallel or coinciding. This they
termed a parallel sphere. In the second position the equator
and the horizon circle are set at right angles. This they
called a right sphere. In the third position, which was
called an oblique sphere, the pole could be set at any elevation
from zero to ninety degrees, counting from the horizon
circle. In illustration of this third position it may be
said that for the latitude of New York City, the north pole
213More conspicuous by reason of its width and importance
in the mounting of the globe than the meridian is the horizon
circle. It is through notches in this circle at the north and
south points that the meridian circle passes, the notches also
serving as gauges to keep the meridian from inclining more
to the one side of the horizon circle than to the other. On
the upper surface of this circle there were usually represented
several concentric circles, the same being either engraved
thereon, if it were of metal, and printed or pasted thereon
if of wood, just as the globe map proper which covered the
surface of the sphere. The number of concentric circles, and
the information carried in each, varied, nor was the order
of the circles invariably the same. Those globes giving fullest
information exhibit ten or more of these circles. That
one which was innermost and next to the body of the globe
was divided into twelve parts, each part carrying the name
of one of the signs of the zodiac with its character, and each
divided into thirty equal parts or degrees, these being numbered
by tens, as 0, 10, 20, 30. Next to the circle of signs,
always remembering that the order might vary, was that
containing the calendar including the names of the months,
as January, February, March, etc., the days of the week
being either distinguished by numbers or names. The old
calendar was likewise usually given and so represented as
to show the beginning of each month ten days earlier than
in the new calendar. Here also were given the names of the
church festival days. In the next circle were the names of
the winds or directions, and first the Greek, Latin or Italian
names of the eight, twelve or sixteen winds, as Greco,
Libeccio, Ponente, Maestro, and next the names or initials
of the thirty-two compass directions, the same generally in
English or Dutch abbreviations. It may further be noted
that a compass was often fixed in the horizon circle&#8217;s upper
face.214
of the globe should be elevated 40 degrees 48 minutes above
this circle.

A complete globe was further furnished with a quadrant
of altitude, ninety degrees in length, this being attached at
one end to the meridian circle, yet movable to any degree
of the meridian, though commonly set at the zenith. This
quadrant served for measuring altitudes or for finding amplitudes
or azimuths.

The small hour circle,207 fitted to the meridian, its center
being the pole and for us the north, was marked with the
twenty-four hours of the day, each hour being again divided
into halves and quarters. An index attached to the axis of the
globe pointed out successively the hours as the globe was
revolved. The use of this hour circle was to indicate the
time of the successive mutations, including the rising and
the setting of the celestial bodies and the time of their
passing successively the meridians.

As a compass was often set into the horizon circle so
also we frequently find a large or small compass set into
that plate which in certain globes was employed as a support,
tying together, as it were, the lower extremities of the
base columns.208

It will have been noted that the globes referred to in the
preceding pages varied greatly as to size, from the small
ball representing the earth, and but a few centimeters in
diameter, to be found in the center of those armillary spheres
representing the Ptolemaic geocentric system, to the great
globe of Coronelli fifteen feet in diameter constructed for
Louis XIV of France. With rare exceptions metal globes
were made small in size. Those globe balls or spheres, in the
construction of which a mould was employed, usually had a
diameter under 50 cm., although we find some of them
twice this size. Such spheres had the advantage of lightness
though often were frail in structure and liable to lose their
perfect sphericity.

In the matter of special ornamentation or decoration, to
be observed in globe mountings, individual taste was given
unlimited freedom to express itself, and in certain instances
215it will have been noted that these mountings were exceedingly
elaborate.

Primarily we may say that globes were constructed for
the useful purpose of promoting geographical and astronomical
studies, generally recording the latest and best
geographical or astronomical information and in form superior
to that which could be set down on the plane map, but
they also had a place of importance, secondary we may call
it, on account of their decorative value. They came to be
considered almost essential as adornments for the libraries
of princes, of prosperous patricians, and of plodding students,
and their mountings were often especially fashioned
for the places they were to occupy. They seemed to lend an
air of scholarly respectability; to suggest that their possessors
wished to pay, certainly a modicum of homage to
the sciences which globes were calculated to promote.

A brief concluding word may well be added touching
those globes which may of course be classed as celestial,
but which are known as moon globes and planetariums
or orreries. There could be no practical value in an attempt
to set forth a map of the surface of the stars, nor of the
planets while our knowledge is so limited, although Schiaparelli
has undertaken, with measurable success, to map the
surface of Mars,209 and it would be next in order to construct
a Mars globe. Of the surface of our moon much is
known and maps of it have been constructed, as indeed have
been moon globes. We are informed that about the middle
of the seventeenth century the Danish astronomer, Hevelius,
who designed so successfully star maps, entertained the
idea of constructing a moon globe,210 but we do not know
that he set his hand to the work. A century later it appears
that the French astronomer La Hire actually completed a
moon globe,211 but it has been possible to obtain only the
briefest reference to it.

Tobias Mayer of N&uuml;rnberg, a contemporary of La Hire,
set himself to the draughting of gore maps212 intended for use216
in the manufacture of moon globes. Mayer found employment
in the Homann establishment of N&uuml;rnberg, being regarded
as an exceedingly skilful draughtsman, able to sketch
on his draughting sheet that which he saw through his telescope.
His plan contemplated the making of twelve gores
or segments, six for the northern half of the moon and six
for the southern. His plan, of course, would enable him to
represent but one side of the moon,&mdash;that turned toward
the earth,&mdash;although it appeared that he contemplated the
addition of two segments on which, in at least a fragmentary
manner, he was to represent what we may call the
border of the opposite side of the moon. Mayer seems not
to have completed his work, since we find nowhere an
example of his finished product.

It was not until near the close of the eighteenth that we
again meet with an attempt to construct a moon globe and
it seems that the task was accomplished by the Englishman,
John Russel. It was in the year 1796 that he proposed
to raise by subscription the necessary funds for making his
undertaking a success. His globe has a diameter of 12
inches,213 and was furnished with the necessary adjustable
shield that the moon&#8217;s waxing and waning could be represented.
That this moon globe was actually constructed,
although no copy has been located, we are informed by
Wolf. Such attempts as were made in the nineteenth century
with a good measure of success do not here call for
consideration.

It has been previously noted that the so-called globe of
Archimedes may have been a sort of planetarium, and that
during the middle ages such instruments were constructed
and employed in astronomical instruction. None, however,
have come down to us out of those early years. Astronomers
of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, as we know,
made frequent use of planetariums, such for example as
were constructed by the Dutch astronomer, Christiaan
Haygens (1629-1695) for the illustration of planetary
217motion according to the Copernican system. Each of the
planets was represented in his machine by a small ball,
attached to an arm, which could be made to move through
an orbit around the sun. In the more complicated machines
the several planetary moons, such as the moons of Jupiter,
were represented and were made to perform their proper
motions.

In the eighteenth century the instrument maker, George
Graham (1675-1751), constructed a complicated planetarium,
in honor of Charles Boyle, Earl of Orrery (1676-1731),
which he called an orrery. His machines, varying
much in the character of construction, were especially popular
in the eighteenth century. The nineteenth century saw
them frequently in use for purposes of instruction and the
regret may well be expressed that for serious purposes they
seem to have lost favor.

201 Pictures are a particularly striking feature of the cloister maps of the
middle ages. The idea of such adornments may have come down from
Greek or Roman days. Plutarch tells us in his &#8216;Theseus&#8217; that &#8220;Geographers
crowd into the edge of their maps parts of the world about which they
have no knowledge, adding notes in the margins to the effect that only
deserts full of wild beasts and impassable marshes lie beyond.&#8221; Jonathan
Swift, humorously referring to maps of the early period, writes:




&#8220;So geographers in Afric maps
With savage pictures fill their gaps
And o&#8217;er unhabitable downs
Place elephants for want of towns.&#8221;


The early map makers as illustrators should be an interesting theme for a
special monograph.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
