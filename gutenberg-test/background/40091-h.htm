<h2>THE SOLUTION OF THE PYRAMID PROBLEM.</h2>


<p>With the firm conviction that the Pyramids of Egypt
were built and employed, among other purposes, for
one special, main, and important purpose of the greatest
utility and convenience, I find it necessary before I
can establish the theory I advance, to endeavor to determine
the proportions and measures of one of the
principal groups. I take that of Gïzeh as being the
one affording most data, and as being probably one of
the most important groups.</p>

<p>I shall first try to set forth the results of my investigations
into the peculiarities of construction of the
Gïzeh Group, and afterwards show how the Pyramids
were applied to the national work for which I believe
they were designed.</p>

<br>
<h3>§ 1. THE GROUND PLAN OF THE GIZEH GROUP.</h3>

<p>I find that the Pyramid Cheops is situated on the
acute angle of a right-angled triangle&mdash;sometimes called
the Pythagorean, or Egyptian triangle&mdash;of which base,
perpendicular, and hypotenuse are to each other as 3,
4, and 5. The Pyramid called Mycerinus, is situate on<span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span>
the greater angle of this triangle, and the base of the
triangle, measuring <i>three</i>, is a line due east from Mycerinus,
and joining perpendicular at a point due south of
Cheops. (<i>See Figure 1.</i>)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus-018a.jpg" width="300" height="206" alt="Cheops, Mycerīnus
" title="">
<span class="caption">Fig. 1.</span>
</div>
<p>I find that the Pyramid Cheops is also situate at the
acute angle of a right-angled triangle more beautiful
than the so-called triangle of Pythagoras, because more
practically useful. I have named it the 20, 21, 29 triangle.
Base, perpendicular, and hypotenuse are to each
other as twenty, twenty-one, and twenty-nine.</p>

<p>The Pyramid Cephren is situate on the greater angle
of this triangle, and base and perpendicular are as before
described in the Pythagorean triangle upon which
Mycerinus is built. (<i>See Fig. 2.</i>)</p>

</table></div>
<p><i>Figure 3</i> represents the combination,&mdash;A being
Cheops, F Cephren, and D Mycerinus.</p>

<p>Lines DC, CA, and AD are to each other as 3, 4,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span>
and 5; and lines FB, BA, and AF are to each other as
20, 21, and 29.</p>

<p>The line CB is to BA, as 8 to 7; the line FH is
to DH, as 96 to 55; and the line FB is to BC, as 5 to 6.</p>

<p>The Ratios of the first triangle multiplied by forty-five,
of the second multiplied by four, and the other
three sets by twelve, one, and sixteen respectively, produce
the following connected lengths in natural numbers
for all the lines.</p>

<p>Figure 4 connects another pyramid of the group&mdash;it
is the one to the southward and eastward of Cheops.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>In this connection, A Y Z A is a 3, 4, 5 triangle, and
B Y Z O B is a square.</p>


<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>I may also point out on the same plan that calling
the line FA radius, and the lines BA and FB sine and
co-sine, then is YA equal in length to versed sine of
angle AFB.</p>

<p>This connects the 20, 21, 29 triangle FAB with the
3, 4, 5 triangle AZY.</p>

<p>I have not sufficient data at my disposal to enable
me to connect the remaining eleven small pyramids
to my satisfaction, and I consider the four are sufficient for
my purpose.</p>

<br><h3>§ 2. THE ORIGINAL CUBIT MEASURE OF THE GIZEH GROUP.</h3>

<p>Mr. J. J. Wild, in his letter to Lord Brougham written
in 1850, called the base of Cephren seven seconds.
I estimate the base of Cephren to be just seven thirtieths
of the line DA. The line DA is therefore thirty
seconds of the Earth's Polar circumference. The line
DA is therefore 3033·118625 British feet, and the base
of Cephren 707·727 British feet.</p>

<p>I applied a variety of Cubits but found none to work
in <i>without fractions</i> on the beautiful set of natural dimensions
which I had worked out for my plan. (<i>See
table of connected natural numbers.</i>)</p>

<p>I ultimately arrived at a cubit as the ancient measure
which I have called the R.B. cubit, because it closely
resembles the Royal Babylonian Cubit of ·5131 metre,
or 1·683399 British feet. The difference is 1/600 of a foot.</p>

<p>I arrived at the R.B. cubit in the following manner.</p>

<p>Taking the polar axis of the earth at five hundred million
geometric inches, thirty seconds of the circumference
will be 36361·02608&mdash;geometric inches, or 36397·4235
British inches, at nine hundred and ninety-nine to the
thousand&mdash;and 3030·0855 geometric feet, or 3033·118625
British feet. Now dividing a second into sixty parts, there
are 1800 R.B. cubits in the line DA; and the line DA
being thirty seconds, measures 36397·4235 British inches,
which divided by 1800 makes one of my cubits 20·2207908
British inches, or 1·685066 British feet. Similarly,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>
36361·02608 geometric inches divided by 1800 makes
my cubit 20·20057 geometric inches in length. I have
therefore defined this cubit as follows:&mdash;One R.B.
cubit is equal to 20.2006 geo. inches, 20·2208 Brit.
inches, and 1·685 Brit. feet.</p>

<p>I now construct the following table of measures.</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align="center"> R. B. CUBITS.</td><td align="center">PLETHRA OR<br>SECONDS.</td><td align="center">STADIA.</td><td align="center">MINUTES.</td><td align="center">DEGREES.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"> 60</td><td align="center"> 1</td><td align="center"></td><td align="center"></td><td align="center"></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"> 360</td><td align="center"> 6</td><td align="center"> 1</td><td align="center"></td><td align="center"></td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"> 3600</td><td align="center"> 60</td><td align="center"> 10</td><td align="center"> 1</td><td align="center"></td></tr>

<tr><td align="center"> 77760000</td><td align="center"> 1296000</td><td align="center"> 216000</td><td align="center"> 21600</td><td align="center"> 360</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Thus there are seventy-seven million, seven hundred
and sixty thousand R.B. cubits, or two hundred and sixteen
thousand stadia, to the Polar circumference of the
earth.</p>

<p>Thus we have obtained a perfect set of natural and
convenient measures which fits the plan, and fits the
circumference of the earth.</p>

<p>And I claim for the R.B. cubit that it is the most
perfect ancient measure yet discovered, being the measure
of the plan of the Pyramids of Gïzeh.</p>

<p>The same forgotten wisdom which divided the circle
into three hundred and sixty degrees, the degree<span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span>
into sixty minutes, and the minute into sixty seconds,
subdivided those seconds, for earth measurements, into
the sixty parts represented by sixty R.B. cubits.</p>

<p>We are aware that thirds and fourths were used in
ancient astronomical calculations.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;">

<p>The reader will now observe that the cubit measures
of the main Pythagorean triangle of the plan are
obtained by multiplying the original 3, 4 and 5 by 360;
and that the entire dimensions are obtained in R.B. cubits
by multiplying the last column of connected natural
numbers in the table by eight,&mdash;thus&mdash;</p>

<p>According to Cassini, a degree was 600 stadia, a
minute 10 stadia; and a modern Italian mile, in the

<p>Dufeu also made a stadium the six hundredth part
of a degree. He made the degree 110827·68 metres,
which multiplied by 3·280841 gives 363607·996+ British
feet; and 363607·996+ divided by 600 equals 606·013327
feet to his stadium.</p>

<p>I make the stadium 606·62376 British feet.</p>

<p>There being 360 cubits to a stadium, Dufeu's stadium
divided by 360, gives 1·6833 British feet, which is the
exact measure given for a Royal Babylonian Cubit, if
reduced to metres, viz.: 0·5131 of a metre, and therefore
probably the origin of the measure called the Royal
Babylonian cubit. According to this measure, the Gïzeh
plan would be about 1/1011 smaller than if measured by
R.B. cubits.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>


<br><h3>§ 3. THE EXACT MEASURE OF THE BASES OF THE PYRAMIDS.</h3>

<p>A stadium being 360 R.B. cubits, or six seconds&mdash;and
a plethron 60 R.B. cubits, or one second, the base
of the Pyramid Cephren is seven plethra, or a stadium
and a plethron, equal to seven seconds, or four hundred
and twenty R.B. cubits.</p>

<p>Mycerinus' base is acknowledged to be half the base
of Cephren.</p>

<p>Piazzi Smyth makes the base of the Pyramid Cheops
9131·05 pyramid (or geometric) inches, which divided
by 20·2006 gives 452·01 R.B. cubits. I call it 452
cubits, and accept it as the measure which exactly fits
the plan.</p>

<p>I have not sufficient data to determine the exact base
of the other and smaller pyramid which I have marked
on my plan.</p>

<p>The bases, then, of Mycerinus, Cephren, and Cheops,
are 210, 420 and 452 cubits, respectively.</p>

<p>But in plan the bases should be reduced to one level.
I have therefore drawn my plan, or horizontal section,
at the level or plane of the base of Cephren, at which
level or plane the bases or horizontal sections of the
pyramids are&mdash;Mycerinus, 218 cubits, Cephren, 420
cubits, and Cheops, 420 cubits. I shall show how I
arrive at this by-and-by, and shall also show that the
horizontal section of Cheops, corresponding to the horizontal
section of Cephren at the level of Cephren's base,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
occurs, as it should do, at the level of one of the courses
of masonry, viz.&mdash;the top of the tenth course.</p>


<br><h3>§ 4. THE SLOPES, RATIOS, AND ANGLES OF THE THREE PRINCIPAL PYRAMIDS OF THE
GIZEH GROUP.</h3>

<p>Before entering on the description of the exact slopes
and angles of the three principal pyramids, I must
premise that I was guided to my conclusions by making
full use of the combined evolutions of the two wonderful
right-angled triangles, 3, 4, 5, and 20, 21, 29, which seem
to run through the whole design as a sort of dominant.</p>

<p>From the first I was firmly convinced that in such
skilful workmanship some very simple and easily applied
templates must have been employed, and so it turned
out. Builders do not mark a dimension on a plan which
they cannot measure, nor have a hidden measure of any
importance without some clear outer way of establishing
it.</p>

<p>This made me "go straight" for the slant ratios.
When the Pyramids were cased from top to bottom
with polished marble, there were only two feasible
measures, the bases and the apothems;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and for that
reason I conjectured that these would be the definite
plan ratios.</p>

<p>In Cheops, my dimensions agree with Piazzi Smyth&mdash;in
the base of Cephren, with Vyse and Perring&mdash;in
the height of Cephren, with Sir Gardner Wilkinson,
nearly&mdash;in the base of Mycerinus, they agree with the
usually accepted measures, and in the height of Mycerinus,
they exceed Jas. J. Wild's measure, by not quite
one of my cubits.</p>

<p>In my angles I agree very nearly with Piazzi Smyth,
for Cheops, and with Agnew, for Cephren, differing
about half a degree from Agnew, for Mycerinus, who
took this pyramid to represent the same relation of Π
that P. Smyth ascribes to Cheops (viz.: 51° 51′ 14·″3),
while he gave Cheops about the same angle which I ascribe
to Mycerinus.</p>

<p>I shall now show how I make Cephren and Cheops
of equal bases of 420 R.B. cubits at the same level,
viz.&mdash;that of Cephren's base.</p>

<p>John James Wild made the bases of Cheops, Cephren,
and Mycerinus, respectively, 80, 100, and 104·90 cubits
above some point that he called Nile Level.</p>

<p>His cubit was, I believe, the Memphis, or Nilometric
cubit&mdash;but at any rate, he made the base of Cephren
412 of them.</p>

<p>I therefore divided the recognized base of Cephren&mdash;viz.,
707·75 British feet&mdash;by 412, and got a result of
1·7178 British feet for his cubit. Therefore, his measures
multiplied by 1·7178 and divided by 1·685 will
turn his cubits into R.B. cubits.</p>

<p>I thus make Cheops, Cephren, and Mycerinus, respectively,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span>
81·56, 101·93, and 106·93 R.B. cubits above
the datum that J. J. Wild calls Nile Level. According
to Bonwick's "Facts and Fancies," p. 31, high water
Nile would be 138½ ft. below base of Cheops (or 82·19
R.B. cubits).</p>

<p>Piazzi Smyth makes the pavement of Cheops 1752
British inches (or 86·64 R.B. cubits) above <i>average
Nile Level</i>, but, by scaling his map, his <i>high Nile Level</i>
appears to agree nearly with Wild.</p>

<p>It is the <i>relative levels</i> of the Pyramids, however,
that I require, no matter how much above Nile
Level.</p>

<p>Cephren's base of 420 cubits being 101·93 cubits,
and Cheops' base of 452 cubits being 81·56 cubits above
Wild's datum, the difference in level of their bases
is, 20·37 cubits.</p>

<p>The ratio of base to altitude of Cheops being 330
to 210, therefore 20·37 cubits divided by 210 and multiplied
by 330 equals 32 cubits; and 452 cubits minus
32 cubits, equals 420.</p>

<p>Similarly, the base of Mycerinus is 5 cubits <i>above</i>
the base of Cephren, and the ratio of base to altitude
32 to 20; therefore, 5 cubits divided by 20 and multiplied
by 32 equals 8 cubits to be <i>added</i> to the 210
cubit base of Mycerinus, making it 218 cubits in
breadth at the level of Cephren's base.</p>

<p>Thus, a horizontal section or plan at the level of
Cephren's base would meet the slopes of the Pyramids
so that they would on plan appear as squares with sides<span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span>
equal to 218, 420, and 420 R.B. cubits, for Mycerinus,
Cephren, and Cheops, respectively.</p><br>

<p>Piazzi Smyth makes the top of the tenth course of
Cheops 414 pyramid inches above the pavement; and
414 divided by 20·2006 equals 20·49 R.B. cubits.</p>

<p>But I have already proved that Cheops' 420 cubit
base measure occurs at a level of 20·37 cubits above
pavement; therefore is this level the level of the top of
the tenth course, for the difference is only 0·12 R.B.

<p>He makes the present summit platform of Cheops
5445 pyramid inches above pavement. My calculation
of 269·80 R.B. cub. (See Fig. 21) is equal to 5450
pyramid inches&mdash;this is about 18 cubits below the
theoretical apex.</p>

<p>Figure 21 represents the comparative levels and
dimensions of Mycerinus, Cephren, and Cheops.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>The following peculiarities are noticeable:&mdash;That
Cheops and Cephren are of equal bases at the level of
Cephren's base;&mdash;that, at the level of Cheops' base, the
latter is only half a cubit larger;&mdash;that, from the level
of Mycerinus' base, Cheops is just double the height
of Mycerinus;&mdash;and that from the level of Cephren's
base, Cephren is just double the height of Mycerinus;
measuring in the latter case, however, only up to the
level platform at the summit of Cephren, which is said
to be about eight feet wide.</p>

<p>The present summit of Cephren is 23·07 cubits
above the present summit of Cheops, and the completed
apex of Cephren would be 8·21 cubits above the
completed apex of Cheops.</p>

<p>In the summit platforms I have been guided by
P. Smyth's estimate of <i>height deficient</i>, 363 pyr. inches,
for Cheops, and I have taken 8 feet base for Cephren's
summit platform.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>Herodotus states that "<i>the area of each of the four
faces of Cheops was equal to the area of a square
whose base was the altitude of a Pyramid;</i>" or, in
other words, that altitude was a mean proportional to
apothem and half base; thus&mdash;area of one face equals
the fourth of 330777·90 or 82694·475 R.B. cubits, and the
square root of 82694·475 is 287·56. But the correct
altitude is 287·77, so the error is 0·21, or 4¼ British
inches. I have therefore the authority of Herodotus to
support the theory which I shall subsequently set forth,
that this pyramid was the exponent of lines divided in
mean and extreme ratio.</p>

<p>By taking the dimensions of the Pyramid from what
I may call its <i>working level</i>, that is, the level of the base
of Cephren, this peculiarity shows more clearly, as also
others to which I shall refer. Thus&mdash;base of Cheops at
working level, 420 cubits, and apothem 340 cubits;
base area is, therefore, 176400 cubits, and area of one
face is (420 cubits, multiplied by half apothem, or 170
cubits) 71400 cubits. Now the square root of 71400
would give altitude, or side of square equal to altitude,
267·207784 cubits: but the real altitude is √(340²-210²)
= √71500 = 267·394839. So that the error of Herodotus's
proposition is the difference between √714 and
√715.</p>

<p>In the Pyramid Cheops, altitude is <i>very nearly</i> a
mean proportional between apothem and half base.
Apothem being 34, and half base 21, then altitude
would be √(34²-21²) = √715 = 26·7394839, and&mdash;</p>

<p>21 : 26·7394839 :: 26·7394839 : 34, nearly.</p>

<p>Here, of course, the same difference comes in as occurred
in considering the assumption of Herodotus, viz.,
the difference between √715 and √714; because if the
altitude were √714, then would it be <i>exactly</i> a mean
proportional between the half base and the apothem;
(thus, 21 : 26·72077 :: 26·72077 :: 34.)</p>

<br><h3>§ 6A. THE CASING STONES OF THE PYRAMIDS.</h3>

<p>Figures 23, 24, and 25, represent ordinary casing stones
of the three pyramids, and Figures 26, 27, and 28,
represent angle or quoin casing stones of the same.</p>

<p>The casing stone of Cheops, found by Colonel
Vyse, is represented in Bonwick's "Pyramid Facts and
Fancies," page 16, as measuring four feet three inches at
the top, eight feet three inches at the bottom, four feet<span class="pagenum">[Pg 33]</span>
eleven inches at the back, and six feet three inches at
the front. Taking four feet eleven inches as <i>Radius</i>,
and six feet three inches as <i>Secant</i>, then the <i>Tangent</i> is
three feet ten inches and three tenths.</p>

<p>Thus, in inches (√(75²-59²)) = 46·30 inches; therefore
the inclination of the stone must have been&mdash;slant
height 75 inches to 46·30 inches horizontal. Now,
46·30 is to 75, as 21 is to 34. Therefore, Col. Vyse's
casing stone agrees exactly with my ratio for the Pyramid
Cheops, viz., 21 to 34. (<i>See Figure 29.</i>)</p>

<p>This stone must have been out of plumb at the back
an inch and seven tenths; perhaps to give room for

not a necessity in good masonry that the back of a
stone should be exactly plumb, so long as the error is<span class="pagenum">[Pg 34]</span>

<p>Figure 59 represents such a template as the masons
would have used in building Cheops, both for dressing
and setting the stones. (The courses are drawn out of
proportion to the template.) The other pyramids must
have been built by the aid of similar templates.</p>

<p>Such large blocks of stone as were used in the casing
of these pyramids could not have been completely
dressed before setting; the back and ends, and the top
and bottom beds were probably dressed off truly, and
the face roughly scabbled off; but the true slope angle
could not have been dressed off until the stone had been
truly set and bedded, otherwise there would have been
great danger to the sharp arises.</p>

<br><h3>§ 8. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.</h3>

<p>It must be admitted that in the details of the building
of the Pyramids of Gïzeh there are traces of other
measures than R. B. cubits, but that the original cubit
of the plan was 1·685 British feet I feel no doubt. It
is a perfect and beautiful measure, fit for such a noble
design, and, representing as it does the sixtieth part of
a second of the Earth's polar circumference, it is and
was a measure for all time.</p>

<p>It may be objected that these ancient geometricians
could not have been aware of the measure of the
Earth's circumference; and wisely so, were it not for
two distinct answers that arise. The first being, that
since I think I have shown that Pythagoras never discovered
the Pythagorean triangle, but that it must have
been known and practically employed thousands of years
before his era, in the Egyptian Colleges where he
obtained his M.A. degree, so in the same way it is
probable that Eratosthenes, when he went to work to
prove that the earth's circumference was fifty times the
distance from Syene to Alexandria, may have obtained
the idea from his ready access to the ill-fated Alexandrian
Library, in which perhaps some record of the
learning of the builders of the Pyramids was stored.
And therefore I claim that there is no reason why the
pyramid builders should not have known as much about
the circumference of the earth as the modern world that
has calmly stood by in its ignorance and permitted<span class="pagenum">[Pg 39]</span>
those magnificent and, as I shall prove, useful edifices
to be stripped of their beautiful garments of polished
marble.</p>

<p>My second answer is that the correct cubit measure
may have been got by its inventors in a variety of other
ways; for instance, by observations of shadows of
heavenly bodies, without any knowledge even that the
earth was round; or it may have been evolved like the
British inch, which Sir John Herschel tells us is within
a thousandth part of being one five hundred millionth
of the earth's polar axis. I doubt if the circumference
of the earth was considered by the inventor of the
British inch.</p>

<p>It was a peculiarity of the Hindoo mathematicians
that they tried to make out that all they knew was <i>very
old</i>. Modern savants appear to take the opposite stand
for any little information they happen to possess.</p>

<p>The cubit which is called the Royal Babylonian
cubit and stated to measure O·5131 metre, differs so
slightly from my cubit, only the six-hundredth part of a
foot, that it may fairly be said to be the same cubit, and it
will be for antiquaries to trace the connection, as this
may throw some light on the identity of the builders of
the Pyramids of Gïzeh. Few good English two-foot
rules agree better than these two cubits do.</p>

<p>While I was groping about in the dark searching
for this bright needle, I tried on the plan many likely
ancient measures.</p>

<p>For a long time I worked in Memphis or Nilometric<span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span>
cubits, which I made 1·7126 British feet; they seem to
vary from 1·70 to 1·72, and although I made good use
of them in identifying other people's measures, still they
were evidently not in accordance with the design; but
the R.B. cubit of 1·685 British feet works as truly into
the plan of the Pyramids <i>without fractions</i> as it does
into the circumference of the earth.</p>

<p>Here I might, to prevent others from falling into one
of my errors, point out a rock on which I was
aground for a long time. I took the base of the Pyramid
Cheops, determined by Piazzi Smyth, from Bonwick's
"Pyramid Facts and Fancies" (a valuable little reference
book), as 763.81 British feet, and the altitude as
486.2567; and then from Piazzi Smyth's "Inheritance,"
page 27, I confirmed these figures, and so worked on
them for a long time, but found always a great flaw in
my work, and at last adopted a fresh base for Cheops,
feeling sure that Mr. Smyth's base was wrong: for I was
absolutely grounded in my conviction that at a certain
level, Cheops' and Cephren's measures bore certain relations
to each other. I subsequently found in another
part of Mr. Smyth's book, that the correct measures
were 761.65 and 484.91 British feet for base and altitude,
which were exactly what I wanted, and enabled me to
be in accordance with him in that pyramid which he
appears to have made his particular study.</p>

<p>For the information of those who may wish to compare
my measures, which are the results of an even or
regular circumference without fractions, with Mr. Smyth's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
measures, which are the results of an even or regular
diameter without fractions, it may be well to state that
there are just about 99 R.B. cubits in 80 of Piazzi
Smyth's cubits of 25 pyramid inches each.</p>


<br><h3>§ 9. THE PYRAMIDS OF EGYPT, THE THEODOLITES OF THE EGYPTIAN LAND SURVEYORS.</h3>

<p>About twenty-three years ago, on my road to Australia,
I was crossing from Alexandria to Cairo, and saw
the pyramids of Gïzeh.</p>

<p>I watched them carefully as the train passed along,
noticed their clear cut lines against the sky, and their
constantly changing relative position.</p>

<p>I then felt a strong conviction that they were built
for at least one useful purpose, and that purpose was
the survey of the country. I said, "Here be the Theodolites
of the Egyptians."</p>

<p>Built by scientific men, well versed in geometry, but
unacquainted with the use of glass lenses, these great
stone monuments are so suited in shape for the purposes
of land surveying, that the practical engineer or surveyor
must, after consideration, admit that they may
have been built mainly for that purpose.</p>

<p>Not only might the country have been surveyed by
these great instruments, and the land allotted at periodical
times to the people; but they, remaining always in
one position, were there to correct and readjust boundaries
destroyed or confused by the annual inundations of
the Nile.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>The Pyramids of Egypt may be considered as a
great system of landmarks for the establishment and
easy readjustment at any time of the boundaries of the
holdings of the people.</p>

<p>The Pyramids of Gïzeh appear to have been
main marks; and those of Abousir, Sakkârah, Dashow,
Lisht, Meydoun, &amp;c., with the great pyramids in Lake
Mœris, subordinate marks, in this system, which was
probably extended from Chaldea through Egypt into
Ethiopia.</p>

<p>The pyramid builders may perhaps have made the
entombment of their Kings one of their exoteric objects,
playing on the morbid vanity of their rulers to induce
them to the work, but in the minds of the builders
before ever they built must have been planted the intention
to make use of the structures for the purposes of
land surveying.</p>

<p>The land of Egypt was valuable and maintained a
dense population; every year it was mostly submerged,
and the boundaries destroyed or confused. Every
soldier had six to twelve acres of land; the priests had
their slice of the land too; after every war a reallotment
of the lands must have taken place, perhaps every
year.</p>

<p>While the water was lying on the land, it so softened
the ground that the stone boundary marks must have
required frequent readjustment, as they would have been
likely to fall on one side.</p>

<p>By the aid of their great stone theodolites, the surveyors,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span>
who belonged to the priestly order, were able
to readjust the boundaries with great precision. That
all science was comprised in their secret mysteries may
be one reason why no hieroglyphic record of the scientific
uses of the pyramids remains. It is possible that at
the time of Diodorus and Herodotus, (and even when
Pythagoras visited Egypt,) theology may have so
smothered science, that the uses of the pyramids may
have been forgotten by the very priests to whom in
former times the knowledge belonged; but "a respectful
reticence" which has been noticed in some of these old
writers on pyramid and other priestly matters would
rather lead us to believe that an initiation into the mysteries
may have sealed their lips on subjects about which
they might otherwise have been more explicit.</p>

<p>The "<i>closing</i>" of one pyramid over another in
bringing any of their many lines into true order, must
even now be very perfect;&mdash;but now we can only
imagine the beauties of these great instrumental wonders
of the world when the casing stones were on them.
We can picture the rosy lights of one, and the bright
white lights of others; their clear cut lines against the
sky, true as the hairs of a theodolite; and the sombre
darkness of the contrasting shades, bringing out their
angles with startling distinctness. Under the influence
of the Eastern sun, the faces must have been a very
blaze of light, and could have been seen at enormous
distances like great mirrors.</p>

<p>I declare that the pyramids of Gïzeh in all their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
polished glory, before the destroyer stripped them
of their beautiful garments, were in every respect
adapted to flash around clearly defined lines of sight,
upon which the lands of the nation could be accurately
threaded. The very thought of these mighty theodolites
of the old Egyptians fills me with wonder and
reverence. What perfect and beautiful instruments
they were! never out of adjustment, always correct,
always ready; no magnetic deviation to allow for. No
wonder they took the trouble they did to build them so
correctly in their so marvellously suitable positions.</p>

<p>If Astronomers agree that observations of a
pole star could have been accurately made by peering
up a small gallery on the north side of one of the pyramids
only a few hundred feet in length, I feel that
I shall have little difficulty in satisfying them that
accurate measurements to points only <i>miles</i> away could
have been made from angular observations of the whole
group.</p>


<br><h3>§ 10. HOW THE PYRAMIDS WERE MADE USE OF.</h3>

<p>It appears from what I have already set forth that
the plan of the Pyramids under consideration is
geometrically exact, a perfect set of measures.</p>

<p>I shall now show how these edifices were applied to
a thoroughly geometrical purpose in the true meaning
of the word&mdash;to measure the Earth.</p>

<p>I shall show how true straight lines could be
extended from the Pyramids in given directions useful<span class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span>
in right-angled trigonometry, by direct observation
of the buildings, and without the aid of other instruments.</p>

<p>And I shall show how by the aid of a simple instrument
angles could be exactly observed from any
point.</p>

<p>This Survey theory does not stand or fall on the
merits of my theory of the Gïzeh plan. Let it be
proved that this group is not built on the exact system
of triangulation set forth by me, it is still a fact that its
plan is in a similar shape, and any such shape would
enable a surveyor acquainted with the plan to lay down
accurate surveys by observations of the group even
should it not occupy the precise lines assumed by me.</p>

<p>And here I must state that although the lines
of the plan as laid down herein agree nearly with the
lines as laid down in Piazzi Smyth's book, in the
Penny Cyclopædia, and in an essay of Proctor's in the
<i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, still I find that they do not agree
at all satisfactorily with a map of the Pyramids in
Sharp's "Egypt," said to be copied from Wilkinson's
map.</p>

<p>We will, however, for the time, and to explain my
survey theory, suppose the plan theory to be correct, as
I firmly believe it is.</p>

<p>And then, supposing it may be proved that the
respective positions of the pyramids are slightly different
to those that I have allotted to them on my
plan, it will only make a similar slight difference to<span class="pagenum">[Pg 46]</span>
the lines and angles which I shall here show could be
laid out by their aid.</p>

<p>Let us in the first place comprehend clearly the
shape of the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>A sector or fan, with a long handle&mdash;the fan or
sector, the delta; and the handle of the fan, the Nile
Valley, running nearly due south.</p>

<p>The Pyramids of Gïzeh are situate at the angle of
the sector, on a rocky eminence whence they can all be
seen for many miles. The summits of the two high
ones can be seen from the delta, and from the Nile
Valley to a very great distance; how far, I am unable
to say; but I should think that while the group could
be made general use of for a radius of fifteen miles, the
summits of Cephren and Cheops could be made use of
for a distance of thirty miles; taking into consideration
the general fall of the country.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that if meridian observations of
the star Alpha of the Dragon could be made with
accuracy by peeping up a small hole in one of the
pyramids, then surely might the surveyors have carried
true north and south lines up the Nile Valley as far as
the summit of Cheops was visible, by "<i>plumbing in</i>"
the star and the apex of the pyramid by the aid of
a string and a stone.</p>

<p>True east and west lines could have been made to
intersect such north and south lines from the various
groups of pyramids along the river banks, by whose aid
also such lines would be prolonged.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>Next, supposing that their astronomers had been
aware of the latitude of Cheops, and the annual northing
and southing of the sun, straight lines could have
been laid out in various sectoral directions to the north-eastward
and north-westward of Cheops, across the
delta, as far as the extreme apex of the pyramid was
visible, by observations of the sun, rising or setting
over his summit. (That the Dog-star was observed in
this manner from the north-west, I have little doubt.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 360px;">
<img src="images/illus-061.jpg" width="360" height="342" alt="Fig. 37. Sun above Pyramid and sinking behind Pyramid
" title=""></div>

<p>For this purpose, surveyors would be stationed at
suitable distances apart with their strings and their
stones, ready to catch the sun simultaneously, and at
the very moment he became transfixed upon the apex
of the pyramid, and was, as it were, "swallowed by it."
(<i>See Figure 37</i>.) The knowledge of the pyramid slope
angle from different points of view would enable the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 48]</span>
surveyor to place himself in readiness nearly on the
line.</p>

<p>Surely such lines as these would be as true and as
perfect as we could lay out nowadays with all our
modern instrumental appliances. A string and a stone
here, a clean-cut point of stone twenty miles away, and
a great ball of fire behind that point at a distance of
ninety odd million miles. The error in such a line
would be very trifling.</p>

<p>Such observations as last mentioned would have
been probably extended from Cephren for long lines, as
being the higher pyramid above the earth's surface, and
may have been made from the moon or stars.</p>

<p>In those days was the sun the intimate friend of
man. The moon and stars were his hand-maidens.</p>

<p>How many of us can point to the spot of the sun's
rising or setting? We, with our clocks, and our
watches, and our compasses, rarely observe the sun or
stars. But in a land and an age when the sun was the
only clock, and the pyramid the only compass, the
movements and positions of the heavenly bodies were
known to all. These people were <i>familiar</i> with the
stars, and kept a watch upon their movements.</p>

<p>How many of our vaunted educated population
could point out the Dog-star in the heavens?&mdash;but the
whole Egyptian nation hailed his rising as the beginning
of their year, and as the harbinger of their annual
blessing, the rising of the waters of the Nile.</p>

<p>It is possible therefore that the land surveyors of
Egypt made full use of the heavenly bodies in their
surveys of the land; and while we are pitifully laying
out our new countries by the circumferenter and the
compass, we presume to speak slightingly of the supposed
dark heathen days, when the land of Egypt was
surveyed by means of the sun and the stars, and the
theodolites were built of stone, with vertical limbs five
hundred feet in height, and horizontal limbs three thousand
feet in diameter.</p>

<p>Imagine half a dozen such instruments as this in a
distance of about sixty miles (for each group of pyramids
was effectually such an instrument), and we can
form some conception of the perfection of the surveys
of an almost prehistoric nation.</p>

<p>The centre of Lake Mœris, in which Herodotus tells
us two pyramids stood 300 feet above the level of the
lake, appears from the maps to be about S. 28° W., or S.
29° W. from Gïzeh, distant about 57 miles, and the Meidân
group of pyramids appears to be about 33 miles
due south of Gïzeh.</p>

<p>Figures 38, 39, 40 and 41, show that north-west,
south-east, north-east, and south-west lines from the
pyramids could be extended by simply plumbing the
angles. These lines would be run in sets of two's and
three's, according to the number of pyramids in the
group; and their known distances apart at that angle
would check the correctness of the work.</p>

<p>A splendid line was the line bearing 43° 36′ 10·15″,
or 223° 36′ 10·15″ from Cheops and Cephren, the pyramids<span class="pagenum">[Pg 50]</span>
covering each other, the line of hypotenuse of the
great 20, 21, 29 triangle of the plan. This I call the
20, 21 line. <i>(See Figure</i> 42.)</p>

<p>Figure 43 represents the 3, 4, 5 triangle line from
the summits of Mycerinus and Cheops in true line bearing
216° 52' 11·65". This I call the south 4, west 3 line.</p>

<p>The next line is what I call the 2, 1 line, and is
illustrated by figure 44. It is one of the most perfect
of the series, and bears S. 26° 33' 54·9" W. from the
apex of Cephren. This line demonstrates clearly why
Mycerinus was cased with red granite.</p>

<p>Not in memory of the beautiful and rosy-cheeked
Nitocris, as some of the tomb theory people say, but for
a less romantic but more useful object; simply because,
from this quarter, and round about, the lines of the
pyramids would have been confused if Mycerinus had
not been of a different color. The 2, 1 line is a line in
which Mycerinus would have been absolutely lost in
the slopes of Cephren but for his red color. There is
not a fact that more clearly establishes my theory, and
the wisdom and forethought of those who planned the
Gïzeh pyramids, than this red pyramid Mycerinus, and
the 2, 1 line.</p>

<p>Hekeyan Bey, speaks of this pyramid as of a "<i>ruddy
complexion</i>;" John Greaves quotes from the Arabic
book, Morat Alzeman, "<i>and the lesser which is coloured</i>;"
and an Arabic writer who dates the Pyramids
three hundred years before the Flood, and cannot find
among the learned men of Egypt "<i>any certain relation
concerning them</i>" nor any "<i>memory of them amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
men</i>," also expatiates upon the beauties of the "<i>coloured
satin</i>" covering of this one particular pyramid.</p>

<p>I must content myself with the preceding examples
of a few pyramid lines, but must have said enough to
show that from every point of the compass their appearance
was distinctly marked and definitely to be
determined by surveyors acquainted with the plan.</p>


<br><h3>§ <a name="Survey" id="Survey"></a>11. DESCRIPTION OF THE ANCIENT PORTABLE SURVEY INSTRUMENT.</h3>

<p>I must now commence with a single pyramid, show
how approximate observations could be made from it,
and then extend the theory to a group with the observations
thereby rendered more perfect and delicate.</p>

<p>We will suppose the surveyor to be standing looking
at the pyramid Cephren; he knows that its base is<span class="pagenum">[Pg 52]</span>
420 cubits, and its apothem 346½ cubits. He has provided
himself with a model in wood, or stone, or metal, and
one thousandth of its size&mdash;therefore his model will be
O.42 cubit base, and O.3465 cubit apothem&mdash;or, in
round numbers, eight and half inches base, and seven
inches apothem.</p>

<p>This model is fixed on the centre of a card or
disc, graduated from the centre to the circumference,
like a compass card, to the various points of the compass,
or divisions of a circle.</p>

<p>The model pyramid is fastened due north and south
on the lines of this card or disc, so that when the north
point of the card points north, the north face of the
model pyramid faces to the north.</p>

<p>The surveyor also has a table, which, with a pair of
plumb lines or mason's levels, he can erect quite level:
this table is also graduated from the centre with divisions
of a circle, or points of the compass, and it is larger
than the card or disc attached to the model.</p>

<p>This table is made so that it can revolve upon its
stand, and can be clamped. We will call it the <i>lower
limb</i>. There is a pin in the centre of the lower limb,
and a hole in the centre of the disc bearing the model,
which can be thus placed upon the centre of the table,
and becomes the <i>upper limb</i>. The upper limb can be
clamped to the lower limb.</p>

<p>The first process will be to clamp both upper and
lower limbs together, with the north and south lines of
both in unison, then revolve both limbs on the stand till<span class="pagenum">[Pg 53]</span>
the north and south line points straight for the pyramid
in the distance, which is done by the aid of sights
erected at the north and south points of the perimeter
of the lower limb. When this is adjusted, clamp the
lower limb and release the upper limb; now revolve the
upper limb until the model pyramid exactly covers the
pyramid in the distance, and shows just the same shade
on one side and light on the other, when viewed from
the sights of the clamped lower limb&mdash;and the lines,
angles, and shades of the model coincide with the lines,
angles, and shades of the pyramid observed;&mdash;now
clamp the upper limb. Now does the model stand
really due north and south, the same as the pyramid in
the distance; it throws the same shades, and exhibits
the same angles when seen from the same point of
view; just as much of it is in shade and as much of it
is in light as the pyramid under observation; therefore
it must be standing due north and south, because Cephren
himself is standing due north and south, and the
upper limb reads off on the lower limb the angle or
bearing observed.</p>

<p>So far we possess an instrument equal to the modern
circumferenter, and yet we have only brought one pyramid
into work.</p>

<p>If I have shown that such an operation as the above
is practically feasible, if I have shown that angles can
be taken with moderate accuracy by observing one
pyramid of 420 cubits base, how much more accurate
will the observation be when the surveyor's plane table<span class="pagenum">[Pg 54]</span>
bears a group of pyramids which occupy a representative
space of about 1400 cubits when viewed from the south
or north, and about 1760 cubits when viewed from the
east or west. If situated a mile or two south of the
Gïzeh group our surveyor could also tie in and perfect
his work by sights to the Sâkkarah group with Sâkkarah
models; and so on, up the Nile Valley, he would find
every few miles groups of pyramids by aid of which he
would be enabled to tie his work together.</p>

<p>If the Gïzeh group of pyramids is placed and shaped
in the manner I have described, it must be clear that an
exact model and plan, say a thousandth of the size, could
be very easily made&mdash;the plan being at the level of the
base of Cephren where the bases of the two main
pyramids are even;&mdash;and if they are not exactly so
placed and shaped, it may be admitted that their position
and dimensions were known to the surveyors or priests,
so that such models could be constructed. It is probable,
therefore, that the instrument used in conjunction with
these pyramids, was a machine constructed in a similar
manner to the simple machine I have described, only
instead of there being but one model pyramid on the
disc or upper limb, it bore the whole group; and the
smaller pyramids were what we may call vernier points
in this great circle, enabling the surveyor to mark off
known angles with great accuracy by noticing how, as
he worked round the group of pyramids, one or other
of the smaller ones was covered by its neighbours.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>
<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> See general plan of Gïzeh Group op. page 1.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>The immensity of the main pyramids would require
the smaller ones to be used for surveys in the immediate
neighbourhood, as the surveyor might easily
be too close to get accurate observations from the main
pyramids.</p>

<p>The upper limb, then, was a disc or circular plate
bearing the model of the group.</p>

<p>Cheops would be situated in the centre of the circle,
and observations would be taken by bringing the whole
model group into even line and even light and shade
with the Gïzeh group.</p>

<p>I believe that with a reasonable-sized model occupying
a circle of six or seven feet diameter, such as a
couple of men could carry, very accurate bearings could
have been taken, and probably were taken.</p>

<p>The pyramid shape is the very shape of all others
to employ for such purposes. A cone would be useless,
because the lights and shades would be softened off and
its angles from all points would be the same. Other
solids with perpendicular angles would be useless,
because although they would vary in width from different
points of view they would not present that ever changing
angle that a pyramid does when viewed from different
directions.</p>

<p>After familiarity with the models which I have made
use of in prosecuting these investigations, I find that I
can judge with great accuracy <i>from their appearance
only</i> the bearing of the group from any point at which
I stand. I make bold to say that the pocket compass<span class="pagenum">[Pg 56]</span>
of the Egyptian surveyor was a little model of the group
of pyramids in his district, and he had only to hold it
up on his hand and turn it round in the sun till its
shades and angles corresponded with the appearance of
the group, to tell as well as we could tell by our compasses,
perhaps better, his bearing from the landmarks
that governed his surveys.</p>

<p>The Great Circle of Gold described by Diodorus
(<i>Diod. Sic. lib. X., part 2, cap. 1</i>) as having been employed
by the Egyptians, and on which was marked
amongst other things, the position of the rising and
setting of the stars, and stated by him to have been
carried off by Cambysses when Egypt was conquered
by the Persians, is supposed by Cassini to
have been also employed for finding the meridian
by observation of the rising and setting of the sun.
This instrument and others described by writers
on Egypt would have been in practice very similar
to the instrument which I have described as having
been probably employed for terrestrial observations.</p>

<p>The table or disc comprising the lower limb of the
instrument, might have been supported upon a small
stand with a circular hole in the centre, so arranged that
the instrument could be either set up alone and supported
by its own tripod, or rested fairly on the top of
any of those curious stone boundary marks which were
made use of, not only to mark the corners of the different
holdings, but to show the level of the Nile inundations.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 57]</span>
(<i>See Figure 49, copied from Sharpe's Egypt,</i>
<i>vol. I., p</i>. 6.) The peculiar shape of the top of these
stone landmarks, or "sacred boundary stones," appears
suitable for such purposes, and it would have been a
great convenience to the surveyor, and conducive to
accuracy, that it should be so arranged that the instrument
should be fixed immediately over the mark, as
appears probable from the shape of the stone.</p>

</div>
<p>A noticeable point in this theory is, that it is not in
the least essential that the apex of a pyramid should be
complete. If their summits were left permanently flat,
they would work in for survey purposes quite as well,
and I think better, than if carried to a point, and they
would be more useful with a flat top for defined shadows
when used as sun dials.</p>

<p>In the Gïzeh group, the summit of Cheops appears
to me to have been left incomplete the better to get the
range with Cephren for lines down the delta.</p>

<p>In this system of surveying, there is always a beautiful
connection between the horizontal bearings and the
apparent or observed angles presented by the slopes and
edges of the pyramid. Thus, in pyramids like those of
Gïzeh, which stand north and south, and whose meridional
sections contain less, and whose diagonal sections
contain more than a right angle, the vertex being the
point at which the angle is measured&mdash;this law holds:&mdash;
That<span class="pagenum">[Pg 58]</span>
the smallest interior angle at the vertex, contained
between the inside edge and the outside
edge, will exhibit the same angle as the bearing
of the observer's eye from the apex of the
pyramid <i>when the angle at the apex contained
by the outside edges appears to be a right angle</i>.</p>

<p>Figures 50 to 55 inclusive illustrate this beautiful law from which it
will be seen that the Gïzeh surveyors possessed, in this manner alone,
eight distinctly defined bearings from each pyramid.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;">

<p>I recommend any one desirous to thoroughly comprehend
these matters, to make a plan from my diagram,
<i>Figure</i> 5, using R.B. cubits for measures, and to a suitable
scale, on a piece of card-board. Then to cut out
of the card-board the squares of the bases of the pyramids
at the level of Cephren, viz., 420, 420 and 218
cubits respectively, for the three main pyramids.
One hundred cubits to the inch is a convenient scale and
within the limits of a sheet of Bath board.</p>

<p>By striking out the models on card-board in the
manner shown by diagrams (<i>see Figures</i> 56, 57, and 58)
they can be cut out with a penknife&mdash;cutting only <i>half<span class="pagenum">[Pg 60]</span>
through</i> where the lines are <i>dotted</i>&mdash;bent up together,
and pasted along the edges with strips of writing paper
about half an inch wide.</p>

<p>These models can be dropped into the squares cut
out of the card-board plan, thus correcting the error
caused by the thickness of the card-board base, and if
placed in the sun, or at night by the light of <i>one</i> lamp
or candle properly placed to represent the sun in the
eastward or westward, the clear cut lines and clear contrasting
shades will be manifest, and the lines illustrated
by my figures can be identified.</p>

<p>When inspecting the model, it is well to bear in
mind that the eye must be kept very nearly level with
the table, or the pyramids will appear as if viewed from
a balloon.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;">

<p>I believe that the stones were got up to the building
by way of the north side of each pyramid. The casing
on the south, east, and west, was probably built up as
the work proceeded, and the whole of these three faces
were probably thus finished and completed while there
was not a single casing stone set on the north side.
Then the work would be closed up until there remained
nothing but a great gap or notch, wide at the bottom,
and narrowing to the apex. The work on the north
side would then be closed from the sides and top, and
the bottom casing stone about the centre of the north
side, would be the last stone set on the building.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 61]</span>
These old builders were too expert not to have thus
made use of all the shade which their own building
would thus afford to a majority of the workmen.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;">

<p>Many of the obelisks were probably marks on pyramid
lines of survey.</p>

<p>The pyramid indeed may have been a development
of the obelisk for this purpose.</p>

<p>Their slanting sides might correspond with some of
the nearly upright slant angles of the pyramids, in positions
opposite certain lines. Reference to several of
my figures will show how well this would come in.</p>

<p>Herodotus speaks of two obelisks at Heliopolis, and
Bonwick tells us that Abd al Latif saw two there which
he called Pharaoh's Needles. An Arab traveller, in
1190, saw a pyramid of copper on the summit of the
one that remained, but it is now wanting. Pharaoh's
Needles appear to have been situated about 20 miles
NE. of the Gïzeh group, and their slope angles might
have coincided with the apparent slope angles of Cephren
or Cheops on the edge nearest the obelisk.</p>

<p>The ancient method of describing the meridian by
means of the shadow of a ball placed on the summit of
an obelisk points to a reasonable interpretation for the
peculiar construction of the two pillars, Jachin and
Boaz, which are said to have been situated in front of
the Hebrew Temple at Jerusalem, and about which so
much mysterious speculation has occurred.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>They were no doubt used as sun-dials for the morning
and afternoon sun by the shadow of the balls or
"chapiters" thrown upon the pavement.</p>

<p>Without presuming to dispute the objects assigned
by others for the galleries and passages which have been
discovered in the pyramid Cheops, I venture to opine
that they were employed to carry water to the builders.
They are connected with a well, and the well with the
Nile or canal. Whether the water was slided up the
smooth galleries in boxes, or whether the cochlea, or
water screw, was worked in them, their angles being
suitable, it is impossible to conjecture; either plan
would have been convenient and feasible.</p>

<p>These singular chambers and passages may indeed
possibly have had to do with some hydraulic machinery
of great power which modern science knows nothing
about. The section of the pyramid, showing these
galleries, in the pyramid books, has a most hydraulic
appearance.</p>

<p>The tremendous strength and regularity of the cavities
called the King's and Queen's chambers, the regularity
and the <i>smallness</i> of most of the passages or massive
stone connecting pipes, favor the idea that the chambers
might have been reservoirs, their curious roofs,
air chambers, and the galleries or passages, connecting
pipes for working water under pressure. Water raised
through the passages of this one pyramid nearest to the
canal, might have been carried by troughs to the other
pyramids, which were in all probability in course of construction<span class="pagenum">[Pg 63]</span>
at the same period of time. A profane friend
of mine thinks that the sarcophagus or "sacred coffer"
in the King's chamber may have been used by the chief
architect and leading men of the works as a <i>bath</i>, and
that the King's chamber was nothing more or less
than a delightful bath room.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;">

<p>The following quotation from the writing of an
Arabian author (Ibn Abd Alkokm), is extracted from
Bonwick's "Pyramid Facts and Fancies," page 72:&mdash;"The
Coptites mention in their books that upon them
(the Pyramids) is an inscription engraven; the exposition
of it in Arabicke is this:&mdash;'I, Saurid the King
built the Pyramids (in such and such a time), and
finished them in six years; he that comes after me, and
says he is equal to me, let him destroy them in six
hundred years; and yet it is known that it is easier to
pluck down than to build; <i>and when I had finished
them, I covered them with sattin, and let him cover them
with slats.</i>'"</p>

<p>The italics are my own. The builder seems to have
entertained the idea that his work would be partially
destroyed, and afterwards temporarily repaired or
rebuilt. The first part has unfortunately come true,
and it is possible that the last part of the idea of King
Saurid may be carried out, because it would not be so
very expensive an undertaking for any civilized nation
in the interest of science to re-case the pyramids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
of Gïzeh, so that they might be once more applied
to land-surveying purposes in the ancient manner.</p>

<p>It would not be absolutely necessary to case the
whole of the pyramid faces, so long as sufficient casing
was put on to define the angles. The "<i>slats</i>" used
might be a light wooden framework covered with thin
metal. The metal should be painted white, except
in the case of Mycerinus, which should be of a reddish
color.</p>

<p>Reference to <i>Fig. 60</i> and the preceding table, will
show that the main triangular dimensions of this plan
(imperfect as it is from the lack of eleven pyramids)
are represented by four main triangles, viz:&mdash;</p>

<p>Figures 30 to 36 illustrate the two former, and <i>Figures</i>
61 and 62 illustrate the two latter. I will call triangles
of this class "primary triangles," as the most suitable
term, although it is applied to the main triangles of
geodetic surveys.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>We have only to select a number of such triangles
and a system of trigonometry ensues, in which base,
perpendicular, and hypotenuse of every triangle is a
whole measure without fractions, and in which the
nomenclature for every angle is clear and simple.</p>

<p>An angle of 43° 36′ 10·15″ will be called a 20, 21
angle, and an angle of 36° 52′ 11·65″ will be called a
3, 4 angle, and so on.</p>

<p>In the existing system whole angles, such as 40, 45,
or 50 degrees, are surrounded by lines, most of which
can only be described in numbers by interminable
fractions.</p>

<p>In the ancient system, lines are only dealt with, and
every angle in the table is surrounded by lines measuring
whole units, and described by the use of a couple of
simple numbers.</p>

<p>Connecting this with our present system of trigonometry
would effect a saving in calculation, and general
use of certain peculiar angles by means of which
all the simplicity and beauty of the work of the ancients
would be combined with the excellences of our modern
instrumental appliances. Surveyors should appreciate
the advantages to be derived from laying out traverses
on the hypotenuses of "primary" triangles, by the
saving of calculation and facility of plotting to be obtained
from the practice.</p>

<p>The key to these old tables is the fact, that in "primary"
triangles the right-angled triangle formed by the
sine and versed sine, also by the co-sine and co-versed-sine,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 67]</span>
is one in which base and perpendicular are measured
by numbers without fractions. These I will call
"satellite" triangles.</p>

<p>Thus, to the "primary" triangle 20, 21, 29, the ratios
of the co-sinal and sinal satellites are respectively 7 to 3,
and 2 to 5. (<i>See Figure 35.</i>) To the 48, 55, 73 triangle
the satellites are 11, 5 and 8, 3 (<i>Fig. 62</i>); to the 3, 4, 5
triangle they are 2, 1 and 3, 1 (<i>Fig. 30</i>); and to the 28,
45, 53 triangle, they are 9, 5 and 7, 2 (<i>Fig. 61</i>). The
primary triangle, 7, 24, 25, possesses as satellites the
"primary" triangle, 3, 4, 5, and the ordinary triangle,
4, 1; and the primary triangle 41, 840, 841, is attended
by the 20, 21, 29 triangle, as a satellite with the ordinary
triangle 41, 1, and so on.</p>

</div>
<p>Since any ratio, however, whose terms, one or both,
are represented by fractions, can be transformed into
whole numbers, it evidently follows that every conceivable<span class="pagenum">[Pg 68]</span>
relative measure of two lines which we may decide
to call co-sine and co-versed-sine, becomes a satellite to
a corresponding "primary" triangle.</p>

<p>Now, since the angle of the satellite on the circumference
must be <i>half</i> the angle of the adjacent primary
triangle at the centre, it follows that in constructing a
list of satellites and their angles, the angles of the corresponding
primary triangles can be found. For instance&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
Satellite 8, 3, contains 20° 33′ 21·76″<br>
Satellite 2, 7, contains 15° 56′ 43·425″
</Blockquote>

<p>Each of these angles doubled, gives the angle of a
"primary" triangle as follows, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
The 48, 55, 73 triangle = 41°  6′ 43·52″<br>
The 28, 45, 53 triangle = 31° 53′ 26·85″
</blockquote>

<p>The angles of the satellites together must always be
45°, because the angle at the circumference of a quadrant
must always be 135°.</p>

<p>From the Gïzeh plan, as far as I have developed it,
the following order of satellites begins to appear, which
may be a guide to the complete Gïzeh plan ratio, and
to those "primary" triangles in use by the pyramid
surveyors in their ordinary work.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>Having found the lowest ratio of the three sides of
a "primary" triangle, the lowest whole numbers for
tangent, secant, co-secant, and co-tangent, if required,
are obtained in the following manner.</p>

<p>Take for example the 20, 21, 29 triangle, now
20 × 21 = 420, and 29 × 420 = 12180, a new radius instead
of 29 from which with the sine 20, and co-sine 21,
increased in the same ratio, the whole canon of the
20, 21, 29 triangle will come out in whole numbers.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>Similarly in the triangle 48, 55, 73, radius 73 × 13200
(the product of 48 × 55) makes radius in whole numbers
963600, for an even canon without fractions. This is
because sine and co-sine are the two denominators in
the fractional parts of the other lines when worked out
at the lowest ratio of sine, co-sine, and radius.</p>

<p>After I found that the plan of the Gïzeh group was
a system of "primary" triangles, I had to work out the
rule for constructing them, for I had never met with it
in any book, but I came across it afterwards in the
"Penny Encyclopedia," and in Rankine's "Civil Engineering."</p>

<p>The practical utility of these triangles, however, does
not appear to have received sufficient consideration. I
certainly never met with any except the 3, 4, 5, in the
practice of any surveyor of my acquaintance.</p>

<p>(For squaring off a line nothing could be more convenient
than the 20, 21, 29 triangle; for instance, taking
a base of 40 links, then using the whole chain for
the two remaining sides of 42 and 58 links.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>It seems probable that could I add to my pyramid
plan the lines and triangles that the missing eleven pyramids
would supply, it would comprise a complete table
on which would appear indications of all the ratios and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
triangles made use of in right-angled trigonometry, a
"<i>ratiometer</i>" in fact.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that so far as I have gone it is correct&mdash;and
it is possible, therefore, with the start that I
have made, for others to continue the work, and add the
eleven pyramids to the plan in their correct geometrical
position. By continuing the system of evolution by
which I defined the position of Cephren, and the little
pyramid to the south-east of Cheops, after I had obtained
Cheops and Mycerinus, may be rebuilt, at one
and the same time, a skeleton of the trigonometrical
tables of a forgotten civilization, and the plan of those
pyramids which are its only link with the present age.</p>


<br><h3>§ 13. THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF THE PYRAMIDS INDICATED BY THE PLAN.</h3>

<p>I pursued my investigations into the slopes and altitudes
of the pyramids without reference to the plan,
after once deciding their exact bases.</p>

<p>Now it will be interesting to note some of the ways
in which the plan hints at the shape and size of these
pyramids, and corroborates my work.</p>

<p>The dimensions of <i>Cheops</i> are indicated on the plan
by the lines EA to YA, measuring 840 and 288 R.B.
cubits respectively, being the half periphery of its horizontal
section at the level of Cephren's base, and its
own altitude from its own base. (<i>See Fig</i>. 5.)</p>

<p>The line EA, in fact, represents in R.B. cubits the
half periphery of the bases of either Cheops or Cephren<span class="pagenum">[Pg 78]</span>
measured at the level which I have set forth as the
<i>plan level</i>, viz., base of Cephren.</p>

<p>The ratio of Cephren's base to Cephren's altitude is
indicated on the plan by the ratios of the lines BC to
EB, or FO to OR, viz., 32 to 21. (<i>See Fig.</i> 4.)</p>

<p>The altitude of Mycerinus above Cephren's base
appears on plan in the line EF, measuring 136 R.B.
cubits.</p>

<p>The line EO on plan measures 888 cubits, which
would be the length of a line stretched from the apex
of Cheops to the point E, at the level of Cheops' base.</p>

<p>This merits consideration:&mdash;the lines EA and AY
are connected on plan at the centre of Cheops, and the
lines EO and EA are connected on plan at the point E.</p>

<p>Now the lines EO, EA and AY are sides of a "primary
triangle," whose ratio is 37, 35, 12, and whose
measure in cubits is 888, 840, and 288; and if we suppose
the line EA to be stretched horizontally beneath
the pyramids at the level of the base of Cheops from
E to A on plan, and the line AY to be a plumb line
hanging from the apex of Cheops to the level of his
base, then will the line EO just stretch from the point
E to the apex of Cheops, and the three lines will connect
the two main pyramids by a vertical triangle of
which EA, AY and EO form the base, perpendicular,
and hypotenuse. Or, to explain it in another manner:
let the line EA be a <i>cord</i> stretching horizontally from
A at the centre of the base of Cheops to the point E,
both ends being at the same level; let the line AY be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
<i>rod</i>, lift it on the end A till it stands erect, then is the
end Y the apex of Cheops. Now, the line EO would
just stretch from the top of the rod AY to the point
E first described.</p>

<p>It is a singular coincidence, and one that may be
interesting to students of the <i>interior</i> of the Pyramids,
that the side EP, of the small 3, 4, 5 triangle, EP,
PF, FE, in the centre of the plan, measures 81·60 R.B.
cubits, which is very nearly eight times the "<i>true
breadth</i>" of the King's chamber in Cheops, according
to Piazzi Smyth; for 81·60/8 = 10·20 R.B. cubits, or
206·046 pyramid inches (one R.B. cubit being 20·2006
pyramid inches). The sides of this little triangle measure
81·60, 108·80, and 136, R.B. cubits respectively, as
can be easily proved from the plan ratio table.</p>


<br><h3>§ 14. A SIMPLE INSTRUMENT FOR LAYING OFF "PRIMARY TRIANGLES."</h3>

<p>A simple instrument for laying off "primary triangles"
upon the ground, might have been made with
three rods divided into a number of small equal divisions,
with holes through each division, which rods
could be pinned together triangularly, the rods working
as arms on a flat table, and the pins acting as pointers
or sights.</p>

<p>One of the pins would be permanently fixed in the
table through the first hole of two of the rods or arms,
and the two other pins would be movable so as to fix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the arms into the shape of the various "primary triangles."</p>

<p>Thus with the two main arms pinned to the cross
arm in the 21st and 29th hole from the permanently
pinned end, with the cross arm stretched to twenty divisions,
a 20, 21, 29 triangle would be the result, and
so on.</p>


<br><h3>§ 14<i>a</i>. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.</h3>

<p>I must be excused by geometricians for going so
much in detail into the simple truths connected with
right-angled trigonometry. My object has been to
make it very clear to that portion of the public not
versed in geometry, that the Pyramids of Egypt must
have been used for land surveying by right-angled triangles
with sides having whole numbers.</p>

<p>A re-examination of these pyramids on the ground
with the ideas suggested by the preceding pages in
view, may lead to interesting discoveries.</p>

<p>For instance, it is just possible that the very accurately
and beautifully worked stones in the walls of the
King's chamber of Cheops, may be found to indicate
the ratios of the rectangles formed by the bases and perpendiculars
of the triangulations used by the old surveyors&mdash;that
on these walls may be found, in fact, corroboration
of the theory that I have set forth. I am led
to believe also from the fact that Gïzeh was a central
and commanding locality, and that it was the custom of
those who preceded those Egyptians that history tells<span class="pagenum">[Pg 81]</span>
of, to excavate mighty caverns in the earth&mdash;that, therefore,
in the limestone upon which the pyramids are
built, and underneath the pyramids, may be found vast
excavations, chambers and galleries, that had entrance
on the face of the ridge at the level of High Nile.
From this subterraneous city, occupied by the priests
and the surveyors of Memphis, access may be found to
every pyramid; and while to the outside world the
pyramids might have appeared sealed up as mausoleums
to the Kings that it may have seen publicly interred
therein, this very sealing and closing of the outer
galleries may have only rendered their mysterious
recesses more private to the priests who entered from
below, and who were, perhaps, enabled to ascend by private
passages to their very summits. The recent discovery
of a number of regal mummies stowed away in
an out of the way cave on the banks of the Nile, points
to the unceremonious manner in which the real rulers
of Kings and people may have dealt with their sovereigns,
the pomp and circumstance of a public burial
once over. It is just possible that the chambers in the
pyramids may have been used in connection with their
mysteries: and the small passages called by some "ventilators"
or "air passages," sealed as they were from
the chamber by a thin stone (and therefore no ventilators)
may have been <i>auditory passages</i> along which
sound might have been projected from other chambers
not yet opened by the moderns; sounds which were
perhaps a part of the "hanky panky" of the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
ceremonial connected with the "mysteries" or the "religion"
of that period.</p>

<p>Down that "well" which exists in the interior of
Cheops, and in the limestone foundations of the pyramid,
should I be disposed to look for openings into the
vast subterraneous chambers which I am convinced <i>do</i>
exist below the Pyramids of Gïzeh.</p>

<p>The priests of the Pyramids of Lake Mœris had
their vast subterranean residences. It appears to me
more than probable that those of Gïzeh were similarly
provided. And I go further:&mdash;Out of these very
caverns may have been excavated the limestone of
which the pyramids were built, thus killing two birds
with one stone&mdash;building the instruments and finding
cool quarters below for those who were to make use of
them. In the bowels of that limestone ridge on which
the pyramids are built will yet be found, I feel convinced,
ample information as to their uses. A good
diamond drill with two or three hundred feet of rods is
what is what is wanted to test this, and the solidity of
the pyramids at the same time.</p>


<br><h3>§ 15. PRIMARY TRIANGULATION.</h3>

<p>Primary triangulation would be useful to men of
almost every trade and profession in which tools or
instruments are used. Any one might in a short time
construct a table for himself answering to every degree
or so in the circumference of a circle for which only
forty or fifty triangles are required.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>It would be worth while for some one to print and
publish a correct set of these tables embracing a close
division of the circle, in which set there should be a
column showing the angle in degrees, minutes, seconds
and decimals, and also a column for the satellite, thus&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

</table></div>

<p>and so on. Such a set of tables would be a boon to
sailors, architects, surveyors, engineers, and all handi-craftsmen:
and I make bold to say, would assist in the
intricate investigations of the astronomer:&mdash;and the
rule for building the tables is so simple, that they could
easily be achieved. The architect from these tables
might arrange the shape of his chambers, passages or
galleries, so that all measures, not only at right angles
on the walls, but from any corner of floor to ceiling
should be even feet. The pitch of his roofs might be
more varied, and the monotony of the buildings relieved,
with rafters and tie-beams always in even measures.
The one solitary 3, 4, 5 of Vitruvius would cease to be
his standard for a staircase; and even in doors and
sashes, and panels of glass, would he be alive to the
perfection of rectitude gained by evenly-measured diagonals.
By a slight modification of the compass card,
the navigator of blue water might steer his courses on
the hypotenuses of great primary triangles&mdash;such tables
would be useful to all sailors and surveyors who have
to deal with latitude and departure. For instance, familiarity<span class="pagenum">[Pg 84]</span>
with such tables would make ever present in
the mind of the surveyor or sailor his proportionate
northing and easting, no matter what course he was
steering between north and east, "the <i>primary</i>" embraces
the <i>three ideas in one view</i>.</p>

<p>In designing trussed roofs or bridges, the "primaries"
would be invaluable to the engineer, strain-calculations
on diagonal and upright members would be
simplified, and the builder would find the benefit of a
measure in even feet or inches from centre of one pin
or connection to another.</p>

<p>For earthwork slopes 3, 4, 5; 20, 21, 29; 21, 20, 29;
and 4, 3, 5 would be found more convenient ratios than
1 <i>to</i> 1, and 1½ <i>to</i> 1, etc. Templates and battering rules
would be more perfect and correct, and the engineer
could prove his slopes and measure his work at one
and the same time without the aid of a staff or level;
the slope measures would reveal the depth, and the
slope measures and bottom width would be all the
measures required, while the top width would prove the
correctness of the slopes and the measurements.</p>

<p>To the land surveyor, however, the primary triangle
would be the most useful, and more especially to those
laying out new holdings, whether small or large, in new
countries.</p>

<p>Whether it be for a "squatter's run," or for a town
allotment, the advantages of a diagonal measure to
every parallelogram in even <i>miles</i>, <i>chains</i>, or <i>feet</i>, should
be keenly felt and appreciated.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>This was, I believe, <i>one</i> of the secrets of the speedy
and correct replacement of boundary marks by the
Egyptian land surveyors.</p>

<p>I have heard of a review in the "Contemporary,"
September, 1881, referring to the translation of a papyrus
in the British Museum, by Dr. Eisenlohr&mdash;"<i>A
handbook of practical arithmetic and geometry," etc., "such
as we might suppose would be used by a scribe acting as
clerk of the works, or by an architect to shew the working
out of the problems he had to solve in his operations</i>."
I should like to see a translation of the book, from which
it appears that "<i>the clumsiness of the Egyptian method
is very remarkable</i>." Perhaps this Egyptian "<i>Handbook</i>"
may yet shew that their operations were not so
"<i>clumsy</i>," as they appear at first sight to those accustomed
to the practice of modern trigonometry. I may
not have got the exact "hang" of the Egyptian method
of land surveying&mdash;for I do not suppose that even their
"clumsy" method is to be got at intuitively; but I claim
that I have shewn how the Pyramids could be used for
that purpose, and that the subsidiary instrument described
by me was practicable.</p>

<p>I claim, therefore, that the theory I have set up,
that the pyramids were the theodolites of the Egyptians,
is sound. That the ground plan of these pyramids
discloses a beautiful system of primary triangles
and satellites I think I have shown beyond the shadow
of a doubt; and that this system of geometric triangulation
or right-angled trigonometry was the method practised,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 86]</span>
seems in the preceding pages to be fairly established.
I claim, therefore, that I have discovered and
described the main secret of the pyramids, that I have
found for them at last a practical use, and that it is no
longer "<i>a marvel how after the annual inundation, each
property could have been accurately described by the aid
of geometry.</i>" I have advanced nothing in the shape of
a theory that will not stand a practical test; but to do
it, the pyramids should be <i>re-cased</i>. Iron sheeting, on
iron or wooden framework, would answer. I may be
wrong in some of my conclusions, but in the main I am
satisfied that I am right. It must be admitted that I
have worked under difficulties; a glimpse at the pyramids
three and twenty years ago, and the meagre library
of a nomad in the Australian wilderness having been all
my advantages, and time at my disposal only that
snatched from the rare intervals of leisure afforded by
an arduous professional life.</p>

<p>After fruitless waiting for a chance of visiting Egypt
and Europe, to sift the matter to the bottom, I have at
last resolved to give my ideas to the world as they stand;
crude necessarily, so I must be excused if in some details
I may be found erroneous; there is truth I know
in the general conclusions. I am presumptuous enough
to believe that the R.B. cubit of 1·685 British feet was
the measure of the pyramids of Gïzeh, although there
may have been an astronomical 25 inch cubit also. It
appears to me that no cubit measure to be depended on
is either to be got from a stray measuring stick found<span class="pagenum">[Pg 87]</span>
in the joints of a ruined building, or from any line or
dimensions of one of the pyramids. I submit that a
most reasonable way to get a cubit measure out of the
Pyramids of Gïzeh, was to do as I did:&mdash;take them as a
whole, comprehend and establish the general ground
plan, find it geometric and harmonic, obtain the ratios
of all the lines, establish a complete set of natural and
even numbers to represent the measures of the lines,
and finally bring these numbers to cubits by a common
multiplier (which in this case was the number eight).
After the whole proportions had been thus expressed
in a cubit evolved <i>from</i> the whole proportions, I established
its length in British feet by dividing the base of
Cephren, as known, by the number of my cubits representing
its base. It is pretty sound evidence of the
theory being correct that this test, with 420 cubits neat
for Cephren, gave me also a neat measure for Cheops,
from Piazzi Smyth's base, of 452 cubits, and that at the
same level, these two pyramids become equal based.</p>

<p>I have paid little attention to the inside measurements.
I take it we should first obtain our exoteric
knowledge before venturing on esotoric research. Thus
the intricate internal measurements of Cheops, made by
various enquirers have been little service to me, while
the accurate measures of the base of Cheops by Piazzi
Smyth, and John James Wild's letter to Lord Brougham,
helped me amazingly, as from the two I established
the plan level and even bases of Cheops and
Cephren at plan level&mdash;as I have shown in the preceding<span class="pagenum">[Pg 88]</span>
pages. My theory demanded that both for the
building of the pyramids and for the construction of the
models or subsidiary instruments of the surveyors, simple
slope ratios should govern each building; before I
conclude, I shall show how I got at my slope ratios, by
evolving them from the general ground plan.</p>

<p>I am firmly convinced that a careful investigation
into the ground plans of the various other groups of
pyramids will amply confirm my survey theory&mdash;the relative
positions of the groups should also be established&mdash;much
additional light will be then thrown on the subject.</p>

<p>Let me conjure the investigator to view these piles
<i>from a distance</i> with his mind's eye, as the old surveyors
viewed them with their bodily eye. Approach them
too nearly, and, like Henry Kinglake, you will be lost
in the "<i>one idea of solid immensity.</i>" Common sense
tells us they were built to be viewed from a distance.</p>

<p>Modern surveyors stand <i>near</i> their instruments, and
send their flagmen to a distance; the Egyptian surveyor
was <i>one of his own flagmen</i>, and his instruments
were towering to the skies on the distant horizon.
These mighty tools will last out many a generation of
surveyors.</p>

<p>The modern astronomer from the top of an observatory
points his instruments direct at the stars; the
Egyptian astronomer from the summit of his particular
pyramid directed his observations to the rising and setting
of the stars, or the positions of the heavenly bodies<span class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</span>
in respect to the far away groups of pyramids scattered
around him in the distance; and by comparing notes,
and with the knowledge of the relative position of the
groups, did these observers map out the sky. Solar and
lunar shadows of their own pyramids on the flat
trenches prepared for the purpose, enabled the astronomer
at each observatory to record the annual and
monthly flight of time, while its hours were marked by
the shadows of their obelisks, capped by copper
pyramids or balls, on the more delicate pavements
of the court-yards of their public buildings.</p>

<p>We must grasp that their celestial and terrestrial
surveys were almost a reverse process to our own,
before we can venture to enquire into its details. It
then becomes a much easier tangle to unravel. That a
particular pyramid among so many, should have been
chosen as a favoured interpreter of Divine truths, seems
an unfair conclusion to the other pyramids;&mdash;that the
other pyramids were rough and imperfect imitations,
appears to my poor capacity "a base and impotent
conclusion;"&mdash;(as far as I can learn, <i>Mycerinus</i>, in its
perfection, was a marvel of the mason's art;) but that
one particular pyramid should have anything to do with
the past or the future of the lost ten tribes of Israel
(whoever that fraction of our present earthly community
may be), seems to me the wildest conclusion of all,
except perhaps the theory that this one pyramid points
to the future of the British race. Yet in one way
do I admit that the pyramids point to our future.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>Thirty-six centuries ago, they, already venerable
with antiquity, looked proudly down on living labouring
Israel, in helpless slavery, in the midst of an advanced
civilization, of which the history, language, and religion
are now forgotten, or only at best, slightly understood.</p>

<p>Thirty-six centuries hence, they may look down on a
civilization equally strange, in which our history, language,
and religion, Hebrew race, and British race, may
have no place, no part.</p>

<p>If the thoughts of noble poets live, as they seem to
do, old Cheops, that mountain of massive masonry,
may (like the brook of our Laureate), in that dim
future, still be singing, as he seems to sing now, this
idea, though not perhaps these words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For men may come, and men may go,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But I go on for ever."<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Ars longa, vita brevis." Man's work remains, when
the workman is forgotten; fair work and square, can
never perish entirely from men's minds, so long as the
world stands. These pyramids were grand and noble
works, and they will not perish till their reputation has
been re-established in the world, when they will live
in men's memories to all generations as symbols of the
mighty past. To the minds of many now, as to Josephus
in his day, they are "<i>vast and vain monuments,</i>"
records of folly. To me they are as monuments of
peace, civilization and order&mdash;relics of a people living
under wise and beneficent rulers&mdash;evidences of cultivation,
science, and art.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>


<br><h3>§ 16. THE PENTANGLE OR FIVE POINTED STAR THE GEOMETRIC SYMBOL OF THE GREAT PYRAMID.</h3>

<p>From time immemorial this symbol has been a
blazing pointer to grand and noble truths, and a solemn
emblem of important duties.</p>

<p>Its geometric significance, however, has long been
lost sight of.</p>

<p>It is said to have constituted the seal or signet
of King Solomon (1000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), and in early times it was
in use among the Jews, as a symbol of safety.</p>

<p>It was the Pentalpha of Pythagoras, and the Pythagorean
emblem of health (530 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>).</p>

<p>It was carried as the banner of Antiochus, King of
Syria (surnamed Soter, or the Preserver), in his wars
against the Gauls (260 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>). Among the Cabalists, the
star with the sacred name written on each of its points,
and in the centre, was considered talismanic; and
in ancient times it was employed all over Asia as a
charm against witchcraft. Even now, European troops
at war with Arab tribes, sometimes find, under the
clothing, on the breasts of their slain enemies, this
ancient emblem, in the form of a metal talisman, or
charm.</p>

<p>The European Göethe puts these words into the
mouth of Mephistopheles:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I am hindered egress by a quaint device upon the threshold,&mdash;that
five-toed damned spell."</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>I shall set forth the geometric significance of this star,
as far as my general subject warrants me, and show that
it is the <i>geometric emblem of extreme and mean ratio</i>, and
the <i>symbol of the Egyptian Pyramid Cheops</i>.</p>

<p>A plane geometric star, or a solid geometric pyramid,
may be likened to the corolla of a flower, each
separate side representing a petal. With its petals
opened and exposed to view, the flower appears in all
its glorious beauty; but when closed, many of its
beauties are hidden. The botanist seeks to view it flat
or open in its geometric symmetry, and also closed, as a
bud, or in repose:&mdash;yet judges and appreciates the one
state from the other. In the same manner must we deal
with the five pointed star, and also with the Pyramid
Cheops.</p>

<p>In dealing with so quaint a subject, I may be
excused, in passing, for the quaint conceit of likening
the interior galleries and chambers of this pyramid
to the interior whorl of a flower, stamens and pistil,
mysterious and incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Figure 67 (page 101), is the five pointed star,
formed by the unlapping of the five slant sides of a
pyramid with a pentagonal base.</p>

<p>Figure 70 (page 106), is a star formed by the unlapping
of the four slant sides of the pyramid Cheops.</p>

<p>The pentagon GFRHQ, (<i>Fig.</i> 67) is the base of the
pyramid "<i>Pentalpha</i>" and the triangles EGF, BFR,
ROH, HNQ and QAG, represent the five sides, so that
supposing the lines GF, FR, RH, HQ and QG, to be<span class="pagenum">[Pg 93]</span>
hinges connecting these sides with the base, then by
lifting the sides, and closing them in, the points A, E,
B, O, and N, would meet over the centre C.</p>

<p>Thus do we close the geometric flower Pentalpha,
and convert it into a pyramid.</p>

<p>In the same manner must we lift the four slant sides
of the pyramid Cheops from its star development,
(<i>Fig.</i> 70) and close them in, the four points meeting
over the centre of the base, forming the solid pyramid.
Such transitions point to the indissoluble connection
between plane and solid geometry.</p>

<p>As the <i>geometric emblem of extreme and mean ratio</i>,
the pentangle appears as an assemblage of lines divided
the one by the others <i>in extreme and mean ratio</i>.</p>

<p>To explain to readers not versed in geometry, what
extreme and mean ratio signifies, I refer to Figure 65:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 216px;">
<img src="images/illus-113.jpg" width="216" height="125" alt="" title="">
<span class="caption">Fig. 65.
</span>
</div>

<blockquote><p>Let AB be the given line to be divided in extreme and mean ratio,
<i>i.e.</i>, so that the whole line may be to the greater part, as the
greater is to the less part.</p></blockquote>

<p>Draw BC perpendicular to AB, and equal to half AB.
Join AC; and with BC as a radius from C as a centre,
describe the arc DB; then with centre A, and radius<span class="pagenum">[Pg 94]</span>
AD, describe the arc DE; so shall AB be divided in E,
in extreme and mean ratio, or so that AB: AE:: AE:
EB. (Note that AE is equal to the side of a decagon
inscribed in a circle with radius AB.)</p>

<p>Let it be noted that since the division of a line in
mean and extreme ratio is effected by means of the 2, 1
triangle, ABC, therefore, as the exponent of this ratio,
another reason presents itself why it should be so important
a feature in the Gïzeh pyramids in addition to
its connection with the primary triangle 3, 4, 5.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 288px;">
<img src="images/illus-114.jpg" width="288" height="257" alt="" title="">
<span class="caption">Fig. 66.
</span>
</div>

<p>To complete the explanation offered with figure 65,
I must refer to Fig. 66, where in constructing a pentagon,
the 2, 1 triangle ABC, is again made use of.</p>

<blockquote><p>The line AB is a side of the pentagon. The line
BC is a perpendicular to it, and half its length.
The line AC is produced to F, CF being made
equal to CB; then with B as a centre, and radius
BF, the arc at E is described; and with A as a
centre, and the same radius, the arc at E is intersected,
their intersection being the centre of the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 95]</span>
circle circumscribing the pentagon, and upon
which the remaining sides are laid off.</p></blockquote>

<p>We will now refer to figure 67, in which the pentangle
appears as the symbolic exponent of the division
of lines in extreme and mean ratio.</p>

<p>The question now arises, does this pyramid Cheops
set forth by the relations of its altitude to perimeter of<span class="pagenum">[Pg 101]</span>
base the ratio of diameter to circumference; or, does it
set forth mean proportional, and extreme and mean
ratio, by the proportions of its apothem, altitude, and
half-base? The answer is&mdash;from the practical impossibility
of such extreme accuracy in such a mass of
masonry, that it points alike to all, and may as fairly be
considered the exponent of the one as of the others.
Piazzi Smyth makes Cheops 761·65 feet base, and
484·91 feet altitude, which is very nearly what he calls
a Π pyramid, for which I reckon the altitude would be
about 484·87 feet with the same base: and for a pyramid
of extreme and mean ratio the altitude would be
484·34 feet.</p>

<p>The whole difference, therefore, is only about six
inches in a height of nearly five hundred feet. This
difference, evidently beyond the power of man to discover,
now that the pyramid is a ruin, would even in its
perfect state have been inappreciable.</p>

<p>It appears most probable that the star Pentalpha
led to the star Cheops, and that the star Cheops
(<i>Fig</i>. 70) was the plan used by the ancient architect,
and the ratio of 34 to 21, hypotenuse to base, the template
used by the ancient builders.</p>

<p>Suppose some king said to his architect, "Make me
a plan of a pyramid, of which the base shall be 420
cubits square, and altitude shall be to the perimeter of
the base as the radius of a circle to the circumference."&mdash;Then
might the architect prepare an elaborate plan
in which the relative dimensions would be about<span class="pagenum">[Pg 102]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>The king then orders another pyramid, of the same
base, of which altitude is to be a mean proportional between
apothem and half-base&mdash;and apothem and half-base
taken as one line are to be in mean and extreme
ratio.</p>

<p>The architect's plan of this pyramid will be the
simple figure illustrated by me (<i>Fig</i>. 70), and the

<p>and neither king nor architect could detect error in the
work.</p>

<p>The reader will remember that I have previously
advanced that the level of Cephren's base was the plan
level of the Gïzeh pyramids, and that at this level the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 103]</span>
base of Cheops measures 420 R.B. cubits&mdash;same as the
base of Cephren.</p>

<p>This hypothesis is supported by the revelations of
the pentangle, in which the ratio of 34 to 21 = apothem
340 to half-base 210 R.B. cubits, is so nearly approached.</p>

<p>Showing how proportional lines were the order of
the pyramids of Gïzeh, we will summarise the proportions
of the three main pyramids as shewn by my dimensions
and ratios, very nearly, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Mycerinus. Base : Apothem :: Altitude : Half-Base.</i></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">as shown by the ratios, (<i>Fig</i>. 13), 40 : 32 :: 25 : 20.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Cephren. Diagonal of Base : Edge :: Edge : Altitude.</i></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">as shown by ratios, (<i>Fig</i>. 12), 862 : 588 :: 588 : 400.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Cheops. (Apothem + Half Base): Apoth. :: Apoth. : Half Base.</i></span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">as shown by the ratios, (<i>Fig</i>. 9), 55 : 34 :: 34 : 21.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">and&mdash;<i>Apothem : Altitude :: Altitude : Half-B.</i></span><br>
</p>

<p>Similar close relations to other stars may be found in
other pyramids. Thus:&mdash;<i>Suppose NHO of figure 69 to
be the NHO of a heptangle instead of a pentangle</i>, then
does NH represent apothem, and NO represent base of
the pyramid Mycerinus, while the co-sine of the angle
NHM (being MH minus versed sine) will be equal to
the altitude of the pyramid. The angle NHM in the
heptangle is, 38° 34′ 17·142″, and according to my plan
of the pyramid Mycerinus, the corresponding angle is
38° 40′ 56″. (<i>See Fig</i>. 19.) This angular difference of
0° 6′ 39″ would only make a difference in the apothem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
of the pyramid of <i>eight inches</i>, and of <i>ten inches</i> in its
altitude (apothem being 283 <i>ft</i>. 1 <i>inch</i>, and altitude
221 <i>ft</i>.).</p>


<br><h3>§ 17. THE MANNER IN WHICH THE SLOPE RATIOS OF THE PYRAMIDS WERE ARRIVED
AT.</h3>

<p>The manner in which I arrived at the Slope Ratios
of the Pyramids, viz., 32 <i>to</i> 20, 33 <i>to</i> 20, and 34 <i>to</i> 21,
for <i>Mycerinus</i>, <i>Cephren</i>, and <i>Cheops</i>, respectively (<i>see
Figures</i> 8, 7 <i>and</i> 6), was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>First, believing in the connection between the relative
positions of the Pyramids on plan (<i>see Fig</i>. 3, 4 <i>or</i>
5), and their slopes, I viewed their positions thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mycerinus, situate at the angle of the 3, 4, 5 triangle
ADC, is likely to be connected with that "primary"
in his slopes.</p>

<p>Cephren, situate at the angle of the 20, 21, 29 triangle
FAB, and strung, as it were, on the hypotenuse
of the 3, 4, 5 triangle DAC, is likely to be connected
with <i>both</i> primaries in his slopes.</p>

<p>Cheops, situate at the point A, common to both
main triangles, governing the position of the other
pyramids, is likely to be a sort of mean between these
two pyramids in his slope ratios.</p>

<p>Reasoning thus, with the addition of the knowledge
I possessed of the angular estimates of these slopes
made by those who had visited the ground, and a useful
start for my ratios gained by the reduction of base
measures already known into R.B. cubits, giving 420 as<span class="pagenum">[Pg 105]</span>
a general base for Cheops and Cephren at one level,
and taking 210 cubits as the base of Mycerinus (half
the base of Cephren, as generally admitted), I had
something solid and substantial to go upon. I commenced
with Mycerinus. (<i>See Fig</i>. 71.)</p>

<span class="caption">(Mycerīnus) Fig. 71.
</span>
</div>

<p>LHNM represents the base of the pyramid. On
the half-base AC I described a 3, 4, 5 triangle ABC. I
then projected the line CF = BC to be the altitude of
the pyramid. Thus I erected the triangle BFC, ratio of
BC to CF being 1 to 1. From this datum I arrived at
the triangles BEA, ADC, and GKH. GK, EA, and
AD, each represent apothem of pyramid; CF, and CD,
altitude; and HK, edge.</p>

<p>The length of the line AD being √(AC² + CD²), the
length of the line HK being √(HG² + GK²), and line CH
(half diagonal of base) being √(CG² + GH²). These
measures reduced to R.B. cubits, calling the line AC =
ratio 4 = 105 cubits, half-base of pyramid, give the following
results:<span class="pagenum">[Pg 106]</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>LHNM represents the base of the pyramid. On

erecting the 20, 21, 29 triangle BCF. From this datum,
I arrived at the triangles BEA, ADC, and GKH;
GK, EA and AD each representing apothem; CF and
CD, altitude; and HK, edge. The lengths of the lines

<p>Cheops is therefore the mean or centre of a system&mdash;the
slopes of Mycerinus being a little flatter, and those
of Cephren a little steeper, Cheops coming fairly between
the two, within about 10 minutes; and thus the
connection between the ground plan of the group and
the slopes of the three pyramids is exactly as one might
expect after examination of Figure 3, 4 or 5.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
