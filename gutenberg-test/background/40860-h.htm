<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The reader is requested to observe, that, though
the plan of this work is entirely his own, the compiler
of it does not put it forth as in any way original
in respect to language or description. It is, in
fact, a much better book, than if it had been what
is strictly called original, (which, indeed, must have
involved an utter impossibility:) for it is a selection
of some of the best materials the British Museum
could furnish; sometimes worked up in his own
language; and sometimes&mdash;and, indeed, very frequently&mdash;in
that of others: the compiler having, at
an humble distance and with unequal steps, followed
the plan which M. Rollin proposed to himself, when
he composed his celebrated history of ancient times.&mdash;"To
adorn and enrich my own," says that celebrated
writer, "I will be so ingenuous as to confess,
that I do not scruple, nor am ashamed, to rifle whereever
I come; and that I often do not cite the authors
from whom I transcribe, because of the liberty I
take to make some slight alterations. I have made the
best use in my power of the solid reflections that occur
in the Bishop of Meaux's Universal History, which
is one of the most beautiful and most useful books in
our language. I have also received great assistance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
from the learned Dean Prideaux's 'Connexion of the
Old and New Testament,' in which he has traced
and cleared up, in an admirable manner, the particulars
relating to ancient history. I shall take the
same liberty with whatever comes in my way, that
may suit my design, and contribute to its perfection.
I am very sensible, that it is not so much for a person's
reputation to make use of other men's labours,
and that it is in a manner renouncing the name and
quality of author. But I am not over-fond of that
title, and shall be extremely well pleased, and think
myself very happy, if I can but deserve the name of
a good compiler; and supply my readers with a
tolerable history, who will not be over-solicitous to
inquire what hand it comes from, provided they are
but pleased with it."</p>

<p>Having followed this example,&mdash;the compiler wishes
he could say with equal effect,&mdash;he will be fully satisfied,
should judicious readers feel inclined to concede,
that he has shown some judgment in selecting his
materials, and some taste in binding "the beads of
the chain," that connects them together. He disclaims,
in fact, (as, in the present instance, he is
bound to do), all the "<i>divine honours</i>" of authorship;
satisfied with those of a selecter, adapter, and
compiler; and happy in the hope that he has here,
by means of the superior writers, whose labours he
has used, furnished his readers with an useful, accurate,
and amusing work.</p>

<p>This city stood on the Asiatic side of the Hellespont,
now called the Dardanelles, opposite to the
city of Sestos, on the European side, the distance
from each other being about two miles. Abydos
was built by the Milesians, and became greatly celebrated
from the circumstance that it was here that
Xerxes built his bridge over the Hellespont;&mdash;also for
the loves of Hero and Leander.</p>

<p>Philip, king of Macedon, laid siege to this city,
and nothing of what is generally practised in the
assaulting and defending of cities was omitted in the
siege. No place, say the historians, was ever defended
with greater obstinacy, which might be said at
length, on the side of the besieged, to have risen to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
fury and brutality. Confiding in its own strength,
they repulsed, with the greatest vigour, the approaches
of the Macedonians. Finding, however, at last, that
the outer wall of their city was sapped, and that the
Macedonians carried their mines under the inner one,
they sent deputies to Philip, offering to surrender the
city on certain conditions, one of which was, that all the
free citizens should retire whithersoever they pleased,
with the clothes they then had on. These conditions
were not approved by Philip, he therefore sent for
answer, that the Abydonians had only to choose,
whether they would surrender at discretion or continue
to defend themselves gallantly as they had
before done.</p>

<p>When the citizens heard this they assembled together,
to consider what they should do in so great an
emergency; and here we have to record, not in our
own language but in that of others, for our pen
would be unequal to the description, circumstances
scarcely to be paralleled in all history! It is thus
given by Rollin:&mdash;</p>

<p>They came to these resolutions; first, that the
slaves should be set at liberty, to animate them to
defend the city with the utmost vigour; secondly,
that all the women should be shut up in the temple of
Diana, and all the children with their nurses in the
Gymnasium; that this being done, they then should
bring into the great square all the gold and silver in
the city, and carry all the rest of the valuable effects
into the quadrireme of the Rhodians and the trireme
of the Cyzicenians. This resolution having passed
unanimously, another assembly was called, in which
they chose fifty of the wisest and most ancient of the
citizens, but who at the same time had vigour enough
left to execute what should have been determined;
and they were made to take an oath, in presence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
all the inhabitants, that the instant they saw the
enemy master of the inner wall they should kill the
women and children, set fire to the galleys laden
with their effects, and throw into the sea all the gold
and silver which they had heaped together. Then,
sending for their priests, they took an oath either to
conquer or die, sword in hand; and after having
sacrificed the victims, they obliged the priests and
priestesses to pronounce before the altar the greatest
curses on those who should break their oath.
This being done, they left off countermining, and
resolved, the instant the wall should fall, to fly to
the breach and fight to the last. Accordingly, the
inward wall tumbling, the besieged, true to the oath
they had taken, fought in the breach with such unparalleled
bravery, that though Philip had perpetually
sustained with fresh soldiers those who had
mounted to the assault, yet, when night separated
the combatants, he was still doubtful with regard to
the success of the siege. Such Abydonians as marched
first to the breach, over the heaps of slain, fought
with fury, and not only made use of their swords
and javelins, but after their arms were broken to
pieces or forced from their hands, they rushed furiously
upon the Macedonians, knocked down some,
broke the long spears of others, and with the pieces
struck their faces and such parts of their bodies as
were uncovered, till they made them entirely despair
of the event. When night had put an end to the
slaughter, the breach was quite covered with the
dead bodies of the Abydonians, and those who had
escaped were so prodigiously fatigued, and had
received so many wounds, that they could scarce
support themselves. Things being brought to this
dreadful extremity, two of the principal citizens,
unable to execute the dreadful resolution that had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
been taken, and which at that time displayed
itself to their imaginations in all its horror, agreed
that, to save their wives and children, they should
send to Philip by day-break all their priests and
priestesses, clothed in pontifical habits, to implore
his mercy and open their gates to him. Accordingly
the next morning the city, as had been
agreed, was surrendered to Philip, during which the
greatest part of the Abydonians, who survived, vented
millions of imprecations against their fellow-citizens,
and especially against the priests and priestesses, for
delivering up to the enemy those whom they themselves
had devoted to death with the most dreadful oaths.
Philip marched into the city and seized, without the
least opposition, all the rich effects which the Abydonians
had heaped together in one place. But now
he was greatly terrified with the spectacle he saw.
Among these ill-fated citizens, whom despair had
made furious and distracted, some were strangling
their wives and children; and others cutting them with
swords to pieces; some were running to murder them;
some were plunging them into wells; whilst others
were precipitating them from the tops of the houses;
in a word, death appeared in a variety of horrors.
Philip, pierced with grief, and seized with horror at
the spectacle, stopped the soldiers who were greedy
of plunder, and published a declaration, importing
that he would allow three days to all, who were
resolved to lay violent hands on themselves. He was
in hopes that during this interval they would change
their resolution, but they had made their choice before.
They thought it would be degenerating from those,
who had lost their lives in fighting for their country,
should they survive them. The individuals of every
family killed one another, and none escaped this
murderous expedition but those whose hands were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
tied, or were otherwise kept from destroying themselves.</p>

<p>Nothing now remains of the ancient town, but a

modern one<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="NO_II_ABYDUS" id="NO_II_ABYDUS"></a>NO. II.&mdash;ABYDUS.</h2>


<p>Abydus, in Egypt, is now called Madfuneh, or the
<i>Buried City</i>. According to Pliny and Strabo it was
a colony of Milesians. It is said once to have nearly
equalled Thebes in grandeur and magnificence; but it
was reduced to a village in the reign of Augustus,
and is now only a heap of uninhabited ruins.</p>

<p>In its neighbourhood, however, the celebrated
tomb of Ismandes is still found; he who built the
temple of Osiris, into which no singers or dancers
were ever allowed to enter. Besides numerous tombs
and sepulchral monuments, that are continually
found here, the remains of two grand edifices, and
other ruins, evince its former extent, and justify
the assertion of Strabo, that Abydus formerly
held the first rank after Thebes itself. One of those
edifices was called the Palace of Memnon; but it
was, in reality, commenced by Osirei, and completed
by his son Remesis II., and from the peculiar nature
of its plan, and the structure of its roof, it is particularly
interesting to the antiquary. This last is
formed of large blocks of stone placed from one architrave
to the other; not, as usual in Egyptian buildings,
on their faces, but on their sides; so that
considerable thickness having been given to the roof,
a vault was afterwards cut in them, without endangering
its stability. The other building is the famous
temple of Osiris, who was reported to have been
buried in Abydus, and who was worshipped there in
his most sacred character. There are many other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
places, says Plutarch, where his corpse is said to have
been deposited; but Abydus and Memphis are mentioned
in particular as having the true body; and for
this reason the rich and powerful of the Egyptians
were desirous of being buried in the former of these
two cities, in order to lie, as it were, in the same grave
with Osiris himself. The fact, that the natives of
other towns also were buried at Abydus, is fully
confirmed by modern discoveries; and inscriptions,
purporting that the deceased were from some distant
part of the country, are frequently found in the
tombs of its extensive cemetery. The temple of
Osiris was completed by Remesis II., who enriched
it with a splendid sanctuary, rendered unusually
conspicuous from the materials used in its construction,
being entirely lined with oriental alabaster.
He also added to the numerous chambers and courts
many elegant and highly-finished sculptures. One
of these lateral apartments contains the famous
tablet of kings, discovered by Mr. Bankes, and
which, in an historical point of view, is one of the
most precious monuments hitherto met with among
the ruins of Egypt. In the cemetery to the northward
are some other stone remains, among which is
one of the time of Remesis the Second, and another
bearing the name of Sabaco.</p>

<p>The reservoir mentioned by Strabo, which was
cased with stone, may be traced on the east side
of the ancient town; and in the mountain, to the
north-west, are some limestone quarries, and an
inclined road leading to a narrow grotto, in an unfinished
state, and without sculpture.</p>

<p>The Arabs, in searching for treasure, have heaped
up piles of earth and rubbish; but there are no inhabitants<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>The sterile country between Trapani and Alcamo
(in Sicily) may render the stranger better prepared
to contemplate one of the finest of ancient monuments&mdash;all
that remains of &AElig;gesta, celebrated for
the temple of the Erycinian Venus. This town,
situated on a height at the base of Mount Eryx,
was deserted and almost in ruins at so early a period
as the time of Strabo.</p>

<p>All travellers, who have examined the temple,
are unanimous in its commendation. "The effect it
produced at a distance," says Mons. Simon, "increased
as I approached. Such is the magic of its proportions,
and the beauty of its forms, that, at whatever side it
may be viewed, it is equally admirable. It has
braved the influence of time&mdash;the edifice stands
entire, columns, entablature, pediment&mdash;all except
the cella and roof, which have disappeared. The
columns, of the Ionic order, are about seven feet in
diameter at the base, tapering towards the top, and
only four diameters in height; but they form, with
the front, a total height of fifty-eight feet. The
dimensions of the interior are about one hundred
and seventy-four feet by seventy-two."</p>

<p>This city was destroyed by Agathocles. At a
subsequent time it was the residence of the tyrant
&AElig;milius Censorinus, who offered rewards to such
artists as were the most ingenious in the invention
of instruments of torture!<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>"We seated ourselves on a fallen column," says
Mr. Williams, "and could not but admire the scene
before us: Attica, Peloponnesus, and the gulf of
&AElig;gina, with their many points of attraction, addressing
both the eye and the mind! While we were
enjoying the splendid view, two shepherds stepped
from the ruins, and passing their crooks from their
right hand to their left, pressed their hearts and
foreheads, and kissed their hands in a manner than
which nothing could be more graceful. Their eyes
bespoke their curiosity to know what brought us
there; and when we looked across the gulf, they
both exclaimed, 'Athen&aelig;! Athen&aelig;!' as if we were
desirous to know the name of the distant spot, that
marked the site of Athens."</p>

<p>Servius Sulpitius mentions &AElig;gina in a very agreeable
manner to Cicero, who was then grieving for
the loss of his daughter Tullia:&mdash;"Once," said he,
"when I was in distress, I received a sensible alleviation
of my sorrow from a circumstance, which, in
the hope of its having the same influence upon you,
I will take this opportunity of relating. I was returning
from Asia; and as I was steering my course,
I began to contemplate the surrounding country.
Behind me was &AElig;gina; Megara in the front; the
Pir&aelig;us occupied my right hand, and Corinth my
left. These cities, once flourishing, were now reduced
to irretrievable ruin. 'Alas!' said I, somewhat indignantly,
'shall man presume to complain of the
shortness and the ills of life, whose being in this
world is necessarily short, when I see so many cities,
at one view, totally destroyed?' This reflection, my
friend, relieved my sorrow."</p>

<p>Mr. Dodwell, when he was in &AElig;gina, lodged at
the house of the principal Greek, who was acquainted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
with the leading particulars of its history; and when
he talked of its former grandeur, and compared it
with its present abject condition, the tears came into
his eyes, and he exclaimed&mdash;"<i>Alas! where is &AElig;gina
now?</i>"</p>

<p>The island of &AElig;gina lies between Attica and
Argolis, eighteen miles distant from the coast of
Athens and fourteen from Epidaurus. It does not
exceed nine miles in its greatest length, nor six miles
in its greatest breadth; its interior is rough and
mountainous, and the valleys, though they are made
to bear corn, cotton, olive, and fruit trees, are stony
and narrow. Notwithstanding this, in ancient days,
through the blessings of commerce, this spot in the
seas of Greece was the residence of a numerous and
most thriving population, who created upon it such
works as are still the admiration of the civilised
world, though they are now in ruins; the place, however,
of those who built them, is scantily occupied
by an impoverished and degraded race of men.</p>

<p>The people of &AElig;gina were the first who coined
money to be subservient to the uses of life, agreeably
to the advice of Phidon, who considered that a
maritime commerce would best be promoted, where
exchange and accommodation became easy and familiar
between the vendor and purchaser.</p>

<p>The place, too, had the advantage of security; an
important point in the earlier ages of Greece, when
piracy was a common and honourable profession. It
lay deep within a gulf; nature had made access to
its shores difficult, by nearly encircling them with
rocks and sand-banks; and its industrious population
added artificial defences. Its port also was commodious,
and well protected against the attacks of
man. Here, therefore, the goods procured, far and
near, by the enterprising inhabitants, could be lodged
without fear of pillage, and the Greeks would resort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
hither as to a general mart, where whatever they
wanted might be purchased. Wealth would thus
flow into the island, and its inhabitants, with their
exquisite feeling for all that was beautiful, would
employ their wealth in cultivating the fine arts, and
in covering their barren rocks with grand and graceful
edifices; and this was shown by the ancient
inhabitants of &AElig;gina having had the honour of
introducing a style in sculpture superior to all that
preceded, though inferior to the ultimate perfection
of the Athenian school.</p>

<p>&AElig;gina was, originally, subject to kings; but it
afterwards adopted the republican form of government.
It was at length reduced by the Athenians,
and continued subject to them, till, at the end of the
Macedonian war, it was declared free by the Romans.
In the reign of Vespasian, however, it underwent the
same fortune as the other states of Greece.</p>

<p><small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 1536, it was subdued by the Turks, after an
obstinate resistance; the capital was plundered and
burned; and, after a great slaughter of the inhabitants,
the rest were carried into slavery&mdash;not an unworthy
fate, had it occurred in ancient times, for a
people, who were possessed of 420,000 slaves!</p>

<p>The site of &AElig;gina, the capital of the island, has
long been forsaken. Instead of the temples, mentioned
by Pausanias, there are thirteen lonely
churches, all very mean, and two Doric columns
supporting their architrave. These stand by the
sea-side toward the low cape; and, it has been supposed,
are a remnant of a temple of Venus, which
was situated by the port principally frequented.
The theatre, which is recorded as greatly worth
seeing, resembled that of the Epidaurians, both in
size and workmanship. It was not far from the
private port; the <i>stadium</i>, which like that at
Priene, was constructed with only one side, being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
joined to it behind, and each structure mutually sustaining
and propping the other.</p>

<p>The most celebrated of its edifices was the temple
of Jupiter Panhellenius. "This temple," says Colonel
Leake, "was erected upon a large paved platform,
and must, when complete, have been one of the most
remarkable examples in Greece of the majesty and
beauty of its sacred edifices, as well as of the admirable
taste with which the Greeks enhanced those
qualities by an attention to local situation and surrounding
scenery. It is not only in itself one of the
finest specimens of Grecian architecture, but is the
more curious as being, in all probability, the most
ancient example of the Doric order in Greece, with the
exception of the columns at Corinth." This temple
is far from any habitation, and is surrounded with
shrubs and small pine-trees. No ruin in Greece is more
rich in the picturesque, as every point of view has some
peculiar charm:&mdash;"When I was at &AElig;gina," says
Mr. Dodwell, "the interior of the temple was
covered with large blocks of stone, and overgrown
with bushes. This circumstance produced a sort of
confusion, which, while it intermingled the trees and
the architecture, made a great addition to the picturesque
effect of the interesting scene. The place
has since been cleared, the stones have been taken
away, and the trees cut down to facilitate the
removal of the statues which were found among the
ruins. Though these changes may have made some
deduction from the pleasure with which the painter
would have viewed the spot, yet they have added
greatly to the gratification of the classical traveller,
by whom all the architectural details may now be
readily examined and accurately discriminated."</p>

<p>This ruin Dr. Chandler considers as scarcely to be
paralleled in its claim to remote antiquity. The situa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>tion
on a lonely mountain at a distance from the sea
has preserved it from total demolition, and all the
changes and accidents of numerous centuries<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>Lusieri classes the architecture of the temple
of the Panhellenian Jupiter at &AElig;gina with that of
P&aelig;stum in Lucania:&mdash;"In their buildings," says he,
"the Doric order attained a pre-eminence which it
never passed; not a stone has been there placed
without some evident and important design; every
part of the structure bespeaks its own essential utility.
Of such a nature were works in architecture,
when the whole aim of the architect was to unite
grandeur with utility; the former being founded on the
latter. All then was truth, strength, and sublimity."</p>

<p>In 1811, several statues of Parian marble were
discovered by two English gentlemen and two Germans<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>,
the rivals in the style of which are said nowhere
to be found. They were excavated from the
two extremities of the temple below the tympana,
from which they had fallen at some unknown period.
Mr. Dodwell has given the following account of
them:&mdash;"I shall not attempt," says he, "a minute
description of these precious remains of the &AElig;ginetic
school; the discovery of which, in its importance,
has not been surpassed by any of the kind in modern
times. They are supposed by some to represent the
principal heroes of the Iliad contending with the
Trojans for the body of Patroclus. Minerva, armed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
with her helmet, is the principal figure; and from its
superior size, is conjectured to have stood in the
centre of the tympanum, below which it was found.
The other figures are combatants in various costumes
and attitudes; their shields are circular, and their
helmets crowned with the lophos. The bodies of
some are naked, while others are covered with
armour or leather; their attitudes are judiciously
adapted to the four tympana, and the places which
they occupied. They were evidently made prior to the
introduction of the beautiful ideal in Grecian sculpture.
The muscles and the veins, which are anatomically
correct, exhibit the soft flexibility of life, and
every motion of the body is in scientific harmony
with that of nature. The limbs are strong, though
not Herculean, and elegant without effeminacy;
no preposterous muscular protuberance, no unnatural
feminine delicacy offends the eye. They are noble
without being harsh or rigid, and are composed
with Doric severity mingled with the airy grace of
youthful forms; the perfection of the finish is quite
wonderful; every part being in a style worthy of the
most beautiful cameo. The extremities of the hands
and feet merit more particular admiration. Indeed,
the ancients thought that elegant fingers and nails
were essential ingredients in the composition of the
beautiful. The most extraordinary circumstance,
however, in these statues, is the want of expression,
and the sameness of countenance, which is to be
observed in all the heads. This approximation to
identity is certainly not fortuitous; for the artists,
who were able to throw so much varied beauty
into the forms of the bodies, were, no doubt, fully
able to infuse a similar diversity of expression into
the features. Their talent was probably confined
to one style of countenance by some religious pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>judice.
Perhaps some ancient and much venerated
statue served as a model, from which it might
not have been consistent with the feeling of reverence,
or with the state of opinion, to deviate. The
formation and posture of the bodies afforded a greater
scope and a wider field for the talent of the sculptor;
for while the Doric severity of the early &AElig;ginetic
school is evidently diffused through the whole, yet a
correctness of muscular knowledge; and a strict adherence
to natural beauty, are conspicuously blended
in every statue. An unmeaning and inanimate smile is
prevalent in all the faces; every one of the heroes,
who is mortally wounded, is supporting himself in
the most beautiful attitude, and smiling upon death!
In short, the conquerors and the conquered, the dying
and dead, have all one expression, or rather none at
all. The high finish of the hair is particularly worthy
of notice. Some in curls, which hang down in short
ringlets, are of lead, and still remain. The helmets
were ornamented with metallic accessories, and the
offensive weapons were probably of bronze; but they
have not been found. All the figures have been
painted; the colour is still visible, though nearly
effaced. The colour on the &aelig;gis of Minerva is very
distinguishable; but the white marble, of which the
statues are composed, has assumed a yellow dye
from the soil in which they were buried."</p>

<p>Dr. Clarke tells us, that Lusieri found here
both medals and vases in such numbers, that he
was under the necessity of dismissing the peasants
who amassed them, without purchasing more than
half that were brought to him; although they were
offered for a very trifling consideration, and were of
very high antiquity<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="NO_V_AGRIGENTUM" id="NO_V_AGRIGENTUM"></a>NO. V.&mdash;AGRIGENTUM.</h2>


<p>The citadel of Agrigentum (Sicily) was situated
on Mount Agragas; the city in the vale below; forming
a magnificent spectacle at a distance. It was
founded by a native of Rhodes, according to Polybius;
but by a colony from Ionia, according to Strabo;
about one hundred and eighty years after the founding
of Syracuse. Thucydides, however, says that it was
founded by a colony from Gela. The government
was at first monarchical; afterwards democratical.</p>

<p>Phalaris, so well known for his superior talent and
tyranny, usurped the sovereignty, which for some
time afterwards was under the sway of the Carthaginians.
In its most flourishing condition, it is said
to have contained not less than two hundred thousand
persons, who submitted, without resistance, to the
superior authority of the Syracusans.</p>

<p>Some idea of the wealth of this city may be imagined,
from what is stated by Diodorus Siculus, of
one of its citizens. At the time when Exenetes,
who had been declared victor in the Olympic games<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>,
entered the city in triumph, he did so in a magnificent
chariot, attended by three hundred more, all drawn
by white horses. Their habits were adorned with
gold and silver; and nothing was ever more splendid
than their appearance. Gellias, the most wealthy
citizen of the place, erected several apartments in his
house for the reception and entertainment of guests.
Servants waited by his order at the gates of the city,
to invite all strangers to lodge at their master's house,
whither they conducted them. A violent storm
having obliged one hundred horsemen to take shelter
there, Gellias entertained them all in his house, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
supplied them immediately with dry clothes, of which
he had always a great quantity in his wardrobe.</p>

<p>Though this gives us some notion of his wealth,
there is another description still more indicative of
his humanity. He entertained the people with spectacles
and feasts; and, during a famine, prevented the
citizens from dying with hunger; he gave portions to
poor maidens also, and rescued the unfortunate from
want and despair. He had houses built in the city
and the country, purposely for the accommodation of
strangers, whom he usually dismissed with handsome
presents. Five hundred shipwrecked citizens of Gela,
applying to him, were bountifully relieved; and
every man supplied with a cloak and a coat out of
his wardrobe.</p>

<p>Agrigentum was first taken by the Carthaginians.
It was strongly fortified. It was situated, as
were Hymera and Selinuntum, on that coast of Sicily
which faces Africa. Accordingly, Hannibal, imagining
that it was impregnable except on one side, turned
his whole force that way. He threw up banks and
terraces as high as the walls; and made use, on this
occasion, of the rubbish and fragments of the tombs
standing round the city, which he had demolished
for that purpose. Soon after, the plague infected the
army, and swept away a great number of the soldiers.
The Carthaginians interpreted this disaster as a
punishment inflicted by the gods, who revenged in
this manner the injuries done to the dead, whose
ghosts many fancied they had seen stalking before
them in the night. No more tombs were therefore
demolished; prayers were ordered to be made according
to the practice of Carthage; a child was sacrificed
to Saturn, in compliance with a most inhumanly
superstitious custom; and many victims were
thrown into the sea in honour of Neptune.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>The besieged, who at first had gained several advantages,
were at last so pressed by famine, that all
hopes of relief seeming desperate, they resolved to
abandon the city. The following night was fixed on
for this purpose. The reader will naturally imagine
to himself the grief with which these miserable people
must be seized, on their being forced to leave their
houses, rich possessions, and their country; but life
was still dearer to them than all these. Never was
a more melancholy spectacle seen. To omit the rest,
a crowd of women, bathed in tears, were seen dragging
after them their helpless infants, in order to
secure them from the brutal fury of the victor. But
the most grievous circumstance was the necessity
they were under of leaving behind them the aged and
sick, who were unable either to fly or to make the
least resistance. The unhappy exiles arrived at Gela,
which was the nearest city in their way, and there
received all the comforts they could expect in the
deplorable condition to which they were reduced.</p>

<p>In the meantime Imilcon entered the city, and
murdered all who were found in it. The plunder was
immensely rich, and such as might be expected from
one of the most opulent cities of Sicily, which contained
two hundred thousand inhabitants, and had
never been besieged, nor, consequently, plundered
before. A numberless multitude of pictures, vases,
and statues of all kinds, were found here, the citizens
having an exquisite taste for the polite arts. Among
other curiosities, was the famous bull of Phalaris,
which was sent to Carthage.</p>

<p>At a subsequent period the Romans attacked this
city, then in possession of the Carthaginians; took it,
and the chief persons of Agrigentum were, by the
consul's order, first scourged with rods, and then beheaded.
The common people were made slaves, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
sold to the best bidder. After this, Agrigentum is
seldom mentioned in history; nor is it easy to ascertain
the precise time in which the old city was destroyed,
and the new one (<i>Gergenti</i>) was built. It
was crushed in the general fall of the Greek state,
and its unfortunate inhabitants, expelled by the Saracens,
took refuge among the black and inaccessible
rocks of Girgenti.</p>

<p>In ancient times, this city was greatly celebrated
for the hospitality and luxurious mode of living,
adopted by its inhabitants. On one side of the city
there was a large artificial lake, about a quarter of a
league in circumference, dug out of the solid rock by
the Carthaginian captives, and to which the water
was conveyed from the hills. It was thirty feet deep;
great quantities of fish were kept in this reservoir for
the public feasts; and swans and other fowls were
kept upon it for the amusement of the citizens; and
the depth of its waters secured the city from the
sudden assault of an enemy. It is now dry, and
converted into a garden.</p>

<p>It is, nevertheless, a curious fact, that though the
whole space within the walls of the ancient city
abounds with traces of antiquity, there are no ruins
which can be supposed to have belonged to places of
public entertainment. Yet the Agrigentines were
remarkably fond of shows and dramatic amusements;
and their connexion with the Romans must have
introduced among them the savage games of the
circus. Theatres and amphitheatres seem peculiarly
calculated to resist the outrages of time; yet not a
vestige of these are to be seen on the site of Agrigentum.
They appear, however, to have been quite
alive to the pleasures to be derived from sculpture and
painting.</p>

<p>The Temple of Juno was adorned by one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
most famous pictures of antiquity; which is celebrated
by many of the ancient writers. Zeuxis was
determined to excel any thing that had gone before
him, and to form a model of human perfection. To
this end, he prevailed on all the finest women of
Agrigentum, who were ambitious of the honour,
to appear naked before him. Of these he chose five
for his models; and moulding all the perfections of
these beauties into one, he composed the picture of
the goddess. This was ever looked upon as his
masterpiece; but was, unfortunately, burnt when the
Carthaginians took Agrigentum. At that period,
many of the citizens retired into this temple, as to a
place of safety; but as soon as they found the gates
attacked by the enemy, they agreed to set fire to it,
and chose rather to perish in the flames, than submit
to the power of the conqueror. In the Temple of
Hercules, there was another picture by Zeuxis.
Hercules was represented, in his cradle, killing the
two serpents; Alcmena and Amphitrion, having just
entered the apartment, were painted with every mark
of terror and astonishment. Pliny says, the painter
looked upon this piece as invaluable; and, therefore,
could never be prevailed upon to put a price upon it;
but gave it as a present to the people of Agrigentum,
to be placed in the temple of Hercules.</p>

<p>The temples, also, were very magnificent. That
of &AElig;sculapius, two columns and two pilasters
of which now support the end of a farm-house,
was not less celebrated for a statue of Apollo. It
was taken from them by the Carthaginians, at the
same time that the Temple of Juno was burnt. It
was carried off by the conquerors, and continued the
greatest ornament of Carthage for many years; but
was, at last, restored by Scipio, at the final destruction
of the city. Some of the Sicilians allege, but it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
is supposed without ground, that this statue was
afterward carried to Rome, and still remains there,
the wonder of all ages; and known to the whole
world, under the name of the Apollo Belvidere.</p>

<p>An edifice of the Doric order, called the Temple of
Concord, has still its walls, its columns, entablature,
and pediments, entire. In proceeding from the Temple
of Concord, you walk between rows of sepulchres,
cut in the rock, wherever it admitted of being excavated
by the hand of man, or was so already by that
of nature. Some masses are hewn into the shape of
coffins; others drilled full of small square holes,
employed in a different mode of interment, and serving
as receptacles of urns. One ponderous piece of the
rock lies in an extraordinary position. By the failure
of its foundation, or the shock of an earthquake, it
has been loosened from the general quarry, and rolled
down the declivity, where it now remains supine,
with the cavities turned upwards. There was also a
temple dedicated to Ceres and Proserpine; with the
ruins was formed a church, which now exists; and
the road, leading to which, was cut out of the solid
rock. In respect to the temple of Castor and Pollux,
vegetation has covered the lower parts of the building,
and only a few fragments of two columns appear
between the vines. Of the Temple of Venus, about
one half remains; but the glory of the place was the
Temple of Jupiter Olympius, three hundred and forty
feet long, sixty broad, and one hundred and twenty
in height. Its columns and porticos were in the
finest style of architecture; and its bas-reliefs and
paintings executed with admirable taste. On its
eastern walls was sculptured the Battle of the Giants;
while the western represented the Trojan War; corresponding
exactly with the description which Virgil
had given of the painting in the Temple of Juno at
Carthage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Diodorus Siculus extols the beauty of the columns
which supported the building; the admirable structure
of the porticos, and the exquisite taste with
which the bas-reliefs and paintings were executed;
but he adds, that the stately edifice was never finished.
Cicero, against Verres, speaks of the statues he carried
away. Mr. Swinburne says, that it has remaining
not one stone upon another; and that it is barely
possible, with the liberal aid of conjecture, to discover
the traces of its plan and dimensions. He adds, however,
that St. Peter's at Rome exceeds this celebrated
temple more than doubly in every dimension; being
two hundred and fifteen feet higher, three hundred
and thirty-four longer, and four hundred and thirty-three
wider.</p>

<p>Added to these, there is now remaining a monument
of Tero, king of Agrigentum, one of the first of
the Sicilian tyrants. The great antiquity of this
monument may be gathered from this; that Tero is
not only mentioned by Diodorus, Polybius, and the
more modern of the ancient historians, but likewise
by Herodotus, and Pindar, who dedicates two of his
Olympic Odes to him; so that this monument must
be much more than two thousand years old. It is a
kind of pyramid, the most durable of forms; and is
surrounded by aged olive-trees, which cast a wild,
irregular shade over the ruin.</p>

<p>All these mighty ruins of Agrigentum, and the
whole mountain on which it stands, says Mr. Brydone,
is composed of an immense concretion of seashells,
run together, and cemented by a kind of sand,
or gravel, and now become as hard, and perhaps more
durable, than even marble itself. This stone is white
before it has been exposed to the air; but in the
temples and other ruins it is become "set," of a very
dark brown. These shells are found on the very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
summit of the mountain, which is at least fourteen or
fifteen hundred feet above the level of the sea.</p>

<p>The celebrated Empedocles was a native of this
city; one of the finest spirits that ever adorned the
earth. His saying, in regard to his fellow-citizens,
is well known;&mdash;viz., that they squandered their
money so excessively every day, that they seemed to
expect it could never be exhausted; and that they
built with such solidity and magnificence, as if they
thought they should live for ever<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p>It has been stated, or rather speculated upon, that
the entire history of this place is no other than a
romance. By Dionysius of Halicarnassus, however,
it is said to have existed four hundred and eighty-seven
years; when, after having been the founder of
thirty other Latin cities, it was destroyed by the
Roman power.</p>

<p>That it existed, is also attested by the ruins that
now remain. Its ancient characteristics are thus
described by Dionysius:&mdash;it was so built, with
regard to its mountain and lake, that it occupied a
space between them, each serving like a wall of
defence to the city.</p>

<p>It was long supposed to have been situated where
Palazzuolo now is. Sir W. Gell says, "On passing
up the new road, running from the dry bed of the
river Albanus, where it crosses the Appian Way,
near Bolerill&aelig;, and leading to the Villa Torlonia, or
Castel Gandolfo, a few ancient tombs were observed
about half way up the ascent; and further examination
showed, that these tombs had once bordered an
ancient road, now almost obliterated. It was obvious,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
that such a road must have led from some place on
the plain, to another on the mountain. Toward the
sea, the high tower of Pratica (Lavinium) lay in the
direct line of the road; and it seemed certain that the
city on the mountain, to which it led, could have
been no other than Alba Longa. Climbing upward
among the bushes, ponderous blocks of stone were
discovered, evidently the remains of the walls of this
city. By a farther search, more were found. At a
distance a small cavern was discovered; and not only
the remains of a well, but part of a column of stone,
two feet four inches in diameter. At a higher point
the shore was covered with ruins, consisting of large
blocks of rectangular stones, nearly buried in the soil,
and scarcely discernible among the bushes."</p>

<p>There is a tradition, that the palaces of the kings
of Alba stood on a rock; and so near to the edge of
the precipice, that when the impiety of one of its
monarchs provoked Jupiter to strike it with his
lightning, a part of the mass was precipitated into
the lake, carrying the impious king along with the
ruins of his habitation. This tradition is apparently
confirmed by a singular feature in a part of the remains
of this city; for, directly under the rock of the
citadel, toward the lake, and where the palace, both
for security and prospect, would have been placed,
is a cavern, fifty feet in depth, and more than one
hundred in width; a part of the roof of which has
evidently fallen in, and some of the blocks still remain
on the spot<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.</p>

<p>This town (in Spain) was built by the Moors,
who gave it the name it bears; which, in the Moorish
language, signifies a bridge; and this bridge shows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
that the original city belonged to the Romans in the
time of Trajan; for on one of the arches is this
inscription:&mdash;</p>

NERVAE. TRAIANO. AVG.<br />
GERM. DACICO.<br />
PONT. MAX. TRIB. POTEST. VIII.<br />

</small></p>

<p>Formerly there were four pieces of marble, fixed
in the walls of the bridge; in each of which there was
an inscription, containing the names of the several
towns and districts, that contributed towards the
expense of making it. Three of these marbles are
lost; but the fourth remains, and bears the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>At the entrance of the bridge there is a small
temple, cut in the rock, by the same person that built
the bridge. The roof of this temple consists of two
large stones. In the temple there is an inscription to
the following effect:&mdash;"<i>It is reasonable to imagine,
that every one, that passes this way, would be glad to
know the name of the person that built this bridge and
temple; and with what intent they were made, by</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
<i>cutting into this rock of the Tagus, full of the majesty
of the Gods, and of C&aelig;sar, and where art showed
itself superior to the tough and stubborn matter that
resisted her. Know, then, that it was that noble
architect Lacer, who built this bridge, which will last
as long as the world. Lacer, having finished this
noble bridge, made and dedicated this new temple,
with sacrifices, to the gods, in hopes of rendering them
propitious to him, for having honoured them after
this manner. This temple he dedicated to the gods of
Rome, and to C&aelig;sar; looking upon himself to have
been extremely fortunate, in having been able to make
so just and proper a sacrifice.</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>"</p>

<p>Of the several capitals of Egypt in successive
ages<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, Thebes, or Diospolis, was the most ancient.
Next was Memphis; itself a city of the most remote
antiquity. Babylon seems to have been only the
capital of a part, retained by the Persians, after
Cambyses had subdued Egypt; and was, by all
accounts, founded by the Persians. Alexandria succeeded
Memphis, and remained the chief city, till
the Saracens founded Misr-el-Kahira.</p>

<p>Alexander, in his way to the temple of Jupiter
Ammon, observed, opposite to the island of Pharos,
a spot which he thought extremely well adapted for
the building of a city. He, therefore, set about
drawing the plan of one; in doing which he particularly
marked out the several places where temples
and squares should be erected. The general execution
he committed to the architect who had rebuilt
the temple of Diana at Ephesus (Dinocrates). This
city he called Alexandria, after his own name; and
being situated with the Mediterranean on one side,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and one of the branches of the Nile on the other, it
soon drew all the commerce, both of the east and
west. It still remains, and is situate about four days'
journey from Cairo. The merchandises were unloaded
at Portus Muris<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, a town on the western
coast of the Red Sea; whence they were brought upon
camels to a town of Thebais, called Copt, and conveyed
down the Nile to Alexandria, whither merchants
from all parts resorted.</p>

<p>The trade of the East has at all times enriched
those who carried it on. Solomon received from one
commercial voyage, no less a sum than three millions
two hundred and forty thousand pounds<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. Tyre
afterwards had the trade. When the Ptolemies,
however, had built Berenice, and other ports on the
western side of the Red Sea, and fixed their chief
mart at Alexandria, that city became the most
flourishing of all the cities in the world. "There,"
says Prideaux, "it continued for many centuries
after; and all the traffic which the western parts of
the world from that time had with Persia, India,
Arabia, and the eastern coasts of Arabia, was wholly
carried on through the Red Sea, and the mouth of
the Nile, till a way was discovered of sailing to those
parts by the Cape of Good Hope."</p>

<p>Alexander was buried<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> in the city he had built;
and as the sarcophagus in which he was placed has
now become an object of great curiosity, by having
been taken from the French, at Alexandria, where it
was found in the mosque of St. Athanasius, and
placed in the British Museum, we shall give (from
Rollin) an account of his funeral; for never had any
monarch one so magnificent!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p><p>Alexander died at Babylon. Arid&aelig;us, having
been deputed by all the governors and grandees of the
kingdom, to take upon himself the care of his obsequies,
had employed two years in preparing every
thing that could render it the most august funeral that
had ever been seen. When all things were ready
for the celebration of this mournful ceremonial, orders
were given for the procession to begin. This was
preceded by a great number of pioneers and other
workmen, whose office was to make all the ways
practicable, through which the procession was to
pass. As soon as these were levelled, the magnificent
chariot, the invention and design of which raised as
much admiration as the immense riches that glittered
all over it, set out from Babylon. The body of the
chariot rested upon two alxetrees, that were inserted
into four wheels, made after the Persian manner;
the naves and spokes of which were covered with
gold, and the rounds plated over with iron. The
extremities of the axletrees were made of gold, representing
the mouths of lions biting a dart. The
chariot had four draught-poles, to each of which were
harnessed four sets of mules, each set consisting of
four of those animals; so that this chariot was drawn
by sixty-four mules. The strongest of those creatures,
and the largest, were chosen on this occasion.
They were adorned with crowns of gold, and collars
enriched with precious stones and golden bells. On
this chariot was erected a pavilion of entire gold,
twelve feet wide, and eighteen in length, supported
by columns of the Ionic order, embellished with the
leaves of acanthus. The inside was adorned with a
blaze of jewels, disposed in the form of shells. The
circumference was beautified with a fringe of golden
net-work; the threads that composed the texture
were an inch in thickness, and to those were fastened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
large bells, whose sound was heard to a great distance.
The external decorations were disposed into four
relievos. The first represented Alexander seated in
a military chariot, with a splendid sceptre in his
hand, and surrounded, on one side, with a troop of
Macedonians in arms; and on the other, with an
equal number of Persians, armed in their manner.
These were preceded by the king's equerries. In the
second were seen elephants completely harnessed,
with a band of Indians seated on the fore part of
their bodies; and on the hinder, another band of
Macedonians, armed as in the day of battle. The
third exhibited to the view several squadrons of
horse ranged in military array. The fourth represented
ships preparing for a battle. At the entrance
into the pavilion were golden lions, that seemed to
guard the passage. The four corners were adorned
with statues of gold, representing victories, with
trophies of arms in their hands. Under the pavilion
was placed a throne of gold of a square form, adorned
with the heads of animals, whose necks were encompassed
with golden circles a foot and a half in
breadth; to these were hung crowns that glittered
with the liveliest colours, and such as were carried
in procession at the celebration of sacred solemnities.
At the foot of the throne was placed the coffin of
Alexander, formed of beaten gold, and half filled with
aromatic spices and perfumes, as well to exhale an
agreeable odour, as for the preservation of the corpse.
A pall of purple, wrought with gold, covered the
coffin. Between this and the throne the arms of that
monarch were disposed in the manner he wore them
while living. The outside of the pavilion was likewise
covered with purple, flowered with gold. The
top ended in a very large crown of the same metal,
which seemed to be a composition of olive-branches.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
The rays of the sun which darted on this diadem, in
conjunction with the motion of the chariot, caused
it to emit a kind of rays like those of lightning.
It may easily be imagined, that, in so long a procession,
the motion of a chariot, loaded like this,
would be liable to great inconveniences. In order,
therefore, that the pavilion, with all its appendages,
might, when the chariot moved in any uneven ways,
constantly continue in the same situation, notwithstanding
the inequality of the ground, and the shocks
that would frequently be unavoidable, a cylinder was
raised from the middle of each axle-tree, to support
the pavilion; by which expedient the whole machine
was preserved steady. The chariot was followed by
the royal guards, all in arms, and magnificently
arrayed. The multitude of spectators of this solemnity
is hardly credible; but they were drawn together
as well by their veneration for the memory of Alexander,
as by the magnificence of this funeral pomp,
which had never been equalled in the world. There
was a current prediction, that the place where
Alexander should be interred, would be rendered
the most happy and flourishing part of the whole
earth. The governors contested with each other,
for the disposal of a body that was to be attended
with such a glorious prerogative. The affection,
Perdiccas entertained for his country, made him
desirous that the corpse should be conveyed to &AElig;ge,
in Macedonia, where the remains of its kings were
usually deposited. Other places were likewise proposed,
but the preference was given to Egypt.
Ptolemy, who had such extraordinary and recent
obligations to the king of Macedonia, was determined
to signalise his gratitude on this occasion. He
accordingly set out with a numerous guard of his
best troops, in order to meet the procession, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
advanced as far as Syria. When he had joined the
attendants on the funeral, he prevented them from
interring the corpse in the temple of Jupiter Ammon,
as they had proposed. It was therefore deposited,
first, in the city of Memphis, and from thence was
conveyed to Alexandria. Ptolemy raised a magnificent
temple to the memory of this monarch, and rendered
him all the honours which were usually paid
to demi-gods and heroes by Pagan antiquity.</p>

<p>Freinshemius, in his supplement to Livy, relates,
after Leo the African<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, that the tomb of Alexander
the Great was still to be seen in his time, and that
it was reverenced by the Mohammedans, as the
monument, not only of an illustrious king, but of a
great prophet.
<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
The ancient city, together with its suburbs, was
about seven leagues in length; and Diodorus informs
us that the number of its inhabitants amounted to above
300,000, consisting only of the citizens and freemen;
but that, reckoning the slaves and foreigners,
they were allowed, at a moderate computation, to
be upwards of a million. These vast numbers of
people were enticed to settle here by the convenient
situation of the place for commerce; since, besides
the advantage of a communication to the eastern
countries by the canal cut out of the Nile into the
Red Sea, it had two very spacious and commodious
ports, capable of containing the shipping of all the
then trading nations in the world.</p>

<p>The harbour, called Portus Eunostus, lay in the
centre of the city; thus rendering the ships secure,
not only by nature but by art. The figure of this
harbour was a circle, the entrance being nearly
closed up by two artificial moles, which left a pas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>sage
for two ships only to pass abreast. At the
western extremity of one of these moles stood the
celebrated tower called Pharos. The ruins of it are
buried in the sea, at the bottom of which, in a calm
day, one may easily distinguish large columns and
several vast pieces of marble, which give sufficient
proofs of the magnificence of the building in which
they were anciently employed.</p>

<p>This light-house was erected by Ptolemy Philadelphus.
Its architect was Sostratus of Cnidos; its
cost was 180,000<i>l.</i> sterling, and it was reckoned one
of the seven wonders of the world<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. It was a large
square structure built of white marble, on the top of
which a fire was constantly kept burning, in order
to guide ships by night. Pharos was originally an
island at the distance nearly of a mile from the
continent, but was afterwards joined to it by a
causeway like that of Tyre.</p>

<p>This Pharos was destroyed, and, in its stead, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
square castle was built without taste or ornament,
and incapable of sustaining the fire of a single vessel
of the line: at present, in a space of two leagues,
walled round, nothing is to be seen but marble
columns lying in the dust, and sawed in pieces; for
the Turks make mill-stones of them; together with
the remains of pilasters, capitals, obelisks, and mountains
of ruins heaped on each other.</p>

<p>Alexandria had one peculiar advantage over all
others:&mdash;Dinocrates, considering the great scarcity
of good water in this country, dug very spacious
vaults, which, having communication with all parts
of the city, furnished its inhabitants with one of the
chief necessaries of life. These vaults were divided
into capacious reservoirs, or cisterns, which were
filled, at the time of the inundation of the Nile, by a
canal cut out of the Canopic branch, entirely for that
purpose. The water was, in that manner, preserved
for the remainder of the year; and being refined by
the long settlement, was not only the clearest, but
the wholesomest of any in Egypt. This grand work
is still remaining; whence the present city, though
built out of the ruins of the ancient one, still enjoys
the benefactions of Alexander, its founder.</p>

<p>A street<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>, two thousand feet wide, began at the
Marine gate, and ended at the gate of Canopus,
adorned with magnificent houses, temples, and public
edifices. Through this extent of prospect the eye
was never satiated with admiring the marble, the
porphyry, and the obelisks which were destined
hereafter to adorn Rome and Constantinople. This
street was indeed the finest the world ever saw.</p>

<p>Besides all the private buildings constructed with
porphyry and marble, there was an admirable temple
to Serapis, and another to Neptune; also a theatre,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
an amphitheatre, gymnasium, and circus. The materials
had all the perfection which the experience of
one thousand years could afford; and the wealth
and exertions, not only of Egypt but of Asia. The
place was extensive and magnificent; and a succession
of wise and good princes rendered it, by means
of Egyptian materials and Grecian taste, one of
the richest and most perfect cities the world has ever
beheld.</p>

<p>The palace occupied one quarter of the city; but
within its precincts were a museum, extensive groves,
and a temple containing the sepulchre of Alexander.</p>

<p>This city was also famous for a temple erected to
the God Serapis, in which was a statue which the
natives of Sinope (in Pontus) had bartered, in a
season of famine, for a supply of corn. The temple
was called the Serapion; and Ammianus Marcellinus
assures us<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>, that it surpassed all the temples
then in the world for beauty and magnificence, with
the sole exception of the Capitol at Rome.</p>

<p>Ptolemy Soter made this city the metropolitan
seat of arts and sciences. He founded the museum,
the most ancient and most sumptuous temple ever
erected by any monarch, in honour of learning; he
filled it with men of abilities, and made it an asylum
for philosophers of all descriptions, whose doctrines
were misunderstood, and whose persons were persecuted;
in whose unfeigned tribute of grateful praise
he has found a surer road to everlasting renown,
than his haughty nameless predecessors, who pretended
to immortality, and braved both heaven and
corroding time by the solid structure of their pyramids.</p>

<p>He founded also a library, which was considerably
augmented by Ptolemy Philadelphus, and by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the magnificence of his successors, was at length increased
to 700,000 volumes.</p>

<p>In C&aelig;sar's time, part of this library,&mdash;that portion
which was situated in the quarter of the city called
the Bruchion,&mdash;was consumed by fire; a conflagration
which caused the loss of not fewer than 400,000
volumes.</p>

<p>This library, a short time after, received the increase
of 200,000 volumes from Pergamus; Antony
having given that library to Cleopatra. It was
afterwards ransacked several times; but it was still
a numerous and very celebrated library at the time
in which it was destroyed by the Saracens, viz. <small>A.&nbsp;D.</small>
642; a history of which we shall soon have to relate.</p>

<p>The manner in which this library was originally
collected, may be judged of, in no small degree, by
the following relation:&mdash;All the Greek and other
books that were brought into Egypt were seized and
sent to the Museum, where they were transcribed by
persons employed for that purpose; the copies were
then delivered to the proprietors, and the originals
were deposited in the library. Ptolemy Evergetes, for
instance, borrowed the works of Sophocles, Euripides,
and &AElig;schylus, of the Athenians, and only returned
them the copies, which he had caused to be transcribed
in as beautiful a manner as possible; and he likewise
presented them with fifteen talents, equal to fifteen
thousand crowns, for the originals, which he kept.</p>

<p>On the death of Cleopatra, Egypt was reduced
into a province of the Roman empire, and governed
by a prefect sent from Rome. Alexander founded the
city in 3629; and the reign of the Ptolemies, who
succeeded him, lasted to the year of the world 3974.</p>

<p>The city, in the time of Augustus, must have been
very beautiful; for when that personage entered it,
he told the natives, who had acted against him, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
he pardoned them all; first, out of respect to the
name of their founder; and, secondly, on account of
the beauty of their city. This beauty and opulence,
however, were not without their corresponding evils;
for Quintilian informs us, that as Alexandria improved
in commerce and in opulence, her inhabitants
grew so effeminate and voluptuous, that the word
Alexandrine became proverbial, to express softness,
indelicacy, and immodest language.</p>

<p>Egypt having become a province of Rome, some
of the emperors endeavoured to revive in it a love of
letters, and enriched it by various improvements.
The emperor Caligula was inclined to favour the
Alexandrians, because they manifested a readiness
to confer divine honours upon him. He even conceived
the horrid design of massacring the chief
senators and knights of Rome (<small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 40), and then of
abandoning the city, and of settling at Alexandria; the
prosperity and wealth of which in the time of Aurelian
was so great, that, after the defeat of Zenobia, a
single merchant of this city undertook to raise and
pay an army out of the profits of his trade!</p>

<p>The rapid rise of the power of the Moslems, and
the religious discord which prevailed in Egypt, levelled
a death-blow at the grandeur of this powerful city,
whose prosperity had been unchecked from the time
of its foundation;&mdash;upwards of nine hundred and
seventy years. Amrou, the lieutenant of Omar, king
of the Saracens, having entered Egypt, and taken
Pelusium, Babylon, and Memphis, laid siege to
Alexandria, and after fourteen months carried the
city by assault, and all Egypt submitted to the yoke
of the Caliphs. The standard of Mahomet was planted
on the walls of Alexandria <small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 640. Abulfaragius,
in his history of the tenth dynasty, gives the following
account of this catastrophe:&mdash;John Philoponus, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
famous Peripatetic philosopher, being at Alexandria
when the city was taken by the Saracens, was admitted
to familiar intercourse with Amrou, the Arabian
general, and presumed to solicit a gift, inestimable in
his opinion but contemptible in that of the barbarians,
and this was the royal library. Amrou was inclined
to gratify his wish, but his rigid integrity scrupled
to alienate the least object without the Caliph's consent.
He accordingly wrote to Omar, whose well-known
answer was dictated by the ignorance of a
fanatic.</p>

<p>Amrou wrote thus to his master, "I have taken
the great city of the West. It is impossible for me to
enumerate the variety of its riches and beauty; I
shall content myself with observing, that it contains
4000 palaces, 4000 baths, 400 theatres or places of
amusement, 12,000 shops for the sale of vegetable food,
and 40,000 tributary Jews." He then related what
Philoponus had requested of him. "If these writings
of the Greeks," answered the bigoted barbarian, his
master, "agree with the Koran, or book of God,
they are useless, and need not be preserved; if they
disagree they are pernicious, and ought to be destroyed."
This valuable repository, therefore, was
devoted to the flames, and during six months the
volumes of which it consisted supplied fuel to the
four thousand baths, which gave health and cleanliness
to the city. "No complaint," says a celebrated
moralist (Johnson), "is more frequently repeated
among the learned, than that of the waste made by
time among the labours of antiquity. Of those who
once filled the civilised world with their renown
nothing is now left but their names, which are left
only to raise desires that never can be satisfied, and
sorrow which never can be comforted. Had all the
writings of the ancients been faithfully delivered down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
from age to age, had the <i>Alexandrian library</i> been
spared, and the Palatine repositories remained unimpaired,
how much might we have known of which
we are now doomed to be ignorant, how many laborious
inquiries and dark conjectures, how many
collations of broken hints and mutilated passages
might have been spared! We should have known
the successions of princes, the revolutions of empires,
the actions of the great, and opinions of the wise, the
laws and constitutions of every state, and the arts by
which public grandeur and happiness are acquired
and preserved. We should have traced the progress
of life, seen colonies from distant regions take possession
of European deserts, and troops of savages
settled into communities by the desire of keeping what
they had acquired; we should have traced the progress
and utility, and travelled upward to the original
of things by the light of history, till in remoter times
it had glimmered in fable, and at last been left in
darkness."&mdash;"For my own part," says Gibbon, "I
am strongly tempted to deny both the fact and the
consequences." Dr. Drake also is disposed to believe,
that the privations we have suffered have been occasioned
by ignorance, negligence, and intemperate
zeal, operating uniformly for centuries, and not
through the medium of either concerted or accidental
conflagration<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.</p>

<p>The dominion of the Turks, and the discovery of
the Cape of Good Hope, in 1499, completed its ruin;
and from that time it has remained in decay. Its large
buildings fell into ruins, and under a government
which discouraged even the appearance of wealth,
no person would venture to repair them, and mean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
habitations were constructed in lieu of them, on the
sea-coast. Since that dismal epoch Egypt has, century
after century, sunk deeper and deeper into a state
of perfect neglect and ruin. In recent times, however,
it has been under the immediate despotic rule of Mehemet
Ali, nominally a pasha of the sultan of Constantinople,
and a man apparently able and willing
to do much towards restoring civilisation to the place
of his birth.</p>

<p>The remains, in the opinion of some, have been
greatly magnified. One writer<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>, for instance, states,
"The present state of Alexandria affords a scene of
magnificence and desolation. In the space of two
leagues, inclosed by walls, nothing is seen but the
remains of pilasters, of capitals, and of obelisks, and
whole mountains of shattered columns and monuments
of ancient art, heaped upon one another, and
accumulated to a height even greater than that of
the houses." Another writer<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> says, "Alexandria
now exhibits every mark by which it could be recognised
as one of the principal monuments of the magnificence
of the conqueror of Asia, the emporium of
the East, and the chosen theatre of the far-sought
luxuries of the Roman triumvirs and the Egyptian
queen."</p>

<p>According to Sonnini, columns subverted and
scattered about; a few others still upright but
isolated; mutilated statues, fragments of every species,
overspread the ground which it once occupied. "It
is impossible to advance a step, without kicking, if I
may use the expression, against some of its wrecks.
It is the hideous theatre of destruction the most
horrible. The soul is saddened on contemplating
those remains of grandeur and magnificence; and it
is raised into indignation against the barbarians, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
dared to apply a sacrilegious hand to monuments,
which time, the most pitiless of destroyers, would
have respected." "So little," says Dr. Clarke, "are
we acquainted with these valuable remains, that not
a single excursion for purposes of discovery has yet
been begun; nor is there any thing published with
regard to its modern history, excepting the observations
that have resulted from the hasty survey, made
of its forlorn and desolated havens by a few travellers
whose transitory visits ended almost with the days
of their arrival<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>."</p>

<p>"On arriving at Alexandria," says Mr. Wilkinson,
"the traveller naturally enquires where are the
remains of that splendid city, which was second only to
Rome itself, and whose circuit of fifteen miles contained
a population of three hundred thousand inhabitants and
an equal number of slaves; and where the monuments
of its former greatness? He has heard of Cleopatra's
Needle and Pompey's Pillar, from the days of his
childhood, and the fame of its library, the Pharos,
the temple of Serapis and of those philosophers
and mathematicians, whose venerable names contribute
to the fame of Alexandria, even more than the
extent of its commerce or the splendour of the monuments,
that once adorned it, are fresh in his recollection;&mdash;and
he is surprised, in traversing mounds
which mark the site of this vast city, merely to find
scattered fragments or a few isolated columns, and
here and there the vestiges of buildings, or the
doubtful direction of some of the main streets."</p>

<p>Though the ancient boundaries, however, cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a>
be determined, heaps of rubbish are on all sides
visible; whence every shower of rain, not to mention
the industry of the natives in digging, discovers pieces
of precious marble, and sometimes ancient coins, and
fragments of sculpture. Among the last may be
particularly mentioned the statues of Marcus Aurelius
and Septimius Severus.</p>

<p>The present walls are of Saracenic structure. They
are lofty; being in some places more than forty feet
in height, and apparently no where so little as
twenty. These furnish a sufficient security against
the Bedouins, who live part of the year on the banks
of the canal, and often plunder the cattle in the
neighbourhood. The few flocks and herds, which are
destined to supply the wants of the city, are pastured
on the herbage, of which the vicinity of the canal
favours the growth, and generally brought in at
night when the two gates are shut. "Judge," says
M. Miot, "by Volney's first pages, of the impression
which must be made upon us, by these houses with
grated windows; this solitude, this silence, these
camels; these disgusting dogs covered with vermin;
these hideous women holding between their teeth the
corner of a veil of coarse blue cloth to conceal from
us their features and their black bosoms. At the
sight of Alexandria and its inhabitants, at beholding
these vast plains devoid of all verdure, at breathing
the burning air of the desert, melancholy began to
find its way among us; and already some Frenchmen,
turning towards their country their weary eyes,
let the expression of regret escape them in sighs; a
regret which more painful proofs were soon to render
more poignant." And this recals to one's recollection
the description of an Arabic poet, cited by Abulfeda
several centuries ago.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p class="noidt">"How pleasant are the banks of the canal of Alexandria;
when the eye surveys them the heart is rejoiced! the
gliding boatman, beholding its towers, beholds canopies
ever verdant; the lovely Aquilon breathes cooling freshness,
while he, sportful, ripples up the surface of its waters;
the ample Date, whose flexible head reclines like a sleeping
beauty, is crowned with pendent fruit."</p></div>

<p>The walls to which we have alluded present
nothing curious, except some ruinous towers; and
one of the chief remains of the ancient city is a
colonnade, of which only a few columns remain; and
what is called the amphitheatre, on a rising ground,
whence there is a fine view of the city and port.
There is, however, one structure beside particularly
entitled to distinction; and that is generally styled
Pompey's Pillar.</p>

<p>Pompey's Pillar, says the author of Egyptian
Antiquities, "stands on a small eminence midway
between the walls of Alexandria and the shores of
the lake Mareotis, about three-quarters of a mile
from either, quite detached from any other building.
It is of a red granite; but the shaft, which is highly
polished, appears to be of earlier date than the
capital or pedestal, which have been made to correspond.
It is of the Corinthian order; and while some
have eulogised it as the finest specimen of that order,
others have pronounced it to be in bad taste. The
capital is of palm leaves, not indented. The column
consists only of three pieces&mdash;the capital, the shaft,
and the base&mdash;and is poised on a centre stone of
breccia, with hieroglyphics on it, less than a fourth
of the dimensions of the pedestal of the column, and
with the smaller end downward; from which circumstance
the Arabs believe it to have been placed
there by God. The earth about the foundation has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
been examined, probably in the hopes of finding
treasures; and pieces of white marble, (which is not
found in Egypt) have been discovered connected to
the breccia above mentioned. It is owing, probably,
to this disturbance that the pillar has an inclination
of about seven inches to the south-west. This
column has sustained some trifling injury at the
hands of late visiters, who have indulged a puerile
pleasure in possessing and giving to their friends
small fragments of the stone, and is defaced by being
daubed with names of persons, which would otherwise
have slumbered unknown to all save in their
own narrow sphere of action; practices which cannot
be too highly censured, and which an enlightened
mind would scorn to be guilty of. It is remarkable,
that while the polish on the shaft is still perfect to
the northward, corrosion has begun to affect the
southern face, owing probably to the winds passing
over the vast tracts of sand in that direction. The
centre part of the cap-stone has been hollowed out,
forming a basin on the top; and pieces of iron
still remaining in four holes prove that this pillar was
once ornamented with a figure, or some other trophy.
The operation of forming a rope-ladder to ascend
the column has been performed several times of late
years, and is very simple: a kite was flown, with a
string to the tail, and, when directly over the pillar,
it was dragged down, leaving the line by which it
was flown across the capital. With this a rope, and
afterwards a stout hawser, was drawn over; a man
then ascended and placed two more parts of the hawser,
all of which were pulled tight down to a twenty-four-pounder
gun lying near the base (which it was
said Sir Sidney Smith attempted to plant on the top);
small spars were then lashed across, commencing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
from the bottom, and ascending each as it was
secured, till the whole was complete, when it
resembled the rigging of a ship's lower masts. The
mounting this solitary column required some nerve,
even in seamen; but it was still more appalling to
see the Turks, with their ample trowsers, venture the
ascent. The view from this height is commanding,
and highly interesting in the associations excited by
gazing on the ruins of the city of the Ptolemies,
lying beneath. A theodolite was planted there, and
a round of terrestrial angles taken; but the tremulous
motion of the column affected the quicksilver in
the artificial horizon so much as to preclude the
possibility of obtaining an observation for the latitude.
Various admeasurements have been given of the
dimensions of Pompey's Pillar; the following, however,
were taken by a gentleman who assisted in the
operation above described:&mdash;</p>

<p>Shaw says, that in his time, in expectation of
finding a large treasure buried underneath, a great part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of the foundation, consisting of several fragments of
different sorts of stone and marble, had been removed;
so that the whole fabric rested upon a block of white
marble scarcely two yards square, which, upon
touching it with a key, sounded like a bell.</p>

<p>All travellers agree that its present appellation is
a misnomer; yet it is known that a monument of
some kind was erected at Alexandria to the memory
of Pompey, which was supposed to have been found
in this remarkable column. Mr. Montague thinks it
was erected to the honour of Vespasian. Savary
calls it the Pillar of Severus. Clarke supposes it to
have been dedicated to Hadrian, according to his
reading of a half-effaced inscription in Greek on the
west side of the base; while others trace the name of
Diocletian in the same inscription. No mention
occurring of it either in Strabo or Diodorus Siculus,
we may safely infer that it did not exist at that
period; and Denon supposes it to have been erected
about the time of the Greek Emperors, or of the
Caliphs of Egypt, and dates its acquiring its present
name in the fifteenth century. It is supposed to
have been surmounted with an equestrian statue.
The shaft is elegant and of a good style; but the
capital and pedestal are of inferior workmanship,
and have the appearance of being of a different
period.</p>

<p>In respect to the inscription on this pillar, there
are two different readings:&mdash;It must, however, be
remembered, that many of the letters are utterly
illegible.</p>

<p class="center"><small>
TO DIOCLETIANUS AUGUSTUS,<br />
MOST ADORABLE EMPEROR,<br />
THE TUTELAR DEITY OF ALEXANDRIA,<br />
PONTIUS, A PREFECT OF EGYPT,<br />
CONSECRATES THIS.<br />
</small></p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>Dr. Clarke's version is&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><small>
POSTHUMUS, PR&AElig;FECT OF EGYPT,<br />
AND THE PEOPLE OF THE METROPOLIS,<br />
[<i>honour</i>] TO THE MOST REVERED EMPEROR,<br />
THE PROTECTING DIVINITY OF ALEXANDRIA,<br />
THE DIVINE HADRIAN AUGUSTUS.<br />
</small></p>

<p>Now, since it is known that Hadrian lived from
<small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 76 to 130, it seems clear that Pompey has no
connexion with this pillar, and that it ought no longer
to bear his name. Some writers, however, are disposed
to believe that the inscription is not so old as the
pillar, and this is very likely to be the case.</p>

<p>This celebrated pillar has of late years been several
times ascended. The manner, as we have before stated,
was this:&mdash;"By means of a kite, a strong cord was
passed over the top of the column, and securely fastened
on one side, while one man climbed up the other. When
he had reached the top, he made the rope still more
secure, and others ascended, carrying with them
water of the Thames, of the Nile, and of one of the
Grecian Islands: a due supply of spirits was also
provided, and thus a bowl of punch was concocted;
and the healths of distinguished persons were drunk.
This ascent was made when the British fleet was in
Egypt, since which time the ascents have been
numerous; for, according to Mr. Webster, the crew
of almost every man-of-war which has been stationed
in the port of Alexandria have thought the national
honour of British tars greatly concerned in ascending
the height of fame, or, in other words, the famous
height which Pompey's pillar affords. It is not
unusual for a party to take breakfast, write letters,
and transact other matters of business on this very
summit; and it is on record that a lady once had
courage to join one of these high parties."</p>

<p>Besides this there are two obelisks. The first is of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
granite, and is called Cleopatra's Needle, but it has
become nearly certain that it was removed hither
from Heliopolis, and it is now, therefore, regarded as
the obelisk of Thothmes III. Its fallen companion
also bears the name of Thothmes, and, in the lateral
lines of Remeses II, the supposed Sesostris. One of
these is still upright on its base; the other is thrown
down and almost entirely buried in the sand. "The
former," says Sonnini, "shows what the hand of man
can do against time; the other what time can do
against the efforts of man."</p>

<p>They are both of red granite. According to a survey
made by Dr. Clarke, the base of the prostrate one
measures seven feet square, and the length is sixty-six
feet. They are both covered with hieroglyphics
cut into the stone to the depth of two inches. These
two monuments served to decorate one of the entrances
to the palace of the Ptolemies, the ruins of which are
contiguous<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.</p>

<p>Nothing<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, however, which remains in the vicinity
of Alexandria attests its greatness more satisfactorily
than the catacombs on the coast, near the
Necropolis. Their size, although remarkable, is not
so striking as the elegant symmetry, and proportion
of the architecture in the first chamber, which is of
the best Greek style, and not to be equalled in any
other part of Egypt.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> They are at a short distance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
from the canal, and are galleries, penetrating a prodigious
way under ground, or rather into the rock.
They are supposed to have been at first the quarries,
which furnished stones for the construction of the
edifices of Alexandria; and, after having supplied the
men of that country with the materials of their habitations,
while they lived, are themselves become their
last abode after death. Most of these subterraneous
alleys are in a ruinous state. In the small number
of those which it is possible to penetrate, are seen,
on both sides, three rows of coffins, piled on each
other. At the entrance of some of these galleries
there are separate apartments, with their coffins;
reserved, no doubt, for the sepulture of particular
families, or of a peculiar order of citizens. These
catacombs frequently serve as retreats for the jackals,
which abound in this part of Egypt, prowling in
numerous squadrons, and roaming around the habitations
of man. These pernicious animals are not afraid
of advancing close up to the walls of the city. Nay,
more; they traverse its enclosure during the night;
they frequently spring over it by the breaches made
in the walls; they enter the city itself in quest of
their prey, and fill it with howlings and cries. Dr.
Clarke says, that nothing so marvellous ever fell
within his observation<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>. Of the singular suburb
styled the Necropolis or "city of the dead," nothing
remains. But about sixty yards east of some excavations
called the "Baths of Cleopatra," there is a little
bay, about sixty yards deep, with an entrance so
nearly blocked up by two rocks, that a boat only
can obtain access<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. At the bottom of this bay, in
the steep slope of the shore, there is a small hole,
through which it is difficult to pass: a passage of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
about thirty feet leads to the first hall, in which the
visitor can stand upright; on the right and left are
small square chambers, much filled up with sand, the
ceiling and cornice supported by pilasters. The former
is vaulted, and covered with a crystalized cement, on
which are traced, in red, lines obviously forming geometrical
configurations on the subject of astronomy.
A sun is represented in the middle of the vault. The
upright sides contain vaulted niches; the hall is
about twenty yards square. From this a door, in the
opposite side, leads to a larger hall, but the sand fills
it up from the floor to the ceiling at the further end,
so that its dimensions cannot be ascertained. Two
small chambers, as before, are excavated on two sides
of this also; in the right-hand one there is an opening
in the wall, leading to a vast corridor, thirty-six feet
long and twelve broad, half choked up, three wells
in the roof having probably served to admit the
rubbish. This leads to another fine apartment, with
a portico on each of its four sides, three of which
have pilasters and cornice, richly carved; the other
parts of the wall are left quite plain, but there are
lines traced on the vaulted ceiling, indicating that it
was intended to have been cut into panels, with
roses in the centres. From this chamber you enter
a beautiful rotunda, on the left, which appears to be
the principal object of the excavation; it is seven
yards in diameter, and about five high; it is regularly
ornamented with pilasters supporting a cornice, from
which springs the cupola of the ceiling; nine tombs,
decorated like those first described, are seen around
it. The bottom is level with the sea; the water
filters through, and is found a short distance below
the floor. This place is quite free from sand, so that
the whole of it can be seen; and the effect, when
illuminated by many torches, the light of which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
reflected from the cement, is very grand. The
chamber preceding the rotunda also affords access to
another corridor, leading to various apartments,
presenting similar appearances to those already described.
In one of them there is the springing of a
brick-arch running round it, intended, apparently, to
support a gallery; beneath is a hole, about half a
yard square, which is the entrance to a winding
passage; but it is impossible to penetrate it far on
account of the sand and water. It is conjectured to
have served for some religious mystery, or for some
imposition of the priests on the common people.
Through the centre portico of another chamber,
similar to that before described, but left unfinished,
like many other parts of this magnificent tomb, an
apartment is entered, each side of which has three
ranges of holes for the reception of embalmed bodies,
and pits of various dimensions are dug in the floors
of several of the rooms. There is a great symmetry
in the arrangement of all the apartments, so that the
plan of the excavation is regular. It was probably
intended for a royal cemetery, the bodies of the
sovereigns being deposited in the rotunda, and the
other chambers serving as places of burial for their
relatives, according to their rank; and two large side
chapels, with collateral rooms, being appropriated to
the religious rites of the Goddess Hecate; as is
rendered probable by the crescents which ornament
various parts of the place. Whatever was its destination,
like all the other cemeteries of Egypt it has
been ransacked at some remote period, and the bodies
of its tenants removed.</p>

<p>Like all the other distinguished nations of antiquity,
Egypt, after a lengthened period of civil power,
military glory, and dignified learning, suffered a
series of reverses of fortune, and finally sank into a
state of poverty and barbaric ignorance. Modern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Cairo rose upon the ruins of Alexandria, and has
been enriched with its spoils; since thither have been
conveyed, at various times, not fewer than forty thousand
columns of granite, porphyry, and marble;
erected in the private dwellings and mosques. Its
decay doubtless was gradual, but fifteen centuries,
during which it has declined, have evinced its ancient
opulence by the slowness of its fall.</p>

<p>In respect to its modern condition, among heaps
of rubbish, and among fine gardens, planted with
palms, oranges, and citrons, are seen some churches,
mosques, and monasteries, with three small clusters
of dwellings<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.</p>

<p>This city was founded by a colony from Miletus
and Athens, who preserved their independence till
they were conquered by the Persians. They succeeded
in maintaining their liberties under Alexander.</p>

<p>During a war with Mithridates, king of Pontus,
Lucullus, the Roman general, laid strong siege
to this town; and while so engaged, his troops
murmured against him:&mdash;"Our general," said they,
"amuses himself with sieges, which, after all, are not
worth the trouble he bestows upon them." When
Lucullus heard this, he replied: "You accuse me
of giving the enemy time to augment his army
and regain his strength. That is just what I want.
I act in this manner for no other purpose; in
order that our enemy may take new courage, and
assemble so numerous an army as may embolden
him to expect us in the field, and no longer fly before
us. Do you not observe, that he has behind him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
immense solitudes and infinite deserts in which it is
impossible for us to come up with or pursue him?
Armenia is but a few days march from these deserts.
There Tigranes keeps his court,&mdash;that king of kings,
whose power is so great, that he subdues the Parthians,
transports whole cities of Greeks into the
heart of Media, has made himself master of Syria
and Palestine, exterminated the kings descended from
Seleucus, and carried their wives and daughters into
captivity. This powerful prince is the ally and son-in-law
of Mithridates. Do you think, when he has
him in his palaces, as a suppliant, that he will
abandon himself, and not make war against us?
Hence, in hastening to drive away Mithridates, we
shall be in great danger of drawing Tigranes upon
our hands, who has long sought pretexts for declaring
against us, and who can never find one more
specious, legitimate, and honourable, than that of
assisting his father-in-law, and a king, reduced to
the last extremity. Why, therefore, should we serve
Mithridates against ourselves; or show him to whom
he should have recourse for the means of supporting
the war with us, by pushing him against his will,&mdash;and
at a time, perhaps, when he looks upon such a
step as unworthy his valour and greatness,&mdash;into the
arms and protection of Tigranes? Is it not infinitely
better, by giving him time to take courage and
strengthen himself with his own forces, to have only
upon our hands the troops of Colchis, the Tibarenians,
and Cappadocians, whom we have so often
defeated, than to expose ourselves to have the additional
force of the Armenians and Medes to contend
with?"</p>

<p>Lucullus soon after this marched against Mithridates,
and in three engagements defeated him.
Mithridates, however, escaped, and almost immediately
after sent commands to his two sisters and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
his two wives, that they should die; he being in
great fear that they would fall into the hands of the
enemy. Their history is thus related:&mdash;When the
officer, whose name was Bacchides, arrived where
they were, and had signified to the princesses the
orders of their king, which favoured them no further
than to leave them at liberty to choose the kind of
death they should think most gentle and immediate;
Monima taking the diadem from her head, tied it
round her neck, and hung herself with it. But that
wreath not being strong enough, and breaking, she
cried out&mdash;"Ah! fatal trifle, you might at least do
me this mournful office." Then, throwing it away
with indignation, she presented her neck to Bacchides.
As for Berenice, she took a cup of poison;
and as she was going to drink it, her mother, who
was with her, desired to share it with her. They
accordingly drank both together. The half of that
cup sufficed to carry off the mother, worn out and
feeble with age; but was not enough to surmount
the strength and youth of Berenice. That princess,
therefore, struggled long with death in the most
violent agonies; till Bacchides, tired with waiting
the effect of the poison, ordered her to be strangled.
Of the two sisters, Roxana is said to have swallowed
poison, venting reproaches and imprecations against
Mithridates. Statira, on the contrary, was pleased
with her brother, and thanked him, that being in so
great a danger for his own person, he had not forgot
them, and had taken care to supply them with the
means of dying free, and of withdrawing from the
indignities their enemies might else have made them
undergo. Their deaths afflicted Lucullus very sensibly;
for he was of a very gentle and humane disposition.</p>

<p>Lucullus, in the mean time, laid strong siege to
Amisus.  Mithridates had given the conduct of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the place to Callimachus, who was esteemed the
best engineer of his time. That officer held out
for a long time very skilfully, and with the utmost
gallantry; but finding at last that the town must
surrender, he set fire to it, and escaped in a ship that
waited for him. Lucullus did all he could to extinguish
the flames; but, for the most part, in vain;
and the whole city had undoubtedly been burned, had
not a rain fallen so violently, that a considerable
number of houses were thereby saved; and before he
departed, the conqueror caused those that had been
burned, to be rebuilt; but so inveterate were his soldiers,
that all his efforts could not secure it from
plunder.</p>

<p>It was afterwards the favourite residence of Pompey
the Great, who rebuilt the city, and restored the
inhabitants to their liberties, which were confirmed
by C&aelig;sar and Augustus. In subsequent times it
was included in the dominions of the Commeni emperors
of Trebisond; and finally subdued by the
Turks in the reign of Mahomet the Second.</p>

<p>It is now surrounded by a decayed wall. Towards
the sea may be traced the remains of another wall;
the ruins of these, in many parts, are almost buried
under the waves<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="NO_X_ANTIOCH" id="NO_X_ANTIOCH"></a>NO. X.&mdash;ANTIOCH.</h2>


<p>There are few cities whose immediate origin we
know so well as that of Antioch.</p>

<p>Antigonus had built a city at a small distance
from the spot on which Antioch was afterwards
erected, and this he called after his own name, Antigonia.
After his death Seleucus, having made himself
master of Upper Syria, determined on founding a
city. He, in consequence, demolished the one Antigonus
had built, and employed its materials in con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>structing
his own<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. This he named after his son,
Antiochus. He afterwards transplanted all the
citizens to the new capital; and he adorned it with
all the beauty and elegance of Grecian architecture.</p>

<p>Seleucus built several other cities in the same
direction, amongst which may be particularly noticed
Apamea, which he named after his wife, the daughter
of Arbazus the Persian; and Laodicea, which he called
after his mother. Apamea was situated on the same
river as Antioch, and Laodicea in the southern part
of the same quarter. What is rather remarkable is,
that in these cities he allowed the Jews the same
privileges and immunities as were enjoyed by the
Greeks and Macedonians; more especially at Antioch,
where that people settled in such numbers that at
length they possessed as large a portion of the city
as their countrymen enjoyed at Alexandria.</p>

<p>In the Christian times it was the see of the chief
patriarch of Asia. It is often mentioned in the Acts
of the Apostles, and particularly wherein it is said,
that the disciples of Christ were here first called
Christians; and in the river Orontes, according to
tradition, St. Paul is said to have been baptised.
The city, at various times, has suffered severely from
the rage of bigotry and superstition, inseparably
attached to the zealots of the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, when the spirit of enthusiasm, roused by
designing priests, induced the powers of Europe to
attempt the reduction of Syria and the Holy Land.</p>

<p>Antioch has several times been subjected to the
violence of earthquakes, and several times been
afflicted with great famine; and when Chosroes
invaded Syria, the city, disdaining the offers of an
easy capitulation, was taken by storm, the inhabitants
slaughtered with unrelenting fury, and the city itself
delivered to the flames. It recovered, however, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
a time, and was again visited by earthquake, and the
sword of the conqueror. It was taken by the Crusaders
<small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 1098; and in 1262 all its glory terminated;
having been taken possession of by Bybaris, sultan
of Egypt.</p>

<p>It is now a ruinous town, the houses of which are
built of mud and straw, and exhibit every appearance
of poverty and wretchedness. The walls, however, of
each quarter, as well as those which surrounded the
whole, are still remaining; but as the houses are
destroyed, the four quarters appear like so many
inclosed fields.</p>

<p>It is said that this city, which was about four
miles in circumference, was built at four different
times, and consisted in a manner of four cities, divided
from one another by walls. The first, as we have
already stated, was built by Seleucus Nicator; the
second by those who flocked thither after the building
of the first; the third by Seleucus Callinicus; and
the fourth by Antiochus Epiphanes, king of Syria.
The present town, which is a mile in circumference,
stands in the plain, on the north-west part
of the old city; all the parts within the walls being
converted into gardens. The walls, which now
exist, though much ruined, mark the ancient boundaries
of Antioch. They were built since the introduction
of Christianity; the form of them being
nearly of a rectangular figure.</p>

<p>There are, as we have already stated, very few
remains within the city of any ancient buildings.
The principal works are the aqueducts, and some
grottoes cut in the mountain. There were once two
temples of great celebrity, one of which was dedicated
to Apollo and the other to the Moon. At this
moment not a vestige of these is to be discovered.
"Formerly," says Lord Sandwich, "it had a port of
considerable importance on the north bank of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Orontes, and on the shores of the Levant; but the
harbour is choked up, and not a single inhabitant
remains. The sun of Antioch is set. The present
city is a miserable place, extending four hundred
yards from the side of the river to the bottom of a
mountain, on the summit of which, and round the
town, the crusaders, during their being in possession
of Syria, built a strong wall. Nothing remains of
its ancient grandeur besides some stupendous causeways
and massy gateways of hewn stone."</p>

<p>At a distance of about four or five miles was a place
called Daphne. There Seleucus planted a grove, and
in the midst of it he erected a temple, which he consecrated
to Apollo and Diana. To this place the
inhabitants of Antioch resorted for their pleasures
and diversions, till at last it became so infamous, that
"to live after the manner of Daphne" was used proverbially
to express the most voluptuous and dissolute
mode of living.</p>

<p>Antioch is said to have been once greater than
Rome itself; but often ruined, and finally razed by the
Mamelukes, it is now only a small town, known by
the name of Antakia. Its climate is so agreeable,
that we may cite some observations, made in regard
to it in a passage in Mr. Robinson's tour in Palestine
and Syria. "For the breadth and brilliancy of the
eastern landscape, there is no architecture equal to
the Oriental. The solemnity and grandeur of the
Gothic are suited to our climate of cloud and tempest.
The severe or even the florid beauty of Greek architecture
belongs to a country where the spectator sees
it under the lights and shadows of a sky as picturesque
as the hills and valleys that it covers. But
the magnitude, strong colourings, and yet fantastic
finish of Eastern architecture are made to be seen
across its vast plains under the unclouded sky; and
glowing with the powerful splendour with which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
rising and the setting sun less illumine than inflame
the horizon. At a distance it has the dream-like
beauty which we habitually attach to the edifices of
the Arabian Nights<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="NO_XI_ARGOS" id="NO_XI_ARGOS"></a>NO. XI.&mdash;ARGOS.</h2>


<p>Argos was founded in the 1856th year before the
Christian era; that is, in the time of Abraham.
Its founder was Inachus. Euripides, however, says,
that the city was built by the Cyclops, who came
from Syria. After flourishing for about 550 years,
it was united to the crown of Mycen&aelig;. According
to Herodotus, Argos was the most famous of all the
states, comprehended under the general name of
Greece. For a long time it was the most flourishing
city in Greece; and this chiefly from its being
enriched by the commerce of Assyria and Egypt.
Its early history is resplendent with illustrious names
and shining achievements. Its inhabitants conceived a
hope of obtaining the sovereignty of all Peloponnesus;
but they became at length enfeebled and at last
ruined by intestine divisions.</p>

<p>There are many events exceedingly interesting in
the history of Argos; amongst which, these. A
war broke out, in the reign of Theopompus<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>,
between the Argives and Lacedemonians, on account
of a little country called Thyrea, that lay upon the
confines of the two states, and to which each of them
pretended a right. When the two armies were ready
to engage, it was agreed, in order to spare the effusion
of blood, that the quarrel should be decided by
three hundred of the bravest men on both sides; and
that the land in question should become the property
of the victors. To leave the combatants more room
to engage, the two armies retired to some distance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Those generous champions then, who had all the
courage of two mighty armies, boldly advanced
towards each other, and fought with so much resolution
and fury, that the whole number, except three
men, two on the side of the Argives, and one on the
side of the Lacedemonians, lay dead on the spot; and
only the night parted them. The two Argives,
looking upon themselves as the conquerors, made
what haste they could to Argos to carry the news;
the single Lacedemonian, Othryades by name, instead
of retiring, stripped the dead bodies of the Argives,
and carrying their arms into the Lacedemonian camp,
continued in his post. The next day the two armies
returned to the field of battle. Both sides laid equal
claim to the victory. The Argives, because they had
more of their champions left alive than the enemy
had; the Lacedemonians, because the two Argives that
remained alive had fled; whereas their single soldier
had remained master of the field of battle, and had
carried off the spoils of the enemy: in short, they
could not determine the dispute without coming to
another engagement. Then fortune declared in
favour of the Lacedemonians, and the little territory
of Thyrea was the prize of their victory. But
Othryades, not able to bear the thoughts of surviving
his brave companions, or of enduring the sight of
Sparta after their death, killed himself on the same
field of battle where they had fought, resolving to
have one fate and tomb with them.</p>

<p>At<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> a subsequent period, the inhabitants of Argos
despatched ambassadors to Pyrrhus and Antigonus to
entreat them to withdraw their troops, and not
reduce their city into subjection to either of them,
but to allow it to continue in a state of friendship with
both. Antigonus readily consented, and sent his son
as a hostage to the Argives. Pyrrhus, also, pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>mised
to retire; but as he offered no security for the
fulfilment of his word, they began to suspect his
sincerity; and, indeed, with sufficient reason: for as
soon as night appeared, he advanced to the walls, and
having found a door left open by Arist&aelig;us, he had
time to force his Gauls into the city; and so seize it
without being perceived. But when he would have
introduced his elephants, he found the gates too low;
which obliged him to cause the towers to be taken
down from their backs, and replaced there when
those animals had entered the city. All this could
not be effected amidst the darkness without much
trouble, noise, and confusion, which caused them to
be discovered. The Argives, when they beheld the
enemy in the city, fled to the citadel, and to those
places that were most advantageous in their defence,
and sent a deputation to Antigonus, to press his
speedy advance to their assistance. He accordingly
marched that moment, and caused his son, with the
other officers, to enter the city at the head of his best
troops. In this very juncture of time, King Areus
also arrived at Argos, with a thousand Cretans, and
as many Spartans as were capable of coming. These
troops, when they had all joined each other, charged
the Gauls with the utmost fury, and put them into
disorder. Pyrrhus hastened, on his part, to sustain
them; but the darkness and confusion was then so
great, that it was impossible for him to be either
obeyed or heard. When day appeared, he was not a
little surprised to see the citadel full of enemies; and
as he then imagined all was lost, he thought of
nothing but a timely retreat. But as he had some
apprehension with respect to the city gates, which
were much too narrow, he sent orders to his
son, Helenus, whom he had left without with the
greatest part of the army, to demolish part of the
wall, that his troops might have a free passage out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
of the city. The person to whom Pyrrhus gave this
order in great haste, having misunderstood his meaning,
delivered a quite contrary message; in consequence
of which, Helenus drew out his best infantry,
with all the elephants he had left, and then advanced
into the city to assist his father, who was preparing
to retire, the moment the other entered the place.</p>

<p>Pyrrhus, as long as the place afforded him a sufficient
extent of ground, appeared with a resolute
mien, and frequently faced about and repulsed those
who pursued him; but when he found himself
engaged in a narrow street, which ended at the gate,
the confusion, which already was very great, became
infinitely increased by the arrival of the troops his
son brought to his assistance. He frequently called
aloud to them to withdraw, in order to clear the
streets, but in vain; for as it was impossible for his
voice to be heard, they still continued to advance;
and to complete the calamity in which they were
involved, one of the largest elephants sank down in
the middle of the gate, and filled the whole extent in
such a manner, that the troops could neither advance
nor retire. The confusion occasioned by this accident
became then inextricable.</p>

<p>Pyrrhus observing the disorder of his men, who
broke forward and were driven back, took off the
glittering crest, which distinguished his helmet, and
caused him to be known, and then, confiding in the
goodness of his horse, he sprang into the throng of
his enemies who pursued him; and while he was
fighting with an air of desperation, one of the
adverse party advanced up to him, and pierced
his cuirass with a javelin. The wound, however,
was neither great nor dangerous, and Pyrrhus immediately
turned upon the man from whom he had
received it, and who happened to be only a private
soldier, the son of a poor woman at Argos: the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
mother beholding the contest from the top of a
house, where she stood with several other women.
The moment she saw her son engaged with Pyrrhus,
she almost lost her senses, and chilled with horror at
the danger to which she beheld him exposed. Amidst
the impressions of her agony, she caught up a large
tile, and threw it down upon Pyrrhus. The mass
fell directly upon his head, and his helmet being too
weak to ward off the blow, his hands dropped the
reins, and he sank down from his horse without being
observed. But he was soon discovered by a soldier,
who put an end to his life, by cutting off his head.</p>

<p>There is another circumstance related of Argos,
which it gives us great pleasure in remarking. When
Solon was at the court of Cr&#339;sus, the king asked
him&mdash;"Who, of all those he had seen, was the next
in felicity to Tellus." Solon answered, 'Cleobis and
Biton of Argos, two brothers, who had left behind
them a perfect pattern of fraternal affection, and of
the respect due from children to their parents. Upon
a solemn festival, when their mother, a priestess of
Juno, was to go to the temple, the oxen that were to
draw her not being ready, the two sons put themselves
to the yoke, and drew their mother's chariot
thither, which was above five miles distant. All the
mothers of the place, ravished with admiration, congratulated
the priestess on the piety of her sons.
She, in the transports of her joy and thankfulness,
earnestly entreated the goddess to reward her children
with the best thing that Heaven can give to
man. Her prayers were heard. When the sacrifice
was over, her two sons fell asleep in the very temple,
and there died in a soft and peaceful slumber. In
honour of their piety, the people of Argos consecrated
statues to them in the temple of Delphos.</p>

<p>"If Athens," says Dr. Clarke, "by arts, by
military talents, and by costly solemnities, became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
<i>one of the eyes of Greece</i>, there was in the humanity
of Argos, and in the good feeling displayed by its
inhabitants, a distinction which comes nearer to the
heart. Something characteristic of the people may
be observed even in a name given to one of their
divinities; for they worshipped a 'God of Meekness.'
It may be said, perhaps, of the Argive character,
that it was less splendid than the Athenian,
and less rigid than the Laced&aelig;monian; but it was
less artificial, and the contrast it exhibited, when
opposed to the infamous profligacy of Corinth, where
the manners of the people, corrupted by wealth and
luxury, were further vitiated by the great influx of
foreigners, rendered Argos, in the days of her prosperity,
one of the most enviable cities of Greece.
The stranger, who visited Athens, might, indeed,
regard, with an eager curiosity, the innumerable
trophies every where suspended of victors in her
splendid games; might admire her extensive porticoes
crowded with philosophers; might gaze with
wonder at the productions of her artists; might
revere her magnificent temples: but feelings more
affecting were drawn forth in beholding the numerous
monuments of the Argives, destined to perpetuate
the memory of individuals who had rendered themselves
illustrious by their virtues."</p>

<p>Argos was taken, <small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 1397, by Bajazet. It was
then totally deserted, and its walls destroyed. It
was rebuilt by the Venetians, from whom, in 1463,
it was taken by the Turks; and after being retaken
by the Venetians, it was again recovered by the
Turks in the same year.</p>

<p>"But where is Argos?" inquires La Martine; "a
vast naked plain, intersected with marshes extending
in a circular form at the bottom of the gulf. It is
bounded on every side by chains of grey mountains;
at the end of the plain, about two leagues inland,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
we perceive a mound, with some fortified walls on
its summit, and which protects, by its shade, a small
town in ruins&mdash;this is Argos. Close by is the tomb
of Agamemnon."</p>

<p>The antiquities of Argos, once so numerous, may
now be comprised within a very short list. Those
seen by Pausanias were the temples of Apollo, of
Fortuna, of Jupiter, and of Minerva; sepulchres
and cenotaphs; a theatre, a forum, a gymnasium,
a stadium, a subterranean edifice, &amp;c., formed of
earth.</p>

<p>Of these now remaining<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>, are the ruins of the
theatre<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>, which was a remarkable structure, having
been entirely an excavation in the rock, and having
the appearance of three theatres instead of one. Opposite
to this are the remains of a large edifice, built
entirely of tiles. Above the theatre are those of the
Hieron of Venus, within whose temple was a statue
of the poetess Telesilla, who, at the head of a band of
heroines, repulsed from the walls the enemies of her
country, when it was attacked by the Laced&aelig;monians.
She was represented, says Pausanias, standing upon
a pillar, with the books of her poetry scattered at
her feet, in the act of regarding her helmet, which
she was about to put upon her head.</p>

<p>On the sides and lower part of the modern fortress
are still seen the remains of Cyclopian architecture,
as ancient as the citadel of Tiryns, and built in the
same style<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.</p>

<p>"This structure," says Dr. Clarke, "is mentioned
by Pausanias<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>, where he states that the inhabitants of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Mycen&aelig; were unable to demolish the walls of the
Argives, built, like those of Tiryns, by the Cyclops.
These Cyclopian walls, as well as the towers of Argos,
are noticed by Euripides, Polybius, Seneca, Strabo,
and Statius. They are also hinted at by Virgil.
At the front of the Acropolis, we found one of the
most curious tell-tale remains, yet discovered among
the thirty temples of pagan priestcraft. It was
nothing less than one of the oracular shrines of Argos,
alluded to by Pausanias, laid open to inspection like
the toy a child has broken, in order that he may see
the contrivance whereby it was made to speak. A
more interesting sight for modern curiosity can hardly
be conceived to exist among the ruins of any Grecian
city. In its original state, it has been a
temple; the farther part from the entrance where
the altar was, being an excavation of the rock,
and the front and roof constructed of baked tiles.
The altar yet remains, and part of the fictile superstructure;
but the most remarkable part of the
whole is a secret subterraneous passage, terminating
behind the altar, its entrance being at a considerable
distance towards the right of a person facing the
altar, and so cunningly contrived, as to have a small
aperture easily concealed, and level with the surface
of the rock. This was barely large enough to admit
the entrance of a single person, who, having descended
in the narrow passage, might creep along
until he arrived immediately behind the centre of the
altar; where being hid by some colossal statue, or
other screen, the sound of his voice would produce a
most imposing effect among the humble votaries
prostrate beneath, who were listening in silence upon
the floor of the sanctuary."</p>

<p>There was also in Argos a statue of Jupiter, which
had three eyes, one of which was in the middle of
the forehead.  It is not impossible but this statue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
may, one day, be found among the ruins under the
soil.</p>

<p>Argos was consecrated to Juno<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>; it was subject
to different forms of government; its people were
brave; they cultivated the arts, but neglected the
sciences. Their memory may well be cherished; for
they were, both in precept and in practice, the kindest
and most humane of all the citizens of Greece<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.</p>

<p>This city was situate on the banks of the Araxes.
It is now called Esqui-Julfa; and Chardin, Cartwright,
and Sir W. Ouseley, we believe, are almost
the only travellers who have given any description
of it. "They called it Old Julfa," says Chardin,
"to distinguish it from the Julfa which is a suburb
of Ispahan; and not without reason is it so called,
since it is totally ruined and demolished. There is
nothing further to be known of it, except the grandeur
which it once enjoyed. There are nothing but holes
and caverns made in the mountains, fitter for beasts
then men. I do not believe there is in the world a
more barren and hideous place than that of Old
Julfa, where there is neither tree nor grass to be
seen. True it is, that in the neighbourhood there are
some places more happy and fertile; yet, on the
other side it is as true, that never was any city
situated in a more dry and stony situation. There
are not more than thirty families in it, and those
Armenians."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>Julfa was ruined by Abbas the Great, and all that
art had contributed to its fortification; and this he
did in order to prevent the Turkish armies from
getting supplies of provisions during their incursions
into Persia. To this end he transplanted the inhabitants
and their cattle to other places, ruined all
their houses, fired the whole country, burnt up all
the turf and trees, and even poisoned their springs.</p>

<p>Sir John Cartwright visited this place about two
hundred years ago, and he stated the number of
houses to be two thousand, and the inhabitants ten
thousand. When Chardin was there (in 1675),
however, as we have already stated, there were not
more than thirty families. Sir W. Ouseley says, that
there were only forty-five families in 1812, and
those, apparently, of the lowest class. "Several
steep and lofty mountains," says he, "offer very
extraordinary aspects. Many huge masses of rock
had lately fallen during earthquakes; and the whole
country round bespeaks some ancient and tremendous
commotion of nature<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>."</p>

<h2><a name="NO_XIII_ARSINOE" id="NO_XIII_ARSINOE"></a>NO. XIII.&mdash;ARSINOE.</h2>


<p>Arsinoe was situated near the lake of M&#339;ris, on
the west shore of the Nile, where the inhabitants
paid the highest veneration to crocodiles. They nourished
them in a splendid manner, embalmed them
after they were dead, and buried them in the subterranean
cells of the Labyrinth; thence the city was
called, in ancient times, Crocodilopolis<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. When the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Greeks conquered Egypt they altered its name to
Arsinoe.</p>

<p>This name it retained in the time of Adrian, and
Greek medals were struck here in honour of that
emperor as well as of Trajan. Its ruins are thus
described by Belzoni:&mdash;"On the morning of the
7th I went to see the ruins of the ancient Arsinoe;
it had been a very large city, but nothing
of it remains except high mounds of all sorts of
rubbish. The chief materials appear to have been
burnt bricks. There were many stone edifices, and a
great quantity of wrought granite. In the present
town of Medinet I observed several fragments of granite
columns and other pieces of sculpture, of a most
magnificent taste. It is certainly strange that granite
columns are only to be seen in this place and near the
Pyramids, six miles distant. Among the ruins at
Arsinoe I also observed various fragments of statues
of granite, well executed, but much mutilated; and
it is my opinion that this town has been destroyed by
violence and fire. It is clearly seen that the new
town of Medinet is built out of the old town of
Arsinoe, as the fragments are to be met with in every
part of the town. The large blocks of stone have
been diminished in their sizes, but enough is left to
show the purposes for which they originally served.
About the centre of the ruins I made an excavation in
an ancient reservoir, which I found to be as deep as the
bottom of the Bahr-Yousef, and which was, no doubt,
filled at the time of the inundation, for the accommodation
of the town. There are other similar wells in
these ruins, which prove that this was the only mode
they had of keeping water near them, as the river is at
some distance from the town. Among these mounds
I found several specimens of glass, of Grecian manufacture
and Egyptian workmanship, and it appears to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
me, that this town must have been one of the first
note in Egypt."</p>

<p>Near this city was the Labyrinth, so greatly celebrated
in ancient times, that Pliny regarded it as the
most astonishing effort of human genius. Herodotus
saw it, and assures us that it was still more surprising
than the Pyramids. It was built at the
southernmost part of the lake of M&#339;ris. It was not
so much one single palace as a magnificent pile, composed
of twelve palaces, regularly disposed, which
had a communication with each other. Fifteen
hundred rooms, interspersed with terraces, were ranged
round twelve halls, and discovered no outlet to such
as went to see them. There were the like number of
buildings under ground. Those subterraneous structures
were designed for the burying-place of the
kings; "and who," says Rollin, "can say this without
confusion, and without deploring the blindness of
man, for keeping the sacred crocodiles, which a nation,
so wise in other respects, worshipped as gods?" In
order to visit the rooms and halls of the Labyrinth,
he continues, it was necessary, as the reader will
necessarily suppose, for people to take the same precaution
as Ariadne made Theseus use, when he was
obliged to go and fight the Minotaur in the labyrinth
of Crete. Virgil describes it in this manner:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
And in the Cretan labyrinth of old,<br />
With wandering ways, and many a winding fold,<br />
Involved the weary feet without redress,<br />
In a round error, which denied recess;<br />
Not far from thence he graved the wondrous maze;<br />
A thousand doors, a thousand winding ways.<br />
</p>

<p>Of this monument no more is now to be found than
amid the ruins of Babel Caroan and Casr Caroan.
"Hereafter," says Savary, "when Europe shall have
restored to Egypt the sciences it received thence,
perhaps the sands and rubbish, which hide the subterranean
part of the Labyrinth will be removed, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
precious antiquities obtained. Who can say that the
discoveries of the learned were not preserved in this asylum,
equally impenetrable to the natives and foreigners?
If the dust of Herculaneum, an inconsiderable city,
has preserved so many rarities and instructive remains
of art and history, what may not be expected from
the fifteen hundred apartments in which the archives
of Egypt were deposited, since the governors assembled
here to treat on the most important affairs of religion
and state<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>?"</p>

<h2><a name="NO_XIV_ARTAXATA" id="NO_XIV_ARTAXATA"></a>NO. XIV.&mdash;ARTAXATA.</h2>


<p>The ruins of this city are seen at a place called
Ardachar, or, as it is more frequently called in the
East, Ardechier; sometimes Ardesh. The city rose
above the plain with fortress, palaces, and temples;
and two more splendid than the rest, one dedicated to
Anaites or Armatea, the other, a magnificent structure
to Apollo. Statues were raised in all.</p>

<p>Artaxata was the capital of Armenia, and the residence
of the Armenian kings. It was situate on a
plain, upon an elbow of the Araxes, which formed a
peninsula, and surrounded the town, except on the
side of the isthmus. This isthmus was defended by
a broad ditch and rampart.</p>

<p>It was built by Artaxias in consequence of Hannibal's
having recommended the spot as a fit place
for the king's capital; and there Artaxias' successors
resided for many generations.</p>

<p>Lucullus having defeated the Armenians, under
their king Tigranes, did not venture to lay siege to
this place, because he considered it impregnable. The
gates were, however, thrown open to the Roman general
Corbulo, but the city itself was burnt and razed. It was
afterwards called Neronia, in compliment to the emperor
Nero, who commanded Tiridates to rebuild it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
A few families, of the poorest order of people, are
now the sole occupants of this once famous city.</p>

<p>"On reaching the remains of Ardisher," says Sir
Robert Ker Porter, "I saw the earth covered to an
immense extent, and on every side, with that sort of
irregular hillocks, which are formed by Time over
piles of ruins. These, with long dyke-like ridges,
evidently by the same venerable architect, and materials
connecting them in parts, told me at once I was
entering the confines of a city, now no more. It is
not in language to describe the effect on the mind in
visiting one of these places. The space over which
the eye wanders, all marked with the memorials of
the past, but where no pillar or dome, nor household
wall of any kind, however fallen, yet remains to give
a feeling of some present existence of the place, even
by a progress in decay. All here is finished; buried
under heaps of earth; the graves, not of the people
above, but of their houses, temples, and palaces; all
lying in death-like entombment. At Anni I found
myself surrounded by a superb monument of Armenian
greatness; at Ardechier I stood over its grave.
Go where one will for lessons of Time's revolutions,
the brevity of human life, the nothingness of man's
ambition, they nowhere can strike upon the heart
like a single glance cast on one of these motionless
life-deserted 'cities of the silent<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.'"</p>

<h2><a name="NO_XV_ARTEMITA" id="NO_XV_ARTEMITA"></a>NO. XV.&mdash;ARTEMITA.</h2>


<p>Artemita was a large town in Mesopotamia,
according to Pliny the naturalist; but Strabo, more
correctly, places it in Babylonia, five hundred stadia
east of Seleucia, on the banks of the lake Arsissa, now
called Argish.</p>

<p>Though Chosroes was undoubtedly sovereign of
Ctesiphon and built the splendid palace, of which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
remains are visible; he did not approach the gates of
that city for nearly four-and-twenty years. His favourite
residence was Dustegerd (Artemita), situate on the
Tigris, not less than sixty miles north of Ctesiphon;
and here, since the length of his residence at Ctesiphon
has not been clearly ascertained, and with a view of
giving the reader some idea with respect to the power
and splendour of this prince, we will cite the description
that has been given of the wealth and magnificence
for which his name has been rendered
remarkable to all posterity. "The adjacent pastures
were covered with flocks and herds; the paradise or
park was replenished with pheasants, peacocks,
ostriches, roebucks, and wild boars; and the noble
game of lions and tigers were sometimes turned loose
for the bolder pleasures of the chase. Nine hundred
and sixty elephants were maintained for the use and
splendour of the great king; his tents and baggage
were carried into the field by twelve thousand great
camels and eight thousand of a smaller size; and the
royal stables were filled with six thousand mules and
horses, among which the names of Shebdiz and Barid
were renowned for their speed and beauty." The
treasure, which consisted of gold, silver, gems, silk,
and aromatics, were deposited in one hundred subterranean
vaults; and his palace walls are described
as having been hung with thirty thousand rich hangings,
and thousands of globes of gold were suspended
in the dome to imitate the planets and constellations
of the firmament. When this palace was sacked by
Heraclius, the conqueror found in it, as we are
informed by Cedrenus, sugar, ginger, pepper, silk
robes woven, and embroidered carpets; aloes, aloes-wood,
mataxa, silk, thread, muslins, muslin garments
without number, and a vast weight of gold bullion.</p>

<p>Dustegerd stood upon the spot where now are
seen the vast ruins of Kesra-Shirene. These have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
been described by Sir R. Ker Porter. "We are told,
that the city of Dustegerd was the most stationary
residence of Khosroo Purviz, and that it contained
his most superb palace, treasury, and public buildings.
There he passed his winters, with the beautiful
object of his idolatry<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>; and thence he flew with
her from the conquering arms of the emperor Heraclius.
We entered upon a chain of hills, amongst
which our road led in the most circuitous and intricate
mazes I had ever trod; heights and depths, ravines,
dry or water courses, rugged promontories, short
stony plains, in short, every species of mountain
difficulties, diversified our path for full fifteen miles,
till we arrived at a once formidable barrier, not far
from which we caught a view of the meandering
river Zohaub. All along the alpine bridge we
mounted, runs a massy wall of large hewn stone,
which, in many places, like a curtain, closes the openings
left by nature in the rocky bulwarks of the
country. It had evidently been intended for a defence
against any hostile approach from the eastward, and,
on passing it, we went through what had formed
one of its gates."</p>

<p>Journeying on a mile or two further, the traveller
came to a second wall, still higher and stronger, and
from that ran a third wall, which partly enclosed a
large angular space. On various spots lay large
stones of a great length, and hollowed in the middle,
as if they were the remains of some ancient covered
channel to convey water. This is still called the
aqueduct of Khosroo Purviz; and the natives told
Sir Robert, that it was one of the works constructed
by that prince to win the smiles of his beloved
Shirene.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>Numerous fragments and continuations of the great
rampart wall tracked their way, till they came to the
ruins of another wall, the position and extent of
which seemed to declare it to have been one side of
the battlements of some large and ancient city. This
they were informed was Kesra-Shirene.</p>

<p>They passed under a gateway of simple construction,
formed of hewn stones, twelve feet high and
about six in thickness. The wall ran to a considerable
distance, then disappeared, and then started up
in massy fragments; the whole seeming to have formerly
enclosed an area of several miles, and likely to
have been occupied by the streets, courts, and public
buildings of a very noble city. "The first ruined
edifice we approached," continues Sir Robert, "was
built of stone, and consists of long ranges of vaulted
rooms, nearly choked up with the fallen masses of
what may have been its magnificent superstructures.
A little onward, we came to the remains of some
place of great magnitude. It is a square building of
nearly a hundred feet along each side; four entrances
have led into the interior, and the arches of these
portals, which are falling to the last stage of decay,
cannot be less than from thirty to forty feet in height.
The walls are of equal elevation, and of a more than
ordinary thickness for any structure to stand the
brunt of war, being twelve feet in solidity. The interior
of the place, which seems to have been one
enormous chamber or hall, is covered with lime,
stones, and other fragments of masonry. No remnant
of any sculptural ornaments or inscription was
to be seen. At the southern angle of the great arch
within the city walls, on a commanding rise of
ground, stands a ruin of a stronger character; the
massiveness and form of the work proving it to
be the remains of a fortress. The building is of stone
and brick; the latter being of a large square surface,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
but not very thick. Various lofty arched chambers,
as well as deep subterraneous dungeons, compose this
noble ruin. In ranging over the rest of the ground,
contained within the circuit of the great interior
walls, we found it covered with every indication that
there had once stood the busy streets of a great and
populous city<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.</p>

They sometimes, therefore, wore golden grasshoppers

<p>The history of the first twelve monarchs is, for the
most part, fabulous.</p>

<p>Athens was founded by Cecrops, who led a colony
out of Egypt, and built twelve towns, of which he
composed a kingdom.</p>

<p>Amphictyon, the third king of Athens, procured
a confederacy between twelve nations, who met
every year at Thermopyl&aelig;, there to consult over their
affairs in general, as also upon those of each nation in
particular. This convention was called the assembly
of the Amphictyons.</p>

<p>The reign of &AElig;geus is remarkable for the Argonautic
expedition, the war of Minos, and the story
of Theseus and Ariadne.</p>

<p>&AElig;geus was succeeded by his son, Theseus, whose
exploits belong more to fable than to history.</p>

<p>The last king was Codrus, who devoted himself to
die for his people.</p>

<p>After Codrus, the title of king was extinguished
among the Athenians: his son was set at the head of
the commonwealth, with the title of Archon, which
after a time was declared to be an annual office.</p>

<p>After this Draco was allowed to legislate, and
then Solon. The laws of the former were so severe,
that they were said to be written in blood. Those
of the latter were of a different character. Pisistratus
acquired ascendancy; became a despot, and was
assassinated: whereon the Athenians recovered their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
liberties, and Hippias, the son of Pisistratus, in vain
attempted to re-establish a tyranny. The Athenians,
sometime after, burnt Sardis, a city of the Persians,
in conjunction with the Ionians; and, to revenge
this, Darius invaded Greece, but was conquered at
Marathon by Miltiades.</p>

<p>Xerxes soon after invaded Attica, and the Athenians
having taken to their "wooden walls," their
city was burnt to the ground.</p>

<p>After the victory, gained over the Persians at Salamis,
the Athenians returned to their city, but were
obliged to abandon it again; Mardonius having
wasted and destroyed every thing in its neighbourhood.
They returned to it soon after their victory
at Plat&aelig;a. Their first care, after returning to their
city, was to rebuild their walls. This measure was
opposed by the Lacedemonians, under the pretence of
its being contrary to the interest of Greece, that there
should be strong places beyond the isthmus. Their
real motive, however, was suspected to be an aversion
to the rising greatness of the Athenians. Themistocles
conducted himself with great art in this
matter<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>. He got himself appointed ambassador to
Sparta; and before setting out he caused all the
citizens, of every age and sex, to apply themselves to
the task of building the walls, making use of any
materials within their reach. Fragments of houses,
temples, and other buildings, were accordingly employed,
producing a grotesque appearance, which remained
to the days of Plutarch. He then set out for
Sparta; but, on various pretences, declined entering on
his commission, till he had received intelligence that
the work he had set on foot was nearly completed.
He then went boldly to the Lacedemonian senate, declared
what had been done, and justified it, not only
by natural right of the Athenians to provide for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
their own defence, but by the advantage of opposing
such an obstacle to the progress of the barbarians.
The Lacedemonians, sensible of the justice of this
argument, and seeing that remonstrance would now
avail nothing, were fain to acquiesce.</p>

<p>No city in the world can boast, in such a short space
of time, of such a number of illustrious citizens, equally
celebrated for their humanity, learning, and military
abilities. Some years after the Persian defeat, Athens
was visited by a very terrible calamity, insomuch
that its ravages were like what had never been before
known. This was a plague. We now adopt the
language of Rollin. "It is related, that this scourge
began in Ethiopia, whence it descended into Egypt,
from thence spread over Libya, and a great part of
Persia; and at last broke at once like a flood upon
Athens. Thucydides, who himself was seized with that
deadly disease, has described very minutely the several
circumstances and symptoms of it; in order, says he,
that a faithful and exact relation of this calamity
may serve as an instruction to posterity, in case the
like should ever happen. This pestilence baffled the
utmost efforts of art; the most robust constitutions
were unable to withstand its attacks; and the greatest
care and skill of the physicians were a feeble help to
those who were infected. The instant a person was
seized, he was struck with despair, which quite disabled
him from attempting a cure. The assistance
that was given them was ineffectual, and proved
mortal to all such of their relations as had the courage
to approach them. The prodigious quantity of
baggage, which had been removed out of the country
into the city, proved very noxious. Most of the inhabitants,
for want of lodging, lived in little cottages,
in which they could scarcely breathe, during the
raging heat of the summer; so that they were seen
either piled one upon the other, the dead as well as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
those who were dying, or else crawling through the
streets; or lying along by the side of fountains, to
which they had dragged themselves, to quench the
raging thirst which consumed them. The very
temples were filled with dead bodies, and every part
of the city exhibited a dreadful image of death; without
the least remedy for the present, or the least
hopes with regard to futurity.</p>

<p>"The plague, before it spread into Attica, had,
as we have before stated, made wild havoc in Persia.
Artaxerxes, who had been informed of the mighty
reputation of Hippocrates of Cos, the greatest physician
of that or any other age, caused his governors
to write to him, to invite him into his dominions, in
order that he might prescribe for those who were infected.
The king made him the most advantageous
offers; setting no bounds to his rewards on the side
of interest, and, with regard to honours, promising
to make him equal with the most considerable persons
in his court. This great physician sent no other
answer but this:&mdash;that he was free from either wants
or desires; and he owed all his cares to his fellow-citizens
and countrymen; and was under no obligation
to the declared enemies of Greece.&mdash;Kings are
not used to denials. Artaxerxes, therefore, in the
highest transports of rage, sent to the city of Cos,
the native place of Hippocrates, and where he was at
that time; commanding them to deliver up to him
that insolent wretch, in order that he might be
brought to condign punishment; and threatening, in
case they refused, to lay waste their city and island
in such a manner, that not the least footsteps of it
should remain. However, the inhabitants of Cos
were not under the least terror. They made answer,
that the menaces of Darius and Xerxes had not been
able to prevail with them to give them earth and
water, or to obey their orders; that Artaxerxes'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
threats would be equally impotent; that, let what
would be the consequence, they would never give up
their fellow citizens; and that they depended upon
the protection of the gods.</p>

<p>"Hippocrates had said in one of his letters, that
he owed himself entirely to his country. And, indeed,
the instant he was sent for to Athens, he went
thither, and did not once stir out of the city till the
plague had ceased. He devoted himself entirely to
the service of the sick; and, to multiply himself, as it
were, he sent several of his disciples into all parts of
the country, after having instructed them in what
manner to treat their patients. The Athenians were
struck with the deepest sense of gratitude for this
generous care. They therefore ordained, by a public
decree, that Hippocrates should be initiated in the
most exalted mysteries, in the same manner as Hercules
the son of Jupiter; that a crown of gold should
be presented him, of the value of a thousand staters<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>,
and that the decree by which it was granted him,
should be read aloud by a herald in the public games,
on the solemn festival of Panathen&aelig;a: that the freedom
of the city should be given him, and himself be
maintained at the public charge, in the Prytaneum
all his lifetime, in case he thought proper: in fine,
that the children of all the people of Cos, whose city
had given birth to so great a man, might be maintained
and brought up in Athens, in the same manner."</p>

<p>In the time of Agis and Pausanias, kings of Lacedemonia,
Lysander was sent to besiege Athens. He
arrived, therefore, at the Pir&aelig;us, with a fleet of one
hundred and fifty sail, and prevented all other
ships from coming in or going out. The Athenians,
besieged by land and sea, without provisions, ships,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
hope of relief, or any resources, sent deputies to Agis,
to propose a treaty with Sparta, upon condition of
abandoning all their possessions, the city and port
only excepted. He referred the deputies to Lacedemon,
as not being empowered to treat with them.
When they arrived at Salasia, upon the frontier of
Sparta, and had made known their commission to
the Ephori, they were ordered to retire, and to come
with other proposals, if they expected a peace. The
Ephori had demanded, "that one thousand two
hundred paces of the wall on each side of the Pir&aelig;us
should he demolished;" but an Athenian, for venturing
to advise a compliance, was sent to prison, and prohibition
made against proposing any thing of that
kind for the future.</p>

<p>The Corinthians and several other allies, especially
the Thebans, insisted that it was absolutely necessary
to destroy the city without hearkening any further to
a treaty. But the Lacedemonians, preferring the
glory and safety of Greece to their own grandeur,
made answer, that they would never be reproached
with having destroyed a city that had rendered such
great services to all Greece; the remembrance of
which ought to have much greater weight with the
allies than the remembrance of private injuries received
from it. A peace was, therefore, concluded
under these conditions:&mdash;"that the fortifications of
the Pir&aelig;us, with the long wall that joined that port
to the city, should be demolished; that the Athenians
should deliver up all their galleys, twelve only
excepted; that they should abandon all the cities
they had seized, and content themselves with their
own lands and country." The deputies, on their return,
were surrounded by an innumerable throng of
people, who apprehended that nothing had been concluded;
for they were not able to hold out any longer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
such multitudes dying of famine. The next day
they reported the success of their negociation; the
treaty was ratified, and Lysander, followed by the
exiles, entered the port. It was on the very day the
Athenians had formerly gained the famous battle of
Salamis. He caused the works to be demolished to
the sound of flutes and trumpets, as if all Greece had
that day regained its liberty. Thus ended the Peloponnesian
war, after having continued during the
space of twenty-seven years.</p>

<p>The walls, thus demolished, were rebuilt by
Conon. He did more; he restored Athens to its
former splendour, and rendered it more formidable to
its enemies than it had ever been before.</p>

<p>Philip<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> having gained the battle of Cheron&aelig;a,
Greece, and above all, Athens, received a blow from
which she never recovered. It was generally expected,
that Philip would avail himself of this
opportunity of entirely crushing his inveterate enemy.
That prudent prince, however, foresaw that powerful
obstacles were yet to be encountered, and that
there was still a spirit in the Athenian people which
might render it difficult to hold them in subjection.
It would appear, also, says an elegant writer,
as if the genius and fame of Athens had, in the
hour of her calamity, thrown a shield over her: for
Philip is reported to have said, "Have I done so
much for glory, and shall I destroy the theatre of
that glory?" A treaty, in consequence, was entered
into; and thus the Athenians, though reluctant to
exist by Philip's clemency, were permitted to retain
the whole Attic territory.</p>

<p>The number of men able to bear arms at Athens,
in the reign of Cecrops, was computed at twenty
thousand; and there appears to have been no considerable
augmentation in the more civilised age of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Pericles; but in the time of Demetrius Phalareus,
there were found twenty-one thousand citizens, ten
thousand foreigners, and forty thousand slaves.</p>

<p>Philip<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>, son of Demetrius of Macedon, seems to
have been one of the most inveterate enemies by
whom Athens was ever ravaged. With unsparing
cruelty he destroyed almost every thing which had
either escaped the Persian invaders, or which had
been erected after their final expulsion. Livy tells
us, that, not content with burning and destroying
the temples of the gods, he ordered that the very
stones should be broken into small pieces, that they
might no longer serve to repair the buildings; and
Diodorus Siculus asserts, that even the inviolability
of the sepulchres could not command his respect, or
repress his violence.</p>

<p>Athens, however, still recovered some portion of
its power; for when Sylla arrived before the Pir&aelig;us,
he found the walls to be sixty feet high, and entirely
of hewn stone. The work was very strong, and had
been raised by order of Pericles in the Peloponnesian
war: when, the hopes of victory depending solely
upon this port, he had fortified it to the utmost of
his power.</p>

<p>The height of the walls did not deter Sylla. He
employed all sorts of engines in battering them, and
made continual assaults. He spared neither danger,
attacks, nor expense, to hasten the conclusion of the
war. Without enumerating the rest of the warlike
stores and equipage, twenty thousand mules were
perpetually employed in working the machines only.
Wood happening to fall short, from the great consumption
made of it in the machines, which were
often either broken or spoiled by the vast weight they
carried, or burned by the enemy, he did not spare
the sacred groves. He cut down the trees in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
walks of the Academy and Lyc&aelig;um, which were the
finest and best planted in the suburbs, and caused
the high walls that joined the port to the city to be
demolished, in order to make use of the ruins in
erecting his works, and carrying on his operations.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all disadvantages, the Athenians
defended themselves like lions. They found means
either to burn most of the machines erected against
the walls, or by undermining them, to throw them
down and break them to pieces. The Romans, on
their side, behaved with no less vigour. Sylla, discouraged
by so obstinate a defence, resolved to attack
the Pir&aelig;us no longer, and confined himself to reduce
the place by famine. The city was now at the last
extremity; a bushel of barley having been sold in it
for a thousand drachms (about 25<i>l.</i> sterling). In
the midst of the public misery, the governor, who
was a lieutenant of Mithridates, passed his days and
nights in debauch. The senators and priests went
to throw themselves at his feet, conjuring him to
have pity on the city, and to obtain a capitulation
from Sylla; he dispersed them with arrow-shot, and
in that manner drove them from his presence.</p>

<p>He did not demand a cessation of arms, nor send
deputies to Sylla, till reduced to the last extremity.
As those deputies made no proposals, and asked
nothing of him to the purpose, but ran on in praising
and extolling Theseus, Eumolpus, and the exploits
of the Athenians against the Medes, Sylla was tired
of their discourse, and interrupted them by saying,&mdash;"Gentlemen
haranguers, you may go back again,
and keep your rhetorical flourishes to yourselves. For
my part, I was not sent to Athens to be informed of
your ancient prowess, but to chastise your modern
revolt."</p>

<p>During this audience, some spies having entered
the city, overheard by chance some old men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
talking of the quarter called Ceramicus (the public
place at Athens), and blaming the tyrant exceedingly
for not guarding a certain part of the wall that was
the only place by which the enemy could scale the
walls. At their return into the camp, they related
what they heard to Sylla. The parley had been to
no purpose. Sylla did not neglect the intelligence
given him. The next night he went in person to
take a view of the place; and finding the wall
actually accessible, he ordered ladders to be raised
against it, began the attack there, and, having made
himself master of the wall, after a weak resistance,
entered the city. He would not suffer it to be set
on fire, but abandoned it to be plundered by his soldiers,
who, in several houses, found human flesh,
which had been dressed to be eaten. A dreadful
slaughter ensued. The next day all the slaves were
sold by auction, and liberty was granted to the
citizens who had escaped the swords of the soldiers,
who were a very small number. He besieged the
citadel the same day, where Aristion and those who
had taken refuge there, were soon so much reduced
by famine, that they were forced to surrender themselves.
The tyrant, his guards, and all who had
been in any office under him, were put to death.
Some ten days after, Sylla made himself master of
the Pi&aelig;aus, and burned all its fortifications.</p>

<p>The reputation for learning, military valour, and
polished elegance, which Athens enjoyed during the
splendid administration of Pericles, was tarnished
by the corruption which that celebrated person
introduced. Prosperity was the forerunner of luxury
and universal dissipation; every delicacy was drawn
from distant nations; the wines of Cyprus, and the
snows of Thrace, garlands of roses, perfumes, and
a thousand arts of buffoonery, which disgraced a
Persian court, were introduced; instead of the coarse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
meals, the herbs and plain bread, which the laws of
Solon had recommended, and which had nourished
the heroes of Marathon and Salamis.</p>

<p>Sylla's assault was the final termination of the
power and greatness of Athens; she became a portion
of the Roman empire; but in the reign of Hadrian
and the Antonines, she resumed, at least in outward
appearance, no small portion of her former splendour.
Hadrian built several temples, and, above all, he
finished that of Jupiter Olympius, the work of successive
kings, and one of the greatest productions of
human art. He founded, also, a splendid library;
and bestowed so many privileges, that an inscription,
placed on one of the gates, declared Athens to be no
longer the city of Theseus, but of Hadrian. In
what manner it was regarded too in the time of
Trajan, may be gathered from Pliny's letter to a
person named Maximus, who was sent thither as
governor.</p>

<p>"Remember," said he, "that you are going to
visit Achaia, the proper and true Greece; that you
are appointed to govern a state of free cities, who
have maintained liberty by their valour. Take not
away any thing of their privileges, their dignity; no,
nor yet of their presumption; but consider it is a
country that hath of long time given laws, and
received none; that it is to Athens thou goest, where
it would be thought a barbarous cruelty in thee to
deprive them of that shadow and name of liberty
which still remaineth to them."</p>

<p>The Antonines trod in the steps of Hadrian.
Under them Herodes Atticus devoted an immense
fortune to the embellishment of the city and the
promotion of learning.</p>

<p>But when the Roman world felt the wand of
adversity, and her power began to decline, Athens
felt her share; she had enjoyed a long respite from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
foreign war, but in the reign of Arcadius and Honorius
a dreadful tempest burst upon her.</p>

<p>Alaric, after over-running the rest of Greece, advanced
into Attica, and found Athens without any
power of defence. The whole country was converted
into a desert; but it seems uncertain, whether he
plundered the city, or whether he accepted the
greater part of its wealth as a ransom. Certain,
however, it is, that it suffered severely, and a contemporary
compared it to the mere skin of a slaughtered
victim.</p>

<p>It is reported that, during their stay in the city,
the barbarians, having collected all the libraries of
Athens, were preparing to burn them; but one of
their number diverted them from their design, by
suggesting the propriety of leaving to their enemies
what appeared to be the most effectual instrument
for cherishing and promoting their unwarlike spirit.</p>

<p>After the devastations of Alaric, and, still more,
after the shutting up of her schools, Athens ceased
almost entirely to attract the attention of mankind.
These schools were suppressed by an edict of Justinian;
an edict which excited great grief and indignation
among the few remaining votaries of Grecian
science and superstition. Seven friends and philosophers,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
who dissented from the religion of their
sovereign, resolved to seek in a foreign land the
freedom of which they were deprived in their native
country. Accordingly, the seven sages sought an
asylum in Persia, under the protection of Chosroes;
but, disgusted and disappointed, they hastily returned,
and declared that they had rather die on the
borders of the empire than enjoy the wealth and
favour of the barbarian. These associates ended
their lives in peace and obscurity; and as they left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
no disciples, they terminate the long list of philosophers
who may be justly praised, notwithstanding
their defects, as the wisest and most virtuous of their
times<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>.</p>

<p>After the taking of Constantinople by the Latins,
in the beginning of the thirteenth century, the
western powers began to view Greece as an object
of ambition. In the division of the Greek empire,
which they made among themselves, Greece and
Macedonia fell to the share of the Marquis of Montferrat,
who bestowed Athens and Thebes on one of
his followers, named Otho de la Roche. This prince
reigned with the title of Duke of Athens, which
remained for a considerable time<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>.</p>

<p>It was afterwards seized by a powerful Florentine
family, named Acciaioli, one of whom sold it to
the Venetians; but his son seized it again, and it
remained in that family till <small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 1455, when it
surrendered to Omar, a general of Mahomet II., and
thus formed one of the two hundred cities which that
prince took from the Christians. He settled a colony
in it, and incorporated it completely with the Turkish
empire. What has occurred of late years has not
been embodied in any authentic history; but the
consequences of the tumults of Greece may be in
some degree imagined, from what is stated by a
recent traveller in regard to Athens<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>. "When I
sallied forth to explore the wonders of Athens, alas!
they were no longer to be seen. The once proud city
of marble was literally a mass of ruins&mdash;the inglorious
ruins of mud-houses and wretched mosques
forming in all quarters such indistinguishable piles,
that in going about I was wholly unable to fix<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
upon any peculiarities of streets or buildings, by
which I might know my way from one part of the
capital to another. With the exception of the
remains of the Forum, the temple of Theseus, which
is still in excellent preservation, the celebrated columns
of the temple of Jupiter Olympius, and the
Parthenon, nothing now exists at Athens of all the
splendid edifices with which it was so profusely decorated
in the days of its glory."</p>

<p>It has been well observed, that, associated in the
youthful mind with all that is noble in patriotism,
exalted in wisdom, excelling in art, elegant in literature,
luminous in science, persuasive in eloquence,
and heroic in action, the beautiful country of Greece,
and its inhabitants, must, under every circumstance,
even of degradation, be an interesting object of study.
"We can all feel, or imagine," says Lord Byron,
"the regret with which the ruins of cities, once the
capital of empires, are beheld. But never did the
littleness of man, and the vanity of his very best
virtues, of patriotism to exalt and of valour to defend
his country, appear more conspicuous than in the
record of what Athens once was, and the certainty
of what she now is."</p>

<p>The former state of Athens is thus described by
Barthelemy. "There is not a city in Greece which
presents so vast a number of public buildings and
monuments as Athens. Edifices, venerable for their
antiquity, or admirable for their elegance, raise
their majestic heads on all sides. Masterpieces of
sculpture are extremely numerous, even in the public
places, and concur with the finest productions of the
pencil to embellish the porticoes of temples. Here
every thing speaks to the eyes of the attentive
spectator."</p>

<p>To describe Athens entire would be to fill a volume.
We shall, therefore, only give an account of the chief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
monuments of antiquity as they existed till very
lately; the rest, as they give one little or no sort of
idea of their ancient magnificence, were better omitted
than mentioned.</p>

<p>The Pir&aelig;us<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> is one of the finest ports in Greece,
and, being bounded by rocks, has experienced hardly
any change in its form or dimensions. The sea,
however, appears to have encroached a little, as
some ruins are seen under water. The general depth
of the port is from two to ten fathoms, in some places
twenty. The Pir&aelig;us was decorated with a theatre,
several temples, and a great number of statues. As
the existence of Athens depended on the safety of
this harbour, Themistocles secured it against sudden
attack by building a wall, sixty stadia in length, and
forty cubits high. As to its thickness, it was greater
than the space occupied by two waggons. It was
built of huge square stones, fastened together on the
outside by iron and leaden cramps. Without the gate
was a cenotaph, erected in honour of Euripides, on
which was inscribed "The glory of Euripides has all
Greece for a monument."</p>

<p>The old city of Athens was seated on the top of a
rock in the midst of a pleasant plain, which, as the
number of inhabitants increased, became full of buildings,
which induced the distinction of Acro and
Catapolis, <i>i. e.</i>, of the upper and lower city.</p>

<p>The inside of the citadel was adorned with a multitude
of edifices. The flat space on the rock of the
Acropolis is not more than eight hundred feet in
length, and about four hundred feet in breadth,&mdash;a
small extent for the site of the primitive city of the
Athenians; but an area of great size, when considered
as the base only of temples and marble palaces,
containing not a single structure which might not be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
denominated a masterpiece of art<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>. The most remarkable
of these were a magnificent temple of
Minerva, styled Parthenon, because that goddess was
a virgin&mdash;this the Persians destroyed, out it was
rebuilt with still greater splendour by Pericles&mdash;the
temple of Neptune and Minerva jointly; a temple
dedicated to Victory, adorned with paintings, principally
the work of Polygnotus, and constructed of
white marble. Within the citadel, also, was an
immense number of statues, erected by religion and
gratitude, on which the chisels of Myron, Phidias,
Alcamenes, and other artists of renown, seemed to
have bestowed animation. Of these statues, some were
those of famous Athenian generals; such as Pericles,
Phormio, Iphicrates, and Timotheus; and others, those
of the gods.</p>

<p>It appears surprising that so many temples should
have been crowded together within the narrow compass
of the Athenian Acropolis; but the Roman
Capitol, though not much more spacious, contained
at least thirty temples<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>.</p>

<p>"In its pride and glory," says Chandler, "the
Acropolis appeared as one entire offering to the deity,
surpassing in excellence, and astonishing in richness.
Heliodorus employed on it fifteen books. The
curiosities of various kinds, with the pictures, statues,
and pieces of sculpture, were so many and so
remarkable, as to supply Polemo Periegetes with
matter for four volumes; and Strabo affirms, that as
many more would be required in treating of Athens
and of Attica.</p>

<p>As the stranger draws near to the present entrance
of the citadel, he passes before the fa&ccedil;ade of the
Propylea; the old entrance to the Acropolis, between
its Doric pillars, being walled up. Pausanias says,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
"There is only one entrance to the Acropolis of
Athens; it being in every remaining part of its circuit
a precipice, and fortified by strong walls. This
entrance was fronted by a magnificent building,
called the Propylea, covered with roofs of white
marble, which surpassed, for beauty and the dimensions
of the marble, all that I have seen." This is
now in ruins.</p>

<p>This was the most expensive work undertaken
by Pericles, and is said to have cost 2,500 talents
(&pound;452,700). It took five years in building, and was
completed <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 437.</p>

<p>"To a person who has seen the ruins of Rome,"
says Dr. Clarke, "the first suggestion, made by a
sight of the buildings in the Acropolis, is that of the
infinite superiority of the Athenian architecture. It
possesses the greatness and majesty of the Egyptian
or of the ancient Etruscan style, with all the elegant
proportion, the rich ornaments, and the discriminating
taste of the most splendid era of the arts." Its
present condition is thus described by Mr. Williams.
"The scene of desolation in the Acropolis is
complete; the heaps of ruins of wretched houses, and
various buildings, are constructed part with clay and
marble, the marble looking doleful through the mud.
On entering the temple one is struck by the worn
steps, and curved or circular marks of the great
doors of old; the pavement, too, that had been
trodden by the luminaries of Greece."</p>

<p>The walls of the Acropolis<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> exhibit three distinct
periods of construction; that is to say, the masonry
of <i>modern</i> times in the repairs,&mdash;a style of building
which can only be referred to the age of <i>Cimon</i>, or
of <i>Pericles</i>;&mdash;and the ancient <i>Pelasgic</i> work, as
mentioned by Lucian.  The <i>modern</i> walls of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
city are about ten feet high, and not two in thickness.
They were constructed about the year 1780,
as a defence against pirates and hordes of Arnauts,
who sometimes entered the town at night, and
threatened to pillage it. The walls embrace a circuit
of nearly three miles, and enclose not only the
town and citadel, but also some open spaces for cattle.
They were built in seventy-five days, all hands
being employed night and day. All kinds of materials
which were at hand were employed in their
construction, and in some places they exhibit large
blocks of stone and marble, and several fragmental
inscriptions<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>.</p>

<p>The lower city had thirteen gates, and among
the principal edifices which adorned it were, 1. The
Olympian temple, erected in honour of Athens and
all Greece. 2. The Pantheon, dedicated to all the
gods; a noble structure, supported by one hundred
and twenty marble pillars, and having over its great
gateway two horses, carved by Praxiteles. 3. The
temple of Theseus; a noble structure, of Pentelic
marble.</p>

<p>The Gymnasia of Athens were many, but the most
remarkable were the Lyceum, Academia, and Cynosarges.
The Lyceum stood on the banks of the
Ilissus; some say it was built by Pisistratus; others
by Pericles; others by Lycurgus.</p>

<p>The Academy was so called from Academus. The
Cynosarges was a place in the suburbs, not far from
the Lyceum.</p>

<p>The Areopagus is situated a few hundred feet west
of the Acropolis. It consists of an insulated rock,
precipitous, and broken towards the south; on the
north side it slopes gently down towards the temple
of Theseus, and is rather lower than the Acropolis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
"Higher up, ascending a hill covered with thistles
and red pebbles, you arrive," says M. La Martine,
"at the Pnyx; the scene of the stormy assemblies
of the people of Athens, and of the fluctuating triumphs
of its orators or its favourites; enormous
masses of black stone, some of which measure twelve
or thirteen cubic feet, lie upon one another, and support
the terrace, upon which the people collected.
Still higher up, at the distance of about fifty paces,
we perceive a huge square block, wherein steps have
been cut, which probably served for the orator to
mount his tribunal, which thus overlooked the
people, the city, and the sea. This possesses not the
character of the people of Pericles, but seems Roman.
The recollections it inspires are, however, delightful.
Demosthenes spoke from thence, and roused or
calmed that popular sea, more stormy than the &AElig;gean,
which he could also hear roll behind him."</p>

<p>"From the odeum of Regilla," says Dr. Clarke,
"we went to the Areopagus, wishing to place our feet
upon a spot where it is so decidedly known that St.
Paul had himself stood; and to view with our own eyes
the same scene which he beheld, when he declared
unto the Athenians the nature of the <span class="smcap">unknown god</span>,
whom they so ignorantly worshipped. * * * We
ascended to the top by means of steps cut within the
natural stone, which is of breccia. The sublime
scene here exhibited is so striking, that a brief description
of it may prove how truly it offers to us a
commentary upon St. Paul's words, as they were
delivered upon the spot. Before him there was
spread a glorious prospect of mountains, islands,
seas, and skies; behind him towered the lofty Acropolis,
crowned with all its marble temples. This
very object, whether in the face of nature, or among
the works of art, conspired to elevate the mind, and
to fill it with reverence towards that <span class="smcap">Being</span>, 'who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
made and governs the world;' who sitteth in that
light which no mortal eye can approach, and yet is
nigh unto the meanest of his creatures; 'in whom
we live, and move, and have our being.'"</p>

<p>Near the Pir&aelig;an gate is still to be seen, in a state
of admirable preservation, the ground-plot and entire
town of the Pnyx, or place of <i>parliament</i> of the
Athenians, as it was appropriated by Solon to the
use of the citizens. Nearly the whole of it is an excavation
of the rock, and the several parts of it were
carved in stone of one solid mass, with the exception
only of the semi-circular area, the farthest part
of which consists of masonry. "To approach the
spot," says Dr. Clarke, "once dignified by the presence
of the greatest Grecian orators, to set our feet
where they stood, and actually to behold the place
where Demosthenes addressed 'the men of Athens,'
calling to mind the most memorable examples of his
eloquence, is a gratification of an exalted nature. But
the feelings excited in viewing the Pnyx, peculiarly
affect Englishmen: that holy fire, so much dreaded
by the Athenian tyrants, and which this place had
such a remarkable tendency to agitate, burns yet in
Britain; it is the very soul of her liberties, and it
strengthens the security of her laws; giving eloquence
to her senate, heroism to her armies, extension to her
commerce, and freedom to her people: although annihilated
in almost every country of the earth, it
lives in England, and its extinction there, like the
going out of the sacred flame in the temple of Delphi,
would be felt as a national calamity."</p>

<p>Among the loose fragments, dispersed in the Acropolis,
has been found a small piece of marble, with
an inscription, but in so imperfect a state, that Dr.
Clarke considered it only worth notice as a memorial
of the place where it was found, and in its allusion to
the Prytaneum, which is the only legible part of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>The Prytaneum, where the written laws of Solon
were kept, however, was not in the Acropolis, but
in a lower part of the city. The Gymnasium of
Ptolemy, which stands near the temple of Theseus, is
greatly dilapidated, and, in no small degree, concealed
by dwellings<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>. The Erectheum is situated
about one hundred and fifty feet to the north of the
Parthenon. This structure consisted of two contiguous
temples; that of Minerva Polias, with its portico
towards the east; and that of Pandrosus towards
the west, with its two porticoes standing by the north
and south angles, the entrance to the Pandroseum
being on the northern side. The Turks made a
powder-magazine of one of the vestibules of this
building, which contains one of the finest specimens
of Ionian architecture now existing; and it has been
judiciously remarked of the sculpture, every where
displayed in this edifice, that it is difficult to conceive
how marble has been wrought to such a depth, and
brought to so sharp an edge, the ornaments having
all the delicacy of works of metal.</p>

<p>In that portion of the Erectheum which was dedicated
to Minerva Polias, the columns of the front
porch are standing, but without any part of their
entablature. The marble<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> of this ruin is of virgin
whiteness; and the workmanship, as the structure is
very diminutive in comparison with the specimens of
the Parthenon, is a still more exquisite example than
that temple, of the polish and edge which were
given to all the parts of Grecian architecture. The
line of no pencil can excel the delicate accuracy of
contour in the swell of the torus, and the ornaments
of the base; and the hand, in passing repeatedly over
the marble, seeks in vain for the slightest inequality
or even roughness on the surface.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>A bluish-grey limestone<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> seems to have been used
in some of the works; particularly in the exquisite
ornaments of the Erectheum, where the frieze of the
temple and of its porticoes are not of marble like the
rest of the building, but of this sort of slate-limestone.
This resembles the limestone employed in the
walls of the cella at the temple of Ceres, at Eleusis,
and in buildings before the use of marble was known
for purposes of architecture: such, for example, is
the sort of stone employed in the temple of Apollo
at Phigalia, and in other edifices of equal antiquity;
it effervesces briskly in acids, and has all the properties
of common compact lime, except that it is hard
enough to cut glass, and, of course, is susceptible of a
fine polish, exhibiting a flat conchoidal fracture,
which is somewhat splintery. We could not discover
a single fragment of porphyry; which was remarkable,
as this substance was almost always used by
the ancients in works of great magnificence.</p>

<p>The temple of <span class="smcap">Anchesmian Jupiter</span> stood upon
a commanding eminence. The pagan shrine has
been succeeded by a small Christian sanctuary. Of
the scene from the top of this steep and craggy rock,
Wheler speaks in a style of enthusiasm, rather unfrequent
with him:&mdash;"I wish I could make you
taste the same satisfaction, while I describe the prospect,
that I then did, and still do, when I consider it.
Here, either a Democritus might sit and laugh at
the pomps and vanities of the world, whose glories
so soon vanish; or a Heraclitus weep over the manifold
misfortunes of it, telling sad stories of the
various changes and events of life. This would have
been a place to inspire a poet, as the brave actions, performed
within his view, have already exercised the
pens of great historians. Here, like Virgil, he might
have sate, and interwoven beautiful descriptions of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the rivers, mountains, woods of olives, and groves of
lemons and oranges, with the celebrated harbours on
the shores and islands, all lying before him, as on a
map, which I was content to do only in contemplation;
and with a sea-compass to mark out the most
considerable places on paper."</p>

<p>The Odeum of Regilla stands at the foot of the
rock of the Acropolis. The remains of this edifice
are those which Wheler and all former travellers,
excepting Chandler, have described as the theatre of
Bacchus<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. Of the <i>theatre</i> of <i>Bacchus</i>, nothing
remains except the circular sweep for the seats; as in
the earliest ages of dramatic representation, it was
universally formed by scooping the sloping side of
a rock<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>. The<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> passion of the Athenians for the
theatre is not conceivable. Their eyes, their ears,
their imagination, their understanding, all shared in
the satisfaction: nothing gave them so sensible a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
pleasure in dramatic performances, either tragic or
comic, as the strokes which were aimed at the affairs
of the public, whether some chance occasioned the
application, or the address of the poets, who knew
how to reconcile the most remote subjects with the
transactions of the republic. They entered by this
means into the interests of the people, took occasion
to soothe their passions, authorise their pretensions,
justify, and sometimes condemn their conduct, entertain
them with agreeable hopes, instruct them in
their duty in certain nice conjunctures; in effecting
which they often not only acquired the applauses of
the spectators, but credit and influence in the public
affairs and councils: hence the theatre became so
grateful, and so much the concern of the people<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>The temple, dedicated to Augustus, consists of
four Doric pillars of white marble, fluted, and, like
those of all the other buildings of this order, without
plinths or bases; they still support their architrave
with the pontoon, on the top of which is a square
piece of marble, seeming to have been placed there
as the pedestal to some statue. There seems, also,
to be some inscription on it, but by reason of the
height, unintelligible. It is impossible to give
a plan of the whole; the remains of it affording
but little light towards discovering what form it
was of.</p>

<p>Of the remains of the Stadium Panathenaicum, the
most wonderful of all the works of Herodes Atticus:&mdash;"It
has been usual to say of this," says Dr. Edward
Clarke, "that nothing now remains of its former
magnificence. To our eyes, every thing necessary to
impress the mind with an accurate idea of the object
itself, and of its grandeur, and of the prodigious
nature of the work, seemed to exist, as if it had been
in its perfect state. The marble covering of the
seats, indeed, no longer appears; but the lines are
visible of the different ranges; and perhaps a part
of the covering itself might be brought to light by a
removal of the soil."</p>

<p>This memorial of Attic splendour, and of the
renown of a private citizen of Athens, became ultimately
his funeral monument; and a very curious
discovery may be reserved for future travellers in the
majestic sepulchre of Herodes himself, who was here
interred with the highest obsequies and most distinguished
honours a grateful people could possibly
bestow upon the tomb of a benefactor, who spared no
expense for them while he was living, and every
indi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>vidual of whom participated in his bounty<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> at his
death<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.</p>

<p>Beneath the arch of Hadrian persons are conducted
from the old city of Theseus to the new Athens, built
by Hadrian. The stones are put together without
cement; but the work is adorned with a row of
Corinthian pilasters and columns, with bases supporting
an upper tier in the same style of architecture.
It was erected commemorative of Hadrian's return
to Athens. A new city had arisen under his
auspices. Magnificent temples, stately shrines, unsullied
altars, awaited the benediction of this sacerdotal
monarch; and it would, indeed, have been marvellous
if the Athenians, naturally prone to adulation,
neglected to bestow it on a benefactor so well disposed
for its reception. The triumphal arch was of
course prepared, and lasting characters thereon inscribed
have proclaimed to succeeding ages, that
"The Athens of Hadrian eclipsed the city of Theseus<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>."</p>

<p>Besides this arch, there are other remnants of
structures erected in honour of Hadrian. Of these
are the stupendous pillars which bear his name. In
the time of Pausanias, there were one hundred and
twenty pillars of Phrygian marble. Of these, sixteen
columns of white marble, each six feet in diameter,
and sixty feet in height, now remain; all of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Corinthian order, beautifully fluted, and of the most
exquisite workmanship. "Certainly," says Wheler,
"this was a work alone that may justify the liberality
of Hadrian, and the great care he took to adorn the
city; for this must needs have been a wonderful portico,
both for beauty, use, and grandeur." Pausanias
says, that it was enclosed with a cloister, in which
were built rooms of the same stone, only the roofs
of alabaster, gilded with gold, and the whole excellently
adorned with statues and pictures. He founded
also a library and a gymnasium.</p>

<p>The Tower or Temple of the Winds<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> is more attractive
by its singularity than its beauty. It was
the water-clock, the chronometer, and the weather
guide of Athens. It was built by Andronicus
Cyrrhestes<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>. On the top stood a brazen Triton, contrived
so as to turn round with the wind, and with a
wand, that he held in his hand, to point to the figure of
the wind which blew. The Triton is now wanting;
the rest remains entire. It is a small octagon tower;
the roof is built pyramidically. On every side is
represented the figure of a wind, with proper attributes,
characterising the nature of it, in very good
<i>basso rilievo</i>, and their names written above them in
Greek characters. The god Zephyrus is represented
as a beautiful young man, gliding gently along with
an imperceptible motion, with his bosom full of
flowers. They are all drawn with wings, and flying
on with more or less rapidity, according to the violence
of each wind in those parts. This structure
is known to be the same which Vitruvius mentions,
but it is entirely unnoticed by Pausanias<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>. Some
suppose that it was one of the sacred structures of
the ancient city, and that, as a place of religious
worship, it answered other purposes than that of
merely indicating the direction of the winds, the
seasons, and the hours.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>As Dr. Clarke drew near to the walls, he beheld
the vast Cecropian citadel, crowned with temples,
that originated in the veneration, once paid to the
memory of the illustrious dead, surrounded by objects,
telling the same theme of sepulchral grandeur,
and now monuments of departed greatness, mouldering
in all the solemnity of ruin. "So paramount is
this funereal character in the approach to Athens
from the Pir&aelig;us," says he, "that as we passed the
hill of the Museum, which was, in fact, an ancient
cemetery of the Athenians, we might have imagined
ourselves to be among the tombs of Telmessus, from
the number of sepulchres hewn in the rock, and
from the antiquity of the workmanship, evidently
not of later date than any thing of the kind in Asia
Minor. In other respects, the city exhibits nearly
the appearance so briefly described by Strabo,
eighteen centuries before our coming; and perhaps it
wears a more magnificent aspect, owing to the splendid
remains of Hadrian's temple of Olympian Jove,
which did not exist when Athens was visited by the
disciple of Xenacchus."</p>

<p>"The first monument," says La Martine, "which
attracts your attention, is the temple of Olympian
Jupiter, the magnificent columns of which rise alone
upon a deserted naked spot, on the right of what
was Athens&mdash;a worthy portico of a city in ruins."
This temple<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> was pretended by the Athenians to
have been originally founded in the time of Deucalion,
and to have subsisted nine hundred years; but
in the end falling into ruin, it began to be rebuilt by
Pisistratus, and having received additions from
several hands during the space of seven hundred
years, was completely finished by the Emperor Hadrian,
and dedicated to Jupiter Olympus, to whose
honour the same prince erected a colossal statue of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
immense value, both on account of the richness of its
materials and the beauty of its workmanship. Nothing
in all Greece, nor even in the whole world, was
equal to the magnificence of this temple. Its area
was computed to be four stadia. The inside was
embellished with statues by the best hands, placed
between each column, which were gifts from all the
cities of Greece, that were desirous of paying their
court to the Emperor; among whom the Athenians
distinguished themselves by the colossus, erected by
them in honour of the monarch himself. It is impossible
from the remains to collect the plan of the
whole building; there being nothing left but ten
beautiful Corinthian pillars, with their friezes, architraves,
and cornices, two fluted, the remaining
eight plain. Close behind the eight, which stand in
one rank, is a wall of white marble, the same as the
columns, and, at the south end, the two that project,
being fluted, and on a different line from the others,
seem to have formed the entrance of the temple<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>.</p>

<p>The solitary grandeur of these marble ruins<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> is,
perhaps, more striking than the appearance presented
by any other object at Athens; insomuch that
the Turks themselves seem to regard them with an
eye of respect and admiration; large parties of them
being frequently seen seated on their carpets, in the
long shade of the columns. "Rome," says Chandler,
"afforded no example of this species of building. It
was one of the four marble edifices, which had raised
to the pinnacle of renown the architects who planned
them; men, it is said, admired in the assembly of
the gods for their wisdom and excellence."</p>

<p>Of this temple seventeen columns were standing in
1676; but, a few years before Chandler arrived at
Athens, one was thrown down, for the purpose of
building a new mosque in the market-place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the columns still support their architraves,
as we have before stated, one of which was found to
equal three feet in width, and although of one entire
piece of marble, it extended in length twenty-two
feet six inches. On the top of the entablature is
shown the dwelling of a hermit, who fixed his abode
upon this eminence, and dedicated his life entirely to
the contemplation of the sublime objects by which
his residence was on all sides surrounded.</p>

<p>The beauty of the temple of Theseus<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> is not at all
prejudiced by its littleness; but still remains a masterpiece
of architecture, not easy to be paralleled, much
less exceeded. Much of the history of Theseus is
expressed in relievo, on the pronaos of the front and
west end, where all the tricks and art of wrestling
seem well expressed. There are, also, some in
women's habits, to express the war of the Amazons.</p>

<p>This elegant building<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> is supposed to have furnished
the model of the Parthenon, which resembles
it in the most essential points, though it is nearly of
double the size. Indeed, the Theseion impresses the
beholder more by its symmetry than its magnitude.
It is now converted into a Christian church.
"On approaching the temple of Theseus," says La
Martine, "though convinced by what I had read
of its beauty, I was astonished to find myself quite
unmoved; my heart sought to bestir itself; my eye
sought to admire; but in vain. I felt what one
always feels at the sight of a work without faults,&mdash;a
negative pleasure,&mdash;but as to a real, strong impression,
a sense of powerful or involuntary delight, I
experienced nothing. This temple is too small; it is
a kind of sublime plaything of art. It is not a monument
for the gods; nor even for men for ages. I felt
but one instant of ecstacy, and that was when, seated
at the western angle of the temple, on its last steps,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
my eye embraced, at one glance, the magnificent
harmony of its forms, the majestic elegance of its
columns, the empty and more sombre space of its
portico; and on its internal frieze, the combats of the
Centaurs and the Lapith&aelig;; and above, through the
opening of the centre, the blue and resplendent sky,
shedding a serene and mystical light on the cornices
and the projecting slopes of the bassi-rilievi, which
seem to live and to move." All this seems rather
extraordinary.</p>

<p>"On your way from Pir&aelig;um to the city of Athens,"
says Lord Sandwich, "you pass all along the ruins
of Themistocles' wall. The road is in the middle of
a beautiful plain, covered with vineyards and olive
trees, which, being bounded on one side by mountains,
and on the other by the sea, affords a most
delightful prospect. Before your entrance into the
city, the first monument of antiquity that presents
itself to your view, is the temple of Theseus, built
by the Athenians, in honour of that hero, soon after
the battle of Marathon. This temple was allowed
the privilege of being a sanctuary for all fugitives, in
memory that Theseus, in his lifetime, protected the
distressed. It cannot be too much commended, both
on account of the beauty of the materials and regularity
of the architecture; besides which, it has the
advantage of being in a manner entire, there being
nothing wanting to it but a small part of the roof."</p>

<p>In spite of its beauty, what says Monsieur La
Martine? "No; the temple of Theseus is not worthy
of its fame; it cannot be said to live as a monument.
It is not suggestive of what it ought to be.
It is beautiful, no doubt; but it is a kind of frigid,
dead beauty, of which the artist alone ought to go
and shake the shroud, and wipe the dust. As for
me, I admired unquestionably; but quitted it without
any desire to see it again. The beautiful stones of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
the columns of the Vatican, the majestic colossal
shadows of St. Peters at Rome, never suffered me to
leave them without regret, or the hope of return."
Can all this be real? or is it merely an affectation?</p>

<p>"During our residence of ten weeks," says Sir
John Hobhouse, "there was not, I believe, a day of
which we did not devote a part to the contemplation
of the noble monuments of Grecian genius, that have
outlived the ravages of time, and the outrage of barbarous
and antiquarian despoilers. The temple of
Theseus, which was within five minutes' walk of our
lodgings, is the most perfect ancient edifice in the
world. In this fabric, the most enduring stability,
and a simplicity of design peculiarly striking, are
united with the highest elegance and accuracy of
workmanship, the characteristics of the Doric style;
whose chaste beauty is not, in the opinion of the first
artists, to be equalled by the graces of any of the

<p>"That the Theseion was originally a tomb," says
Dr. Clarke, "like other Grecian temples, is scarcely
to be doubted. The building is believed to bear date
from the event mentioned by Plutarch, when, after
the conquest of Scyros, the son of Miltiades arrived
in Athens, bearing the mouldering bones and weapons
he had discovered. This occurred during the archonship
of Apsepion; so that the Theseion has now
braved the attacks of time, of earthquakes, and of
barbarians, during a lapse of considerably above two
thousand years."</p>

<p>This beautiful Doric temple<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>, more resembling in
the style of its architecture the temples of P&aelig;stum,
than that of Minerva in the Acropolis, and the most
entire of any of the structures of ancient Greece,
were it not for the damage which the sculpture has
sustained, may be considered as still perfect. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
ruined state of the metopes and frieze has proved a
very fortunate circumstance; for it was owing solely
to this that the building escaped the ravages which
were going on in the Parthenon. The entire edifice
is of Pentelican marble. It stands east and west,
the principal front facing the east; and it is that kind
of building which was called by ancient architects,
as it is expressed in the language of Vitruvius and
explained by Stuart, a Peripteros; that is to say, it
has a portico of six columns in each front, and on
each side a range of eleven columns, exclusive of the
columns on the angles. All these columns remain in
their original position, excepting two, that separated
the portico from the pronaos, which have been demolished.
Like all pillars raised according to the most
<i>ancient</i> Doric style of buildings, they are without
bases or pedestals; standing with inexpressible dignity
and simplicity upon the pavement of the covered
walk around the cell of the temple. Some of the
metopes represent the labours of Hercules; others
the exploits of Theseus; and there are some which
were never adorned with any sculpture. Above the
ant&aelig; of the pronaos is a sculptured frieze, the subject
of which cannot now be determined; and the battle
of the Centaurs and Lapith&aelig; is represented upon a
similar frieze of the porticoes. In the tympanum of
the pediment, over the eastern front, Stuart observed
several holes in the marble, where metal cramps had
been fixed for sustaining sculpture in entire relief, as
over the eastern entrance to the Parthenon. The
action of the atmosphere in this fine climate upon the
marble has diffused over the whole edifice, as over
the buildings in the Acropolis, a warm ochreous tint,
which is peculiar to the ruins of Athens. It bears
no resemblance to the black and dingy hue, which is
acquired by all works in stone and marble, when
they have been exposed to the open air in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
more northern countries of Europe, and especially in
England. Perhaps to this warm colour, so remarkably
characterizing the remains of ancient buildings
at Athens, Plutarch alluded in that beautiful passage,
cited by Chandler, when he affirmed that the
structures of Pericles possessed a peculiar and unparalleled
excellence of character. "A certain freshness
bloomed upon them," says he, "and preserved
their faces uninjured, as if they possessed a never-fading
spirit, and had a soul insensible to age."</p>

<p>The monument of <span class="smcap">Thrasyllus</span>,&mdash;an elegant little
fabric,&mdash;was erected 318 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> It is a structure of
Pentelic marble, simple, yet highly finished. Its
entire height is twenty-nine feet five inches.</p>

<p>"How majestic, and how perfect in its preservation,"
says Dr. Clarke, "rises the Choragic monument
of Thrasyllus; and how sublime the whole
group of objects with which it is associated. At
the time of our visit, and before the work of dilapidation
had commenced, the ancient sun-dial, the
statue of the god, the pillars for the tripods, the
majestic citadel;&mdash;the last of these has, indeed, defied
the desolating ravages of barbaric power; but
who shall again behold the other objects in this affecting
scene as they then appeared? or in what distant
country and obscure retreat may we look for
their mutilated fragments?"</p>

<p>The monument of <span class="smcap">Philopappus</span><a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> stands upon the
hill of Mus&aelig;us, where that celebrated poet is said to
have been buried. It is within the walls of the
ancient city, though at some distance from those of
the modern one; and the view from it of the citadel
of Athens and the neighbouring territories is very
striking; for, looking towards the sea, the eye commands
the ports of the Pir&aelig;us, Munychia, and Phalerus;
the isles of Salamis and &AElig;gina, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
mountains of Peloponnesus, as far as the gulf of
Argos. It originally consisted of three compartments
between four Corinthian pilasters; that is to
say, of an arched recess, containing a central sitting
figure, having a square niche on each side of it.
Below these appeared three superb sculptures in
relief. That in the centre, beneath the sitting statue,
exhibits Trajan in a car, drawn by four horses, as he
is represented on many monuments of that emperor.
On either side, in square compartments, were seen
the attendants, preceding and following the triumphal
car.</p>

<p>Philopappus' monument, says Mr. Dodwell, has
its faults and deficiencies; but it is an elegant and
imposing object. In the interior of the basement
are some blocks of the grey Hymettian marble, and
the soft stone from the Pir&aelig;us. The superstructure
is of Pentelic marble.</p>

<p>It is a structure of white marble, says another
writer, built a proportionable height, something circular.
In the middle was a large niche, with a
figure of marble sitting in it, and under his feet, in
large letters,&mdash;"Philopappus, son of Epiphanes of
Besa." Wheler found a still longer inscription, in
Latin, which he thus translates:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Caius, Julius, Philopappus, son of Caius, of the
tribe of Fabia, Consul, Frater Arvalis, chosen among
the Pr&aelig;tors by the most good and august Emperor
C&aelig;sar, Nerva, Trajanus, who conquered the Germans
and Dacians.</i></p>

<p>Among the inscriptions in this city may be noted
one on a large marble stone, standing on end, in the
wall of a private house, relating to the sale of oil;
and as it teaches many things we shall cite it, as
translated by Wheler:&mdash;</p>

of transportation, or concerning the country, their
freight shall be confiscated; still those possessing the
lands of the proconsul excepted if they bring their

and, then he proceeds again:&mdash;) "'Let him retain the
half. But if he doth not receive half, let the public
take half. * * * And let the merchant write what
he hath transported, and how much of every body.
But if he shall be apprehended not to have given his
account, let him be stopped; or if he sail away, let

by hoisting sails, let them write to his country, or to

the senate the next day; but if the matter
shall exceed fifty amphor&aelig;, let it be brought to the
congregation, and half given to the discoverer. But
if any one shall yet appeal to me or my proconsuls,
let the commons choose syndics, that all things
which are done against evil doers may be executed
without reproof.'" Some lines more yet remain,
which are less preserved.</p>

<p>The majority of the Athenian churches<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
built upon the ruins of ancient temples, and are composed
of blocks of stone and marble, with a great
number of inscriptions, altars, pedestals, and architectural
ornaments. "As we passed through the
town," says Dr. Clarke, "there was hardly a house,
that had not some little marble fragments of ancient
sculpture stuck in its front, over its door."</p>

<p>At Athens four ancient buildings<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> have been entirely
destroyed within these few years; a small
Ionic temple in the Acropolis; another temple, supposed
to be of Ceres, near the Ilissus, or bridge over
that stream, and the aqueduct of Antoninus Pius.
Part also of the propyl&aelig;an columns have been
thrown down, with a mass of the architrave on the
western front of the Erectheion, and one of the
columns of the Olympeion. In fact, more than
forty of the temples and public buildings<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>, which are
mentioned by Pausanias, have so totally disappeared,
as not to leave a trace, by which it is possible to
identify their situation: and this leads us to the Parthenon,
which we have purposely left to the last, because
the wrong done to it of late years, by a nobleman
of Scotland, has been the means of introducing
to our own country a taste for the elegant and
beautiful, which it never enjoyed before.</p>

<p>"The Parthenon," says Mr. Dodwell, "at first
sight rather disappointed my expectations, and appeared
less than its fame. The eye, however, soon
becomes filled with the magnitude of its dimensions,
the beauty of its materials, the exquisite perfection
of its symmetry, and the harmonious analogy of its
proportions. It is the most unrivalled triumph of
sculpture and architecture that the world ever saw.
The delight which it inspires on a superficial view is
heightened in proportion as it is attentively surveyed.
If we admire the whole of the glorious fabric,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
that admiration will be augmented by a minute investigation
of all the ramified details. Every part
has been finished with such exquisite purity, that
not the smallest instance of negligence can be discovered
in the execution of those particulars, which
are the least exposed to observation: the most concealed
minuti&aelig; of the structure having been perfected,
with a sort of pious scrupulosity."</p>

<p>"I pass delicious hours," says M. La Martine,
"recumbent beneath the shade of the Propyl&aelig;a:
my eyes fixed on the falling pediment of the Parthenon,
I feel all antiquity in what it has produced
of divine; the rest is not worth the language
that has described it. The aspect of the Parthenon
displays, better than history, the colossal grandeur
of a people. Pericles ought not to die. What superhuman
civilization was that which supplied a
great man to command, an architect to conceive, a
sculptor to decorate, statuaries to execute, workmen
to cut, a people to pay, and eyes to comprehend and
admire such an edifice! Where shall we find such
a people, or such a period? No where!"</p>

<p>"Let us, in idea, rebuild the Parthenon," continues
the same writer; "it is easily done; it has only
lost its frieze, and its internal compartments. The
external walls, chiselled by Phidias, the columns, and
fragments of columns, remain. The Parthenon was
entirely built of Pentelic marble, so called from the
neighbouring mountain of that name, whence it was
taken. It consists of a parallelogram, surrounded by
a peristyle of forty-six Doric columns; one column
is six feet in diameter at the base, and thirty-four
feet high. The columns are placed on the pavement
of the temple itself, and have no bases. At each
extremity of the temple exists, or did exist, a portico
of six columns. The total length of the edifice is
two hundred and twenty-eight feet; its width,
two hundred feet; its height, sixty-six feet.  It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
only presents to the eye the majestic simplicity of
its architectural lines. It was, in fact, one single
idea expressed in stone, and intelligible at a glance,
like the thoughts of the ancients."</p>

<p>This recalls to our recollection what Plutarch says
in respect to Pericles. "The Parthenon was constructed
with such admirable judgment, such solidity
of workmanship, and such a profound knowledge
of the architectural art, that it would have
indefinitely defied the ravages of time, if they had not
been assisted by the operations of external violence.
It is an edifice that seems to have been constructed
for eternity. The structures which Pericles raised
are the more admirable, as, being completed in so
short a time, they yet had such a lasting beauty; for,
as they had, when new, the venerable aspect of antiquity,
so, now they are old, they have the freshness
of a modern work. They seem to be preserved from
the injuries of time by a kind of vital principle,
which produces a vigour that cannot be impaired,
and a bloom that will never fade."</p>

<p>These words of Plutarch were applicable to the
Parthenon little more than a century ago, and would
still have been so, if it had not found enemies in the
successive bigotry of contending religions, in the
destruction of war, and the plundering mania of
artists and amateurs. The high preservation of
those parts, which are still suffered to remain, is truly
astonishing! The columns are so little broken, that
were it not for the venerable reality of age, they
would almost appear of recent construction.</p>

<p>These observations naturally carry us back to the
period in which the Parthenon was built. That
which was the chief delight of the Athenians, and the
wonder of strangers, was the magnificence of their
edifices; yet no part of the conduct of Pericles moved
the spleen of his adversaries more than this. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
insisted that he had brought the greatest disgrace
upon the Athenians, by removing the treasures of
Greece from Delos, and taking them into his own
custody; that he had not left himself even the specious
apology of having caused the money to be
brought to Athens for its greater security, and to
keep it from being seized by the Barbarians; that
Greece would consider such an attempt as a manifest
tyranny; that the sums they had received from them,
upon pretence of their being employed in the war,
were laid out by the Athenians in gilding and embellishing
their city, in making magnificent statues,
and raising temples that cost millions. Nor did
they amplify in the matter; for the Parthenon alone
cost &pound;145,000. Pericles,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> on the contrary, remonstrated
to the Athenians, that they were not obliged
to give the allies an account of the money they had
received; that it was enough they defended them
from the Barbarians, whilst the allies furnished neither
soldiers, horses, nor ships. He added, that as
the Athenians were sufficiently provided with all
things necessary for war, it was but just that they
should employ the rest of their riches in edifices and
other works, which, when finished, would give immortal
glory to their city, and the whole time they
were carrying on give bread to an infinite number
of citizens: that they themselves had all kinds of
materials, as timber, stone, brass, ivory, gold, ebony,
and cypress wood; and all sorts of artificers capable
of working them, as carpenters, masons, smiths,
stone-cutters, dyers, goldsmiths; artificers in ebony,
painters, embroiderers, and turners; men fit to conduct
their naval affairs, as merchants, sailors, and
experienced pilots; others for land carriage, as cartwrights,
waggoners, carters, rope-makers, paviors,
&amp;c. &amp;c.: that it was for the advantage of the state<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
to employ these different artificers and workmen,
who, as so many separate bodies, formed, when
united, a kind of peaceable and domestic army, whose
different functions and employments diffused gain
and increase throughout all ages and sexes: lastly,
that, whilst men of robust bodies, and of an age fit
to bear arms, whether soldiers or mariners, and those
who were in the different garrisons, were supported
with the public moneys, it was but just that the rest
of the people who lived in the city should also be
maintained in their way: and that as all were members
of the same republic, they should all reap the
same advantages, by doing it services, which, though
of a different kind, did, however, all contribute to its
security or ornament. One day as the debaters were
growing warm, Pericles offered to defray the expense
of all these things, provided it should be declared in
the public inscriptions, that he only had been at the
charge of them. At these words, the people, either
admiring his magnanimity, or fired with emulation,
and determined not to let him engross that glory,
cried, with one voice, that he might take out of the
public treasury all the sums that were necessary for
his purpose.</p>

<p>Historians expatiate greatly on the magnificent
edifices and other works; but it is not easy to say
whether the complaints and murmurs raised against
him were ill-founded or not. According to Cicero,
such edifices and other works only are worthy of
admiration as are of use to the public, as aqueducts,
city walls, citadels, arsenals, sea-ports; and to these
must be added the work, made by Pericles, to join
Athens to the port of Pir&aelig;us.</p>

<p>Mons. de La Martine speaks of the only two figures
that now adorn the Parthenon thus:&mdash;"At the
Parthenon there remain only the two figures of
Mars and Venus, half crushed by two enormous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
fragments of cornice, which have glided over their
heads; but these two figures are to me worth more
than all I have seen in sculpture in my life. They
live as no other canvas or marble has ever lived.
One feels that the chisel of Phidias trembled, burned
in his hand, when these sublime figures started into
being under his fingers."</p>

<p>The following observations in regard to colour are
by Mr. Williams:&mdash;"The Parthenon, in its present
corroded state, impresses the mind with the idea of
its thousands of years. The purity of marble has
disappeared; but still the eye is charmed with
the varied livery of time. The western front is rich
in golden hues, and seems as if it had absorbed the
evening beams<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>; little white appears, except the
tympanum and part of the entablature. But the
brightest orange colour, and grey and sulphury hues,
combine in sweetest harmony. The noble shafts of
the huge columns are uniformly toned with yellow, of
a brownish cast, admitting here and there a little
grey. Casting the eye to the inner cell, we see dark
hues of olive mixed with various tints, adorning the
existing frieze and pillars; and these, opposed to brilliant
white, afford a point and power of expression,
which never fails to please."</p>

<p>Sir J. C. Hobhouse says, Lord Elgin's injuries
were these; the taking off the metopes, the statue
over the theatre of Bacchus, and the statues of the
west pediment of the Parthenon; and the carrying
away one of the Caryatides, and the finest of the
columns of the Erectheum. "No other," continues<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Sir John, "comes, I believe, within the limits of censure&mdash;no
other marbles were detached."</p>

<p>The monuments, now called the Elgin marbles,
were chiefly obtained from the Erectheum, the Propyl&aelig;a,
and the Parthenon, more especially the last.
We must here give room to the observations, vindicative
of this proceeding:&mdash;"Perhaps one of the
most judicious measures of government, with reference
to the advancement of the arts in this country, was
the purchase of these remains. We may go farther,
and add, that the removal of them from Athens,
where their destruction was daily going forward, to
place them where their merits would be appreciated,
and their decay suspended, was not only a justifiable
act, but one which deserves the gratitude of England
and of the civilised world. The decay of the Athenian
monuments may be attributed to various causes.
'Fire and the barbarian' have both done their work.
Athens has seen many masters. The Romans were
too refined to destroy the monuments of art: but the
Goths had a long period of spoliation; and then came
the Turks, at once proud and ignorant, despising
what they could not understand. The Acropolis
became a garrison in their hands, and thus, in 1687, it
was bombarded by the Venetians, whose heavy guns
were directed against the porticoes and colonnades of
the ancient temples. But the Turks still continued to
hold their conquests; and the business of demolition
went steadily on for another century and a half.
Many travellers who visited Athens about a hundred
years ago, and even much later, describe monuments
of sculpture which now have no existence. The
Turks pounded the marble into dust to make lime;
one traveller after another continued to remove a fragment.
The museums of Egypt were successively
adorned with these relics; at last, when, as column
after column fell, the remains of Athens were be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>coming
less and less worthy of notice, covered in the
dust, or carted away to be broken up for building,
Lord Elgin, who had been ambassador at Constantinople
in 1799, obtained, in 1801, an authority from
the Turkish government, called a firmaun, which eventually
enabled the British nation to possess the most
valuable of the sculptures of which any portion was
left. The authority thus granted empowered Lord
Elgin to fix scaffolding around the ancient temple of
the Idols 'to mould the ornamental and visible figures
thereon in plaster and gypsum;' and, subsequently,
'to take away any pieces of stone with old inscriptions
or figures thereon.' For several years the
intentions of Lord Elgin were carried into effect at
his private risk, and at a cost which is stated to have
amounted to 74,000<i>l</i>, including the interest of
money. In 1816, the entire collection was purchased
of Lord Elgin by act of parliament for 35,000<i>l.</i> It
is unnecessary for us to go into the controversy,
whether it was just to remove these relics from their
original seats. Had the Greeks been able to preserve
them, there can be no doubt of the injustice of such
an act. The probability is, that if foreign governments
had not done what Lord Elgin did as an individual,
there would not have been a fragment left at
this day to exhibit the grandeur of the Grecian art
as practised by Phidias. The British nation, by the
purchase of these monuments, has secured a possession
of inestimable value<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>From these observations, it would appear that the
spoliation of the Parthenon may be vindicated on the
ground, that neither the Turks nor the citizens cared
any thing about them, and that if they had not been
taken away, they would, in a short time, have been
destroyed. Respectable testimony, however, is opposed
to this: most travellers have inveighed against
the spoliation; and two, highly qualified, have given
a very different account from what the above statement
implies. These are Dr. Clarke and Mr. Dodwell.
We shall select the testimony of the latter in preference
to that of Dr. Clarke, only because he was
at Athens at the very time in which the spoliation
was going on. "During my first tour to Greece,"
says he, "I had the inexpressible mortification of
being present when the Parthenon was despoiled of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
its finest sculpture, and when some of its architectural
members were thrown to the ground." * * *
"It is, indeed, impossible to suppress the feelings
of regret which must arise in the breast of every
traveller, who has seen these temples before and since
their late dilapidation! Nor have I any hesitation
in declaring, that the Athenians in general, nay,
even the Turks themselves, did lament the ruin that
was committed; and loudly and openly blamed their
sovereign for the permission he had granted! I
was on the spot at the time, and had an opportunity
of observing, and, indeed, of participating, in the
sentiment of indignation, which such conduct universally
inspired. The whole proceeding was so
unpopular in Athens, that it was necessary to pay
the labourers more than their usual profits, before
any one could be prevailed upon to assist in this
work of profanation."</p>

<p>"Such rapacity is a crime against all ages and all
generations," says Mr. Eustace; "it deprives the past
of the trophies of their genius and the title-deeds of
their fame; the present of the strongest inducements
to exertion, the noblest exhibitions that curiosity can
contemplate; and the future of the master-pieces of
art, the models of imitation. To guard against the
repetition of such depredations is the wish of every
man of genius, the duty of every man in power, and
the common interest of every civilised nation."</p>

<p>"That the Elgin marbles will contribute to the
improvement of art in England," says Mr. Williams,
"cannot be doubted. They must, certainly, open
the eyes of the British artists, and prove that the
true and only road to simplicity and beauty is the
study of nature. But had we a right to diminish
the interest of Athens for selfish motives, and prevent
successive generations of other nations from seeing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
those admirable structures? The temple of Minerva
was spared as a beacon to the world, to direct it to
the knowledge of purity and of taste. What can we
say to the disappointed traveller, who is now deprived
of the rich satisfaction that would have compensated
his travel and his toil? It will be little
consolation to him to say, he may find the sculpture
of the Parthenon in England<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>."</p>

<p>Babylon and Nineveh appear to have resembled
each other, not only in form but in extent and population.
Quintus Curtius asserts, that Babylon owed
its origin to Semiramis. In the Bible, however, it
having been stated, that one of the chief cities of
Nimrod was Babel; many authors have given into
the idea, that Babylon was built by Nimrod. If
we attend strictly to the words of Moses, however, we
shall find that to have been an impossible circumstance.</p>

<p>Moses states, that Nimrod had four large cities<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.
Those were Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneth.
Nimrod was a descendant of Ham; but the temple of
Babel, on the establishment of which depends the
origin of Babylon, was built by the descendants of
Shem:&mdash;at least, we have the right to believe so; for
Moses mentions the descendants of Shem last, and
then goes on to say:&mdash;"The whole earth was of one
language and of one speech: and it came to pass, as
they journeyed from the East, that they found a plain
in the land of Shinar, and they dwelt there."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>When they had dwelt there some time, they said
to one another, "Go to, let us make brick, and burn
them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone,
and slime had they for mortar." This was the first
of the subsequent town. They had not yet aspired
to any particular distinction. At length they said
to themselves, "Let us build a city and a tower;
and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered
abroad upon the face of the whole earth." They were
interrupted in their design, and "they left off building
the city." There is, however, no account of its
having been destroyed; nor any in regard to the
destruction of the temple. The people, however,
were scattered<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>.</p>

<p>This city was, subsequently, called Babel; and
the temple of Belus being the oldest temple recorded
in history, it has been generally supposed,
that it was no other than the tower, the family of
Shem had endeavoured to build. This, however, is
far from being certain; for Josephus, who, in this
case is not without his weight, relates that the tower
was thrown down by an impetuous wind or violent
hurricane; and that it never was rebuilt.</p>

<p>The fact is, that the real origin of Babylon
is lost in the depth of history; and all that can
be stated, with any degree of certainty, is, that Nineveh
and Babylon were founded much about the
same time, and that Ninus, Semiramis, Ninyas, and
Sardanapalus were sovereigns, though not during
their whole lives, of both cities. This appears to us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
to be the only way in which we can understand the
history of the first Assyrian empire.</p>

<p>We have no space to enter into the particular
history of this most celebrated of all cities; neither
does the plan of our work admit of it: our province
only being to record its origin, to describe its ancient
state, to give an account of its destruction, and then
describe, from the pages of authentic travellers, the
ruins which still remain.</p>

<p>Having given some account of its origin, we proceed
to describe the height to which it was exalted.
"The Assyrians," says Herodotus, "are masters of
many capital towns; but their place of greatest
strength and fame is Babylon<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>; where, after the
destruction of Nineveh, was the royal residence. It
is situated on a large plain, and is a perfect square;
each side, by every approach is, in length, one hundred
and twenty furlongs; the space, therefore,
occupied by the whole, is four hundred and eighty
furlongs: so extensive is the ground which Babylon
occupies. Its internal beauty and magnificence
exceeds whatever has come within my knowledge.
It is surrounded by a trench, very wide, deep, and
full of water; the wall beyond this is two hundred
royal cubits high<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>, and fifty wide; the royal exceeds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
the common cubit by three digits<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>." "It will not be
foreign to my purpose," continues the historian, "to
describe the use to which the earth dug out of the
trench was converted, as well as the particular
manner in which they constructed the wall. The
earth of the trench was first of all laid in heaps, and
when a sufficient quantity was obtained, made into
square bricks, and baked in a furnace. They used,
as cement, a composition of heated bitumen, which,
mixed with the tops of reeds, was placed between
every thirtieth course of bricks. Having thus lined
the sides of the trench, they proceeded to build the
wall in a similar manner; on the summit of which,
and fronting each other, they erected small watchtowers
of one story, leaving a space betwixt them,
through which a chariot and four horses might pass
and turn. In the circumference of the wall, at different
distances, were a hundred massy gates of
brass<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>, whose hinges and frames were of the same
metal. Within eight days' journey from Babylon is
a city called Is, near which flows a river of the same
name, which empties itself into the Euphrates.
With the current of this river, particles of bitumen
descend towards Babylon, by means of which its
walls are constructed. The great river Euphrates,
which, with its deep and rapid streams, rises in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
the Armenian mountains, and pours itself into the
Red Sea<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>, divides Babylon into two parts. The
walls meet and form an angle at the river at each
extremity of the town, where a breast-work of burnt
bricks begins, and is continued along each bank. The
city, which abounds in houses from three to four
stories in height, is regularly divided into streets.
Through these, which are parallel, there are transverse
avenues to the river opened through the wall and
breast-work, and secured by an equal number of
little gates of brass."</p>

<p>The historian then proceeds to describe the fortifications
and the temple of Belus. "The first wall
is regularly fortified; the interior one, though less in
substance, is of about equal strength. Besides these,
in the centre of each division of the city, there is a
circular space surrounded by a wall. In one of these
stands the royal palace, which fills a large and
strongly-defended place. The temple of Jupiter
Belus<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> occupies the other, whose huge gates of brass
may still be seen. It is a square building, each side
of which is of the length of two furlongs. In the
midst, a tower rises of the solid depth and height of
one furlong, upon which, resting as a base, seven
other turrets are built in regular succession. The
ascent is on the outside; which, winding from the
ground, is continued to the highest tower; and in
the middle of the whole structure there is a conve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>nient
resting-place. In the last tower is a large
chapel, in which is placed a couch magnificently
adorned, and near it a table of solid gold; but there
is no statue in the place." Herodotus, however,
states, that in another part of the temple there was a
statue of Jupiter, in a sitting posture, with a large
table before him; and that these, with the base of
the table and the seat of the throne, were all of the
purest gold, and were estimated in his time, by the
Chaldeans, at not less than eight hundred talents.</p>

<p>We may here give place to a passage in a modern
poem, highly descriptive of its ancient state.</p>

<p class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">Those walls, within</span><br />
Whose large inclosure the rude hind, or guides<br />
His plough, or binds his sheaves, while shepherds guard<br />
Their flocks, scure of ill: on the broad top<br />

Branch'd from the current of his roaring flood.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 15em;"><span class="smcap">Dr. Roberts</span>, <i>Judah Restored</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Thus we find the walls to have extended to a vast
circumference&mdash;from forty-eight to sixty miles; but
we are not to suppose them to have been entirely
filled up with houses;<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> but, as in the old city of
Moscow, to have been in no small part taken up with
gardens and other cultivated lands.</p>

<p>In regard to the size of some ancient Eastern cities,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Mr. Franklin has made some very pertinent remarks, in
his inquiry concerning the site of the ancient Palibothra:&mdash;"For
the extent of the city and suburbs
of Palibothra, from seventy-five to eighty miles have
been assigned by the Puranas; a distance, said to be
impossible for the space occupied by a single city.
So, indeed, it might, were we to compare the cities of
Asia with those of Europe. The idea of lofty houses
of brick and stone, consisting of many stories, with a
number of inhabitants, like those of London, Paris,
Vienna, and many others, must not be compared
with the nature of the Asiatic cities. To look in
them for regularly-built squares, and spacious and
paved streets, would be absurd."</p>

<p>Herodotus gives the extent of the walls of Babylon
at one hundred and twenty stades on each side, or four
hundred and eighty stades in circumference. Diodorus
three hundred and sixty stades in circumference. Clitarchus,
who accompanied Alexander, three hundred
and sixty-five. Curtius states it at three hundred and
sixty-eight; and Strabo at three hundred and eighty-five
stades. The general approximation of these
measurements would lead us to suppose that the
same stade was used by the different reporters; and
if this was the Greek itinerary stade, we may estimate
the circumference of the great city at twenty-five
British miles<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>. "The lines, drawn on maps, are
often only used to divide distant mounds of ruin.
Accumulations of pottery and brickwork are met
with occasionally over a great tract; but the connection,
supposed between these and the corn-fields
and gardens, within the common precincts of a wall,
is gratuitous in the extreme. Imagine London and
Paris to be levelled, and the inhabitant of some
future city to visit their ruins, as those of then remote
antiquity; if, in the one instance, S&egrave;vres, Mont<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Rouge, and Vincennes, or, in the other, Greenwich,
Stratford-le-Bow, Tottenham, Highgate, Hammersmith,
Richmond, and Clapham, be taken in as
boundaries, or identified respectively as the ruins of
Paris and London, what a prodigious extent would
those cities gain in the eyes of futurity<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>!"</p>

<p>Babylon, as we have already stated, stood upon
the Euphrates, as Nineveh did upon the Tigris. A
branch of it ran entirely through the city from north
to south; and on each side was a quay, walled
towards the river, of the same thickness as the city
walls. In these, also, were gates of brass, from
which persons descended to the water by steps;
whence, for a long time, they crossed to the other
side in boats; that is, until the building of a bridge.
These gates were open always in the day, but shut
at night. A bridge was at length erected; and this
bridge was equally celebrated with the other great
buildings; for it was of vast size; but Diodorus
would seem to make it to have been much larger
than it really was. He says it was five furlongs in
length. Now as the Euphrates, at the spot, was
only one furlong wide, this would be impossible; so
we suppose that there must have been a causeway
on each side of the bridge; and that Diodorus included
the two causeways, which were, probably,
merely dry arches, as we find in a multitude of modern
bridges. It was, nevertheless, thirty feet in
breadth, and built with great skill. The arches
were of hewn stone, fastened together with chains of
iron and melted lead. To effect the building with
the greater care and safety, they turned the course of
the river<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>, and laid the channel dry. While one
part of the workmen were doing this, others were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
shaping the materials for the quays, so that all were
finished at the same time.</p>

<p>During a certain portion of the year (viz., June,
July, and August) the Euphrates overflows its banks,
as the Nile does in Egypt, the Ganges in India, and
the Amazon in South America. To remedy the
manifold inconveniences arising from this, two large
canals were cut to divert the superabundant waters
into the Tigris, before they could reach Babylon<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>;
and to secure the neighbouring country still the
better, they raised artificial banks,&mdash;as the Dutch
have done in Holland,&mdash;of a vast size, on both sides
the river; not built, however, of earth, as in Holland,
but of brick cemented with bitumen, which
began at the head of the canals, and extended for
some distance below the city. To effect all this, the
Euphrates, which had been turned one way, in order
to build the bridge, was turned another to build the
banks. To this end they dug a vast lake, forty
miles square, and one hundred and sixty in compass,
and thirty-five feet deep. Into this lake
the river was diverted, till the banks were finished;
after which it was re-diverted into the former channel.
The lake was, however, still preserved as a
reservoir<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of our readers may be curious to
know how long it would take to fill this lake up.
It is thus stated in the Edinburgh Review<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>:&mdash;"Taking
it at the lowest dimensions of a square of
forty miles, by thirty feet deep; and supposing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Euphrates to be five hundred feet wide, ten deep,
and to flow at the rate of two miles an hour, it would
require one thousand and fifty-six days to fill the lake,
allowing no absorption to the sides; but if absorption
and evaporation are taken into the account, we may
put the time at four years, or thereabouts; which, no
doubt, would be sufficient, considering the number
of hands employed, to complete the embankment<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>."</p>

<p>This lake, the bridge, and the quays of the river
are ascribed to Nitocris, by Herodotus; but most of
the other wonders of Babylon are ascribed by Josephus
to Nebuchadnezzar, her father-in-law. "Perhaps,"
says one of the historians, "Nitocris might
only finish what her father had left imperfect at his
death, on which account the historian might give her
the honour of the whole undertaking."</p>

<p>We are now called upon to describe other wonders.
These are the palaces and hanging gardens.
At each end of the bridge stood a palace; and those
two palaces had a communication each with the
other by means of a passage under the bed of the
river, vaulted at the time in which it was laid dry<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>.
The <i>old</i> palace, which stood on the east side of the
river, was three miles and three quarters in compass.
It stood near the temple of Belus. The <i>new</i> palace
stood on the west side. It was much larger than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
old one; being seven miles and a half in compass<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>.
It was surrounded with three walls, one within the
other, with considerable spaces between; and these,
with those at the other palace, were embellished
with an infinite variety of sculptures, representing all
kinds of animals to the life; amongst which was one
more celebrated than all the rest. This was a
hunting piece, representing Semiramis on horseback
throwing a javelin; and Ninus, her husband, piercing
a lion.</p>

<p>Near the old palace stood a vast structure, known
from all antiquity, and celebrated in every age as the
most wonderful structure ever yet built; viz., the
temple of Belus. We have given some account of
it from Herodotus already. A tower of vast size
stood in the middle of it. At its foundation it was
a square of a furlong on each side; that is, half a
mile in its whole compass, and the eighth part of a
mile in height. It consisted of eight towers, built
one above another, gradually decreasing in size to
the top. Its height exceeded that of the largest of
the pyramids<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>. It was built of bricks and bitumen.
The ascent to the top was on the outside, by means
of stairs, winding, in a spiral line, eight times round
the tower from the bottom to the top. There were
many large rooms in the different stories, with arched
roofs, supported by pillars. On the top was an
observatory, the Babylonians having been more celebrated
than any other people of ancient times for
their knowledge of astronomy<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>
<p>Notwithstanding the opinions of many, that this
tower was built expressly for astronomical purposes,
it appears certain that it was used as a temple also;
for the riches of it were immense; consisting of statues,
tables, censers, cups, and other sacred vessels,
all of massy gold. Among these was a statue, weighing
a thousand talents of Babylon, forty feet high.
Indeed, so rich was this temple, that Diodorus does
not hesitate to value all it contained at not less than
six thousand three hundred Babylonian talents of
gold; which implies a sum equivalent to twenty-one
millions of pounds sterling! Surely some error must
have crept into the MS.</p>

<p>This temple stood till the time of Xerxes. On the
return of that prince from Greece he plundered it;
and then caused it to be entirely demolished. When
Alexander returned from India, he formed the design
of rebuilding it upon the ancient plan; and probably,
had he lived, he would have accomplished his wish.
Ten thousand men were put to work to clear away the
rubbish; but he died in the midst of his preparation.</p>

<p>Many of the chief erections in this city were
planned and executed by Semiramis. When she had
finished them, she made a progress through the various
divisions of her empire; and wherever she went
left monuments of her magnificence, by many noble
structures, which she erected, either for the convenience
or the ornament of her cities<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>. She was the
best political economist of ancient times, and may
truly be styled the first utilitarian: for she applied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>herself to the formation of causeways, the improvement
of roads, the cutting through mountains, and
the filling up valleys. She applied herself, also, most
particularly, to the forming of aqueducts, in order
that water might be conveyed to such places as
wanted it: in hot climates desiderata of the first
importance.</p>

<p>Valerius Maximus<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> records a circumstance of her,
which paints the influence she possessed over her
people in a very striking manner. One day, as she
was dressing herself, word was brought that a tumult
was raging in the city. Without waiting to dress
herself, she hurried from her palace with her head
half dressed, and did not return till the disturbance
was entirely appeased<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>.</p>

<p>We now pass on to the dream of Nebuchadnezzar,
because the accomplishment of that dream is connected
with the splendid state of Babylon in the time
of its glory. This dream was, that<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> "he saw a tree
in the midst of the earth, whose height was great:
the tree grew, and was strong, and the height of it
reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end
of the earth. The leaves were fair, and the fruit
much; and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the
field had shadow under it, and the fowls of heaven
dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of
it. I saw the visions of my head on the bed, and,
behold, a watcher, and an holy one, came down from
heaven; he cried aloud, and said thus:&mdash;'Hew
down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his
leaves, and scatter his fruit; let the beasts get away
from under it, and the fowls from his branches.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Nevertheless, leave the stump of his roots in the
earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the
tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the
dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts
in the grass of the earth. Let his heart be changed
from man's, and let a beast's heart be given to him.
This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the
demand of the word of the holy ones, to the intent
that the living may know, that the Most High
ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth to whomsoever
he will, and setteth up over it the basest of
men.'"</p>

<p>This dream was expounded by Daniel. "Let the
dream be to them, O king, that hate thee; and the
interpretation thereof to thine enemies." The prophet
then declared, "that the king should be driven
from the company of men for seven years; should be
reduced to the fellowship of the beasts of the field,
and feed upon grass like oxen; that his kingdom
should, nevertheless, be preserved for him, and he
should repossess his throne, when he should have
learnt to know and acknowledge, that all power is
from above, and cometh from heaven."</p>

<p>At the end of twelve months, as Nebuchadnezzar
was walking in his palace, and admiring the beauty
and magnificence of his buildings, he became so
elated at the sight of the structures he had erected,
that he exclaimed&mdash;"Is not this great Babylon, that
I have built for the house of the kingdom by the
might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty?"
In an instant, a voice came from heaven
declaratory of his fate, and his understanding was
taken from him. He was driven from men, and did
eat grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the
dew of heaven; till his hairs were grown like eagles'
feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.</p>

<p>At the expiration of seven years he recovered his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
intellectual powers. He was restored to his throne,
and became more powerful than he had been before.
At this period he is supposed to have built the
hanging gardens, which have been so celebrated in
every age. Amytis, his wife, having been bred in
Media,&mdash;for she was the daughter of Astyages, king
of that country,&mdash;had been much taken with the
mountains and woody parts of her native country,
and therefore desired to have something like it at
Babylon. To gratify this passion, the king, her
husband, raised the hanging gardens. Diodorus,
however, ascribes them to Cyrus; and states that
he built them to gratify a courtezan.</p>

<p>They are thus described by Quintus Curtius:&mdash;"Near
the castle are those wonders, which are so
often celebrated by the Greek poets; gardens elevated
in the air, consisting of entire groves of trees,
growing as high as the tops of the towers, marvellously
beautiful and pleasant from their height and
shade. The whole weight of them is sustained and
borne up by huge pillars, upon which there is a floor
of square stone, that both upholdeth the earth, that
lies deep on the pillar, and also the cisterns with
which it is watered. The trees that grow upon this
are many of them eight cubits in circumference, and
every thing is as fruitful as if they grew on the
natural ground; and, although process of time destroys
things made by mortal hands, and also even
the works of nature, yet this terrace, although oppressed
with the weight of so much earth, and so
great a multitude of trees, still remains unperished,
being held up by seventy broad walls, distant from
each other about eleven feet. When these trees
(concludes Curtius), are seen afar off, they seem to
be a wood growing upon a mountain." This may
well be, since they comprised a square of about four
hundred feet on every side, and were carried up into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
the air in the manner of several large terraces, one
above another, till the highest equalled the height of
the walls of the city. The floors were laid out
thus<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>:&mdash;On the top of the arches were first laid
large flat stones, sixteen feet long, and four feet
broad; and over them a layer of reed, mixed with
a great quantity of bitumen; over which were
two rows of bricks, closely cemented by plaister;
and then, over all, were laid thick sheets of lead;
and, lastly, upon the lead a vast quantity of mould.
The mould was of sufficient depth to let grow very
large trees, and such were planted in it, together
with other trees, and every description of plant and
flower, that was esteemed proper for shrubberies and
flower-gardens. To improve all this, there was, on
the highest of the terraces, a water-engine, to draw
the water out of the river below, wherewith to water
the whole garden<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>.</p>

<p>Besides all this, there were magazines for corn
and provision, capable of maintaining the inhabitants
for twenty years; and arsenals, which supplied with
arms such a number of fighting men, as seemed equal
to the conquest or defence of the whole monarchy.</p>

<p>If Babylon was indebted to Nebuchadnezzar for
many great buildings, it was still more so to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
daughter Nitocris. She erected a great multitude;
and amongst the rest, one of the gates. On this gate
she caused to be inscribed a command to her successors,
that, when she should be buried under it, none
of them should open the tomb to touch the treasure
which laid there, unless impelled by some great and
overwhelming necessity. Many years passed away,
and no one opened it. At length Darius came to the
city. Reading the inscription, he caused the tomb to
be opened; but alas! instead of finding the vast
treasures he had expected, he beheld only this inscription:&mdash;<i>"If
thou hadst not an insatiable thirst for
money, and a most sordid avaricious soul, thou
wouldst never have broken open the monuments of the
dead."</i></p>

<p>Astyages, king of the Medes, was succeeded by
Cyaxares, uncle to Cyrus. Cyaxares, learning that
the king of Babylon had made great preparations
against him, sent for Cyrus, son of Cambyses,
king of Persia, and placed him at the head of his
army. Before marching, Cyrus addressed those
officers who had followed him from Persia, in the
following manner. "Do you know the nature of the
enemy you have to deal with? They are soft, effeminate,
enervated men, already half conquered by their
own luxury and voluptuousness; men not able to
bear either hunger or thirst; equally incapable of
supporting either the toil of war, or the sight of
danger: whereas you, that are inured, from your
infancy, to a sober and hard way of living; to you,
I say, hunger and thirst are but as sauce, and the
only sauce, to your meals; fatigues are your pleasure;
dangers are your delight; and the love of your country,
and of glory, your only passion. Besides, the
justice of our cause is another considerable advantage.
They are the aggressors. It is the enemy that
attacks us; and it is our friends and allies that require<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
our aid. Can any thing be more just than to repel
the injury they would bring upon us? Is there any
thing more honourable, than to fly to the assistance
of our friends? But what ought to be the principal
motive of your confidence is, that I do not engage in
this expedition without having first consulted the
gods, and implored their protection; for you know
it is my custom to begin all my actions, and all my
undertakings, in that manner."</p>

<p>Cyrus, after several battles, laid siege to Babylon.
It was in the days of Belshazzar. That prince was
absorbed in luxury and sloth. A great festival was
to be held within the palace, and Cyrus heard of it.
He prepared himself, therefore, and all his army.
The court, in the meantime, was rife in every species
of dance, feast, and revelry. In the pride of his
heart, Belshazzar ordered all the gold and silver vessels,
which had been taken from the temple of Jerusalem,
to be brought to the banqueting-room; and
he and his officers, and his wives and his concubines,
drank out of them. No sooner was this done, than
the fingers of a man's hand came out from the wall,
and wrote over the candlestick upon the plaster.</p>

<p>The king saw the hand; and when he saw it "his
countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled
him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and
his knees smote one against another."</p>

<p>He summoned the magi, and made proclamation.
"Whoever shall read this writing, and show me the
interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet,
and have a chain about his neck, and shall be the
third ruler in the kingdom." Daniel, the prophet,
interpreted this writing. "This is the writing that
was written: <span class="smcap">Mene Mene, Tekel, Upharsin</span>. This
is the interpretation of the thing. <span class="smcap">Mene</span>; God hath
numbered thy kingdom, and finished it. <span class="smcap">Tekel</span>;
thou art weighed in the balances, and found want<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>ing.
<span class="smcap">Peres</span>; thy kingdom is divided, and given to
the Medes and Persians<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this interpretation, Belshazzar
continued the feast, and to grace it the more, performed
his promise. He commanded, and "they clothed
Daniel with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about
his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him,
that he should be the third ruler of the kingdom."</p>

<p>In the meantime, Cyrus, well aware of the riot
and luxury prevailing in the king's palace, entered
the city by the river, the waters of which he had
managed to be drawn dry, by means of the sluices.
He and his army entered through the gates of brass,
which opened on the quays. This they did in two
divisions; then they proceeded through the city;
met before the palace; slew the guards; and some of
the company having come out to see what was the
cause of the noise they heard, the soldiers rushed in
and immediately made themselves masters of the
palace. The king, however, in this last extremity,
acted in a manner more worthy than might have been
expected. He put himself at the head of those who
were inclined to support him; but he was quickly
despatched, and all those that were with him. Thus
terminated the Babylonian empire, after a duration
of two hundred and ten years, from the beginning of
the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, who was its founder;
and the fate of which had been so truly foretold.</p>

<p>"Babylon, the glory of kingdoms," says Isaiah,
"and the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall
be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
It shall never be inhabited: neither shall it be dwelt
in from generation to generation; neither shall the
Arabians pitch their tent there; neither shall the
shepherds make their fold there; but wild beasts of
the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there,
and satyrs shall dance there; and the wild beasts of
the island shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons
in their pleasant palaces. I will also make it
a possession for the bittern and pools of water; and
I will sweep it with the besom of destruction."
Events answered the prophecy, though not precisely
at this time<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>.</p>

<p>From this period Babylon belonged to the Persian
kings: but having become greatly affronted by the
transference of the royal court to Susa, the inhabitants
revolted. By this insult, they drew upon themselves
the whole force of the Persian empire. The
inhabitants had provided themselves with every
necessary to support a siege. But lest it might last
longer than they anticipated, they put the most barbarous
act in practice that ever had then been heard
of from the creation of the world. They assembled all
their wives and children, and strangled them; no
man being allowed to preserve more than one wife
and a servant to do the necessary business of his
house. The siege lasted eighteen months. Darius
himself began to despair.</p>

<p>Some friends having taken the liberty, one day, to
propose the question to Darius, who was then holding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
a pomegranate in his hand:&mdash;"What good is there
you would wish to multiply as often as that fruit
contains seeds?" "Such friends as Zopyrus," answered
the king, without hesitation. This answer threw
Zopyrus into one of those paroxysms of zeal, which
can only be justified by the sentiment that gives
them birth.</p>

<p>One morning the king observed one of his courtiers
make his appearance before him, bathed in blood, with
his ears and nose entirely cut off, and his whole body
wounded in many places. When Darius saw this,
he started from his throne, advanced to the wounded
person, and eagerly inquired of him who had treated
him in so terrible a manner? "You, yourself, O
king!" answered Zopyrus. "My wish to render
you a service has put me in this condition. As I
was persuaded that you would never have consented
to this method, I have consulted none but the zeal I
have for your service." He then told the king that
he had formed the plan of going over to the enemy
in that condition.</p>

<p>His plan will be explained in the result. He left
the camp, and proceeded to the walls of Babylon.
When he arrived before the gates, he told the Babylonians
who he was. He was immediately admitted
and carried before the governor. There he complained
of Darius, accusing him of having reduced
him to such an unfortunate condition: and that
because he had advised him to give up the siege.
Saying this, he offered his services to the governor
and people of Babylon: stating that his revenge
would be a sufficient stimulus and reward for his
exertions; and that he would be found fully adequate
to cope with the enemy, since he was well
acquainted with all the arts, and discipline, and stratagems
of the Persians.</p>

<p>When the Babylonians heard all this, and saw the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
dreadful condition in which Zopyrus was, they gave
him the command of as many troops as he desired.
With these he made a sally, and cut off more than a
thousand of the enemy: Darius having previously
concerted with him. In a few days he made another
sally, when he cut off double the number. In
a third he destroyed not less than four thousand.
"Nothing," say the historians, "was now talked of
but the condition and success of Zopyrus." This
was, indeed, so much the case, that he was at length
appointed commander-in-chief. The whole matter,
as we have stated before, was a stratagem between
Zopyrus and Darius. Now, then, as Zopyrus had
become master of the forces, he sent intelligence to
the king. The king approached with his army.
Zopyrus opened the gates, and the city was delivered
into the king's hands.</p>

<p>No sooner did Darius find himself master of the
town, than he ordered its hundred gates to be pulled
down, and its walls to be partly demolished<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>: but,
in order to keep up the population, he caused fifty
thousand women to be brought from the several
provinces of his empire to supply the place of those
the inhabitants had so cruelly destroyed at the beginning
of the siege; and for having perpetrated that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
horrific act, he caused three thousand of the most
distinguished of the nobility to be crucified<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>.</p>

<p>Babylon remained in the possession of the kings
of Persia for several generations<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>. But it soon
ceased to be a royal residence, the sovereigns having
chosen to reside either at Shusan, Ecbatana, or Persepolis;
and, the better to reduce it to ruin, they
built Seleucia in its neighbourhood, and caused
the chief portion of its inhabitants to remove to
Ctesiphon.</p>

<p>The course of our subject now descends to the
time, when Darius Codomanus became sovereign of
Babylon, in right of being king of Persia. This
prince was conquered at the Granicus by Alexander.
Not long after, he lost another battle; viz. that of
Arbela: after which the conqueror made what is
called his "triumphant entry" into Babylon. He
entered, we are told, at the head of his army, as if
he had been marching to a battle. "The walls,"
says the historian, "were lined with people, notwithstanding
the greatest part of the citizens were gone
out before, from the impatient desire they had to see
their new sovereign, whose renown had far outstripped
his march. The governor and guardian of
the treasure strewed the street with flowers, and
raised on both sides of the way silver altars, which
smoked not only with frankincense, but the most
fragrant perfumes of every kind. Last of all, came the
presents, which were made to the king; viz. herds
of cattle and a great number of horses; also lions
and panthers, which were carried in cages. After
these the magi walked, singing hymns after the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
manner of their country; then the Chald&aelig;ans, accompanied
by the Babylonian soothsayers and musicians.
It was customary for the latter to sing the praises of
their king to their instruments; and the Chald&aelig;ans
to observe the motion of the planets and the vicissitudes
of seasons." "The rear," continues the author,
from whom we quote, "was brought up by the
Babylonish cavalry, which, both men and horsemen,
were so sumptuous, that imagination can scarce
reach their magnificence." The king caused the
people to walk after his infantry, and, himself surrounded
by his guards, and seated on a chariot,
entered the city, and from thence rode to the palace.
On the next day he took a survey of all Darius'
money and movables. These, however, he did not
keep to himself. He distributed a large portion of
it to his troops: giving to each Macedonian horseman
fifteen pounds; to each mercenary horseman
about five pounds; to every Macedonian foot-soldier
five pounds; and to every one of the rest two
months of their ordinary pay. Nor did he stop
there. He gave orders, that all the temples which
had been thrown down by the order of Xerxes
should be rebuilt; most especially that of Belus.</p>

<p>On his second visit to this city, he was met some
miles from the town by a deputation of old men,
who told him that the stars had indicated that, if he
ventured into the city, some signal misfortune would
befal him. At first the king was greatly alarmed
and perplexed. But having consulted some Greek philosophers
who chanced to be in his army, they threw
such contempt on astrology in general, and the
Babylonish astrologers in particular, that he resolved
to continue his march, and the same day entered the
city with all his army.</p>

<p>Soon after this, designing to raise a monument to
his friend Heph&aelig;stion, he caused nearly six furlongs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
of the city wall to be beat down; and having got
together a vast number of skilful workmen, he built
a very magnificent monumental structure over the
part he had caused to be levelled.</p>

<p>That the reader may have a distinct idea of the
grandeur of this structure, it is necessary to admit a
full account of it. It is thus given in Rollin's
"History of Alexander":&mdash;"It was divided into
thirty parts, in each of which was raised a uniform
building, the roof of which was covered with great
planks of palm-tree wood. The whole formed a
perfect square, the circumference of which was
adorned with extraordinary magnificence. Each
side was a furlong, or an hundred fathoms in length.
At the foot of it, and in the first row, there was set
two hundred and forty-four prows of ships gilded, on
the buttresses or supporters whereof the statues of
two archers, four cubits high, with one knee on the
ground, were fixed; and two other statues, in an
upright posture, completely armed, bigger than the
life, being five cubits in height. The spaces between
the rows were spread and adorned with scarlet cloth.
Over these prows was a colonnade of large flambeaux
which, ending at top, terminated towards eagles, which,
with their heads turned downwards, and extended
wings, served as capitals. Dragons fixed near, or
upon the base, turned their heads upwards towards
the eagles. Over this colonnade stood a third, in the
base of which was represented, in relievo, a party of
hunting animals of every kind. On the superior
order, that is, the fourth, the combat of Centaurs was
represented in gold. Finally, on the fifth, golden
figures, representing lions and bulls, were placed
alternately. The whole edifice terminated with military
trophies after the Macedonian and Babylonian
fashion, as so many symbols of the victory of the
former, and the defeat of the latter. On the enta<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>blatures
and roofs were represented Syrens, the hollow
bodies of which were filled, but in an imperceptible
manner, with musicians, who sang mournful airs and
dirges in honour of the deceased. This edifice was
upwards of one hundred and thirty cubits high; that
is, one hundred and ninety-five feet. The beauty
and the design of this structure," concludes our author,
"the singularity and magnificence of the decorations,
and the several ornaments of it, surpassed the most
wonderful productions of fancy, and were all in
exquisite taste. The designer and architect of
the whole, was Stasicrates; he who offered to cut
Mount Athos into the shape of a man. The cost of
this monument was no less than twelve thousand
talents; that is, more than one million eight hundred
thousand pounds!"</p>

<p>Alexander resided at Babylon more than a year.
During this time he planned a multitude of things;
amongst which, we are told that, finding Babylon
to surpass in extent, in conveniency, and in whatever
can be wished, either for the necessities or pleasures
of life, all the other cities of the East, he resolved to
make it the seat of his empire<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>. With this view he
planned many improvements, and undertook some;
and would have, doubtless, accomplished much that
he intended, for he was still but a very young man,
when death cut him short in the midst of his career&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
Leaving a name, at which the world grew pale,<br />
To point a moral, or adorn a tale<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p class="noidt">And this calls to our recollection the prophecies which
had been uttered:&mdash;"I will cut off from Babylon
the name and remnant." "I will make it a possession
for the bittern." "I will sweep it with the besom
of destruction." "It shall never be inhabited; neither
shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation."</p>

<p>Such was the fate of this city; insomuch that, in
process of time it became entirely forsaken, and the
Persian kings made a park among its ruins, in which
they kept wild beasts for hunting. Instead of citizens,
there were boars, leopards, bears, deer, and
wild asses. Nothing remained but portions of its
walls, a great part even of these at last fell down.
They were never repaired, and for many ages, so great
was the ruin, that even the remains of it were supposed
to have been swept from the face of the earth<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>A short time after the death of Alexander, Babylon
became a theatre for hostility between Demetrius
and Seleucus. Seleucus had got possession of the
city. When Antigonus learned this, he sent his son,
Demetrius, with an army to drive him out of it.
Demetrius, according to his father's order, gathered
all the force he could command at Damascus, and
marched thence to Babylon; where, finding that
Seleucus had gone into Media, he entered the city
without opposition; but, to his great surprise and
mortification, he found it in great part deserted.
The cause was this: Seleucus had left the town under
the charge of a governor named Patrocles. When
Demetrius was within a short distance, this governor
retreated out of the walls into the fens, and commanded
all persons to fly from the city. This multitudes
of them did; some into the deserts, and
others beyond the Tigris. Demetrius, finding the
town deserted, laid siege to the castles; for there
were two, both well garrisoned and of large extent.
One of these castles he took; and, having plundered
not only the city, but the whole province, of every
thing he could lay his bands on, he returned to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
father, leaving a garrison. The robbery, however,
did not go unpunished; for the Babylonians were so
grievously offended at it, that, at the return of Seleucus,
they received him with open arms; and thus
began the true reign of Seleucus. That prince, however,
did not long make Babylon his capital. He
built Seleucia on the western bank of the Tigris,
forty miles from Babylon, over against the spot where
now stands the city of Bagdad. To this new city,
Seleucus invited the Babylonians generally to transplant
themselves. This they did, and Babylon became,
in process of time, so desolate, that Strabo assures
us<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> that, in his time, Babylon, "once the greatest
city that the sun ever saw," had nothing left but its
walls.  The area had been ploughed.</p>

<p>In the fourth century St. Jerome notes, that
Babylon was become a park for the Parthian and
afterwards for the Persian kings to keep their wild
beasts for hunting in; the walls being kept up to
serve for a fence for the enclosure. No writer for
several hundred years has been found to mention this
city from this time, till Benjamin of Tudela<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> (in
Navarre) visited the spot, and related, on his return,
that he had stood where this old city had formerly
stood; and that he had found it wholly desolated
and destroyed. "Some ruins," said he, "of Nebuchadnezzar's
palace remain; but men are afraid to go
near them on account of the multitude of serpents
and scorpions there are in the place."</p>

<p>It was afterwards visited by the celebrated Portuguese
traveller, Texeira, who says, "That there
was, in his time, only a few footsteps of this famous
city; and that there was no place in all that country<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
less frequented." In 1574 it was visited by a German
traveller, Rauwolf. "The village of Elugo,"
says he, "lieth on the place where formerly old
Babylon, the metropolis of Chaldea, did stand.
The harbour lieth a quarter of a league off, where-unto
those use to go that intend to travel by land
to the famous city of Bagdad, which is situated
further to the east on the river Tigris, at a day and
a half's distance. This country is so dry and barren
that it cannot be tilled, and so bare that I should
have doubted very much, whether this potent and
powerful city (which once was the most stately and
famous one of the world, situated in the pleasant
and fruitful country of Sinar,) did stand there; if I
had not known it by its situation, and several ancient
and delicate antiquities, that still are standing
hereabout in great desolation<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>. First, by the old
bridge, which was laid over the Euphrates, whereof
there are some pieces and arches still remaining, built
of burned brick, and so strong, that it is admirable.
Just before the village of Elugo is the hill whereon
the castle did stand, in a plain, whereon you may
still see some ruins of the fortification, which is quite
demolished and uninhabited. Behind it, and pretty
near to it, did stand the tower of Babylon. This
we see still, and it is half a league in diameter; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
so mightily ruined and low, and so full of venomous
reptiles, that have bored holes through it, that one
may not come near it within half a mile, but only in
two months in the winter, when they come not out
of their holes<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>."</p>

<p>The next traveller that visited Babylon appears
to have been Della Valle (<small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 1616). When
at Bagdad he was led, by curiosity rather than business,
to visit Babylon, which, says he, was well
known to the people in that city, as well by its name
of Babel, as by the traditions concerning it. "He
found," says Rennell, "at no great distance from the
eastern bank of the Euphrates, a vast heap of ruins,
of so heterogeneous a kind, that, as he expresses it,
he could find nothing whereon to fix his judgment as
to what it might have been in its original state. He
recollected the descriptions of the tower of Belus, in
the writings of the ancients, and supposed that this
might be the ruins of it." He then proceeds to give
measurements; but better accounts have been received
since.</p>

<p>The remains of Babylon have been visited in our
times by several accomplished travellers, amongst
whom may be especially noted Mr. Rich and Sir
Robert Ker Porter. The former of these travellers has
given the most distinct and circumstantial account;
but, before we state what he has afforded us, we afford
space for that passage of Sir Robert, in which he
describes his first entry into the scene.</p>

<p>"We now came to the north-east shore of the
Euphrates, hitherto totally excluded from our view
by the intervening long and varied lines of ruin,
which now proclaimed to us, on every side, that we
were indeed in the midst of what had been Babylon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
From the point, on which we stood, to the base of
the Mujelib&eacute;, large masses of ancient foundations
spread on our right, more resembling natural hills in
appearance, than mounds covering the remains of
former great and splendid edifices. The whole view
was particularly solemn. The majestic stream of the
Euphrates wandering in solitude, like a pilgrim monarch
through the silent ruins of his devastated kingdom,
still appeared a noble river, even under all the
disadvantages of its desert-tracked course. Its banks
were hoary with reeds, and the grey osier willows
were yet there, on which the captives of Israel hung
up their harps, and, while '<i>Jerusalem was not</i>,' refused
to be comforted. But how is the rest of the scene
changed since then! At that time, these broken hills
were palaces; those long, undulating mounds, streets;
this vast solitude, filled with the busy subjects of the
proud daughter of the East! now, '<i>wasted with
misery</i>,' her habitations are not to be found; and,
for herself, '<i>the worm is spread over her</i>.' The banks
of the Euphrates are, nevertheless, still covered with
willows, as they were in ancient times<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>."</p>

<p>For the following particulars we are, principally,
indebted to Mr. Rich, several years British minister
at Bagdad. "The town of Hillah, enclosed within a
brick wall, and known to have been built in the
twelfth century, stands upon the western banks of
the Euphrates (latitude thirty-two degrees, twenty-eight
minutes). It is forty-eight miles south of
Bagdad. The country, for miles around, is a flat,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
uncultivated waste; but it is traversed, in different
directions, by what appear to be the remains of
canals, and by mounds of great magnitude; most of
which, upon being excavated, are found to contain
bricks, some of which were evidently dried in the
sun, others baked by a furnace, and stamped with
inscriptions in a character now unknown." "The
soil of the plains of ancient Assyria and Babylonia,"
says Major Keppell, "consists of a fine clay, mixed
with sand, with which, as the waters retire, the
shores are covered. This compost, when dried with
the heat of the sun, becomes a hard and solid mass,
and forms the finest materials for the beautiful bricks
for which Babylon was celebrated." Hillah is built
of such bricks; but there are others of more ancient
appearance, which, no doubt, belonged to ancient
Babylon; since they are stamped with characters,
which have been ascribed to the Chaldeans. Hillah,
then, stands upon the site of ancient Babylon: that
is, a portion of it.</p>

<p>Though this is certainly the case, there are no
ruins at Hillah; the nearest being at a distance of
two miles to the north, and upon the eastern side of
the river. The first of these remains consists of a
vast mound of earth, three thousand three hundred
feet long, by two thousand four hundred feet broad,
at its base, curved, at the south side, into the form
of a quadrant. Its height is sixty feet at the highest
part: and the whole appears to have been formed by
the decomposition of sun-dried bricks, channelled and
furrowed by the weather; and having the surface
strewed with pieces of pottery, bricks, and bitumen.
This mound is called Amran.</p>

<p>On the north of this mound is another square, of
two thousand one hundred feet, having one of its
angles,&mdash;to the south-west,&mdash;connected with the
other by a ridge, three hundred feet broad, and of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
considerable height. The building, of which this is
a ruin, seems to have been finished in a very particular
manner, for the bricks are of the finest description.
"This is the place," says Mr. Rich, "where
Beauchamp made his observations, and it is certainly
the most interesting part of the ruins of Babylon.
Every vestige discoverable in it declares it to have
been composed of buildings far superior to all the
rest, which have left traces in the eastern quarter:
the bricks are of the finest description; and notwithstanding
this is the grand storehouse of them, and
that the greatest supplies have been, and are now,
constantly drawn from it, they appear still to be
abundant."</p>

<p>To the north of this ruin is a ravine, hollowed out
by brick-searchers, about three hundred feet long,
ninety wide, and one hundred and twenty feet deep.
At the north end of this ravine an opening leads to a
subterranean passage, floored and walled with large
bricks, laid in bitumen, and roofed with single slabs
of sand-stone, three feet thick, and from eight to
twelve long. In this passage was found a colossal
piece of sculpture, in black marble. "There I discovered,"
says Mr. Rich, "what Beauchamp saw
imperfectly, and understood from the natives to be
an idol<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>. I was told the same thing<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>, and that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
was discovered by an old Arab in digging, but that,
not knowing what to do with it, he covered it up
again." On sending for the old man, and he having
pointed out the spot, Mr. Rich set a number of men
to work, and, after a day's hard labour, they laid
open enough of the statue to show that it was a lion
of colossal dimensions, standing on a pedestal. Its
material was a gray granite, and it was of rude
workmanship.</p>

<p>The mound, last described, is called by the natives
the palace (<i>El Kasr</i>)<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>. The walls are eight feet
thick, ornamented with niches, and strengthened by
pilasters and buttresses, all built of fine brick, laid
in lime cement of such tenacity, that it cannot be
separated without breaking. Hence it is, that so
much of it remains perfect. This remarkable ruin is
visible from a considerable distance, and is so fresh,
that it is only upon minute inspection, that Mr. Rich
became satisfied, that it is really a Babylonian remain.
Near this are several hollows, in which several persons
have lost their lives; so that no one will now
venture into them, and their entrances are, therefore,
become choked with rubbish.</p>

<p>There are two paths near this ruin, made by the
workmen, who carry down their bricks to the river
side, whence they are transported to Hillah; and at
a short distance to the north-north-east the celebrated
tree stands, which is called by the natives Athel&egrave;,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
and which they assert to have once flourished in the
hanging gardens; and which they as religiously
believe God purposely preserved, that it might afford
Mahomet a convenient shade, beneath which to tie
up his horse, after the battle of Hillah! It is an
evergreen, of the lignum-vit&aelig; species. "Its trunk
has been originally enormous; but at last, worn
away by time, only part of its original circumference,
hollow and shattered, supports the whole of its yet
spreading and evergreen branches. They are particularly
beautiful, being adorned with long tress-like
tendrils, resembling heron-feathers, growing from a
central stem. These slender and delicate sprays,
bending towards the ground, gave the whole an
appearance of a weeping-willow, while their gentle
waving in the wind made a low and melancholy
sound. This tree is revered as holy by the Arabs,
from a tradition among them, that the Almighty
preserved it here, from the earliest time, to form a
refuge in after ages for the Caliph Ali; who, fainting
with fatigue from the battle of Hillah, found a secure
repose under its shade. The battle adverted to was
fought within so short a period after the death of
Mahomet, that, if any credit is to be given to the
rest of the tale, the age of the tree must already have
extended to a thousand years!"</p>

<p>When Mr. Kinneir visited Hillah the girth of the
tree was, two feet from the ground, four feet seven
inches. Its height twenty feet.</p>

<p>Nine hundred and fifty yards from the side of the
river, and about a mile to the north of what is called
the palace, stands the most remarkable ruin of the
eastern division. This is called Mukallib&egrave;, a word
signifying "overturned." This was visited, in 1616,
by Della Valle, who determined it to be the tower of
Belus; and this opinion has been adopted, erroneously,
by Rennell and other writers. It is of an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
oblong shape, irregular in its height and the measurement
of its sides, which face the cardinal points;
the northern side being two hundred yards in length;
the southern side, two hundred and nineteen; the
eastern, one hundred and eighty-two; and the western,
one hundred and thirty-six. The elevation of the
highest angle, one hundred and forty-one feet. This
mound is a solid mass. Near its summit appears a
low wall, with interruptions, built of unburnt bricks,
laid in clay mortar of great thickness, having a layer
of reeds between every layer of bricks. On the north
side are vestiges of a similar wall. The south-west
angle, which is the highest point, terminates in a
turret; or, rather, heaps of rubbish, in digging into
which, layers of broken burnt brick, cemented with
mortar, are discovered, and whole bricks, with inscriptions
on them, are here and there found. The
whole is covered with innumerable fragments of
brick, pottery, pebbles, bitumen, vitrified scoria, and
even shells, bits of glass, and mother-of-pearl! When
Mr. Rich saw all these, he inquired of the Turk,
that acted as guide, how he imagined the glass and
mother-of-pearl came there?&mdash;"They were brought
here by the deluge," answered the Turk.</p>

<p>In describing this mound, Major Keppell says, that
he found it full of large holes. "We entered one of
them, and found them strewed with the carcases and
skeletons of animals recently killed. The ordure of wild
beasts was so strong, that prudence got the better of
curiosity; for we had no doubt as to the savage
nature of the inhabitants. Our guides, indeed, told
us, that all the ruins abounded in lions and other
wild beasts." Mr. Rich found, also, quantities of
porcupine quills; and most of the cavities, he says,
are peopled with bats and owls.</p>

<p>The pile on the Mujelib&eacute; is called Haroot and
Maroot, by the Arabs; and they believe that, near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the foot of the pyramid, there still exists, though
invisible to mankind, a well, in which those two
wicked angels were condemned by the Almighty to
be suspended by the heels until the end of the world,
as a punishment for their vanity and presumption.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>In another part of the ruins were found a brass
pike and some earthen vessels (one of which was
very thin, and had the remains of fine white varnish
on the outside);&mdash;also a beam of date-tree wood.
Continuing the work downwards, the men arrived at
a passage, in which they discovered a wooden coffin;
opening which they found a skeleton, perfect in all
its parts. Under the head was placed a round
pebble, and a brass ornament was attached to the
skeleton. On the outside, another brass ornament
was found, representing a bird: and a little farther
on, they discovered the skeleton of a child. No skulls
were found, either here or in the sepulchral urns
that were at the bank of the river.</p>

<p>Mr. Rich, also, found a number of urns, in the
bulwark on the banks of the river. These contained
ashes, and bones in small fragments. Comparing
these remains with the skeletons found in the Mujelib&eacute;,
he judiciously remarks, that the two modes of
sepulture decidedly prove what people they were
who were so interred. "There is, I believe," he adds,
"no reason to suppose that the Babylonians burnt
their dead: the old Persians, we know, never did."
It was the common usage with the Greeks. "From
this he infers," says Porter, "that the skeletons in
the Mujelib&eacute; were the remains of the ancient people
of Babylon; and the urns in the embankment contained
the ashes of Alexander's soldiers."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>From the south-east angle of the Mujelib&eacute;, a
mound extends in a circular direction, and joins the
Amran at its south-east angle, the diameter of the
sweep being two miles and a half. This is supposed
to have been the fortified enclosure that is described
by Herodotus as encircling the palace.</p>

<p>To the north of the Mujelib&eacute; there are no ruins
of any importance. A few low mounds, however,
are observed, occurring at intervals, on each side of
the road from Hillah to Bagdad; but they are of an
insignificant character, and, from their situation,
they are supposed to have been burying-places outside
the city, rather than buildings within its walls.</p>

<p>The Mujelib&eacute; is supposed to have been a Babylonian
mausoleum, rather than a temple of worship.
In respect to the other ruins, it is probable that the
Kasr and adjacent mounds are the remains of the
royal palace, with its hanging gardens, enclosed with
the circular mound, which formed the outer wall of
the palace mentioned by Herodotus, and described
more in detail by Diodorus.</p>

<p>Two or three miles upwards from the river, are
the remains of what have, hitherto, been considered
remains of canals. A recent traveller<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>, however,
seems inclined to believe, that they are the remains
of streets. His reasoning is probable. Canals would
go all one way; but most of these cross each other at
right angles, with immense spaces of open and level
ground on each side of them.</p>

<p>We are now to note something in regard to what
appears on the west side of the Euphrates. "The
loose and inaccurate accounts of some modern travellers,"
says Mr. Rich, "have misled D'Anville and
Rennell into the belief of there being considerable
ruins on the western side of the river, similar to those
on the eastern." This, however, does not appear to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
be the case; that is, near to the river. But although
there are none in the immediate neighbourhood, by
far the most stupendous and surprising mass of all
the ruins of Babylon is situated on this side, about
six miles from Hillah. This is the tower of Babel,
otherwise the temple of Belus. It is called by the
Arabs, <i>Birs Nemroud</i>; by the Jews Nebuchadnezzar's
Prison. The shape of this vast ruin is oblong, having
the appearance of a fallen or decayed pyramid. It is
two thousand two hundred and eighty-six feet in
compass at the base; and, on the west side, it rises
conically to the height of one hundred and ninety-eight
feet. "I visited the Birs," says Mr. Rich,
"under circumstances peculiarly favourable to grandeur
of effect. The morning was at first stormy, and
threatened a severe fall of rain; but, as we approached
the object of our journey, the heavy clouds
separating, discovered the Birs frowning over the
plain, and presenting the appearance of a circular
hill, crowned by a tower, with a high ridge extending
along the foot of it. It being entirely concealed
from our view, during the first part of our ride, prevented
our acquiring the gradual idea, in general so
prejudicial to effect, and so particularly lamented by
those who visit the pyramids. Just as we were
within the proper distance, it burst at once upon our
sight, in the midst of rolling masses of thick black
clouds, partially obscured by that kind of haze whose
indistinctness is one great cause of sublimity; whilst
a few strong catches of stormy light, thrown upon
the desert in the back ground, served to give some
idea of the immense extent, and dreary solitude, of
the wastes in which this remarkable ruin stands."</p>

<p>Two stages of building are visible on the eastern
side. The lowest is sixty feet high, and is broken in
the middle by a deep ravine, and intersected on all
sides by channels, made by the winter rains. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
summit of this first stage was once flat; but it is no
longer so; its margin having crumbled down so as to
give this side the appearance of a cone. The second
stage rises above the first, also, in a conical form, but
much more steep; the summit being marked by a
perpendicular fragment of brick work; which is probably
the base of the third stage.</p>

<p>On the west side, the structure rises at once from
the plain like a pyramid; the face being broken in
different directions, partly by the torrents, and partly
by what seems to have been some convulsion of nature.
At the foot of the northern side, vast masses
of solid brick-work are scattered over the rubbish.
The building is seen to most advantage to the south;
for on that side it is by far the most perfect. The
tower there rises by high and distinct stages (four),
receding one within another, in proportion to their
respective elevations. "Here is a ruin," says an
elegant writer, "corresponding, in a most surprising
degree, with the tower of Belus, as described by
Herodotus. The total circumference of the base is
two thousand two hundred and eighty-six feet instead
of one thousand nine hundred and sixty, the
square of a stadium. The east and west sides remain
of the original breadth nearly, and a greater portion
of rubbish from the top crumbled down upon their
sides, the north and south are thereby elongated; the
present height of the ruin, to the top of the wall,
is two hundred and thirty-five feet&mdash;less than
one-half of the original height&mdash;consequently the
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> round the base might be expected to be much
more considerable, so as to make the circumference of
the base greater than it appears to be. But it must
be remembered, that Alexander the Great, when he
took possession of Babylon, after the defeat of Darius,
employed ten thousand men for two months in re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>moving
the rubbish, preparatory to removing the
tower<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>. It is probable they had only cleared the
south side, before the work was abandoned; which
would account for the south face being more perfect
than any of the others. If we add to this, that vast
quantities of the bricks have been taken away by
the natives of the country, for building modern
towns, the circumstance that the base so little exceeds
the dimensions, given by Herodotus, will no
longer appear unaccountable."</p>

<p>On Sir Robert Ker Porter's second visit to the Birs
Nimrod, his party descried several dark objects
moving along the summit of its hill, which they
construed into dismounted Arabs on the look out,
while their armed brethren were lying concealed
under the southern brow of the mound. "Thinking
this very probable," says Sir Robert, "I took out
my glass to examine, and soon distinguished that
the causes of our alarm were two or three majestic
lions, taking the air upon the height of the pyramid.
Perhaps I had never seen so sublime a picture to
the mind, as well as to the eye. They were a species
of enemy which my party were accustomed to dread
without any panic fear; and while we continued to
advance, though slowly, the hallooing of the people
made the noble beasts gradually change their position,
till, in the course of twenty minutes, they
totally disappeared." The party then rode close to
the ruins, every now and then observing the broad
prints of feet the lions had left in the soil. This
naturally brought to Sir Robert's recollection that
part of the scriptures, wherein it is said, "Wild
beasts of the desert shall be there."</p>

<p>At a short distance from the Birs, and parallel
with its eastern face, is a mound, not inferior to that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
of the Kasr in elevation, but much longer than it is
broad. "On the top of it are two oratories," says
Mr. Rich. "One, called Mekam Ibrahim Khalib,
and said to be the place where Ibrahim was thrown
into the fire by order of Nemroud, who surveyed the
scene from the Birs; the other, which is in ruins,
Makam Saheb Zeman; but to what part of Mehdy's
life it relates, I am ignorant."</p>

<p>"They call it," says Sir R. Ker Porter, "'Babylon,
the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees'
excellency. The lady of kingdoms, given to pleasure,
that dwelleth carelessly, and sayeth in her heart,
<i>I am,</i> and there is none else beside me!' But now,
in the same expressive language, we may say, 'She
sits as a widow on the ground. There is no more a
throne for thee, O daughter of the Chaldeans!'
And for the abundance of the country, it has vanished
as clean away as if 'the besom of desolation' had,
indeed, swept it from north to south; the whole
land, from the outskirts of Bagdad to the farthest
stretch of the sight, lying a melancholy corpse."</p>

<p>Round the Birs are traces of ruins to a considerable
extent; and near the town of Hillah there are
several remarkable places; but as they do not bear
any very particular relation to Babylon, we here
close our account, entirely agreeing with Mr. Rich,
that it is evident, from what remains of that celebrated
city, and even from the most favourable
account handed down to us, that the public edifices
which adorned it were remarkable more for vastness
of dimensions than elegance of design, and solidity of
fabric than beauty of execution.</p>

<p>Though Babylon has universally been considered
as the largest city that ever existed on the earth,
there are some and even very good reasons to believe,
that it was never so large as Nineveh. "It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
intended, indeed," says one of the historians, "that
Babylon should have exceeded Nineveh in every
thing; but Nebuchadnezzar did not live long enough,
nor the Babylonish empire last long enough, to finish
the scheme that had been drawn of it." The houses
were not contiguous, but all built with a void space
on each side between house and house, so that the
larger part was not built upon. The houses of
Nineveh, however, were contiguous. Nineveh, also,
had a greater population; for, in the time of Jonah,
it had one hundred and twenty thousand souls,
"who could nor did not know their right hand
from their left." That is, one hundred and twenty
thousand infants<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>. But though Nineveh was the
oldest city and the largest, Babylon has in all subsequent
ages enjoyed the greatest celebrity<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>.</p>

</p>

<p>These lines lead us to some beautiful observations
by Sir John Malcolm:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Among the traces of a great nation's former
glory," says he, "there is none upon which the mind
dwells with more serious thought than on the magnificent
ruins of its ancient palaces. How forcibly
are we reminded of our condition, when told that an
edifice, in the erection of which a kingdom's wealth
had been exhausted; which was adorned with every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
ornament that the art of the world could supply, and
whose history was engraven on the imperishable
rocks with which it was constructed, was not only
fallen into decay, but that its founder was unknown,
and the language in which its history was inscribed
was no longer numbered among the tongues of man!"
These observations are peculiarly applicable to the
present state of Balbec.</p>

<p>This city stood in the road between Tyre and Palmyra;
its history is, nevertheless, so lost in obscurity,
that, considering the splendour and magnificence
of its remains, we are astonished! Scarcely any thing
of its history is known; and even its existence appears
to have been unknown for many centuries to
the Romans.</p>

<p>Tradition states that it was built by Solomon; and
for the truth of this the Jews quote the following
passage from the Book of Chronicles<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>:&mdash;"Also he
(Solomon) built Beth-horon the upper, and Beth-horon
the nether, fencied cities, with walls, gates,
and bars; and <i>Baal-ath</i>."</p>

<p>For the greater confirmation, it is thought that
Balbec is meant when Solomon says&mdash;"the tower of
Lebanon, that looketh towards Damascus." The
Arabs go even so far as to assert, that this city was
built by the king as a residence for the Queen of
Sheba; and Sir William Ouseley quotes a passage,
wherein it is mentioned that a tradition in Persian
implies, that Solomon often passed his day at Balbec,
and his night at Istakr.</p>

<p>The names Heliopolis and Balbec are words of
different languages, which have nearly the same signification.
The sun was worshipped by the ancient
inhabitants of the country, under the name of Baal.
Balbec signifies the vale of Baal; and Heliopolis the
city of the sun.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>That Balbec derived, not only its religion, but its
very name, from Heliopolis in Egypt, is rendered
certain by a passage in Macrobius:&mdash;"In the city
called Heliopolis, the Assyrians worship the sun with
great pomp, under the name of the Heliopolitan
Jove; and the statue of this god was brought
from a city in Egypt, also called Heliopolis, where
Senumens or Senepos reigned over the Egyptians, by
Opios, ambassador from Delebor, king of the Assyrians,
together with some Egyptian priests, of whom
Partemetis was the chief, and it remained long
among the Assyrians before it was removed to
Heliopolis."</p>

<p>The same author adds, "that he declines giving
the reason for this fact, or telling how the statue was
afterwards brought to the place, where in his time it
was worshipped, more according to the Assyrian
than the Egyptian rites, as circumstances foreign to
his purpose."</p>

<p>As Balbec has never been the seat of a monarch,
antiquaries are greatly at a loss to conceive how the
expense of these magnificent structures could have
been supplied by private or municipal liberality.
The orientals, however, explain the prodigy by a
never-failing expedient,&mdash;they were constructed by
the fairies or genii!</p>

<p>That these temples did not exist when Pompey
went through Heliopolis to Damascus is probable,
because the writers of that time, who mention less
remarkable structures with admiration, take no notice
of any such building; and it is certain that they
did exist in the time of Caracalla; because Heliopolis
is to be seen on many of his coins; and vows in
favour of him and his empress are recorded in two
inscriptions, the remains of which are still to be seen
on the pedestals of the columns of the great portico
of the temple.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>That Heliopolis was constituted a colony by Augustus
C&aelig;sar, is rendered probable, by some medals
which still remain, and in which it is called, "Colonia
Julia Augusta;" but it was not till the time of
Septimius Severus that the temple was impressed on
the reverse of the coins.</p>

<p>When we consider the extraordinary magnificence
of the temple of Balbec, we cannot but be greatly
surprised at the silence of the Greek and Roman
authors in respect to it. Mr. Wood, who has carefully
examined all the ancient authors, has found no
mention of it, except in a fragment of John of
Antioch, surnamed Malala, who attributes the building
of it to Antoninus Pius. His words are:&mdash;
"&AElig;lius Antoninus Pius<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> built a great temple at
Heliopolis, near Libanus, in Ph&#339;nicia, which was
one of the wonders of the world." Some Roman
medals also have been found, upon the reverse of
which is a representation something similar to those
temples, with the inscription:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Colonia Heliopolitana
Jovi Optimo Maximo Heliopolitano</span>.</p>

<p>One circumstance, however, militates against the
idea that Antoninus Pius was the builder of these
temples; viz., that Julius Capitolinus says nothing
about them, though he gives a list of that
emperor's buildings, and speaks of others of much
less consideration. It must, however, be remembered,
that the work of Julius Capitolinus is known to
be so extremely defective, that though Antoninus
reigned one-and-twenty years, and transmitted to
posterity the character of one of the best princes that
ever ruled, yet the particulars, that merited such
extraordinary praise, are utterly unknown.</p>

<p>Gibbon thus remarks upon the different fortunes
of Balbec and Emesa:&mdash;"Among the cities which
are enumerated by Greek and oriental names in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
geography and conquest of Syria, we may distinguish
<span class="smcap">Emesa</span> and <span class="smcap">Heliopolis</span>; the former as a metropolis
of the plain; the latter as the metropolis of the
valley. Under the last of the C&aelig;sars they were
strong and populous; the turrets glittered from afar;
an ample space was covered with public and private
buildings; and the citizens were illustrious by their
spirit, or at least by their pride; by their riches, or
at least by their luxury. In the days of paganism,
both Emesa and Heliopolis were addicted to the
worship of Baal, or the sun: but the decline of their
superstition or splendour has been marked by a singular
variety of fortune. Not a vestige remains of
the temple of Emesa, which was equalled in poetic
style to the summits of Mount Libanus; while the
ruins of Balbec, invisible to the writers of antiquity,
excite the curiosity and wonder of European travellers."</p>

<p>In the reign of Heraclius its garrison was strengthened,
that it might be enabled to withstand the
Arabs; and when Christianity gained the ascendancy
under Constantine, he shut up many pagan temples;
but it was Theodosius, who converted its temple into
a Christian church, the walls of which are still
standing. The conversion of it into a fortress was
the work of the Caliphs, when this part of the
world fell under the government of the Caliphs,
called the Ommiades; an incurious and therefore an
ignorant race, during whose time nothing is recorded
of Balbec, although it was then a considerable city.
The ancient name, Balbec, during this time was restored,
instead of Heliopolis, which was probably a
translation of Balbec, or at least substituted for it,
when it passed out of the possession of its own native
oriental inhabitants.</p>

<p>In Ebn Haukal's<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> oriental geography, Balbec is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
mentioned thus:&mdash;"Beyond the borders of Demeshk
is Baalbek, situated on an eminence. Here are the
gates of palaces, sculptured in marble; and lofty
columns, also of marble. In the whole region of
Syria there is not a more stupendous or considerable
edifice than this<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>."</p>

<p>The approach to this ruined city is thus described
by Mr. Bruce:&mdash;"The form of Mount Libanus,
as seen from the plain of Bekka, is this: first,
a range of mountains, extremely proper for culture,
and of no considerable height, sloping easily to
the plain, and covered with trees that are not very
thickly planted. On the other side of these rises a
chain of mountains of an extraordinary height, bare
for the most part, and stony, cut in every rain, and
covered with snow, except in summer. Thus they
continue till they descend much more steeply on the
other side towards the sea. The valleys within this
high chain of mountains, which on one side run parallel
with the sea-coast, and on the other form the
east side of the plain of Bekka, are mostly narrow;
but abundantly fertile, were they in the hands of
better people, under a better government; industry
being here always followed by oppression."</p>

<p>Mr. Carne describes his arrival thus:&mdash;"The sun
set on the vast temple, and the mountains around it,
with indescribable grandeur; the chain of Anti-Libanus,
in front, was covered with snow; and the
plain, wild and beautiful, stretched at its feet farther
than the eye can reach: the pigeons, of many-coloured
plumage, flew in clusters round the ruined walls, at
whose feet were a variety of trees and flowers,
amidst which ran a clear and rapid stream."</p>

<p>We now pass to Mons. La Martine:&mdash;"On reaching
the summit of the breach, we knew not where to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
fix our eyes. On every side we beheld marble doors
of prodigious dimensions, windows and niches, bordered
with exquisite sculpture, richly ornamented
arches, fragments of cornices, entablatures, and capitals.
The master-work of art; the wrecks of ages,
lay scattered as thickly as the grains of dust beneath
our feet. All was mystery, confusion, inexplicable
wonder. No sooner had we cast an admiring
glance on one side, than some new prodigy attracted
us on the others. Every attempt, we made to interpret
the religious meaning of the monuments, was
immediately defeated by some newly-discerned object.
We frequently groped about in this labyrinth
of conjecture. One cannot restrict, in one's fancy, the
sacred edifices of an age, or a people of whose religion
or manners nothing certain can be known.
Time carries his secrets away with him, and leaves
his enigmas as sports for human knowledge. We
speedily renounced all our attempts to build any
system out of these ruins; we were content to gaze
and admire, without comprehending any thing beyond
the colossal power of human genius; and the strength
of religious feeling, which had moved such masses
of stone, and wrought so many master-pieces."</p>

<p>The ruins of Balbec do not present a crowd of
fallen edifices, spread over a large extent, like those
of Palmyra; they consist only of three distinct buildings,
which stand not far from each other, in a plain
at a short distance from the inhabited part of the
town. As in the instance of Palmyra, where we
shall have to make a similar remark, it is impossible
to convey an adequate idea of these works of art,
without the accompaniments of plates<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>. We adopt,
therefore, an abstract of the account of M. Volney,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
since his description is, perhaps, the best that we
have:&mdash;"In entering the principal gate, which faces
the mountain on the east, we come to an hexagonal
court, which is one hundred and eighty feet in diameter.
This is strewed with broken columns, mutilated
capitals, and the remains of entablatures and
cornices. Around it is a row of ruined edifices, which
display all the ornaments of the richest architecture.
On passing through this court towards the west, we
enter a large square, three hundred and fifty feet
wide, and three hundred and thirty-three in length.
Along each side of this court runs a sort of gallery,
divided into various compartments, seven of which
may be reckoned in each of the principal wings. It
is not easy to conceive the use of this part of the
structure; but it does not diminish our admiration
at the beauty of the pilasters, and the richness of the
frieze and entablature; neither is it possible to avoid
remarking the singular effect which results from the
mixture of the garlands, the large foliage of the capitals,
and the sculpture of wild plants, with which they
are every where ornamented. At the west end of this
court stand six enormous columns, which appear to
be totally unconnected with the rest of the building.
On a more attentive examination, however, we discover
a series of foundations, which seem to mark out
the peristyle of a grand temple, to which these columns
belonged. Pococke supposes this temple never
to have been finished. We must examine them narrowly
before we can conceive all the boldness of the
elevation, and the richness of their workmanship.
Their shafts are twenty-one feet eight inches in circumference,
and fifty-eight high; so that the total
height, including the entablature, is from seventy-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>one
to seventy-two feet. These six pillars are all
that now remain of twenty-four<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>.</p>

<p>The southern side of the grand temple has, at
some distant period, been blocked up to build a
smaller one, the peristyle and walls of which are still
remaining. This temple presents a side of thirteen
columns by eight in front, which, like all the rest of
the ruins, are of the Corinthian order<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>. To reach
the smaller temple from the larger one, you must
cross trunks of columns, heaps of stone, and a ruinous
wall. After surmounting these obstacles, you arrive
at the gate, where you may survey the enclosure,
which was once the habitation of a god; but instead
of the awful scene of a prostrate people, and sacrifices
offered by a multitude of priests, the sky, which is
open from the falling in of the roof, only lets in light<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
to show a chaos of ruins covered with dust and
weeds. The walls, which supported the roof, are
thirty-one feet high, and without a window. There
are tablets in the form of lozenges, on which are
represented Jupiter seated on his eagle, Leda caressed
by the swan, Diana with her bow and crescent,
and several busts which seem to be figures of
emperors and empresses.</p>

<p>The number of lizards to be seen is so great, that
Mr. Bruce says, that those he saw one day in the
great court of the temple of the sun amounted to
many thousands; the ground, the walls, and stones
of the ruined buildings being covered with them.
Besides these two, there is a smaller temple of very
great beauty. The building itself, exclusive of the
pillars, by which it is surrounded, is only thirty-two
feet in diameter; and the height is divided into two
parts, in the lower of which the architecture is Ionic,
and in the higher Corinthian. The grace and lightness
of the exterior of this edifice has induced several
competent critics to call it "a perfect gem of art."</p>

<p>In respect to the six columns, "In order to
reach them," says M. de La Martine, "we had to
pass external boundary walls, high pedestals, terraces,
and foundations of altars. At length we
arrived at the feet of the columns. Silence is the
only language of man, when what he feels outstrips
the ordinary measure of his impressions. We stood
in mute contemplation of these six columns, and
scanning with our eyes their diameter, their elevation,
and the admirable sculpture of their architraves
and cornices. Their diameter is six feet, and their
height upwards of seventy-two. They are formed
out of two or three blocks, which are so perfectly
joined together, that the junction lines are scarcely
discernible<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>. They are composed of light yellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
stone, presenting a sort of medium between the
polish of marble and the deadness of turf. When
near them, the sun lighted them only on one side,
and we sat down for a few moments in their shade.
Large birds, like eagles, scared by the sound of our
footsteps, fluttered above the capitals of the columns,
where they have built their nests; and returning,
perched upon the acanthus of the columns, striking
them with their beaks, and flapping their wings
like living ornaments, amidst these inanimate wonders,
all of which appear to resemble works of
dwarfs."</p>

<p>Branching off to the southward of the <i>avenue</i>, you
come to the stumps of some fluted columns sticking
above the sand on either side of a small simple gateway;
and a few paces to the westward, on an eminence,
are the ruins of the small temple just now
mentioned; and from thence is enjoyed the magnificent
<i>coup-d'&#339;il</i> of all the ruins and the vast
desert.</p>

<p>Beyond the circular colonnade lie the prostrate
remains of a very magnificent building, constructed
of a species of marble superior to the generality of
that used in these ruins. The walls are constructed
of large single stones, nicely fitted one above another.
Richly ornamented windows extend around the
walls, and some columns of one entire piece, twenty-two
feet in length and about nine in circumference,
lie prostrate on the ground.</p>

<p>"About fifty yards distant from the temple," says
Mr. Maundrell, "is a row of Corinthian pillars, very
great and lofty, with a most stately architrave and
cornice at the top. This speaks itself to have been
part of some very august pile; but what one now
sees of it is but just enough to give a regret, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
there should be no more remaining. Here is another
curiosity of this place, which a man need be well
assured of his credit, before he ventures to relate, lest he
should be thought to strain the privilege of a traveller
too far. That which I mean is a large piece of
an old wall, which encompasses all these structures
last described. A wall made of such monstrous
great stones, that the natives hereabouts, (as it is
usual in things of this strange nature,) ascribe it to
the architecture of the devil. Three of the stones,
which were larger than the rest, we took the pains
to measure. We found them to extend sixty-one
yards in length; one twenty-one; the other two
each twenty yards; and in the breadth of the same
dimensions. These three stones lay in one and the
same row to the end; the rest of the wall was made
also of great stones, but none I think so great as
these. That which added to the wonder was, that
these stones were lifted up into the wall more than
twenty feet from the ground."</p>

<p>Besides these ruins, there are several very large
subterraneous passages, which lead under the great
citadel, immense vaults of very massive architecture,
constructed in a very beautiful manner. Some of
these, no doubt, were tombs; and this leads us to
remember, that Mr. Browne says<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>, that when he was
at Zahhl&eacute;, he met with a young man, a Druse, who
told him, that near Balbec, a few years ago, in
digging, the body of a man was found interred in a
kind of vault, having a piece of unstamped gold in
his mouth; near him a number of leaden plates
marked with characters, to them unknown. These
were sold and melted. La Martine says, that not far
from Balbec, in a valley of the Anti-Libanus, human
bones of immense magnitude have been discovered;
and that this fact is so confidently believed among the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
neighbouring Arabs, that the English consul in Syria
(Mr. Farren), a man of extensive information, proposes
to visit those mysterious sepulchres.</p>

<p>The walls of the ancient Heliopolis are traceable
in many directions, and show that the city must
have been of a very considerable extent. "These
walls," says Mr. Wood, "like most of the ancient
cities of Asia, appear to be the confused
patch-work of different ages. The pieces of capitals,
broken entablatures, and, in some places, reversed
Greek inscriptions, which we observed in walking
round them, convinced us that their last repairs
were made after the decline of taste, with materials,
negligently collected as they lay nearest to hand,
and hastily put together for immediate defence."</p>

<p>The stone of which the temple is built was brought
from the neighbouring quarry, at the bottom of
which there is a single stone lying seventy feet in
length, fourteen in breadth, and fourteen feet six
inches in thickness. Its weight, according to these
dimensions, must be above 1130 tons! It would
require, we are told, the united strength of sixty
thousand men of our time to raise this single stone!</p>

<p>The stones used at Balbec are the largest that
have ever been moved by human power. The largest
in the pyramids of Egypt do not exceed eighteen
feet. But here, of those that compose the sloping
wall, which surrounds the temple on the west and
north, three occupy a space of one hundred and
seventy-five feet and a half; viz., the 1st, fifty-eight
feet seven inches; the 2nd, fifty-eight feet eleven
inches; and the 3rd, exactly fifty-eight feet long;
and each of these is twelve feet thick.</p>

<p>"When it is considered," says La Martine, "that
some of these blocks of hewn granite are raised one
above another to the height of twenty or thirty feet
from the ground;&mdash;that they have been brought from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
distant quarries, and raised to so vast a height to
form the pavement of the temple;&mdash;the mind is overwhelmed
by such an example of human power. The
science of modern times cannot help us to explain it,
and we cannot be surprised, therefore, that it is
referred to the supernatural."</p>

<p>"The shades of evening," continues this accomplished
traveller, "which slowly descended the
mountains of Balbec, and obscured, one by one, the
columns and the ruins, imparted an additional air of
mystery to the picturesque and magical effect of
these wonderful works of man and time. We felt
the full insignificance of human nature; and while
contemplating the mass and eternity of these monuments,
we compared man to the swallows, which build
their nests for a season in the interstices of these
stones, without knowing for whom, or by whom, or
for what purpose, they were collected together. The
power which moved these masses, and accumulated
these blocks, is unknown to us. The dust of the
marble, which we trod under our feet, knows more
than we do, but can tell us nothing; and in a few
centuries to come, the generations who may, in their
turn, visit the wrecks of our monuments now existing,
will ask, without being able to answer, why
we laboured without being able to build and carve.
The works of man are more durable than his thoughts;
movement is the law of the human mind; the definite
is the dream of man's vanity and ignorance;
God is an object which incessantly recedes from us,
as we endeavour to approach him. We are continually
advancing, but we never arrive. The Deity,
whose divine figure man seems to embody in his
imagination, and to enshrine in his temples, continually
enlarges, and exceeds the narrow boundaries
of our minds, and our edifices; leaves the temples and
the altars to crumble into dust; and summons man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
to seek him where he is most plainly manifested,
viz., in intelligence, in virtue, in nature, and in
eternity."</p>

<p>We now give place to observations, made by travellers
on the relative merits of the architecture,
employed in these magnificent edifices. "When we
compare the ruins of Balbec," says Mr. Wood, "with
those of many ancient cities, which we visited in
Italy, Greece, and Egypt, and in other parts of
Asia, we cannot help thinking them the remains of
the boldest plan we ever saw attempted in architecture."</p>

<p>"The enormity of the scale," says Mr. Buckingham,
"and the magnificence of design, seen throughout
the whole of the architecture, with the boldness
of the drawing, and the exquisite finish of the sculpture,
impressed me with an idea of a labour more
than human. I should conceive that in no country
was to be found so superb a monument of the inimitable
perfection of ancient architecture. The
temples and the tombs of Egypt were here equalled
in the enormity of the masses, that composed them;
and the chamber of the Pyramids rivalled in the
closeness of the masonry; while the monuments of
Athens itself, in the age of Pericles and Praxiteles,
were at least equalled in the richness and beauty of
the sculptured ornaments, that adorned them. It
appeared to me, that the temples of Edfou, Tentyris,
and Thebes, fell far short of this, as a whole;
for here the ponderous strength of the Egyptian, and
the chastened elegance of the Grecian school, are
both most happily combined."</p>

<p>Mr. Addison appears to have entertained a different
opinion:&mdash;"Those ruins," says he, "though
so striking and magnificent, are yet, however, quite
second rate, when compared with the Athenian ruins;
and display, in their decorations, none of the bold con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>ceptions
and the genius which characterise the
Athenian architecture. There is a peculiar sameness
in the decorations of the figures, entablatures,
and cornices. The ornaments are all alike, and the
festoons of grapes, and vine-leaves hung on goats'
and horses' heads, the pendent bunches of grapes and
Cupids, however rich in appearance, and beautifully
chiselled, can never excite such feelings, as one small
portion of the Panathenian frieze of the Parthenon, or
one of the Metopes, representing a battle between a
Centaur and a Lapith&aelig;. There is a genius in these
latter, a combination of talent, a soul, fire, and
spirit, which are looked for in vain in the Balbec
remains. The great Panathenian frieze of the Parthenon,
which extended all around that temple, with
its hundreds of horses and warriors, its spirited
grouping, and faithful delineation of forms and attitudes;
and above it the wars of the Centaurs and
Lapith&aelig;, possessed a most exciting interest. The
vine-branches and wheat ears of the temple of Balbec,
although unquestionably very beautiful, yet
appear tame in comparison; and cannot certainly be
put in competition with these master-pieces of architectural
decoration."</p>

<p>"Several artists have observed," says Mr. Wood,
"a similitude between some European buildings, and
some parts of the ruins of Palmyra and Balbec; from
which they have, perhaps, too hastily concluded,
that the former were copied from the latter. The
portico of the Louvre at Paris has been compared
in this light to the ruins of Palmyra; as also with
the portico at Balbec; but we cannot discover any
foundation for inferences so injurious to the memory
of the architect, who built that noble structure, which
is as justly admired as it is unaccountably neglected."</p>

<p>We now return to the page of M. de La Martine:&mdash;"Round
this platform is ranged a series of chapels,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
decorated with niches, admirably sculptured, friezes,
cornices, and vaulted arches; all displaying the most
finished workmanship, but evidently belonging to a
degenerate period of art. But this impression can
only be felt by those whose eyes have been previously
exercised by the contemplation of the pure monuments
of Athens and Rome. Every other eye would
be fascinated by the splendour of the forms and the
finish of the ornaments. The only fault is too much
richness; the stone groans beneath the weight of its
own luxuriance, and the walls are overspread with a
lace-work of marble."</p>

<p>The town is, at present, so ruined, that there are
not counted more than fifty habitable dwellings in
it; though the whole number within the walls may
be estimated at five hundred.</p>

<p>The state of the city is deplorable. The emirs
of the house of Harfoushe had already greatly impaired
it, when an earthquake, in 1759, completed
its destruction; insomuch, that though in 1751 there
were five thousand inhabitants, not twelve hundred
are remaining; and all these poor, without industry
or commerce, we are told, and cultivating nothing
but a little cotton, some maize, and a few watermelons.</p>

<p>Even the ruins are altering every day. Dawkins
and Wood found nine large columns standing;
but Volney, in 1784, found only six. They
reckoned twenty-nine at the lesser temple; but
now there are only twenty. There were, originally,
thirty-four,&mdash;eight in front, and thirteen along each
of the sides. The others were overthrown by an
earthquake. Nature alone, however, has not effected
this devastation. The Turks have had their share in
the destruction of the columns; the motive for which
was merely that of procuring the iron cramps, which
served to join the several blocks of which each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
column is composed. Famine, the pestilence, and
the sword, gradually thinned the inhabitants. The
population of five thousand, which the town contained
in 1751, has now dwindled down to barely
two hundred persons: nor does each house continue
to possess, as it did in the time of Maundrell, "ten
or fifteen cows, besides goats and sheep, the goats being
of an uncommon species, worth from 30<i>l.</i> to 35<i>l.</i> a
piece!" The description left by Maundrell was faithful
at the time he visited those ruins; but since that
period several important parts have been destroyed,
and even the place of the temple at the end of the great
court, which was probably the principal edifice of
the whole, cannot at this day be made out<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>.</p>

<p>The hands of the natives have, no doubt, committed
many ravages. Faccardine, prince of the
Druses, destroyed or injured several parts of these
ruins; but when he afterwards visited Italy, and
contracted a taste for its architecture, he is said
to have bitterly lamented the sacrilege he had committed
at Balbec<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>. "It is in fact man, not nature,"
says an elegant writer, "that has wrought this
change. No blight has seared the soil, or poisoned
the air, but a degrading despotism has as effectually
dried up the sources of social prosperity, as if some
elementary convulsion had suddenly turned the clime
of beauty cold and dark, and struck the teeming
earth with hopeless barrenness. Indeed, Turkish
oppression has done what no unkindness of nature
could have effected. The splendours of Palmyra
rose, under the breath of a free commerce, in the
midst of a sandy desert; but nothing has been able
to preserve that and many other great cities from
crumbling into heaps of ruins, at the death-touch of
the gloomy tyranny, that now hangs like a pall over
the land."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>We must now give place to what Mons. de La
Martine says, in regard to the Bishop of Balbec:&mdash;"We
proceeded very little farther that day. The
road diverged from these ruins, and led us to others.
We passed over some vaults, and arrived at a small
house. This was the palace of the Bishop of Balbec,
who, clothed in his violet-coloured pelisse, and attended
by some Arab peasants, advanced to meet us,
and conducted us to his humble door. The poorest
peasant's cottage in Burgundy, or Auvergne, possesses
greater luxury and elegance than the palace of
the Bishop of Balbec. It was an ill-built hut, without
either window or door, and through the decayed
roof the rain worked its way, and dropped on the
mud floor. This was the bishop's dwelling! But at
the further end of the yard, which adjoined the
house, a neat wall, newly built of blocks of stone,
and a door and window in ogives of Moorish architecture,
each ogive being constructed of finely-sculptured
stones, attracted my attention. This was the
church of Balbec, the cathedral of that town, in
which other gods have had splendid temples; the
chapel in which the few Arab Christians, who live
here amidst the wrecks of so many different faiths,
worship, under a purer form, the universal Creator."</p>

<p>The bishop was a fine old man with hair and beard
of silver, a grave and benevolent cast of features, and
a sweet and well-modulated voice. He was the
perfect image of a priest of poetry or romance, says
the traveller; and his aspect, which denoted peace,
resignation, and charity, was well suited to the
scene of ruins and meditation in which he lived.</p>

<p>The traveller afterwards describes a delightful
scene. He and his friends were sitting by moonlight
near the bishop's hut. "We were silent. Suddenly
a soft plaintive strain, a slow modulated
murmur stole through the grotesque ogives of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
ruined wall of the bishop's house. This vague and
confused sound swelled higher and higher, until we
distinguished it to be a chant from the united voices
of choristers; a monotonous, melancholy strain, which
rose, fell, and died away, and was alternately revived
and re-echoed. This was the evening prayer, which
the Arab bishop was chanting with his little flock, in
the skeleton of that which once had been his church;
viz., a heap of ruins piled up by a heap of idolaters.
We were totally unprepared for music of this sort,
where every note was, in fact, a sentiment or a sign
from the human breast. How little did we expect it
in this solitude, in the bosom of the desert, issuing, as
it were, from mute stones, strewed about by the combined
influence of earthquakes, barbarous ignorance,
and time! A hallowed emotion inspired us, and we
joined with religious fervour in the sacred hymn,
until the last sighs of the pious voices had died away,
and silence again reigned over the venerable ruins."</p>

<p>We conclude with the words which Seller
in his history of Palmyra adopts from Cicero:
"Whenever we see such remains of venerable antiquity,
such lasting records of the names and achievements
of great persons, we are admonished to take
care so to regulate our actions, that we may convince
the world we have settled our prospect upon the
rewards of future ages, and not on the flatteries of
the present; and so remember, that monuments being
erected to the memory of those who have lived well
in this world before they left it, put us in mind, that
there is nothing here permanent and immutable; and
that it is the duty of considering man to aspire
towards immortality<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>."</p>

<p>"On which side soever," says an elegant traveller,
"you approach Constantinople, whether ascending
by the Dardanelles and the sea of Marmora, or descending
from the Black Sea by the Bosphorus;
whether you arrive by crossing the plain of Thrace,
or come in sight from the opposite hills of Asia, she
presents herself, indeed, like 'the queen of cities.'"</p>

<p>The history of this city being that of an empire,
we shall confine ourselves to a few particulars, and
then pass on to give some account of its monumental
antiquities. We do this the more readily, since those
antiquities are far from being of the first order.</p>

<p>According to Ammianus, Byzantium was founded
by the Athenians; according to Justin, by the Laced&aelig;monians;
according to Paterculus, by the Milesians;
according to others, by a colony of Megara,
under the conduct of Byzas, 658 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small></p>

<p>Byzantium received a great accession of inhabitants
in consequence of a decree passed, in gratitude
to the Athenians, for having compelled Philip of
Macedon to raise the siege of their city<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>In subsequent times Constantine the Great (from
whom it was called Constantinople), seeing its proud
situation, created it into a capital jointly with Rome;
from which time the Roman empire was distinguished
by the titles Eastern and Western. In this
position it stood, till the city was sacked by the Turks
under the guidance of Mahomet the Second.</p>

<p>The manner in which the Turks first gained a
footing in Europe is thus described in Bucke's Harmonies
of Nature:&mdash;"Orcan having made himself
master of the shore skirting the sea that separated
Asia from Europe, his son Solyman resolved, if
possible, to gain the castle of Hanni (Sestos), then
considered the key of Europe: but the Turks had
neither pilot, ships, nor boats. Solyman stood
meditating on the beach, one fine moonlight night,
for some time. He had come thither with about
eighty followers on a hunting expedition. Beholding
the towers of Hanni rising over the opposite shore,
he resolved to secure them for his father and himself.
He communicated his thoughts to his followers.
Wondering at his resolution, they regarded him as
frantic. He persisted;&mdash;and they made three rafts
fastened on corks and bladders of oxen. When the
party had finished their task, they committed themselves
to the waters; and with poles instead of oars,
succeeded in gaining the opposite shore: the moon
shining brilliantly as they stepped off the rafts, almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
immediately under the walls of Hanni. As they
marched along the beach, they met a peasant going
to his work, it being now morning. This man hated
his prince; and being bribed by a sum of money, he
told Solyman of a subterranean passage leading into
the castle. The little band availed themselves of this
information, and quietly entered the walls. There was
no regular garrison, and the few inhabitants were
still asleep. They fell an easy prey, therefore, to the
adventurers. Having thus gained the first object of
their enterprise, they assembled the pilots and vessel-owners
of the town; and, offering them considerable
sums of money, induced them to steer their vessels
to the opposite shore. Some thousand men were
then embarked, and in a few hours they were wafted
under the castle walls. This was the first landing of
the Turks in Europe: they ever after kept possession
of this castle: ninety-six years after, they sacked the
city of Constantinople."</p>

<p>Mahomet II.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>, surnamed "the Great," was born
at Adrianople in the year 1430, and was, in the
thirteenth year of his age, called to the throne by the
voluntary abdication of his father, Amurath II. On
his accession, Mahomet renewed the peace with the
Greek emperor Constantine, to whom he, at the
same time, agreed to pay a pension for the expenses
and safe custody of his uncle Orcan, who had, at a
previous period, withdrawn to the court of Constantinople
for safety. The carelessness of the sultan in
the observance of this clause of the treaty excited
the complaints of the emperor, with the imprudent
threat that, unless the pension was regularly paid, he
would no longer detain Orcan. This threat afforded
the sultan a pretext for rekindling the war. Mahomet
determined to complete the conquest of the
feeble empire by the capture of Constantinople; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
to terminate, by one terrible catastrophe, the strife
of many ages between the Moslems and the Greeks.
Every preliminary measure having been completed,
Mahomet at length appeared before Constantinople,
on the 2d of April, 1453, at the head of three hundred
thousand men; supported by a formidable artillery,
and by a fleet of three hundred and twenty sail,
mostly store-ships and transports; but including
eighteen galleys of war, while the besieged could not
muster more than ten thousand effective soldiers for
the defence. This vast disparity of force leaves little
room for admiring the prowess and military skill of
the victorious party. The besieged made, however,
so obstinate a defence, under the brave emperor,
Constantine Pal&aelig;ologus, that for fifty-three days all
the efforts of the assailants were unavailing. The
defenders of the city had drawn strong iron chains
across the entrance of the port; and Mahomet saw,
that unless he could get some of his vessels into the
Golden Horn, his success was doubtful, and that,
at best, the defence might be greatly protracted. He,
therefore, contrived to conduct a part of his fleet, for
ten miles, over the land on a sort of railway, from
the Bosphorus into the harbour, and caused a floating
battery to be constructed and occupied with
cannon. This sealed the fate of the imperial city.</p>

<p>On the day of the last assault, Mahomet said to
his soldiers:&mdash;"I reserve to myself only the city;
the gold and women are yours." The emperor (Constantine)
accomplished all the duties of a general and
a soldier. The nobles, who fought around his person,
sustained, till their last breath, the honourable names
of Pal&aelig;ologus and Cantacuzene. His mournful exclamation
was heard&mdash;"Cannot there be found a
Christian to cut off my head?" and his last fear was,
lest he should fall alive into the hands of his enemies.
He threw away his imperial dress, rushed into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
thickest of the fight, fell by an unknown hand, and
his body was buried under a mountain of the slain:
nor was it afterwards recognised.</p>

<p>The houses and convents were deserted; and the
trembling inhabitants flocked together in the streets,
like a herd of timid animals. From every part of the
city they rushed into the church of St. Sophia. In
the space of an hour the sanctuary, the choir, the
nave, the upper and lower galleries, were filled with
the multitude of fathers and husbands, of women and
children, of priests, monks, and religious virgins; the
doors were barred on the inside, and they sought
protection from the sacred dome, which they had so
lately abhorred as a profaned and polluted edifice.</p>

<p>The doors were, soon after, broken with axes; and
the Turks encountering no resistance, their bloodless
hands were employed in selecting and securing the
multitude of their prisoners. Youth, beauty, and
the appearance of youth, attracted their choice. In
the space of an hour, the male captives were bound
with cords, the females with their veils and girdles.
The senators were linked with their slaves; the prelates
with the porters of their church; and young
men of a plebeian class with noble maids, whose
faces had been invisible to the sun and their nearest
kindred.</p>

<p>In this common captivity the ranks of society
were confounded; the ties of nature were cut asunder;
and the inexorable soldier was careless of the father's
groan, the tears of the mother, and the lamentations
of the children. The loudest in their wailings were
the nuns, who were torn from the altars with naked
bosoms, outstretched hands, and dishevelled hair.
At a similar hour, a similar rapine was exercised in
all the churches and monasteries; in all the palaces
and habitations of the capital. The male captives
were bound with cords, and the females with their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
veils and girdles, and driven, to the number of
sixty thousand, from the city to the camp or fleet,
where those, who could not obtain the means of purchasing
their ransom, were exchanged, or sold, according
to the caprice or interest of their masters.</p>

<p>The disorder and rapine lasted till the sultan
entered in triumph through the gate of St. Romanus.
He was attended by his vizirs, his bashaws, and
guards. As he rode along, he gazed with satisfaction
and wonder on the strange, though splendid,
appearance of the domes and palaces, so dissimilar
to the style of oriental architecture. He proceeded
to the church of St. Sophia; where, observing a soldier
in the act of breaking up the marble pavement,
he admonished him with his scymetar, that if the
spoil and captives were granted to the soldiers, the
public and private buildings had been reserved for
the prince.</p>

<p>From St. Sophia he proceeded to the august, but
desolate, mansion of a hundred successors of the first
Constantine; but which, in a few hours, had been
stripped of the pomp of royalty. A melancholy
reflection on the vicissitudes of human greatness
forced itself upon his mind, and he repeated an elegant
distich of Persian poetry:&mdash;"The spider has
wove his web in the imperial palace; and the owl
hath sung her watch-song on the towers of Afrasiel<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>."</p>

<p>"The finest point from which Constantinople can
be viewed," says M. de La Martine, "is from a belvidere,
built by M. Truqui, on the terrace roof of his
house. This belvidere commands the entire group
of the hills of Pere-Galata, and the little hillocks
which surround the port on the front side of the
water. It is the eagle's flight over Constantinople
and the sea. Europe, Asia, the entrance of the
Bosphorus, and the sea of Marmora, are all under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
the eye at once. The city lies at the feet of the
spectator. If (continues Mons. de La Martine) we
were allowed to take only one point of the earth,
this would be the one to choose. Whenever I ascend
to the belvidere to enjoy this view (and I do so
several times a day, and invariably every evening),
I cannot conceive how, of the many travellers who
have visited Constantinople, so few have felt the
beauty which it presents to my eye and to my mind.
Why has no one described it? Is it because words
have neither space, horizon, nor colours, and that
painting is only the language of the eye? But painting
itself has never portrayed all that is here. The
pictures, I have seen, are merely detached scenes, consisting
of a few lines and colours without life: none
convey any idea of the innumerable gradations of
tint, varying with every change of the atmosphere,
and every passing hour. The harmonious whole, and
the colossal grandeur of these lines; the movements
and the intertwinings of the different horizons; the
moving sails, scattered over the three seas; the murmur
of the busy population on the shores; the reports of
the cannon on board the vessels, the flags waving
from the mast-heads; the floating caiques; the vaporous
reflection of domes, mosques, steeples, and
minarets in the sea; all this has never been described;"&mdash;nor
ever can be!</p>

<p>The whole circuit of Constantinople, however, calculated
at somewhat more than twelve miles, present, even
to diligent research<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>, very few remains of antiquity.
The truth is, the Turks have availed themselves of
the marbles and fragments of the Greeks in the construction
of their own public edifices; and the antiquities
of Constantinople are re-produced to the eye
under entirely different forms and constructions, in
the mosques and minarets, the fountains and cemeteries
of the Osmandys. Many a beautiful work, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the ancient Greek chisel, has thus been embedded in
a wall, or cut down and defaced to make a Turkish
tombstone; and many an edifice, constructed in accordance
with the pure styles of architecture, has
been levelled and used as a quarry. But still, it
must be confessed that some of the Turkish buildings,
and more particularly some of the imperial
mosques which have risen in their places, are distinguished
by grandeur and beauty. Of these imperial
mosques there are fourteen, each lofty, and magnificent
in its general dimensions, and built from base
to dome with excellent and enduring materials;
chiefly of white marble, tinged with grey. Besides
these, there are sixty ordinary mosques, varying in
size and beauty, but all considerable edifices; and
then two hundred and more inferior mosques and
messdgids<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>.</p>

<p>The walls of Byzantium<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> were built of large square
stones, so joined as, apparently, to form one single
block. They were much loftier on the land side than
towards the water, being naturally defended by the
waves, and in some places by the rocks they are built
on, which project into the sea.</p>

<p>They were of Cyclopian structure<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>; and of the
workmanship, from what Herodian has said of them,
the masonry was greatly superior to any of the workmanship
now visible in the fortifications. It was surrounded
by a wall, made of such immense quadrangular
masses of stone, and so skilfully adjusted, that
the marvellous masonry, instead of disclosing to view
the separate parts of which it consisted, seemed like
one entire mass. "The very ruins," says Herodian,
"show the wonderful skill, not only of the persons
who built it, but of those, also, by whom it was
dismantled."</p>

<p>The wall of Theodosius begins at the castle of
Seven Towers, whence it traverses the whole western<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
side of the city. This is the only part of the general
wall of the city worth seeing. It is flanked into a
double row of mural towers, and defended by a fosse
about eight yards wide. The same promiscuous
mixture of the works of ancient art&mdash;columns, inscriptions,
bas-reliefs, &amp;c.&mdash;seen in the walls of all
the Greek cities, is here remarkably conspicuous.
But the ivy-mantled towers, and the great height of
this wall, added to its crumbling ruinous state, give
it a picturesque appearance, exhibited by no other
city in the Levant: it resembles a series of old
ruined castles extending for five miles from sea to
sea<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>.</p>

<p>Of the eighteen gates, which once existed on the
west side of the city, only seven now remain. The
site of the two temples erected by Justinian, as
<i>safeguards</i> of the city, may still be ascertained by
their vestiges; but these have almost disappeared.</p>

<p>The walls, which are well built, are still standing,
and consist of stone terraces from fifty to sixty feet
high, and occasionally from fifteen to twenty feet thick,
covered with freestone of a greyish-white colour; but
sometimes of pure white, and seeming fresh from the
chisel of the mason. At the feet of the walls are the
ancient fosses filled with rubbish and luxuriant loam,
in which trees and pellitories have taken root ages ago,
and now form an impenetrable glacis. The summit
of the wall is almost everywhere crowned with vegetation,
which overhangs and forms a sort of coping,
surmounted by capital and volute of climbing plants
and ivy. These walls are so noble, that La Martine
says that, next to the Parthenon and Balbec, they
are the noblest existing memorials of ruined empires.</p>

<p>"There is nothing either grand or beautiful in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
the remains of the brazen column, consisting of the
bodies of three serpents twisted spirally together. It is
about twelve feet in height, and being hollow, the
Turks have filled it with broken tiles, stones, and
other relics. But in the circumstances of its history,
no critique of ancient times can be more interesting.
For it once supported the golden tripod at
Delphi, which the Greeks, after the battle of Plat&aelig;a,
found in camp of Mardonius<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>."</p>

<p>Near the Valide is a <span class="smcap">column</span> of <span class="smcap">porphyry</span><a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>,
generally supposed to have supported the statue of
<span class="smcap">Constantine</span>. It is composed of eight pieces, surrounded
by as many wreaths or garlands of the same
marble. Not long since it gained the name of Colonna
Brugiata, or burned pillar, having been very
much defaced by the many conflagrations to which
this vast city has been subject.</p>

<p>Near Mesmer-Kiosch<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> is a view of the summit
of the Corinthian pillar of white marble, fifty feet
high, in the gardens of the seraglio, with the inscription&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><small>
FORTUN&AElig; REDUCI OB DEVICTOS GOTHOS.<br />
</small></p>

<p class="noidt">This has been erroneously supposed the column of
Theodora. Pococke mentions that it was taken from
some other part of the town to the seraglio gardens.
It is supported by a handsome capital of verd
antique.</p>

<p>This building<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>, the mosque of St. Sophia (for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>merly
of much larger extent), owes its foundation to
the emperor Justinian, who lived also to see it
finished, <small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 557. It was dedicated by him to the
wisdom of God. This fabric is entirely Gothic.</p>

<p>"In the time of Procopius<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> its dome might have
seemed suspended by a chain from heaven; but at
present it exhibits much more of a subterranean
than of an aerial character. The approach to the
Pantheon at Rome, as well as to the spacious aisle
and dome of St. Peter's, is by ascending; but in
order to get beneath the dome of St. Sophia, the
spectator is conducted down a flight of stairs. * * *
The more we saw of the city, the more we had
reason to be convinced that it remains as it was from
its conquest by the Turks. The interior of St. Sophia
manifestly proves the indisposition of the Turks
towards the decoration of the buildings they found. * * *
There is so much of littleness and bad taste
in the patchwork of its interior decorations, and of
confusion in the piles and buttresses about it, when
viewed externally, that we hardly considered it more
worth visiting than some other mosques, especially
those of sultan Solyman and sultan Achmet."</p>

<p>This is one of the largest edifices ever built for the
purpose of Christian worship; but though built by
Constantine, it is evident, from the barbarous style
of art which pervades the mass of stone, that it is
the production of a vitiated and declining age. It is
a confused memorial of a taste which no longer
exists. "In its present state," says La Martine,
"St. Sophia resembles an immense caravansary of
God; for there are the columns of the temple of
Ephesus and the figures of the apostles, encircled
with gilded glories, looking down upon the hanging
lamps of the Iman."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>In the mosques, called Osmanic, are pillars of
Egyptian granite, twenty-two feet high and three
feet in diameter; and near it is the celebrated sarcophagus
of red porphyry, called the <i>Tomb of Constantine</i>,
nine feet long, seven feet wide, and five feet
thick, of one entire mass. In the mosque of sultan
Achmet are columns of verde antico, Egyptian granite,
and white marble. Several antique vases of
glass and earthenware are also there suspended,
exactly as they were in the temples of the ancients

<p>Near the mosque of sultan Achmet<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>, which is
one of the finest buildings in Constantinople, stands
the Hippodrome, called by the Turks Etmeidon,
which is no other than a translation of the ancient
name; it being made use of at present for exercising
cavalry.</p>

<p>It is a space of ground five hundred and seventy-four
yards in length, and one hundred and twenty-four
in breadth, and at one end are two obelisks, the
one of granite fifty-eight feet high, on which are inscribed
many Egyptian hieroglyphics. The pedestal
is adorned with bas-relievos of but ordinary sculpture,
representing different actions of the emperor
Theodosius in relation to the races that were performed
in the Hippodrome. In one place, particularly,
he is to be seen crowning a figure who is
supposed to be the person that had carried off the
prize.</p>

<p>The other obelisk is composed of several pieces of
stone, and seems, by many cavities between the
stones, to have been covered with brass plates; which,
together with its height, must have rendered it
superior to the former in magnificence. Between
these obelisks is the Delphic pillar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>The aqueduct of the Roman emperors still remains<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>.
It was first erected by Hadrian: it was called by
his name; subsequently it bore that of Valens, and
of Theodosius. Being ruined by the Avans in the
reign of Heraclius, it was repaired by one of the
Constantines. In a later period Solyman, called the
Magnificent, finding it gone to decay, caused it to be
restored. It consists of a double line of arches, built
with alternate layers of stone and brick.</p>

<p>Within the walls of Constantinople<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> the Greek
emperors had formed, by excavation, a number of
immense cisterns, or reservoirs, which were always
to be kept full, and which might supply the capital
in case of siege. One of them, though no longer
performing the office for which it was intended, is
still one of the curiosities of Constantinople, to which
all travellers are conducted. It is a vast subterranean
edifice, whose roof is supported by an immense
number of columns, each column being curiously
formed of three pillars placed one on the top of the
other. The Turks call it the place of the "thousand
and one columns"&mdash;not that the columns
are really so numerous&mdash;but because it is the
favourite number of the oriental nations. Though
the earth has, in part, filled it up, it is still of great
depth.</p>

<p>The whole cavity, according to Dr. Walsh, is capable
of containing 1,237,939 cubit feet of water when
full. It is now, however, dry; and a number of silk-twisters
have taken possession of it, and ply their
trade at the bottom in almost utter darkness. There
is another, also, which still exists as a cistern; which
Dr. Walsh, who first gave us any account of it,
describes as being a subterraneous lake, extending
under several streets, with an arched roof that covers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
and conceals it, supported on three hundred and
thirty-six magnificent pillars.</p>

<p>Some remains of a large antique structure are seen
on the side of the Hippodrome; and it has been conjectured
that this was the palace of the emperors;
others suppose it to have been part of the Basilica,
the form of which Gyllius believes to have been
quadrangular; in opposition to those who had described
it as an octagon. The Basilica was a college
for the instruction of youth. In the reign of Basilicus
there happened a great fire, and which consuming
whole streets, with many stately edifices,
wholly destroyed the Basilica, together with its
library, containing six hundred thousand volumes.
Amongst these curiosities there was a MS. of the
Iliad and Odyssey, written in letters of gold; upon
a serpents gut, one hundred and twenty feet in
length.</p>

<p>Wheler says that the Seven Towers do not look
strong enough for a castle; but sufficiently so for a
prison; which was the employment to which it was put
for great men, or great malefactors, like the Tower of
London. He was not permitted to enter into it; but
he observed that one of the gateways was adorned
with bassi-relievi, or oblong tablets of white marble.
One of these represented the fall of Phaeton;
another Hercules fighting with a bull; another
Hercules combating with Cerberus; and another,
Venus coming to Adonis during the time in which he
is sleeping.</p>

<p>The appearance of these walls, says Hobhouse,
(the work of the second Theodosius), is more venerable
than any other Byzantine antiquity; their
triple ranges rise one above the other in most places
nearly entire, and still retaining their ancient battlements
and towers, which are shaded with large trees,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>which spring from the fosse, and through the rents of
repeated earthquakes.</p>

<p>The intervals between the triple walls, which are
eighteen feet wide, are in many places choked up
with earth and masses of the fallen rampart; and the
fosse, of twenty-five feet in breadth, is cultivated and
converted into gardens and cherry orchards, with
here and there a solitary cottage. Such is the height
of the walls, that to those following the road under
them on the outside, none of the mosques or other
buildings of the capital, except the towers of Tekkun-Sana,
are visible; and as there are no suburbs, this
line of majestic ramparts, defenceless and trembling
with age, might impress upon the mind the notion,
that the Ottomans had not deigned to inhabit the
conquered city, but, carrying away its people into
distant captivity, had left it an unresisting prey to
the desolations of time.</p>

<p>The Seven Towers reminded La Martine of the
death of the first sultan, who was immolated by the
Janissaries. Othman was allured by them into the
castle, and perished two days afterwards by the hand
of the vizir Daoud. Shortly after, the vizir himself
was conducted to the Seven Towers. His turban was
torn off his head; he was made to drink at the same
fountain where the unfortunate Othman had slaked
his thirst; and he was strangled in the same chamber
in which he had strangled his master. "I have seen
the ruins of Athens, of Ephesus, and Delphi," says
Lord Byron; "I have traversed great part of Turkey;
and many other parts of Europe, and some of Asia;
but I never beheld a work of nature or art, which
yielded an impression like the prospect, on each side,
from the Seven Towers to the Golden Horn."</p>

<h2><a name="NO_XX_CAIRO_OLD" id="NO_XX_CAIRO_OLD"></a>NO. XX.&mdash;CAIRO (OLD).</h2>


<p>This city is said, by some, to have been founded
by Semiramis, when she invaded Egypt; others suppose
it to have been erected by the Persians under
Cambyses in the place where Latopolis formerly
stood. Strabo, however, asserts, that it was built by
some barbarians who had retired thither by permission
of their sovereign; and that in his time the
Romans kept in garrison there one of the three legions
that were kept in Egypt.</p>

<p>It is now called Fostat, and is situate between
Grand Cairo and the Nile. It succeeded Memphis
as the capital of Egypt; the history, therefore, of this
place merges in the general one of Egypt.</p>

<p>According to Elmanim in his history of the Arabs,
Amrou, son of Eleas, built Masr Fostat on the spot
where he had formed his camp previously to his
besieging Alexandria. The governors sent by the
caliphs afterwards made it their place of residence.
The situation on the banks of the Nile, and near to
land that communicated with the Red Sea, soon made
it very flourishing.</p>

<p>It was about two leagues in circumference, when,
five hundred years after its foundation, it was delivered
up by Schaonar, king of Egypt, in order to
prevent its falling under the French (during the
crusades), who set fire to it. The conflagration lasted
fifty-four days. The unfortunate inhabitants quitted
the ashes, and took refuge in New Cairo, which then
assumed the name of Masr, and the former one of
Fostat was lost.</p>

<p>Its environs are now scattered over with ruins,
which indicate its ancient extent; and which, were
history defective, would sufficiently attest it to be
comparatively modern. They want the majestic
character the Egyptians gave to their edifices, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
the impression of which time cannot efface. Neither
sphynx, column, nor obelisk, can be found among
those heaps of rubbish.</p>

<p>At this place, however, are still to be seen
Joseph's granaries; if this appellation may be given
to a large space of ground, surrounded by walls
twenty feet high, and divided into courts, without
any roof or covering. But the only things worth
seeing in the ancient Cairo are the castle, and the
aqueduct that conveys the water of the Nile into
the castle. It is supported by three hundred and
fifty narrow and very lofty arcades.</p>

<p>These are thus described by Rollin:&mdash;The castle of
Cairo is one of the greatest curiosities in Egypt. It
stands on the hill without the city, has a rock for its
foundation, and is surrounded with walls of a vast
height and solidity. You go up to the castle by a
way hewn out of the rock, and which is of so easy
ascent, that loaded horses and camels get up without
difficulty. The greatest rarity in this castle is
Joseph's Well; so called, either because the Egyptians
are pleased with ascribing their most remarkable
particulars to that great man, or because there is
really such a tradition in the country. This is a
proof, at least, that the work in question is very
ancient; and it is certainly worthy the magnificence
of the most powerful kings of Egypt. This well has,
as it were, two stories, cut out of a rock to a prodigious
depth. One descends to the reservoir of
water between the two wells by a staircase seven or
eight feet broad, consisting of two hundred and
twenty steps, and so contrived, that the oxen employed
to throw up the water, go down with all
imaginable ease; the descent being scarcely perceptible.
The well is supplied by a spring, which is
almost the only one in the whole country. The oxen
are continually turning a wheel with a rope, to which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
buckets are fastened. The water thus drawn from
the first and lowermost well is conveyed by a little
canal into a reservoir which forms the second well,
from whence it is drawn to the top in the same
manner, and then conveyed by pipes to all parts of
the castle.</p>

<p>The remains of Egyptian Babylon merit attention,
says Mr. Wilkinson; and, among other objects shown
by the monks, who live there, is a chamber of the Virgin,
the traditions concerning which have been treated
by the credulous with the same pious feelings as the
tree at Heliopolis. The station of Babylon is evidently
of Roman construction, and probably the
same that is mentioned by Strabo, in which one of
the three Roman legions was quartered. It formed
part of the town of Fostat, built by Amer, near the
ruins of Babylon, and the mosque, called after him,
marks the spot of his encampment, which subsequently
became the centre of the city he had founded.
The exterior of the Roman station still reminds us of
its former strength, which defied the attacks of the
Arab invaders for seven months, and its solid walls
still contain a village of Christian inhabitants. Over
the triangular pediment of the doorway, which is on
the south side, appears to have been an inscription,
long since removed; and in an upper chamber above
one of the bastions of this now-closed entrance, is an
old Christian record, sculptured on wood, of the time
of Dioclesian, which is curious from its material and
the state of its preservation.</p>

<p>Near Cairo are some ancient catacombs. These
are situated beneath a mound in the middle of a
plain, adjoining the pyramids of Saccara, which lies
beneath the sandy surface. Dr. Clarke ascended into
them by means of a rope-ladder. "The first chamber
he entered contained scattered fragments of mummies,
which had originally been placed on a shelf cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
out of the rock, and extending breast-high the whole
length of this apartment: there are two tiers or
stories of these chambers, one above the other, all
presenting the same appearance of violation and disorder,
and smelling very offensively. At some distance
from these, which were apparently appropriated
to man, are those in which the sacred birds and animals
were deposited; one apartment of which Dr.
Clarke found filled with earthen jars entire, laid
horizontally in tiers on one another, something like
bottles in a wine-bin. They were about fourteen
inches long, and conical in form, the cover being
fixed on by some kind of cement; when opened, they
were found to contain the bodies of birds (the ibis),
with white feathers tipped with black, or the heads
of monkeys, cats, and other animals, all carefully
bandaged up in linen.</p>

<p>Old Cairo sustained all the evils of a great famine
in the year of Christ 597. We adopt the account
given of this calamity from the Encyclop&aelig;dia Londinensis:&mdash;"Of
the number of poor who perished
with hunger," says Abtollatiph, "it is impossible to
form any probable estimate; but I will give the
reader some information on this subject, whence he
may form a faint idea of the mortality with which
Egypt was then afflicted. In Mesr, and Cairo, and
their confines, wherever a person turned he could not
avoid stumbling over some starved object, either
already dead, or in the agonies of death."</p>

<p>From Cairo alone nearly five hundred were daily
carried out to the burying-ground; and so great was
the mortality in Mesr, that the dead were thrown
out without the walls, where they remained unburied.</p>

<p>But afterwards, when the survivors were no longer
able to throw out the dead bodies, they were left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
wherever they expired, in the houses, shops, or streets.
The limbs of the dead were even cut in pieces, and
used for food; and instead of receiving the last offices
from their friends, and being decently interred, their
remains were attended by persons who were employed
in roasting or baking them.</p>

<p>In all the distant provinces and towns the inhabitants
became entirely extinct, except in the principal
cities, and some of the large towns, such as Kous
Ashmunein, Mahalla, &amp;c., and even there but a few
survived.</p>

<p>In those days a traveller might pass through a
city without finding in it one human creature alive.
He saw the houses open, and the inhabitants dead on
their faces, some grown putrid, and others who had
recently expired. If he entered into the houses, he
found them full of goods, but no one to make use
of them; and he saw nothing wherever he turned,
but a dreadful solitude, and a universal desolation.
This account rests not on the information and authority
of a single person, but of many, whose several
assertions mutually confirmed each other. One of
these gave information in the following words:&mdash;"We
entered a city, where no living creature
was to be found; we went into the houses, and
there we saw the inhabitants prostrate and dead, all
lying in a wretched group on the ground,&mdash;the husband,
the wife, and the children. Hence we passed
into another city, which contained, as we had heard,
four hundred shops of weavers: it was now a desert
like the former,&mdash;the artificer had expired in his
shop, and his family lay dead around him. A third
city, which we afterwards visited, appeared like the
former,&mdash;a scene of death and desolation. Being
obliged to reside in this place for some time, for the
purpose of agriculture, we ordered persons to throw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
the bodies of the dead into the hole at the rate of
ten for a diakem. Wolves and hyenas resorted here
in great numbers to feed on the corpses<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>."</p>

<h2><a name="NO_XXI_CANNAE" id="NO_XXI_CANNAE"></a>NO. XXI.&mdash;CANN&AElig;.</h2>


<p>Cann&aelig; is a small village of Apulia, near the
Aufidus, famous for a battle between Hannibal and
the Romans; and as the spot where the battle
was fought is still pointed out by the inhabitants,
and is still denominated "the field of blood," we
shall refresh the memories of our readers with an
account of it. Both armies having often removed
from place to place, came in sight of each other near
Cann&aelig;. As Hannibal was encamped in a level open
country, and his cavalry much superior to that of the
Romans, &AElig;milius did not think proper to engage in
such a place. He was for drawing the enemy into
an irregular spot, where the infantry might have the
greatest share of the action. But his colleague, who
was wholly inexperienced, was of a contrary opinion.
The troops on each side were, for some time, contented
with skirmishes; but, at last, one day when
Varro had the command, for the two consuls took it
by turns, preparations were made on both sides for
battle. &AElig;milius had not been consulted; yet, though he
extremely disapproved the conduct of his colleague,
as it was not in his power to prevent it, he seconded
him to the utmost. The two armies were very unequal
in numbers. That of the Romans, including
the allies, amounted to eighty thousand foot, and about
six thousand horse; and that of the Carthaginians
consisted but of forty thousand foot, all well disciplined,
and of ten thousand horse. &AElig;milius commanded
the right wing of the Romans; Varro the
left; and Servilius was posted in the centre. Han<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>nibal,
who had the art of taking all advantages, had
posted himself so as the south wind should blow
directly in the faces of the Romans during the fight<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>,
and cover them with dust. Then keeping the river
Aufidus on his left, and posting his cavalry on the
wings, he formed his main body of the Spanish
and Gallic infantry, which he posted in the centre,
with half the African heavy armed foot on the right,
and half on their left, on the same line with the
cavalry. His army being thus drawn up, he put
himself at the head of the Spanish and Gallic infantry,
and having drawn themselves out in a line, advanced
to begin the battle, rounding his front as he advanced
near the enemy. The fight soon began, and the
Roman legions that were in the wings, seeing their
centre firmly attacked, advanced to charge the enemy
in flank. Hannibal's main body, after a brave resistance,
finding themselves furiously attacked on all
sides, gave way, being overpowered in numbers. The
Romans having pursued them with eager confusion,
the two wings of the African infantry, which was
fresh, well armed, and in good order, wheeled about
on a sudden towards that void space in which the
Romans had thrown themselves in disorder, and
attacked them vigorously on both sides without
allowing them time to recover themselves, or leaving
them ground to draw up. In the mean time, the
two wings of the cavalry having defeated those of the
Romans, which were much inferior to them, advanced
and charged the rest of the Roman infantry, which
being surrounded at once on every side by the enemy's
horse and foot, was all cut to pieces, after having
fought with great bravery. &AElig;milius being covered
with wounds, he received in the fight, was afterwards
killed by a body of the enemy to whom he was not
known. Above seventy thousand men fell in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
battle; and the Carthaginians, so great was their
fury, did not give over the slaughter till Hannibal,
in the very heat of it, cried out to them several
times, "Stop, soldiers, spare the vanquished." Ten
thousand men, who had been left to guard the
camps, surrendered themselves prisoners of war
after the battle. Varro, the consul, retired to Venusia
with only seventy horse; and about four thousand
men escaped into the neighbouring cities. Hannibal
remained master of the field, he being chiefly indebted
for this, as well as for his former victories, to the
superiority of his cavalry over the Romans. Maherbal,
one of the Carthaginian generals, advised Hannibal to
march directly to Rome, promising him that within
five days they should sup in the capital. Hannibal,
answering, that it was an affair that required mature
examination&mdash;"I see," replies Maherbal, "that the
gods have not endowed the same men with all talents.
You, Hannibal, know how to conquer, but not to
make the best use of a victory." It is pretended
that this delay saved Rome and the empire. Many
authors, and among the rest Livy, charge Hannibal
on this occasion as if guilty of a capital error. But
others, more reserved, are not for condemning without
evident proofs, so renowned a general, who, in the
rest of his conduct, was never wanting either in prudence
to make choice of the best expedient, or in
readiness to put his designs in execution. They,
besides, are inclined to judge favourably of him from
the authority, or, at least, the silence of Polybius,
who, speaking of the memorable consequences of this
celebrated battle, says, "That the Carthaginians were
firmly persuaded, that they should possess themselves
of Rome at the first assault:" but then he does not
mention how this could possibly have been effected;
as that city was very populous, warlike, strongly
fortified, and defended with a garrison of two legions;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
nor does he anywhere give the least hint that such
a project was feasible, or that Hannibal did wrong,
in not attempting to put it in execution.</p>

<p>Soon after the battle of Cann&aelig;, Hannibal despatched
his brother to Carthage with the news of his
victory; and at the same time to demand succours, in
order that he might be enabled to put an end to the
war. Mago being arrived, made, in full senate, a
lofty speech, in which he extolled his brother's exploits,
and displayed the great advantages he had
gained over the Romans. And to give a more lively
idea of the greatness of the victory, by speaking in
some measure to the eye, he poured out in the middle
of the senate a bushel of gold rings which had been
taken from such of the Roman nobility as had fallen
in the battle.</p>

<p>A ridge of low hills<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>, bare of wood, and laid out
in grass or corn land, confines the river for four miles,
at the end of which, bounded by knolls, stood the
city of Cann&aelig;. The traces of the town, however,
are very faint, consisting of fragments of altars, cornices,
gates, walls, vaults, and under-ground granaries.
"My eyes ranged at large over the vast expanse
of unvariegated plains," says Mr. Swinburne: "all
was silent; not a man, not an animal, appeared to
enliven the scene. We stood on ruins and over
vaults; the banks of the river were desert and wild.
My thoughts naturally assumed the tint of the dreary
prospect, as I reflected on the fate of Carthage and of
Rome. Rome recovered from the blow she received
in these fields; but her liberty, her fame, and trophies,
have long been levelled in the dust. Carthage
lies in ruins less discernible than those of the paltry
walls of Cann&aelig;; the very traces of them have almost
vanished from the face of the earth. The daring
projects, marches, and exploits of her hero, even the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
victory, obtained upon this spot, would, like thousands
of other human achievements, have been long
buried in oblivion, had not his very enemies consigned
him to immortality; for the annals of Carthage exist
no more."</p>

<p>The peasants showed Mr. Swinburne some spurs
and heads of lances, which had been turned up by the
plough a short time before he visited the spot, and
told him, that horse-loads of armour and weapons had
been found and carried away at different times<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="NO_XXII_CAPUA" id="NO_XXII_CAPUA"></a>NO. XXII.&mdash;CAPUA.</h2>


<p>Capua, once the chief city of Campania, was founded
by Capys, who is described as having been the father,
or rather the companion, of Anchises. It was at
one time so opulent, that it was called "the other
Rome."</p>

<p>Perhaps our readers will have no objection to have
their memories refreshed by an allusion to the mistake,
committed at this place by Hannibal. The details
of it will give some variety to our page. It is thus
related by Rollin, from the luminous page of Livy:&mdash;"The
battle of Cann&aelig; subjected the most powerful
nations of Italy to Hannibal, drew over to his interest
Gr&aelig;cia Magna; also wrested from the Romans their
most ancient allies, amongst whom the Capuans held
the first rank. This city, by the fertility of its soil,
its advantageous situation, and the blessings of a long
peace, had risen to great wealth and power. Luxury,
and a flow of pleasures, the usual attendants on wealth,
had corrupted the minds of all the citizens, who, from
their natural inclination, were but too much addicted
to voluptuousness and all excesses. Hannibal made
choice of this city for his winter-quarters. There it
was that his soldiers, who had sustained the most
grievous toils, and braved the most formidable dan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>gers,
were overthrown by delights and a profusion of
all things, into which they plunged with the greater
eagerness as they, till then, had been entire strangers
to them. Their courage was so enervated in this
bewitching retirement, that all their after-efforts
were owing rather to the fame and splendour of their
former victories than to their present strength. When
Hannibal marched his forces out of the city, one
would have taken them for other men, and the
reverse of those who had so lately marched into it.
Accustomed, during the winter season, to commodious
lodgings, to ease and plenty, they were no
longer able to bear hunger, thirst, long marches,
watchings, and the other toils of war; not to mention
that all obedience, all discipline, were laid aside."</p>

<p>Livy thinks that Hannibal's stay at Capua is a
reproach to his conduct; and pretends that he there
was guilty of an infinitely greater error than when he
neglected to march directly to Rome after the battle
of Cann&aelig;:&mdash;"For this delay," says Livy, "might
seem only to have retarded his victory; whereas this
last misconduct rendered him absolutely incapable of
ever defeating the enemy. In a word, as Marcellus
observed judiciously afterwards, Capua was to the
Carthaginians and their general, what Cann&aelig; had
been to the Romans. There their martial genius,
their love of discipline, were lost; there their former
fame, and their almost certain hopes of future glory,
vanished at once, and, indeed, from thenceforth, the
affairs of Hannibal advanced to their decline by swift
steps; fortune declared in favour of prudence, and
victory seemed now reconciled to the Romans." It is
doubted, however, whether Livy has reason to impute
all these fatal consequences to the agreeable abode at
Capua. It might, indeed, have been one cause, but this
would be a very inconsiderable one; and the bravery
with which the forces of Hannibal afterwards defeated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
the armies of consuls and pr&aelig;tors; the towns they
took even in sight of the Romans; their maintaining
their conquests so vigorously, and staying
fourteen years after this in Italy in spite of the
Romans; all these circumstances may induce us to
believe that Livy lays too much stress on the delights
of Capua. In fact, the chief cause of the decay of
Hannibal's affairs was his want of necessary supplies
and succours from Carthage.</p>

<p>The revolt of Capua to the Carthaginians proved
its ruin; for when taken by the consuls Fulvius and
Claudius, it was punished for its perfidy. Genseric,
the Vandal, however, was more cruel than the Romans
had been; for he massacred the inhabitants and burned
the town to the ground. Narses rebuilt it; but in
841 it was totally destroyed by an army of Saracens,
and the inhabitants driven to the mountains<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>. Some
time after the retreat of these savage invaders, the
Lombards ventured down again into the plain; but
not deeming their force adequate to the defence of so
great a circuit as the large city, they built themselves
a smaller one on the river, and called it Capua.</p>

<p>In 1501 this new city was taken by storm by the
French, who, according to Guicciardini and Giannone,
committed the most flagitious acts of rapine, lust,
and enormity.</p>

<p>"The amphitheatre of Old Capua," says Mr.
Forsyth, "recals to us the sublime image of Spartacus.
It resembles the Coliseum in its form and in
its fate. Both were raised on magnificent designs&mdash;negligently
executed. Both have suffered from barbarians
and from modern builders; but the solitude
of the Campanian ruin has exposed it to greater
dilapidation than the Roman has yet undergone.
Part of its materials has emigrated to modern
Capua; a part is buried in its own arena. The first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
order of columns is half interred; the second has none
entire."</p>

<p>Though much defaced by the loss of its marble<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>,
this structure offers many ornaments peculiar to itself.
It is considerably smaller than the Flavian amphitheatre
at Rome; but worthy of the first among the
second cities of the empire: the monuments still to
be seen on the spot are certainly of a date long posterior
to Capua's independence, and even to that of Roman
liberty. The lower order of the amphitheatre is
Tuscan; the second Doric. What the upper ones
were cannot be ascertained: on the keystone of each
arcade was the bust of a deity of a colossal size and
coarse execution, much too massive for the rest of
the work. It had four entrances, and was built of
brick, faced with stone or marble. The little value
set upon brick has preserved it; while the other
materials have been torn down to mend roads and
build cottages.</p>

<p>"From Caserta," says Mr. Forsyth, "it is but
half an hour's ride to the remains of ancient Capua<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>.
Some tombs on the road, though ruined and encumbered
with bushes, display a variety of sepulchral
forms, unknown during the Roman republic. Most
of the Campanian tombs, anterior to C&aelig;sar, had been
demolished by his soldiers, while searching for painted
vases; for Capua, though late in learning the ceramic
art, was more productive than the rest of Campania."
Vases have lately been discovered here in great
variety, and antiquaries find out purposes for them
all; either in the form, or the size, or the painting, or
their own imagination<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="NO_XXIII_CARTHAGE" id="NO_XXIII_CARTHAGE"></a>NO. XXIII.&mdash;CARTHAGE.</h2>


<p>Carthage was founded by the Tyrians about the
year of the world 3158, and 846 before Christ; that
is, at the period in which Joash was king of Judah.
Its empire lasted about seven hundred years.</p>

<p>The Carthaginians were indebted to the Tyrians
not only for their origin, but their manners, customs,
laws, religion, and their general application to commerce.
They spoke the same language with the
Tyrians, and these the same with the Canaanites and
Israelites; that is, the Hebrew; or at least a language
entirely derived from it.</p>

<p>The strict union, which always subsisted between
the Ph&#339;nicians and Carthaginians, is remarkable.
When Cambyses had resolved to make war upon the
latter, the Ph&#339;nicians, who formed the chief strength
of his fleet, told him plainly, that they could not
serve him against their countrymen: and this declaration
obliged that prince to lay aside his design.
The Carthaginians, on their side, were never forgetful
of the country from whence they came, and to which
they owed their origin. They sent regularly every
year to Tyre a ship freighted with presents, as a
quit-rent or acknowledgment, paid to their ancient
country; and its tutelar gods had an annual sacrifice
offered to them by the Carthaginians, who considered
them as their protectors. They never failed to send
thither the first fruits of their revenues, nor the
tithe of the spoils taken from their enemies, or
offerings to Hercules, one of the principal gods of
Tyre and Carthage.</p>

<p>The foundation of Carthage is ascribed to Elisa, a
Tyrian princess, better known by the name of Dido.
She married her relation, whose name was Sich&aelig;us.
Her brother was Pigmalion, king of Tyre. Sich&aelig;us
being extremely rich, Pigmalion put him to death in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
order to seize upon his wealth; but the plan did not
succeed; for Dido managed to elude his avarice, by
withdrawing from the city with all her husband's
possessions. Taking all these out to sea, she wandered
about for some time; till, coming to the gulf,
on the borders of which Utica stood, about fifteen
miles from Tunis, then but too well known for its
corsairs, she landed for the purpose of considering what
plan it would be proper to pursue. Invited by the
hope of profit, the people of the neighbouring country
soon began to frequent the new settlement; and those
brought others from more distant parts, and the town
soon began to wear an air of importance.</p>

<p>Utica having also been raised by a colony from
Tyre, its inhabitants entered into friendship with the
new comers. They deputed envoys with considerable
presents and exhorted them to build a city. This
exhortation was seconded by the natives of the country.
All things conspiring to so great an object,
Dido immediately entered into a treaty with the
natives for a certain portion of land, and having
agreed to pay an annual tribute to the Africans for
the ground on which the town was to stand, she
built that celebrated city, so universally known, and
gave it the name of Carthada, or Carthage, a word
signifying the "New City<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>."</p>

<p>Dido was soon sought in marriage by the king of
Getulia, named Iarbus. Having determined on never
marrying again, out of compliment to her lost husband,
Sich&aelig;us, she desired time for consideration.
We must now follow the true history, and neglect
the false one; that is, we must follow Justin, and
altogether disregard Virgil; since, to answer the
purposes of his poem, as well as those of a political
nature, he has fixed the building of Carthage no less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
than three hundred years before the period in which
it actually occurred.</p>

<p>Justin's account is this<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>:&mdash;"Iarbus, king of the
Mauritanians, sending for ten of the principal Carthaginians,
demanded Dido in marriage, threatening to
declare war against her in case of refusal. The
ambassadors, being afraid to deliver the message of
Iarbus, told her, with punic honesty, that he wanted
to have some person sent him, who was capable of
civilizing and polishing himself and his Africans;
but there was no possibility of finding any Carthaginian,
who would be willing to quit his native place
and kindred, for the conversation of barbarians, who
were as savage as the wildest beasts. Here the
queen, with indignation, interrupted them, asking
if they were not ashamed to refuse living in any
manner which might be beneficial to their country,
to which they owed their lives. They then delivered
the king's message, and bade her set them a pattern,
and sacrifice herself to her country's welfare. Dido,
being thus ensnared, called on Sich&aelig;us, with tears
and lamentations, and answered that she would go
where the fate of her city called her. At the expiration
of three months she ascended the fatal pile,
and with her last breath told the spectators, that she
was going to her husband, as they had ordered her."</p>

<p>The first war made by the Carthaginians was
against the Africans, in order to free themselves from
the tribute they had engaged to pay. In this, however,
they were foiled. They afterwards carried
their arms against the Moors and Numidians, and
won conquest from both. They had then a dispute
with Cyrene, on account of their respective limits.
This quarrel was settled without much trouble. They
soon after conquered Sardinia, Majorca, and Minorca.
Then they added many cities in Spain to their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
conquests; though it is not known at what period
they entered that country, nor how far they extended
their conquests. Their conquests were slow at the
first; but in the process of time, they subjugated
nearly the whole country. They became soon after
masters of nearly all Sicily. This excited the jealousy
of the Romans; and Sicily became an arena for the
trial of their respective strength. "What a fine field
of battle," said Pyrrhus, as he left that island, "do
we leave the Carthaginians and Romans!"</p>

<p>The wars between Rome and Carthage were three,
and they are called, in the history of the former city,
"Punic" wars. The first lasted twenty-four years;
then there was an interval of peace, but that expired
at the end of twenty-four years more. The second
Punic war took up seventeen years; and then ensued
another interval of forty-nine years; followed by the
third Punic war, which terminated, after a contest of
four years and some months, in the total destruction
of Carthage.</p>

<p>The first was terminated in a treaty to the following
effect<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>, that "there shall be peace between the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Carthaginians and Romans, on the following conditions:&mdash;The
Carthaginians shall evacuate all Sicily;
shall no longer make war against the Syracusans or
their allies; shall restore to the Romans, without
ransom, all the prisoners whom they shall have
taken from them; pay one thousand talents of silver
immediately; and two thousand two hundred talents
of silver within the space of ten years; and, also,
depart out of all the islands situated between Italy
and Sicily." Sardinia was not comprehended in this
treaty; but they gave it up in a treaty some years
after. This was the longest war that had then been
known in any country; it having lasted four-and-twenty
years. "The obstinacy in disputing for empire,"
says the historian, "was equal on both sides;
the same resolution, the same greatness of soul, in
forming as well as in executing of projects being
equal on both sides. The Carthaginians had the
superiority over the Romans, with regard to naval
affairs; the strength and swiftness of their vessels;
the working of them; the skill and capacity of their
pilots; the knowledge of coasts, shallows, roads and
winds; and in the inexhaustible fund of wealth which
furnished all the expenses of so long and obstinate
a war.</p>

<p>The qualities and capabilities of the Romans were
of a different character. They had none of the advantages
above stated; but their courage, and regard for
the public good, are said to have supplied all of
them; and their soldiers were greatly superior to
those of Carthage, not only in skill but in courage.</p>

<p>The Carthaginians had scarcely closed the war
with the Romans, than they were engaged in another
against the mercenaries who had served under them
in Sicily. This was a short but a very sanguinary
war. These mercenaries being returned to the neighbourhood
of Carthage, were unjustly treated, in not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
being paid the wages they had earned by the assistance
they had given. Complaints, seditious and
insolent murmurs, were heard on every side. These
troops being composed of different nations, who were
strangers to one another's language, were incapable of
hearing reason when they once mutinied. They consisted
of Gauls, Ligurians, Spaniards, and natives of
the Balearic islands; a great number of Greek slaves
and deserters; and a large number of Africans.</p>

<p>These troops having been trifled with by the
Carthaginian government, the members of which
attempted to defraud them of no small share of what
they had earned, broke out into ungovernable fury,
and being twenty thousand strong, marched towards
Carthage, and encamped at Tunis, a city not far from
the metropolis.</p>

<p>The insurgents now began to act the part their
employers had set them the example of. They rose
in their demands far above what was due to them;
and the Carthaginians at length saw the error of
having given way to a dishonest policy. The points
at issue, however, were at last, in a great measure,
arranged, when two soldiers among the mercenaries
found means to raise the whole of their comrades into
mutiny, and engaged several cities to take up their
cause. Their army amounted, after a while, to seventy
thousand men. Carthage had never been in such
urgent danger before. The command of the army
was given to Hanno. Troops were levied by land and
sea; horse as well as foot. All the citizens capable
of bearing arms were mustered; all their ships were
refitted; and mercenaries were enlisted from all parts.
On the other hand, the insurgents harassed them
with perpetual alarms, advancing to their walls by
night as well as by day.</p>

<p>When the mercenaries, who had been left in Sardinia,
heard of what their comrades had effected in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
Africa, they shook off their yoke in imitation, murdered
the general who commanded them, and all the
Carthaginians who served under him; and a successor,
who was sent from Carthage, also the forces
which had accompanied him, went over to the rebels.
They hung the new general on a cross, and put all
the Carthaginians then in Sardinia to the sword,
after making them suffer inexpressible torments.
They then besieged all the cities one after another,
and soon got possession of the whole country.</p>

<p>When they had effected this, they quarrelled
among themselves; and the natives taking advantage
of that, became soon enabled to drive them out of
the island. They took refuge in Italy, where, after
some scruples on the part of the Romans, they induced
that people to sail over to Sardinia, and render
themselves masters of it. When the Carthaginians
heard of this, they were highly indignant; and the
matter terminated, at length, in what is called the
Second Punic war.</p>

<p>This war had many remote causes besides the one
we have just stated: but for these, as well as its
astonishing variety of incidents and fortunes, we must
refer to the various histories of the two states. We can
only state the issue. We cannot, however, deny
ourselves the satisfaction of quoting what Rollin says
with regard to the general subject:&mdash;"Whether we
consider the boldness of the enterprises; the wisdom
employed in the execution; the obstinate efforts of the
two rival nations, and the ready resources they found
in their lowest ebb of fortune; the variety of uncommon
events, and the uncertain issue of so long and bloody a
war; or, lastly, the assemblage of the most perfect
models in every kind of merit; we cannot but consider
them as the most instructive lessons that occur in history,
either with regard to war, policy, or government.
Neither did two more powerful, or, at least, more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
warlike states or nations make war against each other;
and never had those in question seen themselves
raised to a more exalted pitch of power and glory."</p>

<p>Though, as we have already hinted, there were
many remote causes for this war, the more immediate
one was the taking of Saguntum by the Carthaginian
general, Hannibal. We shall speak of the
fall of this city when we come to describe its ruins,
which still remain.</p>

<p>Words, we are told, could never express the grief
and consternation with which the news of the taking
of Saguntum was received at Rome. The senate
sent immediately deputies to Carthage to inquire
whether Saguntum had been besieged by order of
the republic; and, if so, to declare war: or, in case
the siege had been undertaken solely by the authority
of Hannibal, that he should be delivered up to
the Romans. The senate not giving any answer to
this demand, one of the deputies took up the folded
lappet of his robe, and said in a proud voice, "I
bring here either peace or war; the choice is left to
yourselves." To this the senate answered, "We
leave the choice to you." The deputy then declared,
"I give you war then." "And we," answered the
senate, "as heartily accept it; and we are resolved
to prosecute it with the same cheerfulness." Such
was the beginning of the second Punic war.</p>

<p>During this war Hannibal made his celebrated
march over the Alps. He entered Italy, and fought
the battles of Ticinus, Trebia, Thrasymene, and
Cann&aelig;. He besieged Capua, and then Rome. In
the mean time Scipio conquers all Spain; and
having been appointed consul, he sets sail for Africa,
and carries the war into the bosom of the Carthaginian
state. Success attended him every where.</p>

<p>When the council of "one hundred" found this,
they deputed thirty of their body to the tent of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
Roman general, when they all threw themselves
prostrate upon the earth, such being the custom of
the country, spoke to him in terms of great submission,
and accused Hannibal of being the author of all
their calamities, and promised, in the name of the
senate, implicit obedience to whatever the Romans
should be pleased to ordain.</p>

<p>Scipio answered, that though he was come into
Africa for conquest, and not for peace, he would,
nevertheless, grant them one, upon condition, that
they should deliver up all the Roman prisoners and
deserters; that they should recal their armies out of
Gaul and Italy; that they should never set foot
again in Spain; that they should retire out of all the
islands between Italy and Africa; that they should
deliver up all their ships except twenty; give the
Romans five hundred thousand bushels of wheat;
three hundred thousand of barley; and, moreover,
pay to the Romans fifteen thousand talents.</p>

<p>These terms the Carthaginians consented to; but
their compliance was only in appearance: their design
being to gain time to recal Hannibal. That general was
then in Italy. Rome was almost within his grasp.
He had, perhaps, seized it, had he marched thither
immediately on gaining the battle of Cann&aelig;. The
order to return home overwhelmed him with indignation
and sorrow. "Never banished man,"
says Livy, "showed so much regret at leaving his
native country as Hannibal did in going out
of that of an enemy." He was exasperated almost
to madness to see himself thus forced to quit
his prey. Arriving in his own country&mdash;for we must
hasten our narrative&mdash;that celebrated meeting between
the two generals at Zama took place, which
makes so conspicuous a figure in Roman and Carthaginian
history.</p>

<p>The issue of this meeting was a battle, in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
the Carthaginians, after an obstinate engagement,
took to flight, leaving ten thousand men on the field
of battle. Hannibal escaped in the tumult, and
entering Carthage, owned that he was overthrown;
that the disaster was irrecoverable; and that the
citizens had no other choice left but to accept whatever
terms the conqueror chose to impose.</p>

<p>After some difficulty and opposition in the Carthaginian
senate, peace was agreed upon. The terms
were exceedingly hard. They were these:&mdash;that the
Carthaginians should continue free and preserve their
laws, territories, and the cities they possessed in Africa
during the war. That they should deliver up to the
Romans all deserters, slaves, and captives belonging to
them; all their ships, except ten triremes; all their
tame elephants; and that they should not train up any
more for war. That they should not make war out of
Africa, nor even in that country, without obtaining
leave for that purpose of the Roman people; should
restore to Masinissa all they had dispossessed either
him or his ancestors of; should furnish money and
corn to the Roman auxiliaries, till their ambassadors
should be returned from Rome; should pay to the
Romans ten thousand Euboic talents<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> of silver in
fifty annual payments, and give one hundred hostages,
who should be nominated by Scipio.</p>

<p>These were hard terms indeed; and when Scipio
burnt all the ships, to the amount of five hundred in
the harbour of Carthage, these ships which had
been the cause of all the power of Carthage, Carthage
appeared to its inhabitants as if it never could
recover; nor, indeed, did it ever do so. The blow
was fatal.</p>

<p>This war lasted seventeen years: the peace which
succeeded, fifty<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>. Twenty-five years after it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
concluded, Hannibal poisoned himself at the court of
Prusias.</p>

<p>We must now pass to the war, which soon after
occurred between the Carthaginians and Masinissa,
king of Numidia. In this war the Carthaginians
were, in the end, worsted. Scipio the younger, who
afterwards destroyed Carthage, was present at the
battle. He had been sent by Lucullus, who commanded
in Spain, to Masinissa to desire some elephants.
During the whole engagement, he is represented
as standing upon a neighbouring hill; and
was greatly surprised to see Masinissa, then eighty-eight
years of age, mounted, agreeably to the custom
of his country, on a horse without a saddle, flying
from rank to rank like a young officer, and sustaining
the most arduous toils. The fight was very obstinate,
and continued all day; but at last the Carthaginians
gave way, and Masinissa afterwards turned
their camp into a blockade, so that no provisions
could reach them. A famine ensued, and then the
plague. They were, in consequence, reduced to
agreeing to the king's terms, which were no other
than these:&mdash;to deliver up all deserters; to pay five
thousands talents of silver in fifty years, and restore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
all exiles. They were, also, made to suffer the ignominy
of passing under the yoke; and dismissed with
only one suit of clothes for each. Nor did their
misfortunes terminate here. Gulussa, the son of
Masinissa, whom the Carthaginians had treated in a
disrespectful manner, intercepted them with a body
of cavalry. They could neither resist nor escape.
The consequence of which was, that out of fifty-eight
thousand men only a very few returned to
Carthage.</p>

<p>During the latter part of the second Punic war, it
was stated in the Roman senate, that Rome could
never be in safety while Carthage was permitted to
exist:&mdash;"Carthage," said Cato, at the close of all
his speeches, "must be destroyed." The time soon
came, in which the threat was to be carried into
execution: and this brings us to the commencement
of the third and last Punic war. It lasted only
four years; and yet it terminated in the total ruin
and destruction of Carthage.</p>

<p>This war arose out of that which the Carthaginians
had waged against Masinissa; that prince
being an ally of the Romans. The vanquished party
sent to Rome to justify their proceedings. When
the matter came to be debated in the senate, Cato
and Scipio were of different opinions. Nasica desired
the preservation of Carthage, in order that the
people might, who were grown excessively insolent,
have something to fear. Cato, on the other hand,
thought, that as the people had become what Nasica
represented them, it was highly dangerous that so
powerful an enemy as Carthage should be allowed to
remain. "They may one day conquer us, so great
is our prosperity." He was but lately returned from
Africa; and he represented in the senate, that he
had not found Carthage exhausted either of men or
money. On the contrary, that it was full of vigorous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
young men, and abounded with immense quantities
of gold and silver, and prodigious magazines of arms
and all warlike stores; and was, moreover, so haughty
and confident on account of all this, that their hopes
and ambition had no bounds. On saying this, he
took from the lappet of his coat a few figs, and,
throwing them on the table, and the senators admiring
them&mdash;he called out, "Know, this; it is but
three days those figs were gathered; so short is the
distance between the enemy and us."</p>

<p>The Carthaginians not having made good their
cause in regard to their conduct towards Masinissa,
war was declared against them, and the generals<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>,
who were charged with the command, received strict
injunctions not to end the war but with the destruction
of Carthage.</p>

<p>These instructions the Carthaginians did not
become acquainted with till some time after. They,
therefore, sent deputies to make all manner of submission.
They were even instructed to declare, if necessity
required, that they were willing to give themselves
up, with all they possessed, to the will and pleasure of
the Romans. On arriving at Rome, the deputies found
that the war had been, before their arrival, already
proclaimed, and that the army had actually sailed.
They therefore returned to Carthage with certain
proposals, in complying with which the Romans
declared they would be satisfied. Amongst the
terms demanded were three hundred hostages, the
flower and the last hopes of the noblest families
in Carthage. No spectacle, we are told, was ever
more moving: nothing was heard but cries; nothing
seen but tears; and all places echoed with groans
and lamentations. Above all, the unhappy mothers,
bathed in tears, tore their dishevelled hair, beat their
breasts, and expressed their grief in terms so moving,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
that even savage beasts might have been moved to
compassion. But the scene is stated to have been
much more moving when the fatal moment arrived
when, after having accompanied their children to the
ship, they bade them a long and last farewell, persuaded
that they should never see them again. They
wept a flood of tears over them, embraced them with
the utmost fondness, clasped them eagerly in their
arms, and could not be prevailed upon to part with
them, till they were forced away.</p>

<p>When the hostages arrived at Rome, the deputies
were informed that when they should arrive at Utica,
the consuls would acquaint them with the orders of
the republic. The deputies, therefore, repaired to
Utica, where they received orders to deliver up,
without delay, all their arms. This command was
put immediately in execution; and a long train of
waggons soon after arrived at the Roman camp,
laden with two hundred thousand complete sets of
armour, a numberless multitude of darts and javelins,
with two thousand engines for shooting darts and
stones. Then followed the deputies, and a great
number of the most venerable senators and priests,
who came with the hope of moving the Romans to
compassion. When they arrived, Censorinus addressed
them in the following manner:&mdash;"I cannot but commend
the readiness with which you execute the
orders of the senate. They have commanded me to
tell you, that it is their will and pleasure, that you
depart out of Carthage, which they have resolved
entirely to destroy; and that you remove into any
other part of your dominions you shall think proper,
provided it be at the distance of eight stadia (twelve
miles) from the sea."</p>

<p>The instant the consul had pronounced this fulminating
decree, nothing was heard among the Carthaginians
but shrieks and howlings. Being now in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
manner thunderstruck, they neither knew where
they were, nor what they did; but rolled themselves
in the dust, tearing their clothes, and unable to vent
their grief any otherwise but by broken sighs and
deep groans. Being afterwards a little recovered,
they lifted up their hands with the air of suppliants,
one moment towards the gods, and the next towards
the Romans, imploring their mercy and justice with
regard to a people, who would soon be reduced to the
extremities of despair. But as both the gods and
men were deaf to their fervent prayers, they now
changed them into reproaches and imprecations;
bidding the Romans call to mind, that there were
such beings as avenging deities, whose severe eyes
were ever open on guilt and treachery. The Romans
themselves could not refrain from tears at so moving
a spectacle: but their resolution was fixed. The
deputies could not even prevail so far as to get the
execution of the order suspended, till they should
have an opportunity of presenting themselves again
before the senate, if possible, to get it revoked. They
were forced to set out immediately, and carry the
answer to Carthage.</p>

<p>The people waited for their return, with such an
impatience and terror, as words can never express.
It was scarcely possible for them to break through
the crowd that flocked around them, to hear the
answer which was but too strongly painted in their
faces. When they were come into the senate, and
had declared the barbarous orders of the Romans,
a general shriek informed the people of their too
lamentable fate; and from that instant nothing was
seen or heard in every part of the city but howling
and despair, madness and fury. The consuls made
no great haste to march against Carthage; not suspecting
they had reason to be under apprehension
from that city, as it was now disarmed. However,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the inhabitants took advantage of this delay to put
themselves in a posture of defence, being all unanimously
resolved not to quit the city. They appointed,
as a general, without the walls, Asdrubal,
who was at the head of twenty thousand men; and
to whom deputies were sent accordingly, to entreat
him to forget, for his country's sake, the injustice
which had been done to him, from the dread they
were under of the Romans. The command of the
troops, within the walls, was given to another Asdrubal,
grandson to Masinissa. They then applied
themselves to making arms with considerable expedition.
The temples, the palaces, the open markets
and squares, were all changed into so many arsenals,
where men and women worked day and night.
Every day were made one hundred and forty shields,
three hundred swords, five hundred pikes or javelins,
a thousand arrows, and a great number of engines to
discharge them; and because they wanted materials
to make ropes, the women cut off their hair, and
abundantly supplied their wants on this occasion.</p>

<p>The combat, which was carried on from the tops
of the houses, continued six days, during which a
dreadful slaughter was made. To clear the streets,
and make way for the troops, the Romans dragged
aside with hooks the bodies of such of the inhabitants
as had been slain, or precipitated headlong from the
houses, and threw them into pits, the greatest part
of them being still alive and panting.</p>

<p>There was still reason to believe that the siege
would last much longer, and occasion a great effusion
of blood. But on the seventh day there appeared a
company of men, in a suppliant posture and habit,
who desired no other conditions, but that the Romans
would be pleased to spare the lives of all those who
should be willing to leave the citadel; which request
was granted them. The deserters only were excepted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
Accordingly, there came out fifty thousand men and
women, who were sent into the fields under a strong
guard. The deserters were about nine hundred.
Finding they would be allowed no quarter, they fortified
themselves in the temple of &AElig;sculapius, with
Asdrubal, his wife, and two children; where, though
their number was but small, they might have held
out a long time, because the temple stood on a very
high hill, upon rocks, to which the ascent was by
sixty steps. But, at last, exhausted by hunger and
watchings, oppressed with fear, and seeing their
destruction at hand, they lost all patience, when,
abandoning the lower part of the temple, they retired
to the uppermost story, and resolved not to quit it
but with their lives.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Asdrubal, being desirous of
saving his own life, came down privately to Scipio,
carrying an olive-branch in his hand, and threw himself
at his feet. Scipio showed him immediately to
the deserters, who, transported with rage and fury
at the sight, vented millions of imprecations against
him, and set fire to the temple. Whilst it was lighting,
we are told that Asdrubal's wife, dressing herself
as splendidly as possible, and placing herself and
her two children in sight of Scipio, addressed him
with a loud voice:&mdash;"I call not down," says she,
"curses on thy head, O Roman, for thou only takest
the privilege allowed by the laws of war: but may
the gods of Carthage, and thou, in concert with them,
punish, according to his deserts, the false wretch who
has betrayed his country, his gods, his wife, his
children!" Then directing herself to Asdrubal,
"perfidious wretch!" says she, "thou basest of
creatures! this fire will presently consume both me
and my children; but as to thee, too shameful general
of Carthage,&mdash;go,&mdash;adorn the gay triumph of thy
conqueror,&mdash;suffer, in the sight of all Rome, the tor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>tures
thou so justly deservest!" She had no sooner
pronounced these words, but, seizing her children,
she cut their throats, threw them into the flames,
and afterwards rushed into them herself; in which
she was imitated by all the deserters. With regard
to Scipio, when he saw this famous city, which had
flourished seven hundred years, and might have been
compared to the greatest empires on account of the
extent of its dominions both by sea and land, its
mighty armies, its fleets, elephants, and riches, and
that the Carthaginians were even superior to other
nations, by their courage and greatness of soul, as,
notwithstanding their being deprived of armies and
ships, they had sustained, for three whole years, all
the hardships and calamities of a long siege; seeing,
I say, this city entirely ruined, historians relate, that
he could not refuse his tears to the unhappy fate of
Carthage. He reflected that cities, nations, and
empires, are liable to revolutions no less than particular
men; that the like sad fate had attended Troy,
anciently so powerful; and in latter times, the Assyrians,
Medes, and Persians, whose dominions were
once of so great an extent; and lastly, the Macedonians,
whose empire had been so glorious throughout
the world. Full of these mournful ideas, he repeated
the following verses of Homer:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
The day shall come, that great avenging day,<br />
Which Troy's proud glories in the dust shall lay;<br />
When Priam's powers, and Priam's self shall fall,<br />
And one prodigious ruin follow all.<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">Thereby denouncing the future destiny of Rome, as
he himself confessed to Polybius, who desired Scipio
to explain himself on that occasion. Carthage being
taken in this manner, Scipio gave the plunder of it
(the gold, silver, statues, and other offerings which
should be found in the temples excepted) to his soldiers
for seven days. After this, adorning a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
small ship with the enemy's spoils, he sent it to
Rome, with the news of the victory. At the same
time he ordered the inhabitants of Sicily to come and
take possession of the pictures and statues, which the
Carthaginians had plundered them of in former wars.</p>

<p>When the news of the taking of Carthage was
brought to Rome, the people abandoned themselves
to the most immoderate transports of joy, as if the
public tranquillity had not been secured till that
instant. All ranks and degrees of men emulously
strove who should show the greatest gratitude towards
the gods; and the citizens were, for many
days, employed wholly in solemn sacrifices, in public
prayers, games, and spectacles.</p>

<p>After those religious duties were ended, the senate
sent ten commissioners into Africa, to regulate, in
conjunction with Scipio, the fate and condition of
that country in times to come. Their first care was
to demolish whatever was still remaining of Carthage:
and we may guess at the dimensions of this famous
city by what Florus says, viz., that it was seventeen
days on fire before it could be all consumed. Rome,
though mistress of almost the whole world, could not
believe herself safe as long as even the name of Carthage
was in being. Orders were given that it should
never be inhabited again; and dreadful imprecations
were denounced against those, who, contrary to this
prohibition, should attempt to rebuild any parts of
it. In the mean time, every one, who desired it, was
admitted to see Carthage; Scipio being well pleased
to have people view the sad ruins of a city, which
had dared to contend for empire with the majesty of
Rome.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>Commerce, strictly speaking, was the occupation
of Carthage, the particular object of its industry,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
and its peculiar and predominant characteristic. It
formed the greatest strength and the chief support
of that commonwealth. In a word, it may be
affirmed, that the power, the conquests, the credit,
and the glory of the Carthaginians, all flowed from
trade.</p>

<p>This gives Mr. Montague an opportunity of comparing
Carthage with England:&mdash;"To the commercial
maxims of the Carthaginians, we have added
their insatiable lust of gain, without their economy,
and contempt of luxury and effeminacy. To the
luxury and dissipation of the Romans, we have
joined their venality, without their military spirit:
and we feel the pernicious effects of the same species
of faction, which was the great leading cause to ruin
in both those republics. The Roman institution was
formed to make and to preserve their conquests.
Abroad invincible, at home invulnerable, they possessed
within themselves all the resources requisite
for a warlike nation. The military spirit of their
people, where every citizen was a soldier, furnished
inexhaustible supplies for their armies abroad, and
secured them at home from all attempts of invasion.
The Carthaginian was better calculated to acquire
than to preserve. They depended upon commerce
for the acquisition of wealth, and upon their wealth
for the protection of their commerce. They owed
their conquests to the venal blood and sinews of other
people; and, like their ancestors the Ph&#339;nicians, exhibited
their money bags as symbols of their power.
They trusted too much to the valour of foreigners, and
too little to that of their own natives. Thus while
they were formidable abroad by their fleets and mercenary
armies, they were weak and defenceless at
home. But the great event showed how dangerous
it is for the greatest commercial nation to rely on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
this kind of mercantile policy; and that a nation of
unarmed undisciplined traders can never be a match,
whilst they are so circumstanced, for a nation of
soldiers."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the denunciations of the senate
against all who should attempt to rebuild Carthage,
the senators were induced, in a very short period,
themselves to sanction the undertaking.</p>

<p>When Marius took refuge in Africa, outcast and
deserted, he is said to have dwelt in a hovel amidst
the ruins of Carthage. The answer of Marius to the
pr&aelig;tor of Africa, is one of the finest indications of a
strong mind recorded in history. Oppressed with every
species of misfortune, Marius, after escaping many dangers,
arrived at length in Africa; where he hoped to
have received some mark of favour from the governor.
He was scarcely landed, however, when an officer
came to him, and addressed him after the following
manner:&mdash;"Marius, I am directed by the pr&aelig;tor to
forbid your landing in Africa. If, after this message,
you shall persist in doing so, he will not fail to treat
you as a public enemy." Struck with indignation at
this unexpected intelligence, Marius, without making
any reply, fixed his eyes, in a stern menacing manner,
upon the officer. In this position he stood for some
time. At length, the officer desiring to know whether
he chose to return any answer;&mdash;"Yes," replied
Marius, "go to the pr&aelig;tor, and tell him that thou
hast seen the exiled Marius, sitting among the ruins
of Carthage<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>."</p>

<p>Twenty-four years after the victory of &AElig;milianus
(<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 142), the sedition of Tiberius Gracchus began
to be formidable to the patricians, since he was supported
by the great body of the people in his endeavours
to pass an Agrarian law. Gracchus, finding
himself unable to accomplish his purpose, was pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>bably
not unwilling to accept the offer, made to him
by the senate, of becoming the leader of six thousand
citizens to the site of Carthage, for the purpose of its
restoration. From this, however, he was terrified by
a dream.</p>

<p>It seems probable, nevertheless that a few buildings
began to spring up among the ruins. Julius C&aelig;sar
determined on rebuilding it, in consequence of having
beheld, in a dream, a numerous army, weeping at the
fate of Carthage. His death prevented the fulfilment
of his purpose. Augustus, however, sent three thousand
Romans thither, or rather, within a short distance
of it, who were joined by the inhabitants of the
neighbouring country.</p>

<p>From this time it appears to have increased in
beauty, convenience, and the number of its inhabitants.</p>

<p>In the early part of the fifth century, however,
Genseric having invaded Africa, the whole of the
fruitful provinces, from Tangier to Tripoli, were
in succession overwhelmed, and Carthage was surprised,
five hundred and eighty-five years after its
destruction by the younger Scipio.</p>

<p>At this time, we are told<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>, Carthage was considered
as the "Rome" of the African world. It contained
the arms, the manufactures, and the treasures
of six provinces; schools and gymnasia were instituted
for the education of youth; and the liberal
arts were publicly taught in the Greek and Latin
languages.</p>

<p>The buildings were uniform and magnificent; a
shady grove was planted in the midst of the city;
the new port, a secure and capacious harbour, was
subservient to the commercial industry of citizens
and strangers; and the splendid games of the circus
and the theatre were exhibited.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>After Genseric had permitted his licentious troops
to satiate their rage and avarice, he promulgated an
edict, which enjoined all persons to deliver up their
gold, silver, jewels, and valuable furniture and apparel,
to the royal officers; and the attempt to secrete
any part of their patrimony was punished with torture
and death, as an act of treason against the state.</p>

<p>Carthage never recovered this blow, and it fell
gradually into such insignificance, that it disappeared
altogether from the records of history.</p>

<p>We now select a few passages from Mons. Chateaubriand
and Sir George Temple, in respect to its
present condition.</p>

<p>"The ship in which I left Alexandria," says the
former, "having arrived in the port of Tunis, we
cast anchor opposite to the ruins of Carthage. I
looked at them, but was unable to make out what they
could be. I perceived a few Moorish huts, a Mahommedan
hermitage at the point of a projecting cape;
sheep browsing among the ruins&mdash;ruins so far from
striking, that I could scarcely distinguish them from
the ground on which they lay&mdash;this was Carthage.
In order to distinguish these ruins, it is necessary to
go methodically to work. I suppose then that the
reader sets out with me from the port of Goltetha,
standing upon the canal by which the lake of Tunis
discharges itself into the sea. Riding along the shore
in an east-north-east direction, you come in about
half an hour to some salt-pits of the sea. You begin
to discover jetties running out to a considerable distance
under water. The sea and jetties are on your
right; on your left you perceive a great quantity of
ruins upon eminences of unequal height, and below
these ruins is a basin of circular form and of considerable
depth, which formerly communicated with
the sea by means of a canal, traces of which are still
to be seen. This basin must be, in my opinion, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Cothon or inner port of Carthage. The remains of
the immense works, discernible in the sea, would, in
this case, indicate the site of the outer mole. If I
am not mistaken, some piles of the dam, constructed
by Scipio, for the purpose of blocking up the port,
may still be distinguished. I also observed a second
inner canal, which may have been the cut, made by
the Carthaginians when they opened a new passage
for their fleet."</p>

<p>At the foot of the hill at Maallakah<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> are the foundations
of an amphitheatre, the length of which appears
to have been about three hundred feet by two
hundred and thirty, and the dimensions of the arena
one hundred and eighty by one hundred.</p>

<p>There are, also, the ruins of a very extensive edifice,
supposed to have been the temple of Ceres.</p>

<p>Some trifling fragments of edifices, and the traces
of its triple walls, are all that remain of the Byrsa's
splendid fanes and palaces; though many pieces of rare
marbles have been found, as serpentine, giallo, rosso,
and porphyry. Nor is there any remain of the
famous temple of &AElig;sculapius, the approach to which
was by a magnificent flight of steps, and rendered so
interesting from having been the place in whose
flames Asdrubal's wife destroyed herself, her children,
and nine hundred Roman deserters, rather than submit
to the yoke of the haughty vanquishers of her
country.</p>

<p>Sir George Temple's observations are very beautiful:&mdash;"Early
in the morning, I walked to the
site of the great Carthage&mdash;of that town, at the
sound of whose name mighty Rome herself had
so often trembled&mdash;of Carthage, the mistress of
powerful and brave armies, of numerous fleets, and
of the world's commerce, and to whom Africa, Spain,
Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily, and Italy herself, bowed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
submission as to their sovereign;&mdash;in short, 'Carthago,
dives opum, studiisque asperrima belli.' I
was prepared to see but few vestiges of its former
grandeur; it had so often suffered from the devastating
effects of war, that I knew many could not
exist: but my heart sunk within me, when, ascending
one of its hills, (from whose summit the eye embraces
a view of the whole surrounding country to
the edge of the sea,) I beheld nothing more than
a few scattered and shapeless masses of masonry<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>.
Yes, all the vestiges of the splendour and magnificence
of the mighty city had, indeed, passed away,
and its very name is now unknown to the present
inhabitants<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>."</p>

<h2><a name="NO_XXIV_CATANEA" id="NO_XXIV_CATANEA"></a>NO. XXIV.&mdash;CATANEA.</h2>


<p>This city, situated at the foot of Mount Etna, was
founded by a colony from Chalcis, seven hundred and
fifty-three years before the Christian era; and soon
after the settlement of Syracuse. There have not
been wanting some, however, to assert that ancient
Catanea was one of the oldest cities in the world.</p>

<p>It fell into the hands of the Romans, and became
the residence of a pr&aelig;tor.</p>

<p>It was then adorned with sumptuous buildings of
all kinds. It was destroyed, however, by Pompey;
and restored by Augustus with greater magnificence.
It was large and opulent. Being so contiguous
to Mount Etna, it is rendered remarkable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
for the fatal overthrows to which it has been subjected
by the eruptions of that mountain; in some of
which it has been known to discharge a stream of
lava four miles broad and fifty feet deep, and advancing
at the rate of seven miles in a day.</p>

are 81.</p>

<p>In 1693 Catanea was entirely destroyed by an
earthquake, so that hardly one stone remained upon
another. It began on the 9th January, and on the
11th the earth opened in several places. Almost in
a moment 11,000 persons, who had fled to the
cathedral for shelter, perished by its fall; the canon,
with the ministers at the altar, and about one
hundred persons, being all that escaped. The
undulations of this shock were felt, it is said, in
Germany, France, and even in England. Fifty-four
towns of some magnitude were, more or less, sufferers
by this earthquake, and the total loss of human life,
it is supposed, amounted to nearly one hundred
thousand.</p>

<p>"The present town," says Malte Brun, "is well
built. Its fine edifices are so many proofs, not of its
prosperity, but of its misfortunes; for, in Catanea,
houses never become old; they give way either to
lava or volcanic shocks. It is to the earthquakes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
1693 and 1783 that it owes its magnificence; almost
wholly destroyed, it was rebuilt with greater regularity.
Most of its edifices, however, have been
injured by the shocks in 1819."</p>

<p>A great many antiquities are contained in the
Biscari Museum, which was founded by a wealthy
noble of the same name, who spent his fortune in
exploring or digging for antiquities in the territory of
Catanea. The ancient theatre and amphitheatre, the
old walls, baths, and temples, were buried under
several layers of lava and alluvial deposits, that were
removed by the same individual; lastly, the town
is indebted to him for several ancient statues.</p>

<p>"There are many remains of antiquity," says Mr.
Brydone, "but most of them are in a very ruinous
state. One of the most remarkable is an elephant of
lava, with an obelisk of Egyptian granite on his back.
There are also considerable remains of a great theatre,
besides that belonging to the prince of Biscaris,
a large bath, almost entire; the ruins of a great
aqueduct eighteen miles long; the ruins of several
temples, one of Ceres; another of Vulcan. The
church, called Bocca di Fuoco, was likewise a temple.
But the most entire of all is a small rotunda,
which, as well as the rotunda at Rome, and some
others to be met with in Italy, demonstrates that
form to be the most durable of any."</p>

<p>There is also a well at the foot of the old walls,
where the lava, after running along the parapet, and
and then falling forwards, produced a very complete
and lofty arch over the spring.</p>

<p>Through the care, and at the expense of prince
Biscaris, many other monuments of ancient splendour
and magnificence have been recovered by digging
down to the ancient town, which, on account of the

<p>Mr. Swinburne states, that he descended into baths,
sepulchres, an amphitheatre, and a theatre, all very
much injured by the various catastrophes that have
befallen them. He found, too, that these buildings
were erected not on the solid ground and with brick
or stone, but on old beds of lava, and with square
pieces of the same substance, which, in no instance,
appears to have been fused by the contact of new
lavas: the sciarra or stones of old lava having constantly
proved as strong a barrier against the flowing
torrent of fire as any other stone could have been,
though some authors have been of opinion, that the
hot matter would melt the whole mass, and incorporate
itself with it.</p>

<p>This place, which stands opposite Byzantium, was
built by a colony from Megara, some years before
Byzantium, viz. <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 685. Its position was so imprudently
selected, that it was called the city of blind
men<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>; by which was intimated the inconsiderate
plan of the founders. It was built on a sandy and
barren soil, in preference to the rich one on the opposite
side of the Bosphorus, on which Byzantium was
afterwards founded.</p>

<p>Chalcedon, in the time of its prosperity, was considerable;
not only on account of its buildings, but
the wealth of its inhabitants, who enriched themselves
greatly by commerce; more especially by the ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>portation
of purple dye, which was found in great
quantities upon its coast.</p>

<p>In ancient times it underwent many revolutions;
being first subdued by Otanes, general of
the Persians, whose father Sisanes, one of the judges
of the Persian empire, having pronounced an unjust
sentence, was flayed alive by the order of Cambyses.
Not long after this the Lacedemonians made themselves
masters of it, but were obliged to give place to
the Athenians, who contented themselves with imposing
upon the inhabitants an annual tribute, which
they in time neglecting to pay, were again reduced
to obedience by Alcibiades. Afterwards, with the
rest of the world, it passed under the dominion of
the Romans, who were succeeded by the Greek
emperors, under whose administration it became
famous by a celebrated council of the church (<small>A.&nbsp;D.</small>
327), which is recorded under the name of the council
of Chalcedon.</p>

<p>A tribunal also was here erected by the Emperor
Julian, to try and punish the evil ministers of his
predecessor, Constantius. "We are now delivered,"
said Julian, in a familiar letter to one of his most
intimate friends, "we are now surprisingly delivered
from the voracious jaws of the hydra. I do not
mean to apply that epithet to my brother, Constantius.
He is no more;&mdash;may the earth lie light on
his head! But his artful and cruel favourites studied
to deceive and exasperate a prince, whose natural
mildness cannot be praised without some efforts of
adulation. It is not my intention, however, that
these men should be oppressed; they are accused, and
they shall enjoy the benefit of a fair and impartial
trial." The executions of some of these men, one of
whom (Paulus) was burned alive, were accepted, says
the historian, as an inadequate atonement by the
widows and orphans of so many hundred Romans,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
whom those legal tyrants had betrayed and murdered.</p>

<p>Persians, Greeks, Goths, Saracens, and Turks, by
turns, despoiled Chalcedon. The walls were razed
by Valens, and much of the materials was employed
in the aqueduct of Constantinople that bears his
name, and which was, by a singular coincidence,
repaired by Soliman II., from the remaining ruins of
this devoted city.</p>

<p>Here it was that the infamous Rufinus, so justly
stigmatised by Claudian, built a magnificent villa,
which he called the Oak<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>. He built, also, a church;
and a numerous synod of bishops met in order to
consecrate the wealth and baptise the founder. This
double ceremony was performed with extraordinary
pomp.</p>

<p><small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 602, Chalcedon became remarkable for the
murder of the Emperor Maurice and his five sons;
and afterwards for that of the empress, his widow,
and her three daughters<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>. The ministers of death
were despatched to Chalcedon (by Phocas). They
dragged the emperor into his sanctuary; and the five
sons of Maurice were successively murdered before
the eyes of their agonised parent. At each stroke,
which he felt in his heart, he found strength to rehearse
a pious ejaculation:&mdash;"Thou art just, O Lord!
and thy judgments are righteous."</p>

<p>It is now a small place, known to the Turks by
the name of Cadiaci; but the Greeks still call it
by its ancient name. It is a miserable village, inhabited
by a few Greeks, who maintain themselves by
their fishery, and the cultivation of their lands.
Wheler found an inscription, importing that Evante,
the son of Antipater, having made a prosperous
voyage towards the Abrotanians and the islands
Cyane&aelig;, and hence desiring to return by the &AElig;gean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
Sea and Pontus, offered cakes to the statue he had
erected to Jupiter, who had sent him good weather
as a token of a good voyage.</p>

<p>Pococke says, "There are no remains of the ancient
city, all being destroyed, and the ground occupied
by gardens and vineyards." "We visited the site of
Chalcedon," says Dr. Clarke, "of which city scarcely
a trace remains; landing also upon the remarkable
rock, where the light-house is situate, called the
tower of Leander. The Turks call it the 'Maiden's
Castle;' possibly it may have been formerly used as
a retreat for nuns, but they relate one of their romantic
traditions concerning a princess, who secluded
herself upon this rock, because it had been foretold
she should die by the bite of a serpent, adding, that
she ultimately here encountered the death she sought
to avoid<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>."</p>

<h2><a name="NO_XXVI_CHAERONEA" id="NO_XXVI_CHAERONEA"></a>NO. XXVI.&mdash;CH&AElig;RONEA.</h2>


<p>A city in B&#339;otia, greatly celebrated on account
of a battle fought near it between Philip of Macedon
and the Athenians.</p>

<p>The two armies encamped near Ch&aelig;ronea. Philip
gave the command of his left wing to his son
Alexander, who was then but sixteen. He took the
right wing upon himself. In the opposite army the
Thebans formed the right wing, and the Athenians
the left. At sunrise the signal was given on both
sides. The battle was bloody, and the victory a
long time dubious; both sides exerting themselves
with astonishing valour. At length Philip broke
the sacred band of the Thebans<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>, which was the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
flower of their army. The rest of the troops being
raw, Alexander, encouraged by his example, entirely
routed.</p>

<p>The conduct of the victor after this victory shows
that it is much easier to overcome an enemy than to
conquer one's self. Upon his coming from a grand
entertainment which he had given his officers, being
equally transported with joy and wine, he hurried to
the spot where the battle had been fought, and there,
insulting the dead bodies with which the field was
covered, he turned into a song the beginning of the
decree, which Demosthenes had prepared to excite
the Greeks to war, and sang thus, himself beating
time; "Demosthenes the Peanian, son of Demosthenes,
has said." Everybody was shocked to see
the king dishonour himself by this behaviour; but
no one opened his lips. Demades, the orator, whose
soul was free, though his body was a prisoner, was
the only person who ventured to make him sensible
of the indecency of this conduct, telling him&mdash;"Ah,
sir, since fortune has given you the part of Agamemnon,
are you not ashamed to act the part of
Thersites?" These words, spoken with so generous
a liberty, opened his eyes, and made him turn inward;
and so far from being displeased with
Demades, he esteemed him the more for them,
treated him with the utmost respect, and conferred
upon him all possible honours.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>The bones of those slain at Ch&aelig;ronea were carried
to Athens; and Demosthenes was charged with composing
a eulogium, for a monument erected to their
memory:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
This earth entombs those victims to the state,<br />
Who fell a glorious sacrifice to zeal.<br />
Greece, on the point of wearing tyrant-chains,<br />
Did, by their deaths alone, escape the yoke.<br />
This Jupiter decreed: no effort, mortals,<br />
Can save you from the mighty will of fate.<br />
To gods alone belongs the attribute<br />
Of being free from crimes with never-ending joy.<br />
</p>

<p>According to Procopius, Ch&aelig;ronea and other places
in B&#339;otia (also of Achaia and Thessaly) were destroyed
by an earthquake in the sixth century.</p>

<p>The Acropolis<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> is situated on a steep rock, difficult
of access; the walls and square towers are, in
some places, well preserved; and their style, which is
nearly regular, renders it probable, that they were
constructed not long before the invasion of the
Macedonians.</p>

<p>The ancient Necropolis is on the east side of the
Acropolis, behind the village: the remains of several
tombs have been uncovered by the rains. The
church of the Holy Virgin contains an ancient chair
of white marble, curiously ornamented. It is called
by the villagers the throne of Plutarch<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>.</p>

<p>There are two ancient circular altars with fluted
intervals, in the manner of an Ionic or Corinthian
column. Altars of this kind were placed on the
road side. They were unstained with fire and blood,
being set apart for exclusive oblations of honey,
cakes, and fruit. These altars are common in Greece,
and generally formed of coarse black stone; those of
Ch&aelig;ronea, however, are of white marble. They are
frequently found in Italy, and are at present used as
pedestals for large vases, their height being in general<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
about three feet. They are never inscribed, and
sometimes not fluted; and are frequently represented
on painted terra-cotta vases.</p>

<p>Some Ionic fragments of small proportions are
scattered among the ruins. On the rock there was
anciently a statue of Jupiter; but Pausanias mentions
no temple. The theatre stands at the foot of
the Acropolis, and faces the plain. It is the smallest
in Greece, except one at Mesaloggion; but it is well
preserved. Indeed, nothing is better calculated to
resist the devastations of time than the Grecian
theatres, when they are cut in the rock, as they
generally are.</p>

<p>"The sole remains of this town," says Sir John
Hobhouse, "are some large stones six feet in length,
and the ruins of a wall on the hill, and part of a shaft of
a column, with its capital; the seats of a small amphitheatre,
cut out of the rock, on the side of the same
hill; in the flat below, a fountain, partly constructed
of marble fragments, containing a few letters, not
decipherable; some bits of marble pillars, just appearing
above ground, and the ruins of a building of
Roman brick."</p>

<p>Two inscriptions have, we understand, lately been
discovered at this place; one relative to Apollo, the
other to Diana. Several tombs have been also discovered
and opened.</p>

<p>Though a respectable traveller asserts, that the
battle of Ch&aelig;ronea, by putting an end to the turbulent
independence of the Grecian republics, introduced
into that country an unusual degree of civil tranquillity
and political repose, we cannot ourselves
think so; we therefore subjoin, from Dr. Leland, a
short account of the conqueror's death.</p>

<p>"When the Greeks and Macedonians were seated
in the theatre, Philip came out of his palace, attended
by the two Alexanders, his son and son-in-law. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
was clothed in a white flowing robe, waving in soft
and graceful folds, the habiliment in which the
Grecian deities were usually represented. He moved
forward with a heart filled with triumph and exultation,
while the admiring crowds shouted forth their
flattering applause. His guards had orders to keep
at a considerable distance from his person, to show
that the king confided in the affections of his people,
and had not the least apprehensions of danger amidst
all this mixed concourse of different states and nations.
Unhappily, the danger was but too near him.
The injured Pausanias had not yet forgot his wrongs,
but still retained those terrible impressions, which
the sense of an indignity he had received, and the
artful and interested representations of others, fixed
deeply in his mind. He chose this fatal morning for
the execution of his revenge, on the prince who had
denied reparation to his injured honour. His design
had been for some time premeditated, and now was
the dreadful moment of effecting it. As Philip
marched on in all his pride and pomp, this young
Macedonian slipped through the crowd, and, with a
desperate and malignant resolution, waited his approach
in a narrow passage, just at the entrance into
the theatre. The king advanced towards him: Pausanias
drew his poniard; plunged it into his heart;
and the conqueror of Greece, and terror of Asia, fell
prostrate to the ground, and instantly expired<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="NO_XXVII_CORDUBA" id="NO_XXVII_CORDUBA"></a>NO. XXVII.&mdash;CORDUBA.</h2>


<p>"Are we at Cordova?" says a modern writer.
"The whole reign of the Omniad Caliphs passes, in
mental review, before us. Once the seat of Arabian
art, gallantry, and magnificence, the southern kingdom
of Spain was rich and flourishing. Agriculture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
was respected; the fine arts cultivated; gardens
were formed; roads executed; palaces erected; and
physics, geometry, and astronomy, advanced. The
inhabitants were active and industrious; accomplishments
were held in esteem; and the whole state of
society formed a striking contrast to that of every
other in Europe."</p>

<p>It was situated in Hispanic B&#339;tica, having been
built by Marcellus. It was the native place of both
the Senecas, and Lucan. Indeed, it produced, in
ancient times, so many celebrated characters, that it
was styled the "mother of men of genius." Its
laws were written in verse; and its academy was
partly distinguished for its cultivation of the Greek
language, as well as for rhetoric and philosophy. It
became celebrated, also, under the Moors.</p>

<p>Of its ancient grandeur, however, Cordova has
preserved nothing but a vast inclosure, filled with
houses, half in ruins. Its long, narrow, and ill-paved
streets are almost deserted; most of the houses are
uninhabited; and the multitude of churches and convents
which it contains, are besieged by a crowd of
vagabonds, covered with rags. The ancient palace
of the Moors has been converted into stables, in
which, till within these few years, one hundred Andalusian
horses were usually kept. Their genealogy
was carefully preserved; and the name and age of
each written over the stall in which he stood. In
the place appropriated to bathing, is part of a Cufic
inscription.</p>

<p>Cordova was called at first Corduba, and afterwards
Colonia Patricia, as appears from inscriptions
on the numerous medals which have been discovered
in this city and neighbourhood.</p>

<p>From the Romans it passed successively under the
dominion of the Goths and Arabs; and, while the
latter swayed the sceptre of Spain, Cordova became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
pre-eminently distinguished, as we have just stated,
as the seat of arts, sciences, and literature.</p>

<p>About ten miles from this place is a small town,
called by the ancients Obubea<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>; and we mention
it here merely because it reminds us that Julius
C&aelig;sar came thither to stop the progress of Pompey's
sons, who had a little before entered Spain in twenty-seven

<h2><a name="NO_XXVIII_CORCYRA_CORFU" id="NO_XXVIII_CORCYRA_CORFU"></a>NO. XXVIII.&mdash;CORCYRA. (CORFU.)</h2>


<p>Corcyra is an island in the Ionian Sea, on the coast
of Epirus: it is now called Corfu; was first peopled by
a colony from Colchis, <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 1349, and afterwards by a
colony from Corinth, who, with Chersicrates at their
head, came to settle there, on being banished from their
native city 703 years before the Christian era.
Homer calls it Ph&aelig;acia; Callimachus, Drepane.</p>

<p>Ancient authors give glorious descriptions of the
beautiful gardens of this island belonging to Alcinous;
but, at present, no remains of them are to be found.
It was famous for the shipwreck of Ulysses.</p>

<p>The air is healthy, the land fertile, the fruit excellent.
Oranges, citrons, honey, wax, oil, and most
delicious grapes, are very abundant.</p>

<p>The war between this people and that of Athens
was called the Corcyrean; and operated as an intro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>duction
to the Peloponnesian war. Corcyra was then
an independent power, which could send out fleets
and armies; and its alliance was courted by many
other states.</p>

<p>Thucydides gives a frightful account of a sedition
which occurred in this city and island during the
Peloponnesian war: some were condemned to die
under judicial sentences; some slew one another in
the temples; some hung themselves upon the trees
within its verge; some perished through private
enmity; some for the sums they had lent, by the
hands of the borrowers. Every kind of death was
exhibited. Every dreadful act, usual in a sedition,
and more than usual, was then perpetrated. For
fathers slew their children; some were dragged from
altars; and some were butchered at them; and a
number died of starvation in one of the temples.</p>

<p>Corcyra, when in the possession of the Romans,
became a valuable station for their ships of war, in
their hostilities against the cities of Asia. Septimius
Severus and his family appear to have been great
benefactors to it; for, about 150 years ago, there was
found a number of medals, not only of Septimius,
but of his wife Julia Domna; Caracalla, his eldest
son, and his wife Plankilla; also of Geta, his youngest
son.</p>

<p>Two hundred years ago, Corfu consisted of nothing
but one old castle and a village. It is now a considerable
town. It stands projecting on a rock into
the sea; and, from the fortifications guarding it, is a
place of strength. The fortresses are completely
mined below; and the roads to the gates of some of
them are narrow and precipitous. By an accidental
explosion of a powder-mill, one of the fortresses, in
the early part of the last century, 2000 people were
killed and wounded; and by a singular catastrophe,
in 1789, 600 individuals lost their lives; ten galleys<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
and several boats were sunk in the harbour; and
many houses in the town greatly damaged.</p>

<p>Wheler visited the ruins of Pal&#339;opoli, the
ancient metropolis of the island. "It stood," says he,
"on a promontory to the south of the present city,
separated from it by a little bay, of about a mile or
two over. The abundance of ruins and fortifications,
which are to be seen there, do sufficiently prove it to
have been so." Abundance of foundations, he goes on
to observe, have been dug up there; and of arches and
pillars, many of which have been employed to build
the foundations of the present city.</p>

<p>There are also the remains of an old place of worship;
the architecture of which is sustained by
Corinthian columns of white marble, with an inscription,
showing that it was built by the Emperor Jovian,
after he was converted to the Christian faith and had
destroyed the heathen temples.</p>

<p>"<i>I Jovian, having received the faith, established
the kingdom of my power; and having destroyed the
heathen temples and altars, have built to thee, O thou
blessed and most high King, a holy temple, the gift of an
unworthy hand.</i>"</p>

<p>Mr. Dodwell visited this place some years ago, and
he says that nothing is now seen above ground of the
remains of the ancient city, except some frusta of
large columns, which from having flutings without intervals,
were evidently of the Doric order. They have
a large square, which forms but one mass with a
column, which is a singularity, it is said, of which
there is no other example.</p>

<p>Corcyra was celebrated, as we have before stated,
for having been the island on which Ulysses is represented
in the Odyssey as having been entertained by
Alcinous, king of Ph&aelig;acia. It is also the place where
Cicero and Cato met after the battle of Pharsalia; and
where Cato, after having intrusted Cicero to take the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
command of the last legions which remained faithful
to the republic, separated from him to lose his life at
Utica, while Cicero went to lose his head to the triumvirate.
To this place Aristotle was once exiled; and
it is well known as having been visited by the youthful
Alexander; as the place where the tragical nuptials
of Antony and Cleopatra were celebrated; and as
that where Agrippina touched, bringing from Egypt
the body of the murdered Germanicus in the midst
of winter<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>.</p>

<p>This city was situated at the foot of a hill, on
which stood the citadel. To the south it was defended
by the hill itself, which is there extremely
steep. Strong and lofty ramparts protected it on
three sides. Corinth was at first subject to the
kings of Argos and Mycen&aelig;; at last Sisyphus made
himself master of it. But his descendants were
dispossessed of the throne by the Heraclid&aelig;, about
ten years after the siege of Troy. The regal power,
after this, came to the descendants of Bacchis, under
whom the monarchy was changed into an aristocracy;
that is, the reins of government were in the
hands of the elders, who annually chose from
amongst themselves a chief magistrate, whom they
called Prytanis. At length Cypselus, having gained
the people, usurped the supreme authority, which
he transmitted to his son Periander.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>The most celebrated of the Corinthians was a person,
who though a tyrant, was reckoned one of the
seven wise men (Periander). When he had first made
himself master of the city, he wrote to Thrasybulus,
tyrant of Miletus, to know what measures he should
take with his newly-acquired subjects. The latter,
without any answer, led the messenger into a field
of wheat; where, in walking along, he beat down
with his cane all the ears of corn that were higher
than the rest. Periander perfectly well understood
the meaning of this enigmatical answer, which was a
tacit intimation to him, that, in order to secure his
own life, he should cut off the most eminent of the
Corinthian citizens. Periander, however, did not
relish so cruel an advice.</p>

<p>He wrote circular letters to all the wise men, inviting
them to pass some time with him at Corinth,
as they had done the year before at Sardis with
Cr&#339;sus. Princes in those days thought themselves
much honoured when they could have such guests in
their houses. Plutarch describes an entertainment
which Periander gave these illustrious guests, and
observes, at the same time, that the decent simplicity
of it, adapted to the taste and humour of the persons
entertained, did him much more honour than the
greatest magnificence could have done. The subject
of their discourse at table was sometimes grave and
serious, at other times pleasant and gay. One of the
company proposed this question;&mdash;Which is the
most perfect popular government? That, answered
Solon, where an injury, done to any private citizen, is
such to the whole body: That, said Bias, where the
law has no superior: That, said Thales, where the
inhabitants are neither too rich nor too poor: That,
said Anacharsis, where virtue is honoured, and vice
detested: Says Pittacus, where dignities are always
conferred upon the virtuous, and never upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
wicked: Says Cleobulus, where the citizens fear
blame, more than punishment: Says Chilo, where
the laws are more regarded, and have more authority,
than the orators. From all these opinions Periander
concluded, that the most perfect popular government
would be that which came nearest to aristocracy,
where the sovereign authority is lodged in the hands
of a few men of honour and virtue.</p>

<p>This city standing between two seas, an attempt
was made by Periander, and afterwards by Alexander,
Demetrius, Julius C&aelig;sar, Caligula, Nero, and
Herodes Atticus, to unite them; but they all failed
in the attempt.</p>

<p>Strabo was in Corinth after its restoration by the
Romans. He describes the site, and says, that its
circuit occupied five miles. From the summit of
the Sisyph&eacute;um, he continues, is beheld to the north
Parnassus and Helicon, lofty mountains covered
with snow; and below both, to the west, the Criss&aelig;an
gulf, bounded by Phocis, by B&#339;otia and the
Megaris, and by Corinthia and Sicyonia. Beyond
all these are the Oneian mountains, stretching as far
as Cith&aelig;ron.</p>

<p>Corinth had temples dedicated to the Egyptian
Isis, to Serapis, and Serapis of Canopus. Fortune,
also, had a temple, and her statue was made of Persian
work; and near this temple was another, dedicated
to the mother of all the gods.</p>

<p>Besides the citadel, built upon the mountain, the
works of art, which chiefly displayed the opulence
and taste of the people, were the grottoes, raised
over the fountain of Pyrene, sacred to the Muses,
and constructed of white marble. There were, also,
a theatre and stadium, built of the same materials,
and decorated in the most magnificent manner; also
a temple of Neptune, containing the chariots of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
god, and of Amphitrite, drawn by horses covered
over with gold, and adorned with ivory hoofs.</p>

<p>There were a multitude of statues, also; amongst
which were those of Bacchus, and Diana of Ephesus.
These were of wood; others were of bronze; amongst
which were those of Apollo Clarius; a Venus by
Hermogenes of Cythera; two Mercuries; three
statues of Jupiter; and a Minerva. This last was
mounted on a pedestal, the basso-relievos of which
represented the Nine Muses.</p>

<p>Such, indeed, were its wealth, magnificence, and
excellent situation, that it was thought by the
Romans equally worthy of empire with Carthage
and Capua; and this induces me to say a few words
in regard to its war with the Romans.</p>

<p>Metellus<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> having received advice in Macedonia of
the troubles in Peloponnesus, departed thither with
Romans of distinction, who arrived in Corinth at
the time the council was assembled there. They
spoke in it with abundance of moderation, exhorting
the Achaians not to draw upon themselves, by imprudent
levity and weakness, the resentment of the
Romans. They were treated with contempt, and
ignominiously turned out of the assembly. An
innumerable crowd of workmen and artificers rose
about them, and insulted them. All the cities of
Achaia were at the time in a kind of delirium; but
Corinth was far more frantic than the rest, and
abandoned themselves to a kind of madness. They
had been persuaded that Rome intended to enslave
them all, and absolutely to destroy the Achaian
league.</p>

<p>The Romans, having chosen Mummius for one of
the consuls, charged him with the management of
the Achaian war. When Mummius had assembled
all his troops, he advanced to the city, and encamped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
before it. A body of his advanced guard being negligent
of duty upon their post, the besieged made a
sally, attacked them vigorously, killed many, and
pursued the rest almost to the entrance of their camp.
This small advantage very much encouraged the
Achaians, and thereby proved fatal to them. Di&aelig;us
offered the consul battle. The latter, to augment his
rashness, kept his troops within the camp, as if fear
prevented him from accepting it. The joy and presumption
of the Achaians rose in consequence to an
inexpressible height. They advanced furiously with
all their troops, having placed their wives and children
upon the neighbouring eminence, to be spectators of
the battle, and caused a great number of carriages to
follow them, to be laden with the booty they should
take from the enemy; so fully did they assure themselves
of the victory.</p>

<p>Never was there a more rash or ill-founded confidence.
The faction had removed from the service
and councils all such as were capable of commanding
the troops, or conducting affairs; and had substituted
others in their room, without either talents or ability,
in order to their being more absolutely masters of
the government, and ruling without opposition.
The chiefs, without military knowledge, valour, or
experience, had no other merit than a blind and
frantic rage. They had already committed an excess
of folly in hazarding a battle, which was to decide
their fate, without necessity, instead of thinking of a
long and brave defence in so strong a place as
Corinth, and of obtaining good conditions by a vigorous
resistance. The battle was fought near Leucopetra,
and the defile of the isthmus. The consul
had posted part of his horse in ambuscade, which
they quitted at a proper time for charging the
Achaian cavalry in flank; who, surprised by an
unforeseen attack, gave way immediately. The in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>fantry
made a little more resistance; but, as it was
neither covered, nor sustained by the horse, it was
soon broken and put to flight. Di&aelig;us, upon this,
abandoned himself to despair. He rode full speed
to Megalopolis, and having entered his house, set
fire to it; killed his wife, to prevent her falling into
the hands of the enemy; drank poison; and in that
manner put an end to his life, worthy of the many
crimes he had committed.</p>

<p>After this defeat, the inhabitants lost all hope of
defending themselves; so that all the Achaians who
had retired into Corinth, and most of the citizens,
quitted it the following night, to save themselves
how they could. The consul having entered the city,
abandoned it to be plundered by the soldiers. All
the men who were left in it were put to the sword,
and the women and children sold; and after the
statues, paintings, and richest moveables were removed,
in order to their being carried to Rome, the
houses were set on fire, and the whole city continued
in flames for several days. From that time
the Corinthian brass became more valuable than ever,
though it had been in reputation long before. It is
pretended that the gold, silver, and brass, which were
melted, and ran together in this conflagration,
formed a new and precious metal. The walls were
afterwards desolated, and razed to their very foundations.
All this was executed by order of the Senate,
to punish the insolence of the Corinthians, who had
violated the law of nations, in their treatment of the
ambassadors sent to them by Rome.</p>

<p>The booty taken at Corinth was sold, and considerable
sums raised from it. Amongst the paintings
there was a piece drawn by the most celebrated
hand in Greece, representing Bacchus, the beauty of
which was not known to the Romans, who were at
that time entirely ignorant of the polite arts. Poly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>bius,
who was then in the country, had the mortification
to see the painting serve the soldiers for a table
to play at dice upon. It was afterwards sold to
Attalus for &pound;3625 sterling. Pliny mentions another
picture by the same painter, which the same Attalus
purchased for 110 talents. The consul, surprised that
the price of the painting in question should rise so
high, interposed his authority, and retained it contrary
to public faith, and notwithstanding the complaints
of Attalus, because he imagined there was
some hidden virtue in the prize, unknown to him.
He did not act in that manner for his private interest,
nor with the view of appropriating it to himself, as
he sent it to Rome, to be applied in adorning the
city. When it arrived at Rome, it was set up in
the temple of Ceres, whither the judges went to
see it out of curiosity, as a masterpiece of art;
and it remained there till it was burned with that
temple.</p>

<p>Mummius was a great warrior, and an excellent
man; but he had neither learning, knowledge of arts,
nor taste for painting or sculpture. He ordered particular
persons to take care of transporting many
of the paintings and statues of the most excellent
masters to Rome. Never had loss been so irreparable,
as that of such a deposite, consisting of the
masterpieces of those rare artists, who contributed
almost as much as the great captains, to the rendering
of their age glorious to posterity. Mummius, however,
in recommending the care of that precious collection
to those to whom he confided them, threatened
them very seriously, that if the statues, paintings,
and other things with which he charged them, should
be either lost or destroyed by the way, he would
oblige them to find others at their own cost<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>;&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
saying deservedly ridiculed by all persons of sense, as
a most egregious solecism in taste and delicacy<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>.</p>

<p>It is amusing to observe the difference between
Mummius and Scipio;&mdash;the one the conqueror of
Corinth, the other of Carthage; both in the same
year<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>. Scipio, to the courage and virtue of ancient
heroes, joined a profound knowledge of the sciences,
with all the genius and ornaments of wit. His patronage
was courted by every one who made any
figure in learning. Pan&aelig;tius, whom Tully calls the
prince of the Stoics, and Polybius the historian, were
his bosom friends, the assisters of his studies at home,
and the constant companions of his expeditions
abroad. To which may be added, that he passed the
more agreeable hours of his life in the conversation of
Terence, and is even thought to have taken part in
the composition of his comedies.</p>

<p>The period in which the Isthmian games were to
be celebrated being at hand, the expectation of what
was to be transacted drew thither an incredible
multitude of people, and persons of the highest
rank. The conditions of peace, which were not
yet entirely made public, were the topic of all
conversations, and various constructions were put
upon them; but very few could be persuaded that
the Romans would evacuate all the cities they
had taken. All Greece was in this uncertainty,
when the multitude being assembled in the stadium
to see the games, a herald comes forward, and
publishes with a loud voice:&mdash;"The senate and
people of Rome, and Titus Quintius the general,
having overcome Philip and the Macedonians, ease
and deliver from all garrisons and taxes and im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>posts,
the Corinthians, the Locrians, the Phocians,
the Eub&#339;ans, the Phthiot Achaians, the Magnesians,
the Thessalians, and the Perrh&#339;bians; declare
them free, and ordain that they shall be governed
by their respective laws and usages."</p>

<p>At these words all the spectators were filled with
excessive joy. They gazed upon and questioned one
another with astonishment, and could not believe
either eyes or ears; so like a dream was what they
saw and heard. But being at last assured of their
happiness, they abandoned themselves again to the
highest transports of joy, and broke out into such loud
acclamations, that the sea resounded them to a distance;
and some ravens, which happened to fly that
instant over the assembly, fell down into the stadium;
so true it is, that of all the blessings of this life,
none are so dear as that of liberty!</p>

<p>Corinth, nevertheless, remained after this in a
ruined and desolate state many years. At length,
C&aelig;sar, after he had subdued Africa, and while his
fleet lay at anchor at Utica, gave order for rebuilding
Carthage; and soon after his return to Italy,
he likewise caused Corinth to be rebuilt. Strabo
and Plutarch agree in ascribing the rebuilding of
Carthage and Corinth to Julius C&aelig;sar; and Plutarch
remarks this singular circumstance with regard
to these cities, viz.&mdash;that as they were taken and
destroyed in the same year, they were rebuilt and
repeopled at the same time.</p>

<p>Under the eastern emperors, Corinth was the see
of an archbishop, subject to the patriarch of Constantinople.
Roger, king of Naples, obtained possession
of it under the empire of Emanuel. It had,
afterwards, its own sovereign, who ceded it to the
Venetians; from whom it was taken by Mahomet
II., <small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 1458. The Venetians retook it in 1687,
and held it till the year 1715, when they lost it to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
the Turks, in whose possession it remained till, a few
years since, Greece was erected into an independent
state. The grand army of the Turks<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> (in 1715)
under the prime vizier, to open themselves a way
into the heart of the Morea, attacked Corinth, upon
which they made several attacks. The garrison being
weakened, and the governor, seeing it was impossible
to hold out against a force so superior to
their own, beat a parley; but while they were treating
about the articles, one of the magazines in the
Turkish camp, wherein they had 600 barrels of
powder, blew up by accident, whereby between 600
and 700 men were killed; which so enraged the infidels,
that they would not grant any capitulation,
but stormed the place with so much fury that they
took it, and put most of the garrison, with the
governor, Signior Minotti, to the sword. The rest
they made prisoners of war. This subject formed
the foundation of Lord Byron's poem of the Siege of
Corinth.</p>

<p>The natural consequences of an extensive commerce
were wealth and luxury. Fostered in this
manner, the city rose in magnificence and grandeur;
and the elegant and magnificent temples, palaces,
theatres, and other buildings, adorned with statues,
columns, capitals, and bases, not only rendered it
the pride of its inhabitants and the admiration of
strangers, but gave rise to that order of architecture
which still bears its name.</p>

<p>Corinth has preserved but few monuments of its
Greek or Roman citizens. The chief remains are at
the southern corner of the town, and above the bazaar;
eleven columns, supporting their architraves, of the
Doric order, fluted, and wanting in height near half
the common proportion to the diameter. Within
them, to the western end, is one taller, though entire,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
which, it is likely, contributed to sustain the roof.
They are of stone. This ruin is probably of great
antiquity, and a portion of a fabric, erected mostly
before the Greek city was destroyed, but before the
Doric order had attained to maturity.</p>

<p>Mr. Dodwell, nevertheless, observed no remains of
the order of architecture which is said to have been
invented at Corinth, nor did he perceive in any part
of the isthmus the acanthus plant, which forms the
principal distinctive character of the Corinthian
capital.</p>

<p>Corinth<sup>*</sup>, says Mr. Turner, contains, within its
walls, remains of antiquity, but some small masses of
ruined walls and seven columns, with part of the frieze
of a temple, of which some columns were pulled down
to make room for a Turkish house to which it joins.</p>

<p>As there is nothing approaching to an intelligible
building of antiquity, we may exclaim with the
poet&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
Where is thy grandeur, Corinth! shrunk from sight,<br />
Thy ancient treasures, and thy ramparts' height,<br />
Thy god-like fanes and palaces! Oh where,<br />
Thy mighty myriads and majestic fair!<br />
Relentless war has poured around thy wall,<br />
And hardly spared the traces of thy fall.<br />
</p>

<p>There are several shapeless and uninteresting
masses of Roman remains composed of bricks, one of
which seems to have been a bath, resembling, in
some respects, that of Dioclesian at Rome, but
little more than the lower walls and foundations are
remaining. The only Grecian ruin which, at present,
remains at Corinth, is that of a Doric temple.
When Du Loir travelled there (1654), there were
twelve columns of this temple standing. In the time
of Chandler there were also eleven; but now there
are only seven. To what god this temple was dedicated
is unknown. The columns are each composed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>of one black calcareous stone, which being of a porous
quality, were anciently covered with stucco of great
hardness and durability. From its massive and inelegant
proportions, Mr. Dodwell is disposed to
believe, that this ruin is the most ancient remaining
in Greece.</p>

<p>In the narrowest part of the isthmus, about three
miles from Corinth, and therefore probably in the
place where the games were celebrated, are seen the
spacious remains of a theatre and stadium; and less
than a mile from Corinth, in the same direction, the
circuit and arena are still visible.</p>

<p>The Acropolis, however, is one of the finest objects
in Greece, and before the introduction of artillery, it
was deemed almost impregnable, and had never been
taken except by treachery or surprise. In the time
of Aratus it was defended only by four hundred soldiers,
fifty dogs, and fifty keepers. It shoots up
majestically from the plain to a considerable height,
and forms a conspicuous object at a great distance;
as it is clearly seen from Athens, from which it is
not less than forty-four miles in a direct line. From
its summit is a glorious prospect. Strabo thus describes
it:&mdash;"From the summit of the Acropolis,
Parnassus and Helicon are seen covered with snow.
Towards the west is the gulf of Krissa, bordered by
Phocis, B&#339;otia, Megaris, Corinthia, and Sicyonia.
Beyond are the Oneian mountains, extending to
B&#339;otia and Mount Cith&aelig;ron." The entire view
forms, on the whole, a panorama of the most captivating
features, and of the greatest dimensions,
comprehending six of the most celebrated states of
Greece;&mdash;Achaia, Locris, Phocis, B&#339;otia, Attica,
and Argolis<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>.</p>

<p>The Corinthian order having been invented at
Corinth, we cannot refuse ourselves the satisfaction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
of quoting a passage from Dr. Brewster's treatise on
Civil Architecture:&mdash;"The artists of Gr&aelig;cia Proper,
perceiving that in the Ionic order the severity of the
Doric had been departed from, by one happy effort
invented a third, which much surpassed the Ionic
in delicacy of proportion and richness of decorations.
This was named the Corinthian order.
The merit of this invention is ascribed to Callimachus
of Athens, who is said to have had the idea
suggested to him by observing acanthus leaves
growing round a basket, which had been placed
with some favourite trinkets upon the grave of a
young lady; the stalks which rose among the leaves
having been formed into slender volutes by a square
tile which covered the basket. It is possible that
a circumstance of this nature may have caught the
fancy of a sculptor who was contemporary with
Phidias; and who was, doubtless, in that age of competition,
alive to every thing which promised distinction
in his profession. But in the warmth of our
devotion for the inspiration of Greek genius, we
must not overlook the facts, that, in the pillars of
several temples in Upper Egypt, whose shafts represent
bundles of reeds or lotus, bound together in
several places by fillets, the capitals are formed by
several rows of delicate leaves. In the splendid
ruins of Vellore in Hindostan, the capitals are, also,
composed of similar ornaments; and it is well known,
that the Persians, at their great festivals, were in
the habit of decorating with flowers the tops of their
pillars which formed the public apartments. It is,
therefore, not improbable, that these circumstances,
after so much intercourse with other countries, might
have suggested ideas to Callimachus, which enabled
him to surpass the capital of Ionia<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>At Corinth, too, the art of portrait painting is said
to have been first practised.</p>

<p>The Parthian monarchs delighted in the pastoral
life of their Scythian ancestors; and the royal camp
was frequently pitched in the plain of Ctesiphon, on
the eastern bank of the Tigris, at the distance of
only three miles from Seleucia. It was, then, no
other than a village. By the influx of innumerable
attendants on luxury and despotism, who resorted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
to the court, this village insensibly swelled into a
large city; and there the Parthian kings, acting by
Seleucia as the Greeks, who built that place, had
done by Babylon, built a town, in order to dispeople
and impoverish Seleucia. Many of the materials,
however, were taken from Babylon itself; so that
from the time the anathema was pronounced against
that city, "it seems," says Rollin, "as if those
very persons, that ought to have protected her, were
become her enemies; as if they had all thought it
their duty to reduce her to a state of solitude, by
indirect means, though without using any violence;
that it might the more manifestly appear to be the
hand of God, rather than the hand of man, that
brought about her destruction."</p>

<p>This city was for some time assailed by Julian<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>,
who fixed his camp near the ruins of Seleucia, and
secured himself by a ditch and rampart, against the
sallies and enterprising garrison of Coche. In this
fruitful and pleasant country the Romans were supplied
with water and forage; and several forts,
which might have embarrassed the motions of the
army, submitted, after some resistance, to the efforts
of their valour. The fleet passed from the Euphrates
in an artificial diversion of the river, which forms
a copious and navigable stream into the Tigris,
at a small distance <i>below</i> the great city. Had they
followed this royal canal, which bore the name of
Nahar-Malcha<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>, the immediate situation of Coche
would have separated the fleet and army of Julian;
and the vast attempt of steering against the current<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
of the Tigris, and forcing their way through the midst
of a hostile capital, must have been attended with
the total destruction of the Roman army. As Julian
had minutely studied the operations of Trajan in the
same country, he soon recollected that his warlike
predecessor had dug a new and navigable canal,
which conveyed the waters into the Tigris, at some
distance above the river. From the information of
the peasants, Julian ascertained the vestiges of this
ancient work, which were almost obliterated by
design or accident. He, therefore, prepared a deep
channel for the reception of the Euphrates: the flood
of waters rushed into this new bed; and the Roman
fleet steered their triumphant course into the Tigris.
He soon after passed, with his whole army, over the
river: sending up a military shout, the Romans
advanced in measured steps, to the animating notes
of military music; launched their javelins, and
rushed forwards with drawn swords, to deprive the
barbarians, by a closer onset, of the advantage of
their missile weapons. The action lasted twelve
hours: the enemy at last gave way. They were
pursued to the gates of Ctesiphon, and the conquerors,
says the historian from whom we have
borrowed this account, might have entered the dismayed
city, had not their general desired them to
desist from the attempt; since, if it did not prove
successful, it must prove fatal. The spoil was ample:
large quantities of gold and silver, splendid arms and
trappings, and beds, and tables of massy silver. The
victor distributed, as the reward of valour, some
honourable gifts civic and mural, and naval crowns:
and then considered what new measures to pursue:
for, as we have already stated, his troops had not
ventured to attempt entering the city. He called
a council of war; but seeing that the town was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
strongly defended by the river, lofty walls<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>, and
impassable morasses, he came to the determination
of not besieging it; holding it a fruitless and pernicious
undertaking. This occurred <small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 363.</p>

<p>In this city Chosroes, king of Persia, built a
palace; supposed to have been once the most magnificent
structure in the East.</p>

<p>In process of time Seleucia and Ctesiphon became
united, and identified under the name of <i>Al Modain</i>,
or the two cities. This union is attributed to the
judgment of Adashir Babigan (the father of the
Sassanian line). It afterwards continued a favourite
capital with most of his dynasty, till the race perished
in the person of Yezdijerd; and Al Modain was
rendered a heap of ruins, by the fanatic Arabs, in
the beginning of the seventh century.</p>

<p>At that period (<small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 637), those walls, which had
resisted the battering rams of the Romans, yielded
to the darts of the Saracens. Said, the lieutenant of
Omar, passed the Tigris without opposition; the
capital was taken by assault; and the disorderly
resistance of the people gave a keener edge to the
sabre of the Moslems, who shouted in religious
transport, "This is the white palace of Chosroes:
this is the province of the apostle of God."</p>

<p>"The spoils," says Abulfeda, "surpassed the estimate
of fancy, or numbers;" and Elmacin defines
the untold and almost infinite mass by the fabulous
computation of three thousands of thousands of thousands
of pieces of gold<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the apartments of the palace was decorated
with a carpet of silk, 60 cubits in length, and as
many in breadth; a paradise, or garden, was depicted
on the ground; the flowers, fruits, and shrubs, were
imitated by the figures of the gold embroidery, and
the colours of the precious stones; and the ample
square was encircled by a verdant and variegated
border. The conqueror (Omar) divided the prize
among his brethren of Medina. The picture was
destroyed; but such was the value of the material,
that the share of Ali was sold for 20,000 drachms.
The sack was followed by the desertion and gradual
decay of the city. In little more than a century
after this it was finally supplanted by Bagdad under
the Caliph Almanzor.</p>

<p>"The imperial legions," says Porter, "of Rome and
Constantinople, with many a barbaric phalanx besides,
made successive dilapidation on the walls of Seleucia
and Ctesiphon; but it was reserved for Omar and
his military fanatics to complete the final overthrow.
That victorious caliph founded the city of Kufa on
the western shore of the Euphrates; whilst the defeat,
which the Persians sustained from one of his best
generals in the battle of Cadesia, led to the storming
of Al-Maidan, and an indiscriminate massacre of all
its Guebre inhabitants. In after times the caliph
Almanzor, taking a dislike to Kufa, removed the
seat of his government to Bagdad; the materials for
the erection of which he brought from the battered
walls of the Greek and Parthian city; so as Babylon
was ravaged and carried away for the building of
Seleucia and Ctesiphon, in the same manner did they
moulder into ruin before the rising foundations of
Bagdad." Little more remains of Seleucia but the
ground on which it stood; showing, by its unequal
surface, the low moundy traces of its former inhabitants.
Small as these vestiges may seem, they are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
daily wasting away, and soon nothing would be left
to mark the site of Seleucia, were it not for the apparently
imperishable canal of Nebuchadnezzar, the
Nahar Malcha, whose capacious bosom, noble in
ruins, open to the Tigris, north of where the city
stood."</p>

<p>What remains of the palace of Chosroes is thus
described by the same hand. "Having passed the
Diala, a river which flows into the Tigris, the lofty
palace of Chosroes, at Modain, upon the site of the
ancient Ctesiphon, became visible to us; looking
exceedingly large through the refracting atmosphere
of the southern horizon, above the even line of
which it towered as the most conspicuous object any
where to be seen around us. It looked from hence
much larger than Westminster Abbey, when seen
from a similar distance; and in its general outline it
resembled that building very much, excepting only in
its having no towers. The great cathedral of the
Crusaders, still standing on the ancient Orthosia, on
the coast of Syria, is a perfect model of it in general
appearance; as that building is seen when approaching
from the southward, although there is no one feature
of resemblance between those edifices in detail."</p>

<p>On the northern bank of the Diala, Mr. Buckingham
saw nothing but some grass huts, inhabited by a few
families, who earned their living by transporting
travellers across the river; and to the westward, near
the Tigris, a few scattered tents of Arab shepherds.
On the south bank a few date-trees were seen; but,
besides these, no other signs of fertility or cultivation
appeared.</p>

<p>When Mr. Buckingham reached the mounds of
Ctesiphon, he found them to be of a moderate height,
of a light colour, and strewed over with fragments of
those invariable remarks of former population, broken
pottery. The outer surface of the mounds made them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
appear as mere heaps of earth, long exposed to the
atmosphere; but he was assured by several well
acquainted with the true features of the place, that
on digging into the mounds, a masonry of unburnt
bricks was found, with layers of reed between them,
as in the ruins at Akkerhoof and the mounds of
Meklooba at Babylon. The extent of the semicircle
formed by these heaps, appears to be nearly two
miles. The area of the city, however, had but few
mounds throughout its whole extent, and those were
small and isolated; the space was chiefly covered
with thick heath, sending forth, as in the days of
Xenophon, a highly aromatic odour, which formed a
cover for partridges, hares, and gazelles, of each of
which the traveller saw considerable numbers.</p>

<p>After traversing a space within the walls, strewed
with fragments of burnt bricks and pottery, he came
to the tomb of Selman Pauk. "This Selman Pauk<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>,"
says Mr. Buckingham, "was a Persian barber, who,
from the fire-worship of his ancestors, became a
convert to Islam, under the persuasive eloquence of
the great prophet of Modain himself; and, after a
life of fidelity to the cause he had embraced, was
buried here in his native city of Modain. The
memory of this beloved companion of the great head
of their faith is held in great respect by all the
Mahometans of the country; for, besides the annual
feast of the barbers of Bagdad, who in the month of
April visit his tomb as that of a patron saint, there
are others who come to it on pilgrimage at all seasons
of the year."</p>

<p>The large ruin, which forms the principal attraction
of this place, is situated about seven hundred paces to
the south of this tomb. It is called by the natives
Tauk Kesra (the Arch of Kesra). It is composed of
two wings and one large central hall, extending all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
the depth of the building. Its front is nearly perfect;
being two hundred and sixty feet in length, and
upwards of one hundred feet in height. Of this front
the great arched hall occupies the centre; its entrance
being of an equal height and breadth with the hall
itself. The arch is thus about ninety feet in breadth,
and rising above the general line of the front, is at
least one hundred and twenty feet high, while its
depth is at least equal to its height. "The wings
leading out on each side of the central arch," continues
Mr. Buckingham, "to extend to the front of
the building, are now merely thick walls; but these
had originally apartments behind them, as may be
seen from undoubted marks that remain, as well as
two side doors leading from them into the great
central hall." The walls which form these wings in
the line of the front were built on the inclined slope,
being in thickness about twenty feet at the base; but
only ten at the summit. The masonry is altogether
of burnt bricks, of the size, form, and composition of
those seen in the ruins of Babylon; but none of them
have any writing or impression of any kind. The
cement is white lime, and the layers are much thicker
than is seen in any of the burnt brick edifices at
Babylon; approaching nearer to the style of the
Greek and Roman masonry found among the ruins
of Alexandria, where the layers of lime are almost as
thick as the bricks themselves. At Babylon the
cement is scarcely perceptible. The symmetry of the
work bears considerable resemblance, however, both
to the Birs and the fine fragments of brick-masonry of
the age of the Caliphs, still remaining at Bagdad.</p>

<p>The wings, though not perfectly uniform, are
similar in their general construction; "but the great
extent of the whole front," says our accomplished
traveller, "with the broad and lofty arch of its centre,
and the profusion of recesses and pilasters on each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
side, must have produced an imposing appearance,
when the edifice was perfect; more particularly if
the front was once coated, as tradition states it to have
been, with white marble; a material of too much
value to remain long in its place after the desertion
of the city." The arches of the building are described
to be all of a Roman form, and the architecture of the
Roman style, though with less purity of taste; the
pilasters having neither capital nor pedestal, and a
pyramidal termination is given to some of the long
narrow niches of the front.</p>

<p>There is a circumstance, in regard to the position
of this pile, very remarkable. The front of it, though
immediately facing the Tigris, lies due east by compass;
the stream winding here so exceedingly, that
this edifice, though standing on the <i>west</i> of that portion
of the river flowing before it, and facing the
<i>east</i>, is yet on the <i>eastern</i> side of the Tigris, in its
general course. Another curiosity of the same kind
is exhibited; that in regard to the sailing of boats,
the stream being so serpentine, that those which are
going <i>up</i> by it to Bagdad are seen steering south-south-west
through one reach, and north-west through
another above it. Nor ought we to close here. Sir
R. K. Porter furnishes a beautiful anecdote. "The
history of Persia, from the Royut-ul-Suffa," says he,
"gives an interesting anecdote of this palace. A
Roman ambassador, who had been sent to Chosroes
with rich presents, was admiring the noble prospect
from the window of the royal palace, when he remarked
a rough piece of ground; and making inquiry
why it was not rendered uniform with the rest, the
person to whom he spoke replied, 'It is the property
of an old woman, who, though often requested to sell
it to the king, has constantly refused; and our monarch
is more willing to have his prospect spoiled,
than to perfect it by an act of violence.' 'That rough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
spot,' cried the Roman, 'consecrated by justice, now
appears to me more beautiful than all the surrounding
scene'."<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>Casting the eye over the site of ancient Delphos<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>,
one cannot imagine what has become of the walls of
the numerous buildings, which are mentioned in the
history of its former magnificence. With the exception
of a few terraces, nothing now appears. We do
not even see any swellings or risings in the ground,
indicating the graves of the temple. All, therefore,
is mystery; and the Greeks may truly say,&mdash;"Where
stood the walls of our fathers? Scarce their mossy
tombs remain!" But</p>

<p class="poem">
Though here no more Apollo haunts his grot,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thou, the Muses' seat, art now their grave,</span><br />
Some gentle spirit still pervades the spot,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sighs in the gale, keeps silence in the cave,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And glides with glassy foot o'er yon melodious wave.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Delphos is now sunk into a village,&mdash;a village of
wretchedness,&mdash;known by the name of Castri.</p>

<p>Delphos was built in the form of a kind of amphitheatre,
and was divided into three parts; one rising,
as it were, above the other. It was universally believed
by the ancients to be situated in the middle
of the earth; in consequence of which it was called
the "navel of the world."</p>

<p>It stood under Parnassus. It was not defended
by walls, but by precipices, which environed it on
all sides. It had temples dedicated to Latona, Diana,
and Minerva Providence; also one dedicated to
Apollo. This edifice was built, for the most part, of
a very beautiful stone; but the frontispiece was of
Parian marble, and the vestibule was decorated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
with paintings. On the walls were moral sentences.
In the interior was a statue of the god, and such a
multitude of precious things, that it is impossible to
describe them. We must refer to Plutarch, Strabo,
Pausanias, and other ancient writers; and more particularly
to Barthelemy's "Travels of Anacharsis," since
he has collected all the principal circumstances in
regard to it. Our business is to state the condition
to which it is reduced. Before we do this, however,
we must admit something of what has been written
of this celebrated place.</p>

<p>Delphos was an ancient city of Phocis, in Achaia.
It stood upon the declivity, and about the middle of
the mountain Parnassus, built upon a small extent of
even ground, and surrounded by precipices, which
fortified it without the aid of art. Diodorus says,
that there was a cavity upon Parnassus, whence an
exhalation arose, which made the goats skip about,
and intoxicated the brain. A shepherd having approached
it, out of a desire to know the causes of so
extraordinary an effect, was immediately seized with
violent agitations of the body, and pronounced words
which indicated prophecy. Others made the same
experiment, and it was soon rumoured throughout
the neighbouring countries. The cavity was no
longer approached without reverence. The exhalation
was concluded to have something divine in it.
A priestess was appointed for the reception of its
inspirations, and a tripod was placed upon a vent, from
whence she gave oracles. The city of Delphos rose
insensibly round about the cave, where a temple was
erected, which at length became very magnificent.
The reputation of this oracle very much exceeded that
of all others.</p>

<p>The temple being burned about the fifty-eighth
Olympiad, the Amphyctions took upon themselves
the care of rebuilding it. They agreed with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
architect, for three hundred talents. The cities of
Greece were to furnish that sum. The Delphians
were taxed a fourth part of it, and made gatherings
in all parts, even in foreign nations, for that
purpose.</p>

<p>Gyges, king of Lydia, and Cr&#339;sus, one of his
successors, enriched the temple of Delphos with an
incredible number of presents. Many other princes,
cities, and private persons, by their example, in a
kind of emulation of each other, had heaped up in
it tripods, vessels, tables, shields, crowns, chariots,
and statues of gold and silver of all sizes, equally
infinite in number and value. The presents of gold
which Cr&#339;sus alone made to this temple amounted,
according to Herodotus, to upwards of 254 talents
(about 35,500<i>l.</i> sterling); and perhaps those of silver
to as much. Most of those presents were in being in
the time of Herodotus. Diodorus Siculus, adding
those of other princes to them, makes the amount
10,000 talents (about 1,300,000<i>l</i>).</p>

<p>It is not less surprising than true<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>, that one of the
most celebrated edifices in the world has been so
entirely destroyed, that sufficient traces are scarcely
left by which the traveller can form even a conjecture
as to its position.</p>

<p>During the Sacred war, the people of Phocis seized
from it 10,000 talents to maintain their armies
against their powerful opponents. Sylla plundered
it; and Nero carried away no less than five hundred
statues of brass, partly of the gods, and partly of
the most illustrious heroes. It had been plundered
no less than eleven times before.</p>

<p>It is not known when this celebrated oracle ceased.
Lucian says that answers were given in his time:
but most of the Grecian oracles were annihilated
when Constantine relinquished the errors of poly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>theism.
Indeed Constantine the Great proved a
more fatal enemy to Apollo and Delphos, than either
Sylla or Nero: he removed the sacred tripods to
adorn the hippodrome of his own city. Afterwards
Julian sent Oribesius to restore the temple, but he
was admonished by an oracle to represent to the
emperor the deplorable condition of the place. "Tell
him, the well-built court is fallen to the ground.
Ph&#339;bus has not a cottage; nor the prophetic laurel;
nor the speaking fountain (Cassotis); but even the
beautiful water is extinct."</p>

<p>The temple was situated in a very romantic situation;
rendered still more striking by the innumerable
echoes, which multiplied every sound, and increased
the veneration of superstitious visitants. But even
its form is unknown; though painters, for the most
part, have delineated it as circular, amongst whom may
be mentioned Claude Lorrain, and Gaspar Poussin.</p>

<p>The Apollo Belvidere is supposed to be a copy
from the statue in this temple.</p>

<p>The Castalian spring, however, still exists, and
equally clear as in ancient times. It is ornamented
with ivy, and overshadowed by a large fig-tree, the
roots of which have penetrated the fissures of the
rock. At the front is a majestic plane-tree.</p>

<p>The remains of the town wall are a little to the
east of the Castalian spring; but no part of it is left
but the interior mass, which consists of an exceedingly
hard composition of small stones and mortar.</p>

<p>When Pausanias visited Delphos, there were four
temples and a gymnasium in the vicinity of the
eastern gate; and several ruins and fragments may
now be seen: some fine blocks of marble, some with
inscriptions, a marble triglyph, and other Doric remains.
There are none, however, of the hippodrome;
in which ten chariots are said to have been able to
start at the same moment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>The temple has vanished like a dream, leaving not a
trace behind; insomuch, that Mr. Dodwell's opinion is,
that the site of this far-famed edifice must be sought
for under the humble cottages of Castri, as the whole
village probably stands within its ancient peribolos.
In some places, however, are blocks of considerable
magnitude; and some ancient foundations, supposed
to be those of the Lesche, which contained the paintings
of Polygnotus; and near the Aga's house are
several remains of some fluted marble columns, of the
Doric order, and of large dimensions. Some inscriptions,
too, have been observed. One in marble is in
honour of the Emperor Hadrian: "<i>The council of the
Amphictyons, under the superintendence of the priest
Plutarch, from Delphi, commemorate the Emperor</i>."
Another: "<i>The council of Amphictyons and Achaians,
in honour of Polycratea, high priestess of the
Achaian Council, and daughter of Polycrates and
Diogeneia</i>." Another states that "<i>The father and
mother of Amarius Nepos, honoured by the Senate
of Corinth with rewards, due to him as senator and
overseer of the Forum, put their son under the protection
of the Pythian Apollo</i>."</p>

<p>The remains of the gymnasium are principally behind
the monastery. The foundations were sustained
by an immense bulwark of hewn stone. There is
also some part of a stadium. The marble posts
remain. Its length is 660 feet. "I was surprised,"
says Mr. Dodwell, "to find few fragments of marble
among the ruins of Delphos. The town was small;
but it was a concentration of great opulence and
splendour. What can have become of the materials
which adorned its public edifices? Several curiosities
are no doubt buried below the village: though the
soil is in general so thin and so rocky, that great
masses cannot be concealed beneath the superficies."
They have, no doubt, crumbled away. The fate,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
however, of Delphos has been greatly aggravated of
late years; for in consequence of some dispute between
the agents of Ali Pacha and the inhabitants of
Castri, the Pacha laid the village under contribution
to pay him the sum of 15,000 piastres. This they
were unable to do; in consequence of which everything
was taken from them; and this serves to explain
the ruined state of the place. "In its present condition,"
says Dr. Clarke, "there is not in all Lapland a
more wretched village than Castri<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>."</p>

<h2><a name="NO_XXXII_ECBATANA" id="NO_XXXII_ECBATANA"></a>NO. XXXII.&mdash;ECBATANA.</h2>


<p>This city, which Heraclius says was as large as
Athens, was founded by one of the most illustrious
princes that ever adorned the earth&mdash;Dejoces, King of
the Medes. Not that we mean to vindicate or approve
all that he did; but, "taking him for all in all," history
has but few characters that can be placed in competition
with him.</p>

<p>It is not our intention to write the history of this
celebrated prince anew, his story being almost unanimously
allowed: we have only to copy. We shall,
therefore, select the account, compiled by Rollin, from
the testimony of Herodotus; ours being an abstract.</p>

<p>The Medes were a people divided into tribes. They
dwelt almost entirely in villages; but Dejoces, finding
with how great an inconvenience such a mode of
life was attended, erected the state into a monarchy.
The methods he took to accomplish this, exhibited
the consummate wisdom with which his mind was
endowed. When he formed the design, he laboured
to make the good qualities that had been observed in
him more conspicuous than ever; and he succeeded
so well, that the inhabitants of the district in which
he lived, made him their judge. His conduct fully
answered the expectation of those who elected him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
He brought the association into a regular mode
of life; and this being observed by a multitude of
other villages, they soon began to make him arbitrator
for them, as he had been for the first. "When
he found himself thus advanced," says the historian,
"he judged it a proper time to set his last engines
to work for compassing his point. He, therefore,
retired from business, pretending to be over-fatigued
with the multitude of people that resorted to him
from all quarters; and would not exercise the office of
judge any longer, notwithstanding all the importunity
of such as wished well to the public tranquillity.
When any person addressed themselves to him, he
told them, that his own domestic affairs would not
allow him to attend to those of other people."</p>

<p>The consequence of this withdrawal was, that the
various communities relapsed into a worse state than
they had been before; and the evil increased so rapidly,
from day to day, that the Medes felt themselves
constrained to meet, in order to endeavour to
find some remedy for it. This was what Dejoces
had foreseen. He sent emissaries, therefore, to the
assembly, with instructions in what manner to act.
When the turn came for those persons to speak, they
declared their opinion, that unless the face of the
republic was entirely changed, the whole country
would be entirely uninhabitable. "The only means,"
said they, "left for us is, to elect a king. Having
elected a sovereign, with authority to restrain violence,
and make laws, every one can prosecute his
own affairs in peace and security." This opinion was
seconded by the consent of the whole assembly. All
that remained then was to find out a proper person.
This did not require much time. Dejoces was the
man to whom all eyes were instantly turned. He
was, therefore, immediately elected king with the
consent of all present. "There is," says the author<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
from whom we borrow, "nothing nobler or greater,
than to see a private person, eminent for his merit
and virtue, and fitted by his excellent talents for the
highest employments, and yet, through inclination
and modesty, preferring a life of obscurity and retirement;
thus to see such a man sincerely refuse the
offer made to him of reigning over a whole nation,
and at last consent to undergo the toil of government
upon no other motive than that of being useful to his
fellow citizens. Such a governor was Numa at Rome,
and such have been some other governors, whom the
people have constrained to accept the supreme power.
But," continues he in a strain of great wisdom,
"to put on the mask of modesty and virtue, in order
to satisfy one's ambition, as Dejoces did; to affect
to appear outwardly what a man is not inwardly; to
refuse for a time, and then accept with a seeming
repugnancy what a man earnestly desires, and what
he has been labouring by secret, underhand, practices
to obtain; this double dealing has so much
meanness in it, that it goes a great way to lessen our
opinion of the person, be his talents never so great or
extraordinary."</p>

<p>The method by which Dejoces gained his ambition
to be king, greatly disenchants us of his merits.
But having attained it, he acted in a manner few
men have been found to adopt, even when they have
arrived at the throne by the most legitimate of methods.
He set himself to civilise and polish his
subjects; men who, having lived perpetually in villages,
almost without laws and without polity, had
contracted rude manners and savage dispositions.</p>

<p>Thus animated, he selected a hill, the ascent of
which was regular on every side, and having marked
out, with his own hands, the circumference of the
walls, he laid the foundation of a city, which became
the capital of the dominions of which he had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
elected sovereign. When he had done this, he constructed
walls after the following manner. Their
number was seven; all disposed in such a manner,
that the outermost did not hinder the parapet of the
second from being seen; nor the second that of the
third, and so of all the rest. Within the last and
smallest inclosure he erected his own palace; and
there he kept all his treasures. The first and largest
inclosure is supposed to have been of about the size
of Athens, when at its greatest height. The palace
was at the foot of the citadel, and about seven furlongs
in circumference. The wood-work was of cedar
or cypress; the beams, the ceilings, the columns of
the porticoes, and the peristyles, were plated with
either gold or silver; the roofs were covered with
silver tiles.</p>

<p>This city the founder called <span class="smcap">Ecbatana</span><a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>. The aspect
of it was beautiful and magnificent; and, having
completed it to his satisfaction, he employed himself
in composing laws for the good of the community.
In order to do this with greater effect, and with a
view to keep up the respect which nearness of view
is apt to impair with rude and ignorant persons, he
secluded himself almost entirely from the people at
large. All was done through the medium of agents<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
and servants. He knew all that was passing. He
made a multitude of wise laws. He became literally
the true father of his people; for so entirely did he
give himself up to the contemplation of their benefit,
that though he reigned not less than fifty-three years,
he had no reason to complain of any of the neighbouring
kingdoms; and so satisfied was he of the
good belonging to his own fortune, that he never
once engaged in any enterprise against them.</p>

<p>Dejoces was succeeded by his son Phraortes, of
whom it is not necessary to say more than that he
enlarged the city his father had built. He was succeeded
by Cyaxares I., who reigned forty years.
He made himself master of all the cities of the kingdom
of Assyria, except Babylon and Chald&aelig;a.
Astyages was the next king of the Medes, he who
is called in scripture Ahasuerus.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> He married his
daughter, Mandana, to Cambyses king of Persia;
and thereby became grandfather to the great Cyrus,
one of the most remarkable princes in all history.
He was succeeded by Cyaxares II., called in scripture
Darius the Mede; who, under the generalship
of Cyrus, having taken Babylon, Cyrus, on the
death of his father Cambyses, and his uncle, whom
he had made governor of Babylon, united the empires
of the Medes and Persians under one and the same
authority. Ecbatana, therefore, from that time ceased
to be the chief seat of authority<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>Diodorus Siculus relates, that when Semiramis
came to Ecbatana, "which," says he, "is situated
in a low and even plain," she built a stately palace
there, and bestowed more care upon that city than
she had done upon any other. For the city wanting
water (there being no spring near it), she plentifully
supplied it with such as was good, which she brought
thither in this manner. There is a mountain called
Orontes, twelve furlongs distant from the city, exceedingly
high and steep for the space of twenty-five
furlongs up to the top. On the other side of this
mount there is a large mere, or lake, which empties
itself into the river. At the foot of this mount she
dug a canal fifteen feet in breadth and forty in depth,
through which she conveyed water to the city in
great abundance<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>.</p>

<p>Alexander being in pursuit of Darius, came within
three days' march of Ecbatana, where he was met
by the son of Ochus, who informed him that Darius
had left that city five days before, carrying with
him five thousand talents (about one million five
hundred thousand pounds), from the Median treasury.
When Alexander took possession of the city,
he laid up all the treasure he had got from Persis
and Susiana. It was in this city that Darius made
the following remarkable speech to the principal
officers of his army. He had lost Persepolis and
Pasagarda:&mdash;"Dear companions, among so many
thousand men who composed my army, you only
have not abandoned me during the whole course of
my ill-fortune; and, in a short time, nought but your
fidelity and constancy will be able to make me fancy
myself a king. Deserters and traitors now govern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
in my cities. Not that they are thought worthy of
the honour bestowed upon them; but rewards are
given them only in the view of tempting you, and
staggering your perseverance. You still chose to follow
my fortune rather than that of the conqueror; for
which you certainly have merited a recompense from
the gods; and I do not doubt but they will prove
beneficent towards you, in case that power is denied
me. With such soldiers and officers I would brave,
without the least dread, the enemy, how formidable
soever he may be. What! would any one have me
surrender myself up to the mercy of the conqueror,
and expect from him, as a reward of my baseness and
meanness of spirit, the government of some province
which he may condescend to leave? No! It never
shall be in the power of any man, either to take
away, or fix upon my head, the diadem I wear.
The same power shall put a period to my reign and
life. If you have all the same courage and resolution,
which I can no longer doubt, I assure
myself that you shall retain your liberty, and not be
exposed to the pride and insults of the Macedonians.
You have in your own hands the means either to
revenge or terminate all your evils." Having ended
this speech, the whole body replied with shouts, that
they were ready to follow him in all fortunes.</p>

<p>Nabarzanes and Bessus soon showed the unfortunate
king how little confidence is to be placed in
man. They and other traitors seized upon Darius,
bound him in chains of gold, placed him in a covered
chariot, and set out for Bactriana, with the design
of delivering their master up to Alexander. They
afterwards murdered him.</p>

<p>Plutarch says of Alexander, that he traversed all
the province of Babylon, which immediately made
its submission; and that in the district of Ecbatana,
he saw a gulf of fire, which streamed continually,
as from an inexhaustible source. He admired, also,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
a flood of naphtha, not far from the gulf, which
flowed in such abundance that it formed a lake. The
naphtha, in many respects, resembles the bitumen,
but is much more inflammable. Before any fire touches
it, it catches light from a flame at some distance, and
often kindles all the immediate air. The barbarians,
to show the king its force, and the subtlety of its
nature, scattered some drops of it in the street,
which led to his lodging; and standing at one end,
they applied their torches to some of the first drops;
for it was night. The flame communicated itself
swifter than thought, and the street was instantaneously
all on fire.</p>

<p>On his arrival, Alexander offered magnificent
sacrifices to the deities, in thanksgiving for the success
that had crowned his arms. Gymnic games and
theatrical representations succeeded, and universal festivities
reigned in the Grecian army. But in the midst
of these rejoicings, the king had the misfortune to
lose the friend he loved the most. He was engaged
in presiding at the games, when he was suddenly
and hastily sent for; but before he could reach the
bed-side of Heph&aelig;stion, his friend had expired.</p>

<p>The king gave himself up to sorrow many days.
At length, when he had recovered his self-command,
he gave orders for a magnificent funeral, the expense
of which is said to have amounted to not less
than 10,000 talents, that is, about two millions!
All the Oriental subjects were charged to put on
mourning; and it is even affirmed, that, to gratify
Alexander's affection, several of his companions
dedicated themselves and arms to the deceased favourite.
The folly of Alexander went even farther.
He wrote to Cleomenes, his governor in Egypt, a
person of an inordinate bad character, commanding
him to erect two temples to Heph&aelig;stion; one at
Alexandria, and another in the island of Pharos:
"If I find these temples erected, when I return into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Egypt, I will not only forgive all thy past deeds,
but likewise all thou mayest hereafter commit!"</p>

<p>Plutarch says:&mdash;When he came to Ecbatana, in
Media, and had despatched the most urgent affairs,
he employed himself in the celebration of games,
and other public solemnities; for which purpose
3000 artificers, lately arrived from Greece, were very
serviceable to him. But, unfortunately, Heph&aelig;stion
fell sick of a fever in the midst of this festivity.
As a young man and a soldier, he could not bear to
be kept to strict diet; and taking the opportunity
to dine when his physician Glaucus was gone to the
theatre, he ate a roasted fowl, and drank a flagon
of wine, made as cold as possible; in consequence of
which he grew worse, and died a few days after.</p>

<p>Plutarch and Quintus Curtius relate, that when
Darius offered Alexander all the country which lies
on the west of the Euphrates, with his daughter
Statira in marriage, and a portion of 10,000 talents
of gold, Parmenio having been present at this offer,
and having been required to state his opinion in
regard to it, answered, that if it were he, he
would accept it; "so would I," answered Alexander,
"were I Parmenio."</p>

<p>Sometime after this, the life of this excellent
friend and consummate general, as well as that of
his son, was sacrificed to a mean and wanton accusation
made against him of treason against his
master's person; dying in the height of his prosperity,
in the 70th year of his age. At Ecbatana,
it was commonly observed in the army to which he
belonged, that Parmenio had gained many victories
without Alexander, but that Alexander had gained
none without Parmenio.</p>

<p>Ecbatana is supposed to have been situated where
the modern Hameden now stands; that is, in the
province of Irac-Agemi, winding between Bagdad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
and Ispahan, 240 miles from each. It stands at
the foot of a mountain, whence issue streams, that
water the country. The adjacent parts are fertile,
and productive of corn and rice. The air is healthy,
but the winter is said to be intense. Its climate,
however, was so fine in ancient times, that the Persian
kings preferred it to Ispahan or Susa; hence It
acquired the title of the "Royal City."</p>

<p>"Ecbatana," says Rennell, "was unquestionably on,
or near, the site of Hameden in Al Jebel. A great
number of authorities concur in proving this; although
many refer to Tauris, or Tebriz, in Aderbigian; Mr.
Gibbon and Sir William Jones among the rest. The
authorities are too numerous to be adduced here.
We shall only mention that Isidore of Charax places
it on the road from Seleucia to Parthia; that Pliny
says Susa is equi-distant from Seleucia and Ecbatana;
and that Ecbatana itself lies in the road from
Nineveh to Rages or Ray." "The situation of Hameden,"
says Mr. Morier, "so much unlike that of other
Persian cities, would of itself be sufficient to establish
its claim to a remote origin, considering the propensity
of the ancients to build their cities on elevated
positions. Ispahan, Schiraz, Teheran, Tabris, Khoi,
&amp;c., are all built on plains; but Hameden occupies
a great diversity of surface, and, like Rome and Constantinople,
can enumerate the hills over which it is
spread. Its locality, too, agrees with that of Ecbatana,
built on the declivity of the Orontes, according
to Polybius<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>, and is also conformable to Herodotus<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>;
who, in describing the walls, rising into circles one
above another, says, 'this mode of building was
favoured by the situation of the place.'"</p>

<p>"I had not expected to see Ecbatana," says Sir
Robert Ker Porter, "as Alexander found it; neither in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
the superb ruin, in which Timour had left it; but,
almost unconsciously to myself, some indistinct ideas
of what it had been floated before me; and when I
actually beheld its remains, it was with the appalled
shock of seeing a prostrate dead body, where I had
anticipated a living man, though drooping to decay.
Orontes, indeed, was there, magnificent and hoary-headed;
the funeral remnant of the poor corpse
beneath." The extensive plain of Hameden stretched
below, and the scene there was delightful. Numberless
castellated villages, rising amidst groves of the
noblest trees. The whole tract appeared as a carpet
of luxuriant verdure, studded by hamlets and watered
by rivulets. "If the aspect of this part of the country,"
thought the traveller, "now presents so rich a
picture, when its palaces are no more, what must it
have been when Astyages held his court here; and
Cyrus, in his yearly courses from Persepolis, Susa,
and Babylon, stretched his golden sceptre over this
delicious plain? Well might such a garden of nature's
bounties be the favourite seat of kings, the
nursery of the arts, and all the graceful courtesies of
life."</p>

<p>The site of the modern town, Sir Robert goes on
to observe, like that of the ancient, is on a gradual
ascent, terminating near the foot of the eastern side
of the mountain. It bears many vestiges of having
been strongly fortified. The sides and summits are
covered with large remnants of great thickness, and
also of towers, the materials of which were bricks,
dried in the sun.</p>

<p>When it lost the name of Ecbatana in that of
Hameden, it seems to have lost its honours too; for
while it preserved the old appellation of the capital,
whence the great kings of the Kaianian race had
dictated their decrees; and where "Cyrus, the king,
had placed, in the house of the rolls of its palace, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
record wherein was written his order for the rebuilding
of Jerusalem," it seems, with the retention
of its name, to have preserved some memory of its
consequence, even so far into modern times as three
centuries of "the Christian era." "It was then,"
continues our accomplished traveller, "that Tiridates
attempted to transfer its glories to his own capital;
and, according to Ebn Haukel, the gradual progress
of six hundred years mouldered away the architectural
superiority of the ancient city. Towards the
end of the fourteenth century, Tamerlane sacked,
pillaged, and destroyed its proudest buildings, ruined
the inhabitants, and reduced the whole, from being
one of the most extensive cities of the East, to hardly
a parsang in length and breadth<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>. In that dismantled
and dismembered state, though dwindled to a mere
day-built suburb of what it was, it possessed iron
gates, till within these fifty years; when Aga Mahomed
Khan, not satisfied with the depth of so great
a capital's degradation, ordered every remain of past
consequence to be destroyed." The result? "His
commands were obeyed to a tittle. The mud alleys,
which now occupy the site of ancient streets or
squares, are narrow, interrupted by large holes or
hollows, in the way, and heaps of the fallen crumbled
walls of deserted dwellings. A miserable bazaar or
two are passed through in traversing the town; and
large lonely spots are met with, marked by broken
low mounds over older ruins; with here and there a
few poplars or willow trees, shadowing the border<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
of a dirty stream, abandoned to the meanest uses;
which, probably, flowed pellucid and admired, when
these places were gardens, and the grass-grown heap
some stately dwelling of Ecbatana."</p>

<p>In one or two spots may be observed square platforms
of large stones, many of which are chiselled
over with the finest Arabic characters. These, however,
are evidently tomb-stones of the inhabitants
during the caliphs' rule; the register of yesterday.
"As I passed through the wretched hovelled streets,
and saw the once lofty city of Astyages, shrunk
like a shrivelled gourd, the contemplation of such a
spectacle called forth more saddening reflections than
any that had awakened in me on any former ground
of departed greatness. In some I had seen mouldering
pomp, or sublime desolation; in this, every object
spoke of neglect, and hopeless poverty. Not majesty
in stately ruin, pining to find dissolution on the spot
where it was first blasted; but beggary, seated on
the place which kings had occupied, squalid with
rags, and stupid with misery. It was impossible to
look on it and not exclaim, "O Ecbatana, seat of
princes! How is the mighty fallen, and the weapons
of war perished!"</p>

<p>Sir Robert saw, not far from the remains of a fortress
to the south, the broken base and shaft of a
column; which, on examination, proved to him that
the architecture of Persepolis and Ecbatana had been
the same.</p>

<p>Hameden is to be seen for several miles before
reaching Surkhahed, for several stages. Mr. Morier
saw nothing in Persia that wore such an appearance
of prosperity; for the plain, about nine miles
in breadth and fifteen in length, was one continued
series of fields and orchards. Hameden itself is
one of the best watered places in Persia. All the
habitations are interspersed with trees. The most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
conspicuous building is a large mosque, called
Mesjed Jumah, now falling into decay; and there
was to be seen, every morning, before the sun rises,
a numerous body of peasants, with spades in their
hands, waiting to be hired for the day, to work in
the surrounding fields.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Near the Mosque, in a
court, filled with tents, stands a building, called
the sepulchre of Esther and Mordecai. It is of an
architecture of the earliest ages of Mohammedism.
It was erected in the year of the Creation 4474, by
two devout Jews of Kasham.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><i>Translation of the inscription on the marble slab in
the sepulchre of Esther and Mordecai.</i></p>

<p>"Mordecai, beloved and honoured by a king, was
great and good. His garments were those of a
sovereign. Ahasuerus covered him with this rich
dress, and also placed a golden chain around his
neck. The city of Susa rejoiced at his honours, and
his high fortune became the glory of the Jews."</p></div>

<p>On a steep declivity of the Orontes are to be seen
two tablets, each of which is divided into three
longitudinal compartments, inscribed by the arrow-headed
character of Persepolis. In the northern
skirts of the city, Mr. Morier found another monument
of antiquity. This is the base of the column,
which we noticed just now; and this, Mr. Morier
is equally certain with Sir Robert, is of the identical
order of the columns of Persepolis, and of the same
sort of stone. This, says Mr. Morier, led to a dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>covery
of some importance; for, adjacent to this
fragment is a large but irregular terrace, evidently
the work of art, and perhaps the ground-plan of
some great building; of the remains of which its
soil must be the repository. Mr. Morier is induced
to believe, that the situation of this spot agrees with
that Polybius<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> would assign to the palace of the
kings of Persia, which, he says, was below the
citadel.</p>

<p>Besides these, there are many other antiquities;
but as they all belong to Mohammedan times, they
do not come within the sphere of our subject. There
are some hopes that this city may, one day, assume
a far different rank than what it now holds;<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
for, within a few years, it has been created a royal
government, and committed to the care of Mohammed
Ali Mirza. Palaces, therefore, have been erected,
and mansions for his ministers, new bazaars and
mercantile caravanserais.</p>

<p>We shall close this account with Sir Robert's description
of the view that is to be seen from Mount
Orontes, now called Mount Elwund. "It is one of the
most stupendous scenes I had ever seen! I stood on the
eastern park. The apparently intermediate peaks of
the Courdistan mountains spread before me far to the
north-west; while continued chains of the less towering
heights of Louristan stretched south-east; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
linking themselves with the more lofty piles of the
Bactiari, my eye followed their receding summits, till
lost in the hot and tremulous haze of an Asiatic sky.
The general hue of this endless mountain region was
murky red; to which in many parts the arid glare
of the atmosphere gave so preternatural a brightness,
that it might well have been called a land of fire.
From the point on which I stood, I beheld the whole
mass of country round the unbroken concave:&mdash;it
was of enormous expanse; and although, from the
clearness of the air, and the cloudless state of the heavens,
no object was clouded from my sight; yet, from
the immensity of the height whence I viewed the
scene, the luxuriancy of the valleys was entirely lost in
the shadows of the hills; and nothing was left to the
beholder from the top of Elwund, but the bare and
burning summits of countless mountains. Not a drop
of water was discernible of all the many streams,
which poured from the bosom into the plains below.
In my life I had never beheld so tremendous a spectacle.
It appeared like standing upon the stony crust
of some rocky world, which had yet to be broken up
by the Almighty word, and unfold to the beneficent
mandate the fructifying principles of earth and water,
bursting into vegetation and terrestrial life<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="NO_XXXIII_ELEUSIS" id="NO_XXXIII_ELEUSIS"></a>NO. XXXIII.&mdash;ELEUSIS.</h2>


<p>This was a town of Attica, equally distant from
Megara and the Pir&aelig;us; greatly celebrated for the
observance, every fifth year, of the greatest festival in
Greece, called the Eleusinian; a festival sacred to
Ceres and Proserpine; every thing appertaining to
which was a secret, or mystery; to divulge any of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
which was supposed to call down an immediate judgment
from heaven.</p>

<p>"Ceres," says an Athenian orator, "wandering in
quest of her daughter Proserpine, came into Attica,
where some good offices were done her, which it is
unlawful for those who are not initiated to hear. In
return, she conferred two unparalleled benefits:&mdash;the
knowledge of agriculture, by which the human race
is raised above the brute creation; and the mysteries,
from which the partakers derive sweeter hopes than
other men enjoy, both in the present life and to
eternity."</p>

<p>There is nothing in all the Pagan antiquity more
celebrated than the mysteries and feasts of Ceres
Eleusina<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>. Their origin and institution are attributed
to Ceres herself, who in the reign of Erechtheus,
coming to Eleusis, a small town of Attica, in search
of her daughter Proserpine, whom Pluto had carried
away, and finding the country afflicted with a famine,
she not only taught them the use of corn, but instructed
them in the principles of probity, charity,
civility, and humanity. These mysteries were divided
into the less and the greater, of which the former served
as a preparation for the latter. Only Athenians were
admitted to them; but of them each sex, age, and
condition had a right to be received. All strangers
were absolutely excluded. We shall consider principally
the greater mysteries, which were celebrated
at Eleusis.</p>

<p>Those who demanded to be initiated into them,
were obliged, before their reception, to purify themselves
in the lesser mysteries, by bathing in the
river Ilissus, by saying certain prayers, offering sacrifices,
and, above all, by living in strict continence
during an interval of time prescribed them. That
time was employed in instructing them in the prin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>ciples
and elements of the sacred doctrine of the great
mysteries.</p>

<p>When the time for their initiation arrived, they
were brought into the temple; and to inspire the
greater reverence and terror, the ceremony was performed
in the night. Wonderful things passed upon
this occasion. Visions were seen, and voices heard,
of an extraordinary kind. A sudden splendour dispelled
the darkness of the place; and disappearing
immediately, added new horrors to the gloom. Apparitions,
claps of thunder, earthquakes, improved the
terror and amazement; whilst the person admitted,
stupified, sweating through fear, heard trembling the
mysterious volumes read to him. These nocturnal rites
were attended with many disorders, which the severe
law of silence, imposed on the persons initiated, prevented
from coming to light. The president in this
ceremony was called a Hierophant. He wore a peculiar
habit, and was not admitted to marry. He had
three colleagues; one who carried a torch; another,
a herald, whose office was to pronounce certain
mysterious words; and a third, to attend at the
altar.</p>

<p>Besides these officers, one of the principal magistrates
of the city was appointed to take care that all
the ceremonies of this feast were exactly observed.
He was called the king, and was one of the nine
Archons. His business was to offer prayers and
sacrifices. The people gave him four assistants. He
had, besides, ten other ministers to assist him in the
discharge of his duty, and particularly in offering
sacrifices.</p>

<p>The Athenians initiated their children of both sexes
very early into these mysteries, and would have
thought it criminal to have let them die without such
an advantage.</p>

<p>It was regularly celebrated every fifth year; that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
is, after a revolution of four years: and history
records, that it was never interrupted, except upon
the taking of Thebes by Alexander the Great. It
was continued down to the time of the Christian
emperors; and Valentinian would have abolished it,
if Pr&aelig;textatus, the proconsul of Greece, had not represented
in the most lively and affecting terms the
universal sorrow which the abrogation of that feast
would occasion among the people; upon which it was
suffered to subsist. It is supposed to have been
finally suppressed by Theodosius the Great.</p>

<p>At this place there were several sacred monuments,
such as chapels and altars; and many rich citizens of
Athens had pleasant and beautiful villas there<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>. The
great temple at Eleusis was plundered by the Spartan
king Cleomenes, and it was burnt by the Persians,
in their flight after the battle of Plat&aelig;a. It was
afterwards rebuilt by Iktinos; but nearly entirely
destroyed by Alaric. After this Eleusis became an
inconsiderable village. It is now inhabited by a few
poor Albanian Christians. The temple of Ceres and
Proserpine was built under the administration of
Pericles. It was of the marble of Pentelicus. It
was equally vast and magnificent. Its length, from
north to south, was about three hundred and eighty-six
feet, and its breadth about three hundred and
twenty-seven; and the most celebrated artists were
employed in its construction and decoration.</p>

<p>"In the most flourishing times of Athens," says
Wheler, "Eleusis was one of their principal towns, but
is now crushed down under their hard fortune, having
been so ill treated by the Christian pirates, more
inhuman than the very Turks, that all its inhabitants
have left it; there being now nothing remaining but
ruins. The place is situated upon a long hill, stretched
out near to the sea, north-east and north-west, not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
far distant from the mountain Gerata. The whole
hill seems to have been built upon, but chiefly
towards the sea, where the first thing we came to
was the stately temple of Ceres, now prostrate upon
the ground; I cannot say, 'not having one stone
upon another,' for it lieth all in a confused heap
together, the beautiful pillars buried in the rubbish
of its dejected roof and walls, and its goodly carved
and polished cornices used with no more respect than
the worst stone of the pavement. It lies in such a
rude and disorderly manner, that it is not possible to
judge of its ancient form; only it appeared to have
been built of most beautiful white marble, and no
less admirable stone."</p>

<p>There are also remains of several old sepulchres;
and among these was lately found an inscription
relative to something dedicated to Ceres and her
daughter, by Fabius, the Dadouchos. Another is
in the wall of a cottage, and is relative to a member
of the Areopagus, who erected a statue to his wife.</p>

<p>The temple of Neptune is supposed to have been
near the sea, where traces now remain, composed of
dark Eleusinian marble. The foundations of the
ancient tombs are still visible; but there are no
remains of the city walls; but a long wall, which
united it with the port, may be still traced with little
interruption.</p>

<p>The temple of Venus, which was of the Doric
order, is now a mass of rubbish, among which have
been found several marble doves of the natural size.</p>

<p>Many fragments, says Mr. Dodwell, have probably
been removed, owing to its propinquity to the sea,
and the consequent facility of exportation. The
church of St. Zacharias is almost entirely composed
of ancient fragments. This is probably the situation
of the temple of Diana; and of a large ancient well
he supposes to be that mentioned by Pausanias,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
round which the women of Eleusis danced in
honour of the goddess.</p>

<p>There were also temples dedicated to Triptolemus
and Neptune, the father; but of these not a fragment
remains<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="NO_XXXIV_ELIS" id="NO_XXXIV_ELIS"></a>NO. XXXIV.&mdash;ELIS.</h2>


<p>Elis was formed, like many of the Grecian cities,
more especially in the Peloponnesus, by the union of
several hamlets.</p>

<p>It was a large and populous city in the time of
Demosthenes; but in that of Homer it did not
exist.</p>

<p>Elis was originally governed by kings, and received
its name from Eleus, one of its monarchs.
It was famous for the horses it produced, whose celebrity
was so often tried at the Olympic games.</p>

<p>"On our arrival at Elis," says Anacharsis, "we
met a procession on its way to the temple of Minerva,
and that made part of a ceremony, in which the
youth of Elis contended for the prize of beauty. The
victor was led in triumph; the first, with his head
bound with ribands, bore the weapons to be consecrated
to the goddess; the second conducted the
victim; and the third carried the other offerings.
I have often seen similar contests in Greece, for the
young men; as well as for the women and girls.
Even among distant nations, I have seen women admitted
to public competitions; with this difference,
however, that the Greeks decree the prize to the
most beautiful, and the barbarians to the most
virtuous."</p>

<p>This city was once ornamented with temples,
sumptuous edifices, and a number of statues. Among
these was particularly distinguished the group of
the Graces, in a temple dedicated to them. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
were habited in a light and brilliant drapery;&mdash;the
first held a myrtle branch in honour of Venus; the
second, a rose, to denote the spring; the third, a die,
the symbol of infant sports.</p>

<p>The chief curiosity at Elis, however, was a statue
of Jupiter, formed by Phidias<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>. The serene majesty
and beauty of this piece of sculpture ranked it
among the wonders of the world. Jupiter was represented
sitting upon a throne, with an olive wreath
of gold about his temples; the upper part of his
body was naked; a wide mantle, covering the rest of
it, hung down in the richest folds to his feet, which
rested on a footstool. The naked parts of the statue
were of ivory; the dress was of beaten gold, with an
imitation of embroidery, painted by Pan&aelig;nus, brother
of Phidias. In the right hand stood the goddess
Victoria, turning towards the statue, and carved, like
it, out of ivory and gold; she was holding out a
band, with which she appeared desirous to encircle
his olive crown. In his left hand the divinity held
a parti-coloured sceptre, made of various metals skilfully
joined, and on the sceptre rested an eagle.
Power, wisdom, and goodness, were admirably expressed
in his features. He sat with the air of a
divinity, presiding among the judges of the games,
and dispensing the laurel wreaths to the victors, calm
in conscious dignity. The statue was surrounded
with magnificent drapery, which was drawn aside
only on particular occasions, when the deity was to
be exhibited. A sense of greatness and splendour
overwhelmed the spectator, the height of the figure
being about forty feet.</p>

<p>The structures of Elis<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> seem to have been raised
with materials far less elegant and durable than the
produce of the Ionian and Attic quarries. The
ruins are of brick, and not considerable; consisting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>of pieces of ordinary wall, and an octagon building
with niches, which, it is supposed, was the temple,
with a circular peristyle. These stand detached from
each other, ranging in a vale southward from the
wide bed of the river Peneus, which, by the margin,
has several large stones, perhaps the relics of the
gymnasium.</p>

<p>The ruins of Elis, says Mr. Dodwell, are few and
uninteresting. Of Grecian remains nothing is seen
but a confused wreck of scattered blocks. There are
some masses of brick-work, and an octagon tower
of the same materials, which appears to be of Roman
origin. It is surprising that there should be so few
remains of the temples, porticoes, theatres, and other
edifices, which embellished the town at the time of
Pausanias; but some suppose that much is covered
by the earth; since it is considerably higher than its
original level<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="NO_XXXV_EPHESUS" id="NO_XXXV_EPHESUS"></a>NO. XXXV.&mdash;EPHESUS.</h2>


<p>This city was once reputed the metropolis of Asia;
and thence it was styled Epiphanestata, a name
signifying "Monstrous." It was at first not merely
a village, but a small village; yet, in the time of
Strabo, it was the largest and most frequented emporium
of all that continent. It was situated in
Ionia, about 50 miles south of Smyrna, near the
mouth of the river Cayster. Pliny tells us, that
before his age, it had been known by various names.
In the time of the Trojan war, it was called Alopes;
soon after, Ortygia, and Morges; then it took the
name of Smyrna; then Samornium, and Ptelea.
"It is mounted on a hill," says he, "and hath the
river Cayster under it, which cometh out of the
Cilbian hills, and brings down with it the waters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
of many other rivers; but is principally maintained
and enriched by the lake Pegaseum, which discharges
itself by the river Phyrites, that runs into it. A
large quantity of mud is brought down, which increases
the land; for already, a good way within the
land, is an island called Phyrie, nearly joined to the
continent."</p>

<p>Pliny, and several other ancient writers, assert
that this city was founded by the Amazons; but
others, with greater probability, ascribe that honour
to a party emigrating from Athens. As this emigration
was important, we shall pause a little upon
it. It is called the Ionic emigration. It was led
from Athens by two young men, named Neleus and
Androcles, the younger sons of Codrus the king.
Multitudes followed them, especially certain Ionian
and Messenian families, who had taken refuge in
that city after the Dorian conquest. On landing,
they seized upon four hundred miles<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> of Asia
Minor, together with the islands of Samos and Chios;
and having driven out the Carians and Segetes,
founded twelve cities. Of these Ephesus was one<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>.
Neleus settled at Miletus; but Androcles, the elder
brother, at Ephesus. Strabo relates, that the authority
of Androcles was at first acknowledged over all
the cities; but that a republican government was
soon after established, and that the municipality of
each city claimed sovereign authority; the whole
being, nevertheless, united by confederacy; having,
for considering their common affairs, a general council.
This council was called Panionium.</p>

<p>This form of government continued to the time of
Pythagoras, who lived before Cyrus the Great, and
was one of the most savage tyrants of whom history<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
makes mention. He was succeeded by Pyndarus,
who ruled with a less absolute and cruel sway; in
whose time Ephesus was besieged by Cr&#339;sus, king
of Lydia. That prince advised the inhabitants to
dedicate their city to Diana; and they having resolved
to follow his advice, he treated them with
kindness, and restored them to their former liberty.
The other tyrants, mentioned in Ephesian history,
were, Athenagoras, Comes, Aristarchus, and Hegesias.
The last of these governed under the patronage
of Alexander<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>. That conqueror, however, at length
expelled him; and, having done so, bestowed upon
the temple of Diana, after having defeated the Persians
on the banks of the Granicus,&mdash;all the tributes
which the Ephesians had been accustomed to pay to
the Persian kings. He also established a democracy
in the city.</p>

<p>Ephesus was greatly assisted, also, by Lysander
the Lacedemonian. Plutarch relates, that when that
person went to Ephesus, he found that city well
disposed to the Lacedemonians, but in a bad condition
as to its internal policy, and in danger of falling into
the hands of the Persians; because it was near
Lydia, and the king's lieutenants often visited it.
Lysander, therefore, having fixed his quarters there,
ordered all his store-ships to be brought into the
harbour, and built a dock for his galleys. By these
means he filled the ports with merchants, their
markets with business, and their houses and shops
with money. So that from that time, and from his
services, continues Plutarch, Ephesus began to conceive
hopes of that greatness and splendour in which
it afterwards flourished.</p>

<p>We must now describe the temple at this place,
dedicated to Diana. It was in part built by the
hands of kings. It was four hundred and twenty-five
feet long and two hundred feet broad, and not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
only adorned with the choicest paintings and statues,
but with whatever the hand of art or genius could
produce in that day of superior execution and magnificence.
The roof was supported by one hundred
and twenty-seven columns, sixty feet high. Of
these, thirty-six were carved in a most exquisite
manner: nor was it entirely completed till two hundred
and twenty years after its first foundation. Its
architect was Ctesiphon. The riches placed in this
temple were very great, and the goddess was represented
as crowned with turrets, holding in her arms
lions; while a number of beasts seemed to indicate
the fertility and resources of the earth, or of nature.
It was formed of ebony; and Pliny states, that
though the staircase, which led up to the top of this
edifice, was not very narrow, it was formed out of the
trunk of one single vine.</p>

<p>This temple was destroyed on the day on which
Alexander was born. It was burnt by an Ephesian,
who thus desired to immortalise his name. In
order to frustrate the accomplishment of this desire,
the Ephesians enacted a law, that no one should
even be guilty of mentioning his name. The name
of Eratostratus, nevertheless, has descended to posterity.</p>

<p>Such is the account left us by Plutarch and
Valerius Maximus. On this occasion, Hegesias, the
Magnesian, "uttered a conceit," says Plutarch,
"frigid enough to have extinguished the flames."
"It is no wonder," said he, "that the temple of
Diana was burnt, when she was at a distance employed
in bringing Alexander into the world."<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>All the Magi, continues Plutarch, who were then
at Ephesus, looked upon the fire as a sign which
betokened a much greater misfortune;&mdash;they ran
about the town beating their faces, and crying,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
"that the day had brought forth the greatest scourge
and destroyer of Asia."</p>

<p>Barthelemy makes Anacharsis visit Ephesus some
few years after this calamity. Nothing then remained
of this superb temple but the four walls and
some columns in the midst of ruins. The fire had
consumed the roof and the ornaments which decorated
the nave. Alexander offered to rebuild this
edifice; but the offer being accompanied by the condition,
that the Ephesians should inscribe his name
upon it as that of the benefactor; the Ephesians
refused to accept his offer. They, nevertheless, refused
in a manner that gave him, no doubt, a superior
satisfaction. It was, that one deity ought not to
raise a temple to another!</p>

<p>At the time Barthelemy has named, the temple
was beginning to be rebuilt<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>. All the citizens had
contributed, and the women had sacrificed their
jewels. No change was made in the form of the
goddess' statue; a form anciently borrowed from the
Egyptians, and which was found, also, in the temples
of several other Greek cities. The goddess
bore on her head a tower; two iron rods supported
her hands; and the body terminated in a
sheath, encircled with symbols and the figures of
animals.</p>

<p>Thirty-six of the columns were carved by Scopas,
of the school of Praxiteles<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>, and it was in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
temple that the Ionic order in architecture was first
employed; and every column contained one hundred
and ten tons of marble<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>.</p>

<p>In the war between the Romans and Mithridates,
the Ephesians took part with the latter; and by his
command went even so far as to massacre all the
Romans in their city<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>. For this atrocity they were
severely fined, and reduced almost to beggars.</p>

<p>Whoever might have originally founded this city,
certain it is that the town, which in the Roman
times was the metropolis of Asia, was founded by
Lysimachus; he having caused the first city to be
destroyed. When he had effected that, he rebuilt it
in a more convenient place.</p>

<p>This new city became very splendid in process of
time; but it was greatly damaged in the reign of
Tiberius by an earthquake. On this Tiberius ordered
it to be repaired and adorned with many stately
buildings; and of that city the ruins which are now
visible are the remains.</p>

<p>Ephesus was in subsequent times sacked by the
Goths, and the temple of Diana again burnt to the
ground. The ruin of the temple is thus described by
Gibbon:&mdash;"In the general calamities of mankind,
the death of an individual, however exalted, the ruin
of an edifice, however famous, are passed over with
careless inattention. Yet, we cannot forget that the
temple of Diana at Ephesus, after having risen with
increasing splendour from seven repeated misfortunes<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>,
was finally burnt by the Goths in their third<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
naval invasion. The arts of Greece, and the wealth
of Asia, had conspired to erect that sacred and
magnificent structure. It was supported by one
hundred and twenty-seven marble columns of the
Ionic order. They were the gifts of devout monarchs,
and each was sixty feet high. The altar was
adorned with the masterly sculpture of Praxiteles,
who had, perhaps, selected from the favourite legends
of the place, the birth of the divine children of Latona,
the concealment of Apollo after the slaughter of the
Cyclops, and the clemency of Bacchus to the vanquished
Amazons<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>. Yet the length of the temple of
Ephesus was only four hundred and twenty-five feet;
about two-thirds of the measurement of the church
of St. Peter's at Rome<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>. In the other dimensions it
was still inferior to that sublime production of modern
architecture. The spreading arms of a Christian
cross require a much greater breadth than the oblong
temples of the pagans; and the boldest architect of
antiquity would have been startled at the proposal
of raising in the air a dome of the size and proportions
of the Pantheon. The temple of Diana was,
however, admired as one of the wonders of the world.
Successive empires, the Persian, Macedonian, and the
Roman, had revered its sanctity, and enriched its
splendour. But the rude savages of the Baltic were
destitute of a taste for the elegant arts, and they despised
the ideal terrors of a foreign superstition<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>."</p>

<p>In regard to this temple, some have supposed
that the subterranean arches still existing are the
remains of it. This, however, cannot be allowed.
"A Sybilline oracle," says Sir John Hobhouse, "fore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>told,
that the earth would tremble and open, and that
this glorious edifice would fall headlong into the abyss;
and present appearances might justify the belief, that
it was swept from the face of the earth by some overwhelming
catastrophe." "It is easier to conceive,"
he goes on to observe, "that such an event, although
unnoticed, did take place, than that a marble temple,
four hundred and twenty feet long, and two hundred
and twenty feet broad, whose columns (one hundred
and twenty-seven in number) were sixty feet high,
should have left no other vestige than two fragments
of wall, some brick subterraneous arches, and four
granite pillars." Certain it is that large portions of
this city were carried away at various times to assist
in building or adorning other cities, more especially
Constantinople. "It is probable," says Hobhouse,
"that Christian zeal accelerated the devastations of
time; and that the Ephesians, in order to prevent the
punishment denounced against the seven churches of
Asia, may have been eager to demolish this monument
of their glory and their shame. The cedar roofs,
the cypress doors, the vine staircase, the sculptured
column of Scopas, the altar adorned by Praxiteles,
the paintings of Parrhasius and Apelles, and the ebony
image of the goddess, may have fallen before the
enemies of pagan idolatry; and the piety of the
priests might have been more injurious to Diana than
the rapacity of the Goths; but neither the cupidity
nor audacity of the reformers, against whom the
sophist Libanius,&mdash;an eye-witness of their progress,&mdash;so
forcibly exclaims, could have destroyed, although
they might have defaced, the vast fabric of the
Artemisium itself."</p>

<p>Under the reign of Alexius, father of the celebrated
Anna de Comnena, Ephesus fell under the dominion
of the Mahometans. In <small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 1206, the Greeks
retook it; but seventy-seven years after they lost it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
again. At the commencement of the fourteenth century,
it became a part of the Turkish dominions, and
has remained so ever since.</p>

<p>Ephesus is greatly distinguished in ecclesiastical
history. "First," says Rees, "it may be considered
as the abode of many Jews, who obtained the privilege
of citizens; and afterwards as the place where
the first Paul took up his residence for three years<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>;
where he wrought miracles<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>, and was resisted by
the Jews<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>; and where Timothy was bishop; and
where John resided; and moreover, as containing
one of the seven churches whose character and doom
are recorded by that evangelist in the book of the
Revelation<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>."</p>

<p>We now pass to the times in which we live; and
shall present descriptions of the ruins of this once
noble city, in the language of those who have visited
them.</p>

<p>Aiasaluck is situated about thirteen or fourteen
hours from Smyrna. It is now a small village, inhabited
by a few Turkish families, standing chiefly on
the south of a hill, called the Castle-hill, among
bushes and ruins. Near a caravanserai is a marble sarcophagus,
which serves as a water-trough to a well
before it. It bears an inscription; and from that is
learnt, that it once contained the bodies of the commander
of a Roman trireme named the Griffin, and
his wife. "We sat near this sarcophagus," says Dr.
Chandler, "in the open air, while our supper was preparing;
when suddenly fires began to blaze up among
the bushes, and we saw the villagers collected about
them in savage groups, or passing to and fro with
lighted brands for torches. The flames, with the
stars and a pale moon, afforded us a dire prospect
of ruin and desolation. A shrill owl, named Cucu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>vaia
from its note, with a night-hawk, flitted near
us; and a jackal cried mournfully, as if forsaken
by his companions on the mountain." Such was
the scene where Ephesus had been! "We retired,"
continues this elegant and accomplished traveller,
"early in the evening to our shed; not without some
sensations of melancholy, which were renewed at
the dawn of day. We had then a distinct view of
a solemn and most forlorn spot; a neglected castle,
a grand mosque, and a broken aqueduct, with mean
cottages, and ruinous buildings, interspersed among
wild thickets, and spreading to a considerable extent.
Many of the scattered structures are squares,
with domes, and have been baths. Some gravestones
occurred, finely painted and gilded, as the Turkish
manner is, with characters in relievo. But the
castle, the mosque, and the aqueduct, are alone sufficient
evidences, as well of the former greatness of
the place, as of its importance."</p>

<p>The castle is a large and barbarous edifice, with
square towers. You ascend to it over heaps of
stones, intermixed with scraps of marble. "An
outwork," continues Dr. Chandler, "which secured
the approach, once consisted of two lateral walls from
the body of the fortress, with a gateway. This is
supported on each side by a huge and awkward buttress,
constructed chiefly with the seats of a theatre,
or stadium, many marked with Greek letters. Several
fragments of inscriptions are inserted in it, or
lie near. Over the arch are four pieces of ancient
sculpture. Two in the middle are in alto-relievo, of
most exquisite workmanship, and parts of the same
design; representing the death of Patroclus, and the
bringing of his body to Achilles." A third is in
basso-relievo. "The figures are, a man leading away
a little boy, a corpse extended, two women lamenting,
and soldiers bearing forth the armour and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
weapons of the deceased, to decorate his funeral pile."
This referred to the story of Hector. The fourth is
much injured, but sufficient remains to show boys and
vine-branches. The gateway faces the sea. Within
the castle were a few huts, an old mosque, and a
great deal of rubbish. "If you move a stone, it is
a chance but you find a scorpion under it."</p>

<p>The grand mosque is situated beneath the castle.
The side next the foot of the hill is of stone; the rest
of polished marble, veined. In front is a court,
having a large fountain; there are, also, broken
columns&mdash;remains of a portico. The fabric was
raised with old materials; and the large granite
columns which sustain the roof, as well as all the
marbles, are remains of what were long supposed to
constitute ancient Ephesus.</p>

<p>In regard to the aqueduct, the piers are square;
not large, but many, with arches formed with brick.
These are constructed with inscribed pedestals, on one
of which is the name of Herodes Atticus, whose statue
it once supported. These ruins abound in snakes.
Chamelions and lizards, also, are frequently seen
basking in the sun. "The marbles, yet untouched,
would form a copious and curious harvest, if accessible.
The downfall of some may be expected continually,
from the tottering condition of the fabric;
and time and earthquakes will supply the place of
ladders; for which the traveller wishes in vain at a
place, where, if a tall man, he may almost overlook
the houses."</p>

<p>And yet these ruins, strictly speaking, are in Dr.
Chandler's opinion not those of Ephesus: those lie
nearer the sea; and are visible from the castle hill.
The ruins of Aiasaluck are those of a town, built in
great part, if not entirely, of Ephesian ruins; and
it may be supposed, by the Mahometan potentate,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
Mantakhia, who conquered Ephesus and all Caria,
in the year 1313.</p>

<p>The site of Ephesus is to be sought for in the way
from Aiasaluck to a square tower of white marble,
which stands on a ridge, projecting from the chain of
Corissus, the southern boundary of the plain of the Cayster.
For about half a mile from the village the route
is over a flat, interspersed with thickets of tamarinds,
agnus-castus, and other shrubs; it then arrives at a
low round hill which extends to the north-east from
the high range of Corissus. All the inhabitants of the
once famous Ephesus, the chief of this part of Asia, as
the mistress governing the rest, by the residence of
the proconsul here, amount now not to above forty
or fifty families of Turks, living in poor thatched
cottages, without, says Wheler, one Christian
among them. They lie in a knot together, on the
south side of the castle. "Within the gate, on the
castle wall," continues he, "we saw a marble,
whereon is cut a face, representing the moon, with
two snakes; one on one side of the head, and the
other on the other; joining their heads in the middle
of the crown, and their tails pointing outwards; with
each of them a circle in such shape, they both represent
a bow. This was to represent the deity
Hecate triformis; the moon in the heavens, represented
by the large round visage; Proserpine in
Hell, represented by the snakes; and Diana upon
earth by the bow."</p>

<p>All the principal part of the ruins are on the side
of the hill, lately mentioned, and in a flat recess
between the west side of it and the high mountains.
On the slope of the hill which is called Pion, or
Prion (sometimes Lepre Acte), is a large arch of
white marble, built, like the aqueduct before mentioned,
from ancient ruins. On another part of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
hill are two arches and vestiges of a theatre. This
was, doubtless, the theatre into which the people
rushed, shouting, "Great is Diana!" when St. Paul,
by his preaching, produced a tumult at Ephesus. In
both wings of this theatre, the seats and the ruins of
the proscenium of which are removed, are several
architectural fragments; and over an arch, once one
of the avenues, is an inscription, enjoining the reader:
"<i>If he did not think proper to approach the festive
scene, at least to be pleased with the skill of the architect,
who had saved a vast circle of the theatre; all-conquering
time having yielded to the succour he had
contrived.</i>"</p>

<p>Coming to a narrow valley, broken columns and
pieces of marble are observed, with vestiges of an
Odeum, or music-room; this is stripped of the seats,
and is naked. Beyond this are the remains of a large
edifice, greatly resembling the one with an arcade at
Troas. The top of one of the niches is painted with
waves and fishes; and amongst the fragments lying in
the front are two trunks of statues, of great size, without
heads and almost buried; the drapery of which is
both the same, alike remarkable. This was the gymnasium.
"We pitched our tents," says Dr. Chandler,
"among the ruins of this huge building, when we
arrived from Claros, and employed on it three days in
taking a plan and view. We found the area green
with corn, and the site in general overrun with fennel,
in seed, the stalks strong and tall."</p>

<p>At the entrance from Aiasaluck is a street, and
from the remains still existing, it must have been a
noble one. The edifices must have been, also, ample
ones, with colonnades. There are many bases and
pedestals of columns; and the vaulted substructions
of the fabrics are still entire.</p>

<p>Turning towards the sea, the traveller is greeted
with the sight of a prostrate heap, once forming a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
temple. The cell, or nave, was constructed of large,
coarse stones. This temple had four columns between
the ant&aelig;. Their diameter is about four feet six
inches; their length about thirty-two feet; but,
including the base and capital, forty-six feet and
about seven inches. Though the dimensions of these
pillars was so great, the shafts are fluted. The most
entire of them, however, are broken into two pieces.
The ornaments were rich; but "of inferior taste,
and the mouldings ill proportioned<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>." This temple
is supposed to be the remains of that erected at
Ephesus, by permission of Augustus, to the god
Julius. Some, however, have imagined that it might
have been that dedicated to Claudius C&aelig;sar on his
apotheosis.</p>

<p>About a mile from this are the remnants of a
sumptuous edifice; among the bushes beneath which
are altars of white marble. These stand upon an
eminence; and from that is beheld a lovely prospect
of the river Cayster, which there crosses the plain
from near Gellesus, into a small but full stream, and
with many luxuriant windings.</p>

<p>Mount Prion, according to Chandler, is among
the curiosities of Ionia enumerated by Pausanias.
It has served as an inexhaustible magazine of marble,
and contributed largely to the magnificence of the
city. "The Ephesians, it is related, when they first
resolved to provide an edifice worthy of Diana, met
to agree on importing materials. The quarries, then
in use, were remote, and the expense, it was foreseen,
would be prodigious. At this time a shepherd happened
to be feeding his flock on mount Prion<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
two rams fighting, one of them missed his antagonist,
and, striking the rock with his horn, broke off a
crust of very white marble. He ran into the city
with this specimen, which was received with excess
of joy. He was highly honoured for this accidental
discovery; the Ephesians changing his name from
Pixodorus to Evangelus, <i>the good messenger</i>, and
enjoining their chief magistrate, under a penalty, to
visit the spot, and to sacrifice to him monthly."
This custom continued to be observed, even so late
as the time of Augustus C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>Not far from the gymnasium, are cavities with
mouths, like ovens, forming burial-places, made to
admit bodies, which were thrust in. This was supposed
to have belonged to the oratory or church of
St. John, rebuilt by Justinian. Near the city, also,
are quarries in the bowels of the mountain, with
numberless mazes, and vast, silent, dripping caverns.
In many parts of this, Dr. Chandler informs us, are
chippings of marble and marks of tools. He found
chippings, also, which supplied marble for the city
wall, and huge pieces lying among the bushes at the
bottom.</p>

<p>The Ephesians, at the time in which the learned
traveller to whom in this account we have so frequently
referred, were a few Greek peasants, living
in extreme wretchedness, dependence, and insensibility;
"the representatives of an illustrious people,
and exhibiting the wreck of their greatness; some,
the substructions of the glorious edifices which they
raised; some beneath the vaults of the stadium,
once the crowded scene of their diversions; and
some by the abrupt precipice, in the sepulchres, which
received their ashes."</p>

<p>These ruins were visited by Sir John Hob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>house.
"The desolate walls of the mosque of St.
John, and the whole scene of Aiasaluck," says
he, "cannot but suggest a train of melancholy reflections.
The decay of these religions is thus
presented, at one view, to the eye of the traveller!
The marble spoils of the Grecian temple adorn the
mouldering edifice, over which the tower of the
Mussulman, the emblem of another triumphant worship,
is itself seen to totter, and sink into the mouldering
ruins." Not a single inhabitant, not even
a shepherd's hut, was to be seen on the actual site
of this once resplendent city! "Its streets are
obscure and overgrown," says Chandler. "A herd
of goats was driven to it for shelter from the sun at
noon; and a noisy flight of crows from the quarries
seemed to insult its silence. We heard the partridge
call in the area of the theatre, and of the stadium.
The glorious pomp of its heathen worship is no
longer remembered; and Christianity, which was
there nursed by apostles, and fostered by general
councils, until it increased in fulness of stature, barely
lingers on in an existence hardly visible."</p>

<p>Since this, the state of Christianity there has fallen
still lower. In 1812, one Greek, who was a baker,
living at Aiasaluck, and three or four fishermen, who
lived in sheds near the river, were the only Christians
to be found in the city of Ephesus<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>.</p>

<p>This city is placed among those of the Decapolis,
in Matthew, vii. 28; and it is from a rock near it,
from which the swine are described as having ran
down into the Dead Sea. By some it is included in
C&#339;losyria; by others in Arabia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>The ruins of this city were discovered by the well
known traveller, M. Seetzen (Conseiller d'Ambassade
de S. M. l'Empereur de Russie). His letters
were addressed to M. von Zach, Grand Marshal of
the court of Saxe Gotha, and part of them appeared,
at different times, in the Moniteur. Some members
of the National Institute sent over these papers to Sir
Joseph Banks, by whom they were forwarded to the
Palestine Association.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting portions of this journal
is that, which comprises the account of the ruins
of Jerrash, situated in about the centre of the Holy
Land, the dilapidated buildings of which had, till
then, escaped the notice of its lovers of antiquity,
and which, for beauty and importance, may be compared
to those of Palmyra and Balbec.</p>

<p>"<i>Jerrash</i>," says our journalist, "is situated in
an open and tolerably fertile plain, through which
a river runs. Before entering the town, I found
several sarcophagi, with very beautiful bas-reliefs,
among which I remarked one, on the edge of the
road, with a Greek inscription. The walls of the
town are mouldered away, but one may yet trace
their whole extent, which may have been three-quarters
of a league, or a whole one. These walls
were entirely built of hewn marble. The ground
within it is of unequal heights, and falls towards
the river. Not a single private house remains entire;
but on the other hand, I observed several public
buildings which were distinguished by a very beautiful
style of architecture. I found two superb amphitheatres,
solidly built of marble, with columns,
niches, &amp;c. the whole in good preservation. I found
also some palaces, and three temples, one of which
has a peristyle of twelve grand columns of the
Corinthian order, eleven of which are still upright.
In another of these temples, I saw a column on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
ground, of most beautiful polished Egyptian granite.
I also found a handsome gate of the city, well
preserved, formed of three arcades, and ornamented
with pilasters.</p>

<p>"The most beautiful thing I discovered was a
long street, crossed by another, and ornamented on
both sides with a row of marble columns of the
Corinthian order, and one of whose extremities
terminated in a semicircle, that was set round with
sixty pillars, of the Ionic order. At the points
where the two streets cross, in each of the four
angles, a large pedestal of hewn stone is visible, on
which probably statues were formerly set. A part
of the pavement remains, formed of hewn stones.</p>

<p>"To speak generally, I counted about two hundred
columns, which yet partly support their entablatures,
but the number of those overthrown is
infinitely more considerable: I saw indeed but half
the extent of the town, and a person would probably
still find in the other half, on the opposite side of
the river, a quantity of remarkable curiosities.</p>

<p>"Jerrash can be no other than the ancient Geresa,
one of the Decapolitan towns. It is difficult to conceive
that so much ignorance of its real situation
should exist, as would allow Monsieur Paulus, in
his map, to have placed it to the <i>north</i>-east of the
northern extremity of the Lake of Tiberias. I do
not know whether any ancient geographer has made
the same mistake. From a fragment of a Greek
inscription, which I copied, I am led to conclude,
that several of the buildings of this town were
erected under the Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.
The Roman history may, perhaps, furnish
some data in corroboration of this conjecture. It is,
at all events, certain, that the edifices of this town
are of the age of the most beautiful Roman architecture."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>Gerasa has been since visited by other travellers,
from whose report we learn, that the principal curiosities
of antiquity are, a temple adorned in front
with a double row of six columns in each row, of
which nine are standing; and on each side of the
temple there remains one column belonging to the
single row of pillars, that surrounded the temple on
every side except the front. Of these eleven columns
are entire, and two are without capitals. They are
of the Corinthian order; their capitals being beautifully
ornamented with the acanthus leaf. The interior
of this temple is choked with the ruins of the
roof. The number of columns which originally
adorned the temple and its area, was not less than
from 200 to 250. "The whole edifice," says
Burckhardt<sup>*</sup>, "seems to have been superior in taste
and magnificence to every public building of the
kind in Syria,&mdash;the temple of the Sun at Palmyra
excepted."</p>

<p>To the west of this, at about two hundred yards
distance, are the remains of a small temple, with
three Corinthian pillars, still standing. Not far
from this are two colonnades, of which thirty broken
shafts are yet standing, and two entire columns, but
without capitals; and opposite to these are five
columns, with their capitals and entablatures. Originally
there were about fifty.</p>

<p>At a short distance from these there are other
columns, much larger; and still farther on seventeen
Corinthian, all of which are united by their entablature.
Some of these are twenty-one, some twenty-five,
and others thirty feet high. Their entablatures
are slightly ornamented with sculptured bas-reliefs.</p>

<p>In other parts of the ruins are other columns; and
a large open space is enclosed by a magnificent semicircle
of columns in a single row; fifty-seven
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>columns are yet standing; originally, it is supposed,
there were sixty. On entering the forum there are
four, and then twenty-one, united by their entablatures.
To the left, five, seven, and twenty, united
in the same manner. They are of the Ionic order;
thus differing from all the others.</p>

<p>At the end of a semicircle are several basins, which
seem to have been reservoirs of water; and remains
of an aqueduct are still visible. To the right and
left are some other chambers. From this spot the
ground rises; and on mounting a low but steep hill,
Mr. Burckhardt found on its top a beautiful temple,
commanding a view over the greater part of the
town. Not far from this are the remains of a
theatre. It fronted the town; so that the spectators,
seated on the highest row of benches, enjoyed
the prospect of all its buildings and quarters. At
the back runs the town wall.</p>

<p>In another part of the town are found in every
direction columns of considerable height, some still
standing, others lying prostrate, some having inscriptions
on their pedestals. In many parts, the streets
are absolutely rendered impassable from fragments;
indeed we have not space to describe all that is to
be seen among these splendid remains. There are
190 columns still standing, and 100 half columns.
In respect to private habitations, there are none in
a state of preservation; but the whole of the area
within the walls is covered with their ruins.</p>

<p>In one of the temples Mr. Irby noticed a curious
singularity, viz.&mdash;a chamber under ground, below the
principal hall of one of the temples, with a bath in
the centre. "There are numerous inscriptions in
all directions," says Mr. Irby, "chiefly of the time
of Antoninus Pius; most of them much mutilated.
On the whole, we hold Djerash to be a much finer
mass of ruins than Palmyra. This city has three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
entrances of richly ornamented gateways; and the
remains of the wall, with its occasional towers, are
in wonderful preservation.</p>

<p>"Gerasa," says Mr. Robinson, "was nearly
square, each side something less than a mile, the
walls crossing the river in two places at right angles;
the other two sides being parallel to each other on
opposite sides of the hill. The greater part of the
inclosed space is covered with the ruins of houses,
forming a deep contrast with the elegant specimens
of art, whichever way the eye is turned. From the
triumphal arch on the south-west side to the wall
inclosing the north-east, along both sides of the
stream, the whole space is covered; also east and
west of it, up the sides of the hill. There are several
small eminences within the walls, from one of which,
near the northern theatre, the view of columns seems
interminable, and that of the rest of the ruins is
beyond every thing attractive from this spot;&mdash;it is
indeed a perfect gallery of art."</p>

<p>The smaller theatre, Mr. Robinson is inclined to
believe, was used for purposes different from the
other; the area below the seats being more extensive,
and furnished with a suite of dark, arched chambers,
opening into it. The latter was, probably, used to
confine the wild beasts destined to combat in the
arena; such exhibitions being in vogue at the time
Gerasa may be supposed to have flourished<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="NO_XXXVII_GRANADA" id="NO_XXXVII_GRANADA"></a>NO. XXXVII.&mdash;GRANADA.</h2>


<p>The city of Granada<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> has twelve gates; and is
about eight miles round, defended by high walls,
flanked with a multitude of towers. Its situation
is of a mixed kind; some parts of it being
upon the mountain, and other parts in the plain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
The mountainous part stands upon three small
eminences; the one is called Albrezzin; which was
inhabited by the Moors that were driven out of
Baezza by the Christians. The second is called
Alcazebe; and the third Alhambra. This last is
separated from the other parts by a valley, through
which the river Darro runs; and it is also fortified
with strong walls, in such a manner as to command
all the rest of the city. The greatest part of this
fortified spot of ground is taken up with a most
sumptuous palace of the Moorish kings. This palace
is built with square stones of great dimensions; and
is fortified with strong walls and prodigious large
towers; and the whole is of such an extent as to be
capable of holding a very numerous garrison. The
outside has exactly the appearance of an immense
romantic old castle; but it is exceedingly magnificent
within.</p>

<p>But before we enter, we must take notice of a
remarkable piece of sculpture over the great gate;
there is the figure of a large key of a castle-gate, and
at some distance above it, there is an arm reaching
towards it; and the signification of this emblematical
marble basso-relief is this:&mdash;that the castles will never
be taken till the arm can reach the key.</p>

<p>Upon entering, not only the portico is of marble,
but the apartments also are incrusted with marble,
jasper, and porphyry, and the beams curiously carved,
painted, and gilt; and the ceilings ornamented with
pieces of foliage in stucco. The next place you come
to is an oblong-square court, paved with marble, at each
angle of which there is a fountain, and in the middle
there is a very fine canal of running water. The
baths and chambers, where they cooled themselves and
reposed, are incrusted with alabaster and marble.
There is an exceeding venerable tower, called La
Toure Comazey; in which are noble saloons, and fine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
apartments; and all perfectly well supplied with
water. In the time of the Moors, there was a kind
of espalier, or cut hedge of myrtle, accompanied with
a row of orange trees, which went round the canal.</p>

<p>From thence you pass into an exceeding fine
square, which is called the Square of Lions, from a
noble fountain, which is adorned with twelve lions
cut in marble, pouring out a vast torrent of water at its
mouth; and when the water is turned off, and ceases
to run, if you whisper ever so low at the mouth of
any one of them, you may hear what is said by applying
your ear to the mouth of any one of the rest.
Above the lions, there is another basin, and a grand
jet-d'eau. The court is paved with marble, and has
a portico quite round it, which is supported by one
hundred and seventeen high columns of alabaster. In
one of the saloons, if you whisper ever so low, it will be
distinctly heard at the further end; and this they
call the Chamber of Secrets. This sumptuous palace
was built by Mahomed Mir, king of Granada, in
1278.</p>

<p>"There is no part of the edifice," says Washington
Irving, "that gives us a more complete idea of its
original beauty and magnificence, than the Hall of
Lions, for none has suffered so little from the ravages
of time. In the centre stands the fountain, famous
in song and story. The alabaster basins still shed
their diamond drops; and the twelve lions, which
support them, cast forth their crystal streams as in
the days of Boabdil. The court is laid out in
flower-beds, surrounded by high Arabian arcades
of open filagree work, supported by slender pillars of
white marble. The architecture, like that of all the
other parts of the palace, is characterised by elegance
rather than grandeur; bespeaking a delicate and
graceful taste, and a disposition to indolent enjoyment.
When one looks upon the fair tracery of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
peristyles, and the apparently fragile fretwork of the
walls, it is difficult to believe that so much has
survived the wear and tear of centuries, the shock of
earthquakes, the violence of war, and the quiet and
no less baneful pilfering of the tasteful traveller.</p>

<p>There is a Moorish tradition, that a king who built
this mighty pile was skilled in the occult sciences,
and furnished himself with gold and silver for the
purpose by means of alchymy; certainly never was
there an edifice accomplished in a superior style of
barbaric magnificence; and the stranger who, even
at the present day, wanders among its silent and
deserted courts and ruined halls, gazes with astonishment
at its gilded and fretted domes and luxurious
decorations, still retaining their brilliancy and beauty
in spite of the ravages of time.</p>

<p>The Alhamr&#257;, usually, but erroneously, denominated
the Alhambra, is a vast pile of building about
two thousand three hundred English feet in length;
and its breadth, which is the same throughout, is
about six hundred feet. It was erected by M&#363;hammed
Ab&#363; Abdill&#257;h, surnamed Algh&#257;lib Bill&#257;h, who
superintended the edifice himself, and, when it was
completed, made it the royal residence.</p>

<p>Although the glory and prosperity of Granada
may be said to have departed with its old inhabitants,
yet, happily, it still retains, in pretty good
preservation, what formed its chief ornament in the
time of the Moors. This is the Alhambra, the
royal alcazar, or fortress and palace, which was
founded by M&#363;hammed Ab&#363;. Abdill&#257;h Ben Nasz,
the second sovereign of Granada, defrayed the expense
of the works by a tribute imposed upon his
conquered subjects. He superintended the building
in person, and when it was completed, he made it a
royal residence<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>. The immediate successors of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
prince also took delight in embellishing and making
additions to the fabric. Since the conquest of Granada
by the Christians, the Alhambra has undergone
some alterations. It was for a time occasionally
inhabited by the kings of Spain. Charles the Fifth
caused a magnificent palace to be commenced within
the walls; but owing to his wars and frequent
absences from Spain, or, as some accounts say, to
repeated shocks of earthquakes, a splendid suite of
apartments, in the Spanish style, is all that resulted
from an alleged intention to eclipse the palace of the
Moslem kings. Like the rest of the Alhambra, it is
falling rapidly to decay through neglect. At present
the walls are defaced, the paintings faded, the
wood-work is decayed, and festoons of cobwebs are
seen hanging from the ceiling. In the works of the
Arabs, on the contrary, the walls remain unaltered,
except by the injuries inflicted by the hand of man.
The beams and wood-work of the ceiling present no
signs of decay; and spiders, flies, and all other
insects, shun their apartments at every season. The
art of rendering timber and paints durable, and of
making porcelain, mosaics, arabesques, and other
ornaments, began and ended in western Europe with
the Spanish Arabs.</p>

<p>The palace has had no royal residents since the beginning
of the last century, when Philip the Fifth
was there for a short time with his queen.</p>

<p>The Alhambra is generally spoken of as a palace,
but it is to be understood, that, in the extensive
sense, the name applies to a fortress, a sort of city in
itself.</p>

<p>The palace, situated upon the northern brow of a
steep hill, overlooks the city of Granada on one side,
and on the other commands an extensive view over
a most charming country. All the wonders of this
palace lie within its walls. Externally, according to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
the account of Swinburne, it appears as a large mass
of irregular buildings, all huddled together without
any apparent intention of forming <i>one</i> habitation.
The walls are entirely unornamented, of gravel and
pebbles coarsely daubed over with plaster. We cannot
trace the successive courts and apartments, through
which the visiter passes as he penetrates to the interior,
or attempt to enumerate their separate claims
to notice.</p>

<p>The general arrangement of the buildings which
compose the palace is exceedingly simple. The
courts, for instance, which in our mansions are dull
and uninteresting, are here so planned, as to seem a
continuation of a series of apartments; and as the
whole is on the same level throughout, the prospect
through the building, in its perfect state, must have
been like a scene of enchantment or a dream; halls
and galleries, porticoes and columns, arches, mosaics,
with plants and flowers of various hues, being seen
in various extensive views, through the haze arising
from the spray of the fountains. In every part of
the palace its inmates had water in abundance, with
a perfect command over it, making it high, low,
visible, or invisible, at pleasure.</p>

<p>In every department two currents of air were continually
in motion. Also, by means of tubes of
baked earth placed in the walls, warmth was diffused
from subterranean furnaces; not only through the
whole range of the baths, but to all the contiguous
upper apartments where warmth was required. The
doors were large, but rather sparingly introduced;
and, except on the side towards the precipice, where
the prospect is very grand, the windows are so
placed as to confine the view to the interior of the
palace. The object of this is declared in an inscription
in one of the apartments, which says&mdash;"My
windows admit the light, but exclude the view of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
external objects, lest the beauties of Nature should
divert attention from the beauties of my work."</p>

<p>In this mansion the elaborate arabesques and mosaics
which cover the ceilings, walls, and floor, give a
consequence and interest even to the smallest apartment.
Instead of being papered and wainscoted,
the walls are provided with the peculiar ornament
which, from the Arabs, has been denominated "arabesque."
The receding ornaments are illuminated in
just gradation with leaf-gold, pink, light blue, and
dusky purple: the first colour is the nearest, the last
is the most distant, from the eye; but the general
surface is white. The domes and arcades are also
covered with ornamented casts, which are as light as
wood, and as durable as marble.</p>

<p>Besides the inscriptions above alluded to, there
are various others. In the king's bath, and in various
other parts of the Alhambra, is, "There is no conqueror
but God;" and "Glory to our Lord, Sultan
Ab&#363; Abdall&#257;h!"</p>

<p>Over the principal door of the golden saloon, or
hall of ambassadors: "By the sun and its rising brightness;
by the moon, when she followeth him; by the
day, when he showeth his splendour; by the night,
when it covereth him into darkness; by the heaven,
and Him who created it; by the earth, and Him who
spread it forth; by the soul, and Him who completely
formed it: there is no other God but God."</p>

<p>The gate of judgment was erected by Sultan Abu
Yusuff, <small>A.&nbsp;H.</small> 749. or <small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 1348, as appears from an
Arabic inscription over it. On each side of that inscription
is a block of marble, containing (in Arabic)
"Praise be to God. There is no God but God, and
Mahomet is his prophet. There is no strength but
from God."</p>

<p>In one of the windows on the right hand of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
saloon are the following verses, descriptive of its
elegance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I am the ornamented seat of the bride, endowed with beauty
and perfection.</p>

<p>"Dost thou doubt it? Look, then, at this basin, and thou wilt
be fully convinced of the truth of my assertion.</p>

<p>"Regard, also, my tiara; thou wilt find it resembling that of
the crescent moon.</p>

<p>"And Ibn Nasr is the sun of my orb, in the splendour of
beauty.</p>

<p>"May he continue in the (noon-tide) altitude of glory, secure
(from change) whilst the sun sets and disappears."</p></div>

<p>At the entrance of the tower of Comares: "The
kingdom is God's;" "The tower is God's;" "Durability
is God's."</p>

<p>In the middle of the golden saloon: "There is no
God but God, the Sovereign, the True, the Manifest.
Muhamud is the just, the faithful messenger
of God. I flee to God for protection from Satan:
the pelted with stones.. In the name of God the
merciful, the forgiving; there is no God but He,
the living, the eternal; sleep nor slumber seizeth
Him. To Him (belongeth) whatever is in the heavens,
and whatever is in the earth; who is there who
shall intercede with him except by His permission?
He knoweth what is before them, and what is
behind them; and they comprehend not His wisdom,
except what he pleaseth. He hath extended
His throne, the heavens, and the earth; the protection
of which incommodeth Him not; and he is the exalted,
the great! There is no forcing in the faith. Truly,
righteousness is distinguished from error. He, therefore,
who disbelieveth in (the idol) T&#257;g&#363;t, and
believeth in God, hath taken hold of a sure handle,
that cannot be broken. God heareth, knoweth the
truth of God."</p>

<p>The walls of the alcoves in the Court del Aqua,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
present, also, various effusions of the Muse, which
have been inscribed by various travellers; amongst
which this:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"When these famed walls did Pagan rites admit,<br />
Here reigned unrivalled breeding, science, wit.<br />
Christ's standard came, the prophet's flag assailed,<br />
And fix'd true worship where the false prevailed:<br />
And, such the zeal its pious followers bore,<br />
Wit, science, breeding, perished with the Moor."<br />
</p>

<p>"On looking from the royal villa or pleasure-house
of &Aacute;l Generalife," says Mr. Murphy, "the
spectator beholds the side of the Alhambra that commands
the quarter of the city called the Albrezzin.
The massive towers are connected by solid walls,
constructed upon the system of fortification, which
generally prevailed in the middle ages. Those walls
and towers follow all the turnings and windings of
the mountain; and previously to the invention of
gunpowder and artillery, this fortress must have been
almost impregnable. The situation of this edifice is
the most delightful and commanding that can be
conceived. Wherever the spectator may turn his
eyes, it is impossible for him not to be struck with
admiration at the picturesque beauty and fertility of
the surrounding country. On the north and west,
as far as the eye can reach, a lovely plain presents
itself, which is covered with an immense number of
trees laden with fruit and blossoms; while, on the
south, it is bounded by mountains, whose lofty summits
are crowned with perpetual snows, whence issue
the springs and streams that diffuse both health and
coolness through the city of Granada."</p>

<p>"But," in the language of Mr. Swinburne, "the
glories of Granada have passed away; its streets are
choked with filth; its woods destroyed; its territory
depopulated; its trade lost. In a word, everything,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
except the church and the law, is in the most deplorable
condition<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>."</p>

<h2><a name="NO_XXXVIII_GNIDOS" id="NO_XXXVIII_GNIDOS"></a>NO. XXXVIII.&mdash;GNIDOS.</h2>


<p>This was a maritime city of Asia Minor, founded
by the Dorians, and much known on account of a
victory, which Conon gained over the Lacedemonians.
Conon was an Athenian, having the command
of the Persian fleet; Pisander, brother-in-law
of Agesilaus, of the Lacedemonian. Conon's fleet
consisted of ninety galleys; that of Pisander something
less. They came in view of each other near
Gnidos. Conon took fifty of the enemy's ships. The
allies of the Spartans fled, and their chief admiral
died fighting to the last, sword in hand.</p>

<p>Gnidos was famed for having produced the most
renowned sculptors and architects of Greece; amongst
whom were Sostratus and Sesostris, who built the
celebrated light-tower on the isle of Pharos, considered
one of the seven wonders of the world, and
whence all similar edifices were afterwards denominated.</p>

<p>Venus, surnamed the Gnidian, was the chief
deity of this place, where she had a temple, greatly
celebrated for a marble statue of the goddess. This
beautiful image was the masterpiece of Praxiteles,
who had infused into it all the soft graces and attractions
of his favourite Phryne; and it became so celebrated,
that travellers visited the spot with great
eagerness. It represented the goddess in her naked
graces, erect in posture, and with her right hand
covering her waist; but every feature and every part
was so naturally expressed, that the whole seemed to
be animated<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<p>"We were shown, as we passed by," says Anacharsis,
"the house in which Eudoxus, the astronomer,
made his observations; and soon after found
ourselves in the presence of the celebrated Venus of
Praxiteles. This statue had just been placed in the
middle of a small temple, which received light by
two opposite doors, in order that a gentle light might
fall on it on every side. But how may it be possible
to describe the surprise we felt at the first view, and
the illusions, which quickly followed! We lent our
feelings to the marble, and seemed to hear it sigh.
Two pupils of Praxiteles, who had lately arrived
from Athens to study this masterpiece, pointed out
to us the beauties, of which we felt the effect without
penetrating the cause. Among the by-standers,
one said,&mdash;'Venus has forsaken Olympus, and come
down to dwell among us.' Another said,&mdash;'If Juno
and Minerva should now behold her, they would no
more complain of the judgment of Paris:' and a
third exclaimed,&mdash;'The goddess formerly deigned to
exhibit her charms without a veil to Paris, Anchises,
and Adonis. Has she been seen by Praxiteles?'"</p>

<p>Mounting the rocks extending along the sea-shore,
Mr. Morritt came in view of the broken cliffs of the
Acropolis, and its ruined walls. The foundation and
lower courses of the city walls are still visible; these
extend from those of the Acropolis to the sea, and
have been strengthened by towers, now also in ruins.
He found also a building, the use of which he could
not understand. It was a plain wall of brown stone,
with a semicircle in the centre, and a terrace in front,
supported by a breast-work of masonry, facing the
sea. The walls were about ten or twelve feet in
height, solidly built of hewn stone, but without ornament.
There was anciently a theatre; the marble
seats of which still remain, although mixed with
bushes and overturned.  The arches and walls of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
the proscenium are now a heap of ruins on the
ground.</p>

<p>A large torso of a female figure with drapery, of
white marble, lies in the orchestra. It appears to
have been, originally, of good work; but is so mutilated
and corroded by the air, as now to be of little
or no consequence. Near this are foundations and
ruins of a magnificent Corinthian temple, also of
white marble; and several beautiful fragments of the
frieze, cornice, and capitals, lie scattered about; the
few bases of the peristyle remaining in their original
situation, so ruined, that it appears impossible to
ascertain the original form and proportion of the
building. In another part is seen a large temple,
also in ruins, and still more overgrown with bushes.
The frieze and cornice of this temple, which lie
amongst the rubbish, are of the highest and most
beautiful workmanship. A little to the north of
this stood a smaller temple, of grey veined marble,
whereof almost every vestige is obliterated.</p>

<p>Several arches of rough masonry, and a breast-work,
support a large square area, in which are the
remains of a long colonnade, of white marble, and of
the Doric order, the ruins of an ancient stoa. Of the
Acropolis nothing is left but a few walls of strong
brown stone<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>.</p>

<p>Besides these there are the remains of two aqueducts;
undistinguishable pieces of wall, some three,
some five, eight, ten feet from the ground; columns
plain, and fluted; a few small octagon altars, and
heaps of stones. Along the sea-shore lie pieces of
black marble<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>.</p>

<p>Whenever the ground is clear<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>, it is ploughed by
the peasantry around, who frequently stop here for
days together, in chambers of the ruins and caves of
the rocks. The Turks and Greeks have long resorted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
thither, as to a quarry, for the building materials
afforded by the remains.</p>

<p>The British consul at Rhodes states, that a fine
colossal statue of marble is still standing in the
centre of the orchestra belonging to the theatre, the
head of which the Turks have broken off; but he
remembers it when in a perfect state. Mr. Walpole
brought away the <i>torso</i> of a male statue, and which
has since been added to the collection of Greek
marbles at Cambridge<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="NO_XXXIX_HELIOPOLIS" id="NO_XXXIX_HELIOPOLIS"></a>NO. XXXIX.&mdash;HELIOPOLIS.</h2>


<p>This city was situated in that part of Egypt
which is called the Delta. It was named Heliopolis,
city of the sun, from the circumstance of there being
a temple dedicated to the sun there; and here, according
to historians, originated the tale in respect
to the ph&#339;nix.</p>

<p>At this place, Cambyses, king of Persia, committed
a very great extravagance; for he burned its temple,
demolished all the palaces, and destroyed most of the
monuments of antiquity that were then in it. Some
obelisks, however, escaped his fury, which are still
to be seen; others were transported to Rome.</p>

<p>In this city<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Sesostris built two obelisks of extreme
hard stone, brought from the quarries of
Syene, at the extremity of Egypt. They were
each 120 cubits high; that is, 30 fathoms, or 180
feet. The emperor Augustus, having made Egypt a
province of the Roman empire, caused these two
obelisks to be transplanted to Rome, one of which
was afterwards broken to pieces. He durst not
venture upon a third, which was of monstrous size.
It was made in the reign of Rameses; and it is said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
that 20,000 men were employed in the cutting of
it. Constantius, more daring than Augustus, ordered
it to be removed to Rome. Two of these obelisks
are still to be seen; as well as another of 100 cubits,
or 25 fathoms high, and 8 cubits, or 2 fathoms in
diameter. Caius C&aelig;sar had it taken from Egypt in
a ship of so odd a form, that, according to Pliny, the
like had never been seen.</p>

<p>At Heliopolis, there remains only a solitary
sphinx and an obelisk, to mark the site of the city of
the sun, where Moses, Herodotus, and Plato, are
said to have been instructed in the learning of the
Egyptians; whose learning and arts brought even
Greece for a pupil, and whose empire, says Bossuet,
in regard to Egypt in general, had a character distinct
from any other.</p>

<p>"This kingdom (says Rollin) bestowed its noblest
labours and finest arts on the improving of mankind;
and Greece was so sensible of this, that its most
illustrious men,&mdash;as Homer, Pythagoras, Plato,
even its great legislators, Lycurgus and Solon, with
many more,&mdash;travelled into Egypt to complete their
studies, and draw from that fountain whatever was
most rare and valuable in every kind of learning.
God himself has given this kingdom a glorious testimony,
when, praising Moses, he says of him, that
'he was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.'
Such was the desire for encouraging the growth of
scientific pursuits, that the discoverers of any useful
invention received rewards suitable to their skill and
labour. They studied natural history, geometry, and
astronomy, and what is worthy of remark, they were
so far masters of the latter science, as to be aware of
the period required for the earth's annual revolutions,
and fixed the year at 365 days 6 hours&mdash;a period
which remained unaltered till the very recent change
of the style. They likewise studied and improved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
the science of physic, in which they attained a certain
proficiency. The persevering ingenuity and industry
of the Egyptians are attested by the remains of their
great works of art, which could not well be surpassed
in modern times; and although their working
classes were doomed to engage in the occupations of
their fathers, and no others, as is still the custom in
India, society might thereby be hampered, but the
practice of handicrafts would be certainly improved.
The Egyptians were also the first people who were
acquainted with the process of communicating information
by means of writing, or engraving on stone
and metal; and were, consequently, the first who
formed books and collected libraries. These repositories
of learning they guarded with scrupulous care,
and the titles they bore, naturally inspired a desire to
enter them. They were called the "Office for the
Diseases of the Soul," and that very justly; because
the soul was there cured of ignorance, which, it will
be allowed, is the source of many of the maladies of
our mental faculties<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>."</p>

love to explore the vestiges of antiquity, and to dwell
in times that are no more. The first is the domain
of the imaginative affections alone; we can carry
none of our baser passions with us thither. The
antiquary is often spoken of as being of a peculiar
construction of intellect, which makes him think and
feel differently from other people. But, in truth,
the spirit of antiquarianism is one of the most universal
of human tendencies.  There is, perhaps,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
scarcely any person, for example, not utterly stupid
or sophisticated, who would not feel a strange thrill
come over him in the wonderful scenes these volumes
describe. Looking round upon the long ruined city,
who would not, for the moment, utterly forget the
seventeen centuries that had revolved since Herculaneum
and Pompeii were part and parcel of the
world, moving to and fro along its streets! It would
not be deemed a mere fever of curiosity that would
occupy the mind,&mdash;an impatience to pry into every
hole and corner of a scene at once so old and so new.
Besides all that, there would be a sense of the actual
presence of those past times, almost like the illusion
of a dream. There is, in fact, perhaps no spot
of interest on the globe, which would be found to
strike so deep an impression into so many minds."</p>

<p>Herculaneum is an ancient city of Italy, situated
in the Bay of Naples, and supposed to have been
founded by Hercules, or in honour of him, 1250
years before the Christian era.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> "This city," says
Strabo, "and its next neighbour, Pompeii, on the
river Sarnus, were originally held by the Osci, then
by the Tyrrhenians and Pelasgians, then by the
Samnites, who, in their turn, took possession of it,
and retained it ever after."</p>

<p>The adjacent country<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> was distinguished in all ages
for its romantic loveliness and beauty. The whole
coast, as far as Naples, was studded with villas, and
Vesuvius, whose fires had been long quiescent, was
itself covered with them. Villages were also scattered
along the shores, and the scene presented the
appearance of one vast city, cut into a number of
sections by the luxuriant vegetation of the paradise
in which it was embosomed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>The following epigram of Martial gives an animated
view of the scene, previous to the dreadful
catastrophe, which so blasted this fair page of Nature's
book:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
Here verdant vines o'erspread Vesuvius' sides;<br />

Here dancing satyrs joy'd to trip the green.<br />

And great Alcides once renown'd the place;<br />
Now flaming embers spread dire waste around,<br />
And gods regret that gods can so confound.<br />
</p>

<p>The scene of luxurious beauty<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> and tranquillity
above described was doomed to cease, and the subterranean
fire which had been from time immemorial
extinct in this quarter, again resumed its former
channel of escape. The long period of rest, which
had preceded this event, seems to have augmented
the energies of the volcano, and prepared it for the
terrible explosion. The first intimation of this was
the occurrence of an earthquake, in the year 63
after Christ, which threw down a considerable
portion of Pompeii, and also did great damage to
Herculaneum. In the year following, another severe
shock was felt, which extended to Naples, where
the Roman emperor Nero was at the time exhibiting
as a vocalist. The building in which he
performed was destroyed, but unfortunately the
musician had left it. These presages of the approaching
catastrophe were frequently repeated,
until, in <small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 79 (Aug. 24), they ended in the
great eruption. Fortunately we are in possession
of a narrative of the awful scene, by an eye-witness;&mdash;Pliny
the younger, who was at the time at
Misenum, with the Roman fleet, commanded by
his uncle, Pliny the elder. The latter, in order to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
obtain a nearer view of the phenomena, ventured
too far, and was suffocated by the vapours. His
nephew remained at Misenum, and describes the
appalling spectacle in a very lively manner.</p>

<p>"You ask me the particulars of my uncle's death,"
says he, in a letter to Tacitus, "in order to transmit it,
you say, with all its circumstances, to posterity. I
thank you for your intention. Undoubtedly the eternal
remembrance of a calamity, by which my uncle
perished with nations, promised immortality to his
name; undoubtedly his works also flattered him with
the same. But a line of Tacitus ensures it. Happy
the man to whom the gods have granted to perform
things worthy of being written, or to write what is
worthy of being read. Happier still is he who at
once obtains from them both these favours. Such
was my uncle's good fortune. I willingly therefore
obey your orders, which I should have solicited.
My uncle was at Misenum, where he commanded
the fleet. On the 23d of August, at one in the
afternoon, as he was on his bed, employed in studying,
after having, according to his custom, slept a
moment in the sun and drunk a glass of cold water,
my mother went up into his chamber. She informed
him that a cloud of an extraordinary shape and
magnitude was rising in the heavens. My uncle
got up and examined the prodigy; but without
being able to distinguish, on account of the distance,
that this cloud proceeded from Vesuvius. It resembled
a large pine-tree: it had its top and its branches.
It appeared sometimes white, sometimes black, and
at intervals of various colours, according as it was
more or less loaded with stones or cinders.</p>

<p>"My uncle was astonished; he thought such a
phenomenon worthy of a nearer examination. He
ordered a galley to be immediately made ready, and
invited me to follow him; but I rather chose to stay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
at home and continue my studies. My uncle therefore
departed alone.</p>

<p>"In the interim I continued at my studies. I
went to the bath; I lay down, but I could not sleep.
The earthquake, which for several days had repeatedly
shaken all the small towns, and even cities in
the neighbourhood, was increasing every moment.
I rose to go and awake my mother, and met her
hastily entering my apartment to awaken me.</p>

<p>"We descended into the court, and sat down there.
Not to lose time, I sent for my Livy. I read, meditated,
and made extracts, as I would have done in my
chamber. Was this firmness, or was it imprudence?
I know not now; but I was then very young!<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> At
the same instant one of my uncle's friends, just arrived
from Spain, came to visit him. He reproached my
mother with her security, and me with my audacity.
The houses, however, were shaking in so violent a
manner, that we resolved to quit Misenum. The
people followed us in consternation.</p>

<p>"As soon as we had got out of the town we stopped.
Here we found new prodigies and new terrors. The
shore, which was continually extending itself, and
covered with fishes left dry on it, was heaving every
moment, and repelling to a great distance the enraged
sea which fell back upon itself; whilst before us, from
the limits of the horizon, advanced a black cloud,
loaded with dull fires, which were incessantly rending
it, and darting forth large flashes of lightning.
The cloud descended and enveloped all the sea, it
was impossible any longer to discern either the isle
of Caprea, or the promontory of Misenum. 'Save
yourself, my dear son,' cried my mother; 'save yourself;
it is your duty; for you can, and you are young:
but as for me, bulky as I am, and enfeebled with
years, provided I am not the cause of thy death, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
die contented.'&mdash;'Mother, there is no safety for me
but with you.'&mdash;I took my mother by the hand, and
drew her along.&mdash;'O my son,' said she in tears, 'I
delay thy flight.'</p>

<p>"Already the ashes began to fall; I turned my
head; a thick cloud was rushing precipitately towards
us.&mdash;'Mother,' said I, 'let us quit the high road;
the crowd will stifle us in that darkness which is
pursuing us.' Scarcely had we left the high road
before it was night, the blackest night. Then
nothing was to be heard but the lamentations of
women, the groans of children, and the cries of men.
We could distinguish, through the confused sobs and
the various accents of grief, the words, <i>my father!</i>&mdash;<i>my
son!</i>&mdash;<i>my wife!</i>&mdash;there was no knowing each
other but by the voice. One was lamenting his
destiny; another the fate of his relations: some
were imploring the gods; others denying their existence;
many were invoking death to defend them
from death. Some said that they were now about
to be buried with the world, in that concluding night
which was to be eternal:&mdash;and amidst all this, what
dreadful reports! Fear exaggerated and believed
everything.</p>

<p>"In the mean time a glimmering penetrated the
darkness; this was the conflagration which was
approaching; but it stopped and extinguished; the
night grew more intensely dark, and the shower of
cinders and stones more thick and heavy. We
were obliged to rise from time to time to shake our
clothes. Shall I say it? Not a single complaint
escaped me. I consoled myself, amid the fears of
death, with the reflection that the world was about
to expire with me.</p>

<p>"At length this thick and black vapour gradually
vanished. The day revived, and even the sun appeared,
but dull and yellowish, such as he usually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
shows himself in an eclipse. What a spectacle now
offered itself to our yet troubled and uncertain eyes!
The whole country was buried beneath the ashes, as
in winter under the snow. The road was no longer
to be discerned. We sought for Misenum, and again
found it; we returned and took possession; for we
had in some measure abandoned it. Soon after, we
received news of my uncle. Alas! we had but too
good reason to be uneasy for him.</p>

<p>"I have told you, that, after quitting Misenum,
he went on board a galley. He directed his course
towards Retina, and the other towns which were
threatened. Every one was flying from it; he however
entered it, and, amidst the general confusion,
remarked all the phenomena, and dictated as he
observed. But already a cloud of burning ashes
beat down on his galley; already were stones falling
all around, and the shore covered with large
pieces of the mountain. My uncle hesitated whether
he should return from whence he came, or put out
to sea. <i>Fortune favours courage</i> (exclaimed he),
<i>let us turn towards Pomponianus</i>. Pomponianus
was at Stabi&aelig;. My uncle found him all trembling:
embraced and encouraged him, and to comfort him
by his security, asked for a bath, then sat down to
table and supped cheerfully; or, at least, which does
not show less fortitude, with all the appearance of
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>"In the mean time Vesuvius was taking fire on
every side, amid the thick darkness. 'It is the villages
which have been abandoned that are burning,'
said my uncle to the crowd about him, to endeavour
to quiet them. He then went to bed, and fell asleep.
He was in the profoundest sleep, when the court of
the house began to fill with cinders; and all the
passages were nearly closed up. They run to him;
and were obliged to awaken him. He rises, joins<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
Pomponianus, and deliberates with him and his
attendants what is best to be done, whether it
would be safest to remain in the house or fly into
the country. They chose the latter measure.</p>

<p>"They departed instantly therefore from the town,
and the only precaution they could take was to cover
their heads with pillows. The day was reviving
everywhere else; but there it continued night;
horrible night! the fire from the cloud alone enlightened
it. My uncle wished to gain the shore,
notwithstanding the sea was still tremendous. He
descended, drank some water, had a sheet spread, and
lay down on it. On a sudden, violent flames, preceded
by a sulphureous odour, shot forth with a
prodigious brightness, and made every one take to
flight. My uncle, supported by two slaves, arose;
but suddenly, suffocated by the vapour, he fell<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>,&mdash;and
Pliny was no more<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>."</p>

<p>If this visitation affected Misenum in so terrible
a manner, what must have been the situation of
the unfortunate inhabitants of Pompeii and Herculaneum,
so near its focus? The emperor Titus
here found an opportunity for the exercise of his
humanity. He hastened to the scene of affliction,
appointed curatores<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>, persons of consular dignity, to
set up the ruined buildings, and take charge of the
effects. He personally encouraged the desponding,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
and alleviated the misery of the sufferers; whilst a
calamity of an equally melancholy description recalled
him to Rome; where a most destructive fire, laying
waste nearly half the city, and raging three days
without interruption, was succeeded by a pestilence,
which for some time carried off ten thousand persons
every day!</p>

<p>Herculaneum and Pompeii rose again from their
ruins in the reign of Titus; and they still existed with
some remains of splendour under Hadrian<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>. The
beautiful characters of the inscription, traced out on
the base of the equestrian statue of Marcus Nonius
Balbus, son of Marcus, are an evident proof of its existence
at that period. They were found under the reign
of the Antonines. In the geographical monument,
known under the name of Peutinger's chart, which is of
a date posterior to the reign of Constantine, that is to
say in the commencement of the 4th century, Herculaneum
and Pompeii were still standing, and then
inhabited; but in the Itinerary, improperly ascribed
to Antoninus, neither of these two cities is noticed;
from which it may be conjectured, that their entire
ruin must have taken place in the interval between the
time when Peutinger's chart was constructed, and that
when the above Itinerary was composed.</p>

<p>The eruption, which took place in 471, occasioned
the most dreadful ravages. It is very probable that
the cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii disappeared at
that period, and that no more traces of them were left.</p>

<p>It appears, by the observation of Sir W. Hamilton<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>,
that the matter, which covers the ancient town of
Herculaneum, is not the produce of one eruption only;
but there are evident marks that the matter of six
eruptions has taken its course over that which lie immediately
above the town; and which was the cause
of its destruction. These strata are either of lava or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
burnt matter, with veins of good soil between them.
The stratum of erupted matter that immediately
covers the town, and with which the theatre and most
of the houses were filled, is not of that sort of vitrified
matter, called lava, but of a sort of soft stone composed
of pumice, ashes, and burnt matter. It is
exactly of the same nature with what is called the
Naples stone. The Italians call it tufa; and it is in
general use for building.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herculaneum</span> was covered with lava; Pompeii
with pumice stone; yet the houses of the latter were
built of lava; the product of former eruptions.</p>

<p>All memorials of the devoted cities were lost<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>;
and discussions, over the places they had once occupied,
were excited only by some obscure passages in
the classical authors. Six successive eruptions contributed
to lay them still deeper under the surface.
But after that period had elapsed, a peasant digging
a well beside his cottage in 1711, obtained some
fragments of coloured marble, which attracted attention.
Regular excavations were made, under the
superintendence of Stendardo, an architect of Naples;
and a statue of Hercules, of Greek workmanship,
and also a mutilated one of Cleopatra, were drawn
from what proved to be a temple in the centre of the
ancient Herculaneum.</p>

<p>It may be well conceived with what interest the
intelligence was received, that a Roman city had
been discovered, which, safely entombed under-ground,
had thus escaped the barbarian Goths and
Vandals, who ravaged Italy, or the sacrilegious
hands of modern pillagers.</p>

<p>The remains of several public buildings have been
discovered<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>, which have possibly suffered from subsequent
convulsions. Among these are two temples;
one of them one hundred and fifty feet by sixty, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
which was found a statue of Jupiter. A more extensive
edifice stood opposite to them; forming a
rectangle of two hundred and twenty-eight feet by
one hundred and thirty-two, supposed to have been
appropriated for the courts of justice. The arches
of a portico surrounding it were supported by columns;
within, it was paved with marble; the walls were
painted in fresco; and bronze statues stood between
forty columns under the roof. A theatre was found
nearly entire; very little had been displaced; and
we see in it one of the best specimens extant of the
architecture of the ancients. The greatest diameter
of the theatre is two hundred and thirty-four feet,
whence it is computed, that it could contain ten
thousand persons, which proves the great population
of the city.</p>

<p>This theatre was rich in antiquities<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>, independent
of the ornamental part. Statues, occupying niches,
represented the Muses; scenic masks were imitated
on the entablatures; and inscriptions were engraven
on different places. Analogous to the last were
several large alphabetical Roman characters in bronze;
and a number of smaller size, which had probably
been connected in some conspicuous situation. A
metallic car was found, with four bronze horses attached
to it, nearly of the natural size; but all in such a
state of decay, that only one, and the spokes of the
wheels, also in metal, could be preserved. A beautiful
white marble statue of Venus, only eighteen
inches high, in the same attitude as the famous
Venus de Medicis, was recovered; and either here,
or in the immediate vicinity, was found a colossal
bronze statue of Vespasian, filled with lead, which
twelve men were unable to move.</p>

<p>Besides many objects entire, there were numerous
fragments of others, extremely interesting; which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
had been originally impaired, or were injured by
attempts to remove them.</p>

<p>When we reflect, that sixteen hundred years have
elapsed since the destruction of this city<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>, an interval
which has been marked by numerous revolutions,
both in the political and mental state of Europe, a
high degree of interest must be experienced in contemplating
the venerable remains, recovered from the
subterraneous city of Herculaneum. Pliny, the
younger, in his letters, brings the Romans, their
occupations, manners, and customs, before us. He
pictures in feeling terms the death of his uncle, who
perished in the same eruption as the city we now
describe; and that event is brought to our immediate
notice by those very things which it was the means
of preserving. Among these we see the various
articles which administered to the necessities and
the pleasures of the inhabitants, the emblems of their
religious sentiments, and the very manners and customs
of domestic life.</p>

<p>These curiosities consist not only of statues, busts,
altars, inscriptions, and other ornamental appendages
of Grecian opulence and luxury; but also comprehend
an entire assortment of the domestic, musical,
and surgical instruments; tripods of elegant form
and exquisite execution; lamps in endless variety;
vases and basins of noble dimensions; chandeliers of
the most beautiful shapes, looking-glasses of polished
metal; coloured glass, so hard, clear, and well stained,
as to appear like emeralds, sapphires, and other precious
stones; a kitchen completely fitted up with
copper pans lined with silver, kettles, cisterns for
heating water, and every utensil necessary for culinary
purposes; also specimens of various sorts of
combustibles, retaining their form though burnt to a
cinder. By an inscription, too, we learn that Her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>culaneum
contained no less than nine hundred houses
of entertainment, such as we call taverns. Articles
of glass, artificial gems, vases, tripods, candelabra,
lamps, urns, dice, and dice-boxes; various articles
of dress and ornaments; surgical instruments, weights
and measures, carpenters' and masons' tools; but no
musical instruments except the sistrum, cymbals, and
flutes of bone and ivory.</p>

<p>Fragments of columns of various coloured marble
and beautiful mosaic pavements were also found disseminated
among the ruins; and numerous sacrificial
implements, such as pater&aelig;, tripods, cups, and vases,
were recovered in excellent preservation, and even
some of the knives with which the victims are conjectured
to have been slaughtered.</p>

<p>The ancient pictures of Herculaneum<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> are of the
utmost interest; not only from the freshness and
colour, but from the nature of the subjects they
represent. All are executed in fresco; they are
exclusively on the walls, and generally on a black or
red ground. Some are of animated beings large as
life; but the majority are in miniature. Every different
subject of antiquity is depicted here; deities,
human figures, animals, landscapes, foreign and domestic,
and a variety of grotesque beings; sports and
pastimes, theatrical performances, sacrifices, all enter
the catalogue.</p>

<p>In regard to the statues found<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>, some are colossal,
some of the natural size, and some in miniature;
and the materials of their formation are either clay,
marble, or bronze. They represent all different objects,
divinities, heroes, or distinguished persons;
and in the same substances, especially bronze, there
are the figures of many animals.</p>

<p>It is not probable that the best paintings of ancient
Greece and Italy<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> were deposited in Herculaneum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
or Pompeii, which were towns of the second order,
and unlikely to possess the master-pieces of the chief
artists, which were usually destined to adorn the
more celebrated temples or the palaces of kings and
emperors. Their best statues are correct in their
proportions, and elegant in their forms; but their
paintings are not correct in their proportions, and are,
comparatively, inelegant in their forms.</p>

<p>A few rare medals also have been found among these
ruins, the most curious of which is a gold medallion
of Augustus, struck in Sicily in the fifteenth year of
his reign.</p>

<p>Nor must we omit one of the greatest curiosities,
preserved at Portici<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>. This consists of a cement of
cinders, which in one of the eruptions of Vesuvius
surprised a woman, and totally enveloped her. This
cement, compressed and hardened by time around her
body, has become a complete mould of it, and in the
pieces here preserved, we see a perfect impression of
the different parts to which it adhered. One represents
half a bosom, which is of exquisite beauty;
another a shoulder, a third a portion of her shape,
and all concur in revealing to us that this woman
was young; that she was tall and well made, and
even that she had escaped in her chemise, for some of
the linen was still adhering to the ashes.</p>

<p>Though the city was destroyed<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> in the manner we
have related, remarkably few skeletons have been
found, though many were discovered in the streets of
Pompeii; but one appears under the threshold of a
door with a bag of money in his hand, as if in the
attitude of escaping, leaving its impression in the
surrounding volcanic matter.</p>

<p>These and other valuable antiquities are preserved
in the museum at Portici, which occupies the site of
ancient Herculaneum, and in the Museo Borbonico at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
Naples. For details in respect to which, we must
refer to the numerous books that have described
them.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting departments of this
unique collection is that of the Papyri, or MSS.,
discovered in the excavation of Herculaneum. The
ancients did not bind their books (which, of course,
were all MSS.) like us, but rolled them up in scrolls.
When those of Herculaneum were discovered, they
presented, as they still do, the appearance of burnt
bricks, or cylindrical pieces of charcoal, which they
had acquired from the action of the heat contained in
the lava, that buried the whole city. They seemed
quite solid to the eye and touch; yet an ingenious
monk discovered a process of detaching leaf from
leaf, and unrolling them, by which they could be
read without much difficulty. It is, nevertheless, to
be regretted, that so little success has followed the
labours of those who have attempted to unrol them.
Some portions, however, have been unrolled, and
the titles of about 400 of the least injured have been
read. They are, for the most part, of little importance;
but all entirely new, and chiefly relating to
music, rhetoric, and cookery. The obliterations and
corrections are numerous, so that there is a probability
of their being original manuscripts. There
are two volumes of Epicurus "on Virtue," and the
rest are, for the most part, productions of the same
school of writers. Only a very few are written in
Latin, almost all being in Greek. All were found
in the library of one individual, and in a quarter of
the town where there was the least probability of
finding anything of the kind.</p>

<p>The following is a list of the most important
works that have been discovered:&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="NO_XXXVIII_HIERAPOLIS" id="NO_XXXVIII_HIERAPOLIS"></a>NO. XXXVIII.&mdash;HIERAPOLIS.</h2>


<p>This was a town in Syria, near the Euphrates,
deriving its name from the number of its temples<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>.
It abounded in hot springs; and those gave origin to
the following fable: "The shepherd poet relates,
after mentioning a case in Phrygia, sacred to the
nymphs, that near these springs Luna had once descended
from the sky to Endymion, while he was
sleeping by the herds; that marks of their bed were
then extant under the oaks; and in the thickets
around it the milk of cows had been spilt, which
man still beheld with admiration (for such was the
appearance if you saw it afar off); but that from
thence flowed clear and warm water, which in a little
time concreted round the channel, and formed a stone
pavement."</p>

<p>The deity most worshipped in ancient times in
this city, and indeed throughout all Ph&#339;nicia, was
the goddess Astarte, called in Scripture the Queen of
Heaven and the goddess of the Sidonians.</p>

<p>Dr. Chandler and his friend Mr. Revett ascended
to the ruins, which are in a flat, passing by sepulchres
with inscriptions, and entering from the east. They
had soon the theatre on the right hand; and opposite
to it, near the margin of the cliff, are the remains of an
ancient structure, once perhaps baths, or as was conjectured,
a gymnasium; the huge vaults of the roof
striking horror as they rode underneath. Beyond is
the mean ruin of a modern fortress; and farther on
are massive walls of edifices, several of them leaning
from their perpendicular, the stones disjointed, and
seeming every moment ready to fall&mdash;the effects and
evidences of repeated earthquakes.</p>

<p>In a recess of the mountain, on the right side, is
the area of a stadium. Then again sepulchres succeed;
some nearly buried in the mountain side, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
one, a square building, with an inscription with large
letters.</p>

<p>The theatre appears to have been a very large and
sumptuous structure: part of the front is still standing.
In the heap, which lies in confusion, are many
sculptures, well executed in basso-relievo, with pieces
of architecture inscribed, but disjoined, or so incumbered
with massive marbles, that no information
could be gathered from them. The character is large
and bold, with ligatures. The marble seats are still
unremoved. The numerous ranges are divided by a
low semicircular wall, near the midway, with inscriptions,
on one of which Apollo Archegetes (or
the Leader) is requested to be propitious. In another
compartment, mention is made of the city by its
name; and a third is an encomium, in verse. "Hail,
golden city, Hierapolis, the spot to be preferred before
any in wide Asia; revered for the rills of the
nymphs; adorned with splendour." In some of the
inscriptions the people are styled "the most splendid,"
and the senate "the most powerful."</p>

<p>Hierapolis was not so magnificent as Laodicea; but
still it was a splendid place; and, like its neighbour
city, is now almost "an utter desolation<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>."</p>

<p>"<i>In the territory of Istakhar is a great building,
with statues carved in stone; and there, also, are inscriptions
and paintings. It was said that this was a

are in Syria, and Baalbeck, and in Egypt.</i>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ebn
Hawkel; Ouseley.</span></p>

<p>The origin of Isfahan is not to be traced with any
certainty. It is, however, for the most part, supposed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
to have arisen from the ruins of Hecatompylos,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> the
capital of Parthia. This city was the royal residence
of Arsaces, and it was situated at the springs of the
Araxes. Whatever may have been the origin of this
city, it is universally admitted that the situation of
it, topographically, and centrically with regard to the
empire, is admirably adapted for a royal residence and
capital<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>. It stands on the river Zeinderood; and
has been celebrated as a city of consequence from the
time in which it was first noted in history<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>; and that
is, we believe, at the period in which it was taken
possession of by Ardisheer, who, soon after, was proclaimed
king of Persia; and was considered by his
countrymen as the restorer of that great empire,
which had been created by Cyrus and lost by Darius.</p>

<p>This prince was so great a sovereign, that it gives
pleasure to note some of his sayings:&mdash;"When
a king is just, his subjects must love him, and continue
obedient: but the worst of all sovereigns is he whom
the wealthy, and not the wicked, fear." "There
can be no power without an army; no army without
money; no money without agriculture; no agriculture
without justice." "A furious lion is better than
an unjust king: but an unjust king is not so bad as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
a long and unjust war." "Never forget," said he, on
his death-bed, to his son, "that, as a king, you are
at once the protector of religion and of your country.
Consider the altar and throne as inseparable; they
must always sustain each other. A sovereign without
religion is a tyrant; and a people who have none
may be deemed the most monstrous of all societies.
Religion may exist without a state; but a state
cannot exist without religion; and it is by holy laws
that a political association can alone be bound. You
should be to your people an example of piety and of
virtue, but without pride or ostentation." After a
few similar lessons, he concluded in the following
manner:&mdash;"Remember, my son, that it is the prosperity
or adversity of the ruler, which forms the
happiness or misery of his subjects; and that the
fate of the nation depends upon the conduct of the
individual who fills the throne. The world is exposed
to constant vicissitudes: learn, therefore, to meet the
frowns of Fortune with courage and fortitude, and
to receive her smiles with moderation and wisdom.
To sum up all:&mdash;May your administration be such as
to bring, at a future day, the blessings of those whom
God has confided to our paternal care, upon both your
memory and mine."</p>

<p><small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 1387, Isfahan surrendered to Timour. The
moment he pitched his camp before it, it yielded.
Satisfied with this ready submission, Timour commanded
that the town should be spared, but that
a heavy contribution should be levied on the inhabitants.
This had been almost entirely collected, when
a young blacksmith, one under age, beat a small drum
for his amusement. A number of citizens, mistaking
this for an alarm, assembled, and became so irritated
from a communication to each other of the distress
they suffered, that they began an attack upon those
whom they considered the immediate cause of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
misery; and, before morning, nearly 3000 of the
Tartars, who had been quartered in the city, were
slain. The rage of Timour, when he heard of this,
exceeded all bounds. He would therefore listen to
no terms of capitulation. He doomed Isfahan to be
an example to all other cities. The unfortunate
inhabitants knew what they had to expect, and made
all the resistance they could; but in vain. The walls
were carried by storm; and the cruel victor did not
merely permit pillage and slaughter, but commanded
that every soldier should bring him a certain number
of heads. Some of those, more humane than their
master, purchased the number allotted, rather than
become the executioners of unresisting men. It was
found impossible to compute all the slain; but an
account was taken of 70,000 heads, which were
heaped in pyramids that were raised in monuments
of this horrid revenge.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>Isfahan attained its highest pitch and magnitude
in the time of Shah Abbas. It became the great
emporium of the Asiatic world; and during his reign
nearly a million of people animated its streets, and
the equally flourishing peasantry of more than 1400
villages in its neighbourhood, supplied by their labour
the markets of this abundant population.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Industry,
diligence, activity, and negotiations, were seen and
heard everywhere. The caravans even were crowded
with merchants, and the shops with the merchandise
of Europe and Asia; while the court of the great
Shah was the resort of ambassadors from the proudest
kingdoms, not only of the East but of the West.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
Travellers thronged thither from every part, not only
on affairs of business, but to behold the splendour of
the place.</p>

<p>In fact, it owes most of the glory it now possesses
to Shah Abbas, who, after the conquest of Lar and
Ormus, charmed with its situation, made it the
capital of his empire between 1620 and 1628; for
the fertility of the soil, the mildness of the seasons,
and the fine temperature of the air, conspire, it is
said, to make Isfahan one of the most delightful cities
in the world. The waters of its two rivers, also,
are so sweet, pleasant, and wholesome, as to be almost
beyond comparison.</p>

<p>The splendours of Isfahan are described by Pietro
Della Velle<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> and Chardin.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> What they were would
occupy too large a space; but we may judge of the
extent and nature of the public works by the causeway<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
this prince formed across the whole of Mazenderen,
so as to render that difficult country passable
for armies and travellers at all seasons of the year.
He threw bridges over almost all the rivers of Persia.
He studied, we are told, beyond all former sovereigns,
the general welfare and improvement of his kingdom.
He fixed on the city of Ispahan as the capital of his
dominions; and its population was more than doubled
during his reign. Its principal mosque, the noble
palace of Chehel-Setoon, the beautiful avenues and
porticoes called Ch&acirc;r Bagh, and several of the finest
palaces in the city and suburbs, were all built by this
prince.</p>

<p>In 1721 there was a great rebellion. A celebrated
traveller, who was on the spot, assures us, that the
inhabitants of one of the suburbs (Julfa, an Arme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>nian
colony), not many years before, amounted to
thirty thousand souls. He says, that some of the
streets were broad and handsome, and planted with
trees, with canals, and fountains in the middle;
others narrow and crooked, and arched at top; others
again, though extremely narrow, as well as turning
and winding many ways, were of an incredible
length, and resembled so many labyrinths; that at
a small distance from the town there were public
walks adorned with plane-trees on either hand, and
ways paved with stones, fountains and cisterns: that
there were one hundred caravanserais for the use of
merchants and travellers, many of which were built
by the kings and prime nobility of Persia. He goes
on to state, that there was a castle in the eastern
part of the town, which the citizens looked upon as
impregnable, in which the public money and most of
the military stores were kept: but that, notwithstanding
the number of baths and caravanserais were
almost innumerable, there was not one public hospital.
All this was in the suburb of Julfa only. In
what condition is that suburb now?</p>

<p><small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 1722, Mahmoud, chief of the Afghans, invaded
Persia, and laid siege to Isfahan. He was at
first repulsed and compelled to fall back; in consequence
of which he made overtures. These the
citizens unfortunately rejected. Mahmoud, in consequence,
determined on laying waste the whole of
the neighbouring country. Now the districts surrounding
Ispahan were, perhaps, the most fruitful in
the world, and art had done her utmost to assist
nature in adorning this delightful country. This
fairest of regions was doomed by Mahmoud to complete
ruin! The task occupied his army more than
a month; but the lapse of nearly a century has not
repaired what their barbarity effected in that period;
and the fragments of broken canals, sterile fields, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
mounds of ruins, still mark the road with which
they laboured in the work of destruction.</p>

<p>A famine ensued in consequence of this, and the
inhabitants of Isfahan were reduced to despair. The
flesh of horses, camels, and mules, became so dear<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>,
that none but the king, some of the nobles, and the
wealthiest citizens, could afford to purchase. Though
the Persians abhor dogs as unclean, they ate greedily
of them, as well as of other forbidden animals.
When these supplies were exhausted, they
fed not only upon the leaves and bark of trees,
but on leather, which they softened by boiling;
and when this was exhausted too, they began to
devour human flesh. Men, we are told, with their
eyes sunk, their countenances livid, and their bodies
feeble and emaciated with hunger, were seen in
crowds, endeavouring to protract a wretched existence
by cutting pieces from the bodies of those
who had just expired. In many instances the
citizens slew each other, and parents murdered their
children to furnish the horrid meal. Some, more
virtuous, poisoned themselves and families, that they
might escape the guilt of preserving life by such
means. The streets, the squares, and even the royal
gardens, were covered with carcases; and the river
Zainderand, which flowed through the city, became
so corrupted by dead bodies<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>, that it was hardly
possible to drink of its waters<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>. Overpowered with
his misfortunes, Shah Husseyn abdicated his throne
in favour of his persecutor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>

<p>These events are related in Bucke's Harmonies of
Nature, thus:&mdash;During the reign of Shah Husseyn,
Isfahan was besieged by Mahmoud, chief of
the Afghans; when the besieged, having consumed
their horses, mules, camels, the leaves and bark of
trees, and even cloth and leather, finished,&mdash;so great
was the famine,&mdash;with not only eating their neighbours
and fellow-citizens, but their very babes.
During this siege more human beings were devoured
than was ever known in a siege before. Mahmoud
having at length listened to terms of capitulation,
Husseyn clad himself in mourning; and with the
Wali of Arabia, and other officers of his court, proceeded
to the camp of his adversary, and resigned the
empire. The Afghan chief, in receiving his resignation,
exclaimed, "Such is the instability of all
human grandeur! God disposes of empires, as he
pleases, and takes them from one to give to another!"
This occurred in the year 1716.</p>

<p>Mahmoud was now king of Persia. But, some
time after, fearing a revolt of the people of Isfahan,
he invited all the nobles of the city to a feast, and
the moment they arrived, a signal was given, and
they were all massacred. Their amount was three
thousand! not so many as one escaped. Their bodies
were exposed in the streets, that the inhabitants
might behold and tremble. But an equal tragedy
was yet to be performed. He had taken three
thousand of the late king's guards into his pay.
These men he directed to be peculiarly well treated;
and, as a mark of favour, he commanded that a
dinner should be dressed for them in one of the
squares of the palace. The men came; sat down;
and the moment they had done so, a party of the
tyrant's troops fell upon them, and not a single soul
was allowed to escape!</p>

<p>This, however, was not the close of things, but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
beginning. A general order was now issued, to put
every Persian to death, who had in any way served
the former government. The massacre lasted 15 days!
Those who survived were made to leave the city,
with the sole exception of a small number of male
youths, whom the tyrant proposed to train in the
habits and usages of his own nation.</p>

<p>Nor does this terminate the history of his atrocities.
He soon after massacred all the males of the royal
family. These victims he caused to be assembled in
one of the courts of the palace; when attended by
two or three favourites, he commenced, with his own
sabre, the horrid massacre. Thirty-nine princes of
the blood were murdered on this dreadful occasion.
The day of punishment, however, was at hand. He
soon after died in a state of horrific insanity! His
body was buried in a royal sepulchre; but when
Nadir Shah afterwards took Isfahan, he caused it to
be taken from the sepulchre and abandoned to the
fury of the populace; and the place where he had
been interred was converted into a common sewer to
receive the filth of the city. This was in the year
1727.</p>

<p>Isfahan never recovered these dreadful events.
Mr. Hanway tells us, that in the time he visited it, a
Persian merchant assured him, that in all Isfahan
there were not more than five thousand inhabited
houses. It has been, since, several times taken and
retaken by tyrants and revolters. It was last taken
by Aga Mohamed Khan (<small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 1785); who dismantled
the walls.</p>

<p>Its present condition is thus described by Sir
Robert Ker Porter:&mdash;"The streets are everywhere in
ruin; the bazaars silent and abandoned; the caravanserais
are equally forsaken; its thousand villages
hardly now counting two hundred; its palaces solitary
and forlorn; and the nocturnal laugh and song, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
used to echo from every part of the gardens, succeeded
by the yells of jackals and shouts of famishing
dogs."</p>

<p>Sir Robert afterwards gives an account of the ruins.
From one end of the city to the other, under avenues
old and new, through the gardens, and round their
delightful "paradises," of shade and fountain, he
hardly saw a single creature moving. If, says he,
"Isfahan continues fifty years so totally abandoned of
its sovereign's notice as it is now, Isfahan will become
a total ruin, amidst the saddest of wildernesses."</p>

<p>The name of this city is said to have been Sepahan,
which it received from the Persian kings, in consequence
of its having been the general place of rendezvous
for their armies. "This famous city," says
Mr. Kinneir<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>, "has been so minutely described, even
when at the height of its glory, by many travellers,
and particularly by Chardin, that it will only be
necessary to state the changes that have taken place
since the period in which he wrote. The wall, which
then surrounded the city, was entirely destroyed by
the Afghans, who have left many striking marks of
their savage and barbarous habits in every part of
the kingdom. The suburb of Julfa has been reduced
from twelve thousand to six hundred families;
most of the others have shared the same fate; and a
person may ride ten miles amidst the ruins of this
immense capital. The spacious houses and palaces,
which opened to the Royal Avenue, are almost all
destroyed. The first view, however," continues Mr.
Kinneir, "which the traveller has, on coming from
Shirauz, of this great metropolis, is from an eminence,
about five miles from the city, when it bursts
at once upon his sight, and is, perhaps, one of the
grandest prospects in the universe. Its ruinous condition
is not observable at a distance; all defects being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
hid by high trees and lofty buildings; and palaces,
colleges, mosques, minarets, and shady groves, are the
only objects that meet the eye."</p>

<p>The bazaars, constructed by Shah Abbas, which
were covered in with vaults, and lighted by numerous
domes, are of prodigious extent, and proclaim the
former magnificence of the city. They extend considerably
more than a mile.</p>

<p>The palaces of the king are enclosed in a fort of
lofty walls, which have a circumference of three miles.
The palace of the Chehel Sitoon, or "forty pillars,"
is situated in the middle of an immense square, which
is intersected by various canals, and planted in different
directions with the beautiful chenar tree. The
palace was built by Shah Abbas. Under the great
room are summer apartments, excavated in the
ground, which, in their season, must be delightful
retreats. They are also wainscoted, and paved with
marble slabs; and water is introduced by cascades,
which fall from the ground floor, and refresh the whole
range. The Ali Capi gate forms the entrance. This
gate, once the scene of the magnificence of the Seffi
family, the threshold of which was ever revered as
sacred, is now deserted, and only now and then a
solitary individual is seen to pass negligently through.
The remains of that splendour, so minutely and
exactly described by Chardin, are still to be traced;
the fine marble remains, and the grandeur and elevation
of the dome, are still undemolished.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> At the Ala
Capi gate of the old palaces, which is described as
one of the most perfect pieces of brick-work to be
found in Persia, used to sit Shah Abbas, and thence
review his cavalry, galloping and skirmishing, or

times this view from the spot was undoubtedly splendid;
but, at present, with the exception of the palaces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
in the gardens, the whole mass below is one mouldering
succession of ruinous houses, mosques, and shapeless
structures, which had formerly been the mansions of
the nobility, broken by groups or lines of various tall
trees, which once made part of the gardens of the
houses now in ruins. The freshness of all the buildings
is said to be particularly striking to an European,
or the inhabitants of any comparatively humid country,
in which the atmosphere cherishes a vegetation
of mosses, lichens, and other cryptogamous plants,
which we particularly associate in our minds with
the spectacle of decay.</p>

<p>Sir W. Ouseley says, "I explored the ruins of
villages, scattered over the plain in all directions near
our camp; and some must have been considerable in
size and respectability from the handsome houses
which they contained. Although pillaged and depopulated
by the Afghans almost a century ago, many
of their chambers yet remain, with vaults and staircases
but little injured; yet no human being is ever
seen within their walls, except some traveller, who
wonders at finding himself alone in places, which
might be easily rendered habitable, situate not above
a mile from the walls of a great metropolis. It must
be confessed, that these ruins, composed of sun-dried
brick and mud, appear, like many edifices in Persia,
to much greater advantage on paper than in reality."</p>

<p>Morier, in his second journey into Persia, says:&mdash;"The
great city of Isfahan, which Chardin has described,
is twenty-four miles in circumference, were it
to be weeded (if the expression may be used) of its
ruins, would now dwindle to a quarter that circumference.
One might suppose that God's curse had
extended over part of this city, as it did over
Babylon. Houses, bazaars, mosques, palaces, whole
streets, are to be seen in total abandonment; and I
have rode for miles among its ruins without meeting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
with any living creature, except, perhaps, a jackal
peeping over a wall, or a fox running to its hole.</p>

<p>"In a large tract of ruins," Mr. Morier goes on to
observe, "where houses, in different stages of decay,
were to be seen, now and then an inhabited house
may be discovered, the owner of which may be assimilated
to Job's forlorn man, '<i>dwelling in desolate
cities, and which no man inhabiteth, which are ready
to become heaps</i><a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>.' Such a remark as this must have
arisen from scenery similar to those which parts of
Isfahan present; and unless the particular feeling of
melancholy which they inspire has been felt, no
words can convey any idea of it<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>."</p>

<p>This city (in Spain) is supposed to have been
founded by the Ph&#339;nicians, who give it the name of
Hispalis. It was afterwards colonized by the wounded
soldiers of Scipio. It was then called Julia, and at
last, after a variety of corruptions, Sebilla or Sevilla,
la Viega.</p>

<p>The Romans embellished it with many magnificent
edifices, but of which scarcely any vestige now
remains.</p>

<p>In regard to the new city, the Gothic kings for
some time made it their residence; but it was taken
by storm soon after the victory obtained at Xeres,
over the Gothic king Rodrigo. It at last fell before
Ferdinand III., after a year's siege; and three hundred
thousand Moors were compelled to quit the
place; notwithstanding which it became the most
magnificent city in all Spain, a little after the discovery
of America; all the valuable commodities of the
West Indies being carried thither.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<p>An old Spanish writer thus speaks of this place:&mdash;"Not
far from hence one sees the <i>ruins of an
ancient city</i>; and of an amphitheatre, great part of
which remains; but many of the great parts lie in
such confusion, as if it had been thrown into disorder
by an earthquake. The people call this place Sevilla
la Vieja, or Old Seville; but the learned take it to
be the ancient Italica, the birth-place of the emperor
Adrian and Silius Italicus; there having been found
a sufficient number of ancient medals and inscriptions
to justify that opinion; and amongst others, they
found a medal of Tiberius, with the following legend
upon it: DIVI. AVG. MVNIC. ITALIC. PERM.
And in the time of Fernando el Santo, the conqueror
of Seville (which was in the year 1248), this place
retained some traces of its ancient name; for it was
called Talca. Some of the ruins appear to have
been the remains of a temple, and a bath. In the
spot near which many of these ruins are to be seen,
there is a monastery of St. Isidore; and in the church
there is an altar of alabaster, which can scarce be
matched in Europe<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>."</p>

<p>"In the whole universe," says Mr. Eustace,
"there were only two cities interesting alike to every
member of the great Christian commonwealth, to
every citizen of the civilised world, whatever may be
his tribe or nation&mdash;Rome and Jerusalem. The
former calls up every classic recollection; the lat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>ter
awakens every sentiment of devotion; the one

<p>Palestine, or the land of Canaan, originally extended
in length from north to south, near two hundred
miles, and from eighty to fifteen in breadth,
from east to west. Its southern boundary was formed
by the desert of Beersheba, the Dead Sea, the river
Arnon, and the river of Egypt, or the Siehor; to the
north, it was bounded by the mountainous ridge
called Antilibanus; to the east by Arabia, and to the
west by the Mediterranean. Though rocky and
mountainous, it was one of the most fertile provinces
of the temperate zone; a land, according to the
authority of the sacred penman, of brooks of waters,
of fountains, and depths, that spring out of valleys
and hills; a land of wheat, and barley, and vines,
and fig-trees, and pomegranates; a land of olive-oil,
and honey; a land wherein bread might be eaten
without scarceness, whose stones were iron, and out
of whose hills might be dug brass.</p>

<p>In the midst of this highly favoured region stood
the city of Jerusalem, which, according to the Jewish
chronology, was founded by their high priest Melchizedec,
in the year of the world 2032. It was
then called Salem, a word signifying <i>peace</i>.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>

<p>Joshua is supposed to have destroyed Jerusalem;
that town, though not mentioned, being considered
to have been one of those that fought against Gibeon,
the king of which was Adoni-zedek<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>.</p>

<p>The city was afterwards rebuilt by David, and
surrounded with fortifications, extending inwards
from the low grounds, called Millo, to the summit of
the mountain, on which he erected a citadel, destined
alike to be the great fortress of the nation, and the
sumptuous residence of its kings. The rich work of
the tabernacle, and the splendour which characterised
many of their ceremonies, had long tended to inspire
the Israelites with a taste for the elegant arts. David's
palace, we accordingly find, was a palace of cedar.
In raising this structure, the timber of Tyre and the
superior skill of its artificers were employed to
secure its beauty and stability. When completed,
the grace and majesty of the pile reminded the monarch
that, in taking up his abode in such a building,
he should be more splendidly lodged than the
ark and visible emblem of Jehovah itself. With this
idea in his mind, he resolved upon erecting a building
for the service of God, which should be as worthy
of its destination as the ability and piety of man
could make it.</p>

<p>This design, David not living to carry into execution,
was followed up and completed by Solomon his
son. From the reign of Solomon to the final destruction
of the city, it underwent many vicissitudes,
some of which we shall recite. In the fourth year
of Solomon's son, Rehoboam (<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 971), it was besieged
and taken by Sesac, king of Egypt, who car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>ried
away the treasures of the temple, as well as
those of the royal palace.</p>

<p>In 826 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> the temple and palace were plundered
by Jehoash, and the walls demolished. In 608 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
Jerusalem was taken by Nechao, king of Egypt.
It was next besieged by Sennacherib, king of Nineveh.
That prince having returned from Egypt, which he
had ravaged, and taken a great number of prisoners,
laid siege to it with a vast army. The city appeared
to be inevitably lost: it was without resource, and
without hope from the hands of men. It had, however,
says the historian, "a powerful protector in
Heaven, whose jealous ears had heard the impious
blasphemies uttered by the king of Nineveh against
his sacred name. In one single night 185,000 men
of his army perished by the sword of the destroying
angel."</p>

<p>Jerusalem was soon after besieged by Nebuchadonosser
and taken; when the conqueror caused
Jehoiakim to be put in chains with the design of
having him carried to Babylon; but, being moved
with his affliction, he restored him to his throne. Great
numbers, however, of the Jews were carried captives
to Babylon, whither all the treasures of the king's
palace and a part of the temple were likewise transported.
From this famous epoch we are to date the
captivity of the Jews at Babylon.</p>

<p>They having afterwards rebelled, the king came
from Babylon and besieged them anew. The siege
lasted nearly a year. At length the city was taken
by storm, and a terrible slaughter ensued. Zedekiah's
two sons were, by Nebuchadnezzar's orders,
killed before their father's face, with all the noblemen
and principal men of Judah. Zedekiah himself had
both his eyes put out, was loaded with fetters, and
carried to Babylon, where he was confined in prison
as long as he lived. As to the city and temple, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
were both pillaged and burned, and all their fortifications
demolished.</p>

<p>The kings of Persia soon after permitted the
Jews to rebuild the temple;<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> but not the walls.
Artaxerxes Epiphanes, however, issued an edict that
they might rebuild their walls; and Nehemiah, as
governor of Judea, was appointed to put this edict
in execution; and, in order to do him higher honour,
the king ordered a body of horse to escort him
thither. He likewise wrote to all the governors of
the provinces on this side the Euphrates, to give him
all the assistance possible in forwarding the work for
which he was sent. This pious Jew did not fail to
execute every part of his commission with great
activity and zeal.</p>

<p>After the time of Nehemiah, Jerusalem enjoyed
peace till the year <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 332, when Alexander, having
taken Tyre, demanded assistance of the Jews, and
being refused by the high-priest, who pleaded an
oath, made to Darius, not to take part with his
enemies; the Macedonian was incensed, and repairing
to Jerusalem, determined to be avenged on the
city and its inhabitants; but being met by a multitude
of people, dressed in white, the priests arrayed in
their robes, and the high priest in a garment of purple
and gold, having on his head a tiara, on which was
inscribed the name of the Lord, his passion subsided;
and, approaching the high-priest, he offered his adoration
to God, and saluted all the Hebrews.</p>

<p>We pass over Alexander's entry into the city, be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>cause
enough will be said of that vain-glorious person,
in other pages of our work; also the siege which
Ptolemy made it sustain, to the time when Antiochus
Epiphanes took it by storm; and during three days
abandoned it to the fury of his soldiers. He caused
no less than 80,000 of its inhabitants to be inhumanly
butchered. Forty thousand men, also, were taken
prisoners, and the like number sold to the neighbouring
nations. He committed, also, a thousand
other atrocities.</p>

<p>We now come to the period in which it was besieged
by another Antiochus, viz. Antiochus Sidetes.
Hircanus having been, by the death of Simon, appointed
high-priest and prince of the Jews, Antiochus
marched with all possible haste, at the head of a
powerful army, to reduce Judea, and unite it to the
empire of Syria. Hircanus shut himself up in the
city, where he sustained a long siege with incredible
valour. At length he was compelled, by the extremity
of his necessities, to make proposals of peace.
Several of the king's councillors, however, advised
him not to listen to any proposals of that nature.
"The Jews," said they, "were driven out of Egypt,
as impious persons, hated by the gods, and abhorred
by men. They are enemies to all the rest of mankind.
They have no communication with any but
those of their own persuasion. They will neither
eat nor drink nor have any familiarity with other
people; they do not adore the gods that we do;
their laws, customs, manners, and religion, are entirely
different from those of all other nations; they therefore
deserve to be treated by all the nations with
equal contempt; to receive hatred for hatred; and
to be utterly extirpated."</p>

<p>Such was the language addressed to Antiochus;
and had he not been devout and generous, says
Diodorus, this advice had been followed.  He lis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>tened,
however, to milder counsels, and agreed that
the besieged should have leave to surrender their
arms; and that their fortifications being demolished,
a peace should be granted. All this was done.</p>

<p>Some years after this, Jerusalem was taken possession
of by the Romans under the command of
Pompey the Great, and the temple carried by storm.
There were two parties in the city. One, the adherents
of Hircanus, opened the gates; the other retired
to the mountain where the temple stood, and caused
the bridges of the ditch and valley which surrounded
it to be broken down. Upon this, Pompey, who
was already master of the city, ventured to besiege
the temple. The place held out three months, and
might, perhaps, have done so for three months longer,
and perhaps even obliged the Romans to abandon
their enterprise, but for the rigour with which the
besieged thought proper to observe the sabbath.
They believed, indeed, that they might defend themselves
when attacked; but not that they might prevent
the works of the enemy, or make any for themselves.
The Romans knew how to take advantage
of this inaction on sabbath-days. They did not
attack the Jews upon them; but filled up the fosses,
made their approaches, and fixed their engines without
opposition. At length, being able to make a
breach in the walls, the place was carried by the
sword, and not less than 12,000 persons were slain.
The victors entered the temple; and Pompey went
even so far as to penetrate to the Holy of Holies, and
altered the name of Jerusalem (then called Hierosolyma)
to Hierosolymarius. Not long after, Crassus,
marching against the Parthians, entered the
temple, the treasures of which Pompey held sacred,
and rifled it of a sum equivalent, in our money, to
&pound;1,500,000.</p>

<p>Pompey caused the walls to be demolished:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
C&aelig;sar afterwards caused them to be rebuilt; and
Antipater, executing that commission, soon put the
city into as good a position of defence as it had been
before the demolition. Notwithstanding this, Jerusalem
became subject to another siege by the Romans,
acting in behalf of Herod, with 60,000 men. The
place held out many months with great resolution;
and if the besieged had been as expert in the art of
war and the defence of places, as they were brave
and resolute, it would not, perhaps, have been taken.
But the Romans, who were much better skilled in
those things than they, carried the place, after a
siege of more than six months. They entered, made
themselves masters, plundered and destroyed all
before them, and filled every part of the city with
blood. The crown of all Judea was soon after
placed in the hands of a stranger,&mdash;an Idumean&mdash;(Herod);
in whose reign Jesus Christ was born.</p>

<p>During the reign of Herod the Great, Jerusalem
was much enlarged and embellished. He erected a
superb palace, a theatre, and an amphitheatre. He,
also, projected the design of enlarging the temple,<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
which had been erected after the return of the Jews
from the Babylonian captivity; and, having begun
the work in the eleventh year of his reign, he completed
it in eight years.</p>

<p>Tacitus call this erection "<i>immens&aelig; opulenti&aelig;
templum</i>;" and Josephus says, "it was the most
astonishing temple he had ever seen, as well on account
of its architecture as its magnitude; the richness
and magnificence of its various parts, and the
reputation of its sacred appurtenances." This temple
Herod began to build about sixteen years before the
birth of Christ. It was so far completed in nine
years and a half, as to be fit for divine service: and
what is very remarkable, it was afterwards destroyed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
by the Romans, in the same month and day of the
month, in which Solomon's temple had been destroyed
by the Babylonians.</p>

<p>In its most flourishing state Jerusalem was divided
into four parts, each separated by a wall, viz.
1. The old city of J&#275;bus, standing on Mount Zion,
where David built a magnificent palace and castle.
This part was called the city of David. 2. The
lower city; called the Daughter of Zion, in which
part Solomon built two magnificent palaces, for himself
and his queen; and which contained that of the
Maccabean princes; and the amphitheatre of Herod.
Also the citadel of Antiochus; and lastly the citadel
built by Herod, upon a high rock, and thence called
Antonia. 3. The "New City;" mostly inhabited by
merchants, tradesmen, and mechanics. 4. Mount
Moriah; on which Solomon built his temple.</p>

<p>The height of the temple thus repaired is said to
have been one thousand two hundred feet. The
stones of which it was built were all of marble,
forty cubits long, twelve thick, eight high, and so
exquisitely joined that they appeared to be of one
combined piece. There were one thousand four hundred
and fifty-three columns of Parian marble, and
two thousand nine hundred and six pilasters, of such
thickness, that three men could hardly embrace them;
and their height and capital proportionable, and all
of the Corinthian order.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> All the materials of the
original fabric were, as it is well known, finished
and adapted to their several ends before they were
brought to Jerusalem: that is, the stones in their
quarries, and the cedars in Lebanon; so that there
was no noise of axe, hammer, or any other tool,
heard in the rearing of it. There were no less than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
one hundred and sixty-three thousand men employed
in this work; and yet it took nine years in the
building.</p>

<p>The expense of building this wonderful structure
was prodigious: the gold and silver employed for
this purpose, amounted to 800,000,000<i>l.</i> sterling,
which, according to Prideaux's calculation, was a
sum equal to have built the whole of solid silver;
but it can scarcely be questioned, we think, that
some error has crept into the account<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>: There could
not have been so much bullion, much less coin, at
that time in the world.</p>

<p>In ancient Jerusalem there were ten gates and four
towers. Its extent was about one mile. In Solomon's
time, this extent appears to have been twice, if not
thrice, more. In the time of Titus it was four miles
125 paces. Eusebius lays the circumference at 2550
toises.</p>

<p>We must now proceed to give some account of the
destruction of the city by Titus<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>: and in doing so we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
shall adopt the description presented by the author
of&mdash;"On the Beauties, Harmonies, and Sublimities of
Nature."</p>

<p>"The war began in the month of May, <small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 66;
and the siege left to the management of Titus, April
14, <small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 70. Previous to the siege, the city was
a prey to the most intolerable anarchy; robbers
having broken into it, and filled almost every house
with thieves, assassins, and broilers, of every description.
The best citizens were thrown into prisons, and
afterwards murdered, without even a form of trial.
At this time Titus appeared before the gates&mdash;a vast
multitude having previously arrived in the city to
celebrate the feast of the passover. During this celebrated
siege, there were no less than three earthquakes;
and an aurora borealis terrified the inhabitants
with forms, which their fears and astonishment
converted into prodigies of enemies fighting in the air,
and flaming swords hanging over their temple. They
were visited with a plague, so dreadful, that more
than one hundred and fifty thousand persons were
carried out of the city, at the public charge, to be
buried; and six hundred and fifty thousand were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
cast over the walls, and out of the gates. A famine
ensued; and so horrible was the want, that a bushel
of corn sold for six hundred crowns. The populace
were reduced to the necessity of taking old excrement
of horses, mules, and oxen, to satisfy their hunger;
and a lady of quality even boiled her own child
and ate it&mdash;a crime so exquisite, that Titus vowed to
the eternal Gods, that he would bury its infamy in
the ruins of the city. He took it soon after by
storm; the plough was drawn over it; and with the
exception of the west walls, and three towers, not
one stone remained above another. Ninety thousand
persons were made captives; and one million one
hundred thousand perished during the siege. Those
made captives being sold to several nations, they were
dispersed over a great portion of the ancient world;
and from them are descended the present race of Jews,
scattered singly, and in detached portions, in every
province of Europe, and in most districts of Africa
and Asia. Thus terminated this memorable siege&mdash;a
siege the results of which meet the eye in every
Jew we meet."</p>

<p>The Jews having, in the reign of Adrian, given way
to a turbulent disposition, that emperor resolved to
level all things to the ground&mdash;that is, those buildings
which the Jews had erected to destroy the
towers, that were left by Titus for the convenience of
the Roman garrison; and to sow salt in the ground
on which the city had stood. Thus did Adrian
literally fulfil the prophecy, that neither in the city,
nor in the temple, should one stone be left upon
another. This final destruction took place forty-seven
years after that of Titus.</p>

<p>A new city, under the name of &AElig;lia Capitolina,
was soon after built, where the presence of the Jews
was absolutely prohibited. In this new city, the
Christians were sometimes persecuted, and sometimes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
protected, by the Roman emperors, till the time when
the empress Helena came to visit the city; when,
finding it in a most forlorn and ruinous condition, she
formed the design of restoring it to its ancient lustre;
and her son, Constantine, having embraced the Christian
doctrine, he issued an edict, that the old name of
Jerusalem should be employed when speaking of the
city.</p>

<p>A few years after, an attempt was made to rebuild
the temple by the emperor Julian, an attempt which
is recorded as having proved abortive, from fiery
eruptions escaping out of the earth, and dispersing
the workmen.</p>

<p>In the reign of Justinian, that emperor built a
magnificent church at Jerusalem; the foundation
being formed by raising part of a deep valley. The
stones of a neighbouring quarry were hewn into
regular forms; each block was fixed on a peculiar
carriage drawn by forty of the strongest oxen, and
the roads were widened for the passage of such
enormous weights. Lebanon furnished her loftiest
cedars for the timbers of the church; and the seasonable
discovery of a vein of red marble supplied its
beautiful columns;&mdash;two of which, the supporters of
the extensive portico, were esteemed the largest in
the world.</p>

<p>In 613, Jerusalem was taken by Chosroes, king
of Persia. The sepulchre of Christ and the stately
churches of Helena and Constantine were consumed;
the devout offerings of three hundred years were
rifled, "the true cross" was transported into Persia;
and the massacre of ninety thousand Christians is
imputed to the Jews and Arabs, who swelled the
disorder of the Persian march.</p>

<p>It was recaptured by Heraclius in 627. This
emperor banished all the Jews, and interdicted
them from coming nearer to it than three miles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span></p>

<p>Nine years after this, Jerusalem was taken by
Khaled, one of Omar's generals. Omar being apprised
of this success of his arms, immediately set out to visit
the Holy City. He was attended in his journey by
a numerous retinue. He rode upon a red camel, and
carried with him two sacks of provision and fruits.
Before him he had a leather bottle containing water,
and behind him a wooden platter, out of which many
of his retinue ate in common with himself. His
clothes were made of camels' hair, and were in a very
tattered condition; and the figure he made was mean
and sordid to the last degree. On the morning after
his arrival, he said prayers and preached to his troops.
After the conclusion of his sermon, he pitched his
tent within sight of the city. There he signed the
articles of capitulation; by which the inhabitants
were entitled to the free exercise of their religion,
the possession of their property, and his protection.</p>

<p>It continued under the caliphs of Bagdad till<span class="smcap"> <small>A.&nbsp;D.</small></span>
868, when it was taken by a Turkish sovereign of
Egypt; during the space of two hundred and twenty
years it was subject to several masters, Turkish and
Saracenic; and in 1099, it was taken by the crusaders
under Godfrey of Bouillon, who was elected
king. He was succeeded by his brother Baldwin,
who died <small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 1118, and having no son, his eldest
daughter, Melisandra, conveyed the kingdom into
her husband's family. In <small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 1188, Saladin, sultan
of the East, captured the city, assisted by Raymond,
count of Tripoli, who was found dead in his bed on the
morning of the day on which he was to have delivered
up the city. It was restored in 1242 to the Latin princes
by Salah Ismael, emir of Damascus. They lost it in
1291 to the sultans of Egypt, who held it till 1382.</p>

<p>Selim, the Turkish sultan, reduced Egypt and Syria,
including Jerusalem, in 1517, and his son Solyman
built the present walls in 1534. It continues to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
present day under the Turkish dominion, fulfilling
the prophecy, that it "should be trodden down of
the Gentiles." It is not, therefore, only in the
history of Josephus, and in other ancient writers,
that we are to look for the accomplishment of
Christ's prediction; we see them verified at this moment
before our eyes, in the desolate state of this
once celebrated city and temple, and in the present
condition of the Jewish people; not collected together
into any one country, into one political society,
and under one form of government, but dispersed into
every region of the globe, and everywhere treated
with contumely and scorn.</p>

<p>We now proceed to give some account of the city,
as it now stands, from various travellers who have
visited it; confining ourselves, however, almost entirely
to what may be called its antiquities.</p>

<p>The following particulars in regard to the approach
to Jerusalem are from the pen of Mr. Robinson.</p>

<p>"As we approach Jerusalem, the road becomes
more and more rugged, and all the appearance of
vegetation ceases; the rocks are scantily covered with
soil, and what little verdure might have existed in
the spring, is in the autumn entirely burnt up.
There is a like absence of animal life; and it is no
exaggeration to say, here man dwelleth not; the
beast wandereth not; the bird flieth not; indeed,
nothing indicates the approach to the ancient metropolis
of Judea, unless it be the apparent evidences
of a curse upon its soil, impressed in the dreadful
characters just mentioned, whilst the 'inhabitants
thereof,' are 'scattered abroad.' Oftentimes on the
road was I tempted to exclaim, like the stranger that
was come from a strange land, 'Wherefore hath the
Lord done this unto the land? what meaneth the
heat of this great anger<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>?'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Clarke, however, was nevertheless struck with
its grandeur. He says that, instead of a wretched
and ruined town, as he had expected, he beheld a
flourishing and stately metropolis, domes, towers,
palaces, and monasteries, shining in the sun's rays
with inconceivable splendour. "Like many other
ancient places," says a French commentator on this
account, "it no doubt presents two aspects; a mixture
of magnificence and paltriness."</p>

<p>To the southward of the site of Bethlehem stands
the city castle<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>. It is composed of towers connected
by curtains, which form two or three enclosures,
the interior successively commanding the exterior.
A few old guns, mounted on broken carriages, are
planted on its walls to keep the Arabs in awe. The
castle is sometimes called the castle of Daniel; and
sometimes of the Pisans, having been erected by
that people when the city was in the hands of the
Christians. From one of the windows looking north,
travellers are shown the site of the house of Uriah;
and a piece of ground attached to it, and just within the
walls, an old tank, called Bathsheba's bath. But the
place where the latter was bathing, when seen by the
amorous monarch, was more probably the great basin
lying in the ravine to the south of the castle at the
foot of Mount Zion, and called the lower pool of
Gihon.</p>

<p>The sides of the hill of Zion have a pleasing appearance;
as they possess a few olive-trees and rude
gardens, and a crop of corn was growing there when
Mr. Carne visited it. On its southern extremity is
the mosque of David, which is held in the highest
reverence by the Turks, who affirm that the remains
of that monarch, and his son Solomon, were interred
there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span></p>

<p>The palace of Pilate is now a Turkish residence,
and stands near to the gateway by which Christ was led
thence to Calvary, to be crucified. Here is pointed
out the spot on which Pilate presented Jesus to the
people, declaring he could find no guilt in him; the
place on which he fainted under the weight of the
cross, and where the Virgin swooned, also, at the
sight; the spot where Veronica gave him her handkerchief
to wipe his forehead; and lastly, where the
soldiers compelled Simon of Cyrene to bear his cross.
In the palace the monk points out the room where
Christ was confined before his trial; and at a short
distance is a dark and ruinous hall, shown as the arch
where Christ stood till his judge exclaimed "Behold
the man<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>!"</p>

<p>One of the streets is said to be the same where
Christ made his first appearance after his resurrection;
and in the same street stands an Armenian
convent, erected over the spot on which James, the
brother of John, was beheaded. This is one of the
finest buildings in Jerusalem<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>. At a short distance
is a small church, said to be erected on the spot
where formerly stood the house of the high-priest
Annas; and, a little farther on, another which marks
the house of Caiaphas; while, just beyond the gate,
the attention is directed to a mosque, where the
house stood in which Christ ate his last supper.</p>

<p>The mosque of Omar, which occupies the site of
the Jewish temple, loses nothing of its grandeur or
beauty on a near approach. The spacious paved
courts, the flights of steps, and surrounding arcades,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
the dark tall cypress-trees and running fountains,
and the large octagonal body of the mosque, with its
surrounding domes, produce altogether the finest
effect, and increase the desire to enter its forbidden
walls. It is said to be the most magnificent piece of
architecture in the Turkish empire; far superior to
the mosque of St. Sophia in Constantinople. By
the sides of the spacious area in which it stands are
several vaulted remains; and evidence is said to be
capable of proving, that they belonged to the foundation
of Solomon's temple<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>.</p>

<p>Chateaubriand says, that he was strongly tempted
to find some mode of penetrating to the interior of
the mosque; but was prevented by the fear, that he
might thereby involve the whole Christian population
of Jerusalem in destruction. Dr. Richardson, however,
succeeded in gratifying a similar curiosity,
which he shared in common with a host of other
travellers.</p>

<p>The Tomb of Zacharias is square, with four or five
pillars, and is cut out of the rock. Near this is a sort
of grotto, hewn out of the elevated part of the rock,
with four pillars in front, which is said to have
been the apostles' prison at the time they were confined
by the rulers.</p>

<p>At a small distance within the gates of St. Stephen,
that fronts Olivet, is the pool of Bethesda, said
to be the scene of one of Christ's most striking miracles.
The pool is at present dry, and its bed nearly filled
up with earth and rubbish. Wild tamarisk bushes
and pomegranate trees spread their foliage round it;
but, according to Chateaubriand, the mason-work of
the sides, composed of large stones, joined together
by iron cramps, may still be traced; making the
measurement of this reservoir to have been in width<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
40 feet, and in length 150. At its eastern end are
some arches dammed up. It is evidently the most
ancient work in Jerusalem, and, as such, is an interesting
specimen of the primitive architecture of
its inhabitants. All travellers seem to agree that
this was the pool of Bethesda, memorable in the
Gospel history as the scene of the paralytic, related in
St. John. It was here, perhaps, that the sheep were
marked, preparatory to the sacrifices of the temple<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>.</p>

<p>"At about two-thirds of the ascent of the Mount
of Olives," says Mr. Robinson, "we were shown the
place where our Lord, looking down upon the city,
wept over its impending fate. 'Seest thou these
great buildings? There shall not be left one stone
upon another, that shall not be thrown down<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>.'"</p>

<p>"From the summit," says Mr. Carne, "you enjoy
an admirable view of the city. It is beneath, and
very near, and looks, with its valleys around it, like
a panorama. This noble mosque of Omar, and large
area, planted with palms, its narrow streets, ruinous
places and towers, are all laid out before you, as you
have seen Naples and Corfu in Leicester-square. On
the summit are the remains of a church, built by the
empress Helena; and in a small edifice, containing
one large and lofty apartment, is shown the print of
the last footsteps of Christ, when he took his leave of
earth."</p>

<p>"About forty years," says Dr. Clarke, "before
the idolatrous profanation of the Mount of Olives by
Solomon, his afflicted parent, driven from Jerusalem
by his son Absalom, came to this eminence to present
a less offensive sacrifice, and, as it is beautifully expressed
by Adichomius, 'flens et nudis pedibus
adoravit,' what a scene does the sublime description,
given by the prophet, picture to the imagination of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
every one who has felt the influence of filial piety,
but especially of the traveller, standing upon the very
spot where the aged monarch gave to heaven the
offering of his wounded spirit. "And David went up
by the ascent of Mount Olives, and wept as he went
up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot,
and all the people that was with him covered every
man his head; and they went up weeping."</p>

<p>On the top of the mount are the remains of several
works, the history of which has been lost. Among
these are several subterraneous chambers. One of
them has the shape of a cone, of very large size. It
is upon the very pinnacle of the mountain.</p>

<p>"The Mount of Olives," says Mons. La Martine,
"slopes suddenly and rapidly down to the deep
abyss, called the Valley of Jehoshaphat, which separates
it from Jerusalem. From the bottom of this
sombre and narrow valley, the barren sides of which
are everywhere paved with black and white stones,
the funereal stones of death, rises an immense hill,
with so abrupt an elevation, that it resembles a fallen
rampart: no tree here strikes its roots; no moss even
can here fix its filaments. The slope is so steep that
the earth and stones continually roll from it, and it
presents to the eye only a surface of dry dust, as if
powdered cinders had been thrown upon it. From
the heights of the city, towards the middle of this
hill, or natural rampart, rise high and strong walls of
large stones, not externally sawed by the mason,
which conceal their Hebrew and Roman foundations
beneath the same cinders, and are here from fifty to
one hundred, and further on, from two to three hundred
feet in height. The walls are here cut by three
city gates, two of which are fastened up, and the only
one open before us seems as void and as desolate as
if it gave entrance to an uninhabited town. The
walls, rising again beyond this gate, sustain a large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
and vast terrace, which runs along two-thirds of the
length of Jerusalem, on the eastern side; and, judging
by the eye, may be a thousand feet in length, and
five or six hundred in breadth. It is nearly level,
except at its centre, where it sinks insensibly, as if
to recall to the eye the <i>valley of little depth</i>, which
formerly separated the hill of Sion from the city of
Jerusalem. This magnificent platform, prepared no
doubt by nature, but evidently finished by the hand
of man, was the sublime pedestal upon which arose
the temple of Solomon. It now supports two Turkish
mosques."</p>

<p>Acra Hill<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> rose to the north of Sion, the east side
facing mount Moriah, on which the temple was
situated, and from which this hill was separated only
by a chasm, which the Asmoneans partly filled up
by lowering the summit of Acra. As we are informed
by Josephus, Antiochus Epiphanes erected
a fortress upon it to overawe the city and the temple;
which fortress, having a Greek or Macedonian garrison,
held out against the Jews till the time of Simon,
who demolished it, and at the same time levelled the
summit of the hill.</p>

<p>The east side of Mount Moriah<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> bordered the valley
of Kedron, commonly called the Valley of Jehoshaphat,
which was very deep: the south side, overlooking a
very low spot, (the Tyrop&#339;on,) was faced, from top
to bottom, with a strong wall, and had a bridge going
across the valley for its communication with Sion.
The east side looked towards Acra, the appearance of
which from the temple is compared by Josephus to a
theatre; and on the north side an artificial ditch, says
the same historian, separated the temple from a hill
named Begetha, which was afterwards joined to the
town, by an extension of its area.</p>

<p>The loftiest, the most extensive, and in all respects<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
the most conspicuous eminence, included within the site
of the ancient city, was that of Sion, called the Holy
Hill, and the citadel of David. This we have positive
authority for fixing on the south of the city. David
himself saith, "Beautiful for situation, the joy of the
whole earth, is Mount Zion; on the sides of the north
the city of the great King<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>."</p>

<p>"On its summit," says La Martine, "at some
hundred paces from Jerusalem, stands a mosque and
a group of Turkish edifices, not unlike an European
hamlet, crowned with its church and steeple. This
is Sion! the palace, the tomb of David! the seat of
his inspiration and of his joys, of his life and his
repose! A spot doubly sacred to me, who have so
often felt my heart touched, and my thoughts rapt by
the sweet singer of Israel, the first poet of sentiment,
the king of lyrics. Never have human fibres vibrated
to harmonies so deep, so penetrating, so solemn; all
the most secret murmurs of the human heart found
their voice and their note on the lips and the heart of
this minstrel! and if we revert to the remote period
when such chants were first echoed on the earth; if
we consider that at the same period the lyric poetry of
the most cultivated nations sang only of wine, love, and
war, and the victories of the muses, or of the coursers
at the Eleian games, we dwell with profound astonishment
on the mystic accents of the prophet king, who
addresses God the Creator, as friend talks to friend,
comprehends and adores his wonders, admires his
judgments, implores his mercies, and seems to be an
anticipating echo of the evangelic poetry, repeating
the mild accents of Christ, before they had been
heard. Prophet or poet, as he is contemplated by
the philosopher or christian, neither of them can deny
the poet king an inspiration, bestowed on no other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
man! Read Horace or Pindar after a Psalm? For
my part I cannot!"</p>

<p>Near Jerusalem is a spot called Tophet, which is a
ravine, which contains several ancient tombs, marked
with Hebrew and Greek inscriptions. This valley is
remarkable for the barbarous worship here paid to
Moloch; to which deity parents often sacrificed their
offspring by making them pass through the fire. To
drown the lamentable shrieks of the children<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> thus immolated,
musical instruments were played. After the
captivity the Jews regarded this spot with abhorrence,
on account of the abominations which had been practised
there; and following the example of Josiah<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>,
they threw into it every species of filth, as well as the
carcases of animals, and the dead bodies of malefactors;
and to prevent the pestilence which such a mass
would occasion, if left to putrefy, constant fires were
maintained in the valley in order to consume the
whole; hence the place received the appellation of
Gehenna.</p>

<p>All round the hill of Sion<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>, and particularly on
that facing the Valley of Hinnom, are numerous excavations
which may have been habitations of the
living, but are more generally taken for sepulchres
of the dead. They are numerous and varied, both
in their sizes and forms; and are supposed to have
been the tombs of the sons of Heth, of the kings of
Israel, of Lazarus, and of Christ.</p>

<p>The modern sepulchres of the unfortunate Jews
are scattered all around. The declivities of Sion
and Olivet are covered with small and ill-shaped
stones, disposed with little order:&mdash;Here are the
tombs of their fathers.</p>

<p>The sepulchres of the kings of Judah consist of a
series of subterranean chambers, extending in dif<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>ferent
directions, so as to form a sort of labyrinth,
resembling the still more wonderful example, lying
westward of Alexandria, in Egypt, by some called
"the Sepulchres of the Ptolemies." Each chamber
contains a certain number of receptacles for dead
bodies, not being much larger than our coffins. The
taste, manifested in the interior of these chambers,
denotes a late period in the history of the arts. The
skill and neatness visible in the carving is admirable,
and there is much of ornament in several parts of
the work. There are, also, slabs of marble, exquisitely
sculptured. These sepulchres are not those of
the kings of Judah. Some suppose they may have
been constructed by Agrippa, who extended and
beautified this quarter of the city; but the most
current opinion is, that they were the work of Helena,
queen of Aliabene, and her son Izatus.</p>

<p>The Sepulchres of the Patriarchs face that part
of Jerusalem where the Temple of Solomon was
formerly erected. The antiquities which particularly
bear this name, are four in number: these are
the sepulchres of Jehoshaphat, of Absalom, the cave
of St. James, and the sepulchre of Zechariah.
These tombs display an alliance of the Egyptian
and Grecian taste, "forming, as it were," says Chateaubriand,
"a link between the Pyramids and the
Parthenon." "In order to form the sepulchres of
Absalom and Zechariah," says Dr. Clarke, "the
solid substance of the mountain has been cut away;
sufficient areas being thereby excavated, two monuments
of prodigious size appear in the midst; each
seeming to consist of a single stone, although standing
as if erected by an architect, and adorned with
columns, appearing to support the edifice, whereof
they are, in fact, integral parts; the whole of each
mausoleum being of one entire block of stone. These
works may, therefore, be considered as belonging to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
sculpture, rather than to architecture: for, immense
as these are, they appeared sculptured instead of
being built. The columns are of that ancient style
and character, which yet appear among the works
left by Ionian and Dorian colonies, in the remains of
their Asiatic cities."</p>

<p>The sepulchre of Absalom, and the cave of St.
James, are smaller works, but of the same nature
as those above. All of them contain apartments
and receptacles for the dead, hewn in the same
curious manner.</p>

<p>A few paces to the north of the grot,<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> is a substantial
stone building, resembling the dome of a
church, almost even with the ground, having a
pointed gothic doorway. It covers the reputed tomb
of the blessed Virgin; and its construction, like other
great monuments of this country, is attributed to
the pious mother of Constantine. The descent to
it is by a broad and handsome flight of forty-six
stone steps. On the right-hand side, about half
way down, is shown the cenotaph, erected to the
memory of Joahim and Anne, the father and mother
of Mary; and, in a recess on the opposite side, that
of Joseph her husband. A further descent leads
into a subterraneous chapel, lit up with lamps,
which are kept continually burning. In the centre,
a little to the right, is an altar, erected over the
sacred tomb, which is an excavation in the rock.
Behind, in the curve of the chapel, is an altar, at
which mass is occasionally said.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>"The tomb of the Virgin," says Dr. Clarke, "is
the largest of all the crypt&aelig;. Near Jerusalem,
appropriate chapels, within a lofty and spacious
vault, distinguish the real or imaginary tombs of the
Virgin Mary, of Joseph, of Anna, and of Caiaphas.
Struck with wonder, not only in viewing such an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
extraordinary effort of human labour, but in the consideration
that history affords no light whatever as to
its origin, we came afterwards to examine it again,
but could assign no probable date for the era of its
construction. It ranks among those colossal works,
which were accomplished by the inhabitants of Asia
Minor, of Ph&#339;nicia, and of Palestine, in the first
ages;&mdash;works, which differ from those of Greece,
in displaying less of beauty, but more of arduous
enterprise; works, which remind us of the people
rather than the artist; which we refer to as monuments
of history, rather than of taste."</p>

<p>The circumstance<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> that perplexes every traveller,
is to account for Mount Calvary having been
formerly <i>without</i> the city, whereas it is, at present,
not a small way <i>within</i>; and in order to shut it out,
the ancient walls must have made the most extraordinary
and unnecessary curve imaginable. But tradition
could not err in the identity of so famous a
spot; and the smallest scepticism would deprive it of
its principal charm.</p>

<p>The street leading to Calvary is called by the
Christians Via Dolorosa, or "Dolorous Way," in
commemoration of the sufferings of Christ, in the
carrying of the cross to the place of execution. It
rises with a gradual ascent as it approaches Calvary,
where it terminates. There are many interesting
spots in this way; and Mr. Robinson thus describes
them:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) "An archway across the street, designated the
Arch of the Ecce Homo, over which there is a double
window, separated by a column. Here Pilate
brought the Lord forth to the people, saying,&mdash;'Behold
the Man!'&mdash;(John xix. 6).</p>

<p>(2.) "The place where Christ turned round to
the women, who followed him with their lamenta<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>tions,
and, moved by the tears of his countrymen,
he addressed them in the language of consolation;
'Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me.'&mdash;(Luke
xxiii. 28.) Where the Virgin, witness of the trying
scene, and overcome by the feelings of a mother,
fell into a swoon.</p>

<p>(3.) "Where Christ, falling down under the weight
of the cross, the soldiers compelled Simon the Cyrenian
to assist him,&mdash;(Luke xxiii. 26); it is marked
out by the broken shaft of a column, just where the
lower city terminates.</p>

<p>(4.) "The dwelling of Lazarus.</p>

<p>(5.) "The dwelling of the rich man.</p>

<p>(6.) "The house from which Veronica, or Berenice,
issued, to present our Lord with a handkerchief, to
wipe his bleeding brows.</p>

<p>(7.) "The gate of judgment, formerly the boundary
of the city.</p>

<p>"And finally, Calvary, the scene of his crucifixion."</p>

<p>The church, which is regarded as marking the site
of the Holy Sepulchre, in Dr. Clarke's opinion,
exhibits nowhere the slightest evidence which can
entitle it to either of these appellations. He is,
therefore, disposed to believe, that the crucifixion
took place upon the opposite summit, now called
Mount Sion.</p>

<p>Dr. Clarke says, in reference to another cavern:
"There was one, which particularly attracted our
notice, from its extraordinary coincidence with all
the circumstances attaching to the history of our
Saviour's tomb. The large stone which once closed
its mouth had been, perhaps for ages, rolled away.
Stooping down to look into it, we observed within
a fair sepulchre, containing a repository upon one
side only for a single body: whereas, in most of the
others, there were two, and in many of them more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
than two. It is placed exactly opposite to that
which is now called Mount Sion. As we viewed
the sepulchre, and read upon the spot the description
given of Mary Magdalene and the disciples coming
in the morning,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> it was impossible to divest our
minds of the probability, that here might have been
the identical tomb of Jesus Christ; and that up
the steep, which led to it, after descending from the
gate of the city, the disciples strove together,<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> when
"John did out-run Peter, and came first to the
sepulchre."<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>"On leaving the Church of the Holy Sepulchre,"
says Mons. la Martine, "we followed the Via Dolorosa,
of which M. de Chateaubriand has given so
poetical an itinerary. Here is nothing striking,
nothing verified, nothing even probable. Ruined
houses, of modern construction, are everywhere exhibited
to the pilgrims by the monks as incontestible
vestiges of the various stations of Christ. The eye
cannot even doubt; all confidence in these local
traditions is annihilated beforehand by the history of
the first years of Christianity, where we read that
Jerusalem no longer retained one stone upon another,
and that Christians were for many years exiled from
the city. Some pools, and the tombs of her kings,
are the only memorials Jerusalem retains of her past
eventful story; a few sites alone can be recognised&mdash;as
that of the Temple, indicated by its terraces, and
now bearing the large and magnificent mosque of
Omar al Sakara; Mount Sion occupied by the
Armenian convent, and the tomb of David; and it
is only with history in one's hand, and with a doubting
eye, that the greater part of these can be assigned
with any degree of precision. Except the terraced
walls in the valley of Jehoshaphat, no stone bears its
date in its form or colour;&mdash;all is in ashes, or all is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
modern. The mind wanders in uncertainty over the
horizon of the city, not knowing where to rest; but
the city itself, designated by the circumscribed hill
on which it stood, by the different valleys which
encircled it, and especially by the deep valley of
Cedron, is a monument which no eye can mistake.
There, truly, was Sion seated; a singular and unfortunate
site for the capital of a great nation. It is
rather the natural fortress of a small people, driven
from the earth, and taking refuge, with their God
and their Temple, on a soil that none could have any
interest in disputing with them; on rocks which no
roads can render accessible; amidst valleys destitute
of water; in a rough and sterile climate; its only
prospect mountains, calcined by the eternal fires of
volcanoes; the mountains of Arabia and Jericho;
and an infectious lake, without shore or navigation&mdash;the
Dead Sea."</p>

<p>The Garden of Gethsemane<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> is, not without reason,
shown as the scene of our Saviour's agony, the
night before his crucifixion, both from the circumstance
of the name it still retains, and its situation
in regard to the city. Titus, it is true, cut down
all the wood in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem; and
were this not the case, no reasonable person would
regard it as a remnant of so remote an age, notwithstanding
the story of the olive shown in the citadel
of Athens, and supposed to bear date from the
foundation of the city. But, as a spontaneous produce,
uninterruptedly resulting from the original
growth of the mountain, it is impossible to view even
those with indifference.</p>

<p>In the upper end of the garden is a naked ledge of
rocks<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>, where Peter, James, and John slept. The
exact limits of this, the most interesting and hallowed
of all gardens, are not known, nor is it necessary to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
know them; but as we read that "Christ went forth
with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where there
was a garden" (John xviii. 1), and that this garden
was in the Mount of Olives, "we felt satisfied," says
Mr. Robinson, "that we stood on the ground whereon
the Saviour had stood before; and that the aged trees,
which now afforded us shade, were the lineal descendants
of those under which he often reposed;
but more particularly on the night of his ascent.
The grot, to which he retired on this occasion, and
where, "falling down to the ground," in the agony
of his soul, and "sweating," as it were, "great
drops of blood," he was comforted by an angel
(Luke xxii. 43, 44), is still shown, and venerated
as such. It is excavated in the live rock, and the descent
to it is by a flight of rudely cut steps; the form
of the interior is circular, about fifteen feet in diameter,
and the roof, which is supported by pilasters,
perforated in the middle to admit light: there are
some remains of sepulchres in the sides.</p>

<p>The cave of Gethsemane is in the valley of Jehoshaphat:&mdash;"It
was to this cavern," says La Martine,
"at the foot of the Mount of Olives, that Christ
retired, according to tradition, to escape sometimes
from the persecution of his enemies and the importunities
of his disciples; it was here he communed
with his own divine reflections, and that he implored
his Father, that the bitter cup that he had filled for
himself, and which we fill for ourselves, should pass
from his lips. It was here that he enjoined his three
disciples to watch and pray, the evening before his
death, and not to sleep&mdash;and that three times he
returned and awakened them, so prone is human
zeal and charity to slumber. It was here he passed
the terrible hours of his agony&mdash;the ineffable struggle
between life and death&mdash;between instinct and will&mdash;between
the soul that wishes to be free, and matter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
which resists because of its blindness. It was here
he sweated blood and water, and that, weary of combating
with himself, without obtaining that victory
of his intellect, which would give peace to his
thoughts, he uttered those words, which sum up all
human godliness; those words which are become the
wisdom of the wise, and which ought to be the
epitaph of every life, and the sole aspiration of every
created being; 'My father, not my will, but thine,
be done!'"</p>

<p>The Valley of Jehoshaphat<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> was a deep and narrow
valley, enclosed on the north by barren heights, which
contained the sepulchres of kings, shaded on the
west by the heavy and gigantic walls of a pre-existing
city; covered at the east by the summit of
the Mount of Olives, and crossed by a torrent which
rolled its bitter and yellow waves over the broken
rocks of the valley of Jehoshaphat. At some paces
distant, a black and bare rock detaches itself like a
promontory from the base of the mountain, and, suspended
over Cedron and the valley, bears several old
tombs of kings and patriarchs, formed in gigantic
and singular architecture, and strikes like the bridge
of death over the valley of lamentations.</p>

<p>The fountain of Siloam<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> rises about half way
down Mount Sion, and gushes from beneath a little
arch, nearly ten feet below the surface, into a small
pool about two feet deep; this is quite open, and
the rocky sides of the spot are cut smooth. On the
south side a flight of steps leads down to it: the
water is clear and cold, and flows down the mount
into the valley beneath, to a considerable distance.
At this stream the women of the city generally come
to wash their linen; and its banks are in some parts
shaded with trees<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>.</p>

<p>The Church of the Holy Sepulchre has the external<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
appearance of a Roman Catholic church. Over the
door is a bas-relief, executed in a style of sculpture
which at first sight implies an antiquity higher than
that of any Christian place of worship; but, upon a
nearer view, is recognized the history of the Messiah's
entry into Jerusalem. Dr. Clarke is, therefore, disposed
to think, that it offers an example of the first
work in which Pagan sculptors represented a Christian
theme. The interior of this fabric is divided into
two parts; and in the anti-chapel is shown the mouth
of what is called the sepulchre, the stone whereon
the angel sat: this is a block of white marble<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>.</p>

<p>The Stone of Unction is covered by a slab of polished
marble in the floor of the entrance hall of the
Holy Sepulchre. On this the body of Christ was
washed, anointed, and prepared for the tomb. (St.
John, xix. 39.) It is surrounded by a low rail;
and several rich lamps are hung suspended over it.
Advancing a few paces to the left, we come into that
part of the church, properly denominated the nave.
It is an open space in the form of a circle, about
thirty-five paces in diameter, and surrounded by sixteen
pillars, supporting galleries, and covered in by a
dome, not unlike that of the Pantheon at Rome. In
the centre of this area, and immediately under the
aperture through which the light is admitted, rises a
small oblong building of marble, twenty feet in
length, by ten in breadth, and about fifteen feet in
height, surmounted by a small cupola, standing
upon columns; this covers the supposed site of the
Saviour's tomb. It is approached by steps leading
into an anti-room, or chapel<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>.</p>

<p>The following account is given by Dr. Richardson:&mdash;"Having
passed within these sacred walls,"
says he, "the attention is first directed to a large flat
stone in the floor, a little within the door; it is sur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>rounded
by a rail, and several lamps hang suspended
over it. The pilgrims approach it on their knees,
touch and kiss it, and, prostrating themselves before
it, offer up their prayers in holy adoration. This is
the stone, it is said, on which the body of our Lord
was washed and anointed, and prepared for the tomb.
Turning to the left, and proceeding a little forward,
we came into a round space immediately under the
dome, surrounded with sixteen large columns which
support the gallery above. In the centre of this space
stands the Holy Sepulchre; it is enclosed in an
oblong house, rounded at one end, with small arcades,
or chapels for prayer, on the outside of it. These are
for the Copts, the Abyssinians, the Syrian Maronites,
and other Christians, who are not, like the Roman
Catholics, the Greeks, and Armenians, provided with
large chapels in the body of the church. At the
other end it is squared off, and furnished with a platform
in front, which is ascended by a flight of steps,
having a small parapet wall of marble on each hand,
and floored with the same material. In the middle
of this small platform, stands a block of polished marble,
about a foot and a half square; on this stone (it
is said) sat the angel, who announced the blessed
tidings of the resurrection to Mary Magdalene, and
Joanna, and Mary the mother of James. Advancing,
and taking off our shoes and turbans at the
desire of the keeper, he drew aside the curtain, and
stepping down, and bending almost to the ground, we
entered by a low narrow door into this mansion of
victory, where Christ triumphed over the grave, and
disarmed Death of all his terrors. Here the mind
looks on Him, who, though He knew no sin, yet entered
the mansion of the dead to redeem us from
death, and the prayers of a grateful heart ascend with
a risen Saviour to the presence of God in heaven."</p>

<p>"Christians," says Mons. Chateaubriand, "will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
inquire, perhaps, what my feelings were on entering
this holy place? I really cannot tell. So many reflections
rushed at once into my mind, that I was
unable to dwell upon any particular idea. I continued
near half an hour upon my knees, in the little
chamber of the Holy Sepulchre, with my eyes riveted
upon the stone, from which I had not the power to
turn them. One of the two monks, who accompanied
me, remained prostrate on the marble by my side;
while the other, with the Testament in his hand, read
to me, by the light of the lamps, the passages relating
to the sacred tomb. All I can say is, that when I
beheld this triumphant sepulchre, I felt nothing
but my own weakness; and that when my guide
exclaimed, with St. Paul, 'O Death, where is thy
victory? O Grave, where is thy sting?' I listened,
as if Death was about to reply, that he was conquered,
and enchained in this monument<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>."</p>

<h2><a name="NO_XLV_LACEDAEMON_OR_SPARTA" id="NO_XLV_LACEDAEMON_OR_SPARTA"></a>NO. XLV.&mdash;LACED&AElig;MON, OR SPARTA.</h2>


<p>Leli&aelig;, the first king of Laconia, began his reign
about 1516 years before the Christian era. Tyndarus<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>,
the ninth king of Laced&aelig;mon, had, by Leda,
Castor and Pollux, who were twins, besides Helena,
and Clytemnestra, the wife of Agamemnon, king of
Mycen&aelig;. Having survived his son, he began to
think of choosing a successor, by looking out for a
husband for his daughter Helena. All the pretenders
to this princess bound themselves by oath, to abide
by, and entirely submit to, the choice which the lady
herself should make, who determined in favour of
Menelaus. She had not lived above three years with
her husband, before she was carried off by Paris, son<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
of Priam, king of the Trojans, which rape was the
cause of the Trojan war. The Greeks took Troy
after a siege of ten years, about the year of the world
2820, and 1184 before Christ.</p>

<p>Eighty years after the taking of this city, the
Heraclid&aelig; re-entered the Peloponnesus, and seized
Laced&aelig;mon; when two brothers, Eurysthenes and
Procles, sons of Aristodemus, began to reign together,
and from their time the sceptre always continued
jointly in the hands of the descendants of those two
families.</p>

<p>Many years after this, Lycurgus instituted that
body of laws, which rendered both the legislature
and the republic so famous in history: and since the
constitution of Lycurgus seems to have been the true
groundwork of our own, we insert some few particulars
in respect to it; for the ruins of institutions
are even more important subjects of contemplation
than those of the walls in which they were engendered.
The following account is taken from Rollin.
We have not space, however, for the whole of his
observations; we shall select, therefore, only the
most important ones. Of all the institutions, made
by Lycurgus, the most considerable was that of the
senate; which, by tempering and balancing the too
absolute power of the kings by an authority of equal
weight and influence with theirs, became the principal
support and preservation of the state. For
whereas, before, it was ever unsteady, and tending
one while to tyranny, by the violent proceedings of
the kings; at other times towards democracy, by the
excessive power of the people, the senate served as
a kind of counterpoise to both; which kept the state
in a due equilibrium, and preserved it in a firm and
steady situation; the twenty-eight senators, of which
it consisted, siding with the king, when the people
were aiming at too much power; and, on the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
hand, espousing the interests of the people whenever
the kings attempted to carry their authority too far.</p>

<p>Lycurgus having thus tempered the government,
those that came after him thought the power of the
senate too absolute; and, therefore, as a check upon
them, they devised the authority of the Ephori.
These were five in number, and remained but one
year in office. They were all chosen out of the
people, and in that respect considerably resembled
the tribunes of the people among the Romans. Their
authority extended to the arresting and imprisoning
the persons of their kings. This institution began in
the reign of Theopompus, whose wife reproached him,
that he would leave his children the regal authority
in a worse condition than he had received it. "No!"
said he, "on the contrary, I shall leave it them in a
much better condition; as it will be more permanent
and lasting." The Spartan government then was not
purely monarchical. The nobility had a share in it,
and the people were not excluded. Each part of this
body politic, in proportion as it contributed to the
public good, found in it their advantage.</p>

<p>The second institution of Lycurgus was the division
of the lands, which he looked upon as absolutely
necessary for establishing peace and good order in
the commonwealth. The major part of the people
were so poor, that they had not one inch of land of
their own, whilst a small number of particular persons
were possessed of all the lands and wealth of
the country. In order to banish insolence, envy,
fraud, luxury, and two other distempers of the state,
still greater and more ancient than those, excessive
poverty and excessive wealth, he persuaded the citizens
to give up all their lands to the commonwealth,
and to make a new division of them.</p>

<p>This scheme, as extraordinary as it was, was immediately
executed. Lycurgus divided the lands of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
Laconia into thirty thousand parts, which he distributed
among an equal number of citizens. It is said
that, some years after, as Lycurgus was returning
from a long journey, and passing through the lands
of Laconia, in the time of harvest, and observing, as
he went along, the perfect equality of the reaped
corn, he turned towards those who were with him,
and said smilingly, "Does not Laconia look like the
possession of several brothers, who have just been
dividing their inheritance among them?"</p>

<p>After having divided their immoveables, he undertook
likewise to make the same equal division of all
their moveable goods and chattels, that he might
utterly banish all manner of equality from among
them. But perceiving that this would go against
the grain, if he went openly about it, he endeavoured
to effect it by sapping the very foundations of avarice.
For first he cried down all gold and silver
money, and ordained that no other should be current
than that of iron; which he made so very heavy, and
fixed at so low a rate, that a cart and two oxen were
necessary to carry home a sum of ten minas (about
20<i>l.</i>), and a whole chamber to keep it in.</p>

<p>Being desirous to make a yet more effectual war
upon luxury, and utterly to extirpate the love of
riches, Lycurgus made a third regulation, which
was that of public meals. That he might entirely
suppress all the magnificence and extravagance of
expensive tables, he ordained, that all the citizens
should eat together of the same common victuals,
which the law prescribed, and expressly forbade all
private eating at their own houses. The tables
consisted of about fifteen persons each; where none
could be admitted but with the consent of the whole
company. Each person furnished, every month, a
bushel of flour, eight measures of wine, five pounds
of cheese, two and a half pounds of figs, and a small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>
sum of money for preparing and cooking the food.
The very children ate at these public tables, and
were carried thither as to a school of wisdom and
temperance. Nay, they were sure to see nothing
but what tended to their instruction and entertainment.
The conversation was often enlivened with ingenious
and sprightly raillery, but never intermingled
with any thing vulgar or shocking; and if their jesting
seemed to make any person uneasy, they never
proceeded any farther. Here their children were
likewise trained up, and accustomed to great secrecy;
as soon as a young man came into the dining-room,
the oldest of the company used to say to him, pointing
to the door, "Nothing spoken here must ever go
out there."</p>

<p>Lycurgus looked upon the education of youth as
the greatest and most important object of a legislator's
care. His grand principle was, that children
belonged more to the state than to their parents;
and, therefore, he would not have them brought up
according to their humours and fancies; he would
have the state intrusted with the general care of their
education, in order to have them formed upon correct
and uniform principles, which might inspire
them betimes with the love of virtue and of their
country.</p>

<p>The most usual occupation of the Laced&aelig;monians
was hunting, and other bodily exercises. They were
forbidden to exercise any mechanic art: the Elot&aelig;,
a sort of slaves, tilled their land for them; for which
they were paid a certain revenue by way of wages.
Lycurgus would have his citizens enjoy a great deal
of leisure: they had common halls, where the people
used to meet to converse together; and though their
discourses chiefly turned upon grave and serious
topics, yet they seasoned them with a mixture of
wit and facetious humour, both agreeable and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>structive.
They passed little of their time alone;
being accustomed to live like bees, always together,
always about their chiefs and leaders. The love of
their country and of the public good was their predominant
passion; and they did not imagine they
belonged to themselves but to their country.</p>

<p>The end Lycurgus proposed was the public happiness:
convinced that the happiness of a city, like
that of a private person, depends upon virtue, and
upon being well within himself. He regulated Laced&aelig;mon
so as it might always suffice to its own
happiness, and act upon principles of wisdom and
equity. From thence arose that universal esteem of
the neighbouring people, and even of strangers, for
the Laced&aelig;monians, who asked them neither money,
ships, nor troops; but only that they should lend
them a Laced&aelig;monian to command their armies;
and when they had obtained their request, they paid
him certain obedience, with every kind of honour
and respect.</p>

<p>There were a multitude of other regulations, some
of which were, doubtless, of a very imperfect tendency;
but it is certain that the declension of Sparta
began with the violation of Lycurgus's laws. No
sooner had the ambition of reigning over all Greece
inspired them with the design of having naval armies
and foreign troops, and that money was necessary for
the support of those forces, than Laced&aelig;mon, forgetting
her ancient maxims, saw herself reduced to have
recourse to the Barbarians, which, till then, she had
detested, and basely to betray her court to the kings
of Persia, whom she had formerly vanquished with
so much glory; and that only to draw from them
some aids of money and troops against their own
brethren; that is to say, against people born and
settled in Greece, like themselves. Thus had they
the imprudence and misfortune to recal, with gold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
and silver, all the vices and crimes which the iron
money had banished; and to prepare the way to the
changes which ensued, and were the causes of their
ruin. And this infinitely exalts the wisdom of Lycurgus,
in having foreseen at such a distance what
might strike at the happiness of his citizens, and
provided salutary remedies against it in the form
of government he established at Laced&aelig;mon.</p>

<p>Ancient Sparta is thus described by Polybius:&mdash;"It
is of a circular form, and forty-eight stadia in
circumference, situated in a plain, but containing some
rough places and eminences. The Eurotas flows to
the east, and the copiousness of its waters renders it
too deep to be forded during the greater part of the
year. The hills, on which the Menelaion is situated,
are on the south-east of the city, on the opposite side
of the river. They are rugged, difficult of ascent,
and throw their shadows over the space which is
between the city and the Eurotas. The river flows
close to the foot of the hills, which are not above a
stadium and a half from the city." Its former
condition is thus described by Anacharsis:&mdash;"The
houses at Laced&aelig;mon are small, and without ornament.
Halls and porticos have been erected, to
which the citizens resort to converse together, or
transact business. On the south side of the city is
the hippodromus, or course for foot and horse races;
and at a little distance from that, the platanistas,
or place of exercise for youth, shaded by beautiful
plane-trees, and inclosed by the Eurotas on
one side, a small river which falls into it, and a
canal, by which they communicate, on the other.
It is entered by two bridges, on one of which is
the statue of Hercules, or 'All-subduing Force;'
and on the other that of Lycurgus, or 'All-regulating
Law.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span></p>

<p>In what condition is this celebrated city at present?
"Passing over the Eurotas," says Mr. Dodwell, "we
viewed the first remains of the Laced&aelig;monian capital,
now called Palaio-Kastro, consisting of uncertain
traces and heaps of large stones, tossed about in a
sort of promiscuous wreck. In a few minutes we
reached the theatre, which is of large dimensions.
The Koilon is excavated in the hill, which rose
nearly in the middle of the city, and which served
as an Acropolis. The theatre appears of Roman
construction, and the walls of the proscenium are
principally of brick. The white marble, of which,
Pausanias says, it was composed, has disappeared.
Near the theatre are the remains of a Roman brick
tower. Sparta was originally without walls, and
Lycurgus prohibited their erection. Justin asserts
that the Spartans first surrounded their capital with
walls, when Cassander entered the Peloponnesus;
according to Livy, they were built by the tyrant;
and Plutarch says they were destroyed by Philop&#339;men.
Pausanias asserts, that the walls were constructed
with precipitate haste, when Demetrius and
Pyrrhus besieged Sparta. They were afterwards
strongly fortified by the tyrant Nabis, and destroyed
by the Ach&aelig;ans, by whom, it appears, they were
afterwards rebuilt.</p>

<p>A fine sepulchral chamber, of a square form,
regularly constructed with large blocks, is situated
nearly opposite the theatre, and a short distance
from it. It has been opened, and the interior is
found to be composed of brick-work. Many other
ruins are dispersed in this direction, some of which
are of Roman origin. They appear to have suffered
more from sudden violence than from gradual decay;
and have, no doubt, been torn to pieces to supply
materials for the modern town of Misithra. Several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
inscriptions have also been found. From all this, it
will appear, that Chateaubriand is not quite correct,
when he asserts, that "<span class="smcap">Sparta</span> is occupied by the
single hut of a goat-herd, whose wealth consists in
the crop, that grows upon the graves of Agis and
Agesilaus."<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<h2><a name="NO_XLVI_LAODICEA" id="NO_XLVI_LAODICEA"></a>NO. XLVI.&mdash;LAODICEA.</h2>


<p>This city was long an inconsiderable place; but it
increased towards the age of Augustus. The fertility
of the soil, and the good fortune of some of its citizens,
raised it to greatness. Several persons bequeathed
large sums to it; amongst whom may be particularly
mentioned, Hiero, Zeno the rhetorician, and Polemo
his son. The first bequeathed it no less than 2000
talents.</p>

<p>In ancient times Laodicea collected a very considerable
revenue from its flocks of sheep, celebrated for
the fineness of their wool. "Under the reign of the
C&aelig;sars," says an elegant writer, "the proper Asia
alone contained five hundred populous cities, enriched
with all the gifts of nature, and adorned with all the
refinements of art. Eleven cities of Asia had once
disputed the honour of dedicating a temple to Tiberius,
and their respective merits were examined by the
senate. Four of them were immediately rejected, as
unequal to the burthen; and among these was
Laodicea, whose splendour is still displayed in its
ruins, and had received, a little before the contest,
a legacy of above 400,000<i>l.</i> by the testament of a
generous citizen. If such was the poverty of
Laodicea, what must have been the wealth of those
cities whose pretensions were admitted?"</p>

<p>It was first called Ramitha; but being, in process
of time, greatly embellished by Seleucus Nicator, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
took advantage of his benefaction, and called it
Laodicea in honour of his mother. C&aelig;sar afterwards
named it Juliopolis. It was in process of time
included in the empire of Saladin, conquered by
Sultan Selim, and not long after nearly destroyed by
an earthquake.</p>

<p>It was rebuilt by a Turkish Aga. "It is thus a
curiosity in its way," says a French Geography,
"being indebted for its revival to a race of people who
usually confine their exertions to the work of destruction."</p>

<p>The ruins of this city have been described by
several travellers. We shall select the details left by
Dr. Chandler and Mr. Kinneir. The first ruin, says
the former, is the remains of an amphitheatre, of an
oblong form, the area of which is about one thousand
feet in extent, with many seats remaining. At the
west end is a wide vaulted passage, about one
hundred and forty feet long, designed for the horses
and chariots; near it is an arch, with an inscription
on the mouldings, in large Greek characters, "<i>To
the Emperor Titus C&aelig;sar Augustus Vespasian, seven
times consul, son of the Emperor, the God, Vespasian;
and to the people</i>," &amp;c.</p>

<p>By another ruin is a pedestal, with an inscription:
"<i>The senate and people have honoured Tatia, daughter
of Nicostratus, son of Pericles, a new heroine, both
on account of the magistracy and ministries and
public works of her father, and on account of her
great uncle, Nicostratus, who lately, besides his other
benefactions, was priest of the city, and changed the
stadium into an amphitheatre.</i>"</p>

<p>On the north side of the amphitheatre is the ruin
of an ample edifice. In consists of many piers, and
arches of stone, with pedestals and marble fragments.
On the west side lies a large stone with an inscription:
The city "<i>has exalted Ased, a man of sanctity and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
piety, recorder for life; on account of the services he
has performed to his country</i>."</p>

<p>There are remains also of an Odeum. The seats
remain in the side of the hill. The whole was of
marble. The proscenium lies a confused heap of
ruins. Sculpture had been lavished upon it, and the
style savoured less of Grecian taste than of Roman
magnificence.</p>

<p>Beyond the Odeum are seen some marble arches,
of, it is supposed, a gymnasium. Westward are three
other marble arches, crossing a dry valley, as a
bridge. There are also traces of the city walls, with
broken columns and pieces of marble. Within, the
whole surface is filled with pedestals and columns.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Kinneir, the greatest ornament
is a triumphal arched structure, of a square plan,
between thirty and forty feet in height, and encircled
near the top with a handsome entablature. The
arches, four in number, are in the Roman style of
architecture, supposed to have been erected in honour
of C&aelig;sar, the patron of the city; or Germanicus,
who died at Daphne, and was greatly beloved by
the Syrians. The corners are adorned with handsome
pilasters of the Corinthian order, and one of its
fronts exhibits a basso-relievo with martial instruments;
hence another traveller is inclined to suppose
that it formed part of a temple dedicated to Mars.
At no great distance from this, stands a mosque,
evidently built from the ruins of another ancient
edifice, of which several columns of a portico still
stand; and amidst rocks and crags along the sea-shore
may be observed a prodigious number of small
catacombs, Dr. Shaw mentions several rows of
porphyry and granite pillars.</p>

<p>We cannot close this account without citing what
has been recently said of the inhabitants and environs
of this city:&mdash;"The environs of Ledikea having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
many olive grounds, gardens, little country retreats,
and places of pleasure, the inhabitants are all fond
of rural recreation; and those who cannot find time
for a longer excursion, seat themselves along the sides
of the public roads, both in the morning and in the
evening, to enjoy the freshness of the air, and, as
they themselves say, to lengthen out their days by

<p>This city (in B&#339;otia) is famous for having been
the scene of a great battle between the Thebans and
the Laced&aelig;monians, July 8, <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 371.</p>

<p>The two armies were very unequal in number<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>.
That of the Laced&aelig;monians consisted of twenty-four
thousand foot, and sixteen hundred horse. The Thebans
had only six thousand foot, and four hundred
horse; but all of them choice troops, animated by
their experience of the war, and determined to conquer
or die. The Laced&aelig;monian cavalry, composed
of men picked up by chance, without valour, and ill
disciplined, was as much inferior to their enemies in
courage as superior in number. The infantry could
not be depended on, except the Laced&aelig;monians; their
allies having engaged in the war with reluctance,
because they did not approve the motive of it, and
were besides dissatisfied with the Laced&aelig;monians.</p>

<p>Upon the day of battle, the two armies drew up
on a plain. Cleombrotus was upon the right, consisting
of Laced&aelig;monians, on whom he confided most.
To take the advantage which his superiority of horse
gave him in an open country, he posted them in the
front of the Laced&aelig;monians. Archidamus, Agesilaus'
son, was at the head of the allies, who formed the
left wing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span></p>

<p>The action began by the cavalry. As that of the Thebans
were better mounted, and braver troops than the
Laced&aelig;monian horse, the latter were not long before
they were broke, and driven upon the infantry, which
they put into some confusion. Epaminondas following
his horse close, marched swiftly up to Cleombrotus,
and fell upon his phalanx with all the weight of his
heavy battalion. The latter, to make a diversion,
detached a body of troops with orders to take Epaminondas
in flank, and to surround him. Pelopidas,
upon the sight of that movement, advanced with incredible
speed and boldness at the head of the second
battalion to prevent the enemy's design, and flanked
Cleombrotus himself, who, by that sudden and unexpected
attack, was put into disorder. The battle was
very rude and obstinate; and whilst Cleombrotus
could act, the victory continued in suspense, and declared
for neither party. When he fell dead with his
wounds, the Thebans, to complete the victory, and
the Laced&aelig;monians, to avoid the shame of abandoning
the body of their king, redoubled their efforts, and a
great slaughter ensued on both sides. The Spartans
fought with so much fury about the body, that at
length they gained their point, and carried it off.
Animated by so glorious an advantage, they prepared
to return to the charge, which would perhaps have
proved successful, had the allies seconded their ardour.
But the left wing, seeing the Laced&aelig;monian phalanx
had been broke, and believing all lost, especially
when they heard that the king was dead, took to
flight, and drew off the rest of the army along with
them. Epaminondas followed them vigorously, and
killed a great number in the pursuit. The Thebans
remained masters of the field of battle, erected a trophy,
and permitted the enemy to bury their dead.</p>

<p>The Laced&aelig;monians had never received such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
blow. The most bloody defeats till then had scarce
ever cost them more than four or five hundred of their
citizens. They had been seen, however, animated,
or rather violently incensed against several hundred
of their citizens, who had suffered themselves to
be shut up in the little island of Sphacteria. Here they
lost four thousand men, of whom one thousand were
Laced&aelig;monians, and four hundred Spartans, out of
seven hundred who were in the battle. The Thebans
had only three hundred men killed; among whom
were few of their citizens.</p>

<p>The city of Sparta celebrated at that time the
gymnastic games, and was full of strangers, whom
curiosity had brought thither. When the couriers
arrived from Leuctra with the terrible news of their
defeat, the Ephori, though perfectly sensible of all
the consequences, and that the Spartan empire had
received a mortal wound, would not permit the representations
of the theatre to be suspended, nor any
changes in the celebration of the festival. They sent
to every family the names of their relations who
were killed, and stayed in the theatre to see that the
dances and games were continued without interruption
to the end.</p>

<p>The next day in the morning, the loss of each
family being known, the fathers and relations of those
who had died in the battle, met in the public place,
and saluted and embraced each other with great joy
and serenity in their looks; whilst the others kept
themselves close in their houses; or, if necessity
obliged them to go abroad, it was with a sadness
and dejection of aspect, which sensibly expressed
their profound anguish and affliction. That difference
was still more remarkable in the women. Grief,
silence, tears, distinguished those who expected the
return of their sons; but such as had lost their sons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
were seen hurrying to the temples, to thank the gods,
and congratulating each other upon their glory and
good fortune<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>.</p>

<p>All that remains of this city, so celebrated and so
universally known by the battle just described,
and in which the Laced&aelig;monians forfeited for ever
the empire of Greece, after possessing it for three
centuries, are a few remains near the village of Parapongi,
and a few blocks of stone<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="NO_XLVIII_MAGNESIA" id="NO_XLVIII_MAGNESIA"></a>NO. XLVIII.&mdash;MAGNESIA.</h2>


<p>This city, situate on the M&aelig;ander, about fifteen
miles <span class="smcap">S. E.</span> of Ephesus, was founded by a colony from
Magnesia in Thrace, united with the Cretans. It
was one of the cities given to Themistocles by the
king of Persia. The Turks call it "Guzel-Hisar,"
or the beautiful castle.</p>

<p>A great battle was fought here between the
Romans and Antiochus, king of Syria. The forces
of the former consisted of thirty thousand men; those
of Antiochus to seventy thousand foot and twelve
thousand horse. The Syrians lost fifty thousand
foot and four thousand horse; and the Romans only
three hundred foot and twenty-five horse. This disproportion
of loss, however, is incredible.</p>

<p>Magnesia is rendered remarkable by the circumstance
of its having been, as we have before stated,
the place assigned by Artaxerxes for the residence of
Themistocles. The whole revenues of the city, as
well as those of Lampsacus and Myunte, were settled
upon him<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>. One of the cities was to furnish him
with bread, another with wine, and a third with
other provisions<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>.</p>

<p>The temple of Diana at Magnesia was constructed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
under the direction of Hermogenes, of whom Vitruvius
speaks with great veneration.</p>

<p>"The situation of Magnesia," says Pococke, "is
delightful; for it commands a view of the fine plain
of the M&aelig;ander, which is broad towards the west.
The view extends to the sea, and from the height I
saw the Agathonisa islands, which are near Patmos.
Mount Thorax to the north is covered with snow.
What adds to the prospect, is a most beautiful inclosed
country to the south and west, and the fields
are planted with the fig and almond trees. The
modern city, also, adds to the beauty of the view;
which being large, and there being courts and gardens
to the houses, improved by cypress and orange trees,
and some of the streets planted with trees, it makes
it appear like a city in a wood."</p>

<p>Chandler visited this place in 1774. According to
him, Magnesia surrendered to the Romans immediately
after the decisive battle between Scipio and
Antiochus. It was a free city in the time of Tiberius.
It was selected as a place of security, in 1303,
by the Emperor Michael, who at length was compelled
to escape from it in the night. In 1313 it
ranked among the acquisitions of Sarkhan, afterwards
sultan of Ionia. In 1443, Amurath II. selected it
as a place of retreat, when he resigned his empire to
his son Mahomet II.</p>

<p>There are signs of many great buildings all over
the city; but they are ruined in such a manner, that,
except two or three, it is difficult to judge of what
nature they were. Pococke speaks, however, of there
having been in his time very great ruins to the east,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
which appeared to be remains of some "magnificent
large palace." On the north, too, he observed the
ruins of a very grand temple, which he thinks must
have belonged to that of Diana Leucophryne, the
largest in Asia after the temples of Ephesus and
Didymi; and though it yielded to that of Ephesus in
its riches, yet it exceeded it in its proportions, and in
the exquisiteness of its architecture.</p>

<p>In the Ionic temple<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> at Magnesia, designed by
that Hermogenes whose merits are highly extolled
by Vitruvius, the general dimensions are the same as
the dipteros; but having, in order to obtain free
space under the flank porticoes, omitted the inner
range of columns, he thereby established the pseudo-dipteros;
but unless he continued the wooden beams
of the roof over the increased space, this mode was
impracticable, unless when the quarries afforded
marble of very large dimensions.</p>

<p>A Persian writer says of this place:&mdash;"It is
situated at the skirt of a mountain; and its running
streams afford water of the utmost purity; and its
air, even in winter, is more delightful than the breath
of spring<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>."</p>

<h2><a name="XLIX_MANTINEA" id="XLIX_MANTINEA"></a>XLIX.&mdash;MANTINEA.</h2>


<p>A city of the Peloponnesus, well known for a
famous battle fought near it between the Laced&aelig;monians
and Thebans. The Greeks had never fought
among themselves with more numerous armies. The
Laced&aelig;monians consisted of twenty thousand foot,
and two thousand horse; the Thebans of thirty thousand
foot, and three thousand horse.</p>

<p>The Theban general, Epaminondas, marched in the
same order of battle in which he intended to fight,
that he might not be obliged, when he came up with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
the enemy, to lose, in the disposition of his army,
a time which cannot be too much saved in great
enterprises<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>.</p>

<p>He did not march directly, and with his front to
the enemy, but in a column upon the hills, with his
left wing foremost, as if he did not intend to fight
that day. When he was over against them at a
quarter of a league's distance, he made his troops
halt and lay down their arms, as if he designed to
encamp there. The enemy in effect were deceived by
that stand; and reckoning no longer upon a battle,
they quitted their arms, dispersed themselves about
the camp, and suffered that ardour to extinguish,
which the near approach of a battle is wont to kindle
in the hearts of the soldiers. Epaminondas, however,
by suddenly wheeling his troops to the right,
having changed his column into a line, and having
drawn out the choicest troops, whom he had expressly
posted in front upon his march, he made them
double their files upon the front of his left wing, to
add to its strength, and to put it into a condition to
attack in a point the Laced&aelig;monian phalanx, which,
by the movement he had made, faced it directly.</p>

<p>He expected to decide the victory by that body of
chosen troops which he commanded in person, and
which he had formed in a column to attack the enemy
in a point like a galley, says Xenophon. He assured
himself, that if he could penetrate the Laced&aelig;monian
phalanx, in which the enemy's principal force consisted,
he should not find it difficult to rout the rest
of their army, by charging upon the right and left.</p>

<p>After having disposed his whole army in this
manner, he moved on to charge the enemy with the
whole weight of his column. They were strangely
surprised when they saw Epaminondas advance towards
them in this order, and resumed their arms,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
bridled their horses, and made all the haste they
could to their ranks.</p>

<p>Whilst Epaminondas marched against the enemy,
the cavalry that covered his flank on the left, the
best at that time in Greece, entirely composed of
Thebans and Thessalians, had orders to attack the
enemy's horse. The Theban general, whom nothing
escaped, had artfully bestowed bowmen, slingers and
dartmen, in the intervals of his horse, in order to
begin the disorder of the enemy's cavalry, by a previous
discharge of a shower of arrows, stones, and
javelins, upon them. The other army had neglected
to take the same precaution, and had made another
fault, not less considerable, in giving as much depth
to the squadrons as if they had been a phalanx. By
this means their horse were incapable of supporting
long the charge of the Thebans. After having made
several ineffectual attacks with great loss, they were
obliged to retire behind their infantry.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Epaminondas, with his body of
foot, had charged the Laced&aelig;monian phalanx. The
troops fought on both sides with incredible ardour;
both the Thebans and Laced&aelig;monians being resolved
to perish rather than yield the glory of arms to their
rivals. They began by fighting with the spear; and
those first arms being soon broken in the fury of the
combat, they charged each other sword in hand. The
resistance was equally obstinate, and the slaughter
very great on both sides.</p>

<p>The furious slaughter on both sides having continued
a great while without the victory's inclining to
either, Epaminondas, to force it to declare for him,
thought it his duty to make an extraordinary effort
in person, without regard to the danger of his own
life. He formed, therefore, a troop of the bravest
and most determined about him, and putting himself
at the head of them, he made a vigorous charge upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
the enemy, where the battle was most warm, and
wounded the general of the Laced&aelig;monians with the
first javelin he threw. His troop, by his example,
having wounded or killed all that stood in their way,
broke and penetrated the phalanx. The gross of the
Theban troops, animated by their general's example
and success, drove back the enemy upon his right and
left, and made a great slaughter of them. But some
troops of the Spartans, perceiving that Epaminondas
abandoned himself too much to his ardour, suddenly
rallied, and returning to the fight, charged him with
a shower of javelins. Whilst he kept off part of
those darts, shunned some of them, fenced off others,
and was fighting with the most heroic valour, to
assure the victory to his army, a Spartan, named
Callicrates, gave him a mortal wound with a javelin
in the breast across his cuirass. The wood of the
javelin being broken off, and the iron head continuing
in the wound, the torment was insupportable, and
he fell immediately. The battle began around him
with new fury; the one side using their utmost
endeavours to take him alive, and the other to save
him. The Thebans gained their point at last, and
carried him off, after having put the enemy to flight.</p>

<p>Epaminondas was carried into the camp. The
surgeons, after having examined the wound, declared
that he would expire as soon as the head of the dart
was drawn out of it. Those words gave all that were
present the utmost sorrow and affliction, who were
inconsolable on seeing so great a man about to die,
and to die without issue. For him, the only concern
he expressed, was about his arms, and the success of
the battle. When they showed him his shield, and
assured him that the Thebans had gained the victory;
turning towards his friends with a calm and serene
air; "Do not regard," said he, "this day as the end
of my life, but as the beginning of my happiness, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
the completion of my glory. I leave Thebes triumphant,
proud Sparta humbled, and Greece delivered
from the yoke of servitude. For the rest, I do not
reckon that I die without issue; Leuctra and Mantinea
are two illustrious daughters, that will not fail
to keep my name alive, and to transmit it to posterity."
Having spoken to this effect, he drew the head of the
javelin out of his wound, and expired.</p>

<p>Mantinea is also famous for another great battle,
viz., that between Philop&#339;men and Machanidas,
tyrant of Sparta<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>. The time for beginning the battle
approaching and the enemy in view, Philop&#339;men,
flying up and down the ranks of the infantry, encouraged
his men in few but very strong expressions.
Most of them were even not heard; but he was so
dear to his soldiers, and they reposed such confidence
in him, that they wanted no exhortations to fight
with incredible ardour. In a kind of transport they
animated their general, and pressed him to lead them
on to battle.</p>

<p>Machanidas marched his infantry in a kind of
column, as if he intended to begin the battle by charging
the right wing; but when he was advanced to a
proper distance, he on a sudden made his infantry
wheel about, in order that it might extend to his
right, and make a front equal to the left of the
Ach&aelig;ans; and, to cover it, he caused all the chariots
laden with catapults to advance forward. Philop&#339;men
plainly saw that his intention was to break his
infantry, by overwhelming it with darts and stones:
however, he did not give him time for it. The first
charge was very furious. The light-armed soldiers
advancing a little after to sustain them, in a moment
the foreign troops were universally engaged on both
sides; and, as in this attack they fought man to man,
the battle was a long time doubtful. At last the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
foreigners in the tyrant's army had the advantage;
their numbers and dexterity, acquired by experience,
giving them the superiority. The Illyrians and
cuirassiers, who sustained the foreign soldiers in Philop&#339;men's
army, could not withstand so furious a
charge. They were entirely broken, and fled with the
utmost precipitation towards Mantinea, about a mile
from the field of battle.</p>

<p>Philop&#339;men seemed now lost to all hopes. "On
this occasion," says Polybius, "appeared the truth of
a maxim, which cannot reasonably be contested, That
the events of war are generally successful or unfortunate,
only in proportion to the skill or ignorance of
the generals who command in them. Philop&#339;men, so
far from desponding at the ill success of the first
charge, or being in confusion, was solely intent upon
taking advantage of the errors which the enemy
might commit." Accordingly, they were guilty of a
great one. Machanidas, after the left wing was
routed, instead of improving that advantage, by
charging in front that instant with his infantry the
centre of that of the enemies, and taking it at the
same time in flank with his victorious wing, and
thereby terminating the whole affair, suffers himself,
like a young man, to be hurried away by the fire and
impetuosity of his soldiers, and pursues, without order
or discipline, those who were flying.</p>

<p>Philop&#339;men, who had retired to his infantry in
the centre, takes the first cohorts, commands them to
wheel to the left, and at their head marches and seizes
the post which Machanidas had abandoned. By this
movement he divided the centre of the enemies'
infantry from his right wing. He then commanded
these cohorts to stay in the post they had just seized,
till further orders; and at the same time directed a
Megalapolitan to rally all the Illyrians, cuirassiers,
and foreigners, who, without quitting their ranks, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
flying as the rest had done, had drawn off, to avoid
the fury of the conqueror; and with these forces to
post himself on the flank of the infantry in his centre,
to check the enemy in their return from the pursuit.</p>

<p>This Megalapolitan was named Polyinus; but not
the historian, as many writers have imagined.</p>

<p>The Laced&aelig;monian infantry, elated with the first
success of their wing, without waiting for the signal,
advanced with their pikes lowered towards the
Ach&aelig;ans, as far as the brink of the ditch. This was the
decisive point of time for which Philop&#339;men had long
waited, and thereupon he ordered the charge to be
sounded. His troops levelling their pikes, fell with
dreadful shouts on the Lacedemonians. These, who
at their descending into the ditch, had broken their
ranks, no sooner saw the enemy above them, but
immediately fled.</p>

<p>To complete the glory of this action, the business
now was to prevent the tyrant from escaping the
conqueror. This was Philop&#339;men's only object.
Machanidas, on his return, perceived that his army
fled; when, being sensible of his error, he endeavoured,
but in vain, to force his way through the Ach&aelig;ans.
His troops, perceiving that the enemy were masters
of the bridge which lay over the ditch, were quite
dispirited, and endeavoured to save themselves as well
as they could. Machanidas himself, finding it impossible
to pass the bridge, hurried along the side of the
ditch, in order to find a place for getting over it.
Philop&#339;men knew him by his purple mantle, and the
trappings of his horse: so he passed the ditch, in order
to stop the tyrant. The latter having found a part of
the ditch which might easily be crossed, clapped spurs
to his horse, and sprang forward in order to leap over.
That very instant Philop&#339;men threw his javelin at
him, which laid him dead in the ditch. The tyrant's
head being struck off, and carried from rank to rank,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
gave new courage to the victorious Ach&aelig;ans. They
pursued the fugitives with incredible ardour as far as
Tegea, entered the city with them, and, being now
masters of the field, the very next day they encamped
on the banks of the Eurotas. The Ach&aelig;ans did not
lose many men in this battle, but the Lacedemonians
lost four thousand, without including the prisoners,
who were still more numerous. The baggage and
arms were also taken by the Ach&aelig;ans.</p>

<p>The conquerors, struck with admiration at the
conduct of their general, to whom the victory was
entirely owing, erected a brazen statue to him in the
same attitude in which he had killed the tyrant;
which statue they afterwards placed in the temple
of Apollo at Delphos.</p>

<p>Mantinea<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> was richly decorated with public edifices.
It had eight temples, besides a theatre, a stadium,
and hippodrome, and several other monuments;
many of which are enumerated by Pausanias.</p>

<p>Some imperfect remains of the theatre are still
visible; the walls of which resemble those round the
town. But none of the sites of the temples or of
the other structures can be identified; and everything,
except the walls which enclose the city, is in
a state of total dilapidation.</p>

<p>These walls were composed of unbaked bricks, which
resisted, even better than stone, the impulse of warlike
engines; but were not proof against the effects of
water. For one of the kings of Sparta, forming a ditch
round the town, and carrying the river Ophis to flow
into it, dissolved the fabric of the walls. They enclose
a circle, in which the city stood. They are
fortified with towers, most of which are square;
others are of circular forms. The whole exhibits an
interesting and very perfect example of Grecian
fortification. There were eight gates; not one of which,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
however, retains its lintel. The walls are surrounded
by a fosse, which is still supplied by the Ophis<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="NO_L_MARATHON" id="NO_L_MARATHON"></a>NO. L.&mdash;MARATHON.</h2>


<p>Marathon, which was originally one of the four
cities, founded by an Attic king, who gave it his
name, is now little better than a village. The plain
in which it is situated is, says Mr. Dodwell, "one
of the prettiest spots in Attica, and is enriched with
many kinds of fruit-trees: particularly walnuts, figs,
pomegranates, pears, and cherries. On our arrival,
the fine country girls, with attractive looks and
smiling faces, brought us baskets of fruit. Some of
them appeared unwilling to accept our money in
return; and the spontaneous civility and good-humour
of the inhabitants soon convinced us that we were in
Attica, where they are more courteous to strangers
than in other parts of Greece."</p>

<p>This city was but a small one, indeed it was often
called a village; yet a deathless interest is attached
to it; for just beside it was fought the battle between
the Persians and the Athenians, which is, even at
this day, more known and respected than any other
recorded in history. We shall, therefore, give an
abstract of the account of the battle, as it is stated in
Rollin, and then show in what condition the city is
at the present time.</p>

<p>Miltiades, like an able captain, endeavoured, by
the advantage of the ground, to gain what he wanted
in strength and number. He drew up his army at
the foot of a mountain, that the enemy should not be
able to surround him, or charge him in the rear.
On the two sides of his army he caused large trees
to be cut and thrown down, in order to cover his
flanks, and render the Persian cavalry useless. Datis,
their commander, was sensible that the place was
not advantageous for him: but, relying upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
number of his troops, which was infinitely superior
to that of the Athenians, he determined to
engage. The Athenians did not wait for the enemy's
charging them. As soon as the signal for battle was
given, they ran against the enemy with all the fury
imaginable. The Persians looked upon this first step
of the Athenians as a piece of madness, considering
their army was so small, and utterly destitute both
of cavalry and archers; but they were quickly undeceived.
Herodotus observes, that "this was the
first time the Grecians began an engagement by running
in this manner." The battle was fierce and
obstinate. Miltiades had made the wings of his
army exceedingly strong, but had left the main body
more weak, and not deep; the reason of which
seems manifest enough. Having but ten thousand
men to oppose to such a numerous army, it was
impossible for him either to make a large front, or
to give an equal depth to his battalion. He was
therefore obliged to take his choice; and he imagined
that he could gain the victory in no other way than
by the efforts he should make with his two wings,
in order to break and disperse those of the Persians;
not doubting, but when his wings were once victorious,
they should be able to attack the enemy's
main body in flank, and complete the victory without
much difficulty.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> The Persians then attacked
the main body of the Grecian army, and made their
greatest effort particularly upon their front. This
was led by Aristides and Themistocles, who supported
it a long time with an intrepid courage and
bravery, but were at length obliged to give ground.
At that very instant came up their two victorious
wings, which had dispersed those of the enemy, and
put them to flight. Nothing could be more season<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>able
for the main body of the Grecian army, which
began to be broken, being quite borne down by the
number of the Persians. The scale was quickly
turned, and the barbarians were entirely routed.
They all betook themselves to their heels and fled;
not towards their camp, but to their ships, that they
might escape. The Athenians pursued them thither,
and set their ships on fire. They took, also, seven of
their ships. They had not above two hundred men
killed on their side in this engagement; whereas, on
the side of the Persians, above six thousand were
slain, without reckoning those who fell into the sea,
as they endeavoured to escape, or those that were
consumed with the ships set on fire. Immediately
after the battle, an Athenian soldier, still reeking
with the blood of the enemy, quitted the army, and
ran to Athens to carry his fellow-citizens the happy
news of the victory. When he arrived at the
magistrate's house, he only uttered two or three
words:&mdash;"Rejoice, rejoice, the victory is ours!" and
fell down dead at their feet.</p>

<p>In an excavation, made in one of the tumuli, some
years ago, were found a number of busts;&mdash;of Socrates,
Lucius Verus, and Marcus Aurelius, with another
of an unknown person, sculptured with great care, and
happily finished.</p>

<p>The unknown bust is supposed to be that of
Herodes Atticus, a native of this city, and greatly
distinguished. His history is exceedingly curious.
We take it from Sir George Wheler.</p>

<p>"He flourished about the time of the emperors
Trajan, Adrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius.
His grandfather Hipparchus, or as Suidas
has it, Plutarchus, was well to pass in the world,
but having been accused of some tyrannical practices,
used towards the people, the emperor confiscated
all his estates; so that his son, Atticus, father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
of this Herod; lived afterwards in Athens in a mean
condition; until, having found a great hidden treasure
in his own house, near the theatre, he became
on a sudden very rich. He was not more fortunate
in lending it, than prudent in getting it confirmed
on himself; for well knowing, should it come to be
discovered, he should be obliged to give an account
of it to the emperor, he wrote thus:&mdash;'My liege,
I have found a treasure in my house; what do you
command that I should do with it?' The emperor
answered him, 'That he should make use of what he
had found.' But Atticus, yet fearing that he might
be in danger of some trouble, when the greatness
of the treasure should come to be known, wrote a
second time to the emperor, professing ingenuously,
that the treasure he had written to him about was too
great a possession for him, and exceeded the capacity
of a private man. But the emperor answered him
again with the same generosity, 'Abuse, also, if
thou wilt, the riches thou hast so accidentally come
by; for they are thine.' By this means, Atticus
became again extremely rich and powerful, having
married a wife also that was very rich, whence it
came to pass that his son and heir Herodes far
surpassed his father both in wealth and magnificence,
and became the founder of many stately
edifices in sundry parts of Greece; and, dying, left
by his will ten crowns to every citizen of Athens.
Neither did he partake less of virtue and merit
than he did of fortune; being very learned, and so
eloquent, that he was called the tongue of Athens;
having been the disciple of the famous Phavorinus.
Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, emperors of
his time, made it their glory that they had been
his auditors. His entire name was Tiberius Claudius
Atticus Herodes; as I prove by an inscription
that is at Athens, in the house of Signor Nicoli<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
Limbonia."&mdash;Thus far, Sir George Wheler. Chandler
goes on to observe, that Herodes Atticus directed
his freed-men to bury him at Marathon; where he
died, at the age of seventy-six. But the Ephebi,
or young men of Athens, transported his body on
their shoulders to the city, a multitude meeting the
bier, and weeping like children for the loss of a
parent.</p>

<p>The antiquities of this plain resolve themselves
into the tomb of the Athenians, the monument
of Miltiades, and the tomb of the Plat&aelig;ans. Dr.
Clarke found also many interesting relics, for an
account of which we must refer to his Travels, in
order that we may find space for some beautiful
remarks, with which he closes his very agreeable
account. "If there be a spot upon earth, pre-eminently
calculated to awaken the solemn sentiments,
which such a view of nature is fitted to make upon
all men, it may surely be found in the plain of
Marathon; where, amidst the wreck of generations,
and the graves of ancient heroes, we elevate our
thoughts towards <span class="smcap">Him</span>, 'in whose sight a thousand
years are but as yesterday;' where the stillness of
Nature, harmonizing with the calm solitude of that
illustrious region, which once was a scene of the most
agitated passions, enables us, by the past, to determine
of the future. In those moments, indeed, we
may be said to live for ages;&mdash;a single instant, by
the multitude of impressions it conveys, seems to
anticipate for us a sense of that eternity 'when
time shall be no more;' when the fitful dream of
human existence, with all its turbulent illusions,
shall be dispelled; and the last sun having set, in
the last of the world, a brighter dawn than ever
gladdened the universe, shall renovate the dominions
of darkness and of death."<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<h2><a name="NO_LI_MEGALOPOLIS" id="NO_LI_MEGALOPOLIS"></a>NO. LI.&mdash;MEGALOPOLIS.</h2>


<p>This city, situated in Arcadia, had one of the most
illustrious persons of ancient times for its founder,
Epaminondas. Its population was collected from
various small cities and towns of Arcadia.</p>

<p>Soon after its establishment, the inhabitants sent
to Plato for a code of laws. The philosopher was
much pleased with so flattering an offer; but he
ultimately declined sending them one, because he
learned from a disciple, whom he had sent to Megalopolis,
that the inhabitants would never consent to
an equality of property.</p>

<p>In 232 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, Megalopolis joined the Achaian
league, and was taken and ruined by Cleomenes.
At that period it was as large a city as Sparta. Its
most valuable paintings and sculptures were conveyed
to the Laconian capital, and great part of the city
destroyed.</p>

<p>The Athenians, soon after, beginning to see the
impropriety of not keeping up the balance of power
in Greece, Demosthenes signalised himself greatly in
endeavouring to persuade them to take part with the
Megalopolitans. "It has been a perpetual maxim
with us," said he, "to assist the oppressed against
the oppressor. We have never varied from this principle.
The reproach of changing, therefore, ought
not to fall upon us, but upon those whose injustice
and usurpation oblige us to declare against them."</p>

<p>"I admire the language of politicians," says Rollin.
"To hear them talk, it is always reason and the strictest
justice that determine them; but to see them act,
makes it evident that interest and ambition are the
sole rule and guide of their conduct. Their discourse
is an effect of that regard for justice, which nature
has implanted on the mind of man, and which they
cannot entirely shake off. There are few that venture
to declare against that internal principle in their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
expressions, or to contradict it openly. But there are
also few who observe it with fidelity and constancy
in their actions. Greece never was known to have
more treaties of alliance than at the time we are now
speaking of, nor were they ever less regarded. This
contempt of religion, of oaths in states, is a proof of
their decline, and often denotes and occasions their
approaching ruin." The Athenians, moved by the
eloquent discourse of Demosthenes, sent three thousand
foot and three hundred horse to the aid of Pamanes.
Megalopolis was reinstated in its former
condition; and the inhabitants, who had retired into
their own countries, were obliged to return.</p>

<p>Anacharsis, from whose travels we have gleaned
so many interesting anecdotes, says:&mdash;"A small
river, called the Helisson, divides the city into two
parts, in both of which houses and public edifices
have been built, and are still building. That to the
north contains a tower, enclosed by a stone balustrade,
and surrounded by some edifices and porticoes.
A superb bronze statue of Apollo, twelve feet high,
has been erected facing the temple of Jupiter. This
statue is a present from the Philagians, who contributed
with pleasure to the embellishments of the
new city. Some private individuals have done the
same. One of the porticoes bears the name of Aristander,
who caused it to be built at his own expense.
In the part to the south we saw a spacious edifice,
in which is held the assembly of the ten thousand
deputies, appointed to conduct the important affairs
of the state. The city contains a great number of
statues; among others, we saw the work of two
Athenian artists, Cephisodorus and Xenophon, consisting
of a group, in which Jupiter is represented,
seated on a throne, with the city of Megalopolis in
his right hand, and Diana Conservatrix on his left.
The marble of which it is made is the production of
the quarries of Mount Pentelicus, near Athens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span></p>

<p>The theatre at Megalopolis was the largest in
Greece. The circular part still remains; but the
seats are covered with earth and overgrown with
bushes. Part of the walls of the proscenium are also
seen facing the Helisson, a small but rapid river,
which flows a few yards to the east.</p>

<p>The remains of the temples are dubious; some
masses of walls and scattered blocks of columns
indicate their situations; without indicating the
divinities to whose worship they were consecrated.
The soil being much raised, Mr. Dodwell thinks that
it may conceal several remains of the city.</p>

<p>There are several other ruins at the distance of a
few miles from Megalopolis, which recent travellers
have not been able to visit on account of the troubles
which have lately prevailed in almost every part of
the Morea<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="NO_LII_MEGARA" id="NO_LII_MEGARA"></a>NO. LII.&mdash;MEGARA.</h2>


<p>Megara, a city of Achaia, formerly possessed
such a multitude of objects for a stranger to see, that
Pausanias, in his description of Greece, occupies no
less than six chapters in the mere enumeration of
them.</p>

<p>Megara was founded 1131 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> It is situate at
an equal distance from Athens and Corinth, and is
built on two rocks. Its founder has been variously
stated. Some have insisted that it was called after
Megareus, the son of Apollo; some after Megarius, a
B&#339;otian chief; and others after Megara, a supposed
wife of Hercules. However this may be, certain,
we believe, it is, that, under the reign of Codrus, the
Peloponnesians having declared war against the Athenians,
and miscarried in their enterprise, returned
and took possession of Megara, which they peopled
with Corinthians. It was originally governed by
twelve kings, but afterwards became a republic. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
ancient Megareans are said to have excelled in nothing
but naval affairs. They were reckoned the
worst people of Greece, and were generally detested
as fraudulent and perfidious<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>. Their military acts
were few, and not brilliant. They were bandied about
by the Athenians and Corinthians, and had all the
bad qualities of insolent slaves, or servile and dependent
friends. Such having been the case, we are
not surprised at what Tertullian says of the Megareans;
viz., that they ate as if they were to die the
next day, and built as if they were to live for ever.
Megara, however, was not without some redeeming
qualities, for it had at one time a school for philosophy,
so highly distinguished, that Euclid was at
the head of it.</p>

<p>Megara has been greatly distinguished from the
circumstance of Phocion having been buried in its
territories. The enemies of Phocion, not satisfied
with the punishment they had caused him to suffer,
and believing some particulars were still wanting to
complete their triumph, obtained an order from the
people, that his body should be carried out of the
dominions of Attica, and that none of the Athenians
should contribute the least quantity of wood to
honour his funeral pile: these last offices were therefore
rendered to him in the territories of <i>Megara</i>. A
lady of the country, who accidentally assisted at his
funeral with her servants, caused a cenotaph, or
vacant tomb, to be erected to his memory on the
same spot; and, collecting into her robe the bones of
that great man, which she had carefully gathered up,
she conveyed them into her house by night, and
buried them under her hearth, with these expressions:
"Dear and sacred hearth, I here confide to
thee, and deposit in thy bosom, these precious
remains of a worthy man. Preserve them with fidelity,
in order to restore them hereafter to the monu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>ment
of his ancestors, when the Athenians shall
become wiser than they are at present."</p>

<p>Megara still retains it name: it has been greatly
infested by corsairs; insomuch that in 1676, the inhabitants
were accustomed, on seeing a boat approaching
in the daytime, or hearing their dogs bark by
night, immediately to secrete their effects and run
away. The Vaiwode, who lived in a forsaken tower,
above the village, was once carried off.</p>

<p>Besides two citadels, Megara had several magnificent
structures and ornaments. One was an aqueduct,
distinguished for its grandeur and beauty;
another for a statue of Diana, the protectress; and
to these were added statues of the twelve great gods,
of so much excellence, that they were ascribed to
Praxiteles;&mdash;a group, consecrated to Jupiter Olympius,
in which was a statue of that deity, with its
face of gold and ivory, and the rest of the body of
burnt earth. There were also a temple of Bacchus,
and another of Venus; a third of Ceres, a fourth of
Apollo, a fifth of Diana, and a sixth of Minerva; in
which last was a statue of the goddess, the body of
which was gilt, and the face, feet, and hands of
ivory. There was, also, a chapel dedicated to the
Night. Pausanias speaks, also, of several tombs;
especially those of Hyllus, Alcmenes, Therea, and
Hippolyta, queen of the Amazons.</p>

<p>In Wheler's time, Megara was a collection of pitiful
cottages, whose walls were sometimes only the
broken stones of her ruins, or clay dried in the sun,
covered only with faggots; and these again spread
over with earth above them<sup>*</sup>.</p>

<p>Chandler describes the site of Megara as covered
with rubbish, amongst which were standing some
ruinous churches; some pieces of ancient wall, on
which a modern fortress has been erected. The village
consisting of low, mean cottages, pleasantly
situated on the slope of an eminence, indented in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>middle. Nearly the whole site of the ancient city
he found green with corn, and marked by heaps of
stones, and the rubbish of buildings. A few inscriptions,
too, were seen: one of which relates to Herodes
Atticus, signalising the gratitude of the Megareans,
for his benefactions and good will. There was
another on a stone:&mdash;"<i>This, too, is the work of the
most magnificent Count Diogenes, the son of Archelaus,
who, regarding the Grecian cities as his own
family, has bestowed on that of the Megarensians 100
pieces of gold towards the building of their towers;
and also 150 more, with 2200 feet of marble, toward
re-edifying the bath; deeming nothing more honourable
than to do good to the Greeks, and to restore their
cities.</i>"</p>

<p>The person here signalised was one of the generals
of the emperor Anastasius, who employed him on a
rebellion in Isauria, <small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 494.</p>

<p>Wheler also gives an inscription in "honour of
Callimachus, Scribe and Gymnasiarch," and several
others. Dr. Clarke also saw one, setting forth that,
"<i>under the care of Julius, the proconsul, and the
pr&aelig;torship of Aiscron, this (monument or statue) is
raised by the Adrianid&aelig; to Adrian</i>."</p>

<p>Several other inscriptions have been found; one in
honour of the Empress Sabina; and others in praise
of Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. There is
another, too, in honour of a person, who had been
several times conqueror in almost all the public games
in Greece and Italy. There was, also (formerly),
another inscription, still more honourable. This was
on the tomb of a person named Chor&aelig;bus, in which
was related, in elegiac verse, the history of his
having devoted himself to death, in order to free
his native country (Thebes) from the evils of a
pestilence<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span></p>

<p>The Earl of Sandwich mentions two statues of
women, about eight feet high, without heads; and
having no attributes to show for what they were
designed.</p>

<p>Clarke says, that Ionic and Doric capitals, some
of which are of limestone, and others of marble,
lie scattered among the ruins, and in the courts of
some of the houses. He procured, also, a few fragments
of terra-cotta, of a bright red hue, beautifully
fluted.</p>

<p>Chandler speaks of the remains of a temple of
Minerva, near a large basin of water; on the sides
of which are the remains of a bath, remarkable for
its size and ornaments, and for the number of its
columns.</p>

<p>The stone of Megara was of a kind unknown any
where else in Hellas; very white, and consisting
entirely of cockle shells; which, not being hard, may
be reckoned among the causes of the destruction of
Megara.</p>

<p>Another cause of destruction may be supposed to
have originated in its locality; it being the great road
leading to and from the peninsula, as well as its
immediate situation between the two powerful enemies,&mdash;the
Athenians and Corinthians,&mdash;with whom
the Megareans had frequent contests concerning the
boundaries of their respective territories. If its
situation, however, was the cause of its destruction,
it was, also, the one great cause of its consequence<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>.</p>

<p>Megara is well known from the following anecdote.
The city of <i>Megara</i> being taken by Demetrius,
the soldiers demanded leave to plunder
the inhabitants; but the Athenians interceded for
them so effectually, that the city was saved. Stilpon,
a celebrated philosopher, lived in that city, and
was visited by Demetrius, who asked him if he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
lost any thing?&mdash;"Nothing at all," replied Stilpon,
"for I carry all my effects about me;" meaning by
that expression, his justice, probity, temperance, and
wisdom; with the advantage of not ranking any
thing in the class of blessings that could be taken
from him<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>.</p>

<p>There are said to be in Upper Egypt thirty-four
temples, still in existence, and five palaces. The most
ancient have been constructed chiefly of sand-stone,
and a few with calcareous stone. Granite was only
used in obelisks and colossal statues. After the seat
of empire was removed to Memphis, granite was
made use of.</p>

<p>Memphis, according to Herodotus, was built (eight
generations after Thebes) by Menes; but Diodorus
attributes its origin to Uchoreus, one of the successors
of Osymandyas, king of Thebes. To reconcile
this want of agreement, some authors ascribe
the commencement to Menes, and its completion and
aggrandisement to Uchoreus, who first made it a
royal city.</p>

<p>The occasion of its having been erected, is thus
stated<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>:&mdash;A king of Egypt having turned the
course of the Nile, which diffused itself over the sands
of Lybia, and the Delta being formed from the mud
of its waters, canals were cut to drain Lower Egypt.
The monarchs, who till then had resided at Thebes,
removed nearer the mouth of the river, to enjoy an
air more temperate, and be more ready to defend the
entrance of their empire. They founded the city of
Memphis, and endeavoured to render it equal to the
ancient capital; decorating it with many temples,
among which that of Vulcan drew the attention of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
travellers: its grandeur and sumptuousness of rich
ornaments, each excited admiration. Another temple
beside the barren plain was dedicated to Serapis,
the principal entrance to which had a sphinx avenue.
Egypt has always been oppressed with sands, which,
accumulating here, half buried some of the sphinxes,
and others up to the neck, in the time of Strabo; at
present they have disappeared. To prevent this disaster,
they built a large mound on the south side,
which also served as a barrier against the inundations
of the river, and the encroachments of the
enemy. The palace of the kings and a fortress built
on the mountain, defended it on the west; the Nile
on the east; and to the north were the lakes, beyond
which were the plain of mummies, and the causeway
which led from Busiris to the great pyramids.
Thus situated, Memphis commanded the valley of
Egypt, and communicated by canals with the lakes
M&#339;ris and Mareotis. Its citizens might traverse
the kingdom in boats; and it therefore became
the centre of wealth, commerce, and arts; where
geometry, invented by the Egyptians, flourished.
Hither the Greeks came to obtain knowledge, which,
carrying into their own country, they brought to
perfection. Thebes, and her hundred gates, lay forgotten,
and on the hill near Memphis, rose those
proud monuments, those superb mausoleums, which
alone, of all the Wonders of the World, have braved
destructive time, and men still more destructive.</p>

<p>Strabo says, that in this city there were many
palaces, situated along the side of a hill, stretching
down to lakes and groves, forty stadia from the city.
"The principal deities of Memphis," says Mr.
Wilkinson, "were Pthah, Apis, and Butastis; and
the goddess Isis had a magnificent temple in this
city, erected by Amasis, who also dedicated a recumbent
colossus, seventy-five feet long, in the temple of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
Pthah or Vulcan. This last was said to have been
founded by Menes, and was enlarged and beautified
by succeeding monarchs. M&#339;ris erected the northern
vestibule; and Sesostris, besides the colossal statues,
made considerable additions with enormous blocks of
stone, which he employed his prisoners of war to
drag to the temple. Pheron, his son, also enriched
it with suitable presents, on the recovery of his sight;
and on the south of the temple of Palain, were added
the sacred grove and chapel of Proteons. The western
vestibule was the work of Rhampsinetus, who also
erected two statues, twenty-five cubits in height;
and that on the east was Asychis. It was the largest
and most magnificent of all these propyla, and excelled
as well in the beauty of its sculpture as its
dimensions. Several grand additions were afterwards
made by Psamaticus, who, besides the southern vestibule,
erected a large hyp&aelig;thral court, where Apis
was kept, when exhibited in public. It was surrounded
by a peristyle of figures, twelve cubits
in height, which served instead of columns, and
which were no doubt similar to those in the Memnonium
at Thebes."</p>

<p>Diodorus and Strabo speak highly of its power
and opulence:&mdash;"Never was there a city," observes
the former of these, "which received so many offerings
in silver, gold, obelisks, and colossal statues."</p>

<p>The first shock this city received was from the
Persians<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>. Cambyses, having invaded Egypt, sent a
herald to Memphis, to summon the inhabitants to
surrender. The people, however, transported with
rage, fell upon the herald, and tore him to pieces,
and all that were with him. Cambyses, having soon
after taken the place, fully revenged the indignity,
causing ten times as many Egyptians of the prime<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
nobility, as there had been of his people massacred,
to be publicly executed. Among these was the eldest
son of Psammenitus. As for the king himself, Cambyses
was inclined to treat him kindly. He not only
spared his life, but appointed him an honourable
maintenance. But the Egyptian monarch, little
affected by this kind usage, did what he could to
raise new troubles and commotions, in order to recover
his kingdom; as a punishment for which he was
made to drink bull's blood, and died immediately.
His reign lasted but six months; after which all
Egypt submitted to the conqueror.</p>

<p>When the tyrant came back from Thebes, he dismissed
all the Greeks, and sent them to their respective
homes; but on his return into the city, finding
it full of rejoicing, he fell into a great rage, supposing
all this to have been for the ill success of his expedition.
He therefore called the magistrates before
him, to know the meaning of these rejoicings; and
upon their telling him that it was because they had
found their god, Apis, he would not believe them;
but caused them to be put to death, as impostors,
that insulted him in his misfortunes. And when
he sent for the priests, who made him the same
answer, he replied, that since their god was so
kind and familiar as to appear among them, he would
be acquainted with him, and therefore commanded
him forthwith to be brought to him. But when,
instead of a god be saw a calf, he was strangely
astonished, and falling again into a rage, he drew out
his dagger, and run it into the thigh of the beast;
and then upbraiding the priests for their stupidity in
worshipping a brute for a god, ordered them to be
severely whipped, and all the Egyptians in Memphis,
that should be found celebrating the feast of Apis, to
be slain. The god was carried back to the temple,
where he languished for some time and then died. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
Egyptians say, that after this fact, which they reckon
the highest instance of impiety that ever was committed
among them, Cambyses grew mad. But his
actions show that he had been mad long before.</p>

<p>The splendour of Upper Egypt terminated with
the invasion of Cambyses. He carried with him not
only conquest, but destruction. His warfare was
not merely with the people, but with their palaces
and temples.</p>

<p>At a subsequent period, Memphis was taken by
Alexander. The account we give of that event is
from the same author<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>. As soon as Alexander had
ended the siege of Gaza, he left a garrison there, and
turned the whole power of his army towards Egypt.
In seven days' march he arrived before Pelusium,
whither a great number of Egyptians had assembled,
with all imaginable diligence, to recognize him for
their sovereign. The hatred these people bore to
the Persians was so great, that they valued very
little who should be their king, provided they could
but meet with a hero, to rescue them from the insolence
and indignity with which themselves, and
those who professed their religion, were treated.
Ochus had caused their god Apis to be murdered, in
a manner highly injurious to themselves and their
religion; and the Persians, to whom he had left the
government, continued to make the same mock of
that deity. Thus several circumstances had rendered
the Persians so odious, that upon Amyntas's coming
a little before with a handful of men, he found them
prepared to join, and assist him in expelling the
Persians.</p>

<p>This Amyntas had deserted from Alexander, and
entered into the service of Darius. He had commanded
the Grecian forces at the battle of Issus;
and having fled into Syria, by the country lying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
toward Tripoli, with four thousand men, he had
there seized upon as many vessels as he wanted,
burned the rest, and immediately set sail towards
the island of Cyprus, and afterwards towards Pelusium,
which he took by surprise. As soon as he
found himself possessed of this important city, he
threw off the mask, and made public pretensions to
the crown of Egypt; declaring that the motive of
his coming was to expel the Persians. Upon this, a
multitude of Egyptians, who wished for nothing
so earnestly as to free themselves from these insupportable
tyrants, went over to him. He then
marched directly to Memphis, when, coming to a
battle, he defeated the Persians, and shut them up
in the city. But, after he had gained the victory,
having neglected to keep his soldiers together, they
straggled up and down in search of plunder, which
the enemy seeing, they sallied out upon such as remained,
and cut them to pieces, with Amyntas their
leader. This event, so far from lessening the aversion
the Egyptians had for the Persians, increased it
still more; so that the moment Alexander appeared
upon the frontiers, the people, who were all disposed
to receive that monarch, ran in crowds to submit to
him. His arrival, at the head of a powerful army,
presented them with a secure protection, which
Amyntas could not afford them; and, from this
consideration, they all declared openly in his favour.
Maz&aelig;us, who commanded in Memphis, finding it
would be to no purpose for him to resist so triumphant
an army, since Darius, his sovereign, was
not in a condition to succour him, set open the
gates of the city to the conqueror, and gave up eight
hundred talents, (about &pound;140,000,) and all the king's
furniture. Thus Alexander possessed himself of all
Egypt, without the least opposition.</p>

<p>On the founding of Alexandria by the Macedonian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
conqueror, Memphis lost the honour of being the
metropolis of Egypt; and its history became so obscure,
that little knowledge of it is preserved in
history. We must, therefore, now content ourselves
with stating to what a condition it is now reduced.</p>

<p>Of this celebrated city, which, according to Diodorus
Siculus, was not less than seven leagues in
circumference, and contained a multitude of beautiful
temples, not one stone remains to tell the history;
even the site on which it stood being disputed.
"Is it not astonishing," says Savary, "that the site
of the ancient metropolis of Egypt, a city containing
magnificent temples and palaces, which art laboured
to render eternal, should at present be a subject of
dispute among the learned? Pliny removes the difficulty
of past doubts&mdash;the three grand pyramids, seen
by the watermen from all parts, stand on a barren
and rocky hill, between Memphis and Delta, one
league from the Nile, two from Memphis, and near
the village of Busiris." Rennell, however, says, that
Memf is on the site of Memphis; since Abulfeda
describes it as being a <i>short</i> day's journey from
Cairo: Memf being only fourteen road miles from
that city. M. Maillet says, "The most probable
opinion is, that this superb city was built at the
entrance of the town of mummies, at the north of
which the pyramids are placed: the prodigious ruins
which present themselves in this spot will serve for
a long time as proofs of the greatness of that city,
of which they are remains, and the incontestible
evidences of its true position." Again, he says,
that "out of so many superb monuments, &amp;c., there
remain only at present some shapeless ruins of broken
columns of ruined obelisks, and some other buildings
fallen to decay, which one still discovers at the bottom
of the lake, when the increase of the Nile is too small
to furnish it with its usual supply of water. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
circumstance has twice happened during my seventeen
years' consulship, particularly in the year 1677, when
the surface of the lake sank between eight and nine feet,
and discovered at the bottom of this vast reservoir a
kind of city, which excited the admiration of every
one. This lake can never be dried up, or drawn off
again as before; because they have neglected to keep
up the canal which served to drain off the water.
There are, also, some heaps of ruins in the plain of
three leagues in width, that separates the northern
from the southern pyramids, and in which this ancient
city extended from the borders of the lake towards
the Nile eastward. These are the faint traces of so
much magnificence."</p>

<p>Dr. Shaw is of opinion that Djizeh, or Giseh,
now occupies the site of Memphis; and that the
city is entirely buried in soil. Other authorities,
however, place it, and perhaps with greater probability,
near the village of Menshee or Dashoo.
Norden says: "If we give credit to some authors,
the city of Memphis was situated in the place
where at present stands the village of Gize, and I
own that this opinion does not want probability.
But if we attend to it carefully, we shall find it
necessary to strike off a great deal of grandeur of
that ancient capital of Egypt, or else raise extremely
all the plains about it. In effect, Gize does not occupy
half the space of Old Cairo, and the plains that extend
all round never fail to be deluged at the time of the
overflowing of the waters of the Nile. It is incredible,
that they should have built a city, so great and
famous, in a place subject to be under water half of
the year; still less can it be imagined that the ancient
authors have forgotten so particular a place."</p>

<p>Mr. Browne says: "I visited the pleasant site of the
ancient Memphis on the left bank of the Nile, about
two hours to the south of Kahira, in a plain about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
three miles broad, between the river and the mountains.
The land is now laid down in corn, with date-trees
toward the mountains. Nothing remains except
heaps of rubbish, in which are found pieces of
sculptured stone. The spot has been surrounded by
a canal. Its extent might be marked by that of the
ground where remains are dug up, and which is
always overgrown with a kind of thistle, that seems to
thrive among the ruins. None of the fine marbles,
which are scattered so profusely at Alexandria, are
discoverable here; whether it be that they were never
used, or were carried away to adorn other cities."<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>But though the site of the city is not absolutely
known, certain it is, that many wonderful
erections in its neighbourhood denote its former
grandeur, power, and magnificence. These are the
Catacombs, the Sphinx, the lake of M&#339;ris, and the
Pyramids.</p>

<p>"The entrances into the Catacombs," says the
Earl of Sandwich, "where the inhabitants of the
neighbouring city of Memphis entombed their embalmed
bodies, are near the last Pyramid of Sakara.
The greatest part of the plain of Sakara is hollowed
into subterraneous cavities, all cut out of the solid
rock; not of a hard nature, but yielding to the
least violence. The entrances are many in number;
and are in form a square of three feet, and about
twenty feet deep. The vaults contain embalmed
bodies, scattered in confusion, and many of them
broken in pieces. These have been taken out of their
chests or coffins; and after having been ransacked
in search of any idol of value, which are frequently
found within the bodies, thrown aside by persons,
who would not be at the trouble of carrying them
away. The farther the recesses are penetrated, how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>ever,
the bodies are much more entire, and everything
less disturbed. These subterraneous passages
are divided into many different chambers; in the
sides of which are to be seen a multitude of perpendicular
niches, of sufficient height to contain the
bodies upright."</p>

<p>A little to the east of the second pyramid, is
the <span class="smcap">Sphinx</span>, cut out of the same rock upon which the
pyramids are built. The length is about twenty-five
feet; and its height, from the knees to the top
of the hand, thirty-eight feet.</p>

<p>"The sphinx," says Mr. Wilkinson, "stands
nearly opposite the south end of the pyramid
Cephren: between its paws were discovered an altar
and some tablets; but no entrance was visible.
Pliny says, they suppose it the tomb of Amasis;&mdash;a
tradition which arose, no doubt, from the resemblance
of the name of the king, by whose order the
rock was cut into this form. But one author has gone
farther, and given to Amasis the pyramids themselves.
The cap of the sphinx, probably the pshent,
has long since been removed; but a cavity in the
head, attests its former position, and explains the
mode in which it was fixed. The mutilated state
of the face, and the absence of the nose, have led
many to the erroneous conclusion, that the features
were African; but by taking an accurate sketch of
the face, and restoring the Egyptian nose, any one
may convince himself, that the lips, as well as the
rest of the features, perfectly agree with the physiognomy
of a Pharaoh; for the reader must be
aware, that this, and all other sphinxes, are emblematic
representations of Egyptian kings."</p>

<p>Between the paws of the sphinx, a perfect temple
was discovered, a few years ago, by the intrepid
traveller Belzoni, on clearing away the sand by which
it had been choked up for ages.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span></p>

<p>This figure was<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>, a few years ago, at an expense of
800 or 900<i>l.</i> (contributed by some European gentlemen,)
cleared from the sand which had accumulated
in front of it, under the superintendence of Captain
Caviglia.</p>

<p>The noblest and most wonderful of all the structures<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
or works of the kings of Egypt, was the lake
of M&#339;ris; accordingly, Herodotus considers it as
vastly superior to the pyramids and labyrinth. As
Egypt was more or less fruitful in proportion to the
inundations of the Nile; and as, in these floods, the
first general flow or ebb of the waters were equally
fertile to the land; King M&#339;ris, to prevent these
two inconveniences, and correct, as far as lay in his
power, the irregularities of the Nile, thought proper
to call art to the assistance of nature; and so caused
the lake to be dug, which afterwards went by his
name. This lake was several thousand paces long,
and very deep. Two pyramids, on each of which
stood a colossal statue, seated on a throne, raised
their heads to the height of three hundred feet,
in the midst of the lake, whilst their foundations
took up the same space under the waters; a proof
that they were erected before the cavity was filled;
and a demonstration that a lake of such vast extent,
was the work of man's hands, in one prince's
reign. This is what several historians have related
concerning the Lake M&#339;ris, on the testimony of the
inhabitants of the country. This lake had a communication
with the Nile, by a great canal, four
leagues long, and fifty feet broad. Great sluices
either opened or shut the canal and lake, as there
was occasion.</p>

<p>When it is considered, that the object of this
work was the advantage and comfort of a numerous
people, all must agree, with M. Savary, that M&#339;ris,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
who constructed it, performed a far more glorious
work than either the labyrinth or the pyramids.</p>

<p>At present, this lake is of a much smaller extent:
but this by no means proves that Herodotus and
other writers were deceived in their calculations; for,
considering the revolutions to which Egypt has been
subject for a series of two thousand years, it might
have undergone still greater changes.</p>

<p>For the period of nearly one thousand two hundred
years, since which Egypt has fallen into the
hands of barbarous nations, they have either destroyed,
or suffered to perish, the chief part of this
lake, and the canal belonging to it. The M&#339;reotis
is dried up, the canal of Alexandria is no longer
navigable, and the M&#339;ris is only fifty leagues in
circumference. "If," says an enlightened writer,
"the Canal of Joseph was cleared out, where the
mud is raised up to a vast height; if the ancient
dykes were re-established; and the sluices of the
canals of Tamich and Bouch restored; Lake M&#339;ris
would still serve the same purposes. It would prevent
the devastation of the too great swellings of the
rivers, and supply the deficiency of those that are
inadequate. We should see it, as on former occasions,
extending itself from Nesle and Arsinoe, to
the Lybian mountains, and offering to astonished
travellers what is no where else to be seen;&mdash;a sea
formed by the hand of man."</p>

<p>The annihilation of Memphian palaces and temples
indeed is almost compensated by the existence of the
pyramids, which alone are sufficient to engage the
attention of mankind. The three largest are situated
at Gees, or Ghesa, and named from their founders,
<span class="smcap">Cheops</span>, <span class="smcap">Chephren</span>, and <span class="smcap">Mycerines</span>; of these only
we shall speak.</p>

<p>1. That of <span class="smcap">Cheops</span>, the largest, is four hundred
and forty-eight feet in height, and seven hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
and twenty-eight on each side of the base: that is,
forty feet higher than St. Peter's, at Rome; and
one hundred and thirty-three feet higher than St.
Paul's, in London.</p>

<p>This pyramid, like the rest, was built on a rock,
having a square base, cut on the outside as so many
steps, and decreasing gradually quite to the summit.
It was built with stones of a prodigious size, the
least of which were thirty feet, wrought with
wonderful art, and covered with hieroglyphics.
According to several ancient authors, each side
was eight hundred feet broad, and as many high.
The summit of the pyramids, which, to those who
viewed it from below, seemed a point, was a fine
platform, composed of ten or twelve massy stones,
and each side of that platform sixteen or eighteen
feet long.</p>

<p>It is also remarkable that the four sides of this,
and indeed of all the pyramids, face the cardinal
points. The inside contained numberless rooms and
apartments. There were expressed on the pyramid,
in Egyptian characters, the sums it cost only in
garlic, leeks, onions, and the like, for the workmen;
and the whole amounted to sixteen hundred talents
of silver; from whence it was easy to conjecture what
a vast sum the whole must have amounted to.</p>

<p>Herodotus ascribes this pyramid to Cheops, a tyrannical
and profligate sovereign. He barred the avenues
to every temple, and forbade the Egyptians to offer
sacrifice to their gods; after which he compelled the
people at large to perform the work of slaves. Some
he condemned to hew stones out of the Arabian
mountains, and drag them to the banks of the Nile;
others were stationed to receive the same in vessels,
and transport them to the edge of the Libyan Desert.
In this service a hundred thousand men were employed,
who were relieved every three months. Ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
years were spent in the hard labour of forming the
road on which these stones were to be drawn,&mdash;a
work of no less difficulty and fatigue than the erection
of the pyramid itself. This causeway is five
stadia in length, forty cubits wide, and its greatest
height thirty-two cubits; the whole being composed
of polished marble, adorned with the figures of animals.
Ten years were consumed in forming this
pavement, in preparing the hill on which the pyramids
are raised, and in excavating chambers under
the ground. The burial-place which he intended for
himself, he contrived to insulate within the building,
by introducing the waters of the Nile. The pyramid
itself was a work of twenty years; it is of a square
form, every side being eight plethra in length and as
many in height. The stones are very skilfully
cemented, and none of them of less dimensions than
thirty feet. Such is the account of Herodotus.</p>

<p>Pliny and Diodorus Siculus agree in stating that
not less than three hundred and sixty thousand men
were employed in the work<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span></p>

<p>The pyramid next in size was erected by Cephrenus,
and is thence called <span class="smcap">Cephren</span>: he was the son
of Cheops. These two princes, who were truly
brothers by the similitude of their manners, seem
to have striven which of them should distinguish
himself most, by a barefaced impiety towards the
gods, and a barbarous inhumanity to men. Cheops
reigned fifty years, and his son Cephrenus fifty-six
years after him. They kept the temples shut
during the whole time of their long reigns, and
forbade the offering of sacrifices under the severest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
penalties. On the other hand, they oppressed their
subjects, by employing them in the most grievous
and useless works; and sacrificed the lives of numberless
multitudes of men, merely to gratify a senseless
ambition of immortalising their names by edifices of
an enormous magnitude and a boundless expense. It
is remarkable, that those stately pyramids which have
so long been the admiration of the whole world, were
the effect of the irreligion and merciless cruelty of
those princes.</p>

<p>The magnificent prospect from the top of this pyramid
has been described by the French traveller, Savary,
who visited Egypt in 1770, in glowing terms. After
occupying seven hours in ascending to its summit,
"the morning light," says he, "discovered to us every
moment new beauties: the tops of gilded minarets,
and of date-tree and citron groves, planted round the
villages and hills; anon the herds left the hamlets;
the boats spread their light sails, and our eyes followed
them along the vast windings of the Nile. On the
north appeared sterile hills and barren sands; on the
south, the river and waving fields, vast as the ocean;
to the west, the plain of Fayum, famous for its roses:
to the east, the picturesque town of Gizeh, and the
towers of Fostat, the minarets of Cairo, and the castle
of Saladin, terminated the prospect. Seated on the
most wonderful of the works of man, as upon a
throne, our eyes beheld by turns a dreadful desert;
rich plains in which the Elysian fields had been imagined;
villages; a majestic river; and edifices which
seemed the work of giants. The universe contains no
landscape more variegated, more magnificent, or more
awful."</p>

<p>The ancients knew little of the interior structure
of these giant piles.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> Herodotus, who lived 445
years before Christ, merely speaks of an entrance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
leading to the interior, by hearsay from the priests,
who informed him that there were secret vaults beneath,
hewn out of the natural rock. Strabo, who
lived after the Christian era, only describes a single
slanting passage which led to a chamber in which
was a stone tomb. Diodorus Siculus, who lived
forty-four years before Christ, agrees with this; and
Pliny, who lived <small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 66, adds, that there was a
well in the Great Pyramid, eighty cubits deep.
This is all the ancients have said about the interior.</p>

<p>"The Egyptian priests, indeed, assured Aristides,
a Greek traveller about two centuries before Christ,
that 'the excavations beneath were as great as the
height above.' And Ebn Abd Alkokim, an Arabic
writer of the ninth century, says, that the builders
'constructed numerous excavated chambers, with
gates to them, forty cubits under ground.' Other
Arabian writers say, that these chambers contain
chests of black stone, in which were deposited the
sacred archives of king Saurid, who built the pyramid.
Many discoveries (perhaps a burial-place
under ground) obviously remain to be made.</p>

<p>"The same Arab historian, Alkokim, gives an account
of the opening of this building under the
Caliphate, from which time it has remained in the
condition seen and described by all modern travellers,
to the time of the Italian traveller Caviglia, who
made a discovery of a new chamber and passages
about ten years ago. 'After that, Almamon the
Caliph (<small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 820) entered Egypt, and saw the Pyramids:
he desired to know what was within, and
therefore would have them opened. He was told it
could not possibly be done. He replied, I will have
it certainly done. And that hole was opened for
him, which stands open to this day, with fire and
vinegar. Two smiths prepared and sharpened the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
iron and engines, which they forced in: and there
was a great expense in the opening it; and the thickness
of the wall was found to be twenty cubits.
Within they found a square well, and in the square
of it there were doors: every door of it opened into
a house (or vault), in which there were dead bodies
wrapped up in linen. Towards the upper part of
the pyramid, they found a chamber, in which was a
hollow stone; in it was a statue of stone, like a man,
and within it a man, upon whom was a breast-plate
of gold, set with jewels, and on him were written
characters with a pen, which no man can explain.'</p>

<p>"Greaves, an Englishman, who visited the Great
Pyramid in 1648, described the passages thus opened,
and then open, very accurately, and suspected
that at the bottom of a well in the pyramid was
the passage to those secret vaults mentioned by
Herodotus; but he made no new discovery. Davison,
who visited it in the middle of the eighteenth
century, discovered some secret chambers and passages
connecting the largest gallery with the central
room, and an apartment four feet high over it. He
descended the well 155 feet, but found farther progress
blocked up. Caviglia was the first to discover
the above suspected passage. After much trouble
in clearing the narrow opening at the end of the first
or entrance gallery of the pyramid, he found that it
did not terminate at that point, as hitherto supposed,
but proceeded downwards to the distance of two
hundred feet. It ended in a doorway on the right,
which was found to communicate with the bottom of
the well. But the new passage did not terminate
here: it went beyond the doorway twenty-three
feet, and then took a horizontal direction for twenty-eight
more, where it opened into a spacious chamber
immediately under the central room.</p>

<p>"This new chamber is twenty-seven feet broad, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
sixty-six feet long. The floor is irregular; nearly
one half of the length from the eastern, or entrance
end, being level, and about fifteen feet from the
ceiling; while, in the middle, it descends five feet
lower, in which part there is a hollow space bearing
all the appearance of the commencement of a well,
or shaft. From thence it rises to the western
end, so that there is scarcely room between the
floor and the ceiling to stand upright.</p>

<p>"On the south of this chamber is a passage hollowed
out, just high and wide enough for a man to
creep along upon his hands and knees, which continues
in the rock for fifty-five feet, and then suddenly
ends. Another at the east end commences
with a kind of arch, and runs about forty feet into
the solid body of the pyramid.</p>

<p>Mr. Salt, the late intelligent British Consul to
Egypt, was so struck by this discovery, as to express
his belief that the under-ground rooms were
used for 'the performance of solemn and secret
mysteries.'</p>

<p>"As to the second pyramid of Gizeh, the ancients
knew less about it than they did of the first. Herodotus
says it has no under-ground chambers, and
the other ancient authorities are silent. But the
enterprising Belzoni found its entrance, in the north
front, in 1818, and discovered, at the same time, that
it had been previously forced open by the Arabian
Caliph, Ali Mehemet, <small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 782, more than a thousand
years before. After forcing an entrance, and
advancing along a narrow passage, one hundred
feet long, he found a central chamber, forty-six feet
long by sixteen wide, and twenty-three high, cut out
of the solid rock. It contained a granite sarcophagus,
(a tomb,) half sunk in the floor, with some bones in
it, which, on inspection by Sir Everard Home, proved
to be those of a cow. An Arabic inscription on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
walls implies that it had been opened in the presence
of the Sultan Ali Mehemet<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>."</p>

<p>This pyramid was, as has been already said, opened
by Belzoni. We shall select another account of
this enterprise.</p>

<p>"According to Herodotus, (whose information
has generally been found correct,) this pyramid was
constructed without any internal chambers. M. Belzoni,
however, believed the fact might be otherwise;
and having reasons of his own for commencing
his operations at a certain point, he began his labours,
and with so much foresight as actually to dig directly
down upon a forced entrance. But, even after
this success, none but a Belzoni would have had the
perseverance to pursue the labour required to perfect
the discovery. It was by attending to the same
kind of indications, which had led him so successfully
to explore the six tombs of the kings in Thebes, that
he was induced to commence his operations on the
north side.</p>

<p>"He set out from Cairo on the 6th of February,
1818, went to the Kaia Bey, and gained permission; the
Bey having first satisfied himself that there was no
tilled ground within a considerable distance of Ghiza.
On the 10th of February he began with six labourers
in a vertical section at right angles to the north
side of the base, cutting through a mass of stones
and lime which had fallen from the upper part of the
pyramid, but were so completely aggregated together
as to spoil the mattocks, &amp;c. employed in the
operation. He persevered in making an opening
fifteen feet wide, working downwards, and uncovering
the face of the pyramid. During the first week
there was but little prospect of meeting with anything
interesting; but on the 17th, one of the Arabs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
employed called out with great vociferation that he
had found the entrance. He had, in fact, come upon
a hole into which he could thrust his arm and a
djerid six feet long. Before night they ascertained
that an aperture was there, about three feet square,
which had been closed irregularly with a hewn stone.
This being removed, they reached a larger opening,
but filled with rubbish and sand. M. Belzoni was
now satisfied that this was not a real, but a forced
passage. Next day they had penetrated fifteen feet,
when stones and sand began to fall from above; these
were removed, but still they continued to fall in large
quantities, when, after some more days' labour, he
discovered an upper forced entrance, communicating
with the outside from above. Having cleared this,
he found another opening running inward, which
proved, on further search, to be a continuation of the
lower horizontal forced passage, nearly all choked up
with rubbish. This being removed, he discovered,
about half way from the outside, a descending forced
passage, which terminated at the distance of forty
feet. He now continued to work in the horizontal
passage, in hope that it might lead to the centre, but
it terminated at the depth of ninety feet; and he
found it prudent not to force it further, as the stones
were very loose over-head, and one actually fell, and
had nearly killed one of the people. He therefore
now began clearing away the aggregated stones and
lime to the eastward of the forced entrance; but by
this time his retreat had been discovered, and he
found himself much interrupted by visitors.</p>

<p>"On the 28th of February he discovered, at the
surface of the pyramid, a block of granite, having the
same direction as that of the passage of the first
pyramid, that of Cheops; and he now hoped that
he was not far from the true entrance. Next day
he removed some large blocks, and on the 2d of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
March he entered the true passage, an opening four
feet high, and three feet and a half wide, formed by
blocks of granite, and continued descending at an
angle of about twenty-six degrees to the length of one
hundred and four feet five inches, lined all the length
with granite. From this passage he had to remove
the stones with which it was filled, and at its bottom
was a door or portcullis of granite, (fitted into a
niche also made of granite,) supported at the height
of eight inches by small stones placed under it.
Two days were occupied in raising it high enough
to admit of entrance. This door is one foot three
inches thick, and, with the granite niche, occupies
seven feet of the passage, where the granite work
ends, and a short passage, gradually ascending twenty-two
feet seven inches towards the centre, the descending
commences; at the end of which is a perpendicular
of fifteen feet. On the left is a small forced passage
cut in the rock; and above, on the right, a forced
passage running upward, and turning to the north
thirty feet, just over the portcullis. At the bottom
of the perpendicular, after removing some rubbish,
he found the entrance of another passage, which inclined
northward. But, quitting this for the present,
he followed his prime passage, which now took a
horizontal direction; and at the end of it, one hundred
and fifty-eight feet eight inches from the above-mentioned
perpendicular, he entered a chamber forty-six
feet three inches long, sixteen feet three inches
wide, and twenty-three feet six inches in height, for
the greater part cut out of the rock; and in the
middle of this room he found a <span class="smcap">sarcophagus</span> of granite,
eight feet long, three feet six inches wide, and
two feet three inches deep inside, surrounded by large
blocks of granite, as if to prevent its being removed.
The lid had been opened, and he found in the interior
a few bones, which he supposed to be human; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
some of them having been since carried to England
by Captain Fitzclarence, who was afterwards in this
pyramid, and one of them (a thigh-bone) having,
on examination by Sir Everard Home, been found
to have belonged to a cow, it has been doubted whether
any of them ever belonged to a human subject:
but such a suspicion is premature, and without any
solid foundation; since it appears, from an Arabic
inscription on the west wall of this chamber, that
this pyramid was opened by architects named Mahomet
El Aghar and Othman, and inspected in the
presence of the Sultan Ali Mahomet, the first Ugloch
(a Tartaric title, as Uleg Bey, &amp;c.). The length of
time the pyramid remained open is not known; and
it indeed appears to have been closed only by the fall
of portions of the structure, and by the collecting of
the sands of Libya. From this, and from the lid of
the sarcophagus having been opened, and the remains
of other animals being also found in the same sarcophagus,
as is stated in other accounts, such an opinion
does not even appear to be probable. On other parts
of the walls are some inscriptions, supposed by M.
Belzoni to be in Coptic.</p>

<p>"He now returned to the descending passage at the
bottom of the above-mentioned perpendicular. Its
angle is about twenty-six degrees. At the end of forty-eight
feet and a half it becomes horizontal, still going
north fifty-five feet; in the middle of which horizontal
part there is a recess to the east eleven feet
deep, and a passage to the west twenty feet, which
descends into a chamber thirty-two feet long, nine
feet nine inches wide, and eight and a half high. In
this room were only a few small square blocks of
stone, and on the walls some unknown inscriptions.
He now returned to the horizontal part and advanced
north, ascending at an angle of sixty degrees; and in
this, at a short distance from the horizontal part, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
met with another niche, which had been formerly
furnished with a granite door, the fragments of which
were still there. At forty-seven feet and a half from
this niche the passage was filled with large stones, so
as to close the entrance, which issues out precisely at
the base of the pyramid. All the works below the
base are cut in the rock, as well as part of the passages
and chambers.</p>

<p>"By clearing away the earth to the eastward of the
pyramid, he found the foundation and part of the
walls of an extensive temple which stood before it at
the distance of forty feet, and laid bare a pavement
composed of fine blocks of calcareous stone, some of
them beautifully cut and in fine preservation. This
platform probably goes round the whole pyramid.
The stones composing the foundation of the temple
are very large: one, which he measured, was twenty-one
feet long, ten high, and eight in breadth<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>."</p>

<p>The pyramid of <span class="smcap">Mycerinus</span> is one hundred and
sixty-two feet in height, and two hundred and eighty
on each side of the base. "If," says Diodorus Siculus,
"it is less in size and extent than the others, it is superior
to them in the costliness of the materials and
excellence of the workmanship."</p>

<p>Of Mycerinus historians write in the following
manner:&mdash;He was the son of Cheops, but of a character
opposite to that of his father. So far from
walking in his steps, he detested his conduct, and
pursued quite different measures. He again opened
the temples of the gods, restored the sacrifices, did all
that lay in his power to comfort his subjects, and
make them forget their past miseries; and believed
himself set over them for no other purpose but to
exercise justice, and to make them taste all the blessings
of an equitable and peaceful administration. He
heard their complaints, dried their tears, eased their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
misery, and thought himself not so much the master as
the father of his people. This procured him the love
of them all. Egypt resounded with his praises, and
his name commanded veneration in all places.</p>

<p>"Men," says one writer, "have very justly reckoned
these prodigious masses of earth and stone among the
wonders of the world; nevertheless their use appears
to us very trivial, or is unknown. The Egyptians
seem to have been more desirous of exciting wonder,
than of communicating instruction."&mdash;"The most
probable opinion respecting the object of these vast
edifices," says another writer, "is that which combines
the double use of the sepulchre and the temple,
nothing being more common in all nations than
to bury distinguished men in places consecrated by
the rites of divine worship. If Cheops, Suphis, or
whoever else was the founder of the Great Pyramid,
intended it only for his tomb, what occasion, says
Dr. Shaw, for such a narrow sloping entrance into it,
or for the well, as it is called, at the bottom;&mdash;or for
the lower chamber with a large niche or hole in the
eastern wall of it;&mdash;or for the long narrow cavities in
the sides of the large upper room, which likewise is
incrusted all over with the finest marble;&mdash;or for the
two ante-chambers and the lofty gallery, with benches
on each side, that introduce us into it? As the whole
of the Egyptian theology was clothed in mysterious
emblems and figures, it seems reasonable to suppose
that all these turnings, apartments, and secrets in
architecture, were intended for some nobler purpose;&mdash;for
the catacombs or burying-places are plain
vaulted chambers hewn out of the natural rock;&mdash;and
the deity rather, which was typified in the
outward form of this pile, was to be worshipped
within."</p>

<p>"If thoughtlessness should condemn the im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>mense
and apparently useless labours of ancient
Egypt," says a third, "so are they easily condemned,
under the use of the ever-acceptable term tyranny,
the ever-ready word of him who abuses all the power
which he can command. Yet he who would eat
must labour: it is the unvarying law, not of God
alone, but of human society; the bond by which it
is held together. The soil of Egypt was the possession
of its singular government, and the labour of the
people was the only manner in which they could
demand or acquire a share of the produce: it was
the only mode in which they ought to have possessed
their portions. There is reason to believe that the
soil had appropriated all the labour applicable to it;
and commercial industry, as it then was, had probably
done the same. An artificial invention to
occupy labour became, therefore, imperiously necessary;
and through this was Egypt peopled to an
extent which seems to have been very great. The
bearing of this fact on other cases, where, under a
general law pervading all creation, conditions of
labour have been attached to possession, must be
obvious; and though tyranny had been the immediate
cause, even thus does the Deity often direct the
wickedness of man to his own good ends."</p>

<p>"I should, however," says a fourth, (Maupertuis,)
"have been much better pleased had the kings of Egypt
employed the millions of men who reared these pyramids
in the air, in digging cavities in the earth of a
depth answerable to the marvellous we find in the
works of those princes."&mdash;"There have been many
opinions expressed by learned men as to the object
of these structures," says a fifth. One is, that
they were the granaries of Joseph. This may be
confuted by the smallness of the rooms, and the
time required in building. Another, that they were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
observatories; which is accusing the builders of great
absurdity, since the neighbouring rocks were better
calculated for the purpose. The Arabians generally
think that they were built by king Saurid, before
the Deluge, as a refuge for himself and the public
records from the Flood; but this opinion requires no
answer. Josephus, the Jewish historian, who wrote
<small>A.&nbsp;D.</small> 71, ascribes them to his countrymen, during
the captivity in Egypt. As sun-dials, they would
have failed. Shaw and Bryant, who wrote in the
middle of the last century, believed them to be
temples, and the stone chest, a tank for holding
water used for purification. Pauw, who lived at
the same time with Shaw and Bryant, considers the
Great Pyramid as the tomb of Osiris; and that Osiris
having fourteen tombs for various parts of his dismembered
body, fourteen pyramids must have been
devoted to them, and the annual funeral mysteries
connected with his death and resurrection. But the
greater number of writers, ancient and modern, believe
it to be the tomb of Cheops, the alleged builder.
Improving on this notion, Maillet (1760) supposed
that the chambers were built for the purpose of shutting
up the friends of the deceased king with the
dead body; and that the holes on each side of the
central chamber of the Great Pyramid were the means
by which they were to be supplied with food, &amp;c:
an opinion which would have appeared sufficiently
ludicrous, if it had not been exceeded by that expressed
by an old Moulah to Buonaparte, when in
Egypt (1799), that the object was to keep the buried
body undecayed, by closely sealing up all access
to the outward air. Another ingenious theory
ascribes them to the shepherd kings, a foreign pastoral
nation which oppressed Egypt in the early times
of the Pharaohs. However, this is, after all, but con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>jecture.
The utmost uncertainty exists in all that
concerns these gigantic, unwieldy, and mysterious
buildings. Their builders, origin, date, and purposes,
are entirely lost in the night of ages. As
the sides of all the pyramids face the cardinal points,
and of course give the true meridian of the places
where they are situated, it would seem that their
builders had made some progress in <i>scientific</i> knowledge;
and the buildings themselves, under all circumstances,
notwithstanding their plain exterior,
clearly show the advanced state of art in those very
early times.</p>

<p>When the traveller approaches<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> those vast monuments
of human labour, the imagination seems to
burst, as it were, the bands of ages, and the mind
appears as if it had lived a thousand years. When
the French were at Thebes, the whole army stopped
among the ruins, and clapped their hands with delight:
and when Buonaparte was about to engage the Mamelukes,
who were advancing with loud cries, superbly
accoutred, he called out to his army, "Behold!
Yonder are the Pyramids; the most ancient of the
works of men. From the summits of those monuments
forty ages are now beholding us." The battle
which ensued laid all Egypt at the feet of the
French general.</p>

<p>We shall finish this account by selecting a passage
from Rollin:&mdash;"Such were the famous Egyptian
Pyramids, which, by their figure as well as size,
have triumphed over the injuries of time and the
barbarians. But what efforts soever men may make,
their nothingness will always appear. These pyramids
were tombs; and there is still to be seen in the
middle of the largest, an empty sepulchre, cut out of
one entire stone, about three feet deep and broad, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
a little above six feet long<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>. Thus all this bustle,
all this expense, and all the labours of so many
thousand men, ended in procuring a prince, in this
vast and almost boundless pile of building, a little
vault six feet in length. Besides, the kings who
built these pyramids had it not in their power to be
buried in them, and so did not enjoy the sepulchre
they had built. The public hatred which they incurred,
by reason of their unheard-of cruelties to their
subjects, in laying such heavy tasks upon them,
occasioned their being interred in some obscure place,
to prevent their bodies from being exposed to the
fury and vengeance of the populace.</p>

<p>"This last circumstance, which historians have taken
particular notice of, teaches us what judgment we
ought to pass on these edifices, so much boasted of
by the ancients. It is but just to remark and esteem
the noble genius which the Egyptians had for architecture;
a genius that prompted them from the
earliest times, and before they could have any models
to imitate, to aim in all things at the grand and
magnificent, and to be intent on real beauties, without
deviating in the least from a noble simplicity, in
which the highest perfection of the art consists. But
what idea ought we to form of those princes, who
considered as something grand, the raising, by a multitude
of hands and by the help of money, immense
structures, with the sole view of rendering their

to put his name in the inscription which was fixed on the tower,
instead of his own. It was very short and plain, according to
the manner of the ancients. <i>Sostratus Cnidius Dexiphanis
F. Diis Servatoribus pro navigantibus</i>, <i>i. e.</i>, "Sostratus the
Cnidian, son of Dexiphanes, to the protecting deities, for the use
of sea-faring people." But certainly Ptolemy must have very
much undervalued that kind of immortality which princes are
generally very fond of, to suffer that his name should not be so
much as mentioned in the inscription of an edifice so capable of
immortalising him. What we read in Lucian, concerning this
matter, deprives Ptolemy of a modesty, which indeed would be very
ill-placed here. This author informs us that Sostratus, seeing the
king determined to engross the whole glory of that noble structure
to himself, caused the inscription with his own name to be carved
in the marble, which he afterwards covered with lime, and thereon
put the king's name. The lime soon mouldered away: and by that
means, instead of procuring the king the honour with which he had
flattered himself, served only to discover to future ages his unjust
and ridiculous vanity.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rollin.</span></p></div>

was opened by the military and naval officers for the
purpose of removing the prostrate obelisk to England. With the
money so raised they purchased one of the vessels, sunk by the
French in the old port of Alexandria: this was raised, and prepared
for the reception of the obelisk. The French had already cleared
away the heaps of rubbish which enveloped it, and the English
turned it round, and found it in a fine state of preservation. It was
moved towards the vessel, when an order arrived from the Admiralty,
prohibiting the sailors from being employed at this work.
No further attempts have been made to remove this fine monument
to Europe.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Anon.</span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_65_65" id="Footnote_65_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65_65"><span class="label">[65]</span></a> The theatre of the ancients was divided into three principal
parts; each of which had its peculiar appellation. The division for
the actors was called in general the <i>scene</i>, or <i>stage</i>; that for the
spectators was particularly termed the <i>theatre</i>, which must have
been of vast extent, as at Athens it was capable of containing above
thirty thousand persons; and the <i>orchestra</i>, which, amongst the
Greeks, was the place assigned for the pantomimes and dancers,
though at Rome it was appropriated to the senators and vestal
virgins.
</p><p>
The theatre was of a semicircular form on one side, and square
on the other. The space contained within the semicircle was
allotted to the spectators, and had seats placed one above another
to the top of the building. The square part, in the front of it, was
the actors' division; and in the interval, between both, was the
orchestra.
</p><p>
The great theatres had three rows of porticoes, raised one upon
another, which formed the body of the edifice, and at the same
time three different stories for the seats. From the highest of
those porticoes the women saw the representation, covered from the
weather. The rest of the theatre was uncovered, and all the business
of the stage was performed in the open air.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_67_67" id="Footnote_67_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_67_67"><span class="label">[67]</span></a> Plutarch, in his inquiry whether the Athenians were more
eminent in the arts of war or in the arts of peace, severely censures
their insatiable fondness for diversions. He asserts, that the money,
idly thrown away upon the representation of the tragedies of
Sophocles and Euripides alone, amounted to a much greater sum
than had been expended in all their wars against the Persians, in
defence of their liberty and common safety. That judicious philosopher
and historian, to the eternal infamy of the Athenians, records
a severe but sensible reflection of a Laced&aelig;monian, who happened
to be present at these diversions. The generous Spartan, trained
up in a state where public virtue still continued to be the object of
public applause, could not behold the ridiculous assiduity of the
Choragi, or magistrates who presided at the public shows, and the
immense sums which they lavished in the decorations of a new
tragedy, without indignation. He therefore frankly told the
Athenians, that they were highly criminal in wasting so much
time, and giving that serious attention to trifles, which ought to be
dedicated to the affairs of the public. That it was still more criminal
to throw away upon such baubles as the decorations of a
theatre, that money which ought to be applied to the equipment of
their fleet, or the support of their army. That diversions ought to
be treated merely as diversions, and might serve to relax the mind
at our idle hours, or when over a bottle; if any kind of utility could
arise from such trifling pleasures. But to see the Athenians make
the duty, they owed to their country, give way to their passion for
the entertainments of the theatre, and to waste unprofitably that
Footnote: time and money upon such frivolous diversions, which ought to be
appropriated to the affairs and the necessities of the state, appeared
to him to be the height of infatuation."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Montague.</span></p></div>

most affecting solemnities of which history makes mention. He
was seventy-six years old when he died; and in the instructions
which he left for his interment, he desired to be buried at Marathon,
where he was born; but the Athenians insisted upon possessing
his remains; and they caused the youth of their city to bear
him to the Stadium Panathenaicum, which he had built; all the
people accompanying, and pouring forth lamentations as for a deceased
parent.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Clarke.</span></p></div>

marble temples are white; but, with the exception of the temple of
Minerva at Cape Colonna, (which is built of Parian marble,) this is
not the case. The marble of Pentelicus, with which all the temples
at Athens were built, throws out an oxide of iron of the richest
yellow, and this certainly makes them infinitely more picturesque
than if they were purely white."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_86_86" id="Footnote_86_86"></a><a href="#FNanchor_86_86"><span class="label">[86]</span></a> "The two principal statues among the Elgin marbles are those
of Theseus, the Athenian hero, and a recumbent figure, supposed
to be the river-god Ilissus (numbered in the Synopsis 93 and 99).
They are executed in a style of extraordinary breadth and grandeur.
Theseus is represented half reclined on a rock, covered with the
skin of a lion, and appears to be resting after some mighty labour.
The figure of the Ilissus is less robust: all his contours flow in
lines of undulating elegance. But in both these statues, that
which chiefly strikes us, in spite of the dilapidations which they
have suffered, is the vitality which seems to pervade them. In
these, not only the office and appearance of the muscles, whether
in action or at rest, but the bearings of the skeleton, are expressed
with an accuracy which could only have resulted from the most
profound science, added to an acute and perpetual observation of
nature. The statue of the Ilissus is especially remarkable for its
graceful flexibility; and we would observe, without going too technically
into the subject, how different is the indentation, formed by
the lower line of the ribs in this figure, so admirably expressing its
position, from that geometrical arch by which this part of the body
is designated in the ordinary antique statues, and which is so rarely
accommodated to the action represented. The principle, pointed
out in this instance, may be traced throughout the Elgin marbles, in
which true art is never superseded by conventional style. We
believe that in the opinion of the majority of connoisseurs, the
statue of Theseus is considered superior to that of the Ilissus.
Canova, however, preferred the latter; and Raffaelle, who imported
designs from Greece, has adapted this figure to that of the fallen
Commander, in his picture of Heliodorus. It is well known that
the Ilissus was a small stream which ran along the south side of
the plain of Athens. The statue in which it is here personified
occupied the left angle of the west pediment of the Parthenon, and
that of Theseus was placed opposite to it on the east pediment next
to the horses of Hyperion."</p></div>

"that walls of the height of the London monument
might have, during the long existence of a great empire, been raised
to protect so great a city as Nineveh; but it requires a much greater
stretch of thought to conceive them, as in the case of Babylon, to
be raised to a height equal to that of the cross which terminates the
dome or cupola of St. Paul's cathedral in London. Yet, when
we recollect that Nebuchadnezzar was intoxicated with conquest, in
possession of unbounded power and riches, and ambitious of erecting
a metropolis for all Asia, upon a scale which should surpass every
city the world had seen, we shall hesitate in condemning as improbable
even the descriptions of Herodotus."</p></div>

may form the very eminences, spoken of by M. Niebuhr, and which

Bishop Newton, that it must afford all readers of an exalted taste
and generous sentiments, a very sensible pleasure to hear the prophets
exulting over such tyrants and oppressors as the kings of
Assyria. "In the fourteenth chapter of Isaiah," continues he,
"there is an Epinikion, or a triumphant ode upon the fall of
Babylon. It represents the infernal mansions as moved, and the
ghosts of deceased tyrants as rising to meet the king of Babylon,
and congratulate his coming among them."&mdash;"It is really admirable
for the severest strokes of irony as well as for the sublimest
strains of poetry. The Greek poet Alc&aelig;us, who is celebrated for
his hatred to tyrants, and whose odes were animated with the spirit

said that implies the contrary; and it cannot be believed, if
Darius had taken the trouble to level thirty-four miles of so prodigious
a rampart as that of Babylon, that ever it would have been
rebuilt in the manner described by Ctesias, Clitarchus, and others,
who describe it at a much later period. Besides, it would have

thousand sail, to which were to be added docks and magazines for
stores. The ships of Nearchus, as well as others from Ph&#339;nicia,
were already arrived. They had been taken to pieces on the Mediterranean

Persia, in regard to this wonderful person. Amongst others,
this:&mdash;"The astrologers had foretold, that when Alexander's death
was near, he would place his throne where the earth was of iron
and the sky of gold. When the hero, fatigued with conquest,
directed his march towards Greece, he was one day seized with a
bleeding at the nose. A general who was near, unlacing his coat
of mail, spread it for his prince to sit on; and, to defend him from
the sun, held a golden shield over his head. When Alexander
saw himself in this situation, he exclaimed, 'The prediction of the
astrologers is accomplished, I no longer belong to the living! Alas!
that the work of my youth should be finished! Alas! that the
plant of the spring should be cut down like the ripened tree of
autumn!' He wrote to his mother, saying, he should shortly
quit the earth and pass to the regions of the dead. He requested
that the alms given at his death should be bestowed on such as had
never seen the miseries of the world, and who had never lost those
who were dear to them. In conformity to his will, his mother
sought, but in vain, for such persons. All had tasted the woes and
griefs of life; all had lost those whom they loved. She found in
this a consolation which her son had intended, for her great loss.
She saw that her own was the common lot of humanity."</p></div>

in one of the journals (The Saturday Magazine):&mdash;"The present
population of Hillah, which may average from six to seven thousand
souls, consists chiefly of Arabs, who have their own Sheik, but
the Mutsellim, or governor of the place, is under the pacha of Bagdad,
and resides in a fortress within the town. There are bazaars and
markets on both sides of the river. The shopkeepers are chiefly
Armenians, Turks, and Jews. A most important fact connected with
these traders is, that Manchester and Glasgow goods that were taken
out by the Euphrates expedition as samples, were eagerly bought
by them, at a profit to the sellers of one hundred per cent. There
is much trade carried on in the town, both by camels from the
interior, and by boats laden with rice, dates, tobacco, and other
articles most in demand among the desert tribes. It would be
curious if, in the progress of commerce and civilisation, the neighbourhood
of Babylon should again become the scene of princely
mercantile traffic; it is described in the Revelations as having once
been (xviii. 12, 13), "The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious
stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and
scarlet, and all thyme wood, and all manner of vessels of ivory, and
all manner of vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron,
and marble, and cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense,
and wine, and oil, and flour, and wheat, and beasts, and
sheep, and horses, and chariots," &amp;c.</p></div>

through a noble portico of twelve circular columns; and the first
apartment in which the visiter finds himself is a magnificent hexagonal
hall, one hundred and eighty feet in diameter, exhibiting on
all sides the remains of an architectural beauty and magnificence of
the richest character, in the columns and other ornaments of a
circle of chambers which run around it. Beyond this is a still
larger court, of nearly a square form, being three hundred and
seventy-four feet in one direction, by three hundred and sixty-eight
feet in another, and at the farther extremity of that is the far-stretching
pillared structure forming the proper temple. As may
be observed from the view, nine of the lofty columns, which had
composed this part of the edifice, are still to be seen standing together.
There had been originally fifty-six in all, namely, ten at
each end, and eighteen others along each of the sides. The entire
length of the space which they include is two hundred and eighty-five
feet, and its breadth is one hundred and fifty-seven feet. The

in times past the continual benevolence of the people of Athens
towards the Byzantines and Perinthians, united by alliance and
their common origin, has never failed upon any occasion; that this
benevolence, so often signalised, has lately displayed itself, when
Philip of Macedon, who had taken up arms to destroy Byzantium
and Perinthus, battered our walls, burned our country, cut down
our forests; that in a season of so great calamity, this beneficent
people succoured us with a fleet of a hundred and twenty sail, furnished
with provisions, arms, and forces; that they saved us from
the greatest danger; in fine, that they restored us to the quiet
possession of our government, our laws, and our tombs: the
Byzantines grant, by decree, the Athenians to settle in the countries
belonging to Byzantium; to marry in them, to purchase lands,
and to enjoy all the prerogatives of citizens; they also grant them
a distinguished place at public shows, and the right of sitting both
in the senate and the assembly of the people, next to the pontiffs:
and further, that every Athenian, who shall think proper to settle
in either of the two cities above mentioned, shall be exempted from
taxes of any kind: that in the harbours, three statues of sixteen
cubits shall be set up, which statues shall represent the people of
Athens crowned by those of Byzantium and Perinthus: and besides,
that presents shall be sent to the four solemn games of Greece, and
that the crown we have decreed to the Athenians shall there be
proclaimed; so that the same ceremony may acquaint all the
Greeks, both with the magnanimity of the Athenians, and the gratitude
of the Byzantines."</p></div>

between Philip, son of Demetrius, king of Macedon, and the Carthaginians,
in which the great respect and veneration of the latter
for the deity, their inherent persuasion that the gods assist and
preside over human affairs, and particularly over the solemn treaties
made in their name and presence, are strongly displayed. Mention
is therein made of five or six different orders of deities; and this
enumeration appears very extraordinary in a public instrument, such
as a treaty of peace concluded between two nations. We will here
present our reader with the very words of the historian, as it will
give some idea of the Carthaginian theology. "This treaty was concluded
in the presence of Jupiter, Juno, and Apollo; in the presence
of the d&aelig;mon or genius (&#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#962;) of the Carthaginians, of Hercules
and Iolaus; in the presence of Mars, Triton, and Neptune; in the
presence of all the confederate gods of the Carthaginians; and of
the sun, the moon, and the earth; in the presence of the rivers,
meads, and waters, in the presence of all those gods who possess
Carthage."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rollin.</span></p></div>

agreement between the Romans and the Carthaginians, was performed
in this manner: the Carthaginians swore by the gods of
their country; and the Romans, after their ancient custom, swore
by a stone, and then by Mars. They swore by a stone thus:&mdash;
</p><p>
"If I keep my faith, may the gods vouchsafe their assistance, and
give me success; if, on the contrary, I violate it, then may the
other party be entirely safe, and preserved in their country, in their
laws, in their possessions, and, in a word, in all their rights and
liberties; and may I perish and fall alone, as now this stone does:"
and then he lets the stone fall out of his hands.
</p><p>
Livy's account of the like ceremony is something more particular;
yet differs little in substance, only that he says the herald's
concluding clause was, "otherwise may Jove strike the Roman people,
as I do this hog;" and accordingly he killed a hog that stood
ready by, with the stone which he held in his hand.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Kennett.</span></p></div>

body of young warriors, brought up together, at the public expense,
in the citadel. Their exercises and even their amusements were
regulated by the sounds of the flute, and in order to prevent their
courage from degenerating into blind fury, care was taken to inspire
them with the noblest and most animated sentiments. Each
warrior chose from the band a friend to whom he remained inseparably
united. These three hundred warriors were anciently distributed
in troops at the head of the different divisions of the army.

the east and north-east; the Caspian Sea and Mount Caucasus to
the north; and the river Euphrates to the west. The most

the shekel was inscribed Jerusalem Kedusha, <i>i. e.</i>, Jerusalem
the Holy. At length Jerusalem, for brevity's sake, was omitted,

greatest public work ever executed, either in ancient or modern
times. If we estimate its importance by the labour alone which has
been expended on it, perhaps the Great Chinese Wall might compete
with it; but when we consider the immense outlay of capital
which it has required,&mdash;the great and varied talents which have
been in a constant state of requisition during the whole of its progress,&mdash;together
with the unprecedented engineering difficulties,
which we are happy to say are now overcome,&mdash;the gigantic work of
the Chinese sinks totally into the shade.
</p><p>
It may be amusing to some readers, who are unacquainted with
the magnitude of such an undertaking as the London and Birmingham
Railway, if we give one or two illustrations of the above assertion.
The great pyramid of Egypt, that stupendous monument
which seems likely to exist to the end of all time, will afford a comparison.
</p><p>
After making the necessary allowances for the foundations,
galleries, &amp;c., and reducing the whole to one uniform denomination,
it will be found that the labour expended on the great <i>pyramid</i>
was equivalent to lifting fifteen thousand seven hundred and thirty-three
million cubic feet of stone one foot high. This labour was
performed, according to Diodoras Siculus by three hundred thousand,
to Herodotus by one hundred thousand men, and it required for its
execution twenty years.
</p><p>
If we reduce in the same manner the labour, expended in constructing
the London and Birmingham Railway, to one common
denomination, the result is twenty-five thousand million cubic feet
of material (reduced to the same weight as that used in constructing
the pyramid) lifted one foot high, or nine thousand two hundred and
sixty-seven million cubic feet more than was lifted one foot high in
the construction of the pyramid; yet this immense undertaking has
been performed by about twenty thousand men in less than five years.
</p><p>
From the above calculation have been omitted all the tunnelling,
culverts, drains, ballasting, and fencing, and all the heavy work at
the various stations, and also the labour expended on engines, carriages,
wagons, &amp;c. These are set off against the labour of drawing
the materials of the pyramid from the quarries to the spot where
they were to be used&mdash;a much larger allowance than is necessary.
</p><p>
As another means of comparison, let us take the cost of the
railway and turn it into pence, and allowing each penny to be one
inch and thirty-four hundredths wide, it will be found that these
pence laid together, so that they all touch, would more than form a
continuous band round the earth at the equator.
</p><p>
As a third mode of viewing the magnitude of this work, let us
take the circumference of the earth in round numbers at one hundred
and thirty million feet. Then, as there are about four hundred
million cubic feet of earth to be moved in the railway, we see that
this quantity of material alone, without looking to any thing else,
would, if spread in a band one foot high and one foot broad, more
than three times encompass the earth at the equator.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lecount.</span></p></div>

from the Google Print project.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
