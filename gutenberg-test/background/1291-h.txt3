      CHAPTER I
    
    
      In the eastern side of the Dead Sea rose the citadel of Machaerus. It was
      built upon a conical peak of basalt, and was surrounded by four deep
      valleys, one on each side, another in front, and the fourth in the rear.
      At the base of the citadel, crowding against one another, a group of
      houses stood within the circle of a wall, whose outlines undulated with
      the unevenness of the soil. A zigzag road, cutting through the rocks,
      joined the city to the fortress, the walls of which were about one hundred
      and twenty cubits high, having numerous angles and ornamental towers that
      stood out like jewels in this crown of stone overhanging an abyss.
    
    
      Within the high walls stood a palace, adorned with many richly carved
      arches, and surrounded by a terrace that on one side of the building
      spread out below a wide balcony made of sycamore wood, upon which tall
      poles had been erected to support an awning.
    
    
      One morning, just before sunrise, the tetrarch, Herod-Antipas, came out
      alone upon the balcony. He leaned against one of the columns and looked
      about him.
    
    
      The crests of the hill-tops in the valley below the palace were just
      discernible in the light of the false dawn, although their bases,
      extending to the abyss, were still plunged in darkness. A light mist
      floated in the air; presently it lifted, and the shores of the Dead Sea
      became visible. The sun, rising behind Machaerus, spread a rosy flush over
      the sky, lighting up the stony shores, the hills, and the desert, and
      illuming the distant mountains of Judea, rugged and grey in the early
      dawn. En-gedi, the central point of the group, threw a deep black shadow;
      Hebron, in the background, was round-topped like a dome; Eschol had her
      pomegranates, Sorek her vineyards, Carmel her fields of sesame; and the
      tower of Antonia, with its enormous cube, dominated Jerusalem. The
      tetrarch turned his gaze from it to contemplate the palms of Jericho on
      his right; and his thoughts dwelt upon other cities of his beloved
      Galilee,&mdash;Capernaum, Endor, Nazareth, Tiberias&mdash;whither it might
      be he would never return.
    
    
      The Jordan wound its way through the arid plains that met his gaze; white
      and glittering under the clear sky, it dazzled the eye like snow in the
      rays of the sun.
    
    
      The Dead Sea now looked like a sheet of lapis-lazuli; and at its southern
      extremity, on the coast of Yemen, Antipas recognised clearly what at first
      he had been able only dimly to perceive. Several tents could now be
      plainly seen; men carrying spears were moving about among a group of
      horses; and dying camp-fires shone faintly in the beams of the rising sun.
    
    
      This was a troop belonging to the sheikh of the Arabs, the daughter of
      whom the tetrarch had repudiated in order to wed Herodias, already married
      to one of his brothers, who lived in Italy but who had no pretensions to
      power.
    
    
      Antipas was waiting for assistance and reinforcements from the Romans, but
      as Vitellius, the Governor of Syria, had not yet arrived, he was consumed
      with impatience and anxiety. Perhaps Agrippa had ruined his cause with the
      Emperor, he thought. Philip, his third brother, sovereign of Batania, was
      arming himself clandestinely. The Jews were becoming intolerant of the
      tetrarch's idolatries; he knew that many were weary of his rule; and he
      hesitated now between adopting one of two projects: to conciliate the
      Arabs and win back their allegiance, or to conclude an alliance with the
      Parthians. Under the pretext of celebrating his birthday, he had planned
      to bring together, at a grand banquet, the chiefs of his troops, the
      stewards of his domains, and the most important men from the region about
      Galilee.
    
    
      Antipas threw a keen glance along all the roads leading to Machaerus. They
      were deserted. Eagles were sweeping through the air high above his head;
      the soldiers of the guard, placed at intervals along the ramparts, slept
      or dozed, leaning against the walls; all was silent within the castle.
    
    
      Suddenly he heard the sound of a distant voice, seeming to come from the
      very depths of the earth. His cheek paled. After an instant's hesitation,
      he leaned far over the balcony railing, listening intently, but the voice
      had died away. Presently it rose again upon the quiet air; Antipas clapped
      his hands together loudly, crying: "Mannaeus! Mannaeus!"
    
    
      Instantly a man appeared, naked to the waist, after the fashion of a
      masseur at the bath. Although emaciated, and somewhat advanced in years,
      he was a giant in stature, and on his hip he wore a cutlass in a bronze
      scabbard. His bushy hair, gathered up and held in place by a kind of comb,
      exaggerated the apparent size of his massive head. His eyes were heavy
      with sleep, but his white teeth shone, his step was light on the
      flagstones, and his body had the suppleness of an ape, although his
      countenance was as impassive as that of a mummy.
    
    
      "Where is he?" demanded the tetrarch of this strange being.
    
    
      Mannaeus made a movement over his shoulder with his thumb, saying:
    
    
      "Over there&mdash;still there!"
    
    
      "I thought I heard him cry out."
    
    
      And Antipas, after drawing a deep breath, asked for news of Iaokanann,
      afterwards known as St. John the Baptist. Had he been allowed to see the
      two men who had asked permission to visit his dungeon a few days before,
      and since that time, had any one discovered for what purpose the men
      desired to see him?
    
    
      "They exchanged some strange words with him," Mannaeus replied, "with the
      mysterious air of robbers conspiring at the cross-roads. Then they
      departed towards Upper Galilee, saying that they were the bearers of great
      tidings."
    
    
      Antipas bent his head for a moment; then raising it quickly, said in a
      tone full of alarm:
    
    
      "Guard him! watch him well! Do not allow any one else to see him. Keep the
      gates shut and the entrance to the dungeon closed fast. It must not even
      be suspected that he still lives!"
    
    
      Mannaeus had already attended to all these details, because Iaokanann was
      a Jew, and, like all the Samaritans, Mannaeus hated the Jews.
    
    
      Their temple on the Mount of Gerizim, which Moses had designed to be the
      centre of Israel, had been destroyed since the reign of King Hyrcanus; and
      the temple at Jerusalem made the Samaritans furious; they regarded its
      presence as an outrage against themselves, and a permanent injustice.
      Mannaeus, indeed, had forcibly entered it, for the purpose of defiling its
      altar with the bones of corpses. Several of his companions, less agile
      than he, had been caught and beheaded.
    
    
      From the tetrarch's balcony, the temple was visible through an opening
      between two hills. The sun, now fully risen, shed a dazzling splendour on
      its walls of snowy marble and the plates of purest gold that formed its
      roof. The structure shone like a luminous mountain, and its radiant purity
      indicated something almost superhuman, eclipsing even its suggestion of
      opulence and pride.
    
    
      Mannaeus stretched out his powerful arm towards Zion, and, with clenched
      fist and his great body drawn to its full height, he launched a bitter
      anathema at the city, with perfect faith that eventually his curse must be
      effective.
    
    
      Antipas listened, without appearing to be shocked at the strength of the
      invectives.
    
    
      When the Samaritan had become somewhat calmer, he returned to the subject
      of the prisoner.
    
    
      "Sometimes he grows excited," said he, "then he longs to escape or talks
      about a speedy deliverance. At other times he is as quiet as a sick
      animal, although I often find him pacing to and fro in his gloomy dungeon,
      murmuring, 'In order that His glory may increase, mine must diminish.'"
    
    
      Antipas and Mannaeus looked at each other a moment in silence. But the
      tetrarch was weary of pondering on this troublesome matter.
    
    
      The mountain peaks surrounding the palace, looking like great petrified
      waves, the black depths among the cliffs, the immensity of the blue sky,
      the rising sun, and the gloomy valley of the abyss, filled the soul of
      Antipas with a vague unrest; he felt an overwhelming sense of oppression
      at the sight of the desert, whose uneven piles of sand suggested crumbling
      amphitheaters or ruined palaces. The hot wind brought an odour of sulphur,
      as if it had rolled up from cities accursed and buried deeper than the
      river-bed of the slow-running Jordan.
    
    
      These aspects of nature, which seemed to his troubled fancy signs of the
      wrath of the gods, terrified him, and he leaned heavily against the
      balcony railing, his eyes fixed, his head resting upon his hands.
    
    
      Presently he felt a light touch upon his shoulder. He turned, and saw
      Herodias standing beside him. A purple robe enveloped her, falling to her
      sandaled feet. Having left her chamber hurriedly, she wore no jewels nor
      other ornaments. A thick tress of rippling black hair hung over her
      shoulder and hid itself in her bosom; her nostrils, a little too large for
      beauty, quivered with triumph, and her face was alight with joy. She
      gently shook the tetrarch's shoulder, and exclaimed exultantly:
    
    
      "Caesar is our friend! Agrippa has been imprisoned!"
    
    
      "Who told thee that?"
    
    
      "I know it!" she replied, adding: "It was because he coveted the crown of
      Caligula."
    
    
      While living upon the charity of Antipas and Herodias, Agrippa had
      intrigued to become king, a title for which the tetrarch was as eager as
      he. But if this news were true, no more was to be feared from Agrippa's
      scheming.
    
    
      "The dungeons of Tiberias are hard to open, and sometimes life itself is
      uncertain within their depths," said Herodias, with grim significance.
    
    
      Antipas understood her; and, although she was Agrippa's sister, her
      atrocious insinuation seemed entirely justifiable to the tetrarch. Murder
      and outrage were to be expected in the management of political intrigues;
      they were a part of the fatal inheritance of royal houses; and in the
      family of Herodias nothing was more common.
    
    
      Then she rapidly unfolded to the tetrarch the secrets of her recent
      undertakings, telling him how many men had been bribed, what letters had
      been intercepted, and the number of spies stationed at the city gates. She
      did not hesitate even to tell him of her success in an attempt to befool
      and seduce Eutyches the denunciator.
    
    
      "And why should I not?" she said; "it cost me nothing. For thee, my lord,
      have I not done more than that? Did I not even abandon my child?"
    
    
      After her divorce from Philip, she had indeed left her daughter in Rome,
      hoping that, as the wife of the tetrarch, she might bear other children.
      Until that moment she had never spoken to Antipas of her daughter. He
      asked himself the reason for this sudden display of tenderness.
    
    
      During their brief conversation several attendants had come out upon the
      balcony; one slave brought a quantity of large, soft cushions, and
      arranged them in a kind of temporary couch upon the floor behind his
      mistress. Herodias sank upon them, and turning her face away from Antipas,
      seemed to be weeping silently. After a few moments she dried her eyes,
      declared that she would dream no more, and that she was, in reality,
      perfectly happy. She reminded Antipas of their former long delightful
      interviews in the atrium; their meetings at the baths; their walks along
      the Sacred Way, and the sweet evening rendezvous at the villa, among the
      flowery groves, listening to the murmur of splashing fountains, within
      sight of the Roman Campagna. Her glances were as tender as in former days;
      she drew near to him, leaned against his breast and caressed him fondly.
    
    
      But he repelled her soft advances. The love she sought to rekindle had
      died long ago. He thought instead of all his misfortunes, and of the
      twelve long years during which the war had continued. Protracted anxiety
      had visibly aged the tetrarch. His shoulders were bent beneath his
      violet-bordered toga; his whitening locks were long and mingled with his
      beard, and the sunlight revealed many lines upon his brow, as well as upon
      that of Herodias. After the tetrarch's repulse of his wife's tender
      overtures, the pair gazed morosely at each other.
    
    
      The mountain paths began to show signs of life. Shepherds were driving
      their flocks to pasture; children urged heavy-laden donkeys along the
      roads; while grooms belonging to the palace led the horses to the river to
      drink. The wayfarers descending from the heights on the farther side of
      Machaerus disappeared behind the castle; others ascended from the valleys,
      and after arriving at the palace deposited their burdens in the courtyard.
      Many of these were purveyors to the tetrarch; others were the servants of
      his expected guests, arriving in advance of their masters.
    
    
      Suddenly, at the foot of the terrace on the left, an Essene appeared; he
      wore a white robe, his feet were bare, and his demeanour indicated that he
      was a follower of the Stoics. Mannaeus instantly rushed towards the
      stranger, drawing the cutlass that he wore upon his hip.
    
    
      "Kill him!" cried Herodias.
    
    
      "Do not touch him!" the tetrarch commanded.
    
    
      The two men stood motionless for an instant, then they descended the
      terrace, both taking a different direction, although they kept their eyes
      fixed upon each other.
    
    
      "I know that man," said Herodias, after they had disappeared. "His name is
      Phanuel, and he will try to seek out Iaokanann, since thou wert so foolish
      as to allow him to live."
    
    
      Antipas said that the man might some day be useful to them. His attacks
      upon Jerusalem would gain them the allegiance of the rest of the Jews.
    
    
      "No," said Herodias, "the Jews will accept any master, and are incapable
      of feeling any true patriotism." She added that, as for the man who was
      trying to influence the people with hopes cherished since the days of
      Nehemiah, the best policy was to suppress him.
    
    
      The tetrarch replied that there was no haste about the matter, and
      expressed his doubt that any real danger was to be feared from Iaokanann
      even affecting to laugh at the idea.
    
    
      "Do not deceive thyself!" exclaimed Herodias. And she retold the story of
      her humiliation one day when she was travelling towards Gilead, in order
      to purchase some of the balm for which that region was famous.
    
    
      "A multitude was standing on the banks of the stream, my lord; many of the
      people were putting on their raiment. Standing on a hillock, a strange man
      was speaking to the gathering. A camel's-skin was wrapped about his loins,
      and his head was like that of a lion. As soon as he saw me, he launched in
      my direction all the maledictions of the prophets. His eyes flamed, his
      voice shook, he raised his arms as if he would draw down lightning upon my
      head. I could not fly from him; the wheels of my chariot sank in the sand
      up to the middle; and I could only crawl along, hiding my head with my
      mantle, and frozen with terror at the curses that poured upon me like a
      storm from heaven!"
    
    
      Continuing her harangue, she declared that the knowledge that this man
      still existed poisoned her very life. When he had been seized and bound
      with cords, the soldiers were prepared to stab him if he resisted, but he
      had been quite gentle and obedient. After he had been thrown into prison
      some one had put venomous serpents into his dungeon, but strange to say,
      after a time they had died, leaving him uninjured. The inanity of such
      tricks exasperated Herodias. Besides, she inquired, why did this man make
      war upon her? What interest moved him to such actions? His injurious words
      to her, uttered before a throng of listeners, had been repeated and widely
      circulated; she heard them whispered everywhere. Against a legion of
      soldiers she would have been brave; but this mysterious influence, more
      pernicious and powerful than the sword, but impossible to grasp, was
      maddening! Herodias strode to and fro upon the terrace, white with rage,
      unable to find words to express the emotions that choked her.
    
    
      She had a haunting fear that the tetrarch might listen to public opinion
      after a time, and persuade himself it was his duty to repudiate her. Then,
      indeed, all would be lost! Since early youth she had cherished a dream
      that some day she would rule over a great empire. As an important step
      towards attaining this ambition, she had deserted Philip, her first
      husband, and married the tetrarch, who now she thought had duped her.
    
    
      "Ah! I found a powerful support, indeed, when I entered thy family!" she
      sneered.
    
    
      "It is at least the equal of thine," Antipas replied.
    
    
      Herodias felt the blood of the kings and priests, her ancestors, boiling
      in her veins.
    
    
      "Thy grandfather was a servile attendant upon the temple of Ascalon!" she
      went on, with fury. "Thy other ancestors were shepherds, bandits,
      conductors of caravans, a horde of slaves offered as tribute to King
      David! My forefathers were the conquerors of thine! The first of the
      Maccabees drove thy people out of Hebron; Hyrcanus forced them to be
      circumcised!" Then, with all the contempt of the patrician for the
      plebeian, the hatred of Jacob for Esau, she reproached him for his
      indifference towards palpable outrages to his dignity, his weakness
      regarding the Phoenicians, who had been false to him, and his cowardly
      attitude towards the people who detested and insulted herself.
    
    
      "But thou art like them!" she cried; "Dost regret the loss of the Arab
      girl who danced upon these very pavements? Take her back! Go and live with
      her&mdash;in her tent! Eat her bread, baked in the ashes! Drink curdled
      sheep's-milk! Kiss her dark cheeks&mdash;and forget me!"
    
    
      The tetrarch had already forgotten her presence, it appeared. He paid no
      further heed to her anger, but looked intently at a young girl who had
      just stepped out upon the balcony of a house not far away. At her side
      stood an elderly female slave, who held over the girl's head a kind of
      parasol with a handle made of long, slender reeds. In the middle of the
      rug spread upon the floor of the balcony stood a large open
      travelling-hamper or basket, and girdles, veils, head-dresses, and gold
      and silver ornaments were scattered about in confusion. At intervals the
      young girl took one object or another in her hands, and held it up
      admiringly. She was dressed in the costume of the Roman ladies, with a
      flowing tunic and a peplum ornamented with tassels of emeralds; and blue
      silken bands confined her hair, which seemed almost too luxuriant, since
      from time to time she raised a small hand to push back the heavy masses.
      The parasol half hid the maiden from the gaze of Antipas, but now and then
      he caught a glimpse of her delicate neck, her large eyes, or a fleeting
      smile upon her small mouth. He noted that her figure swayed about with a
      singularly elastic grace and elegance. He leaned forward, his eyes
      kindled, his breath quickened. All this was not lost upon Herodias, who
      watched him narrowly.
    
    
      "Who is that maiden?" the tetrarch asked at last.
    
    
      Herodias replied that she did not know, and her fierce demeanour suddenly
      changed to one of gentleness and amiability.
    
    
      At the entrance to the castle the tetrarch was awaited by several
      Galileans, the master of the scribes, the chief of the land stewards, the
      manager of the salt mines, and a Jew from Babylon, commanding his troops
      of horse. As the tetrarch approached the group, he was greeted with
      respectful enthusiasm. Acknowledging the acclamations with a grave salute,
      he entered the castle.
    
    
      As he proceeded along one of the corridors, Phanuel suddenly sprang from a
      corner and intercepted him.
    
    
      "What! Art thou still here?" said the tetrarch in displeasure. "Thou
      seekest Iaokanann, no doubt."
    
    
      "And thyself, my lord. I have something of great importance to tell thee."
    
    
      At a sign from Antipas, the Essene followed him into a somewhat dark and
      gloomy room.
    
    
      The daylight came faintly through a grated window. The walls were of a
      deep shade of crimson, so dark as to look almost black. At one end of the
      room stood an ebony bed, ornamented with bands of leather. A shield of
      gold, hanging at the head of the bed, shone like a sun in the obscurity of
      the apartment. Antipas crossed over to the couch and threw himself upon it
      in a half-reclining attitude, while Phanuel remained standing before him.
      Suddenly he raised one hand, and striking a commanding attitude said:
    
    
      "At times, my lord, the Most High sends a message to the people through
      one of His sons. Iaokanann is one of these. If thou oppress him, thou
      shalt be punished!"
    
    
      "But it is he that persecutes me!" exclaimed Antipas. "He asked me to do a
      thing that was impossible. Since then he has done nothing but revile me.
      And I was not severe with him when he began his abuse of me. But he had
      the hardihood to send various men from Machaerus to spread dissension and
      discontent throughout my domain. A curse upon him! Since he attacks me, I
      shall defend myself."
    
    
      "Without doubt, he has expressed his anger with too much violence,"
      Phanuel replied calmly. "But do not heed that further. He must be set
      free."
    
    
      "One does not let loose a furious animal," said the tetrarch.
    
    
      "Have no fear of him now," was the quick reply. "He will go straight to
      the Arabs, the Gauls, and the Scythians. His work must be extended to the
      uttermost ends of the earth."
    
    
      For a moment Antipas appeared lost in thought, as one who sees a vision.
      Then he said:
    
    
      "His power over men is indeed great. In spite of myself, I admire him!"
    
    
      "Then set him free!"
    
    
      But the tetrarch shook his head. He feared Herodias, Mannaeus, and unknown
      dangers.
    
    
      Phanuel tried to persuade him, promising, as a guaranty of the honesty of
      his projects, the submission of the Essenians to the King. These poor
      people, clad only in linen, untameable in spite of severe treatment,
      endowed with the power to divine the future by reading the stars, had
      succeeded in commanding a certain degree of respect.
    
    
      "What is the important matter thou wouldst communicate to me?" Antipas
      inquired, with sudden recollection.
    
    
      Before Phanuel could reply, a Negro entered the room in great haste. He
      was covered with dust, and panted so violently that he could scarcely
      utter the single word:
    
    
      "Vitellus!"
    
    
      "Has he arrived?" asked the tetrarch.
    
    
      "I have seen him, my lord. Within three hours he will be here."
    
    
      Throughout the palace, doors were opening and closing and portieres were
      swaying as if in a high wind, with the coming and going of many persons;
      there was a murmur of voices; sounds of the moving of heavy furniture
      could be heard, and the rattle of silver plates and dishes. From the
      highest tower a loud blast upon a conch summoned from far and near all the
      slaves belonging to the castle.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER II
    
    
      The ramparts were thronged with people when at last Vitellius entered the
      castle gates, leaning on the arm of his interpreter. Behind them came an
      imposing red litter, decorated with plumes and mirrors. The proconsul wore
      a toga ornamented with the laticlave, a broad purple band extending down
      the front of the garment, indicating his rank; and his feet were encased
      in the kind of buskins worn by consuls. A guard of lictors surrounded him.
      Against the wall they placed their twelve fasces&mdash;a bundle of sticks
      with an axe in the centre. And the populace trembled before the insignia
      of Roman majesty.
    
    
      The gorgeous litter, borne by eight men, came to a halt. From it descended
      a youth. He wore many pearls upon his fingers, but he had a protruding
      abdomen and his face was covered with pimples. A cup of aromatic wine was
      offered to him. He drank it, and asked for a second draught.
    
    
      The tetrarch had fallen upon his knees before the proconsul, saying that
      he was grieved beyond words not to have known sooner of the favour of his
      presence within those domains; had he been aware of the approach of his
      distinguished guest, he would have issued a command that every person
      along the route should place himself at the proconsul's orders. Of a
      surety, the proconsul's family was descended direct from the goddess
      Vitellia. A highway, leading from the Janiculum to the sea, still bore
      their name. Questors and consuls were innumerable in that great family;
      and as for the noble Lucius, now his honoured guest, it was the duty of
      the whole people to thank him, as the conqueror of the Cliti and the
      father of the young Aulus, now returning to his own domain, since the East
      was the country of the gods. These hyperboles were expressed in Latin, and
      Vitellius accepted them impassively.
    
    
      He replied that the great Herod was the honour and glory of the nation;
      that the Athenians had chosen him to direct the Olympian games; that he
      had built temples in the honour of Augustus; had been patient, ingenious,
      terrible; and was faithful to all the Caesars.
    
    
      Between the two marble columns, with bronze capitals, Herodias could now
      be seen advancing with the air of an empress, in the midst of a group of
      women and eunuchs carrying perfumed torches set in sockets of silver-gilt.
    
    
      The proconsul advanced three steps to meet her. She saluted him with an
      inclination of her head.
    
    
      "How fortunate," she exclaimed, "that henceforth Agrippa, the enemy of
      Tiberius, can work harm no longer!"
    
    
      Vitellius did not understand her allusion, but he thought her a dangerous
      woman. Antipas immediately declared that he was ready to do anything for
      the emperor.
    
    
      "Even to the injury of others?" Vitellius asked, significantly.
    
    
      He had taken hostages from the king of the Parthians, but the emperor had
      given no further thought to the matter, because Antipas, who had been
      present at the conference, had, in order to gain favour, sent off
      despatches bearing the news. From that time he had borne a profound hatred
      towards the emperor and had delayed in sending assistance to him.
    
    
      The tetrarch stammered in attempting to reply to the query of the
      proconsul. But Aulus laughed and said: "Do not be disturbed. I will
      protect thee!"
    
    
      The proconsul feigned not to hear this remark. The fortune of the father
      depended, in a way, on the corrupt influence of the son; and through him
      it was possible that Antipas might be able to procure for the proconsul
      very substantial benefits, although the glances that he cast about him
      were defiant, and even venomous.
    
    
      But now a new tumult arose just within the gates. A file of white mules
      entered the courtyard, mounted by men in priestly garb. These were the
      Sadducees and the Pharisees, who were drawn to Machaerus by the same
      ambition: the one party hoping to be appointed public sacrificers, the
      other determined to retain those offices. Their faces were dark,
      particularly those of the Pharisees, who were enemies of Rome and of the
      tetrarch. The flowing skirts of their tunics embarrassed their movements
      as they attempted to pass through the throng; and their tiaras sat
      unsteadily upon their brows, around which were bound small bands of
      parchment, showing lines of writing.
    
    
      Almost at the same moment, the soldiers of the advance guard arrived.
      Cloth coverings had been drawn over their glittering shields to protect
      them from the dust. Behind them came Marcellus, the proconsul's
      lieutenant, followed by the publicans, carrying their tablets of wood
      under their arms.
    
    
      Antipas named to Vitellius the principle personages surrounding them:
      Tolmai, Kanthera, Schon, Ammonius of Alexandria, who brought asphalt for
      Antipas; Naaman, captain of his troops of skirmishers, and Jacim, the
      Babylonian.
    
    
      Vitellius had noticed Mannaeus.
    
    
      "Who is that man?" he inquired.
    
    
      The tetrarch by a significant gesture indicated that Mannaeus was the
      executioner. He then presented the Sadducees to the proconsul's notice.
    
    
      Jonathas, a man of low stature, who spoke Greek, advanced with a firm step
      and begged that the great lord would honour Jerusalem with a visit.
      Vitellius replied that he should probably go to Jerusalem soon.
    
    
      Eleazar, who had a crooked nose and a long beard, put forth a claim, in
      behalf of the Pharisees, for the mantle of the high priest, held in the
      tower of Antonia by the civil authorities.
    
    
      Then the Galileans came forward and denounced Pontius Pilate. On one
      occasion, they said, a mad-man went seeking in a cave near Samaria for the
      golden vases that had belonged to King David, and Pontius Pilate had
      caused several inhabitants of that region to be executed. In their
      excitement all the Galileans spoke at once, Mannaeus's voice being heard
      above all others. Vitellius promised that the guilty ones should be
      punished.
    
    
      Fresh vociferations now broke out in front of the great gates, where the
      soldiers had hung their shields. Their coverings having now been removed,
      on each shield a carving of the head of Caesar could be seen on the umbo,
      or central knob. To the Jews, this seemed an evidence of nothing short of
      idolatry. Antipas harangued them, while Vitellius, who occupied a raised
      seat within the shadow of the colonnade, was astonished at their fury.
      Tiberius had done well, he thought, to exile four hundred of these people
      to Sardinia. Presently the Jews became so violent that he ordered the
      shields to be removed.
    
    
      Then the multitude surrounded the proconsul, imploring him to abolish
      certain unjust laws, asking for privileges, or begging for alms. They rent
      their clothing and jostled one another; and at last, in order to drive
      them back, several slaves, armed with long staves, charged upon them,
      striking right and left. Those nearest the gates made their escape and
      descended to the road; others rushed in to take their place, so that two
      streams of human beings flowed in and out, compressed within the limits of
      the gateway.
    
    
      Vitellius demanded the reason for the assembling of so great a throng.
      Antipas explained that they had been invited to come to a feast in
      celebration of his birthday; and he pointed to several men who, leaning
      against the battlements, were hauling up immense basket-loads of food,
      fruits, vegetables, antelopes, and storks; large fish, of a brilliant
      shade of blue; grapes, melons, and pyramids of pomegranates. At this
      sight, Aulus left the courtyard and hastened to the kitchens, led by his
      taste for gormandizing, which later became the amazement of the world.
    
    
      As they passed the opening to a small cellar, Vitellius perceived some
      objects resembling breast-plates hanging on a wall. He looked at them with
      interest, and then demanded that the subterranean chambers of the fortress
      be thrown open for his inspection. These chambers were cut into the rocky
      foundation of the castle, and had been formed into vaults, with pillars
      set at regular distances. The first vault opened contained old armour; the
      second was full of pikes, with long points emerging from tufts of
      feathers. The walls of the third chamber were hung with a kind of tapestry
      made of slender reeds, laid in perpendicular rows. Those of the fourth
      were covered with scimitars. In the middle of the fifth cell, rows of
      helmets were seen, the crests of which looked like a battalion of fiery
      serpents. The sixth cell contained nothing but empty quivers; the seventh,
      greaves for protecting the legs in battle; the eighth vault was filled
      with bracelets and armlets; and an examination of the remaining vaults
      disclosed forks, grappling-irons, ladders, cords, even catapults, and
      bells for the necks of camels; and as they descended deeper into the rocky
      foundation, it became evident that the whole mass was a veritable
      honeycomb of cells, and that below those already seen were many others.
    
    
      Vitellius, Phineas, his interpreter, and Sisenna, chief of the publicans,
      walked among these gloomy cells, attended by three eunuchs bearing
      torches.
    
    
      In the deep shadows hideous instruments, invented by barbarians, could be
      seen: tomahawks studded with nails; poisoned javelins; pincers resembling
      the jaws of crocodiles; in short, the tetrarch possessed in his castle
      munitions of war sufficient for forty thousand men.
    
    
      He had accumulated these weapons in anticipation of an alliance against
      him among his enemies. But he bethought him that the proconsul might
      believe, or assert, that he had collected this armoury in order to attack
      the Romans; so he hastened to offer explanations of all that Vitellius had
      observed.
    
    
      Some of these things did not belong to him at all, he said: many of them
      were necessary to defend the place against brigands and marauders,
      especially the Arabs. Many of the objects in the vault had been the
      property of his father, and he had allowed them to remain untouched. As he
      spoke, he managed to get in advance of the proconsul and preceded him
      along the corridors with rapid steps. Presently he halted and stood close
      against the wall as the party came up; he spoke quickly, standing with his
      hands on his hips, so that his voluminous mantle covered a wide space of
      the wall behind him. But just above his head the top of a door was
      visible. Vitellius remarked it instantly, and demanded to know what it
      concealed.
    
    
      The tetrarch explained that the door was fastened, and that none could
      open it save the Babylonian, Jacim.
    
    
      "Summon him, then!" was the command.
    
    
      A slave was sent to find Jacim, while the group awaited his coming.
    
    
      The father of Jacim had come from the banks of the Euphrates to offer his
      services, as well as those of five hundred horsemen, in the defence of the
      eastern frontier. After the division of the kingdom, Jacim had lived for a
      time with Philip, and was now in the service of Antipas.
    
    
      Presently he appeared among the vaults, carrying an archer's bow on his
      shoulder and a whip in his hand. Cords of many colours were lashed tightly
      about his knotted legs; his massive arms were thrust through a sleeveless
      tunic, and a fur cap shaded his face. His chin was covered with a heavy,
      curling beard.
    
    
      He appeared not to comprehend what the interpreter said to him at first.
      But Vitellius threw a meaning glance at Antipas, who quickly made the
      Babylonian understand the command of the proconsul. Jacim immediately laid
      both his hands against the door, giving it a powerful shove; whereupon it
      quietly slid out of sight into the wall.
    
    
      A wave of hot air surged from the depths of the cavern. A winding path
      descended and turned abruptly. The group followed it, and soon arrived at
      the threshold of a kind of grotto, somewhat larger than the other
      subterranean cells.
    
    
      An arched window at the back of this chamber gave directly upon a
      precipice, which formed a defence for one side of the castle. A
      honeysuckle vine, cramped by the low-studded ceiling, blossomed bravely.
      The sound of a running stream could be heard distinctly. In this place was
      a great number of beautiful white horses, perhaps a hundred. They were
      eating barley from a plank placed on a level with their mouths. Their
      manes had been coloured a deep blue; their hoofs were wrapped in coverings
      of woven grass, and the hair between their ears was puffed out like a
      peruke. As they stood quietly eating, they switched their tails gently to
      and fro. The proconsul regarded them in silent admiration.
    
    
      They were indeed wonderful animals; supple as serpents, light as birds.
      They were trained to gallop rapidly, following the arrow of the rider, and
      dash into the midst of a group of the enemy, overturning men and biting
      them savagely as they fell. They were sure-footed among rocky passes, and
      would jump fearlessly over yawning chasms; and, while ready to gallop
      across the plains a whole day without tiring, they would stop instantly at
      the command of the rider.
    
    
      As soon as Jacim entered their quarters, they trotted up to him, as sheep
      crowd around the shepherd; and, thrusting forward their sleek necks, they
      looked at him with a gaze like that of inquiring children. From force of
      habit, he emitted a raucous cry, which excited them; they pranced about,
      impatient at their confinement and longing to run.
    
    
      Antipas, fearing that if Vitellius knew of the existence of these
      creatures, he would take them away, had shut them up in this place, made
      especially to accommodate animals in case of siege.
    
    
      "This close confinement cannot be good for them," said Vitellius, "and
      there is a risk of losing them by keeping them here. Make an inventory of
      their number, Sisenna."
    
    
      The publican drew a writing-tablet from the folds of his robe, counted the
      horses, and recorded the number carefully.
    
    
      It was the habit of the agents of the fiscal companies to corrupt the
      governors in order to pillage the provinces. Sisenna was among the most
      flourishing of these agents, and was seen everywhere with his claw-like
      fingers and his eyelids continually blinking.
    
    
      After a time the party returned to the court. Heavy, round bronze lids,
      sunk in the stones of the pavement, covered the cisterns of the palace.
      Vitellius noticed that one of these was larger than the others, and that
      when struck by his foot it had not their sonority. He struck them all, one
      after another; then stamped upon the ground and shouted:
    
    
      "I have found it! I have found the buried treasure of Herod!"
    
    
      Searching for buried treasure was a veritable mania among the Romans.
    
    
      The tetrarch swore that no treasure was hidden in that spot.
    
    
      "What is concealed there, then?" the proconsul demanded.
    
    
      "Nothing&mdash;that is, only a man&mdash;a prisoner."
    
    
      "Show him to me!"
    
    
      The tetrarch hesitated to obey, fearing that the Jews would discover his
      secret. His reluctance to lift the cover made Vitellius impatient.
    
    
      "Break it in!" he cried to his lictors. Mannaeus heard the command, and,
      seeing a lictor step forward armed with a hatchet, he feared that the man
      intended to behead Iaokanann. He stayed the hand of the lictor after the
      first blow, and then slipped between the heavy lid and the pavement a kind
      of hook. He braced his long, lean arms, raised the cover slowly, and in a
      moment it lay flat upon the stones. The bystanders admired the strength of
      the old man.
    
    
      Under the bronze lid was a wooden trap-door of the same size. At a blow of
      the fist it folded back, allowing a wide hole to be seen, the mouth of an
      immense pit, with a flight of winding steps leading down into the
      darkness. Those that bent over to peer into the cavern beheld a vague and
      terrifying shape in its depths.
    
    
      This proved to be a human being, lying on the ground. His long locks hung
      over a camel's-hair robe that covered his shoulders. Slowly he rose to his
      feet. His head touched a grating embedded in the wall; and as he moved
      about he disappeared, from time to time, in the shadows of his dungeon.
    
    
      The rich tiaras of the Romans sparkled brilliantly in the sunlight, and
      their glittering sword-hilts threw out glancing golden rays. The doves,
      flying from their cotes, circled above the heads of the multitude. It was
      the hour when Mannaeus was accustomed to feed them. But now he crouched
      beside the tetrarch, who stood near Vitellius. The Galileans, the priests,
      and the soldiers formed a group behind them; all were silent, waiting with
      painful anticipation for what might happen.
    
    
      A deep groan, hollow and startling, rose from the pit.
    
    
      Herodias heard it from the farther end of the palace. Drawn by an
      irresistible though terrible fascination, she made her way through the
      throng, and, reaching Mannaeus, she leant one hand on his shoulder and
      bent over to listen.
    
    
      The hollow voice rose again from the depths of the earth.
    
    
      "Woe to thee, Sadducees and Pharisees! Thy voices are like the tinkling of
      cymbals! O race of vipers, bursting with pride!"
    
    
      The voice of Iaokanann was recognised. His name was whispered about.
      Spectators from a distance pressed closer to the open pit.
    
    
      "Woe to thee, O people! Woe to the traitors of Judah, and to the drunkards
      of Ephraim, who dwelt in the fertile valleys and stagger with the fumes of
      wine!
    
    
      "May they disappear like running water; like the slug that sinks into the
      sand as it moves; like an abortion that never sees the light!
    
    
      "And thou too, Moab! hide thyself in the midst of the cypress, like the
      sparrow; in caverns, like the wild hare! The gates of the fortress shall
      be crushed more easily than nut-shells; the walls shall crumble; cities
      shall burn; and the scourge of God shall not cease! He shall cause your
      bodies to be bathed in your own blood, like wool in the dyer's vat. He
      shall rend you, as with a harrow; He shall scatter the remains of your
      bodies from the tops of the mountains!"
    
    
      Of which conqueror was he speaking? Was it Vitellius? Only the Romans
      could bring about such an extermination. The people began to cry out:
      "Enough! enough! let him speak no more!"
    
    
      But the prisoner continued in louder tones:
    
    
      "Beside the corpses of their mothers, thy little ones shall drag
      themselves over the ashes of the burned cities. At night men will creep
      from their hiding-places to seek a bit of food among the ruins, even at
      the risk of being cut down with the sword. Jackals shall pick thy bones in
      the public places, where at eventide the fathers were wont to gather. At
      the bidding of Gentiles, thy maidens shall be forced to cease their
      lamentations and to make music upon the zither, and the bravest of thy
      sons shall learn to bend their backs, chafed with heavy burdens."
    
    
      The listeners remembered the days of exile, and all the misfortunes and
      catastrophes of the past. These words were like the anathemas of the
      ancient prophets. The captive thundered them forth like bolts from heaven.
    
    
      Presently his voice became almost as sweet and harmonious as if he were
      uttering a chant. He spoke of the world's redemption from sin and sorrow;
      of the glories of heaven; of gold in place of clay; of the desert
      blossoming like the rose. "That which is now worth sixty pieces of silver
      will not cost a single obol. Fountains of milk shall spring from the
      rocks; men shall sleep, well satisfied, among the wine-presses. The people
      shall prostrate themselves before Thee, and Thy reign shall be eternal, O
      Son of David!"
    
    
      The tetrarch suddenly recoiled from the opening of the pit; the mention of
      the existence of a son of David seemed to him like a menace to himself.
    
    
      Iaokanann then poured forth invectives against him for presuming to aspire
      to royalty.
    
    
      "There is no other king than the Eternal God!" he cried; and he cursed
      Antipas for his luxurious gardens, his statues, his furniture of carved
      ivory and precious woods, comparing him to the impious Ahab.
    
    
      Antipas broke the slender cord attached to the royal seal that he wore
      around his neck, and throwing the seal into the pit, he commanded his
      prisoner to be silent.
    
    
      But Iaokanann replied: "I shall cry aloud like a savage bear, like the
      wild ass, like a woman in travail! The punishment of heaven has already
      visited itself upon thy incest! May God inflict thee with the sterility of
      mules!"
    
    
      At these words, a sound of suppressed laughter arose here and there among
      the listeners.
    
    
      Vitellius had remained close to the opening of the dungeon while Iaokanann
      was speaking. His interpreter, in impassive tones, translated into the
      Roman tongue all the threats and invectives that rolled up from the depths
      of the gloomy prison. The tetrarch and Herodias felt compelled to remain
      near at hand. Antipas listened, breathing heavily; while the woman, with
      parted lips, gazed into the darkness of the pit, her face drawn with an
      expression of fear and hatred.
    
    
      The terrible man now turned towards her. He grasped the bars of his
      prison, pressed against them his bearded face, in which his eyes glowed
      like burning coals, and cried:
    
    
      "Ah! Is it thou, Jezebel? Thou hast captured thy lord's heart with the
      tinkling of thy feet. Thou didst neigh to him like a mare. Thou didst
      prepare thy bed on the mountain top, in order to accomplish thy
      sacrifices!
    
    
      "The Lord shall take from thee thy sparkling jewels, thy purple robes and
      fine linen; the bracelets from thine arms, the anklets from thy feet; the
      golden ornaments that dangle upon thy brow, thy mirrors of polished
      silver, thy fans of ostrich plumes, thy shoes with their heels of
      mother-of-pearl, that serve to increase thy stature; thy glittering
      diamonds, the scent of thy hair, the tint of thy nails,&mdash;all the
      artifices of thy coquetry shall disappear, and missiles shall be found
      wherewith to stone the adulteress!"
    
    
      Herodias looked around for some one to defend her. The Pharisees lowered
      their eyes hypocritically. The Sadducees turned away their heads, fearing
      to offend the proconsul should they appear to sympathise with her. Antipas
      was almost in a swoon.
    
    
      Louder still rose the voice from the dungeon; the neighbouring hills gave
      back an echo with startling effect, and Machaerus seemed actually
      surrounded and showered with curses.
    
    
      "Prostrate thyself in the dust, daughter of Babylon, and scourge thyself!
      Remove thy girdle and thy shoes, gather up thy garments and walk through
      the flowing stream; thy shame shall follow thee, thy disgrace shall be
      known to all men, thy bosom shall be rent with sobs. God execrates the
      stench of thy crimes! Accursed one! die like a dog!"
    
    
      At that instant the trap-door was suddenly shut down and secured by
      Mannaeus, who would have liked to strangle Iaokanann then and there.
    
    
      Herodias glided away and disappeared within the palace. The Pharisees were
      scandalised at what they had heard. Antipas, standing among them,
      attempted to justify his past conduct and to excuse his present situation.
    
    
      "Without doubt," said Eleazar, "it was necessary for him to marry his
      brother's wife; but Herodias was not a widow, and besides, she had a
      child, which she abandoned; and that was an abomination."
    
    
      "You are wrong," objected Jonathas the Sadducee; "the law condemns such
      marriages but does not actually forbid them."
    
    
      "What matters it? All the world shows me injustice," said Antipas,
      bitterly; "and why? Did not Absalom lie with his father's wives, Judah
      with his daughter-in-law, Ammon with his sister, and Lot with his
      daughters?"
    
    
      Aulus, who had been reposing within the palace, now reappeared in the
      court. After he had heard how matters stood, he approved of the attitude
      of the tetrarch. "A man should never allow himself to be annoyed," said
      he, "by such foolish criticism." And he laughed at the censure of the
      priests and the fury of Iaokanann, saying that his words were of little
      importance.
    
    
      Herodias, who also had reappeared, and now stood at the top of a flight of
      steps, called loudly:
    
    
      "You are wrong, my lord! He ordered the people to refuse to pay the tax!"
    
    
      "Is that true?" he demanded. The general response was affirmative, Antipas
      adding his word to the declaration of the others.
    
    
      Vitellius had a misgiving that the prisoner might be able to escape; and
      as the conduct of Antipas appeared to him rather suspicious, he
      established his own sentinels at the gates, at intervals along the walls,
      and in the courtyard itself.
    
    
      At last he retired to the apartments assigned to him, accompanied by the
      priests. Without touching directly upon the question of the coveted
      offices of public sacrificers, each one laid his own grievances before the
      proconsul. They fairly beset him with complaints and requests, but he soon
      dismissed them from his presence.
    
    
      As Jonathas left the proconsul's apartments he perceived Antipas standing
      under an arch, talking to an Essene, who wore a long white robe and
      flowing locks. Jonathas regretted that he had raised his voice in defence
      of the tetrarch.
    
    
      One thought now consoled Herod-Antipas. He was no longer personally
      responsible for the fate of Iaokanann. The Romans had assumed that charge.
      What a relief! He had noticed Phanuel pacing slowly through the court, and
      calling him to his side, he pointed put the guards established by
      Vitellius, saying:
    
    
      "They are stronger than I! I cannot now set the prisoner free! It is not
      my fault if he remains in his dungeon."
    
    
      The courtyard was empty. The slaves were sleeping. The day was drawing to
      a close, and the sunset spread a deep rosy glow over the horizon, against
      which the smallest objects stood out like silhouettes. Antipas was able to
      distinguish the excavations of the salt-mines at the farther end of the
      Dead Sea, but the tents of the Arabs were no longer visible. As the moon
      rose, the effect of the day's excitement passed away, and a feeling of
      peace entered his heart.
    
    
      Phanuel, also wearied by the recent agitating scenes, remained beside the
      tetrarch. He sat in silence for some time, his chin resting on his breast.
      At last he spoke in confidence to Antipas, and revealed what he had wished
      to say.
    
    
      From the beginning of the month, he said, he had been studying the heavens
      every morning before daybreak, when the constellation of Perseus was at
      the zenith; Agalah was scarcely visible; Algol was even less bright;
      Mira-Cetus had disappeared entirely; from all of which he augured the
      death of some man of great importance, to occur that very night in
      Machaerus.
    
    
      Who was the man? Vitellius was too closely guarded to be reached. No one
      would kill Iaokanann.
    
    
      "It is I!" thought the tetrarch.
    
    
      It might be that the Arabs would return and make a successful attack upon
      him. Perhaps the proconsul would discover his relations with the
      Parthians. Several men whom Antipas had recognised as hired assassins from
      Jerusalem, had escorted the priests in the train of the proconsul; they
      all carried daggers concealed beneath their robes. The tetrarch had no
      doubt whatever of the exactness of Phanuel's skill in astrology.
    
    
      Suddenly he bethought him of Herodias. He would consult her. He hated her,
      certainly, but she might give him courage; and besides, in spite of his
      dislike, not all the bonds were yet broken of that sorcery which once she
      had woven about him.
    
    
      When he entered her chamber, he was met by the pungent odour of cinnamon
      burning in a porphyry vase and the perfume of powders, unguents,
      cloud-like gauzes and embroideries light as feathers, filled the air with
      fragrance.
    
    
      He did not speak of Phanuel's prophecy, nor of his own fear of the Jews
      and the Arabs. Herodias had already accused him of cowardice. He spoke
      only of the Romans, and complained that Vitellius had not confided to him
      any of his military projects. He said he supposed the proconsul was the
      friend of Caligula, who often visited Agrippa; and expressed a surmise
      that he himself might be exiled, or that perhaps his throat would be cut.
    
    
      Herodias, who now treated him with a kind of disdainful indulgence, tried
      to reassure him. At last she took from a small casket a curious medallion,
      ornamented with a profile of Tiberius. The sight of it, she said, as she
      gave it to Antipas, would make the lictors turn pale and silence all
      accusing voices.
    
    
      Antipas, filled with gratitude, asked her how the medallion had come into
      her possession.
    
    
      "It was given to me," was her only answer.
    
    
      At that moment Antipas beheld a bare arm slipping through a portiere
      hanging in front of him. It was the arm of a youthful woman, as graceful
      in outline as if carved from ivory by Polyclitus. With a movement a little
      awkward and at the same time charming, it felt about the wall an instant,
      as if seeking something, then took down a tunic hanging upon a hook near
      the doorway, and disappeared.
    
    
      An elderly female attendant passed quietly through the room, lifted the
      portiere, and went out. A sudden recollection pierced the memory of the
      tetrarch.
    
    
      "Is that woman one of thy slaves?" he asked.
    
    
      "What matters that to thee?" was the disdainful reply.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      CHAPTER III
    
    
      The great banqueting-hall was filled with guests. This apartment had three
      naves, like a basilica, which were separated by columns of sandalwood,
      whose capitals were of sculptured bonze. On each side of the apartment was
      a gallery for spectators, and a third, with a facade of gold filigree, was
      at one end, opposite an immense arch at the other.
    
    
      The candelabra burning on the tables, which were spread the whole length
      of the banqueting-hall, glowed like clusters of flaming flowers among the
      painted cups, the plates of shining copper, the cubes of snow and heaps of
      luscious grapes. Through the large windows the guests could see lighted
      torches on the terraces of the neighbouring houses; for this night Antipas
      was giving a feast to his friends, his own people, and to anyone that
      presented himself at the castle.
    
    
      The slaves, alert as dogs, glided about noiselessly in felt sandals,
      carrying dishes to and fro.
    
    
      The table of the proconsul was placed beneath the gilded balcony upon a
      platform of sycamore wood. Rich tapestries from Babylon were hung about
      the pavilion, giving a certain effect of seclusion.
    
    
      Upon three ivory couches, one facing the great hall, and the other two
      placed one on either side of the pavilion, reclined Vitellius, his son
      Aulus, and Antipas; the proconsul being near the door, at the left, Aulus
      on the right, the tetrarch occupying the middle couch.
    
    
      Antipas wore a heavy black mantle, the texture of which was almost hidden
      by coloured embroideries and glittering decorations; his beard was spread
      out like a fan; blue powder had been scattered over his hair, and on his
      head rested a diadem covered with precious stones. Vitellius still wore
      the purple band, the emblem of his rank, crossed diagonally over a linen
      toga.
    
    
      Aulus had tied behind his back the sleeves of his violet robe, embroidered
      with silver. His clustering curls were laid in carefully arranged rows; a
      necklace of sapphires gleamed against his throat, plump and white as that
      of a woman. Crouched upon a rug near him, with legs crossed was a pretty
      white boy, upon whose face shone a perpetual smile. Aulus had found him
      somewhere among the kitchens and had taken a violent fancy to him. He had
      made the child one of his suite, but as he never could remember his
      protege's Chaldean name, called him simply "the Asiatic." From time to
      time the little fellow sprang up and played about the dining-table, and
      his antics appeared to amuse the guests.
    
    
      At one side of the tetrarch's pavilion were the tables at which were
      seated his priests and officers; also a number of persons from Jerusalem,
      and the more important men from the Grecian cities. At the table on the
      left of the proconsul sat Marcellus with the publicans, several friends of
      the tetrarch, and various representatives from Cana, Ptolemais, and
      Jericho. Seated at other tables were mountaineers from Liban and many of
      the old soldiers of Herod's army; a dozen Thracians, a Greek and two
      Germans; besides huntsmen and herdsmen, the Sultan of Palmyra, and sailors
      from Eziongaber. Before each guest was placed a roll of soft bread, upon
      which to wipe the fingers. As soon as they were seated, hands were
      stretched out with the eagerness of a vulture's claws, seizing upon
      olives, pistachios, and almonds. Every face was joyous, every head was
      crowned with flowers, except those of the Pharisees, who refused to wear
      the wreaths, regarding them as a symbol of Roman voluptuousness and vice.
      They shuddered when the attendants sprinkled them with galburnum and
      incense, the use of which the Pharisees reserved strictly for services in
      the Temple.
    
    
      Antipas observed that Aulus rubbed himself under the arms, as if annoyed
      by heat or chafing; and promised to give him three flasks of the same kind
      of precious balm that had been used by Cleopatra.
    
    
      A captain from the garrison of Tiberias who had just arrived, placed
      himself behind the tetrarch as protection in case any unexpected trouble
      should arise. But his attention was divided between observing the
      movements of the proconsul and listening to the conversation of his
      neighbours.
    
    
      There was, naturally, much talk of Iaokanann, and other men of his stamp.
    
    
      "It is said," remarked one of the guests, "that Simon of Gitta washed away
      his sins in fire. And a certain man called Jesus&mdash;"
    
    
      "He is the worst of them all!" interrupted Eleazar. "A miserable
      imposter!"
    
    
      At this a man sprang up from a table near the tetrarch's pavilion, and
      made his way towards the place where Eleazar sat. His face was almost as
      pale as his linen robe, but he addressed the Pharisees boldly, saying:
      "That is a lie! Jesus has performed miracles!"
    
    
      Antipas expressed a long-cherished desire to see the man Jesus perform
      some of his so-called miracles. "You should have brought him with you," he
      said to the last speaker, who was still standing. "Tell us what you know
      about him," he commanded.
    
    
      Then the stranger said that he himself, whose name was Jacob, having a
      daughter who was very ill, had gone to Capernaum to implore the Master to
      heal his child. The Master had answered him, saying: "Return to thy home:
      she is healed!" And he had found his daughter standing at the threshold of
      his house, having risen from her couch when the gnomon had marked the
      third hour, the same moment when he had made his supplication to Jesus.
    
    
      The Pharisees admitted that certain mysterious arts and powerful herbs
      existed that would heal the sick. It was said that the marvellous plant
      known as "baaras" grew even in Machaerus, the power of which rendered its
      consumer invulnerable against all attacks; but to cure disease without
      seeing or touching the afflicted person was clearly impossible, unless,
      indeed, the man Jesus called in the assistance of evil spirits.
    
    
      The friends of Antipas and the men from Galilee nodded wisely, saying: "It
      is evident that he is aided by demons of some sort!"
    
    
      Jacob, standing between their table and that of the priests, maintained a
      silence at once lofty and respectful.
    
    
      Several voices exclaimed: "Prove his power to us!"
    
    
      Jacob leaned over the priests' table, and said slowly, in a
      half-suppressed tone, as if awe-struck by his own words:
    
    
      "Know ye not, then, that He is the Messiah?"
    
    
      The priests stared at one another, and Vitellius demanded the meaning of
      the word. His interpreter paused a moment before translating it. Then he
      said that Messiah was the name to be given to one who was to come,
      bringing the enjoyment of all blessings, and giving them domination over
      all the peoples of the earth. Certain persons believed that there were to
      be two Messiahs; one would be vanquished by Gog and Magog, the demons of
      the North; but the other would exterminate the Prince of Evil; and for
      centuries the coming of this Saviour of mankind had been expected at any
      moment.
    
    
      At this, the priests began to talk in low tones among themselves. Eleazar
      addressed Jacob, saying that it had always been understood that the
      Messiah would be a son of David, not of a carpenter; and that he would
      confirm the law, whereas this Nazarene attacked it. Furthermore, as a
      still stronger argument against the pretender, it had been promised that
      the Messiah should be preceded by Elias.
    
    
      "But Elias has come!" Jacob answered.
    
    
      "Elias! Elias!" was repeated from one end of the banqueting-hall to the
      other.
    
    
      In imagination, all fancied that they could see an old man, a flight of
      ravens above his head, standing before an altar, which a flash of
      lightning illumined, revealing the idolatrous priests that were thrown
      into the torrent; and the women, sitting in the galleries, thought of the
      widow of Sarepta.
    
    
      Jacob then declared that he knew Elias; that he had seen him, and that
      many of the guests there assembled had seen him!
    
    
      "His name!" was the cry from all lips.
    
    
      "Iaokanann!"
    
    
      Antipas fell back in his chair as if a heavy blow had struck him on the
      breast. The Sadducees rose from their seats and rushed towards Jacob.
      Eleazar raised his voice to a shout in order to make himself heard. When
      order was finally restored, he draped his mantle about his shoulders, and,
      with the air of a judge, proceeded to put questions to Jacob.
    
    
      "Since the prophet is dead&mdash;" he began.
    
    
      Murmurs interrupted him. Many persons believed that Elias was not dead,
      but had only disappeared.
    
    
      Eleazar rebuked those who had interrupted him; and continuing, asked:
    
    
      "And dost thou believe that he has indeed come to life again?"
    
    
      "Why should I not believe it?" Jacob replied.
    
    
      The Sadducees shrugged their shoulders. Jonathas, opening wide his little
      eyes, gave a forced, buffoon-like laugh. Nothing could be more absurd,
      said he, than the idea that a human body could have eternal life; and he
      declaimed, for the benefit of the proconsul, this line from a
      contemporaneous poet:
    
    
      Nec crescit, nec post mortem durare videtur.
    
    
      By this time Aulus was leaning over the side of the pavilion, with pale
      face, a perspiring brow, and both hands outspread on his stomach.
    
    
      The Sadducees pretended to be deeply moved at the sight of his suffering,
      thinking that perhaps the next day the offices of sacrificers would be
      theirs. Antipas appeared to be in despair at his guest's agony. Vitellius
      preserved a calm demeanour, although he felt some anxiety, for the loss of
      his son would mean the loss of his fortune.
    
    
      But Aulus, quickly recovering after he had relieved his over-burdened
      stomach, was as eager to eat as before.
    
    
      "Let some one bring me marble-dust," he commanded, "or clay of Naxos,
      sea-water&mdash;anything! Perhaps it would do me good to bathe."
    
    
      He swallowed a quantity of snow; then hesitated between a ragout and a
      dish of blackbirds; and finally decided in favour of gourds served in
      honey. The little Asiatic gazed at his master in astonishment and
      admiration; to him this exhibition of gluttony denoted a wonderful being
      belonging to a superior race.
    
    
      The feast went on. Slaves served the guests with kidneys, dormice,
      nightingales, mince-meat dressed with vine-leaves. The priests discoursed
      among themselves regarding the supposed resurrection. Ammonius, pupil of
      Philon, the Platonist, pronounced them stupid, and told the Greeks that he
      laughed at their oracles.
    
    
      Marcellus and Jacob were seated side by side. Marcellus described the
      happiness he had felt under the baptism of Mithra, and Jacob made him
      promise to become a follower of Jesus.
    
    
      The wines of the palm and the tamarisk, those of Safed and of Byblos, ran
      from the amphoras into the crateras, from the crateras into the cups, and
      from the cups down the guests' throats. Every one talked, all hearts
      expanding under the good cheer. Jacim, although a Jew, did not hesitate to
      express his admiration of the planets. A merchant from Aphaka amazed the
      nomads with his description of the marvels in the temple of Hierapolis;
      and they wished to know the cost of a pilgrimage to that place. Others
      held fast to the principles of their native religion. A German, who was
      nearly blind, sang a hymn celebrating that promontory in Scandinavia where
      the gods were wont to appear with halos around their heads. The people
      from Sichem declined to eat turtles, out of deference to the dove Azima.
    
    
      Several groups stood talking near the middle of the banqueting-hall, and
      the vapour of their breath, mingled with the smoke from the candles,
      formed a light mist. Presently Phanuel slipped quietly into the room,
      keeping close to the wall. He had been out in the open courtyard, to make
      another survey of the heavens. He stopped when he reached the pavilion of
      the tetrarch, fearing he would be splashed with drops of oil if he
      approached the other tables, which, to an Essene, would be a great
      defilement.
    
    
      Suddenly violent blows resounded upon the castle gates. The news of the
      imprisonment of Iaokanann had spread rapidly, and now it appeared that the
      whole surrounding population was flocking to the castle. Men with torches
      were hastening along the roads in all directions; a black mass of people
      swarmed in the ravine; and from all throats came the cry: "Iaokanann!
      Iaokanann!"
    
    
      "That man will ruin everything," said Jonathas.
    
    
      "We shall have no more money if this continues," said the Pharisees.
    
    
      Accusations, recriminations, and pleadings were heard on all sides.
    
    
      "Protect us!"
    
    
      "Compel them to cease!"
    
    
      "Thou didst abandon thy religion!"
    
    
      "Impious as all the Herods!"
    
    
      "Less impious than thou!" Antipas retorted. "Was it not my father that
      erected thy Temple?"
    
    
      Then the Pharisees, children of the proscribed tribes, partisans of
      Mattathias, accused the tetrarch of all the crimes committed by his
      family.
    
    
      The Pharisees had pointed skulls, bristling beards, feeble hands, snub
      noses, great round eyes, and their countenances bore a resemblance to that
      of a bull-dog. A dozen of these people, scribes and attendants upon the
      priests, who picked up their living from the refuse of holocausts, rushed
      to the foot of the pavilion and threatened Antipas with their knives. He
      attempted to speak to them, being only slightly protected by some of the
      Sadducees. Suddenly he perceived Mannaeus at a distance and made him a
      sign to approach. The expression on the face of Vitellius indicated that
      he regarded all this turmoil as no concern of his.
    
    
      The Pharisees, leaning against the pavilion, were now beside themselves
      with demoniac fury. They broke plates and dashed them upon the floor. The
      attendants had served them with a ragout composed of the flesh of the wild
      ass, an unclean animal, and their anger knew no bounds. Aulus rallied them
      jeeringly apropos of the ass's head, which he declared they honoured. He
      flung other sarcasms at them, regarding their antipathy to the flesh of
      swine, intimating that no doubt their hatred arose from the fact that that
      beast had killed their beloved Bacchus, and saying it was to be feared
      they were too fond of wine, since a golden vine had been discovered in the
      Temple.
    
    
      The priests did not understand his sneers, and Phineas, of Galilean
      origin, refused to translate them. Aulus suddenly became angry, the more
      so because the little Asiatic, frightened at the tumult, had disappeared.
      The feast no longer pleased the noble glutton; the dishes were vulgar, and
      not sufficiently disguised with delicate flavourings. After a time his
      displeasure abated, as he caught sight of a dish of Syrian lambs' tails,
      dressed with spices, a favourite dainty.
    
    
      To Vitellius the character of the Jews seemed frightful. Their God was
      like Moloch, several altars to whom he had passed upon his route; and he
      recalled the stories he had heard of the mysterious Jew who fattened small
      children and offered them as a sacrifice. His Latin nature was filled with
      disgust at their intolerance, their iconoclastic rage, their brutal,
      stumbling bearing. The proconsul wished to depart, but Aulus refused to
      accompany him.
    
    
      The exaltation of the people increased. They abandoned themselves to
      dreams of independence. They recalled the glory of Israel, and a Syrian
      spoke of all the great conquerors they had vanquished,&mdash;Antigone,
      Crassus, Varus.
    
    
      "Miserable creatures!" cried the enraged proconsul, who had overheard the
      Syrian's words.
    
    
      In the midst of the uproar Antipas remembered the medallion of the emperor
      that Herodias had given to him; he drew it forth and looked at it a
      moment, trembling, then held it up with its face turned towards the
      throng.
    
    
      At the same moment, the panels of the gold-railed balcony were folded
      back, and, accompanied by slaves bearing wax tapers, Herodias appeared,
      her coiffure crowned with an Assyrian mitre, which was held in place by a
      band passing under the chin. Her dark hair fell in ringlets over a scarlet
      peplum with slashed sleeves. On either side of the door through which one
      stepped into the gallery, stood a huge stone monster, like those of
      Atrides; and as Herodias appeared between them, she looked like Cybele
      supported by her lions. In her hands she carried a patera, a shallow
      vessel of silver used by the Romans in pouring libations; and, advancing
      to the front of the balcony and pausing just above the tetrarch's chair,
      she cried:
    
    
      "Long live Caesar!"
    
    
      This homage was repeated by Vitellius, Antipas, and the priests.
    
    
      But now, beginning at the farthest end of the banqueting-hall, a murmur of
      surprise and admiration swept through the multitude. A beautiful young
      girl had just entered the apartment, and stood motionless for an instant,
      while all eyes were turned upon her.
    
    
      Through a drapery of filmy blue gauze that veiled her head and throat, her
      arched eyebrows, tiny ears, and ivory-white skin could be distinguished. A
      scarf of shot-silk fell from her shoulders, and was caught up at the waist
      by a girdle of fretted silver. Her full trousers, of black silk, were
      embroidered in a pattern of silver mandragoras, and as she moved forward
      with indolent grace, her little feet were seen to be shod with slippers
      made of the feathers of humming-birds.
    
    
      When she arrived in front of the pavilion she removed her veil. Behold!
      she seemed to be Herodias herself, as she had appeared in the days of her
      blooming youth.
    
    
      Immediately the damsel began to dance before the tetrarch. Her slender
      feet took dainty steps to the rhythm of a flute and a pair of Indian
      bells. Her round white arms seemed ever beckoning and striving to entice
      to her side some youth who was fleeing from her allurements. She appeared
      to pursue him, with movements light as a butterfly; her whole mien was
      like that of an inquisitive Psyche, or a floating spirit that might at any
      moment dissolve and disappear.
    
    
      Presently the plaintive notes of the gingras, a small flute of Phoenician
      origin, replaced the tinkling bells. The attitudes of the dancing nymph
      now denoted overpowering lassitude. Her bosom heaved with sighs, and her
      whole being expressed profound languor, although it was not clear whether
      she sighed for an absent swain or was expiring of love in his embrace.
      With half-closed eyes and quivering form, she caused mysterious
      undulations to flow downward over her whole body, like rippling waves,
      while her face remained impassive and her twinkling feet still moved in
      their intricate steps.
    
    
      Vitellius compared her to Mnester, the famous pantomimist. Aulus was
      overcome with faintness. The tetrarch watched her, lost in a voluptuous
      reverie, and thought no more of the real Herodias. In fancy he saw her
      again as she appeared when she had dwelt among the Sadducees. Then the
      vision faded.
    
    
      But this beautiful thing before him was no vision. The dancer was Salome,
      the daughter of Herodias, who for many months her mother had caused to be
      instructed in dancing, and other arts of pleasing, with the sole idea of
      bringing her to Machaerus and presenting her to the tetrarch, so that he
      should fall in love with her fresh young beauty and feminine wiles. The
      plan had proved successful, it seemed; he was evidently fascinated, and
      Herodias felt that at last she was sure of retaining her power over him!
    
    
      And now the graceful dancer appeared transported with the very delirium of
      love and passion. She danced like the priestesses of India, like the
      Nubians of the cataracts, or like the Bacchantes of Lydia. She whirled
      about like a flower blown by the tempest. The jewels in her ears sparkled,
      her swift movements made the colours of her draperies appear to run into
      one another. Her arms, her feet, her clothing even, seemed to emit streams
      of magnetism, that set the spectators' blood on fire.
    
    
      Suddenly the thrilling chords of a harp rang through the hall, and the
      throng burst into loud acclamations. All eyes were fixed on Salome, who
      paused in her rhythmic dance, placed her feet wide apart, and without
      bending the knees, suddenly swayed her lithe body downward, so that her
      chin touched the floor; and her whole audience,&mdash;the nomads,
      accustomed to a life of privation and abstinence, the Roman soldiers,
      expert in debaucheries, the avaricious publicans, and even the crabbed,
      elderly priests&mdash;gazed upon her with dilated nostrils.
    
    
      Next she began to whirl frantically around the table where Antipas the
      tetrarch was seated. He leaned towards the flying figure, and in a voice
      half choked with the voluptuous sighs of a mad desire, he sighed: "Come to
      me! Come!" But she whirled on, while the music of dulcimers swelled louder
      and the excited spectators roared their applause.
    
    
      The tetrarch called again, louder than before: "Come to me! Come! Thou
      shalt have Capernaum, the plains of Tiberias! my citadels! yea, the half
      of my kingdom!"
    
    
      Again the dancer paused; then, like a flash, she threw herself upon the
      palms of her hands, while her feet rose straight up into the air. In this
      bizarre pose she moved about upon the floor like a gigantic beetle; then
      stood motionless.
    
    
      The nape of her neck formed a right angle with her vertebrae. The full
      silken skirts of pale hues that enveloped her limbs when she stood erect,
      now fell to her shoulders and surrounded her face like a rainbow. Her lips
      were tinted a deep crimson, her arched eyebrows were black as jet, her
      glowing eyes had an almost terrible radiance; and the tiny drops of
      perspiration on her forehead looked like dew upon white marble.
    
    
      She made no sound; and the burning gaze of that multitude of men was
      concentrated upon her.
    
    
      A sound like the snapping of fingers came from the gallery over the
      pavilion. Instantly, with one of her movements of bird-like swiftness,
      Salome stood erect. The next moment she rapidly passed up a flight of
      steps leading to the gallery, and coming to the front of it she leaned
      over, smiled upon the tetrarch, and, with an air of almost childlike
      naivete, pronounced these words:
    
    
      "I ask my lord to give me, placed upon a charger, the head of&mdash;" She
      hesitated, as if not certain of the name; then said: "The head of
      Iaokanann!"
    
    
      The tetrarch sank back in his chair as if stunned.
    
    
      He had bound himself by his promise to her; and the people awaited his
      next movement. But the death that night of some conspicuous man that had
      been predicted to him by Phanuel,&mdash;what if, by bringing it upon
      another, he could avert it from himself, thought Antipas. If Iaokanann was
      in very truth the Elias so much talked of, he would have power to protect
      himself; and if he were only an ordinary man, his murder was of no
      importance.
    
    
      Mannaeus stood beside his chair, and read his master's thoughts. Vitellius
      beckoned him to his side and gave him an order for the execution, to be
      transmitted to the soldiers placed on guard over the dungeon. This
      execution would be a relief, he thought. In a few moments all would be
      over!
    
    
      But for once Mannaeus did not perform a commission satisfactorily. He left
      the hall but soon returned, in a state of great perturbation.
    
    
      During forty years he had exercised the functions of the public
      executioner. It was he that had drowned Aristobulus, strangled Alexander,
      burned Mattathias alive, beheaded Zozimus, Pappus, Josephus, and
      Antipater; but he dared not kill Iaokanann! His teeth chattered and his
      whole body trembled.
    
    
      He declared that he had seen, standing before the dungeon, the Angel of
      the Samaritans, covered with eyes and brandishing a great sword, glowing
      and quivering like a flame. He appealed to two of the guards, who had
      entered the hall with him, to corroborate his words. But they said they
      had seen nothing except a Jewish captain who had attacked them, and whom
      they had killed.
    
    
      The fury of Herodias poured forth in a torrent of invective against the
      populace. She clenched the railing of the balcony so fiercely as to break
      her nails; the two stone lions at her back seemed to bite her shoulders
      and join their voices to hers.
    
    
      Antipas followed her example; and priests, soldiers, and Pharisees cried
      aloud together for vengeance, echoed by the rest of the gathering, who
      were indignant that a mere slave should dare to delay their pleasures.
    
    
      Again Mannaeus left the hall, covering his face with his hands.
    
    
      The guests found the second delay longer than the first. It seemed tedious
      to every one.
    
    
      Presently a sound of footsteps was heard in the corridor without; then
      silence fell again. The suspense was becoming intolerable.
    
    
      Suddenly the door was flung open and Mannaeus entered, holding at arm's
      length, grasping it by the hair, the head of Iaokanann. His appearance was
      greeted with a burst of applause, which filled him with pride and revived
      his courage.
    
    
      He placed the head upon a charger and offered it to Salome, who had
      descended the steps to receive it. She remounted to the balcony, with a
      light step; and in another moment the charger was carried about from one
      table to another by the elderly female slave whom the tetrarch had
      observed in the morning on the balcony of a neighbouring house, and later
      in the chamber of Herodias.
    
    
      When she approached him with her ghastly burden, he turned away his head
      to avoid looking at it. Vitellius threw upon it an indifferent glance.
    
    
      Mannaeus descended from the pavilion, took the charger from the woman, and
      exhibited the head to the Roman captains, then to all the guests on that
      side of the hall.
    
    
      They looked at it curiously.
    
    
      The sharp blade of the sword had cut into the jaw with a swift downward
      stroke. The corners of the mouth were drawn, as if by a convulsion. Clots
      of blood besprinkled the beard. The closed eyelids had a shell-like
      transparency, and the candelabra on every side lighted up the gruesome
      object with terrible distinctness.
    
    
      Mannaeus arrived at the table where the priests were seated. One of them
      turned the charger about curiously, to look at the head from all sides.
      Then Mannaeus, having entirely regained his courage, placed the charger
      before Aulus, who had just awakened from a short doze; and finally he
      brought it again to Antipas and set it down upon the table beside him.
      Tears were running down the cheeks of the tetrarch.
    
    
      The lights began to flicker and die out. The guests departed, and at last
      no one remained in the great hall save Antipas, who sat leaning his head
      upon his hands, gazing at the head of Iaokanann; and Phanuel, who stood in
      the centre of the largest nave and prayed aloud, with uplifted arms.
    
    
      At sunrise the two men who had been sent on a mission by Iaokanann some
      time before, returned to the castle, bringing the answer so long awaited
      and hoped for.
    
    
      They whispered the message to Phanuel, who received it with rapture.
    
    
      Then he showed them the lugubrious object, still resting on the charger
      amid the ruins of the feast. One of the men said:
    
    
      "Be comforted! He has descended among the dead in order to announce the
      coming of the Christ!"
    
    
      And in that moment the Essene comprehended the words of Iaokanann: "In
      order that His glory may increase, mine must diminish!"
    
    
      Then the three, taking with them the head of John the Baptist, set out
      upon the road to Galilee; and as the burden was heavy, each man bore it
      awhile in turn.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
