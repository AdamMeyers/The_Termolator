[495]
THE FALL OF ROBESPIERRE[495:1]

AN HISTORIC DRAMA

[First Act by Coleridge: Second and Third by Southey&mdash;1794.]


&nbsp;

TO

H. MARTIN, ESQ.

OF

JESUS COLLEGE

CAMBRIDGE


Dear Sir,

Accept, as a small testimony of my grateful attachment, the following
Dramatic Poem, in which I have endeavoured to detail, in an interesting
form, the fall of a man, whose great bad actions have cast a disastrous
lustre on his name. In the execution of the work, as intricacy of plot
could not have been attempted without a gross violation of recent facts,
it has been my sole aim to imitate the empassioned and highly figurative
language of the French orators, and to develope the characters of the
chief actors on a vast stage of horrors.

Yours fraternally,

S. T. Coleridge.

Jesus College, September 22, 1794.



FOOTNOTES:

[495:1] First published (as an octavo pamphlet) at Cambridge by
Benjamin Flower in 1794: included in Literary Remains, 1836, i.
(1)-32. First collected in P. and D. W., 1877-80, in. (1)-39. 'It will
be remarked,' writes J. D. Campbell (P. W., 1893, p. 646), 'that
neither title-page nor dedication contains any hint of the joint
authorship.' On this point Coleridge writes to Southey, September 19,
1794:&mdash;'The tragedy will be printed in less than a week. I shall put my
name because it will sell at least a hundred copies in Cambridge. It
would appear ridiculous to print two names to such a work. But if you
choose it, mention it and it shall be done. To every man who praises
it, of course I give the true biography of it.' Letters of S. T. C.,
1895, i. 85.



[496]
ACT I

Scene&mdash;The Thuilleries.


Barrere. The tempest gathers&mdash;be it mine to seek
A friendly shelter, ere it bursts upon him.
But where? and how? I fear the Tyrant's soul&mdash;
Sudden in action, fertile in resource,
And rising awful 'mid impending ruins; 5
In splendor gloomy, as the midnight meteor,
That fearless thwarts the elemental war.
When last in secret conference we met,
He scowl'd upon me with suspicious rage,
Making his eye the inmate of my bosom. 10
I know he scorns me&mdash;and I feel, I hate him&mdash;
Yet there is in him that which makes me tremble! [Exit.


Enter Tallien and Legendre.


Tallien. It was Barrere, Legendre! didst thou mark him?
Abrupt he turn'd, yet linger'd as he went,
And towards us cast a look of doubtful meaning. 15

Legendre. I mark'd him well. I met his eye's last glance;
It menac'd not so proudly as of yore.
Methought he would have spoke&mdash;but that he dar'd not&mdash;
Such agitation darken'd on his brow.

Tallien. 'Twas all-distrusting guilt that kept from bursting 20
Th' imprison'd secret struggling in the face:
E'en as the sudden breeze upstarting onwards
Hurries the thundercloud, that pois'd awhile
Hung in mid air, red with its mutinous burthen.

Legendre. Perfidious Traitor!&mdash;still afraid to bask 25
In the full blaze of power, the rustling serpent
Lurks in the thicket of the Tyrant's greatness,
Ever prepared to sting who shelters him.
Each thought, each action in himself converges;
And love and friendship on his coward heart 30
Shine like the powerless sun on polar ice;
To all attach'd, by turns deserting all,
Cunning and dark&mdash;a necessary villain!

Tallien. Yet much depends upon him&mdash;well you know
With plausible harangue 'tis his to paint 35
Defeat like victory&mdash;and blind the mob
With truth-mix'd falsehood. They led on by him,
[497]
And wild of head to work their own destruction,
Support with uproar what he plans in darkness.

Legendre. O what a precious name is Liberty 40
To scare or cheat the simple into slaves!
Yes&mdash;we must gain him over: by dark hints
We'll shew enough to rouse his watchful fears,
Till the cold coward blaze a patriot.
O Danton! murder'd friend! assist my counsels&mdash; 45
Hover around me on sad Memory's wings,
And pour thy daring vengeance in my heart.
Tallien! if but to-morrow's fateful sun
Beholds the Tyrant living&mdash;we are dead!

Tallien. Yet his keen eye that flashes mighty meanings&mdash; 50

Legendre. Fear not&mdash;or rather fear th' alternative,
And seek for courage e'en in cowardice&mdash;
But see&mdash;hither he comes&mdash;let us away!
His brother with him, and the bloody Couthon,
And high of haughty spirit, young St. Just. 55[Exeunt.


Enter Robespierre, Couthon, St. Just, and Robespierre Junior.


Robespierre. What? did La Fayette fall before my power?
And did I conquer Roland's spotless virtues?
The fervent eloquence of Vergniaud's tongue?
And Brissot's thoughtful soul unbribed and bold?
Did zealot armies haste in vain to save them? 60
What! did th' assassin's dagger aim its point
Vain, as a dream of murder, at my bosom?
And shall I dread the soft luxurious Tallien?
Th' Adonis Tallien? banquet-hunting Tallien?
Him, whose heart flutters at the dice-box? Him, 65
Who ever on the harlots' downy pillow
Resigns his head impure to feverish slumbers!

St. Just. I cannot fear him&mdash;yet we must not scorn him.
Was it not Antony that conquer'd Brutus,
Th' Adonis, banquet-hunting Antony? 70
The state is not yet purified: and though
The stream runs clear, yet at the bottom lies
The thick black sediment of all the factions&mdash;
It needs no magic hand to stir it up!

Couthon. O we did wrong to spare them&mdash;fatal error! 75
Why lived Legendre, when that Danton died?
And Collot d'Herbois dangerous in crimes?
[498]
I've fear'd him, since his iron heart endured
To make of Lyons one vast human shambles,
Compar'd with which the sun-scorcht wilderness 80
Of Zara were a smiling paradise.

St. Just. Rightly thou judgest, Couthon! He is one
Who flies from silent solitary anguish,
Seeking forgetful peace amid the jar
Of elements. The howl of maniac uproar 85
Lulls to sad sleep the memory of himself.
A calm is fatal to him&mdash;then he feels
The dire upboilings of the storm within him.
A tiger mad with inward wounds!&mdash;I dread
The fierce and restless turbulence of guilt. 90

Robespierre. Is not the Commune ours? The stern tribunal?
Dumas? and Vivier? Fleuriot? and Louvet?
And Henriot? We'll denounce an hundred, nor
Shall they behold to-morrow's sun roll westward.

Robespierre Junior. Nay&mdash;I am sick of blood; my aching heart 95
Reviews the long, long train of hideous horrors
That still have gloom'd the rise of the Republic.
I should have died before Toulon, when war
Became the patriot!

Robespierre. Most unworthy wish!
He, whose heart sickens at the blood of traitors, 100
Would be himself a traitor, were he not
A coward! 'Tis congenial souls alone
Shed tears of sorrow for each other's fate.
O thou art brave, my brother! and thine eye
Full firmly shines amid the groaning battle&mdash; 105
Yet in thine heart the woman-form of pity
Asserts too large a share, an ill-timed guest!
There is unsoundness in the state&mdash;To-morrow
Shall see it cleans'd by wholesome massacre!

Robespierre Junior. Beware! already do the sections murmur&mdash; 110
'O the great glorious patriot, Robespierre&mdash;
The tyrant guardian of the country's freedom!'

Couthon. 'Twere folly sure to work great deeds by halves!
Much I suspect the darksome fickle heart
Of cold Barrere!

Robespierre. I see the villain in him! 115

Robespierre Junior. If he&mdash;if all forsake thee&mdash;what remains?

[499]

Robespierre. Myself! the steel-strong Rectitude of soul
And Poverty sublime 'mid circling virtues!
The giant Victories my counsels form'd
Shall stalk around me with sun-glittering plumes, 120
Bidding the darts of calumny fall pointless. [Exeunt caeteri. Manet Couthon.

Couthon (solus). So we deceive ourselves! What goodly virtues
Bloom on the poisonous branches of ambition!
Still, Robespierre! thou'lt guard thy country's freedom
To despotize in all the patriot's pomp. 125
While Conscience, 'mid the mob's applauding clamours,
Sleeps in thine ear, nor whispers&mdash;blood-stain'd tyrant!
Yet what is Conscience? Superstition's dream,
Making such deep impression on our sleep&mdash;
That long th' awakened breast retains its horrors! 130
But he returns&mdash;and with him comes Barrere.
[Exit Couthon.


Enter Robespierre and Barrere.


Robespierre. There is no danger but in cowardice.&mdash;
Barrere! we make the danger, when we fear it.
We have such force without, as will suspend
The cold and trembling treachery of these members. 135

Barrere. 'Twill be a pause of terror.&mdash;

Robespierre. But to whom?
Rather the short-lived slumber of the tempest,
Gathering its strength anew. The dastard traitors!
Moles, that would undermine the rooted oak!
A pause!&mdash;a moment's pause?&mdash;'Tis all their life. 140

Barrere. Yet much they talk&mdash;and plausible their speech.
Couthon's decree has given such powers, that&mdash;

Robespierre. That what?

Barrere. The freedom of debate&mdash;

Robespierre. Transparent mask!
They wish to clog the wheels of government,
Forcing the hand that guides the vast machine 145
To bribe them to their duty&mdash;English patriots!
Are not the congregated clouds of war
Black all around us? In our very vitals
Works not the king-bred poison of rebellion?
Say, what shall counteract the selfish plottings 150
Of wretches, cold of heart, nor awed by fears
Of him, whose power directs th' eternal justice?
[500]
Terror? or secret-sapping gold? The first
Heavy, but transient as the ills that cause it;
And to the virtuous patriot rendered light 155
By the necessities that gave it birth:
The other fouls the fount of the republic,
Making it flow polluted to all ages:
Inoculates the state with a slow venom,
That once imbibed, must be continued ever. 160
Myself incorruptible I ne'er could bribe them&mdash;
Therefore they hate me.

Barrere. Are the sections friendly?

Robespierre. There are who wish my ruin&mdash;but I'll make them
Blush for the crime in blood!

Barrere. Nay&mdash;but I tell thee,
Thou art too fond of slaughter&mdash;and the right 165
(If right it be) workest by most foul means!

Robespierre. Self-centering Fear! how well thou canst ape Mercy!
Too fond of slaughter!&mdash;matchless hypocrite!
Thought Barrere so, when Brissot, Danton died?
Thought Barrere so, when through the streaming streets 170
Of Paris red-eyed Massacre o'erwearied
Reel'd heavily, intoxicate with blood?
And when (O heavens!) in Lyons' death-red square
Sick Fancy groan'd o'er putrid hills of slain,
Didst thou not fiercely laugh, and bless the day? 175
Why, thou hast been the mouth-piece of all horrors,
And, like a blood-hound, crouch'd for murder! Now
Aloof thou standest from the tottering pillar,
Or, like a frighted child behind its mother,
Hidest thy pale face in the skirts of&mdash;Mercy! 180

Barrere. O prodigality of eloquent anger!
Why now I see thou'rt weak&mdash;thy case is desperate!
The cool ferocious Robespierre turn'd scolder!

Robespierre. Who from a bad man's bosom wards the blow
Reserves the whetted dagger for his own. 185
Denounced twice&mdash;and twice I saved his life! [Exit.

Barrere. The sections will support them&mdash;there's the point!
No! he can never weather out the storm&mdash;
Yet he is sudden in revenge&mdash;No more!
I must away to Tallien. [Exit. 190



[501]
Scene changes to the house of Adelaide.

Adelaide enters, speaking to a Servant.


Adelaide. Didst thou present the letter that I gave thee?
Did Tallien answer, he would soon return?

Servant. He is in the Thuilleries&mdash;with him Legendre&mdash;
In deep discourse they seem'd: as I approach'd
He waved his hand as bidding me retire: 195
I did not interrupt him. [Returns the letter.

Adelaide. Thou didst rightly. [Exit Servant.
O this new freedom! at how dear a price
We've bought the seeming good! The peaceful virtues
And every blandishment of private life,
The father's cares, the mother's fond endearment, 200
All sacrificed to liberty's wild riot.
The wing&eacute;d hours, that scatter'd roses round me,
Languid and sad drag their slow course along,
And shake big gall-drops from their heavy wings.
But I will steal away these anxious thoughts 205
By the soft languishment of warbled airs,
If haply melodies may lull the sense
Of sorrow for a while. [Soft music.


Enter Tallien.


Tallien. Music, my love? O breathe again that air!
Soft nurse of pain, it sooths the weary soul 210
Of care, sweet as the whisper'd breeze of evening
That plays around the sick man's throbbing temples.

SONG[501:1]

Tell me, on what holy ground
May domestic peace be found?
Halcyon daughter of the skies, 215
Far on fearful wing she flies,
From the pomp of scepter'd state,
From the rebel's noisy hate.

In a cottag'd vale she dwells
List'ning to the Sabbath bells! 220
[502]
Still around her steps are seen,
Spotless honor's meeker mien,
Love, the sire of pleasing fears,
Sorrow smiling through her tears,
And conscious of the past employ, 225
Memory, bosom-spring of joy.

Tallien. I thank thee, Adelaide! 'twas sweet, though mournful.
But why thy brow o'ercast, thy cheek so wan?
Thou look'st as a lorn maid beside some stream
That sighs away the soul in fond despairing, 230
While sorrow sad, like the dank willow near her,
Hangs o'er the troubled fountain of her eye.

Adelaide. Ah! rather let me ask what mystery lowers
On Tallien's darken'd brow. Thou dost me wrong&mdash;
Thy soul distemper'd, can my heart be tranquil? 235

Tallien. Tell me, by whom thy brother's blood was spilt?
Asks he not vengeance on these patriot murderers?
It has been borne too tamely. Fears and curses
Groan on our midnight beds, and e'en our dreams
Threaten the assassin hand of Robespierre. 240
He dies!&mdash;nor has the plot escaped his fears.

Adelaide. Yet&mdash;yet&mdash;be cautious! much I fear the Commune&mdash;
The tyrant's creatures, and their fate with his
Fast link'd in close indissoluble union.
The pale Convention&mdash;

Tallien. Hate him as they fear him, 245
Impatient of the chain, resolv'd and ready.

Adelaide. Th' enthusiast mob, confusion's lawless sons&mdash;

Tallien. They are aweary of his stern morality,
The fair-mask'd offspring of ferocious pride.
The sections too support the delegates: 250
All&mdash;all is ours! e'en now the vital air
Of Liberty, condens'd awhile, is bursting
(Force irresistible!) from its compressure&mdash;
To shatter the arch chemist in the explosion!


Enter Billaud Varennes and Bourdon l'Oise.

[Adelaide retires.


Bourdon l'Oise. Tallien! was this a time for amorous conference? 255
Henriot, the tyrant's most devoted creature,
[503]Marshals the force of Paris: The fierce Club,
With Vivier at their head, in loud acclaim
Have sworn to make the guillotine in blood
Float on the scaffold.&mdash;But who comes here? 260


Enter Barrere abruptly.


Barrere. Say, are ye friends to freedom? I am her's!
Let us, forgetful of all common feuds,
Rally around her shrine! E'en now the tyrant
Concerts a plan of instant massacre!

Billaud Varennes. Away to the Convention! with that voice 265
So oft the herald of glad victory,
Rouse their fallen spirits, thunder in their ears
The names of tyrant, plunderer, assassin!
The violent workings of my soul within
Anticipate the monster's blood! 270


[Cry from the street of&mdash;No Tyrant! Down with the Tyrant!


Tallien. Hear ye that outcry?&mdash;If the trembling members
Even for a moment hold his fate suspended,
I swear by the holy poniard, that stabbed Caesar,
This dagger probes his heart! [Exeunt omnes.

ACT II

Scene&mdash;The Convention.


Robespierre mounts the Tribune. Once more befits it that the voice of Truth,
Fearless in innocence, though leaguered round
By Envy and her hateful brood of hell,
Be heard amid this hall; once more befits
The patriot, whose prophetic eye so oft 5
Has pierced thro' faction's veil, to flash on crimes
Of deadliest import. Mouldering in the grave
Sleeps Capet's caitiff corse; my daring hand
Levelled to earth his blood-cemented throne,
My voice declared his guilt, and stirred up France 10
To call for vengeance. I too dug the grave
Where sleep the Girondists, detested band!
Long with the shew of freedom they abused
Her ardent sons. Long time the well-turn'd phrase,
The high-fraught sentence and the lofty tone 15
[504]Of declamation, thunder'd in this hall,
Till reason midst a labyrinth of words
Perplex'd, in silence seem'd to yield assent.
I durst oppose. Soul of my honoured friend,
Spirit of Marat, upon thee I call&mdash; 20
Thou know'st me faithful, know'st with what warm zeal
I urg'd the cause of justice, stripp'd the mask
From faction's deadly visage, and destroy'd
Her traitor brood. Whose patriot arm hurl'd down
H&eacute;bert and Rousin, and the villain friends 25
Of Danton, foul apostate! those, who long
Mask'd treason's form in liberty's fair garb,
Long deluged France with blood, and durst defy
Omnipotence! but I it seems am false!
I am a traitor too! I&mdash;Robespierre! 30
I&mdash;at whose name the dastard despot brood
Look pale with fear, and call on saints to help them!
Who dares accuse me? who shall dare belie
My spotless name? Speak, ye accomplice band,
Of what am I accus'd? of what strange crime 35
Is Maximilian Robespierre accus'd,
That through this hall the buz of discontent
Should murmur? who shall speak?

Billaud Varennes. O patriot tongue
Belying the foul heart! Who was it urg'd
Friendly to tyrants that accurst decree, 40
Whose influence brooding o'er this hallowed hall,
Has chill'd each tongue to silence? Who destroyed
The freedom of debate, and carried through
The fatal law, that doom'd the delegates,
Unheard before their equals, to the bar 45
Where cruelty sat throned, and murder reign'd
With her Dumas coequal? Say&mdash;thou man
Of mighty eloquence, whose law was that?

Couthon. That law was mine. I urged it&mdash;I propos'd&mdash;
The voice of France assembled in her sons 50
Assented, though the tame and timid voice
Of traitors murmur'd. I advis'd that law&mdash;
I justify it. It was wise and good.

Barrere. Oh, wonderous wise and most convenient too!
I have long mark'd thee, Robespierre&mdash;and now 55
Proclaim thee traitor tyrant! [Loud applauses.

Robespierre. It is well.
[505]I am a traitor! oh, that I had fallen
When Regnault lifted high the murderous knife,
Regnault the instrument belike of those
Who now themselves would fain assassinate, 60
And legalise their murders. I stand here
An isolated patriot&mdash;hemmed around
By faction's noisy pack; beset and bay'd
By the foul hell-hounds who know no escape
From Justice' outstretch'd arm, but by the force 65
That pierces through her breast. [Murmurs, and shouts of&mdash;Down with the Tyrant!

Robespierre. Nay, but I will be heard. There was a time
When Robespierre began, the loud applauses
Of honest patriots drown'd the honest sound.
But times are chang'd, and villainy prevails. 70

Collot d'Herbois. No&mdash;villainy shall fall. France could not brook
A monarch's sway&mdash;sounds the dictator's name
More soothing to her ear?

Bourdon l'Oise. Rattle her chains
More musically now than when the hand
Of Brissot forged her fetters; or the crew 75
Of H&eacute;bert thundered out their blasphemies,
And Danton talk'd of virtue?

Robespierre. Oh, that Brissot
Were here again to thunder in this hall,
That H&eacute;bert lived, and Danton's giant form
Scowl'd once again defiance! so my soul 80
Might cope with worthy foes.
People of France,
Hear me! Beneath the vengeance of the law
Traitors have perish'd countless; more survive:
The hydra-headed faction lifts anew
Her daring front, and fruitful from her wounds, 85
Cautious from past defects, contrives new wiles
Against the sons of Freedom.

Tallien. Freedom lives!
Oppression falls&mdash;for France has felt her chains,
Has burst them too. Who traitor-like stept forth
Amid the hall of Jacobins to save 90
Camille Desmoulins, and the venal wretch
D'Eglantine?


[506]


Robespierre. I did&mdash;for I thought them honest.
And Heaven forefend that Vengeance e'er should strike,
Ere justice doom'd the blow.

Barrere. Traitor, thou didst.
Yes, the accomplice of their dark designs, 95
Awhile didst thou defend them, when the storm
Lower'd at safe distance. When the clouds frown'd darker,
Fear'd for yourself and left them to their fate.
Oh, I have mark'd thee long, and through the veil
Seen thy foul projects. Yes, ambitious man, 100
Self-will'd dictator o'er the realm of France,
The vengeance thou hast plann'd for patriots
Falls on thy head. Look how thy brother's deeds
Dishonour thine! He the firm patriot,
Thou the foul parricide of Liberty! 105

Robespierre Junior. Barrere&mdash;attempt not meanly to divide
Me from my brother. I partake his guilt,
For I partake his virtue.

Robespierre. Brother, by my soul,
More dear I hold thee to my heart, that thus
With me thou dar'st to tread the dangerous path 110
Of virtue, than that Nature twined her cords
Of kindred round us.

Barrere. Yes, allied in guilt,
Even as in blood ye are. O, thou worst wretch,
Thou worse than Sylla! hast thou not proscrib'd,
Yea, in most foul anticipation slaughter'd 115
Each patriot representative of France?

Bourdon l'Oise. Was not the younger Caesar too to reign
O'er all our valiant armies in the south,
And still continue there his merchant wiles?

Robespierre Junior. His merchant wiles! Oh, grant me patience, heaven! 120
Was it by merchant wiles I gain'd you back
Toulon, when proudly on her captive towers
Wav'd high the English flag? or fought I then
With merchant wiles, when sword in hand I led
Your troops to conquest? fought I merchant-like, 125
Or barter'd I for victory, when death
Strode o'er the reeking streets with giant stride,
And shook his ebon plumes, and sternly smil'd
Amid the bloody banquet? when appall'd
The hireling sons of England spread the sail 130
[507]
Of safety, fought I like a merchant then?
Oh, patience! patience!

Bourdon l'Oise. How this younger tyrant
Mouths out defiance to us! even so
He had led on the armies of the south,
Till once again the plains of France were drench'd 135
With her best blood.

Collot d'Herbois. Till once again display'd
Lyons' sad tragedy had call'd me forth
The minister of wrath, whilst slaughter by
Had bathed in human blood.

Dubois Cranc&eacute;. No wonder, friend,
That we are traitors&mdash;that our heads must fall 140
Beneath the axe of death! when Caesar-like
Reigns Robespierre, 'tis wisely done to doom
The fall of Brutus. Tell me, bloody man,
Hast thou not parcell'd out deluded France,
As it had been some province won in fight, 145
Between your curst triumvirate? You, Couthon,
Go with my brother to the southern plains;
St. Just, be yours the army of the north;
Meantime I rule at Paris.

Robespierre. Matchless knave!
What&mdash;not one blush of conscience on thy cheek&mdash; 150
Not one poor blush of truth! most likely tale!
That I who ruined Brissot's towering hopes,
I who discover'd H&eacute;bert's impious wiles,
And sharp'd for Danton's recreant neck the axe,
Should now be traitor! had I been so minded, 155
Think ye I had destroyed the very men
Whose plots resembled mine? bring forth your proofs
Of this deep treason. Tell me in whose breast
Found ye the fatal scroll? or tell me rather
Who forg'd the shameless falsehood?

Collot d'Herbois. Ask you proofs? 160
Robespierre, what proofs were ask'd when Brissot died?

Legendre. What proofs adduced you when the Danton died?
When at the imminent peril of my life
I rose, and fearless of thy frowning brow,
Proclaim'd him guiltless?

Robespierre. I remember well 165
The fatal day. I do repent me much
That I kill'd Caesar and spar'd Antony.
[508]But I have been too lenient. I have spared
The stream of blood, and now my own must flow
To fill the current. [Loud applauses.
Triumph not too soon, 170
Justice may yet be victor.


Enter St. Just, and mounts the Tribune.


St. Just. I come from the Committee&mdash;charged to speak
Of matters of high import. I omit
Their orders. Representatives of France,
Boldly in his own person speaks St. Just 175
What his own heart shall dictate.

Tallien. Hear ye this,
Insulted delegates of France? St. Just
From your Committee comes&mdash;comes charg'd to speak
Of matters of high import, yet omits
Their orders! Representatives of France, 180
That bold man I denounce, who disobeys
The nation's orders.&mdash;I denounce St. Just. [Loud applauses.

St. Just. Hear me! [Violent murmurs.

Robespierre. He shall be heard!

Bourdon l'Oise. Must we contaminate this sacred hall
With the foul breath of treason?

Collot d'Herbois. Drag him away! 185
Hence with him to the bar.

Couthon. Oh, just proceedings!
Robespierre prevented liberty of speech&mdash;
And Robespierre is a tyrant! Tallien reigns,
He dreads to hear the voice of innocence&mdash;
And St. Just must be silent!

Legendre. Heed we well 190
That justice guide our actions. No light import
Attends this day. I move St. Just be heard.

Freron. Inviolate be the sacred right of man.
The freedom of debate. [Violent applauses.

St. Just. I may be heard then! much the times are chang'd, 195
When St. Just thanks this hall for hearing him.
Robespierre is call'd a tyrant. Men of France,
Judge not too soon. By popular discontent
Was Aristides driven into exile,
Was Phocion murder'd. Ere ye dare pronounce 200
[509]
Robespierre is guilty, it befits ye well,
Consider who accuse him. Tallien,
Bourdon of Oise&mdash;the very men denounced,
For that their dark intrigues disturb'd the plan
Of government. Legendre the sworn friend 205
Of Danton, fall'n apostate. Dubois Cranc&eacute;,
He who at Lyons spared the royalists&mdash;
Collot d'Herbois&mdash;

Bourdon l'Oise. What&mdash;shall the traitor rear
His head amid our tribune&mdash;and blaspheme
Each patriot? shall the hireling slave of faction&mdash; 210

St. Just. I am of no one faction. I contend
Against all factions.

Tallien. I espouse the cause
Of truth. Robespierre on yester morn pronounced
Upon his own authority a report.
To-day St. Just comes down. St. Just neglects 215
What the Committee orders, and harangues
From his own will. O citizens of France
I weep for you&mdash;I weep for my poor country&mdash;
I tremble for the cause of Liberty,
When individuals shall assume the sway, 220
And with more insolence than kingly pride
Rule the Republic.

Billaud Varennes. Shudder, ye representatives of France,
Shudder with horror. Henriot commands
The marshall'd force of Paris. Henriot, 225
Foul parricide&mdash;the sworn ally of H&eacute;bert,
Denounced by all&mdash;upheld by Robespierre.
Who spar'd La Valette? who promoted him,
Stain'd with the deep dye of nobility?
Who to an ex-peer gave the high command? 230
Who screen'd from justice the rapacious thief?
Who cast in chains the friends of Liberty?
Robespierre, the self-stil'd patriot Robespierre&mdash;
Robespierre, allied with villain Daubign&eacute;&mdash;
Robespierre, the foul arch-tyrant Robespierre. 235

Bourdon l'Oise. He talks of virtue&mdash;of morality&mdash;
Consistent patriot! he Daubign&eacute;'s friend!
Henriot's supporter virtuous! preach of virtue,
Yet league with villains, for with Robespierre
Villains alone ally. Thou art a tyrant! 240
I stile thee tyrant, Robespierre! [Loud applauses.


[510]


Robespierre. Take back the name. Ye citizens of France&mdash; [Violent clamour. Cries of&mdash;Down with the Tyrant!

Tallien. Oppression falls. The traitor stands appall'd&mdash;
Guilt's iron fangs engrasp his shrinking soul&mdash;
He hears assembled France denounce his crimes! 245
He sees the mask torn from his secret sins&mdash;
He trembles on the precipice of fate.
Fall'n guilty tyrant! murder'd by thy rage
How many an innocent victim's blood has stain'd
Fair freedom's altar! Sylla-like thy hand 250
Mark'd down the virtues, that, thy foes removed,
Perpetual Dictator thou might'st reign,
And tyrannize o'er France, and call it freedom!
Long time in timid guilt the traitor plann'd
His fearful wiles&mdash;success emboldened sin&mdash; 255
And his stretch'd arm had grasp'd the diadem
Ere now, but that the coward's heart recoil'd,
Lest France awak'd should rouse her from her dream,
And call aloud for vengeance. He, like Caesar,
With rapid step urged on his bold career, 260
Even to the summit of ambitious power,
And deem'd the name of King alone was wanting.
Was it for this we hurl'd proud Capet down?
Is it for this we wage eternal war
Against the tyrant horde of murderers, 265
The crown&eacute;d cockatrices whose foul venom
Infects all Europe? was it then for this
We swore to guard our liberty with life,
That Robespierre should reign? the spirit of freedom
Is not yet sunk so low. The glowing flame 270
That animates each honest Frenchman's heart
Not yet extinguish'd. I invoke thy shade,
Immortal Brutus! I too wear a dagger;
And if the representatives of France,
Through fear or favour, should delay the sword 275
Of justice, Tallien emulates thy virtues;
Tallien, like Brutus, lifts the avenging arm;
Tallien shall save his country. [Violent applauses.

Billaud Varennes. I demand
The arrest of all the traitors. Memorable
Will be this day for France.

Robespierre. Yes! Memorable 280
This day will be for France&mdash;for villains triumph.


[511]


Lebas. I will not share in this day's damning guilt.
Condemn me too. [Great cry&mdash;Down with the Tyrants!


(The two Robespierres, Couthon, St. Just, and Lebas are led off.)



ACT III

Scene continues.


Collot d'Herbois. Caesar is fall'n! The baneful tree of Java,
Whose death-distilling boughs dropt poisonous dew,
Is rooted from its base. This worse than Cromwell,
The austere, the self-denying Robespierre,
Even in this hall, where once with terror mute 5
We listen'd to the hypocrite's harangues,
Has heard his doom.

Billaud Varennes. Yet must we not suppose
The tyrant will fall tamely. His sworn hireling
Henriot, the daring desperate Henriot,
Commands the force of Paris. I denounce him. 10

Freron. I denounce Fleuriot too, the mayor of Paris.


Enter Dubois Cranc&eacute;.


Dubois Cranc&eacute;. Robespierre is rescued. Henriot at the head
Of the arm'd force has rescued the fierce tyrant.

Collot d'Herbois. Ring the tocsin&mdash;call all the citizens
To save their country&mdash;never yet has Paris 15
Forsook the representatives of France.

Tallien. It is the hour of danger. I propose
This sitting be made permanent. [Loud applauses.

Collot d'Herbois. The National Convention shall remain
Firm at its post. 20


Enter a Messenger.


Messenger. Robespierre has reach'd the Commune. They espouse
The tyrant's cause. St. Just is up in arms!
St. Just&mdash;the young ambitious bold St. Just
Harangues the mob. The sanguinary Couthon
Thirsts for your blood. [Tocsin rings. 25

Tallien. These tyrants are in arms against the law:
Outlaw the rebels.


[512]
Enter Merlin of Douay.


Merlin. Health to the representatives of France!
I past this moment through the arm&eacute;d force&mdash;
They ask'd my name&mdash;and when they heard a delegate, 30
Swore I was not the friend of France.

Collot d'Herbois. The tyrants threaten us as when they turn'd
The cannon's mouth on Brissot.


Enter another Messenger.


Second Messenger. Vivier harangues the Jacobins&mdash;the Club
Espouse the cause of Robespierre. 35


Enter another Messenger.


Third Messenger. All's lost&mdash;the tyrant triumphs. Henriot leads
The soldiers to his aid.&mdash;Already I hear
The rattling cannon destined to surround
This sacred hall.

Tallien. Why, we will die like men then.
The representatives of France dare death, 40
When duty steels their bosoms. [Loud applauses.

Tallien (addressing the galleries). Citizens!
France is insulted in her delegates&mdash;
The majesty of the Republic is insulted&mdash;
Tyrants are up in arms. An arm&eacute;d force
Threats the Convention. The Convention swears 45
To die, or save the country! [Violent applauses from the galleries.

Citizen (from above). We too swear
To die, or save the country. Follow me. [All the men quit the galleries.


Enter another Messenger.


Fourth Messenger. Henriot is taken! [Loud applauses.
Three of your brave soldiers
Swore they would seize the rebel slave of tyrants,
Or perish in the attempt. As he patroll'd 50
The streets of Paris, stirring up the mob,
They seiz'd him. [Applauses.

Billaud Varennes. Let the names of these brave men
Live to the future day.


[513]
Enter Bourdon l'Oise, sword in hand.


Bourdon l'Oise. I have clear'd the Commune. [Applauses.
Through the throng I rush'd,
Brandishing my good sword to drench its blade 55
Deep in the tyrant's heart. The timid rebels
Gave way. I met the soldiery&mdash;I spake
Of the dictator's crimes&mdash;of patriots chain'd
In dark deep dungeons by his lawless rage&mdash;
Of knaves secure beneath his fostering power. 60
I spake of Liberty. Their honest hearts
Caught the warm flame. The general shout burst forth,
'Live the Convention&mdash;Down with Robespierre!' [Applauses.


(Shouts from without&mdash;Down with the Tyrant!)


Tallien. I hear, I hear the soul-inspiring sounds,
France shall be saved! her generous sons attached 65
To principles, not persons, spurn the idol
They worshipp'd once. Yes, Robespierre shall fall
As Capet fell! Oh! never let us deem
That France shall crouch beneath a tyrant's throne,
That the almighty people who have broke 70
On their oppressors' heads the oppressive chain,
Will court again their fetters! easier were it
To hurl the cloud-capt mountain from its base,
Than force the bonds of slavery upon men
Determined to be free! [Applauses. 75


Enter Legendre&mdash;a pistol in one hand, keys in the other.


Legendre (flinging down the keys). So&mdash;let the mutinous Jacobins meet now
In the open air. [Loud applauses.
A factious turbulent party
Lording it o'er the state since Danton died,
And with him the Cordeliers.&mdash;A hireling band
Of loud-tongued orators controull'd the Club, 80
And bade them bow the knee to Robespierre.
Vivier has 'scaped me. Curse his coward heart&mdash;
This fate-fraught tube of Justice in my hand,
I rush'd into the hall. He mark'd mine eye
That beam'd its patriot anger, and flash'd full 85
With death-denouncing meaning. 'Mid the throng
He mingled. I pursued&mdash;but stay'd my hand,
Lest haply I might shed the innocent blood. [Applauses.


[514]


Freron. They took from me my ticket of admission&mdash;
Expell'd me from their sittings.&mdash;Now, forsooth, 90
Humbled and trembling re-insert my name.
But Freron enters not the Club again
'Till it be purged of guilt:&mdash;'till, purified
Of tyrants and of traitors, honest men
May breathe the air in safety. 95
[Shouts from without.

Barrere. What means this uproar! if the tyrant band
Should gain the people once again to rise&mdash;
We are as dead!

Tallien. And wherefore fear we death?
Did Brutus fear it? or the Grecian friends
Who buried in Hipparchus' breast the sword, 100
And died triumphant? Caesar should fear death,
Brutus must scorn the bugbear.


(Shouts from without&mdash;Live the Convention!&mdash;Down with the Tyrants!)


Tallien. Hark! again
The sounds of honest Freedom!


Enter Deputies from the Sections.


Citizen. Citizens! representatives of France!
Hold on your steady course. The men of Paris 105
Espouse your cause. The men of Paris swear
They will defend the delegates of Freedom.

Tallien. Hear ye this, Colleagues? hear ye this, my brethren?
And does no thrill of joy pervade your breasts?
My bosom bounds to rapture. I have seen 110
The sons of France shake off the tyrant yoke;
I have, as much as lies in mine own arm,
Hurl'd down the usurper.&mdash;Come death when it will,
I have lived long enough. [Shouts without.

Barrere. Hark! how the noise increases! through the gloom 115
Of the still evening&mdash;harbinger of death,
Rings the tocsin! the dreadful generale
Thunders through Paris&mdash; [Cry without&mdash;Down with the Tyrant!


Enter Lecointre.


Lecointre. So may eternal justice blast the foes
Of France! so perish all the tyrant brood, 120
[515]
As Robespierre has perish'd! Citizens,
Caesar is taken. [Loud and repeated applauses.
I marvel not that with such fearless front
He braved our vengeance, and with angry eye
Scowled round the hall defiance. He relied 125
On Henriot's aid&mdash;the Commune's villain friendship,
And Henriot's boughten succours. Ye have heard
How Henriot rescued him&mdash;how with open arms
The Commune welcom'd in the rebel tyrant&mdash;
How Fleuriot aided, and seditious Vivier 130
Stirr'd up the Jacobins. All had been lost&mdash;
The representatives of France had perish'd&mdash;
Freedom had sunk beneath the tyrant arm
Of this foul parricide, but that her spirit
Inspir'd the men of Paris. Henriot call'd 135
'To arms' in vain, whilst Bourdon's patriot voice
Breathed eloquence, and o'er the Jacobins
Legendre frown'd dismay. The tyrants fled&mdash;
They reach'd the H&ocirc;tel. We gather'd round&mdash;we call'd
For vengeance! Long time, obstinate in despair, 140
With knives they hack'd around them. 'Till foreboding
The sentence of the law, the clamorous cry
Of joyful thousands hailing their destruction,
Each sought by suicide to escape the dread
Of death. Lebas succeeded. From the window 145
Leapt the younger Robespierre, but his fractur'd limb
Forbade to escape. The self-will'd dictator
Plunged often the keen knife in his dark breast,
Yet impotent to die. He lives all mangled
By his own tremulous hand! All gash'd and gored 150
He lives to taste the bitterness of death.
Even now they meet their doom. The bloody Couthon,
The fierce St. Just, even now attend their tyrant
To fall beneath the axe. I saw the torches
Flash on their visages a dreadful light&mdash; 155
I saw them whilst the black blood roll'd adown
Each stern face, even then with dauntless eye
Scowl round contemptuous, dying as they lived,
Fearless of fate! [Loud and repeated applauses.

Barrere mounts the Tribune. For ever hallowed be this glorious day, 160
When Freedom, bursting her oppressive chain,
Tramples on the oppressor. When the tyrant
[516]
Hurl'd from his blood-cemented throne, by the arm
Of the almighty people, meets the death
He plann'd for thousands. Oh! my sickening heart 165
Has sunk within me, when the various woes
Of my brave country crowded o'er my brain
In ghastly numbers&mdash;when assembled hordes,
Dragg'd from their hovels by despotic power,
Rush'd o'er her frontiers, plunder'd her fair hamlets, 170
And sack'd her populous towns, and drench'd with blood
The reeking fields of Flanders.&mdash;When within,
Upon her vitals prey'd the rankling tooth
Of treason; and oppression, giant form,
Trampling on freedom, left the alternative 175
Of slavery, or of death. Even from that day,
When, on the guilty Capet, I pronounced
The doom of injured France, has faction reared
Her hated head amongst us. Roland preach'd
Of mercy&mdash;the uxorious dotard Roland, 180
The woman-govern'd Roland durst aspire
To govern France; and Petion talk'd of virtue,
And Vergniaud's eloquence, like the honeyed tongue
Of some soft Syren wooed us to destruction.
We triumphed over these. On the same scaffold 185
Where the last Louis pour'd his guilty blood,
Fell Brissot's head, the womb of darksome treasons,
And Orleans, villain kinsman of the Capet,
And H&eacute;bert's atheist crew, whose maddening hand
Hurl'd down the altars of the living God, 190
With all the infidel's intolerance.
The last worst traitor triumphed&mdash;triumph'd long,
Secur'd by matchless villainy&mdash;by turns
Defending and deserting each accomplice
As interest prompted. In the goodly soil 195
Of Freedom, the foul tree of treason struck
Its deep-fix'd roots, and dropt the dews of death
On all who slumber'd in its specious shade.
He wove the web of treachery. He caught
The listening crowd by his wild eloquence, 200
His cool ferocity that persuaded murder,
Even whilst it spake of mercy!&mdash;never, never
Shall this regenerated country wear
The despot yoke. Though myriads round assail,
And with worse fury urge this new crusade 205
[517]
Than savages have known; though the leagued despots
Depopulate all Europe, so to pour
The accumulated mass upon our coasts,
Sublime amid the storm shall France arise,
And like the rock amid surrounding waves 210
Repel the rushing ocean.&mdash;She shall wield
The thunder-bolt of vengeance&mdash;she shall blast
The despot's pride, and liberate the world!

FOOTNOTES:

[518:1] First published in 1873 by Mr. John Pearson (under the
editorship of R. H. Shepherd): included in P. and D. W. 1877-80, and
in P. W. 1893.

Four MSS. are (or were) extant, (1) the transcript of the play as sent
to Sheridan in 1797 (MS. I); (2) a contemporary transcript sent by
Coleridge to a friend (MS. II); (3) a third transcript (the
handwriting of a 'legal character') sold at Christie's, March 8, 1895
(MS. III); (4) a copy of Act I in Coleridge's handwriting, which
formerly belonged to Thomas Poole, and is now in the British Museum
(MS. P.). The text of the present issue follows MS. I. The variants
are derived from MSS. I, II as noted by J. Dykes Campbell in P. W.
1893, from a MS. collation (by J. D. Campbell) of MS. III, now published
for the first time, and from a fresh collation of MS. P.

Osorio was begun at Stowey in March, 1797. Two and a half Acts were
written before June, four and a half Acts before September 13, 1797. A
transcript of the play (MS. I) was sent to Drury Lane in October, and
rejected, on the score of the 'obscurity of the last three acts', on or
about December 1, 1797. See 'Art.' Coleridge, Osorio and Remorse, by
J. D. Campbell, Athenaeum, April 8, 1890.

In the reign of Philip II shortly after the civil war against the Moors,
and during the heat of the Persecution which raged against them. Maria
an orphan of fortune had been espoused to Albert the eldest son of Lord
Velez, but he having been supposed dead, is now addressed by Osorio the
brother of Albert.

In the character of Osorio I wished to represent a man, who, from his
childhood had mistaken constitutional abstinence from vices, for
strength of character&mdash;thro' his pride duped into guilt, and then
endeavouring to shield himself from the reproaches of his own mind by
misanthropy.

Don Garcia (supposed dead) and Valdez father of Don Ordo&ntilde;o, and Guardian
of Teresa di Monviedro. Don Garcia eldest son of the Marquis di Valdez,
supposed dead, having been six years absent, and for the last three
without any tidings of him.

Teresa Sen&ntilde;ora [sic] di Monviedro, an orphan lady, bequeathed by both
Parents on their death-bed to the wardship of the Marquis, and betrothed
to Don Garcia&mdash;Gulinaez a Moorish Chieftain and ostensibly a new
Christian&mdash;Alhadra his wife. MS. III.

ACT THE FIRST[519:1]

Scene&mdash;The sea shore on the coast of Granada.

Velez, Maria.


Maria. I hold Osorio dear: he is your son,
And Albert's brother.

Velez. Love him for himself,
Nor make the living wretched for the dead.

Maria. I mourn that you should plead in vain, Lord Velez!
But Heaven hath heard my vow, and I remain 5
Faithful to Albert, be he dead or living.

Velez. Heaven knows with what delight I saw your loves;
And could my heart's blood give him back to thee
I would die smiling. But these are idle thoughts!
Thy dying father comes upon my soul 10
With that same look, with which he gave thee to me:
[520]
I held thee in mine arms, a powerless babe,
While thy poor mother with a mute entreaty
Fix'd her faint eyes on mine: ah, not for this,
That I should let thee feed thy soul with gloom, 15
And with slow anguish wear away thy life,
The victim of a useless constancy.
I must not see thee wretched.

Maria. There are woes
Ill-barter'd for the garishness of joy!
If it be wretched with an untired eye 20
To watch those skiey tints, and this green ocean;
Or in the sultry hour beneath some rock,
My hair dishevell'd by the pleasant sea-breeze,
To shape sweet visions, and live o'er again
All past hours of delight; if it be wretched 25
To watch some bark, and fancy Albert there;
To go through each minutest circumstance
Of the bless'd meeting, and to frame adventures
Most terrible and strange, and hear him tell them:
(As once I knew a crazy Moorish maid, 30
Who dress'd her in her buried lover's cloaths,
And o'er the smooth spring in the mountain cleft
Hung with her lute, and play'd the selfsame tune
He used to play, and listen'd to the shadow
Herself had made); if this be wretchedness, 35
And if indeed it be a wretched thing
To trick out mine own death-bed, and imagine
That I had died&mdash;died, just ere his return;
Then see him listening to my constancy;
And hover round, as he at midnight ever 40
Sits on my grave and gazes at the moon;
Or haply in some more fantastic mood
To be in Paradise, and with choice flowers
Build up a bower where he and I might dwell,
And there to wait his coming! O my sire! 45
My Albert's sire! if this be wretchedness
That eats away the life, what were it, think you,
If in a most assur'd reality
He should return, and see a brother's infant
Smile at him from my arms? [Clasping her forehead.
[521]
O what a thought! 50
'Twas horrible! it pass'd my brain like lightning.

Velez. 'Twere horrible, if but one doubt remain'd
The very week he promised his return.

Maria. Ah, what a busy joy was ours&mdash;to see him
After his three years' travels! tho' that absence 55
His still-expected, never-failing letters
Almost endear'd to me! Even then what tumult!

Velez. O power of youth to feed on pleasant thoughts
Spite of conviction! I am old and heartless!
Yes, I am old&mdash;I have no pleasant dreams&mdash; 60
Hectic and unrefresh'd with rest.

Maria (with great tenderness).  My father!

Velez. Aye, 'twas the morning thou didst try to cheer me
With a fond gaiety. My heart was bursting,
And yet I could not tell me, how my sleep
Was throng'd with swarthy faces, and I saw 65
The merchant-ship in which my son was captured&mdash;
Well, well, enough&mdash;captured in sight of land&mdash;
We might almost have seen it from our house-top!


[522]


Maria (abruptly). He did not perish there!

Velez (impatiently). Nay, nay&mdash;how aptly thou forgett'st a tale 70
Thou ne'er didst wish to learn&mdash;my brave Osorio
Saw them both founder in the storm that parted
Him and the pirate: both the vessels founder'd.
Gallant Osorio! [Pauses, then tenderly.
O belov'd Maria,
Would'st thou best prove thy faith to generous Albert 75
And most delight his spirit, go and make
His brother happy, make his ag&eacute;d father
Sink to the grave with joy!

Maria. For mercy's sake
Press me no more. I have no power to love him!
His proud forbidding eye, and his dark brow 80
Chill me, like dew-damps of the unwholesome night.
My love, a timorous and tender flower,
Closes beneath his touch.

Velez. You wrong him, maiden.
You wrong him, by my soul! Nor was it well
To character by such unkindly phrases 85
The stir and workings of that love for you
Which he has toil'd to smother. 'Twas not well&mdash;
Nor is it grateful in you to forget
His wounds and perilous voyages, and how
With an heroic fearlessness of danger 90
He roamed the coast of Afric for your Albert.
It was not well&mdash;you have moved me even to tears.

Maria. O pardon me, my father! pardon me.
It was a foolish and ungrateful speech,
A most ungrateful speech! But I am hurried 95
Beyond myself, if I but dream of one
Who aims to rival Albert. Were we not
Born on one day, like twins of the same parent?
Nursed in one cradle? Pardon me, my father!
A six years' absence is an heavy thing; 100
Yet still the hope survives&mdash;&mdash;

Velez (looking forwards). Hush&mdash;hush! Maria.

[523]

Maria. It is Francesco, our Inquisitor;
That busy man, gross, ignorant, and cruel!


Enter Francesco and Alhadra.


Francesco (to Velez). Where is your son, my lord? Oh! here he comes.


Enter Osorio.


My Lord Osorio! this Moresco woman 105
(Alhadra is her name) asks audience of you.

Osorio. Hail, reverend father! What may be the business?

Francesco. O the old business&mdash;a Mohammedan!
The officers are in her husband's house,
And would have taken him, but that he mention'd 110
Your name, asserting that you were his friend,
[524]
Aye, and would warrant him a Catholic.
But I know well these children of perdition,
And all their idle fals[e]hoods to gain time;
So should have made the officers proceed, 115
But that this woman with most passionate outcries,
(Kneeling and holding forth her infants to me)
So work'd upon me, who (you know, my lord!)
Have human frailties, and am tender-hearted,
That I came with her.

Osorio. You are merciful. [Looking at Alhadra. 120
I would that I could serve you; but in truth
Your face is new to me.


[Alhadra is about to speak, but is interrupted by


Francesco. Aye, aye&mdash;I thought so;
And so I said to one of the familiars.
A likely story, said I, that Osorio,
The gallant nobleman, who fought so bravely 125
Some four years past against these rebel Moors;
Working so hard from out the garden of faith
To eradicate these weeds detestable;
That he should countenance this vile Moresco,
Nay, be his friend&mdash;and warrant him, forsooth! 130
Well, well, my lord! it is a warning to me;
Now I return.

Alhadra. My lord, my husband's name
Is Ferdinand: you may remember it.
Three years ago&mdash;three years this very week&mdash;
You left him at Almeria.

Francesco (triumphantly). Palpably false! 135
This very week, three years ago, my lord!
(You needs must recollect it by your wound)
You were at sea, and fought the Moorish fiends
Who took and murder'd your poor brother Albert.


[Maria looks at Francesco with disgust and horror. Osorio's
appearance to be collected from the speech that follows.

[525]


Francesco (to Velez and pointing to Osorio). What? is he ill, my lord? How strange he looks! 140

Velez (angrily). You started on him too abruptly, father!
The fate of one, on whom you know he doted.

Osorio (starting as in a sudden agitation). O heavens!
I doted! [Then, as if recovering himself.
Yes! I doted on him!


[Osorio walks to the end of the stage. Velez follows soothing him.


Maria (her eye following them). I do not, cannot love him. Is my heart hard?
Is my heart hard? that even now the thought 145
Should force itself upon me&mdash;yet I feel it!

Francesco. The drops did start and stand upon his forehead!
I will return&mdash;in very truth I grieve
To have been the occasion. Ho! attend me, woman!

Alhadra (to Maria). O gentle lady, make the father stay 150
Till that my lord recover. I am sure
That he will say he is my husband's friend.

Maria. Stay, father, stay&mdash;my lord will soon recover.


[Osorio and Velez returning.


Osorio (to Velez as they return). Strange! that this Francesco
Should have the power so to distemper me. 155

Velez. Nay, 'twas an amiable weakness, son!

Francesco (to Osorio). My lord, I truly grieve&mdash;&mdash;

Osorio. Tut! name it not.
A sudden seizure, father! think not of it.
As to this woman's husband, I do know him:
I know him well, and that he is a Christian. 160

Francesco. I hope, my lord, your sensibility
Doth not prevail.

Osorio. Nay, nay&mdash;you know me better.
You hear what I have said. But 'tis a trifle.
I had something here of more importance. [Touching his forehead as if in the act of recollection.
[526]
Hah!
The Count Mondejar, our great general, 165
Writes, that the bishop we were talking of
Has sicken'd dangerously.

Francesco. Even so.

Osorio. I must return my answer.

Francesco. When, my lord?

Osorio. To-morrow morning, and shall not forget
How bright and strong your zeal for the Catholic faith. 170

Francesco. You are too kind, my lord! You overwhelm me.

Osorio. Nay, say not so. As for this Ferdinand,
'Tis certain that he was a Catholic.
What changes may have happen'd in three years,
I cannot say, but grant me this, good father! 175
I'll go and sift him: if I find him sound,
You'll grant me your authority and name
To liberate his house.

Francesco. My lord you have it.

Osorio (to Alhadra). I will attend you home within an hour.
Meantime return with us, and take refreshment. 180

Alhadra. Not till my husband's free, I may not do it.
I will stay here.

Maria (aside). Who is this Ferdinand?

Velez. Daughter!

Maria. With your permission, my dear lord,
I'll loiter a few minutes, and then join you.


[Exeunt Velez, Francesco, and Osorio.


Alhadra. Hah! there he goes. A bitter curse go with him. 185
A scathing curse!


[Alhadra had been betrayed by the warmth of her feelings into an
imprudence. She checks herself, yet recollecting Maria's manner
towards Francesco, says in a shy and distrustful manner


You hate him, don't you, lady!


[527]


Maria. Nay, fear me not! my heart is sad for you.

Alhadra. These fell Inquisitors, these sons of blood!
As I came on, his face so madden'd me
That ever and anon I clutch'd my dagger 190
And half unsheathed it.

Maria. Be more calm, I pray you.

Alhadra. And as he stalk'd along the narrow path
Close on the mountain's edge, my soul grew eager.
'Twas with hard toil I made myself remember
That his foul officers held my babes and husband. 195
To have leapt upon him with a Tyger's plunge
And hurl'd him down the ragged precipice,
O&mdash;it had been most sweet!

Maria. Hush, hush! for shame.
Where is your woman's heart?

Alhadra. O gentle lady!
You have no skill to guess my many wrongs, 200
Many and strange. Besides I am a Christian,
And they do never pardon, 'tis their faith!

Maria. Shame fall on those who so have shown it to thee!

Alhadra. I know that man; 'tis well he knows not me!
Five years ago, and he was the prime agent. 205
Five years ago the Holy Brethren seized me.

Maria. What might your crime be?

Alhadra. Solely my complexion.
They cast me, then a young and nursing mother,
Into a dungeon of their prison house.
There was no bed, no fire, no ray of light, 210
No touch, no sound of comfort! The black air,
[528]
It was a toil to breathe it! I have seen
The gaoler's lamp, the moment that he enter'd,
How the flame sunk at once down to the socket.
O miserable, by that lamp to see 215
My infant quarrelling with the coarse hard bread
Brought daily: for the little wretch was sickly&mdash;
My rage had dry'd away its natural food!
In darkness I remain'd, counting the clocks[528:1]
Which haply told me that the blessed sun 220
Was rising on my garden. When I dozed,
My infant's moanings mingled with my dreams
And wak'd me. If you were a mother, Lady,
I should scarce dare to tell you, that its noises
And peevish cries so fretted on my brain 225
That I have struck the innocent babe in anger!

Maria. O God! it is too horrible to hear!

Alhadra. What was it then to suffer? 'Tis most right
That such as you should hear it. Know you not
What Nature makes you mourn, she bids you heal? 230
Great evils ask great passions to redress them,
And whirlwinds fitliest scatter pestilence.

Maria. You were at length deliver'd?

Alhadra. Yes, at length
I saw the blessed arch of the whole heaven.
'Twas the first time my infant smiled! No more. 235
For if I dwell upon that moment, lady,
A fit comes on, which makes me o'er again
All I then was, my knees hang loose and drag,
And my lip falls with such an ideot laugh
That you would start and shudder!

Maria. But your husband? 240

Alhadra. A month's imprisonment would kill him, lady!

Maria. Alas, poor man!

Alhadra. He hath a lion's courage,
[529]
But is not stern enough for fortitude.
Unfit for boisterous times, with gentle heart
He worships Nature in the hill and valley, 245
Not knowing what he loves, but loves it all!


[Enter Albert disguised as a Moresco, and in Moorish garments.


Albert (not observing Maria and Alhadra). Three weeks have I been loitering here, nor ever
Have summon'd up my heart to ask one question,
Or stop one peasant passing on this way.

Maria. Know you that man?

Alhadra. His person, not his name. 250
I doubt not, he is some Moresco chieftain
Who hides himself among the Alpuxarras.
A week has scarcely pass'd since first I saw him;
He has new-roof'd the desolate old cottage
Where Zagri lived&mdash;who dared avow the prophet 255
And died like one of the faithful! There he lives,
And a friend with him.

Maria. Does he know his danger
So near this seat?

Alhadra. He wears the Moorish robes too,
[530]
As in defiance of the royal edict.


[Alhadra advances to Albert, who has walked to the back
of the stage near the rocks. Maria drops her veil.


Alhadra. Gallant Moresco! you are near the castle 260
Of the Lord Velez, and hard by does dwell
A priest, the creature of the Inquisition.

Albert (retiring). You have mistaken me&mdash;I am a Christian.

Alhadra (to Maria). He deems that we are plotting to ensnare him.
Speak to him, lady! none can hear you speak 265
And not believe you innocent of guile.


[Albert, on hearing this, pauses and turns round.


Maria. If aught enforce you to concealment, sir!

Alhadra. He trembles strangely.


[Albert sinks down and hides his face in his garment [robe Remorse].


Maria. See&mdash;we have disturb'd him.
[Approaches nearer to him.
I pray you, think us friends&mdash;uncowl your face,
For you seem faint, and the night-breeze blows healing. 270
I pray you, think us friends!

Albert (raising his head).  Calm&mdash;very calm;
'Tis all too tranquil for reality!
And she spoke to me with her innocent voice.
That voice! that innocent voice! She is no traitress!
It was a dream, a phantom of my sleep, 275
A lying dream. [He starts up, and abruptly addresses her.
Maria! you are not wedded?

Maria (haughtily to Alhadra). Let us retire.
[They advance to the front of the stage.

Alhadra. He is indeed a Christian.
[531]
Some stray Sir Knight, that falls in love of a sudden.

Maria. What can this mean? How should he know my name?
It seems all shadowy.

Alhadra. Here he comes again. 280

Albert (aside). She deems me dead, and yet no mourning garment!
Why should my brother's wife wear mourning garments?
God of all mercy, make me, make me quiet! [To Maria.
Your pardon, gentle maid! that I disturb'd you.
I had just started from a frightful dream. 285

Alhadra. These renegado Moors&mdash;how soon they learn
The crimes and follies of their Christian tyrants!

Albert. I dreamt I had a friend, on whom I lean'd
With blindest trust, and a betroth&eacute;d maid
Whom I was wont to call not mine, but me, 290
For mine own self seem'd nothing, lacking her!
This maid so idoliz'd, that trusted friend,
Polluted in my absence soul and body!
And she with him and he with her conspired
[532]
To have me murder'd in a wood of the mountains: 295
But by my looks and most impassion'd words
I roused the virtues, that are dead in no man,
Even in the assassins' hearts. They made their terms,
And thank'd me for redeeming them from murder.

Alhadra (to Maria). You are lost in thought. Hear him no more, sweet lady! 300

Maria. From morn to night I am myself a dreamer,
And slight things bring on me the idle mood.
Well, sir, what happen'd then?

Albert. On a rude rock,
A rock, methought, fast by a grove of firs
Whose threaddy leaves to the low breathing gale 305
Made a soft sound most like the distant ocean,
I stay'd as tho' the hour of death were past,
And I were sitting in the world of spirits,
For all things seem'd unreal! There I sate.
The dews fell clammy, and the night descended, 310
Black, sultry, close! and ere the midnight hour
A storm came on, mingling all sounds of fear
That woods and sky and mountains seem'd one havock!
The second flash of lightning show'd a tree
Hard by me, newly-scathed. I rose tumultuous: 315
My soul work'd high: I bared my head to the storm,
And with loud voice and clamorous agony
Kneeling I pray'd to the great Spirit that made me,
Pray'd that Remorse might fasten on their hearts,
And cling, with poisonous tooth, inextricable 320
As the gored lion's bite!

Maria. A fearful curse!

Alhadra. But dreamt you not that you return'd and kill'd him?
Dreamt you of no revenge?

Albert (his voice trembling, and in tones of deep distress). She would have died,
Died in her sins&mdash;perchance, by her own hands!
[533]
And bending o'er her self-inflicted wounds 325
I might have met the evil glance of frenzy
And leapt myself into an unblest grave!
I pray'd for the punishment that cleanses hearts,
For still I loved her!

Alhadra. And you dreamt all this?

Maria. My soul is full of visions, all is wild! 330

Alhadra. There is no room in this heart for puling love-tales.
Lady! your servants there seem seeking us.

Maria (lifts up her veil and advances to Albert). Stranger, farewell! I guess not who you are,
Nor why you so address'd your tale to me.
Your mien is noble, and, I own, perplex'd me 335
With obscure memory of something past,
Which still escap'd my efforts, or presented
Tricks of a fancy pamper'd with long-wishing.
If (as it sometimes happens) our rude startling,
While your full heart was shaping out its dream, 340
Drove you to this, your not ungentle wildness,
You have my sympathy, and so farewell!
But if some undiscover'd wrongs oppress you,
And you need strength to drag them into light,
The generous Velez, and my Lord Osorio 345
Have arm and will to aid a noble sufferer,
Nor shall you want my favourable pleading.
[Exeunt Maria and Alhadra.

Albert (alone). 'Tis strange! it cannot be! my Lord Osorio!
Her Lord Osorio! Nay, I will not do it.
I curs'd him once, and one curse is enough. 350
[534]How sad she look'd and pale! but not like guilt,
And her calm tones&mdash;sweet as a song of mercy!
If the bad spirit retain'd his angel's voice,
Hell scarce were hell. And why not innocent?
Who meant to murder me might well cheat her. 355
But ere she married him, he had stain'd her honour.
Ah! there I am hamper'd. What if this were a lie
Fram'd by the assassin? who should tell it him
If it were truth? Osorio would not tell him.
Yet why one lie? All else, I know, was truth. 360
No start! no jealousy of stirring conscience!
And she referr'd to me&mdash;fondly, methought!
Could she walk here, if that she were a traitress?
Here where we play'd together in our childhood?
Here where we plighted vows? Where her cold cheek 365
Received my last kiss, when with suppress'd feelings
She had fainted in my arms? It cannot be!
'Tis not in nature! I will die, believing
That I shall meet her where no evil is,
No treachery, no cup dash'd from the lips! 370
I'll haunt this scene no more&mdash;live she in peace!
Her husband&mdash;ay, her husband! May this Angel
New-mould his canker'd heart! Assist me, Heaven!
That I may pray for my poor guilty brother!

But that he made appeal to you, my lord,
As surety for his soundness in the faith.
Tho' lesson'd by experience what small trust

[535]
ACT THE SECOND

Scene the First.&mdash;A wild and mountainous country. Osorio and Ferdinand
are discovered at a little distance from a house, which stands under the
brow of a slate rock, the rock covered with vines.

Ferdinand and Osorio.


Ferdinand. Thrice you have sav'd my life. Once in the battle
You gave it me, next rescued me from suicide,
When for my follies I was made to wander
With mouths to feed, and not a morsel for them.
Now, but for you, a dungeon's slimy stones 5
Had pillow'd my snapt joints.

Osorio. Good Ferdinand!
Why this to me? It is enough you know it.

Ferdinand. A common trick of gratitude, my lord!
Seeking to ease her own full heart.

Osorio. Enough.
A debt repay'd ceases to be a debt. 10
You have it in your power to serve me greatly.

Ferdinand. As how, my lord? I pray you name the thing!
I would climb up an ice-glaz'd precipice
To pluck a weed you fancied.

Osorio (with embarrassment and hesitation). Why&mdash;that&mdash;lady&mdash;

Ferdinand. 'Tis now three years, my lord! since last I saw you. 15
Have you a son, my lord?

Osorio. O miserable! [Aside.
Ferdinand! you are a man, and know this world.
[536]
I told you what I wish'd&mdash;now for the truth!
She lov'd the man you kill'd!

Ferdinand (looking as suddenly alarmed). You jest, my lord?

Osorio. And till his death is proved, she will not wed me. 20

Ferdinand. You sport with me, my lord?

Osorio. Come, come, this foolery
Lives only in thy looks&mdash;thy heart disowns it.

Ferdinand. I can bear this, and anything more grievous
From you, my lord!&mdash;but how can I serve you here?

Osorio. Why, you can mouth set speeches solemnly, 25
Wear a quaint garment, make mysterious antics.

[Ferdinand. I am dull, my lord! I do not comprehend you.

Osorio. In blunt terms] you can play the sorcerer.
She has no faith in Holy Church, 'tis true.
Her lover school'd her in some newer nonsense: 30
Yet still a tale of spirits works on her.
She is a lone enthusiast, sensitive,
Shivers, and cannot keep the tears in her eye.
Such ones do love the marvellous too well
Not to believe it. We will wind her up 35
With a strange music, that she knows not of,
With fumes of frankincense, and mummery&mdash;
Then leave, as one sure token of his death,
That portrait, which from off the dead man's neck
I bade thee take, the trophy of thy conquest. 40


[537]


Ferdinand (with hesitation). Just now I should have cursed the man who told me
You could ask aught, my lord! and I refuse.
But this I cannot do.

Osorio. Where lies your scruple?

Ferdinand. That shark Francesco.

Osorio. O! an o'ersiz'd gudgeon!
I baited, sir, my hook with a painted mitre, 45
And now I play with him at the end of the line.
Well&mdash;and what next?

Ferdinand (stammering). Next, next&mdash;my lord!
You know you told me that the lady loved you,
Had loved you with incautious tenderness.
That if the young man, her betroth&eacute;d husband, 50
Return'd, yourself, and she, and an unborn babe,
Must perish. Now, my lord! to be a man!

Osorio (aloud, though to express his contempt he speaks in the third person). This fellow is a man! he kill'd for hire
One whom he knew not&mdash;yet has tender scruples.
[Then turning to Ferdinand.
Thy hums and ha's, thy whine and stammering. 55
Pish&mdash;fool! thou blunder'st through the devil's book,
Spelling thy villany!

Ferdinand. My lord&mdash;my lord!
I can bear much, yes, very much from you.
But there's a point where sufferance is meanness!
I am no villain, never kill'd for hire. 60
My gratitude&mdash;&mdash;

Osorio. O! aye, your gratitude!
'Twas a well-sounding word&mdash;what have you done with it?

Ferdinand. Who proffers his past favours for my virtue
Tries to o'erreach me, is a very sharper,
[538]
And should not speak of gratitude, my lord! 65
I knew not 'twas your brother!

Osorio (evidently alarmed).  And who told you?

Ferdinand. He himself told me.

Osorio. Ha! you talk'd with him?
And those, the two Morescoes, that went with you?

Ferdinand. Both fell in a night-brawl at Malaga.

Osorio (in a low voice). My brother!

Ferdinand. Yes, my lord! I could not tell you: 70
I thrust away the thought, it drove me wild.
But listen to me now. I pray you, listen!

Osorio. Villain! no more! I'll hear no more of it.

Ferdinand. My lord! it much imports your future safety
That you should hear it.

Osorio (turning off from Ferdinand). Am I not a man? 75
'Tis as it should be! Tut&mdash;the deed itself
Was idle&mdash;and these after-pangs still idler!

Ferdinand. We met him in the very place you mention'd,
Hard by a grove of firs.

Osorio. Enough! enough!

Ferdinand. He fought us valiantly, and wounded all; 80
In fine, compell'd a parley!

Osorio (sighing as if lost in thought). Albert! Brother!

Ferdinand. He offer'd me his purse.

Osorio. Yes?

Ferdinand. Yes! I spurn'd it.
He promis'd us I know not what&mdash;in vain!
Then with a look and voice which overaw'd me,
He said&mdash;What mean you, friends? My life is dear. 85
I have a brother and a promised wife
Who make life dear to me, and if I fall
That brother will roam earth and hell for vengeance.
There was a likeness in his face to yours.
I ask'd his brother's name; he said, Osorio, 90
Son of Lord Velez! I had well-nigh fainted!
At length I said (if that indeed I said it,
And that no spirit made my tongue his organ),
That woman is now pregnant by that brother,
And he the man who sent us to destroy you, 95
[539]
He drove a thrust at me in rage. I told him,
He wore her portrait round his neck&mdash;he look'd
As he had been made of the rock that propp'd him back;
Ay, just as you look now&mdash;only less ghastly!
At last recovering from his trance, he threw 100
His sword away, and bade us take his life&mdash;
It was not worth his keeping.

Osorio. And you kill'd him?
O blood-hounds! may eternal wrath flame round you!
He was the image of the Deity. [A pause.
It seizes me&mdash;by Hell! I will go on! 105
What? would'st thou stop, man? thy pale looks won't save thee!
[Then suddenly pressing his forehead.
Oh! cold, cold, cold&mdash;shot thro' with icy cold!

Ferdinand (aside). Were he alive, he had return'd ere now.
The consequence the same, dead thro' his plotting!

Osorio. O this unutterable dying away here, 110
This sickness of the heart! [A pause.
What if I went
And liv'd in a hollow tomb, and fed on weeds?
Ay! that's the road to heaven! O fool! fool! fool! [A pause.
What have I done but that which nature destin'd
Or the blind elements stirr'd up within me? 115
If good were meant, why were we made these beings?
And if not meant&mdash;&mdash;

Ferdinand. How feel you now, my lord?


[Osorio starts, looks at him wildly, then, after a pause, during which
his features are forced into a smile.


Osorio. A gust of the soul! i'faith, it overset me.
O 'twas all folly&mdash;all! idle as laughter!
Now, Ferdinand, I swear that thou shalt aid me. 120

Ferdinand (in a low voice). I'll perish first! Shame on my coward heart,
That I must slink away from wickedness
Like a cow'd dog!

Osorio. What dost thou mutter of?


[540]


Ferdinand. Some of your servants know me, I am certain.

Osorio. There's some sense in that scruple; but we'll mask you. 125

Ferdinand. They'll know my gait. But stay! of late I have watch'd
A stranger that lives nigh, still picking weeds,
Now in the swamp, now on the walls of the ruin,
Now clamb'ring, like a runaway lunatic,
Up to the summit of our highest mount. 130
I have watch'd him at it morning-tide and noon,
Once in the moonlight. Then I stood so near,
I heard him mutt'ring o'er the plant. A wizard!
Some gaunt slave, prowling out for dark employments.

Osorio. What may his name be?

Ferdinand. That I cannot tell you. 135
Only Francesco bade an officer
Speak in your name, as lord of this domain.
So he was question'd, who and what he was.
This was his answer: Say to the Lord Osorio,
'He that can bring the dead to life again.' 140

Osorio. A strange reply!

Ferdinand. Aye&mdash;all of him is strange.
[541]
He call'd himself a Christian&mdash;yet he wears
The Moorish robe, as if he courted death.

Osorio. Where does this wizard live?

Ferdinand (pointing to a distance). You see that brooklet?
Trace its course backward thro' a narrow opening 145
It leads you to the place.

Osorio. How shall I know it?

Ferdinand. You can't mistake. It is a small green dale
Built all around with high off-sloping hills,
And from its shape our peasants aptly call it
The Giant's Cradle. There's a lake in the midst, 150
And round its banks tall wood, that branches over
And makes a kind of faery forest grow
Down in the water. At the further end
A puny cataract falls on the lake;
And there (a curious sight) you see its shadow 155
For ever curling, like a wreath of smoke,
Up through the foliage of those faery trees.
His cot stands opposite&mdash;you cannot miss it.
[542]Some three yards up the hill a mountain ash
Stretches its lower boughs and scarlet clusters 160
[543]
O'er the new thatch.

Osorio. I shall not fail to find it.


[Exit Osorio. Ferdinand goes into his house.


Scene changes.

The inside of a cottage, around which flowers and plants of various
kinds are seen.

Albert and Maurice.


Albert. He doth believe himself an iron soul,
And therefore puts he on an iron outward
And those same mock habiliments of strength
Hide his own weakness from himself.

Maurice. His weakness! 165
Come, come, speak out! Your brother is a villain!
Yet all the wealth, power, influence, which is yours
You suffer him to hold!

Albert. Maurice! dear Maurice!
That my return involved Osorio's death
I trust would give me an unmingl'd pang&mdash; 170
Yet bearable. But when I see my father
Strewing his scant grey hairs even on the ground
Which soon must be his grave; and my Maria,
Her husband proved a monster, and her infants
[544]
His infants&mdash;poor Maria!&mdash;all would perish, 175
All perish&mdash;all!&mdash;and I (nay bear with me!)
Could not survive the complicated ruin!

Maurice (much affected). Nay, now, if I have distress'd you&mdash;you well know,
I ne'er will quit your fortunes! true, 'tis tiresome.
You are a painter&mdash;one of many fancies&mdash; 180
You can call up past deeds, and make them live
On the blank canvas, and each little herb,
That grows on mountain bleak, or tangled forest,
You've learnt to name&mdash;but I&mdash;&mdash;

Albert. Well, to the Netherlands
We will return, the heroic Prince of Orange 185
Will grant us an asylum, in remembrance
Of our past service.

Maurice. Heard you not some steps?

Albert. What if it were my brother coming onward!
Not very wisely (but his creature teiz'd me)
I sent a most mysterious message to him. 190

Maurice. Would he not know you?

Albert. I unfearingly
Trust this disguise. Besides, he thinks me dead;
And what the mind believes impossible,
The bodily sense is slow to recognize.
Add too my youth, when last we saw each other; 195
Manhood has swell'd my chest, and taught my voice
A hoarser note.

Maurice. Most true! And Alva's Duke
Did not improve it by the unwholesome viands
He gave so scantily in that foul dungeon,
During our long imprisonment.


Enter Osorio.


Albert. It is he! 200

Maurice. Make yourself talk; you'll feel the less. Come, speak.
[545]
How do you find yourself? Speak to me, Albert.

Albert (placing his hand on his heart). A little fluttering here; but more of sorrow!

Osorio. You know my name, perhaps, better than me.
I am Osorio, son of the Lord Velez. 205

Albert (groaning aloud). The son of Velez!


[Osorio walks leisurely round the room, and looks attentively at the
plants.


Maurice. Why, what ails you now?


[Albert grasps Maurice's hand in agitation.


Maurice. How your hand trembles, Albert! Speak! what wish you?

Albert. To fall upon his neck and weep in anguish!

Osorio (returning). All very curious! from a ruin'd abbey
Pluck'd in the moonlight. There's a strange power in weeds 210
When a few odd prayers have been mutter'd o'er them.
Then they work miracles! I warrant you,
There's not a leaf, but underneath it lurks
Some serviceable imp. There's one of you,
Who sent me a strange message.

Albert. I am he! 215

Osorio. I will speak with you, and by yourself.


[Exit Maurice.


Osorio. 'He that can bring the dead to life again.'
Such was your message, Sir! You are no dullard,
But one that strips the outward rind of things!

Albert. 'Tis fabled there are fruits with tempting rinds 220
That are all dust and rottenness within.
Would'st thou I should strip such?

Osorio. Thou quibbling fool,
What dost thou mean? Think'st thou I journey'd hither
To sport with thee?

Albert. No, no! my lord! to sport
[546]
Best fits the gaiety of innocence! 225

Osorio (draws back as if stung and embarrassed, then folding his arms). O what a thing is Man! the wisest heart
A fool&mdash;a fool, that laughs at its own folly,
Yet still a fool! [Looks round the cottage.
It strikes me you are poor!

Albert. What follows thence?

Osorio. That you would fain be richer.
Besides, you do not love the rack, perhaps, 230
Nor a black dungeon, nor a fire of faggots.
The Inquisition&mdash;hey? You understand me,
And you are poor. Now I have wealth and power,
Can quench the flames, and cure your poverty.
And for this service, all I ask you is 235
That you should serve me&mdash;once&mdash;for a few hours.

Albert (solemnly). Thou art the son of Velez! Would to Heaven
That I could truly and for ever serve thee!

Osorio. The canting scoundrel softens. [Aside.
You are my friend!
'He that can bring the dead to life again.' 240
Nay, no defence to me. The holy brethren
Believe these calumnies. I know thee better.
[Then with great bitterness.
Thou art a man, and as a man I'll trust thee!

Albert. Alas, this hollow mirth! Declare your business!

Osorio. I love a lady, and she would love me 245
But for an idle and fantastic scruple.
Have you no servants round the house? no listeners?
[Osorio steps to the door.

Albert. What! faithless too? false to his angel wife?
To such a wife? Well might'st thou look so wan,
Ill-starr'd Maria! Wretch! my softer soul 250
Is pass'd away! and I will probe his conscience.


[547]


Osorio (returned). In truth this lady loved another man,
But he has perish'd.

Albert. What? you kill'd him? hey?

Osorio. I'll dash thee to the earth, if thou but think'st it,
Thou slave! thou galley-slave! thou mountebank! 255
I leave thee to the hangman!

Albert. Fare you well!
I pity you, Osorio! even to anguish!
[Albert retires off the stage.

Osorio (recovering himself). 'Twas ideotcy! I'll tie myself to an aspen,
And wear a Fool's Cap. Ho! [Calling after Albert.

Albert (returning). Be brief, what wish you?

Osorio. You are deep at bartering&mdash;you charge yourself 260
At a round sum. Come, come, I spake unwisely.

Albert. I listen to you.

Osorio. In a sudden tempest
Did Albert perish&mdash;he, I mean, the lover&mdash;
The fellow&mdash;&mdash;

Albert. Nay, speak out, 'twill ease your heart
To call him villain! Why stand'st thou aghast? 265
Men think it natural to hate their rivals!

Osorio (hesitating and half doubting whether he should proceed). Now till she knows him dead she will not wed me!

Albert (with eager vehemence). Are you not wedded, then? Merciful God!
Not wedded to Maria?

Osorio. Why, what ails thee?
Art mad or drunk? Why look'st thou upward so? 270
Dost pray to Lucifer, prince of the air?


[548]


Albert. Proceed. I shall be silent.
[Albert sits, and leaning on the table hides his face.

Osorio. To Maria!
Politic wizard! ere you sent that message,
You had conn'd your lesson, made yourself proficient
In all my fortunes! Hah! you prophesied 275
A golden crop!&mdash;well, you have not mistaken&mdash;
Be faithful to me, and I'll pay thee nobly.

Albert (lifting up his head). Well&mdash;and this lady!

Osorio. If we could make her certain of his death,
She needs must wed me. Ere her lover left her, 280
She tied a little portrait round his neck
Entreating him to wear it.

Albert (sighing). Yes! he did so!

Osorio. Why, no! he was afraid of accidents,
Of robberies and shipwrecks, and the like.
In secrecy he gave it me to keep 285
Till his return.

Albert. What, he was your friend then?

Osorio (wounded and embarrassed). I was his friend. [A pause.
Now that he gave it me
This lady knows not. You are a mighty wizard&mdash;
Can call this dead man up&mdash;he will not come&mdash; 290
He is in heaven then!&mdash;there you have no influence&mdash;
Still there are tokens; and your imps may bring you
Something he wore about him when he died.
And when the smoke of the incense on the altar
Is pass'd, your spirits will have left this picture. 295
What say you now?

Albert (after a long pause). Osorio, I will do it.

Osorio. Delays are dangerous. It shall be to-morrow
In the early evening. Ask for the Lord Velez.
I will prepare him. Music, too, and incense,
All shall be ready. Here is this same picture&mdash; 300
And here what you will value more, a purse.
Before the dusk&mdash;&mdash;

Albert. I will not fail to meet you.


[549]


Osorio. Till next we meet, farewell!

Albert (alone, gazes passionately at the portrait). And I did curse thee?
At midnight? on my knees? And I believed
Thee perjured, thee polluted, thee a murderess? 305
O blind and credulous fool! O guilt of folly!
Should not thy inarticulate fondnesses,
Thy infant loves&mdash;should not thy maiden vows,
Have come upon my heart? And this sweet image
Tied round my neck with many a chaste endearment 310
And thrilling hands, that made me weep and tremble.
Ah, coward dupe! to yield it to the miscreant
Who spake pollutions of thee!
I am unworthy of thy love, Maria!
Of that unearthly smile upon those lips, 315
Which ever smil'd on me! Yet do not scorn me.
I lisp'd thy name ere I had learnt my mother's!


Enter Maurice.


Albert. Maurice! that picture, which I painted for thee,
Of my assassination.

Maurice. I'll go fetch it.

Albert. Haste! for I yearn to tell thee what has pass'd. 320


[Maurice goes out.


Albert (gazing at the portrait). Dear image! rescued from a traitor's keeping,
I will not now prophane thee, holy image!
To a dark trick! That worst bad man shall find
A picture which shall wake the hell within him,
And rouse a fiery whirlwind in his conscience! 325

Ord. Here we may stop: your house distinct in view,
Yet we secured from listeners.

Fondly caressing him, her favour'd lover,
(By some base spell he had bewitched her senses.)
She whisper'd such dark fears of me forsooth,
As made this heart pour gall into my veins,
And as she coyly bound it round his neck,

Isidore. They'll know my gait: but stay! last night I watched
A stranger near the ruin in the wood,
Who as it seemed was gathering herbs and wild flowers.
I had followed him at distance, seen him scale
Its western wall, and by an easier entrance
Stole after him unnoticed. There I marked,
That mid the chequer work of light and shade,
With curious choice he plucked no other flowers,
But those on which the moonlight fell: and once
I heard him muttering o'er the plant. A wizard&mdash;
Some gaunt slave prowling here for dark employment.

Ordonio. Doubtless you question'd him?

Isidore. 'Twas my intention,
Having first traced him homeward to his haunt.
But lo! the stern Dominican, whose spies
Lurk everywhere, already (as it seemed)
Had given commission to his apt familiar
To seek and sound the Moor; who now returning,
Was by this trusty agent stopped midway.
I, dreading fresh suspicion if found near him
In that lone place, again concealed myself;
Yet within hearing. So the Moor was question'd,
And in your name, as lord of this domain,
Proudly he answered, 'Say to the Lord Ordonio,

[147] You cannot err. It is a small green dell Remorse.

Between 158 and 205:


Ordonio (in retiring stops suddenly at the edge of the scene, and then turning round to Isidore). Ha! Who lurks there! Have we been overheard?
There where the smooth high wall of slate-rock glitters&mdash;&mdash;

Isidore. 'Neath those tall stones, which propping each the other,
Form a mock portal with their pointed arch?
Pardon my smiles! 'Tis a poor idiot boy,
Who sits in the sun, and twirls a bough about,
His weak eyes seeth'd in most unmeaning tears.
And so he sits, swaying his cone-like head,
And, staring at his bough from morn to sun-set,
See-saws his voice in inarticulate noises.

Ordonio. 'Tis well! and now for this same wizard's lair.

Isidore. Some three strides up the hill, a mountain ash
Stretches its lower boughs and scarlet clusters
O'er the old thatch.

Ordonio. I shall not fail to find it.
[Exeunt Ordonio and Isidore.



Scene II.

The inside of a Cottage, around which flowers and plants of various
kinds are seen. Discovers Alvar, Zulimez and Alhadra, as on the point of
leaving.


Alhadra (addressing Alvar). Farewell then! and though many thoughts perplex me,
Aught evil or ignoble never can I
Suspect of thee! If what thou seem'st thou art,
The oppressed brethren of thy blood have need
Of such a leader.

Alvar. Nobly minded woman!
Long time against oppression have I fought,
And for the native liberty of faith
Have bled and suffered bonds. Of this be certain:
Time, as he courses onward, still unrolls
The volume of concealment. In the future,
As in the optician's glassy cylinder,
The indistinguishable blots and colours
Of the dim past collect and shape themselves,
Upstarting in their own completed image
To scare or to reward.
I sought the guilty,
And what I sought I found: but ere the spear
Flew from my hand, there rose an angel form
Betwixt me and my aim. With baffled purpose
To the Avenger I leave Vengeance, and depart!

Whate'er betide, if aught my arm may aid,
Or power protect, my word is pledged to thee:
For many are thy wrongs, and thy soul noble.
Once more, farewell. [Exit Alhadra.
Yes, to the Belgic states
We will return. These robes, this stained complexion,
Akin to falsehood, weigh upon my spirit.
Whate'er befall us, the heroic Maurice
Will grant us an asylum, in remembrance
Of our past services.

Zulimez. And all the wealth, power, influence which is yours,
You let a murderer hold?

Alvar. O faithful Zulimez!
That my return involved Ordonio's death,
I trust, would give me an unmingled pang,
Yet bearable:&mdash;but when I see my father
Strewing his scant grey hairs, e'en on the ground,
Which soon must be his grave, and my Teresa&mdash;
Her husband proved a murderer, and her infants
His infants&mdash;poor Teresa!&mdash;all would perish,
All perish&mdash;all; and I (nay bear with me)
Could not survive the complicated ruin!

Zulimez. Nay now! I have distress'd you&mdash;you well know,
I ne'er will quit your fortunes. True, 'tis tiresome:
You are a painter, one of many fancies!
You can call up past deeds, and make them live
On the blank canvass! and each little herb,
That grows on mountain bleak, or tangled forest,
You have learnt to name&mdash;
Hark! heard you not some footsteps?

Alvar. What if it were my brother coming onwards?
I sent a most mysterious message to him.


Enter Ordonio.


Alvar. It is he!

Ordonio (to himself as he enters). If I distinguished right her gait and stature,
It was the Moorish woman, Isidore's wife,
That passed me as I entered. A lit taper,
In the night air, doth not more naturally
Attract the night flies round it, than a conjuror
Draws round him the whole female neighbourhood.
[Addressing Alvar.
You know my name, I guess, if not my person.

[550]
ACT THE THIRD

Scene the First.&mdash;A hall of armory, with an altar in the part farthest
from the stage.

Velez, Osorio, Maria.


Maria. Lord Velez! you have ask'd my presence here,
And I submit; but (Heaven bear witness for me!)
My heart approves it not! 'tis mockery!


[Here Albert enters in a sorcerer's robe.


Maria (to Albert). Stranger! I mourn and blush to see you here
[551]On such employments! With far other thoughts 5
I left you.

Osorio (aside). Ha! he has been tampering with her!

Albert. O high-soul'd maiden, and more dear to me
Than suits the stranger's name, I swear to thee,
I will uncover all concealed things!
Doubt, but decide not!
Stand from off the altar. 10


[Here a strain of music is heard from behind the scenes, from an
instrument of glass or steel&mdash;the harmonica or Celestina stop, or
Clagget's metallic organ.


Albert. With no irreverent voice or uncouth charm
I call up the departed. Soul of Albert!
Hear our soft suit, and heed my milder spells:
So may the gates of Paradise unbarr'd
Cease thy swift toils, since haply thou art one 15
Of that innumerable company,
Who in broad circle, lovelier than the rainbow,
Girdle this round earth in a dizzy motion,
With noise too vast and constant to be heard&mdash;
Fitliest unheard! For, O ye numberless 20
And rapid travellers! what ear unstun'd,
What sense unmadden'd, might bear up against
The rushing of your congregated wings?
Even now your living wheel turns o'er my head!
Ye, as ye pass, toss high the desart sands, 25
That roar and whiten, like a burst of waters,
A sweet appearance, but a dread illusion,
To the parch'd caravan that roams by night.
And ye build up on the becalmed waves
That whirling pillar, which from earth to heaven 30
Stands vast, and moves in blackness. Ye too split
The ice-mount, and with fragments many and huge,
Tempest the new-thaw'd sea, whose sudden gulphs
Suck in, perchance, some Lapland wizard's skiff.
Then round and round the whirlpool's marge ye dance, 35
Till from the blue-swoln corse the soul toils out,
And joins your mighty army.
Soul of Albert!
[552]
Hear the mild spell and tempt no blacker charm.
By sighs unquiet and the sickly pang
Of an half dead yet still undying hope, 40
Pass visible before our mortal sense;
So shall the Church's cleansing rites be thine,
Her knells and masses that redeem the dead.




THE SONG


(Sung behind the scenes, accompanied by the same instrument as
before.)


Hear, sweet spirit! hear the spell
Lest a blacker charm compel! 45
So shall the midnight breezes swell
With thy deep long-lingering knell.
And at evening evermore
In a chapel on the shore
Shall the chanters sad and saintly, 50
Yellow tapers burning faintly,
Doleful masses chant for thee,
Miserere, Domine!

Hark! the cadence dies away
On the quiet moonlight sea, 55
The boatmen rest their oars, and say,
Miserere, Domine! [A long pause.



Osorio. This was too melancholy, father!

Velez. Nay!
My Albert lov'd sad music from a child.
Once he was lost; and after weary search 60
We found him in an open place of the wood,
To which spot he had follow'd a blind boy
Who breathed into a pipe of sycamore
Some strangely-moving notes, and these, he said,
Were taught him in a dream; him we first saw 65
Stretch'd on the broad top of a sunny heath-bank;
And, lower down, poor Albert fast asleep,
His head upon the blind boy's dog&mdash;it pleased me
To mark, how he had fasten'd round the pipe
A silver toy, his grandmother had given him. 70
[553]
Methinks I see him now, as he then look'd.
His infant dress was grown too short for him,
Yet still he wore it.

Albert (aside). My tears must not flow&mdash;
I must not clasp his knees, and cry, my father!

Osorio. The innocent obey nor charm nor spell. 75
My brother is in heaven. Thou sainted spirit
Burst on our sight, a passing visitant!
Once more to hear thy voice, once more to see thee,
O 'twere a joy to me.

Albert (abruptly). A joy to thee!
What if thou heard'st him now? What if his spirit 80
Re-enter'd its cold corse, and came upon thee,
With many a stab from many a murderer's poniard?
What if, his steadfast eye still beaming pity
And brother's love, he turn'd his head aside,
Lest he should look at thee, and with one look 85
Hurl thee beyond all power of penitence?

Velez. These are unholy fancies!

Osorio (struggling with his feelings). Yes, my father!
He is in heaven!

Albert (still to Osorio). But what if this same brother
Had lived even so, that at his dying hour
The name of heaven would have convuls'd his face 90
More than the death-pang?

Maria. Idly-prating man!
He was most virtuous.

Albert (still to Osorio). What if his very virtues
Had pamper'd his swoln heart, and made him proud?
And what if pride had duped him into guilt,
Yet still he stalk'd, a self-created God, 95
Not very bold, but excellently cunning;
And one that at his mother's looking-glass,
Would force his features to a frowning sternness?
Young lord! I tell thee, that there are such beings,&mdash;
[554]
Yea, and it gives fierce merriment to the damn'd, 100
To see these most proud men, that loathe mankind,
At every stir and buz of coward conscience,
Trick, cant, and lie, most whining hypocrites!
Away! away! Now let me hear more music.
[Music as before.

Albert. The spell is mutter'd&mdash;come, thou wandering shape, 105
Who own'st no master in an eye of flesh,
Whate'er be this man's doom, fair be it or foul,
If he be dead, come quick, and bring with thee
That which he grasp'd in death; and if he lives,
Some token of his obscure perilous life. 110
[The whole orchestra crashes into one chorus.

Wandering demon! hear the spell
Lest a blacker charm compel!


[A thunder-clap. The incense on the altar takes fire suddenly.


Maria. This is some trick&mdash;I know, it is a trick.
[555]
Yet my weak fancy, and these bodily creepings,
Would fain give substance to the shadow.[555:1]

Velez (advancing to the altar). Hah! 115
A picture!

Maria. O God! my picture?

Albert (gazing at Maria with wild impatient distressfulness).
Pale&mdash;pale&mdash;deadly pale!

Maria. He grasp'd it when he died.
[She swoons. Albert rushes to her and supports her.

Albert. My love! my wife!
Pale&mdash;pale, and cold! My love! my wife! Maria!


[Velez is at the altar. Osorio remains near him in a state of stupor.


Osorio (rousing himself). Where am I? 'Twas a lazy chilliness. 120

Velez (takes and conceals the picture in his robe). This way, my son! She must not see this picture.
Go, call the attendants! Life will soon ebb back!


[Velez and Osorio leave the stage.


Albert. Her pulse doth flutter. Maria! my Maria!

Maria (recovering&mdash;looks round). I heard a voice&mdash;but often in my dreams,
I hear that voice, and wake; and try, and try, 125
To hear it waking&mdash;but I never could!
And 'tis so now&mdash;even so! Well, he is dead,
Murder'd perhaps! and I am faint, and feel
As if it were no painful thing to die!

Albert (eagerly). Believe it not, sweet maid! believe it not, 130
Beloved woman! 'Twas a low imposture
Framed by a guilty wretch.

Maria. Ha! who art thou?

Albert (exceedingly agitated). My heart bursts over thee!

Maria. Didst thou murder him?
[556]
And dost thou now repent? Poor troubled man!
I do forgive thee, and may Heaven forgive thee! 135

Albert (aside). Let me be gone.

Maria. If thou didst murder him,
His spirit ever, at the throne of God,
Asks mercy for thee, prays for mercy for thee,
With tears in heaven!

Albert. Albert was not murder'd.
Your foster-mother&mdash;&mdash;

Maria. And doth she know aught? 140

Albert. She knows not aught&mdash;but haste thou to her cottage
To-morrow early&mdash;bring Lord Velez with thee.
There ye must meet me&mdash;but your servants come.

Maria (wildly). Nay&mdash;nay&mdash;but tell me!
[A pause&mdash;then presses her forehead.
Ah! 'tis lost again!
This dead confused pain! [A pause&mdash;she gazes at Albert.
Mysterious man! 145
Methinks, I cannot fear thee&mdash;for thine eye
Doth swim with pity&mdash;I will lean on thee.
[Exeunt Albert and Maria.


Re-enter Velez and Osorio.


Velez (sportively). You shall not see the picture, till you own it.[556:1]

Osorio. This mirth and raillery, sir! beseem your age.
I am content to be more serious.[556:2] 150


[557]


Velez. Do you think I did not scent it from the first?
An excellent scheme, and excellently managed.
'Twill blow away her doubts, and now she'll wed you,
I'faith, the likeness is most admirable.
I saw the trick&mdash;yet these old eyes grew dimmer 155
With very foolish tears, it look'd so like him!

Osorio. Where should I get her portrait?

Velez. Get her portrait?
Portrait? You mean the picture! At the painter's&mdash;
No difficulty then&mdash;but that you lit upon
A fellow that could play the sorcerer, 160
With such a grace and terrible majesty,
It was most rare good fortune. And how deeply
He seem'd to suffer when Maria swoon'd,
And half made love to her! I suppose you'll ask me
Why did he so?

Osorio (with deep tones of suppressed agitation). Ay, wherefore did he so? 165

Velez. Because you bade him&mdash;and an excellent thought!
A mighty man, and gentle as he is mighty.
He'll wind into her confidence, and rout
A host of scruples&mdash;come, confess, Osorio!

Osorio. You pierce through mysteries with a lynx's eye, 170
In this, your merry mood! you see it all!

Velez. Why, no!&mdash;not all. I have not yet discover'd,
At least, not wholly, what his speeches meant.
Pride and hypocrisy, and guilt and cunning&mdash;
Then when he fix'd his obstinate eye on you, 175
And you pretended to look strange and tremble.
Why&mdash;why&mdash;what ails you now?

Osorio (with a stupid stare). Me? why? what ails me?
A pricking of the blood&mdash;it might have happen'd
At any other time. Why scan you me?

Velez (clapping him on the shoulder). 'Twon't do&mdash;'twon't do&mdash;I have lived too long in the world. 180
His speech about the corse and stabs and murderers,
Had reference to the assassins in the picture:
That I made out.

Osorio (with a frantic eagerness). Assassins! what assassins!

Velez. Well-acted, on my life! Your curiosity
Runs open-mouth'd, ravenous as winter wolf. 185
I dare not stand in its way.
[He shows Osorio the picture.

Osorio. Dup'd&mdash;dup'd&mdash;dup'd!
[558]
That villain Ferdinand! (aside).

Velez. Dup'd&mdash;dup'd&mdash;not I.
As he swept by me&mdash;&mdash;

Osorio. Ha! what did he say?

Velez. He caught his garment up and hid his face.
It seem'd as he were struggling to suppress&mdash;&mdash; 190

Osorio. A laugh! a laugh! O hell! he laughs at me!

Velez. It heaved his chest more like a violent sob.

Osorio. A choking laugh!
[A pause&mdash;then very wildly.
I tell thee, my dear father!
I am most glad of this!

Velez. Glad!&mdash;aye&mdash;to be sure.

Osorio. I was benumb'd, and stagger'd up and down 195
Thro' darkness without light&mdash;dark&mdash;dark&mdash;dark&mdash;
And every inch of this my flesh did feel
As if a cold toad touch'd it! Now 'tis sunshine,
And the blood dances freely thro' its channels!
[He turns off&mdash;then (to himself) mimicking Ferdinand's manner.[558:1]
'A common trick of gratitude, my lord! 200
Old Gratitude! a dagger would dissect
His own full heart,' 'twere good to see its colour!

Velez (looking intently at the picture). Calm, yet commanding! how he bares his breast,
Yet still they stand with dim uncertain looks,
As penitence had run before their crime. 205
A crime too black for aught to follow it
Save blasphemous despair! See this man's face&mdash;
With what a difficult toil he drags his soul
To do the deed. [Then to Osorio.
O this was delicate flattery
To poor Maria, and I love thee for it! 210

Osorio (in a slow voice with a reasoning laugh). Love&mdash;love&mdash;and then we hate&mdash;and what? and wherefore?
Hatred and love. Strange things! both strange alike!
What if one reptile sting another reptile,
Where is the crime? The goodly face of Nature
Hath one trail less of slimy filth upon it. 215
[559]
Are we not all predestined rottenness
And cold dishonor? Grant it that this hand
Had given a morsel to the hungry worms
Somewhat too early. Where's the guilt of this?
That this must needs bring on the idiotcy 220
Of moist-eyed penitence&mdash;'tis like a dream!

Velez. Wild talk, my child! but thy excess of feeling
[Turns off from Osorio.
Sometimes, I fear, it will unhinge his brain!

Osorio. I kill a man and lay him in the sun,
And in a month there swarm from his dead body 225
A thousand&mdash;nay, ten thousand sentient beings
In place of that one man whom I had kill'd.
Now who shall tell me, that each one and all,
Of these ten thousand lives, is not as happy
As that one life, which being shov'd aside 230
Made room for these ten thousand?[559:1]

Velez. Wild as madness!

Osorio. Come, father! you have taught me to be merry,
And merrily we'll pore upon this picture.

Velez (holding the picture before Osorio). That Moor, who points his sword at Albert's breast&mdash;&mdash;

Osorio (abruptly). A tender-hearted, scrupulous, grateful villain, 235
Whom I will strangle!

Velez. And these other two&mdash;&mdash;

Osorio. Dead&mdash;dead already!&mdash;what care I for the dead?

Velez. The heat of brain and your too strong affection
For Albert, fighting with your other passion,
Unsettle you, and give reality 240
To these your own contrivings.

Osorio. Is it so?
You see through all things with your penetration.
[560]
Now I am calm. How fares it with Maria?
My heart doth ache to see her.

Velez. Nay&mdash;defer it!
Defer it, dear Osorio! I will go. [Exit Velez. 245

Osorio. A rim of the sun lies yet upon the sea&mdash;
And now 'tis gone! all may be done this night!


Enter a Servant.


Osorio. There is a man, once a Moresco chieftain,
One Ferdinand.

Servant. He lives in the Alpuxarras,
Beneath a slate rock.

Osorio. Slate rock?

Servant. Yes, my lord! 250
If you had seen it, you must have remember'd
The flight of steps his children had worn up it
With often clambering.

Osorio. Well, it may be so.

Servant. Why, now I think on't, at this time of the year
'Tis hid by vines.

Osorio (in a muttering voice). The cavern&mdash;aye&mdash;the cavern.
He cannot fail to find it. [To the Servant. 255
Where art going?
You must deliver to this Ferdinand
A letter. Stay till I have written it. [Exit the Servant.

Osorio (alone). The tongue can't stir when the mouth is fill'd with mould.
A little earth stops up most eloquent mouths, 260
And a square stone with a few pious texts
Cut neatly on it, keeps the earth down tight.


Scene changes to the space before the castle.

Francesco and a Spy.


Francesco. Yes! yes! I have the key of all their lives.
If a man fears me, he is forced to love me.
And if I can, and do not ruin him, 265
He is fast bound to serve and honour me!


[Albert enters from the castle, and is crossing the stage.


Spy. There&mdash;there&mdash;your Reverence! That is the sorcerer.


[Francesco runs up and rudely catches hold of Albert. Albert dashes him
to the earth. Francesco and the Spy make an uproar, and the servants
rush from out the castle.


[561]


Francesco. Seize, seize and gag him! or the Church curses you!


[The servants seize and gag Albert.

Enter Velez and Osorio.


Osorio (aside). This is most lucky!

Francesco (inarticulate with rage). See you this, Lord Velez?
Good evidence have I of most foul sorcery, 270
And in the name of Holy Church command you
To give me up the keys&mdash;the keys, my lord!
Of that same dungeon-hole beneath your castle.
This imp of hell&mdash;but we delay enquiry
Till to Granada we have convoy'd him. 275

Osorio (to the Servants). Why haste you not? Go, fly and dungeon him!
Then bring the keys and give them to his Reverence.


[The Servants hurry off Albert. Osorio goes up to Francesco, and
pointing at Albert.


Osorio (with a laugh). 'He that can bring the dead to life again.'

Francesco. What? did you hear it?

Osorio. Yes, and plann'd this scheme
To bring conviction on him. Ho! a wizard, 280
Thought I&mdash;but where's the proof! I plann'd this scheme.
The scheme has answer'd&mdash;we have proof enough.

Francesco. My lord, your pious policy astounds me.
I trust my honest zeal&mdash;&mdash;

Osorio. Nay, reverend father!
It has but raised my veneration for you. 285
But 'twould be well to stop all intertalk
Between my servants and this child of darkness.

Francesco. My lord! with speed I'll go, make swift return,
And humbly redeliver you the keys.
[Exit Francesco.

Osorio (alone). 'The stranger, that lives nigh, still picking weeds.' 290
And this was his friend, his crony, his twin-brother!
O! I am green, a very simple stripling&mdash;
The wise men of this world make nothing of me.
By Heaven, 'twas well contrived! And I, forsooth,
I was to cut my throat in honour of conscience. 295
And this tall wizard&mdash;ho!&mdash;he was to pass
For Albert's friend! He hath a trick of his manner.
He was to tune his voice to honey'd sadness,
[562]
And win her to a transfer of her love
By lamentable tales of her dear Albert, 300
And his dear Albert! Yea, she would have lov'd him.
He, that can sigh out in a woman's ear
Sad recollections of her perish'd lover,
And sob and smile with veering sympathy,
And, now and then, as if by accident, 305
Pass his mouth close enough to touch her cheek
With timid lip, he takes the lover's place,
He takes his place, for certain! Dusky rogue,
Were it not sport to whimper with thy mistress,
Then steal away and roll upon my grave, 310
Till thy sides shook with laughter? Blood! blood! blood!
They want thy blood! thy blood, Osorio!


[END OF ACT THE THIRD.]



FOOTNOTES:

[555:1] In MS. II this speech is crossed out, and on the blank
page opposite the following is written in Coleridge's hand:&mdash;

'Instead of Maria's portrait, Albert places on the altar a small picture
of his attempted assassination. The scene is not wholly without
poetical merit, but it is miserably undramatic, or rather untragic. A
scene of magic is introduced in which no single person on the stage has
the least faith&mdash;all, though in different ways, think or know it to be a
trick&mdash;&mdash;consequently, &amp;c.' P. W., 1893, p. 494, Editor's Note.

In MS. III the following stage-direction is written (in S. T. C.'s
handwriting) on the page opposite to lines 113-15:&mdash;

'Albert has placed on the altar a small picture representing the attempt
to assassinate him, instead of the portrait of Maria which Osorio had
given him.'

[556:1] In MS. II Coleridge has written opposite this:&mdash;'Velez
supposes the picture is an innocent contrivance of Osorio's to remove
Maria's scruples: Osorio, that it is the portrait of Maria which he had
himself given the supposed Wizard.' P. W., 1893, p. 495, Editors
Note.

In MS. III Coleridge wrote on the opposite page:&mdash;'Velez supposes the
picture which represents the attempt to assassinate Albert, to have been
a mere invention contrived by Osorio with the most innocent intentions.
Osorio supposes it of course, to be the portrait of Maria which he had
restored to Albert!'

[556:2] The transcriber of MS. I had here written
'superstitious', which is marked through with ink, and 'serious' is
substituted, in Coleridge's own hand. In MS. II 'superstitious' is left
undisturbed. P. W., 1893, p. 495, Editor's Note. In MS. III
'serious' is erased and 'superstitious' is superscribed.

[558:1] In MS. II Coleridge has written opposite this:&mdash;'Osorio
immediately supposes that this wizard whom Ferdinand had recommended to
him, was in truth, an accomplice of Ferdinand, to whom the whole secret
had been betrayed.' P. W., 1893, p. 496, Editor's Note.

[559:1] Opposite the passage in MS. II the following is written
in the transcriber's hand:&mdash;


Ce malheur, dites-vous, est le bien d'un autre &ecirc;tre&mdash;
De mon corps tout sanglant, mille insectes vont na&icirc;tre.
Quand la mort met le comble aux maux que j'ai souffert,
Le beau soulagement d'&ecirc;tre mang&eacute; de vers!
Je ne suis du grand tout qu'une faible partie&mdash;
Oui; mais les animaux condamn&eacute;s &agrave; la vie
Sous les &ecirc;tres sentants n&eacute;s sous la m&egrave;me loi
Vivent dans la douleur, et meurent comme moi.


D&eacute;sastre de Lisbonne. P. W., 1893, p. 491, Editor's Note.

ACT III.

Scene 1.&mdash;A Hall of armory, with an altar at the back of the stage.
Soft music from an instrument of glass or steel. Valdez, Ordonio, and
Alvar in a Sorcerer's robe, are discovered.



  Ord. This was too melancholy, father.

&nbsp;

  Val. Nay,
    My Alvar lov'd sad music from a child.
    Once he was lost; and after weary search
    We found him in an open place in [of Osor.] the wood,
    To which spot he had followed a blind boy,
    Who breath'd into a pipe of sycamore
    Some strangely-moving notes: and these, he said,
    Were taught him in a dream. Him we first saw
    Stretch'd on the broad top of a sunny heath-bank;
    And lower down poor Alvar, fast asleep,
    His head upon the blind boy's dog. It pleas'd me
    To mark how he had fasten'd round the pipe

          &nbsp;
      
    
  
  His infant dress was grown too short for him, Osor.
    Even so!&mdash;He had outgrown his infant dress,


  Yet still he wore it.

&nbsp;

  Alv. (aside). My tears must not flow!
    I must not clasp his knees, and cry, My father!

remainder of Act III of Osorio was rewritten, much was omitted, much
added, and the 'dramatic ordonnance' of this part of the play was
remodelled on a different plan, but the following lines 174-82, 195-202,

ACT THE FOURTH

Scene the First.&mdash;A cavern, dark except where a gleam of moonlight is
seen on one side of the further end of it, supposed to be cast on it
from a cranny [crevice Remorse] in a part of the cavern out of
sight.

[Ferdinand alone, an extinguished torch in his hand.


Ferdinand. Drip! drip! drip! drip!&mdash;in such a place as this
It has nothing else to do but drip! drip! drip!
I wish it had not dripp'd upon my torch.
Faith 'twas a moving letter&mdash;very moving!
His life in danger&mdash;no place safe but this. 5
'Twas his turn now to talk of gratitude!
And yet&mdash;but no! there can't be such a villain.
It cannot be!
Thanks to that little cranny
[563]
Which lets the moonlight in! I'll go and sit by it.
To peep at a tree, or see a he-goat's beard, 10
Or hear a cow or two breathe loud in their sleep,
'Twere better than this dreary noise of water-drops!


[He goes out of sight, opposite to the patch of moonlight, [and
returns. Remorse] returns after a minute's elapse in an ecstasy of
fear.


A hellish pit! O God&mdash;'tis like my night-mair!
I was just in!&mdash;and those damn'd fingers of ice
Which clutch'd my hair up! Ha! what's that? it moved! 15


[Ferdinand stands [motionless MS. III erased] staring at another
recess in the cavern. In the mean time Osorio enters with a torch and
hollas to him [halloes to Isidore Remorse].


Ferdinand. I swear, I saw a something moving there!
The moonshine came and went, like a flash of lightning.
I swear, I saw it move!


[Osorio goes into the recess, then returns, and with great scorn.


Osorio. A jutting clay-stone
Drips on the long lank weed that grows beneath;
[564]
And the weed nods and drips.

Ferdinand (forcing a faint laugh). A joke to laugh at! 20
It was not that which frighten'd me, my lord!

Osorio. What frighten'd you?

Ferdinand. You see that little cranny?
But first permit me,
[Lights his torch at Osorio's, and while lighting it.
(A lighted torch in the hand
Is no unpleasant object here&mdash;one's breath
Floats round the flame, and makes as many colours 25
As the thin clouds that travel near the moon.)[564:1]
You see that cranny there?

Osorio. Well, what of that?

Ferdinand. I walk'd up to it, meaning to sit there.
[565]
When I had reach'd it within twenty paces&mdash;&mdash;
[Ferdinand starts as if he felt the terror over again.
Merciful Heaven! Do go, my lord! and look. 30


[Osorio goes and returns.


Osorio. It must have shot some pleasant feelings thro' you?

Ferdinand. If every atom of a dead man's flesh
Should move, each one with a particular life,
Yet all as cold as ever&mdash;'twas just so!
Or if it drizzled needle-points of frost 35
Upon a feverish head made suddenly bald&mdash;

Osorio (interrupting him). Why, Ferdinand! I blush for thy cowardice.
It would have startled any man, I grant thee.
But such a panic.

Ferdinand. When a boy, my lord!
I could have sat whole hours beside that chasm, 40
Push'd in huge stones and heard them thump and rattle
Against its horrid sides; and hung my head
Low down, and listen'd till the heavy fragments
Sunk, with faint crash, in that still groaning well,
Which never thirsty pilgrim blest, which never 45
A living thing came near; unless, perchance,
Some blind-worm battens on the ropy mould,
Close at its edge.

Osorio. Art thou more coward now?

Ferdinand. Call him that fears his fellow-men a coward.
I fear not man. But this inhuman cavern 50
It were too bad a prison-house for goblins.
Besides (you'll laugh, my lord!) but true it is,
My last night's sleep was very sorely haunted[565:1]
[566]
By what had pass'd between us in the morning.
I saw you in a thousand hideous ways, 55
And doz'd and started, doz'd again and started.
I do entreat your lordship to believe me,
In my last dream&mdash;&mdash;

Osorio. Well?

Ferdinand. I was in the act
Of falling down that chasm, when Alhadra
Waked me. She heard my heart beat!

Osorio. Strange enough! 60
Had you been here before?

Ferdinand. Never, my lord!
But my eyes do not see it now more clearly
Than in my dream I saw that very chasm.


[Osorio stands in a deep study&mdash;then, after a pause.


Osorio. There is no reason why it should be so.
And yet it is.

Ferdinand. What is, my lord?

Osorio. Unpleasant 65
To kill a man!

Ferdinand. Except in self-defence.


[567]


Osorio. Why that's my case: and yet 'tis still unpleasant.
At least I find it so! But you, perhaps,
Have stronger nerves?

Ferdinand. Something doth trouble you.
How can I serve you? By the life you gave me, 70
By all that makes that life of value to me,
My wife, my babes, my honour, I swear to you,
Name it, and I will toil to do the thing,
If it be innocent! But this, my lord!
Is not a place where you could perpetrate, 75
No, nor propose a wicked thing. The darkness
(When ten yards off, we know, 'tis chearful moonlight)
Collects the guilt and crowds it round the heart.
It must be innocent.

Osorio. Thyself be judge.
[Osorio walks round the cavern&mdash;then looking round it.
One of our family knew this place well. 80

Ferdinand. Who? when? my lord.

Osorio. What boots it who or when?
Hang up the torch. I'll tell his tale to thee.


[They hang [up] their torches in some shelf of [on some ridge in
Remorse] the cavern.


Osorio. He was a man different from other men,
And he despised them, yet revered himself.[567:1]

Ferdinand. What? he was mad?

Osorio. All men seem'd mad to him, 85
[568]
Their actions noisome folly, and their talk&mdash;
A goose's gabble was more musical.
Nature had made him for some other planet,
And press'd his soul into a human shape
By accident or malice. In this world 90
He found no fit companion!

Ferdinand. Ah, poor wretch!
Madmen are mostly proud.

Osorio. He walk'd alone,
And phantasies, unsought for, troubled him.
Something within would still be shadowing out
All possibilities, and with these shadows 95
His mind held dalliance. Once, as so it happen'd,
A fancy cross'd him wilder than the rest:
To this in moody murmur, and low voice,
He yielded utterance as some talk in sleep.
The man who heard him&mdash;&mdash;
Why didst thou look round? 100

Ferdinand. I have a prattler three years old, my lord!
In truth he is my darling. As I went
From forth my door, he made a moan in sleep&mdash;
But I am talking idly&mdash;pray go on!
And what did this man?

Osorio. With his human hand 105
He gave a being and reality
To that wild fancy of a possible thing.
Well it was done. [Then very wildly.
Why babblest thou of guilt?
The deed was done, and it pass'd fairly off.
And he, whose tale I tell thee&mdash;dost thou listen? 110

Ferdinand. I would, my lord, you were by my fireside!
I'd listen to you with an eager eye,
Tho' you began this cloudy tale at midnight.
But I do listen&mdash;pray proceed, my lord!

Osorio. Where was I?

Ferdinand. He of whom you tell the tale&mdash; 115

Osorio. Surveying all things with a quiet scorn
[569]
Tamed himself down to living purposes,
The occupations and the semblances
Of ordinary men&mdash;and such he seem'd.
But that some over-ready agent&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash; 120

Ferdinand. Ah! what of him, my lord?

Osorio. He proved a villain;
Betray'd the mystery to a brother villain;
And they between them hatch'd a damn&eacute;d plot
To hunt him down to infamy and death
To share the wealth of a most noble family, 125
And stain the honour of an orphan lady
With barbarous mixture and unnatural union.
What did the Velez? I am proud of the name,
Since he dared do it.


[Osorio grasps his sword and turns off from Ferdinand, then, after a
pause, returns.


Osorio. Our links burn dimly.

Ferdinand. A dark tale darkly finish'd! Nay, my lord! 130
Tell what he did.

Osorio (fiercely). That which his wisdom prompted.
He made the traitor meet him in this cavern,
And here he kill'd the traitor.

Ferdinand. No!&mdash;the fool.
He had not wit enough to be a traitor.
Poor thick-eyed beetle! not to have foreseen 135
That he, who gull'd thee with a whimper'd lie
To murder his own brother, would not scruple
To murder thee, if e'er his guilt grew jealous
And he could steal upon thee in the dark!

Osorio. Thou would'st not then have come, if&mdash;&mdash;

Ferdinand. O yes, my lord! 140
I would have met him arm'd, and scared the coward!


[Ferdinand throws off his robe, shows himself armed, and draws his
sword.


Osorio. Now this is excellent, and warms the blood!
My heart was drawing back, drawing me back
[570]
With womanish pulls of pity. Dusky slave,
Now I will kill thee pleasantly, and count it 145
Among my comfortable thoughts hereafter.

Ferdinand. And all my little ones fatherless! Die thou first.


[They fight. Osorio disarms Ferdinand, and in disarming him, throws his
sword up that recess, opposite to which they were standing.


Ferdinand (springing wildly towards Osorio). Still I can strangle thee!

Osorio. Nay, fool! stand off.
I'll kill thee&mdash;but not so! Go fetch thy sword.


[Ferdinand hurries into the recess with his torch. Osorio follows him,
and in a moment returns alone.


Osorio. Now&mdash;this was luck! No bloodstains, no dead body! 150
His dream, too, is made out. Now for his friend.[570:1]      [Exit.


[571]
Scene changes to the court before the Castle
of Velez.

Maria and her Foster-Mother.


Maria. And when I heard that you desired to see me,
I thought your business was to tell me of him.

Foster-Mother. I never saw the Moor, whom you describe.

Maria. 'Tis strange! he spake of you familiarly 155
[572]
As mine and Albert's common foster-mother.

Foster-Mother. Now blessings on the man, whoe'er he be,
That join'd your names with mine! O my sweet lady,
As often as I think of those dear times
When you two little ones would stand at eve, 160
On each side of my chair, and make me learn
All you had learnt in the day; and how to talk
In gentle phrase, then bid me sing to you,
'Tis more like heaven to come, that what has been!

Maria. O my dear mother! this strange man has left me 165
Wilder'd with wilder fancies than yon moon
Breeds in the love-sick maid&mdash;who gazes at it
Till lost in inward vision, with wet eye
She gazes idly! But that entrance, mother!

Foster-Mother. Can no one hear? It is a perilous tale! 170

Maria. No one.

Foster-Mother. My husband's father told it me,
Poor old Leoni. Angels rest his soul!
He was a woodman, and could fell and saw
With lusty arm. You know that huge round beam
Which props the hanging wall of the old chapel? 175
Beneath that tree, while yet it was a tree,
He found a baby wrapt in mosses, lined
With thistle-beards, and such small locks of wool
As hang on brambles. Well, he brought him home,
And rear'd him at the then Lord Velez' cost. 180
And so the babe grew up a pretty boy.
A pretty boy, but most unteachable&mdash;
And never learnt a prayer, nor told a bead,
But knew the names of birds, and mock'd their notes,
And whistled, as he were a bird himself. 185
And all the autumn 'twas his only play
To get the seeds of wild flowers, and to plant them
With earth and water on the stumps of trees.
A friar who gather'd simples in the wood,
A grey-hair'd man&mdash;he loved this little boy, 190
[573]
The boy loved him&mdash;and, when the friar taught him,
He soon could write with the pen; and from that time
Lived chiefly at the convent or the castle.
So he became a very learned youth.
But O! poor wretch&mdash;he read, and read, and read, 195
Till his brain turn'd&mdash;and ere his twentieth year,
He had unlawful thoughts of many things.
And though he pray'd, he never loved to pray
With holy men, nor in a holy place.
But yet his speech, it was so soft and sweet, 200
The late Lord Velez ne'er was wearied with him,
And once as by the north side of the chapel
They stood together, chain'd in deep discourse,
The earth heav'd under them with such a groan,
That the wall totter'd, and had well-nigh fall'n 205
Right on their heads. My lord was sorely frighten'd;
A fever seiz'd him; and he made confession
Of all the heretical and lawless talk
Which brought this judgment: so the youth was seiz'd
And cast into that hole. My husband's father 210
Sobb'd like a child&mdash;it almost broke his heart.
And once as he was working in the cellar,
He heard a voice distinctly; 'twas the youth's,
Who sung a doleful song about green fields,
How sweet it were on lake or wild savannah 215
To hunt for food, and be a naked man,
And wander up and down at liberty.
He always doted on the youth, and now
His love grew desperate; and defying death,
He made that cunning entrance I described: 220
And the young man escaped.

Maria. 'Tis a sweet tale:
Such as would lull a list'ning child to sleep,
His rosy face besoil'd with unwiped tears.
And what became of him?

Foster-Mother. He went on shipboard
With those bold voyagers, who made discovery 225
Of golden lands; Leoni's younger brother
Went likewise, and when he return'd to Spain,
He told Leoni that the poor mad youth,
[574]
Soon after they arrived in that new world,
In spite of his dissuasion seized a boat, 230
And all alone set sail by silent moonlight,
Up a great river, great as any sea,
And ne'er was heard of more; but 'tis supposed
He liv'd and died among the savage men.


Enter Velez.


Velez. Still sad, Maria? This same wizard haunts you. 235

Maria. O Christ! the tortures that hang o'er his head,
If ye betray him to these holy brethren!

Velez (with a kind of sneer). A portly man, and eloquent, and tender!
In truth, I shall not wonder if you mourn
That their rude grasp should seize on such a victim. 240

Maria. The horror of their ghastly punishments
Doth so o'ertop the height of sympathy,
That I should feel too little for mine enemy&mdash;
Ah! far too little&mdash;if 'twere possible,
I could feel more, even tho' my child or husband 245
Were doom'd to suffer them! That such things are&mdash;&mdash;

Velez. Hush! thoughtless woman!

Maria. Nay&mdash;it wakes within me
More than a woman's spirit.

Velez (angrily). No more of this&mdash;
I can endure no more.

Foster-Mother. My honour'd master!
Lord Albert used to talk so.

Maria. Yes! my mother! 250
These are my Albert's lessons, and I con them
With more delight than, in my fondest hour,
I bend me o'er his portrait.

Velez (to the Foster-Mother). My good woman,
You may retire.
[Exit the Foster-Mother.
Velez. We have mourn'd for Albert.
[575]
Have I no living son?

Maria. Speak not of him! 255
That low imposture&mdash;my heart sickens at it,
If it be madness, must I wed a madman?
And if not madness, there is mystery,
And guilt doth lurk behind it!

Valdez. Is this well?

Maria. Yes! it is truth. Saw you his countenance? 260
How rage, remorse, and scorn, and stupid fear,
Displac'd each other with swift interchanges?
If this were all assumed, as you believe,
He must needs be a most consummate actor;
And hath so vast a power to deceive me, 265
I never could be safe. And why assume
The semblance of such execrable feelings?

Velez. Ungrateful woman! I have tried to stifle
An old man's passion! Was it not enough
That thou hast made my son a restless man, 270
[576]
Banish'd his health and half-unhinged his reason,
But that thou wilt insult him with suspicion,
And toil to blast his honour? I am old&mdash;
A comfortless old man! Thou shalt not stay
Beneath my roof!


[Francesco enters and stands listening.


Velez. Repent and marry him&mdash; 275
Or to the convent.

Francesco (muttering). Good! good! very good!

Maria. Nay, grant me some small pittance of my fortune,
And I will live a solitary woman,
Or my poor foster-mother and her grandsons
May be my household.

Francesco (advancing). I abhor a listener; 280
But you spoke so, I could not choose but hear you.
I pray, my lord! will you embolden me
To ask you why this lady doth prefer
To live in lonely sort, without a friend
Or fit companion?

Velez. Bid her answer you. 285

Maria. Nature will be my friend and fit companion.
[Turns off from them.
[577]
O Albert! Albert! that they could return,
Those blessed days, that imitated heaven!
When we two wont to walk at evening-tide;
When we saw nought but beauty; when we heard 290
The voice of that Almighty One, who lov'd us,
In every gale that breath'd, and wave that murmur'd!
O we have listen'd, even till high-wrought pleasure
Hath half-assumed the countenance of grief,
And the deep sigh seem'd to heave up a weight 295
Of bliss, that press'd too heavy on the heart.


[578]


Francesco. But in the convent, lady, you would have
Such aids as might preserve you from perdition.
There you might dwell.

Maria. With tame and credulous faith,
Mad melancholy, antic merriment, 300
Leanness, disquietude, and secret pangs!
O God! it is a horrid thing to know
That each pale wretch, who sits and drops her beads
Had once a mind, which might have given her wings
Such as the angels wear!

Francesco (stifling his rage). Where is your son, my lord? 305

Velez. I have not seen him, father, since he left you.

Francesco. His lordship's generous nature hath deceiv'd him!
That Ferdinand (or if not he his wife)
I have fresh evidence&mdash;are infidels.
We are not safe until they are rooted out. 310

Maria. Thou man, who call'st thyself the minister
Of Him whose law was love unutterable!
Why is thy soul so parch'd with cruelty,
That still thou thirstest for thy brother's blood?

Velez (rapidly). Father! I have long suspected it&mdash;her brain&mdash; 315
Heed it not, father!

Francesco. Nay&mdash;but I must heed it.

Maria. Thou miserable man! I fear thee not,
Nor prize a life which soon may weary me.
Bear witness, Heav'n! I neither scorn nor hate him&mdash; 320
But O! 'tis wearisome to mourn for evils,
Still mourn, and have no power to remedy! [Exit Maria.

Francesco. My lord! I shall presume to wait on you
To-morrow early.

Velez. Be it so, good father! [Exit Francesco.

Velez (alone). I do want solace, but not such as thine! 325
The moon is high in heaven, and my eyes ache,
But not with sleep. Well&mdash;it is ever so.
A child, a child is born! and the fond heart
Dances! and yet the childless are most happy.



[579]

[Scene changes to the mountains by moonlight. Alhadra alone in a
Moorish dress, her eyes fixed on the earth. Then drop in one after
another, from different parts of the stage, a considerable number of
Morescoes, all in their Moorish garments. They form a circle at a
distance round Alhadra. After a pause one of the Morescoes to the man
who stands next to him.


First Moresco. The law which forced these Christian dresses on us, 330
'Twere pleasant to cleave down the wretch who framed it.

Second. Yet 'tis not well to trample on it idly.

First. Our country robes are dear.

Second. And like dear friends,
May chance to prove most perilous informers.


[A third Moresco, Naomi, advances from out the circle.


Naomi. Woman! may Alla and the prophet bless thee! 335
We have obey'd thy call. Where is our chief?
And why didst thou enjoin the Moorish garments?

Alhadra (lifting up [raising Remorse] her eyes, and looking round on the circle).
Warriors of Mahomet, faithful in the battle,
My countrymen! Come ye prepared to work
An honourable deed? And would ye work it 340
In the slave's garb? Curse on those Christian robes!
They are spell-blasted; and whoever wears them,
His arm shrinks wither'd, his heart melts away,
And his bones soften!

Naomi. Where is Ferdinand?

Alhadra (in a deep low voice). This night I went from forth my house, and left 345
His children all asleep; and he was living!
And I return'd, and found them still asleep&mdash;
But he had perish'd.

All. Perished?

Alhadra. He had perish'd!
Sleep on, poor babes! not one of you doth know
That he is fatherless, a desolate orphan! 350
Why should we wake them? Can an infant's arm
[580]
Revenge his murder?

One to Another. Did she say his murder?

Naomi. Murder'd? Not murder'd?

Alhadra. Murder'd by a Christian!


[They all, at once, draw their sabres.


Alhadra (to Naomi, who on being addressed again advances from the circle). Brother of Zagri! fling away thy sword:
This is thy chieftain's!
[He steps forward to take it.
Dost thou dare receive it? 355
For I have sworn by Alia and the prophet,
No tear shall dim these eyes, this woman's heart
Shall heave no groan, till I have seen that sword
Wet with the blood of all the house of Velez!


Enter Maurice.


All. A spy! a spy! [They seize him.

Maurice. Off! off! unhand me, slaves! 360


[After much struggling he disengages himself and draws his sword.


Naomi (to Alhadra). Speak! shall we kill him?

Maurice. Yes! ye can kill a man,
Some twenty of you! But ye are Spanish slaves!
And slaves are always cruel, always cowards.

Alhadra. That man has spoken truth. Whence and who art thou?

Maurice. I seek a dear friend, whom for aught I know 365
The son of Velez hath hired one of you
To murder! Say, do ye know aught of Albert?

Alhadra (starting). Albert?&mdash;three years ago I heard that name
Murmur'd in sleep! High-minded foreigner!
Mix thy revenge with mine, and stand among us. 370


[Maurice stands among the Morescoes.


Alhadra. Was not Osorio my husband's friend?

Old Man. He kill'd my son in battle; yet our chieftain
Forced me to sheathe my dagger. See&mdash;the point
Is bright, unrusted with the villain's blood!

Alhadra. He is your chieftain's murderer!


[581]


Naomi. He dies by Alla!

All (dropping on one knee). By Alla! 375

Alhadra. This night a reeking slave came with loud pant,
Gave Ferdinand a letter, and departed,
Swift as he came. Pale, with unquiet looks,
He read the scroll.

Maurice. Its purport?

Alhadra. Yes, I ask'd it.
He answer'd me, 'Alhadra! thou art worthy 380
A nobler secret; but I have been faithful
To this bad man, and faithful I will be.'
He said, and arm'd himself, and lit a torch;
Then kiss'd his children, each one on its pillow,
And hurried from me. But I follow'd him 385
At distance, till I saw him enter there.

Naomi. The cavern?

Alhadra. Yes&mdash;the mouth of yonder cavern.
After a pause I saw the son of Velez
Rush by with flaring torch; he likewise enter'd&mdash;
There was another and a longer pause&mdash; 390
And once, methought, I heard the clash of swords,
And soon the son of Velez reappear'd.
He flung his torch towards the moon in sport,
And seem'd as he were mirthful! I stood listening
Impatient for the footsteps of my husband! 395

Maurice. Thou called'st him?

Alhadra. I crept into the cavern:
[582]
'Twas dark and very silent. [Then wildly.
What said'st thou?
No, no! I did not dare call, Ferdinand!
Lest I should hear no answer. A brief while,
Belike, I lost all thought and memory 400
Of that for which I came! After that pause,
O God! I heard a groan!&mdash;and follow'd it.
And yet another groan&mdash;which guided me
Into a strange recess&mdash;and there was light,
A hideous light! his torch lay on the ground&mdash; 405
Its flame burnt dimly o'er a chasm's brink.
I spake&mdash;and while I spake, a feeble groan
Came from that chasm! It was his last! his death groan!

Maurice. Comfort her, comfort her, Almighty Father!

Alhadra. I stood in unimaginable trance 410
And agony, that cannot be remember'd,
Listening with horrid hope to hear a groan!
But I had heard his last&mdash;my husband's death-groan!

Naomi. Haste! let us go!

Alhadra. I look'd far down the pit.
My sight was bounded by a jutting fragment, 415
And it was stain'd with blood! Then first I shriek'd!
My eyeballs burnt! my brain grew hot as fire!
And all the hanging drops of the wet roof
Turn'd into blood. I saw them turn to blood!
And I was leaping wildly down the chasm 420
When on the further brink I saw his sword,
And it said, Vengeance! Curses on my tongue!
The moon hath moved in heaven, and I am here,
And he hath not had vengeance! Ferdinand!
Spirit of Ferdinand! thy murderer lives! 425
Away! away! [She rushes off, all following.

Editor's Note.

[565:1] Against this passage Coleridge has written in MS.
II:&mdash;'This will be held by many for a mere Tragedy-dream&mdash;by many who
have never given themselves the trouble to ask themselves from what
grounds dreams pleased in Tragedy, and wherefore they have become so
common. I believe, however, that in the present case, the whole is here
psychologically true and accurate. Prophetical dreams are things of
nature, and explicable by that law of the mind in which where dim ideas
are connected with vivid feelings, Perception and Imagination insinuate
themselves and mix with the forms of Recollection, till the Present
appears to exactly correspond with the Past. Whatever is partially like,
the Imagination will gradually represent as wholly like&mdash;a law of our
nature which, when it is perfectly understood, woe to the great city
Babylon&mdash;to all the superstitions of Men!' P. W., 1893, p. 499.

[567:1] Against this passage Coleridge writes in MS.
II:&mdash;'Under the mask of the third person Osorio relates his own story,
as in the delusion of self-justification and pride, it appeared to
himself&mdash;at least as he wished it to appear to himself.' P. W., 1893,
p. 499.

'Osorio darkly, and in the feeling of self-justification, tells what he
conceives of his own character and actions&mdash;speaking of himself in the
third person.' MS. III.

[570:1] Against this line Coleridge writes in MS. II:&mdash;'Osorio
has thrust Ferdinand down the chasm. I think it an important instance
how Dreams and Prophecies co&ouml;perate to their own completion.' P. W.,

Floats round the flame, and makes as many colours

My torch extinguished by these water drops,
And marking that the moonlight came from thence,
I stept in to it, meaning to sit there;
But scarcely had I measured twenty paces&mdash;
My body bending forward, yea, o'erbalanced
Almost beyond recoil, on the dim brink
Of a hugh chasm I stept. The shadowy moonshine
Filling the void so counterfeited substance,
That my foot hung aslant adown the edge.
Was it my own fear?
Fear too hath its instincts!
(And yet such dens as these are wildly told of,
And there are beings that live, yet not for the eye)
An arm of frost above and from behind me
Pluck'd up and snatched me backward. Merciful Heaven!

The interior Court of a Saracenic or Gothic Castle with the iron gate
of a dungeon visible.


Teresa. Heart-chilling Superstition! thou canst glaze
Ev'n Pity's eye with her own frozen tear.
In vain I urge the tortures that await him:
Even Selma, reverend guardian of my childhood,
My second mother, shuts her heart against me!
Well, I have won from her what most imports
The present need, this secret of the dungeon
Known only to herself.&mdash;A Moor! a Sorcerer!
No, I have faith, that nature ne'er permitted
Baseness to wear a form so noble. True,
I doubt not, that Ordonio had suborned him
To act some part in some unholy fraud;
As little doubt, that for some unknown purpose
He hath baffled his suborner, terror-struck him,
And that Ordonio meditates revenge!
But my resolve is fixed! myself will rescue him,
And learn if haply he knew aught of Alvar.


Enter Valdez.


Valdez. Still sad?&mdash;and gazing at the massive door
Of that fell dungeon which thou ne'er had'st sight of,
Save what, perchance, thy infant fancy shap'd it
When the nurse still'd thy cries with unmeant threats.
Now by my faith, girl! this same wizard haunts thee!
A stately man, and eloquent and tender&mdash;
Who then need wonder if a lady sighs
Even at the thought of what these stern Dominicans&mdash;

Teresa. The horror of their ghastly punishments
Doth so o'ertop the height of all compassion,
That I should feel too little for mine enemy,
If it were possible I could feel more,
Even though the dearest inmates of our household
Were doom'd to suffer them. That such things are&mdash;

Between 262 and 268:


O that I had indeed the sorcerer's power.&mdash;
I would call up before thine eyes the image
Of my betrothed Alvar, of thy first-born!
His own fair countenance, his kingly forehead,
His tender smiles, love's day-dawn on his lips!
That spiritual and almost heavenly light
In his commanding eye&mdash;his mien heroic,
Virtue's own native heraldry! to man
Genial, and pleasant to his guardian angel.
Whene'er he gladden'd, how the gladness spread
Wide round him! and when oft with swelling tears,
Flash'd through by indignation, he bewail'd
The wrongs of Belgium's martyr'd patriots,
Oh, what a grief was there&mdash;for joy to envy,
Or gaze upon enamour'd!
O my father!
Recall that morning when we knelt together,
And thou didst bless our loves! O even now,
Even now, my sire! to thy mind's eye present him,
As at that moment he rose up before thee,
Stately, with beaming look! Place, place beside him
Ordonio's dark perturbed countenance!
Then bid me (Oh thou could'st not) bid me turn
From him, the joy, the triumph of our kind!
To take in exchange that brooding man, who never
Lifts up his eye from the earth, unless to scowl.

Teresa. O grief! to hear
Hateful intreaties from a voice we love!


Enter a Peasant and presents a letter to Valdez.


Valdez (reading it). 'He dares not venture hither!' Why what can this mean?
'Lest the Familiars of the Inquisition,
That watch around my gates, should intercept him;
But he conjures me, that without delay
I hasten to him&mdash;for my own sake entreats me
To guard from danger him I hold imprison'd&mdash;
He will reveal a secret, the joy of which
Will even outweigh the sorrow.'&mdash;Why what can this be?
Perchance it is some Moorish stratagem,
To have in me a hostage for his safety.
Nay, that they dare not! Ho! collect my servants!
I will go thither&mdash;let them arm themselves. [Exit Valdez.

Teresa (alone). The moon is high in heaven, and all is hush'd.
Yet anxious listener! I have seem'd to hear
A low dead thunder mutter thro' the night,
As 'twere a giant angry in his sleep.
O Alvar! Alvar! &amp;c.

And this majestic Moor, seems he not one

Hence womanish fears, traitors to love and duty&mdash;

    Could drink in life from the universal air!

ACT THE FIFTH

Scene the First.&mdash;The Sea Shore.

Naomi and a Moresco.


Moresco. This was no time for freaks of useless vengeance.

Naomi. True! but Francesco, the Inquisitor,
Thou know'st the bloodhound&mdash;'twas a strong temptation.
And when they pass'd within a mile of his house,
We could not curb them in. They swore by Mahomet, 5
It were a deed of treachery to their brethren
To sail from Spain and leave that man alive.

Moresco. Where is Alhadra?

Naomi. She moved steadily on
Unswerving from the path of her resolve.
Yet each strange object fix'd her eye: for grief 10
Doth love to dally with fantastic shapes,
And smiling, like a sickly moralist,
Gives some resemblance of her own concerns
To the straws of chance, and things inanimate.
I seek her here; stand thou upon the watch. 15


[Exit Moresco.


Naomi (looking wistfully to the distance). Stretch'd on the rock! It must be she&mdash;Alhadra!


[Alhadra rises from the rock, and advances slowly, as if musing.


Naomi. Once more, well met! what ponder'st thou so deeply?

Alhadra. I scarce can tell thee! For my many thoughts
Troubled me, till with blank and naked mind
I only listen'd to the dashing billows. 20
It seems to me, I could have closed my eyes
And wak'd without a dream of what has pass'd;
So well it counterfeited quietness,
This wearied heart of mine!

Naomi. 'Tis thus by nature
Wisely ordain'd, that so excess of sorrow 25
Might bring its own cure with it.

Alhadra. Would to Heaven
[584]
That it had brought its last and certain cure!
That ruin in the wood.

Naomi. It is a place
Of ominous fame; but 'twas the shortest road,
Nor could we else have kept clear of the village. 30
Yet some among us, as they scal'd the wall,
Mutter'd old rhyming prayers.

Alhadra. On that broad wall
I saw a skull; a poppy grew beside it,
There was a ghastly solace in the sight!

Naomi. I mark'd it not, and in good truth the night-bird 35
Curdled my blood, even till it prick'd the heart.
Its note comes dreariest in the fall of the year:
[Looking round impatiently.
Why don't they come? I will go forth and meet them.
[Exit Naomi.

Alhadra (alone). The hanging woods, that touch'd by autumn seem'd
As they were blossoming hues of fire and gold, 40
The hanging woods, most lovely in decay,
The many clouds, the sea, the rock, the sands,
Lay in the silent moonshine; and the owl,
(Strange! very strange!) the scritch owl only wak'd,
Sole voice, sole eye of all that world of beauty! 45
Why such a thing am I! Where are these men?
I need the sympathy of human faces
To beat away this deep contempt for all things
Which quenches my revenge. Oh!&mdash;would to Alla
The raven and the sea-mew were appointed 50
To bring me food, or rather that my soul
Could drink in life from the universal air!
It were a lot divine in some small skiff,
Along some ocean's boundless solitude,
To float for ever with a careless course, 55
And think myself the only being alive! [Naomi re-enters.

Naomi. Thy children&mdash;&mdash;

Alhadra. Children? Whose children?
[A pause&mdash;then fiercely.
Son of Velez,
[585]
This hath new-strung my arm! Thou coward tyrant,
To stupify a woman's heart with anguish, 60
Till she forgot even that she was a mother!


[A noise&mdash;enter a part of the Morescoes; and from the opposite side
of the stage a Moorish Seaman.


Moorish Seaman. The boat is on the shore, the vessel waits.
Your wives and children are already stow'd;
I left them prattling of the Barbary coast,
Of Mosks, and minarets, and golden crescents. 65
Each had her separate dream; but all were gay,
Dancing, in thought, to finger-beaten timbrels!


[Enter Maurice and the rest of the Morescoes dragging in Francesco.


Francesco. O spare me, spare me! only spare my life!

An Old Man. All hail, Alhadra! O that thou hadst heard him
When first we dragg'd him forth!
[Then turning to the band.
Here! in her presence&mdash;&mdash; 70


[He advances with his sword as about to kill him. Maurice leaps in and
stands with his drawn sword between Francesco and the Morescoes.


Maurice. Nay, but ye shall not!

Old Man. Shall not? Hah? Shall not?

Maurice. What, an unarm'd man?
A man that never wore a sword? A priest?
It is unsoldierly! I say, ye shall not!

Old Man (turning to the bands). He bears himself most like an insolent Spaniard! 75

Maurice. And ye like slaves, that have destroy'd their master,
But know not yet what freedom means; how holy
And just a thing it is! He's a fallen foe!
Come, come, forgive him!

All. No, by Mahomet!

Francesco. O mercy, mercy! talk to them of mercy! 80

Old Man. Mercy to thee! No, no, by Mahomet!

Maurice. Nay, Mahomet taught mercy and forgiveness.
I am sure he did!

Old Man. Ha! Ha! Forgiveness! Mercy!

Maurice. If he did not, he needs it for himself!


[586]


Alhadra. Blaspheming fool! the law of Mahomet 85
Was given by him, who framed the soul of man.
This the best proof&mdash;it fits the soul of man!
Ambition, glory, thirst of enterprize,
The deep and stubborn purpose of revenge,
With all the boiling revelries of pleasure&mdash; 90
These grow in the heart, yea, intertwine their roots
With its minutest fibres! And that Being
Who made us, laughs to scorn the lying faith,
Whose puny precepts, like a wall of sand,
Would stem the full tide of predestined Nature! 95

Naomi (who turns toward Francesco with his sword). Speak!

All (to Alhadra). Speak!

Alhadra. Is the murderer of your chieftain dead?
Now as God liveth, who hath suffer'd him
To make my children orphans, none shall die
Till I have seen his blood!
Off with him to the vessel!
[A part of the Morescoes hurry him off.

Alhadra. The Tyger, that with unquench'd cruelty, 100
Still thirsts for blood, leaps on the hunter's spear
With prodigal courage. 'Tis not so with man.

Maurice. It is not so, remember that, my friends!
Cowards are cruel, and the cruel cowards.

Alhadra. Scatter yourselves, take each a separate way, 105
And move in silence to the house of Velez. [Exeunt.



Scene.&mdash;A Dungeon.

Albert (alone) rises slowly from a bed of reeds.


Albert. And this place my forefathers made for men!
This is the process of our love and wisdom
To each poor brother who offends against us&mdash;
Most innocent, perhaps&mdash;and what if guilty? 110
Is this the only cure? Merciful God!
Each pore and natural outlet shrivell'd up
By ignorance and parching poverty,
His energies roll back upon his heart,
And stagnate and corrupt till changed to poison, 115
[587]
They break out on him like a loathsome plague-spot!
Then we call in our pamper'd mountebanks&mdash;
And this is their best cure! uncomforted
And friendless solitude, groaning and tears,
And savage faces at the clanking hour 120
Seen thro' the steaming vapours of his dungeon
By the lamp's dismal twilight! So he lies
Circled with evil, till his very soul
Unmoulds its essence, hopelessly deform'd
By sights of ever more deformity! 125
With other ministrations thou, O Nature!
Healest thy wandering and distemper'd child:
Thou pourest on him thy soft influences,
Thy sunny hues, fair forms, and breathing sweets,
Thy melodies of woods, and winds, and waters, 130
Till he relent, and can no more endure
To be a jarring and a dissonant thing
Amid this general dance and minstrelsy;
But bursting into tears wins back his way,
His angry spirit heal'd and harmoniz'd 135
By the benignant touch of love and beauty.


[A noise at the dungeon-door. It opens, and Osorio enters with a goblet
in his hand.

[588]


Osorio. Hail, potent wizard! In my gayer mood
I pour'd forth a libation to old Pluto;
[589]
And as I brimm'd the bowl, I thought of thee!

Albert (in a low voice). I have not summon'd up my heart to give 140
That pang, which I must give thee, son of Velez!

Osorio (with affected levity). Thou hast conspired against my life and honour,
Hast trick'd me foully; yet I hate thee not!
Why should I hate thee? This same world of ours&mdash;
It is a puddle in a storm of rain, 145
And we the air-bladders, that course up and down,
And joust and tilt in merry tournament,
And when one bubble runs foul of another,
[Waving his hand at Albert.
The lesser must needs break!

Albert. I see thy heart!
There is a frightful glitter in thine eye, 150
[590]
Which doth betray thee. Crazy-conscienc'd man,
This is the gaiety of drunken anguish,
Which fain would scoff away the pang of guilt,
And quell each human feeling!

Osorio. Feeling! feeling!
The death of a man&mdash;the breaking of a bubble. 155
'Tis true, I cannot sob for such misfortunes!
But faintness, cold, and hunger&mdash;curses on me
If willingly I e'er inflicted them!
Come, share the beverage&mdash;this chill place demands it.
Friendship and wine! [Osorio proffers him the goblet.

Albert. Yon insect on the wall, 160
Which moves this way and that its hundred legs,
Were it a toy of mere mechanic craft,
It were an infinitely curious thing!
But it has life, Osorio! life and thought;
And by the power of its miraculous will 165
Wields all the complex movements of its frame
Unerringly, to pleasurable ends!
Saw I that insect on this goblet's brink,
I would remove it with an eager terror.

Osorio. What meanest thou?

Albert. There's poison in the wine. 170

Osorio. Thou hast guess'd well. There's poison in the wine.
Shall we throw dice, which of us two shall drink it?
For one of us must die!

Albert. Whom dost thou think me?

Osorio. The accomplice and sworn friend of Ferdinand.

Albert. Ferdinand! Ferdinand! 'tis a name I know not. 175

Osorio. Good! good! that lie! by Heaven! it has restor'd me.
[591]
Now I am thy master! Villain, thou shalt drink it,
Or die a bitterer death.

Albert. What strange solution
Hast thou found out to satisfy thy fears,
And drug them to unnatural sleep?
[Albert takes the goblet, and with a sigh throws it on the ground.
My master! 180

Osorio. Thou mountebank!

Albert. Mountebank and villain!
What then art thou? For shame, put up thy sword!
What boots a weapon in a wither'd arm?
I fix mine eye upon thee, and thou tremblest!
I speak&mdash;and fear and wonder crush thy rage, 185
And turn it to a motionless distraction!
Thou blind self-worshipper! thy pride, thy cunning,
Thy faith in universal villainy,
Thy shallow sophisms, thy pretended scorn
For all thy human brethren&mdash;out upon them! 190
What have they done for thee? Have they given thee peace?
Cured thee of starting in thy sleep? or made
The darkness pleasant, when thou wakest at midnight?
Art happy when alone? can'st walk by thyself
With even step, and quiet cheerfulness? 195
Yet, yet thou mayst be saved.

Osorio (stupidly reiterating the word). Saved? saved?

Albert. One pang&mdash;
Could I call up one pang of true remorse!

Osorio. He told me of the babe, that prattled to him,
His fatherless little ones! Remorse! remorse!
Where gott'st thou that fool's word? Curse on remorse! 200
Can it give up the dead, or recompact
A mangled body&mdash;mangled, dash'd to atoms!
Not all the blessings of an host of angels
Can blow away a desolate widow's curse;
And tho' thou spill thy heart's blood for atonement, 205
It will not weigh against an orphan's tear.

Albert (almost overcome by his feelings). But Albert&mdash;&mdash;

Osorio. Ha! it chokes thee in the throat,
[592]Even thee! and yet, I pray thee, speak it out.
Still Albert! Albert! Howl it in mine ear!
Heap it, like coals of fire, upon my heart! 210
And shoot it hissing through my brain!

Albert. Alas&mdash;
That day, when thou didst leap from off the rock
Into the waves, and grasp'd thy sinking brother,
And bore him to the strand, then, son of Velez!
How sweet and musical the name of Albert! 215
Then, then, Osorio! he was dear to thee,
And thou wert dear to him. Heaven only knows
How very dear thou wert! Why didst thou hate him?
O Heaven! how he would fall upon thy neck,
And weep forgiveness!

Osorio. Spirit of the dead! 220
Methinks I know thee! Ha!&mdash;my brain turns wild
At its own dreams&mdash;off&mdash;off, fantastic shadow!

Albert (seizing his hand). I fain would tell thee what I am, but dare not!

Osorio (retiring from him). Cheat, villain, traitor! whatsoe'er thou be
I fear thee, man!
[He starts, and stands in the attitude of listening.
And is this too my madness? 225

Albert. It is the step of one that treads in fear
Seeking to cheat the echo.

Osorio. It approaches&mdash;
This nook shall hide me.


[Maria enters from a plank which slips to and fro.


Maria. I have put aside
The customs and the terrors of a woman,
To work out thy escape. Stranger! begone, 230
And only tell me what thou know'st of Albert.


[Albert takes her portrait from his neck, and gives it her with
unutterable tenderness.

[593]


Albert. Maria! my Maria!

Maria. Do not mock me.
This is my face&mdash;and thou&mdash;ha! who art thou?
Nay, I will call thee Albert!


[She falls upon his neck. Osorio leaps out from the nook with frantic
wildness, and rushes towards Albert with his sword. Maria gapes at him,
as one helpless with terror, then leaves Albert, and flings herself upon
Osorio, arresting his arm.


Maria. Madman, stop!

Albert (with majesty and tenderness). Does then this thin disguise impenetrably 235
Hide Albert from thee? Toil and painful wounds,
And long imprisonment in unwholesome dungeons,
Have marr'd perhaps all trace and lineament
Of what I was! But chiefly, chiefly, brother!
My anguish for thy guilt. Spotless Maria, 240
I thought thee guilty too! Osorio, brother!
Nay, nay, thou shalt embrace me!

Osorio (drawing back and gazing at Albert with a countenance expressive at once of awe and terror). Touch me not!
Touch not pollution, Albert!&mdash;I will die!


[He attempts to fall on his sword. Albert and Maria struggle with him.


Albert. We will invent some tale to save your honour.
Live, live, Osorio!

Maria. You may yet be happy. 245

Osorio (looking at Maria). O horror! Not a thousand years in heaven
Could recompose this miserable heart,
Or make it capable of one brief joy.
Live! live!&mdash;why yes! 'Twere well to live with you&mdash;
[594]
For is it fit a villain should be proud? 250
My brother! I will kneel to you, my brother!
[Throws himself at Albert's feet.
Forgive me, Albert!&mdash;Curse me with forgiveness!

Albert. Call back thy soul, my brother! and look round thee.
Now is the time for greatness. Think that Heaven&mdash;&mdash;

Maria. O mark his eye! he hears not what you say. 255

Osorio (pointing at vacancy). Yes, mark his eye! there's fascination in it.
Thou said'st thou didst not know him. That is he!
He comes upon me!

Albert (lifting his eye to heaven). Heal, O heal him, Heaven!

Osorio. Nearer and nearer! And I cannot stir!
Will no one hear these stifled groans, and wake me? 260
He would have died to save me, and I kill'd him&mdash;
A husband and a father!

Maria. Some secret poison
Drinks up his spirit!

Osorio (fiercely recollecting himself). Let the eternal Justice
Prepare my punishment in the obscure world.
I will not bear to live&mdash;to live! O agony! 265
And be myself alone, my own sore torment!


[The doors of the dungeon are burst open with a crash. Alhadra,
Maurice, and the band of Morescoes enter.


Alhadra (pointing at Osorio). Seize first that man!


[The Moors press round.


Albert (rushing in among them). Draw thy sword, Maurice, and defend my brother.


[A scuffle, during which they disarm Maurice.


Osorio. Off, ruffians! I have flung away my sword.
Woman, my life is thine! to thee I give it. 270
Off! he that touches me with his hand of flesh,
I'll rend his limbs asunder! I have strength
With this bare arm to scatter you like ashes!


[595]


Alhadra. My husband&mdash;&mdash;

Osorio. Yes! I murder'd him most foully.

Albert (throws himself on the earth). O horrible!

Alhadra. Why didst thou leave his children? 275
Demon! thou shouldst have sent thy dogs of hell
To lap their blood. Then, then, I might have harden'd
My soul in misery, and have had comfort.
I would have stood far off, quiet tho' dark,
And bade the race of men raise up a mourning 280
For the deep horror of a desolation
Too great to be one soul's particular lot!
Brother of Zagri! let me lean upon thee.
[Struggling to suppress her anguish.
The time is not yet come for woman's anguish&mdash;
I have not seen his blood. Within an hour 285
Those little ones will crowd around and ask me,
Where is our father? [Looks at Osorio.
I shall curse thee then!
Wert thou in heaven, my curse would pluck thee thence!

Maria. See&mdash;see! he doth repent. I kneel to thee.
Be merciful!
[Maria kneels to her. Alhadra regards her face wistfully.

Alhadra. Thou art young and innocent; 290
'Twere merciful to kill thee! Yet I will not.
And for thy sake none of this house shall perish,
[596]
Save only he.

Maria. That aged man, his father!

Alhadra (sternly). Why had he such a son?


[The Moors press on.


Maria (still kneeling, and wild with affright). Yet spare his life!
They must not murder him!

Alhadra. And is it then 295
An enviable lot to waste away
With inward wounds, and like the spirit of chaos
To wander on disquietly thro' the earth,
Cursing all lovely things? to let him live&mdash;
It were a deep revenge!

All the band cry out&mdash;No mercy! no mercy! 300


[Naomi advances with the sword towards Osorio.


Alhadra. Nay, bear him forth! Why should this innocent maid
Behold the ugliness of death?

Osorio (with great majesty). O woman!
I have stood silent like a slave[596:1] before thee,
That I might taste the wormwood and the gall,
And satiate this self-accusing spirit 305
With bitterer agonies than death can give.


[The Moors gather round him in a crowd, and pass off the stage.


Alhadra. I thank thee, Heaven! thou hast ordain'd it wisely,
That still extremes bring their own cure. That point
In misery which makes the oppressed man
Regardless of his own life, makes him too 310
Lord of the oppressor's! Knew I an hundred men
Despairing, but not palsied by despair,
This arm should shake the kingdoms of this world;
[597]
The deep foundations of iniquity
Should sink away, earth groaning from beneath them; 315
The strong holds of the cruel men should fall,
Their temples and their mountainous towers should fall;
Till desolation seem'd a beautiful thing,
And all that were and had the spirit of life
Sang a new song to him who had gone forth 320
Conquering and still to conquer!

III: om. Remorse.

Between 136 and 137:


I am chill and weary, &amp;c. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. honest purpose.


Enter Teresa with a taper.


Teresa. It has chilled my very life&mdash;my own voice scares me;
Yet when I hear it not I seem to lose
The substance of my being&mdash;my strongest grasp
Sends inwards but weak witness that I am.
I seek to cheat the echo.&mdash;How the half sounds
Blend with this strangled light! Is he not here&mdash;
[Looking round.
O for one human face here&mdash;but to see
One human face here to sustain me.&mdash;Courage!
It is but my own fear! The life within me,
It sinks and wavers like this cone of flame,
Beyond which I scarce dare look onward! Oh!
If I faint? If this inhuman den should be
At once my death-bed and my burial vault?
[Faintly screams as Alvar emerges from the recess.

Alvar (rushes towards her, and catches her as she is falling). O gracious heaven! it is, it is Teresa!
Shall I reveal myself? The sudden shock
Of rapture will blow out this spark of life,
And joy complete what terror has begun.
O ye impetuous beatings here, be still!
Teresa, best beloved! pale, pale, and cold!
Her pulse doth flutter! Teresa! my Teresa!

Teresa (recovering). I heard a voice; but often in my dreams
I hear that voice! and wake and try&mdash;and try&mdash;
To hear it waking! but I never could&mdash;
And 'tis so now&mdash;even so! Well! he is dead&mdash;
Murdered perhaps! And I am faint, and feel
As if it were no painful thing to die!

Alvar. Believe it not, sweet maid! Believe it not,
Beloved woman! 'Twas a low imposture
Framed by a guilty wretch.

Teresa. Ha! Who art thou?

Alvar. Suborned by his brother&mdash;

Teresa. Didst thou murder him?
And dost thou now repent? Poor troubled man,
I do forgive thee, and may Heaven forgive thee!

Alvar. Ordonio&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;

Teresa. If thou didst murder him&mdash;
His spirit ever at the throne of God
Asks mercy for thee: prays for mercy for thee,
With tears in Heaven!

Alvar. Alvar was not murdered.
Be calm! be calm, sweet maid!

Teresa. Nay, nay, but tell me! [A pause.
O 'tis lost again!
This dull confused pain&mdash; [A pause.
Mysterious man!
Methinks I can not fear thee: for thine eye
Doth swim with love and pity&mdash;Well! Ordonio&mdash;
Oh my foreboding heart! And he suborned thee,
And thou didst spare his life? Blessings shower on thee,
As many as the drops twice counted o'er
In the fond faithful heart of his Teresa!

Alvar. I can endure no more. The Moorish sorcerer
Exists but in the stain upon his face.
That picture&mdash;&mdash;

Teresa. Ha! speak on!

Alvar. Beloved Teresa!
It told but half the truth. O let this portrait
Tell all&mdash;that Alvar lives&mdash;that he is here!
Thy much deceived but ever faithful Alvar.
[Takes her portrait from his neck, and gives it her.

Teresa (receiving the portrait). The same&mdash;it is the same. Ah! Who art thou?
Nay, I will call thee, Alvar! [She falls on his neck.

Alvar. O joy unutterable!
But hark! a sound as of removing bars
At the dungeon's outer door. A brief, brief while
Conceal thyself, my love! It is Ordonio.
For the honour of our race, for our dear father;
O for himself too (he is still my brother)
Let me recall him to his nobler nature,
That he may wake as from a dream of murder!
O let me reconcile him to himself,
Open the sacred source of penitent tears,
And be once more his own beloved Alvar.

Teresa. O my all virtuous love! I fear to leave thee
With that obdurate man.

Alvar. Thou dost not leave me!
But a brief while retire into the darkness:
O that my joy could spread its sunshine round thee!

Teresa. The sound of thy voice shall be my music!
Alvar! my Alvar! am I sure I hold thee?
Is it no dream? thee in my arms, my Alvar! [Exit.

Teresa. Me too, my Father?

Valdez. Bless, Oh, bless my children!

Alvar. Delights so full, if unalloyed with grief,
Were ominous. In these strange dread events
Just Heaven instructs us with an awful voice,
That Conscience rules us e'en against our choice.
Our inward monitress to guide or warn,
If listened to; but if repelled with scorn,
At length as dire Remorse, she reappears,
Works in our guilty hopes, and selfish fears!
Still bids, Remember! and still cries, Too late!
And while she scares us, goads us to our fate.


Remorse.



[598]
THE PICCOLOMINI[598:1]

OR, THE FIRST PART OF WALLENSTEIN

&nbsp;
A DRAMA

TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN OF SCHILLER



PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION

It was my intention to have prefixed a Life of Wallenstein to this
translation; but I found that it must either have occupied a space
wholly disproportionate to the nature of the publication, or have been
merely a meagre catalogue of events narrated not more fully than they
already are in the Play itself. The recent translation, likewise, of
Schiller's History of the Thirty Years' [599]War diminished the motives
thereto. In the translation I endeavoured to render my Author literally
wherever I was not prevented by absolute differences of idiom; but I am
conscious that in two or three short passages I have been guilty of
dilating the original; and, from anxiety to give the full meaning, have
weakened the force. In the metre I have availed myself of no other
liberties than those which Schiller had permitted to himself, except the
occasional breaking-up of the line by the substitution of a trochee for
an iambus; of which liberty, so frequent in our tragedies, I find no
instance in these dramas.

S. T. Coleridge.



FOOTNOTES:

[598:1] First published in a single octavo volume, 1800:
included in 1828, 1829, 1834, and in Dramatic Works (one vol. 8vo)
1852. The Piccolomini and the Death of Wallenstein were translated
from MS. copies which had been acquired by the Messrs. Longman. The MS.
copy of the original of the Death of Wallenstein is in the possession
of Mrs. Alexander Gillman. The MS. of the copy of the original of the
Piccolomini was at one time in the possession of Mr. Henry R. Mark of
17 Highbury Crescent. A note in Schiller's handwriting, dated 'Jena, 30.
September 1799', attesting the genuineness of the copies, is attached to
either play. The MS. copy of Wallenstein's Camp ('Wallenstein's
Lager'), which Coleridge did not attempt to translate, is not
forthcoming. See two articles by Ferdinand Freiligrath, published in the
Athen&aelig;um, July 15 and August 31, 1861. See, too, Die
Wallenstein&uuml;bersetzung von Samuel T. Coleridge und ihr Deutsches
Original .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. vorgelegt von Hans Roscher. Borna-Leipzig, 1905. A copy of
the translation which Macready marked for acting is in the Forster
Library, which forms part of the Victoria and Albert Museum at South
Kensington. See note by J. Dykes Campbell, P. W., 1893, p. 649. An
annotated copy (in Coleridge's handwriting) of the translation of the
Piccolomini and the Death of Wallenstein, presented by Mr. Shadworth
Hodgson, is in the Library of Rugby School [MS. R.]. The MS. contents
of this volume are now published for the first time. Coleridge began his
translation of the two plays at No. 21 Buckingham Street, Strand, in
December, 1799, and finished the 'last sheet' at Town End, Grasmere,
April 20, 1800.

'These dramas have two grievous faults: they are prolix in the
particular parts and slow in the general movement. But they have
passion, distinct and diversified character, and they abound in passages
of great moral and poetic beauty.' S. T. Coleridge.

'The defects of these dramas are all of an instructive character; for
tho' not the products of genius, like those of Shakespere, they result
from an energetic and thinking mind. (1) The speeches are seldom suited
to characters&mdash;the characters are truly diversified and distinctly
conceived&mdash;but we learn them from the actions and from the descriptions
given by other characters, or from particular speeches. The brutal Illo
repeatedly talks language which belongs to the Countess, &amp;c. (2)
Astrology (an undramatic superstition because it inspires no terror, and
its foundation of imagination is overbuilt and concealed by its
scientific superstructure, with other cause from the imagery, is thus
unpopular or swallowed up in more general and pleasing associations, as
the Sun and Moon) is made prophetic, and yet treated ludicrously: the
author as philosopher is in compleat discord with himself as Historian.
This is a most grievous fault. (3) The assassins talk ludicrously. This
is a most egregious misimitation of Shakespere&mdash;Schiller should not have
attempted tragico-comedy, and none but Shakespere has succeeded. It is
wonderful, however, that Schiller, who had studied Shakespere, should
not have perceived his divine judgment in the management of his
assassins, as in Macbeth. They are fearful and almost pitiable
Beings&mdash;not loathsome, ludicrous miscreants. (4) The character of Thekla
= O, the bold Heroine of any novel. Nothing of the Convent, no
superstition, nothing of the Daughter of Wallenstein, nothing that her
past life is represented by. (5) Wallenstein is a finer psychological
than dramatic, and a more dramatic than a tragic character. Shakespere
draws strength as in Richard the Third, and even when he blends
weakness as in Macbeth&mdash;yet it is weakness of a specific kind that
leaves the strength in full and fearful energy&mdash;but Schiller has drawn
weakness imposing on itself the love of power for the sense of strength
(a fine conception in itself, but not tragic&mdash;at least for the principal
character of a long drama).&mdash;Hence Wallenstein, with one exception (that
of the Regimental Deputation to him in the Second Part) evaporates in
mock-mysterious speeches. These are the chief defects, I think. On the
other hand, the character of Butler is admirable throughout. Octavio is
very grand, and Max, tho' it may be an easy character to draw, for a man
of thought and lofty feeling&mdash;for a man who possesses all the analoga
of genius, is yet so delightful, and its moral influence so grand and
salutary, that we must allow it great praise. The childish love-toying
with the glove and Aunt Tertsky in the first act should be omitted.
Certain whole scenes are masterly, and far above anything since the
dramatists of Eliz. &amp; James the first.' Note on fly-leaf of annotated
copy (MS. R.).

THE PICCOLOMINI[600:1]



ACT I

Scene I

An old Gothic Chamber in the Council House at Pilsen, decorated with
Colours and other War Insignia.

Illo with Butler and Isolani.


Illo. Ye have come late&mdash;but ye are come! The distance,
Count Isolan, excuses your delay.

Isolani. Add this too, that we come not empty-handed.
At Donauwert[600:2] it was reported to us,
A Swedish caravan was on its way 5
Transporting a rich cargo of provision,
[601]Almost six hundred waggons. This my Croats
Plunged down upon and seized, this weighty prize!&mdash;&mdash;
We bring it hither&mdash;&mdash;

Illo. Just in time to banquet
The illustrious company assembled here. 10

Butler. 'Tis all alive! a stirring scene here!

Isolani. Ay!
The very churches are all full of soldiers.
And in the Council-house, too, I observe,
You're settled, quite at home! Well, well! we soldiers
Must shift and suit us in what way we can. 15

Illo. We have the Colonels here of thirty regiments.
You'll find Count Tertsky here, and Tiefenbach,
Kolatto, Goetz, Maradas, Hinnersam,
The Piccolomini, both son and father&mdash;&mdash;
You'll meet with many an unexpected greeting 20
From many an old friend and acquaintance. Only
Galas is wanting still, and Altringer.

Butler. Expect not Galas.

Illo. How so? Do you know&mdash;&mdash;

Isolani. Max Piccolomini here?&mdash;O bring me to him. 25
I see him yet, ('tis now ten years ago,
We were engaged with Mansfeld hard by Dessau)
I see the youth, in my mind's eye I see him,
Leap his black war-horse from the bridge adown,
And t'ward his father, then in extreme peril, 30
Beat up against the strong tide of the Elbe.
The down was scarce upon his chin! I hear
He has made good the promise of his youth,
And the full hero now is finished in him.

Illo. You'll see him yet ere evening. He conducts 35
The Duchess Friedland hither, and the Princess[601:1]
From Carnthen. We expect them here at noon.

Butler. Both wife and daughter does the Duke call hither?
He crowds in visitants from all sides.

Isolani. Hm!
So much the better! I had framed my mind 40
[602]
To hear of nought but warlike circumstance,
Of marches, and attacks, and batteries:
And lo! the Duke provides, that something too
Of gentler sort, and lovely, should be present
To feast our eyes. 45

Illo (aside to Butler). And how came you to know
That the Count Galas joins us not?

Butler. Because
He importuned me to remain behind.

Illo. And you?&mdash;You hold out firmly?
Noble Butler!

Butler. After the obligation which the Duke 50
Had laid so newly on me&mdash;&mdash;

Illo. I had forgotten
A pleasant duty&mdash;Major-General,
I wish you joy!

Isolani. What, you mean, of his regiment?
I hear, too, that to make the gift still sweeter, 55
The Duke has given him the very same
In which he first saw service, and since then,
Worked himself, step by step, through each preferment,
From the ranks upwards. And verily, it gives
A precedent of hope, a spur of action 60
To the whole corps, if once in their remembrance
An old deserving soldier makes his way.

Butler. I am perplexed and doubtful, whether or no
I dare accept this your congratulation.
The Emperor has not yet confirmed the appointment. 65

Isolani. Seize it, friend! Seize it! The hand which in that post
Placed you, is strong enough to keep you there,
Spite of the Emperor and his Ministers!

Illo. Ay, if we would but so consider it!&mdash;
If we would all of us consider it so! 70
The Emperor gives us nothing; from the Duke
Comes all&mdash;whate'er we hope, whate'er we have.

Isolani (to Illo). My noble brother! did I tell you how
The Duke will satisfy my creditors?
Will be himself my banker for the future, 75
[603]
Make me once more a creditable man!&mdash;
And this is now the third time, think of that!
This kingly-minded man has rescued me
From absolute ruin, and restored my honour.

Illo. O that his power but kept pace with his wishes! 80
Why, friend! he'd give the whole world to his soldiers.
But at Vienna, brother! here's the grievance!&mdash;
What politic schemes do they not lay to shorten
His arm, and, where they can, to clip his pinions.
Then these new dainty requisitions! these, 85
Which this same Questenberg brings hither!&mdash;

Butler. Ay,
These requisitions of the Emperor,&mdash;
I too have heard about them; but I hope
The Duke will not draw back a single inch! 90

Illo. Not from his right most surely, unless first
&mdash;From office!

Butler. Know you aught then? You alarm me.

Isolani (at the same time with Butler, and in a hurrying voice).
We should be ruined, every one of us!

Illo. No more!
Yonder I see our worthy friend[603:1] approaching
With the Lieutenant-General, Piccolomini.

Butler. I fear we shall not go hence as we came. 95

Scene II

Enter Octavio Piccolomini and Questenberg.


Octavio. Ay, ay! more still! Still more new visitors!
Acknowledge, friend! that never was a camp,
Which held at once so many heads of heroes.
Welcome, Count Isolani!

Isolani. My noble brother,
Even now am I arrived; it had been else my duty&mdash; 5

Octavio. And Colonel Butler&mdash;trust me, I rejoice
Thus to renew acquaintance with a man
Whose worth and services I know and honour.
See, see, my friend!
[604]
There might we place at once before our eyes 10
The sum of war's whole trade and mystery&mdash;
[To Questenberg, presenting Butler and Isolani at the same time to him.
These two the total sum&mdash;Strength and Dispatch.

Questenberg (to Octavio). And lo! betwixt them both experienced Prudence!

Octavio (presenting Questenberg to Butler and Isolani). The Chamberlain and War-commissioner Questenberg,
The bearer of the Emperor's behests, 15
The long-tried friend and patron of all soldiers,
We honour in this noble visitor.

Illo. 'Tis not the first time, noble Minister,
You have shewn our camp this honour.

Questenberg. Once before,
I stood before these colours. 20

Illo. Perchance too you remember where that was.
It was at Zn&auml;im[604:1] in Moravia, where
You did present yourself upon the part
Of the Emperor, to supplicate our Duke
That he would straight assume the chief command. 25

Questenberg. To supplicate? Nay, noble General!
So far extended neither my commission
(At least to my own knowledge) nor my zeal.

Illo. Well, well, then&mdash;to compel him, if you choose.
I can remember me right well, Count Tilly 30
Had suffered total rout upon the Lech.
Bavaria lay all open to the enemy,
Whom there was nothing to delay from pressing
Onwards into the very heart of Austria.
At that time you and Werdenberg appeared 35
Before our General, storming him with prayers,
And menacing the Emperor's displeasure,
Unless he took compassion on this wretchedness.

Isolani. Yes, yes, 'tis comprehensible enough,
Wherefore with your commission of to-day 40
[605]
You were not all too willing to remember
Your former one.

Questenberg. Why not, Count Isolan?
No contradiction sure exists between them.
It was the urgent business of that time 45
To snatch Bavaria from her enemy's hand;
And my commission of to-day instructs me
To free her from her good friends and protectors.

Illo. A worthy office! After with our blood
We have wrested this Bohemia from the Saxon, 50
To be swept out of it is all our thanks,
The sole reward of all our hard-won victories.

Questenberg. Unless that wretched land be doomed to suffer
Only a change of evils, it must be
Freed from the scourge alike of friend and foe. 55

Illo. What? 'Twas a favourable year; the Boors
Can answer fresh demands already.

Questenberg. Nay,
If you discourse of herds and meadow-grounds&mdash;

Isolani. The war maintains the war. Are the Boors ruined,
The Emperor gains so many more new soldiers. 60

Questenberg. And is the poorer by even so many subjects.

Isolani. Poh! We are all his subjects.

Questenberg. Yet with a difference, General! The one fill
With profitable industry the purse,
The others are well skilled to empty it. 65
The sword has made the Emperor poor; the plough
Must reinvigorate his resources.

Isolani. Sure!
Times are not yet so bad. Methinks I see
[Examining with his eye the dress and ornaments of Questenberg.
Good store of gold that still remains uncoined.

Questenberg. Thank Heaven! that means have been found out to hide 70
Some little from the fingers of the Croats.

Illo. There! The Stawata and the Martinitz,
On whom the Emperor heaps his gifts and graces,
To the heart-burning of all good Bohemians&mdash;
Those minions of court favour, those court harpies, 75
Who fatten on the wrecks of citizens
Driven from their house and home&mdash;who reap no harvests
[606]
Save in the general calamity&mdash;
Who now, with kingly pomp, insult and mock
The desolation of their country&mdash;these, 80
Let these, and such as these, support the war,
The fatal war, which they alone enkindled!

Butler. And those state-parasites, who have their feet
So constantly beneath the Emperor's table,
Who cannot let a benefice fall, but they 85
Snap at it with dog's hunger&mdash;they, forsooth,
Would pare the soldier's bread, and cross his reckoning!

Isolani. My life long will it anger me to think,
How when I went to court seven years ago,
To see about new horses for our regiment, 90
How from one antechamber to another
They dragged me on, and left me by the hour
To kick my heels among a crowd of simpering
Feast-fattened slaves, as if I had come thither
A mendicant suitor for the crumbs of favour 95
That fall beneath their tables. And, at last,
Whom should they send me but a Capuchin!
Straight I began to muster up my sins
For absolution&mdash;but no such luck for me!
This was the man, this Capuchin, with whom 100
I was to treat concerning the army horses:
And I was forced at last to quit the field,
The business unaccomplished. Afterwards
The Duke procured me in three days, what I
Could not obtain in thirty at Vienna. 105

Questenberg. Yes, yes! your travelling bills soon found their way to us:
Too well I know we have still accounts to settle.

Illo. War is a violent trade; one cannot always
Finish one's work by soft means; every trifle
Must not be blackened into sacrilege. 110
If we should wait till you, in solemn council,
With due deliberation had selected
The smallest out of four-and-twenty evils,
I'faith, we should wait long.&mdash;
'Dash! and through with it!'&mdash;That's the better watch-word. 115
Then after come what may come. 'Tis man's nature
[607]
To make the best of a bad thing once past.
A bitter and perplexed 'what shall I do?'
Is worse to man than worst necessity.

Questenberg. Ay, doubtless, it is true: the Duke does spare us 120
The troublesome task of choosing.

Butler. Yes, the Duke
Cares with a father's feelings for his troops;
But how the Emperor feels for us, we see.

Questenberg. His cares and feelings all ranks share alike,
Nor will he offer one up to another. 125

Isolani. And therefore thrusts he us into the deserts
As beasts of prey, that so he may preserve
His dear sheep fattening in his fields at home.

Questenberg. Count, this comparison you make, not I.

Butler. Why, were we all the Court supposes us, 130
'Twere dangerous, sure, to give us liberty.

Questenberg. You have taken liberty&mdash;it was not given you.
And therefore it becomes an urgent duty
To rein it in with curbs.

Octavio. My noble friend,
This is no more than a remembrancing 135
That you are now in camp, and among warriors.
The soldier's boldness constitutes his freedom.
Could he act daringly, unless he dared
Talk even so? One runs into the other.
The boldness of this worthy officer, [pointing to Butler. 140
Which now has but mistaken in its mark,
Preserved, when nought but boldness could preserve it,
To the Emperor his capital city, Prague,
In a most formidable mutiny
Of the whole garrison. [Military music at a distance. 145
Hah! here they come!

Illo. The sentries are saluting them: this signal
Announces the arrival of the Duchess.

Octavio. Then my son Max too has returned. 'Twas he
Fetched and attended them from Carnthen hither. 150

Isolani (to Illo). Shall we not go in company to greet them?

[608]

Illo. Well, let us go.&mdash;Ho! Colonel Butler, come.
[To Octavio.
You'll not forget, that yet ere noon we meet
The noble Envoy at the General's palace.


[Exeunt all but Questenberg and Octavio.

Scene III

Questenberg and Octavio.


Questenberg. What have I not been forced to hear, Octavio!
What sentiments! what fierce, uncurbed defiance!
And were this spirit universal&mdash;

Octavio. Hm!
You are now acquainted with three-fourths of the army.

Questenberg. Where must we seek then for a second host 5
To have the custody of this? That Illo
Thinks worse, I fear me, than he speaks. And then
This Butler too&mdash;he cannot even conceal
The passionate workings of his ill intentions.

Octavio. Quickness of temper&mdash;irritated pride; 10
'Twas nothing more. I cannot give up Butler.
I know a spell that will soon dispossess
The evil spirit in him.

Questenberg. Friend, friend!
O! this is worse, far worse, than we had suffered
Ourselves to dream of at Vienna. There 15
We saw it only with a courtier's eyes,
Eyes dazzled by the splendour of the throne.
We had not seen the War-Chief, the Commander,
The man all-powerful in his camp. Here, here,
'Tis quite another thing. 20
Here is no Emperor more&mdash;the Duke is Emperor.
Alas, my friend! alas, my noble friend!
This walk which you have ta'en me through the camp
Strikes my hopes prostrate.

Octavio. Now you see yourself
Of what a perilous kind the office is, 25
Which you deliver to me from the Court.
The least suspicion of the General
Costs me my freedom and my life, and would
But hasten his most desperate enterprise.


[609]


Questenberg. Where was our reason sleeping when we trusted 30
This madman with the sword, and placed such power
In such a hand? I tell you, he'll refuse,
Flatly refuse, to obey the Imperial orders.
Friend, he can do 't, and what he can, he will.
And then the impunity of his defiance&mdash; 35
O! what a proclamation of our weakness!

Octavio. D'ye think too, he has brought his wife and daughter
Without a purpose hither? Here in camp!
And at the very point of time, in which
We're arming for the war? That he has taken 40
These, the last pledges of his loyalty,
Away from out the Emperor's domains&mdash;
This is no doubtful token of the nearness
Of some eruption!

Questenberg. How shall we hold footing
Beneath this tempest, which collects itself 45
And threats us from all quarters? The enemy
Of the empire on our borders, now already
The master of the Danube, and still farther,
And farther still, extending every hour!
In our interior the alarum-bells 50
Of insurrection&mdash;peasantry in arms&mdash;&mdash;
All orders discontented&mdash;and the army,
Just in the moment of our expectation
Of aidance from it&mdash;lo! this very army
Seduced, run wild, lost to all discipline, 55
Loosened, and rent asunder from the state
And from their sovereign, the blind instrument
Of the most daring of mankind, a weapon
Of fearful power, which at his will he wields!

Octavio. Nay, nay, friend! let us not despair too soon, 60
Men's words are ever bolder than their deeds:
And many a resolute, who now appears
Made up to all extremes, will, on a sudden
Find in his breast a heart he knew not of,
Let but a single honest man speak out 65
The true name of his crime! Remember, too,
We stand not yet so wholly unprotected.
Counts Altringer and Galas have maintained
[610]
Their little army faithful to its duty,
And daily it becomes more numerous. 70
Nor can he take us by surprise: you know,
I hold him all-encompassed by my listeners.
Whate'er he does, is mine, even while 'tis doing&mdash;
No step so small, but instantly I hear it;
Yea, his own mouth discloses it.

Questenberg. 'Tis quite 75
Incomprehensible, that he detects not
The foe so near!

Octavio. Beware, you do not think,
That I by lying arts, and complaisant
Hypocrisy, have skulked into his graces:
Or with the sustenance of smooth professions 80
Nourish his all-confiding friendship! No&mdash;
Compelled alike by prudence, and that duty
Which we all owe our country, and our sovereign,
To hide my genuine feelings from him, yet
Ne'er have I duped him with base counterfeits! 85

Questenberg. It is the visible ordinance of heaven.

Octavio. I know not what it is that so attracts
And links him both to me and to my son.
Comrades and friends we always were&mdash;long habit,
Adventurous deeds performed in company, 90
And all those many and various incidents
Which store a soldier's memory with affections,
Had bound us long and early to each other&mdash;
Yet I can name the day, when all at once
His heart rose on me, and his confidence 95
Shot out in sudden growth. It was the morning
Before the memorable fight at L&uuml;tzner.
Urged by an ugly dream, I sought him out,
To press him to accept another charger.
At distance from the tents, beneath a tree, 100
I found him in a sleep. When I had waked him,
And had related all my bodings to him,
Long time he stared upon me, like a man
Astounded; thereon fell upon my neck,
And manifested to me an emotion 105
That far outstripped the worth of that small service.
Since then his confidence has followed me
With the same pace that mine has fled from him.


[611]


Questenberg. You lead your son into the secret?

Octavio. No!

Questenberg. What? and not warn him either what bad hands 110
His lot has placed him in?

Octavio. I must perforce
Leave him in wardship to his innocence.
His young and open soul&mdash;dissimulation
Is foreign to its habits! Ignorance
Alone can keep alive the cheerful air, 115
The unembarrassed sense and light free spirit,
That make the Duke secure.

Questenberg. My honoured friend! most highly do I deem
Of Colonel Piccolomini&mdash;yet&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;
Reflect a little&mdash;&mdash;

Octavio. I must venture it. 120
Hush!&mdash;There he comes!

Scene IV

Max Piccolomini, Octavio Piccolomini, Questenberg.


Max. Ha! there he is himself. Welcome, my father!
You are engaged, I see. I'll not disturb you.

Octavio. How, Max? Look closer at this visitor;
Attention, Max, an old friend merits&mdash;Reverence
Belongs of right to the envoy of your sovereign. 5

Max. Von Questenberg!&mdash;Welcome&mdash;if you bring with you
Aught good to our head quarters.

Questenberg (seizing his hand). Nay, draw not
Your hand away, Count Piccolomini!
Not on mine own account alone I seized it,
And nothing common will I say therewith. 10
[Taking the hands of both.
Octavio&mdash;Max Piccolomini!
O saviour names, and full of happy omen!
Ne'er will her prosperous genius turn from Austria,
While two such stars, with blessed influences
Beaming protection, shine above her hosts. 15

Max. Heh!&mdash;Noble minister! You miss your part.
[612]
You came not here to act a panegyric.
You're sent, I know, to find fault and to scold us&mdash;
I must not be beforehand with my comrades.

Octavio. He comes from court, where people are not quite 20
So well contented with the duke, as here.

Max. What now have they contrived to find out in him?
That he alone determines for himself
What he himself alone doth understand?
Well, therein he does right, and will persist in 't. 25
Heaven never meant him for that passive thing
That can be struck and hammered out to suit
Another's taste and fancy. He'll not dance
To every tune of every minister.
It goes against his nature&mdash;he can't do it. 30
He is possessed by a commanding spirit,
And his too is the station of command.
And well for us it is so! There exist
Few fit to rule themselves, but few that use
Their intellects intelligently.&mdash;Then 35
Well for the whole, if there be found a man,
Who makes himself what nature destined him,
The pause, the central point to thousand thousands&mdash;
Stands fixed and stately, like a firm-built column,
Where all may press with joy and confidence. 40
Now such a man is Wallenstein; and if
Another better suits the court&mdash;no other
But such a one as he can serve the army.

Questenberg. The army? Doubtless!

Octavio (aside). Hush! suppress it, friend!
Unless some end were answered by the utterance.&mdash; 45
Of him there you'll make nothing.

Max. In their distress
They call a spirit up, and when he comes,
Straight their flesh creeps and quivers, and they dread him
More than the ills for which they called him up.
The uncommon, the sublime, must seem and be 50
Like things of every day.&mdash;But in the field,
Aye, there the Present Being makes itself felt.
The personal must command, the actual eye
[613]
Examine. If to be the chieftain asks
All that is great in nature, let it be 55
Likewise his privilege to move and act
In all the correspondencies of greatness.
The oracle within him, that which lives,
He must invoke and question&mdash;not dead books,
Not ordinances, not mould-rotted papers. 60

Octavio. My son! of those old narrow ordinances
Let us not hold too lightly. They are weights
Of priceless value, which oppressed mankind
Tied to the volatile will of their oppressors.
For always formidable was the league 65
And partnership of free power with free will.
The way of ancient ordinance, though it winds,
Is yet no devious way. Straight forward goes
The lightning's path, and straight the fearful path
Of the cannon-ball. Direct it flies and rapid, 70
Shattering that it may reach, and shattering what it reaches.
My son! the road the human being travels,
That on which blessing comes and goes, doth follow
The river's course, the valley's playful windings,
Curves round the corn-field and the hill of vines, 75
Honouring the holy bounds of property!
And thus secure, though late, leads to its end.

Questenberg. O hear your father, noble youth! hear him,
Who is at once the hero and the man.

Octavio. My son, the nursling of the camp spoke in thee! 80
A war of fifteen years
Hath been thy education and thy school.
Peace hast thou never witnessed! There exists
A higher than the warrior's excellence.
In war itself war is no ultimate purpose. 85
The vast and sudden deeds of violence,
Adventures wild, and wonders of the moment,
These are not they, my son, that generate
The calm, the blissful, and the enduring mighty!
Lo there! the soldier, rapid architect! 90
Builds his light town of canvas, and at once
The whole scene moves and bustles momently,
With arms, and neighing steeds, and mirth and quarrel
The motley market fills; the roads, the streams
[614]
Are crowded with new freights, trade stirs and hurries! 95
But on some morrow morn, all suddenly,
The tents drop down, the horde renews its march.
Dreary, and solitary as a church-yard
The meadow and down-trodden seed-plot lie,
And the year's harvest is gone utterly. 100

Max. O let the Emperor make peace, my father!
Most gladly would I give the blood-stained laurel
For the first violet[614:1] of the leafless spring,
Plucked in those quiet fields where I have journeyed!

Octavio. What ails thee? What so moves thee all at once? 105

Max. Peace have I ne'er beheld? I have beheld it.
From thence am I come hither: O! that sight,
It glimmers still before me, like some landscape
Left in the distance,&mdash;some delicious landscape!
My road conducted me through countries where 110
The war has not yet reached. Life, life, my father&mdash;
My venerable father, life has charms
Which we have ne'er experienced. We have been
But voyaging along its barren coasts,
Like some poor ever-roaming horde of pirates, 115
That, crowded in the rank and narrow ship,
House on the wild sea with wild usages,
Nor know aught of the main land, but the bays
Where safeliest they may venture a thieves' landing.
Whate'er in the inland dales the land conceals 120
Of fair and exquisite, O! nothing, nothing,
Do we behold of that in our rude voyage.

Octavio. And so your journey has revealed this to you?

Max. 'Twas the first leisure of my life. O tell me,
What is the meed and purpose of the toil, 125
The painful toil, which robbed me of my youth,
Left me a heart unsoul'd and solitary,
A spirit uninformed, unornamented.
For the camp's stir and crowd and ceaseless larum,
The neighing war-horse, the air-shattering trumpet, 130
[615]
The unvaried, still-returning hour of duty,
Word of command, and exercise of arms&mdash;
There's nothing here, there's nothing in all this
To satisfy the heart, the gasping heart!
Mere bustling nothingness, where the soul is not&mdash; 135
This cannot be the sole felicity,
These cannot be man's best and only pleasures.

Octavio. Much hast thou learnt, my son, in this short journey.

Max. O! day thrice lovely! when at length the soldier
Returns home into life; when he becomes 140
A fellow-man among his fellow-men.
The colours are unfurled, the cavalcade
Marshals, and now the buzz is hushed, and hark!
Now the soft peace-march beats, home, brothers, home!
The caps and helmets are all garlanded 145
With green boughs, the last plundering of the fields.
The city gates fly open of themselves,
They need no longer the petard to tear them.
The ramparts are all filled with men and women,
With peaceful men and women, that send onwards 150
Kisses and welcomings upon the air,
Which they make breezy with affectionate gestures.
From all the towers rings out the merry peal,
The joyous vespers of a bloody day.
O happy man, O fortunate! for whom 155
The well-known door, the faithful arms are open,
The faithful tender arms with mute embracing.

Questenberg. O! that you should speak
Of such a distant, distant time, and not
Of the to-morrow, not of this to-day. 160

Max. Where lies the fault but on you in Vienna?
I will deal openly with you, Questenberg.
Just now, as first I saw you standing here,
(I'll own it to you freely) indignation
Crowded and pressed my inmost soul together. 165
'Tis ye that hinder peace, ye!&mdash;and the warrior,
It is the warrior that must force it from you.
Ye fret the General's life out, blacken him,
Hold him up as a rebel, and Heaven knows
What else still worse, because he spares the Saxons, 170
[616]
And tries to awaken confidence in the enemy;
Which yet 's the only way to peace: for if
War intermit not during war, how then
And whence can peace come?&mdash;Your own plagues fall on you!
Even as I love what's virtuous, hate I you. 175
And here make I this vow, here pledge myself;
My blood shall spurt out for this Wallenstein,
And my heart drain off, drop by drop, ere ye
Shall revel and dance jubilee o'er his ruin. [Exit.

Scene VI

Changes to a spacious chamber in the house of the Duke of
Friedland.&mdash;Servants employed in putting the tables and chairs in
order. During this enters Seni, like an old Italian doctor, in black,
and clothed somewhat fantastically. He carries a white staff, with which
he marks out the quarters of the heaven.


First Servant. Come&mdash;to it, lads, to it! Make an end of it.
I hear the sentry call out, 'Stand to your arms!' They will
be there in a minute.

Second Servant. Why were we not told before that the
audience would be held here? Nothing prepared&mdash;no orders&mdash;no 5
instructions&mdash;

Third Servant. Ay, and why was the balcony-chamber
countermanded, that with the great worked carpet?&mdash;there one can
look about one.

First Servant. Nay, that you must ask the mathematician there. 10
He says it is an unlucky chamber.

Second Servant. Poh! stuff and nonsense! That's what I call
a hum. A chamber is a chamber; what much can the place
signify in the affair?

Seni. My son, there's nothing insignificant, 15
Nothing! But yet in every earthly thing
First and most principal is place and time.

First Servant (to the Second). Say nothing to him, Nat. The
Duke himself must let him have his own will.

Seni (counts the chairs, half in a loud, half in a low voice, till he comes to eleven, which he repeats).
Eleven! an evil number! Set twelve chairs. 20
Twelve! twelve signs hath the zodiac: five and seven,
The holy numbers, include themselves in twelve.

Second Servant. And what may you have to object against
eleven? I should like to know that now.

[618]

Seni. Eleven is&mdash;transgression; eleven oversteps 25
The ten commandments.

Second Servant. That's good! and why do you call five an
holy number?

Seni. Five is the soul of man: for even as man
Is mingled up of good and evil, so 30
The five is the first number that's made up
Of even and odd.

Second Servant. The foolish old coxcomb!

First Servant. Ey! let him alone though. I like to hear
him; there is more in his words than can be seen at first sight. 35

Third Servant. Off! They come.

Scene VII

Wallenstein, Duchess.


Wallenstein. You went then through Vienna, were presented
To the Queen of Hungary?

Duchess. Yes, and to the Empress too,
And by both Majesties were we admitted
To kiss the hand.

Wallenstein. And how was it received,
That I had sent for wife and daughter hither 5
To the camp, in winter time?

Duchess. I did even that
Which you commissioned me to do. I told them,
You had determined on our daughter's marriage,
And wished, ere yet you went into the field,
To shew the elected husband his betrothed. 10

Wallenstein. And did they guess the choice which I had made?

Duchess. They only hoped and wished it may have fallen
Upon no foreign nor yet Lutheran noble.

Wallenstein. And you&mdash;what do you wish, Elizabeth?

Duchess. Your will, you know, was always mine.

Wallenstein. Well, then? 15
[619]
And in all else, of what kind and complexion
Was your reception at the court?
Hide nothing from me. How were you received?

Duchess. O! my dear lord, all is not what it was.
A cankerworm, my lord, a cankerworm 20
Has stolen into the bud.

Wallenstein. Ay! is it so!
What, they were lax? they failed of the old respect?

Duchess. Not of respect. No honours were omitted,
No outward courtesy; but in the place
Of condescending, confidential kindness, 25
Familiar and endearing, there were given me
Only these honours and that solemn courtesy.
Ah! and the tenderness which was put on,
It was the guise of pity, not of favour.
No! Albrecht's wife, Duke Albrecht's princely wife, 30
Count Harrach's noble daughter, should not so&mdash;
Not wholly so should she have been received.

Wallenstein. Yes, yes; they have ta'en offence. My latest conduct,
They railed at it, no doubt.

Duchess. O that they had!
I have been long accustomed to defend you, 35
To heal and pacify distempered spirits.
No; no one railed at you. They wrapped them up,
O Heaven! in such oppressive, solemn silence!&mdash;
Here is no every-day misunderstanding,
No transient pique, no cloud that passes over; 40
Something most luckless, most unhealable,
Has taken place. The Queen of Hungary
Used formerly to call me her dear aunt,
And ever at departure to embrace me&mdash;

Wallenstein. Now she omitted it?

Duchess. She did embrace me, 45
But then first when I had already taken
My formal leave, and when the door already
Had closed upon me, then did she come out
In haste, as she had suddenly bethought herself,
And pressed me to her bosom, more with anguish 50
Than tenderness.


[620]


Wallenstein (seizes her hand soothingly). Nay, now collect yourself,
And what of Eggenberg and Lichtenstein,
And of our other friends there?

Duchess. I saw none.

Wallenstein. The Ambassador from Spain, who once was wont
To plead so warmly for me?&mdash;

Duchess. Silent, Silent! 55

Wallenstein. These suns then are eclipsed for us. Henceforward
Must we roll on, our own fire, our own light.

Duchess. And were it&mdash;were it, my dear lord, in that
Which moved about the court in buzz and whisper,
But in the country let itself be heard 60
Aloud&mdash;in that which Father Lamormain
In sundry hints and&mdash;&mdash;

Wallenstein. Lamormain! what said he?

Duchess. That you're accused of having daringly
O'erstepped the powers entrusted to you, charged
With traitorous contempt of the Emperor 65
And his supreme behests. The proud Bavarian,
He and the Spaniards stand up your accusers&mdash;
That there's a storm collecting over you
Of far more fearful menace than that former one
Which whirled you headlong down at Regensburg. 70
And people talk, said he, of&mdash;&mdash;Ah!&mdash;

Wallenstein. Proceed!

Duchess. I cannot utter it!

Wallenstein. Proceed!

Duchess. They talk&mdash;&mdash;

Wallenstein. Well!

Duchess. Of a second&mdash;&mdash;

Wallenstein. Second&mdash;&mdash;

Duchess. More disgraceful
&mdash;&mdash;Dismission.

Wallenstein. Talk they?
O! they force, they thrust me
[621]
With violence, against my own will, onward! 75

Duchess. O! if there yet be time, my husband! if
By giving way and by submission, this
Can be averted&mdash;my dear lord, give way!
Win down your proud heart to it! Tell that heart
It is your sovereign lord, your Emperor 80
Before whom you retreat. O let no longer
Low tricking malice blacken your good meaning
With abhorred venomous glosses. Stand you up
Shielded and helm'd and weapon'd with the truth,
And drive before you into uttermost shame 85
These slanderous liars! Few firm friends have we&mdash;
You know it!&mdash;The swift growth of our good fortune
It hath but set us up, a mark for hatred.
What are we, if the sovereign's grace and favour
Stand not before us? 90

Enter the Countess Tertsky, leading in her hand the Princess Thekla,
richly adorned with brilliants.

Countess, Thekla, Wallenstein, Duchess.


Countess. How, sister? What already upon business,
And business of no pleasing kind I see,
Ere he has gladdened at his child. The first
Moment belongs to joy. Here, Friedland! father!
This is thy daughter. 5


(Thekla approaches with a shy and timid air, and bends herself as about
to kiss his hand. He receives her in his arms, and remains standing for
some time lost in the feeling of her presence.)


Wallenstein. Yes! pure and lovely hath hope risen on me:
I take her as the pledge of greater fortune.

Duchess. 'Twas but a little child when you departed
To raise up that great army for the Emperor:
And after, at the close of the campaign, 10
When you returned home out of Pomerania,
Your daughter was already in the convent,
Wherein she has remain'd till now.

Wallenstein. The while
[622]
We in the field here gave our cares and toils
To make her great, and fight her a free way 15
To the loftiest earthly good, lo! mother Nature
Within the peaceful silent convent walls
Has done her part, and out of her free grace
Hath she bestowed on the beloved child
The godlike; and now leads her thus adorned 20
To meet her splendid fortune, and my hope.

Duchess (to Thekla). Thou wouldst not have recognized thy father,
Wouldst thou, my child? She counted scarce eight years,
When last she saw your face.

Thekla. O yes, yes, mother!
At the first glance!&mdash;My father is not altered. 25
The form, that stands before me, falsifies
No feature of the image that hath lived
So long within me!

Wallenstein. The voice of my child!
[Then after a pause.
I was indignant at my destiny
That it denied me a man-child to be 30
Heir of my name and of my prosperous fortune,
And re-illume my soon extinguished being
In a proud line of princes.
I wronged my destiny. Here upon this head
So lovely in its maiden bloom will I 35
Let fall the garland of a life of war,
Nor deem it lost, if only I can wreath it
Transmitted to a regal ornament,
Around these beauteous brows.

Enter Max Piccolomini, and some time after Count Tertsky, the others
remaining as before.


Countess. There comes the Paladin who protected us.

Wallenstein. Max! Welcome, ever welcome! Always wert thou
The morning star of my best joys!

Max. My General&mdash;&mdash;

Wallenstein. 'Till now it was the Emperor who rewarded thee,
I but the instrument. This day thou hast bound 5
[623]
The father to thee, Max! the fortunate father,
And this debt Friedland's self must pay.

Max. My prince!
You made no common hurry to transfer it.
I come with shame: yea, not without a pang!
For scarce have I arrived here, scarce delivered 10
The mother and the daughter to your arms,
But there is brought to me from your equerry
A splendid richly-plated hunting dress
So to remunerate me for my troubles&mdash;&mdash;
Yes, yes, remunerate me! Since a trouble 15
It must be, a mere office, not a favour
Which I leapt forward to receive, and which
I came already with full heart to thank you for.
No! 'twas not so intended, that my business
Should be my highest best good fortune! 20


[Tertsky enters, and delivers letters to the Duke, which he breaks open
hurryingly.


Countess (to Max). Remunerate your trouble! For his joy
He makes you recompense. 'Tis not unfitting
For you, Count Piccolomini, to feel
So tenderly&mdash;my brother it beseems
To shew himself for ever great and princely. 25

Thekla. Then I too must have scruples of his love:
For his munificent hands did ornament me
Ere yet the father's heart had spoken to me.

Max. Yes; 'tis his nature ever to be giving
And making happy.
How my heart pours out 30
Its all of thanks to him: O! how I seem
To utter all things in the dear name Friedland.
While I shall live, so long will I remain
The captive of this name: in it shall bloom
My every fortune, every lovely hope. 35
Inextricably as in some magic ring
In this name hath my destiny charm-bound me!

Countess. My brother wishes us to leave him. Come.

Wallenstein (turns himself round quick, collects himself, and speaks with cheerfulness to the Duchess). Once more I bid thee welcome to the camp,
[624]
Thou art the hostess of this court. You, Max, 40
Will now again administer your old office,
While we perform the sovereign's business here.

Scene X

Wallenstein, Count Tertsky.


Wallenstein (to himself). She hath seen all things as they are&mdash;It is so
And squares completely with my other notices.
They have determined finally in Vienna,
Have given me my successor already;
It is the king of Hungary, Ferdinand, 5
The Emperor's delicate son! he's now their saviour,
He's the new star that's rising now! Of us
They think themselves already fairly rid,
And as we were deceased, the heir already
Is entering on possession&mdash;Therefore&mdash;dispatch! 10
[As he turns round he observes Tertsky, and gives him a letter.
Count Altringer will have himself excused,
And Galas too&mdash;I like not this!

Tertsky. And if
Thou loiterest longer, all will fall away,
One following the other.

Wallenstein. Altringer
Is master of the Tyrole passes. I must forthwith 15
Send some one to him, that he let not in
The Spaniards on me from the Milanese.
&mdash;&mdash;Well, and the old Sesin, that ancient trader
In contraband negotiations, he
Has shewn himself again of late. What brings he 20
From the Count Thur?

Tertsky. The Count communicates,
He has found out the Swedish chancellor
At Halberstadt, where the convention's held,
Who says, you've tired him out, and that he'll have
[625]
No further dealings with you.

Wallenstein. And why so? 25

[625:1]Tertsky. He says, you are never in earnest in your speeches,
That you decoy the Swedes&mdash;to make fools of them,
Will league yourself with Saxony against them,
And at last make yourself a riddance of them
With a paltry sum of money.

Wallenstein. So then, doubtless, 30
Yes, doubtless, this same modest Swede expects
That I shall yield him some fair German tract
For his prey and booty, that ourselves at last
On our own soil and native territory,
May be no longer our own lords and masters! 35
An excellent scheme! No, no! They must be off,
Off, off! away! we want no such neighbours.

Tertsky. Nay, yield them up that dot, that speck of land&mdash;
It goes not from your portion. If you win
The game what matters it to you who pays it? 40

Wallenstein. Off with them, off! Thou understand'st not this.
Never shall it be said of me, I parcelled
My native land away, dismembered Germany,
Betrayed it to a foreigner, in order
To come with stealthy tread, and filch away 45
My own share of the plunder&mdash;Never! never!&mdash;
No foreign power shall strike root in the empire,
And least of all, these Goths! these hunger-wolves!
Who send such envious, hot and greedy glances
[626]
T'wards the rich blessings of our German lands! 50
I'll have their aid to cast and draw my nets,
But not a single fish of all the draught
Shall they come in for.

Tertsky. You will deal, however,
More fairly with the Saxons? They lose patience
While you shift ground and make so many curves. 55
Say, to what purpose all these masks? Your friends
Are plunged in doubts, baffled, and led astray in you.
There's Oxenstirn, there's Arnheim&mdash;neither knows
What he should think of your procrastinations.
And in the end I prove the liar: all 60
Passes through me. I have not even your hand-writing.

Wallenstein. I never give my handwriting; thou knowest it.

Tertsky. But how can it be known that you're in earnest,
If the act follows not upon the word?
You must yourself acknowledge, that in all 65
Your intercourses hitherto with the enemy
You might have done with safety all you have done,
Had you meant nothing further than to gull him
For the Emperor's service.

Wallenstein (after a pause, during which he looks narrowly on Tertsky).
And from whence dost thou know
That I'm not gulling him for the Emperor's service? 70
Whence knowest thou that I'm not gulling all of you?
Dost thou know me so well? When made I thee
The intendant of my secret purposes?
I am not conscious that I ever open'd
My inmost thoughts to thee. The Emperor, it is true, 75
Hath dealt with me amiss; and if I would,
I could repay him with usurious interest
For the evil he hath done me. It delights me
To know my power; but whether I shall use it,
Of that, I should have thought that thou could'st speak 80
No wiselier than thy fellows.

Tertsky. So hast thou always played thy game with us.


[Enter Illo.



FOOTNOTES:

[625:1] This passing off of his real irresolution and
fancy-dalliance for depth of Reserve and for Plan formed within the
magic circle of his own inapproachable spirits is very fine; but still
it is not tragic&mdash;nay scarce obvious enough to be altogether dramatic,
if in this word we involve theatre-representation. Iago (so far only
analogous to Wallenstein as in him an Impulse is the source of his
conduct rather than the motive), always acting is not the object of
Interest, [but] derives a constant interest from Othello, on whom he is
acting; from Desdemona, Cassio, every one; and, besides, for the purpose
of theatric comprehensibility he is furnished with a set of outside
motives that actually pass with the groundling for the true springs of
action. MS. R.

Illo, Wallenstein, Tertsky.


Wallenstein. How stand affairs without? Are they prepared?

Illo. You'll find them in the very mood you wish.
They know about the Emperor's requisitions,
And are tumultuous.

Wallenstein. How hath Isolan
Declared himself?

Illo. He's yours, both soul and body, 5
Since you built up again his Faro-bank.

Wallenstein. And which way doth Kolatto bend? Hast thou
Made sure of Tiefenbach and Deodate?

Illo. What Piccolomini does, that they do too.

Wallenstein. You mean then I may venture somewhat with them? 10

Illo.&mdash;If you are assured of the Piccolomini.

Wallenstein. Not more assured of mine own self.

Tertsky. And yet
I would you trusted not so much to Octavio,
The fox!

Wallenstein. Thou teachest me to know my man?
Sixteen campaigns I have made with that old warrior. 15
Besides, I have his horoscope,
We both are born beneath like stars&mdash;in short
To this belongs its own particular aspect,
If therefore thou canst warrant me the rest&mdash;&mdash;

Illo. There is among them all but this one voice, 20
You must not lay down the command. I hear
They mean to send a deputation to you.

Wallenstein. If I'm in aught to bind myself to them,
They too must bind themselves to me.

Illo. Of course.

Wallenstein. Their words of honour they must give, their oaths, 25
Give them in writing to me, promising
Devotion to my service unconditional.


[628]


Illo. Why not?

Tertsky. Devotion unconditional?
The exception of their duties towards Austria
They'll always place among the premises. 30
With this reserve&mdash;&mdash;

Wallenstein. All unconditional!
No premises, no reserves.

Illo. A thought has struck me.
Does not Count Tertsky give us a set banquet
This evening?

Tertsky. Yes; and all the Generals
Have been invited.

Illo (to Wallenstein). Say, will you here fully 35
Commission me to use my own discretion?
I'll gain for you the Generals' words of honour,
Even as you wish.

Wallenstein. Gain me their signatures!
How you come by them, that is your concern.

Illo. And if I bring it to you, black on white, 40
That all the leaders who are present here
Give themselves up to you, without condition;
Say, will you then&mdash;then will you shew yourself
In earnest, and with some decisive action
Make trial of your luck?

Wallenstein. The signatures! 45
Gain me the signatures.

Illo. [628:1]Seize, seize the hour
Ere it slips from you. Seldom comes the moment
In life, which is indeed sublime and weighty.
To make a great decision possible,
O! many things, all transient and all rapid, 50
Must meet at once: and, haply, they thus met
May by that confluence be enforced to pause
Time long enough for wisdom, though too short,
Far, far too short a time for doubt and scruple!
This is that moment. See, our army chieftains, 55
Our best, our noblest, are assembled around you,
[629]
Their kinglike leader! On your nod they wait.
The single threads, which here your prosperous fortune
Hath woven together in one potent web
Instinct with destiny, O let them not 60
Unravel of themselves. If you permit
These chiefs to separate, so unanimous
Bring you them not a second time together.
'Tis the high tide that heaves the stranded ship,
And every individual's spirit waxes 65
In the great stream of multitudes. Behold
They are still here, here still! But soon the war
Bursts them once more asunder, and in small
Particular anxieties and interests
Scatters their spirit, and the sympathy 70
Of each man with the whole. He, who to-day
Forgets himself, forced onward with the stream,
Will become sober, seeing but himself,
Feel only his own weakness, and with speed
Will face about, and march on in the old 75
High road of duty, the old broad-trodden road,
And seek but to make shelter in good plight.

Wallenstein. The time is not yet come.

Tertsky. So you say always.
But when will it be time?

Wallenstein. When I shall say it.

Illo. You'll wait upon the stars, and on their hours, 80
Till the earthly hour escapes you. O, believe me,
In your own bosom are your destiny's stars.
Confidence in yourself, prompt resolution,
This is your Venus! and the sole malignant,
The only one that harmeth you is Doubt. 85

Wallenstein. Thou speakest as thou understand'st. How oft
And many a time I've told thee, Jupiter,
That lustrous god, was setting at thy birth.
Thy visual power subdues no mysteries;
Mole-eyed, thou mayest but burrow in the earth, 90
[629:1]Blind as that subterrestrial, who with wan,
[630]
Lead-coloured shine lighted thee into life.
The common, the terrestrial, thou mayest see,
With serviceable cunning knit together
The nearest with the nearest; and therein 95
I trust thee and believe thee! but whate'er
Full of mysterious import Nature weaves,
And fashions in the depths&mdash;the spirit's ladder,
That from this gross and visible world of dust
Even to the starry world, with thousand rounds, 100
Builds itself up; on which the unseen powers
Move up and down on heavenly ministries&mdash;
The circles in the circles, that approach
The central sun with ever-narrowing orbit&mdash;
These see the glance alone, the unsealed eye, 105
Of Jupiter's glad children born in lustre.
[He walks across the chamber, then returns, and standing still, proceeds.
The heavenly constellations make not merely
The day and nights, summer and spring, not merely
Signify to the husbandman the seasons
Of sowing and of harvest. Human action, 110
That is the seed too of contingencies,
Strewed on the dark land of futurity
In hopes to reconcile the powers of fate.
Whence it behoves us to seek out the seed-time,
To watch the stars, select their proper hours, 115
And trace with searching eye the heavenly houses,
Whether the enemy of growth and thriving
Hide himself not, malignant, in his corner.
Therefore permit me my own time. Meanwhile
Do you your part. As yet I cannot say 120
What I shall do&mdash;only, give way I will not.
Depose me too they shall not. On these points
You may rely.

Scene XII

Wallenstein, Tertsky, Illo.&mdash;To them enter Questenberg, Octavio, and
Max Piccolomini, Butler, Isolani, Maradas, and three other Generals.
Wallenstein motions Questenberg, who in consequence takes the Chair
directly opposite to him; the others follow, arranging themselves
according to their rank.


Wallenstein. I have understood, 'tis true, the sum and import
Of your instructions, Questenberg, have weighed them,
And formed my final, absolute resolve;
Yet it seems fitting, that the Generals
Should hear the will of the Emperor from your mouth. 5
May't please you then to open your commission
Before these noble Chieftains.

Questenberg. I am ready
To obey you; but will first entreat your Highness,
And all these noble Chieftains, to consider,
The Imperial dignity and sovereign right 10
Speaks from my mouth, and not my own presumption.

Wallenstein. We excuse all preface.

Questenberg. When his Majesty
The Emperor to his courageous armies
Presented in the person of Duke Friedland
A most experienced and renowned commander, 15
He did it in glad hope and confidence
To give thereby to the fortune of the war
A rapid and auspicious change. The onset
Was favourable to his royal wishes.
Bohemia was delivered from the Saxons, 20
The Swede's career of conquest checked! These lands
Began to draw breath freely, as Duke Friedland
From all the streams of Germany forced hither
The scattered armies of the enemy,
Hither invoked as round one magic circle 25
The Rhinegrave, Bernhard, Banner, Oxenstirn,
Yea, and that never-conquered King himself;
Here finally, before the eye of N&uuml;rnberg,
The fearful game of battle to decide.

Wallenstein. May't please you to the point. 30


[632]


Questenberg. In N&uuml;rnberg's camp the Swedish monarch left
His fame&mdash;in L&uuml;tzen's plains his life. But who
Stood not astounded, when victorious Friedland
After this day of triumph, this proud day,
Marched toward Bohemia with the speed of flight, 35
And vanished from the theatre of war;
While the young Weimar hero forced his way
Into Franconia, to the Danube, like
Some delving winter-stream, which, where it rushes,
Makes its own channel; with such sudden speed 40
He marched, and now at once 'fore Regenspurg
Stood to the affright of all good Catholic Christians.
Then did Bavaria's well-deserving Prince
Entreat swift aidance in his extreme need;
The Emperor sends seven horsemen to Duke Friedland, 45
Seven horsemen couriers sends he with the entreaty:
He superadds his own, and supplicates
Where as the sovereign lord he can command.
In vain his supplication! At this moment
The Duke hears only his old hate and grudge, 50
Barters the general good to gratify
Private revenge&mdash;and so falls Regenspurg.

Wallenstein. Max, to what period of the war alludes he?
My recollection fails me here.

Max. He means
When we were in Silesia.

Wallenstein. Ay! Is it so! 55
But what had we to do there?

Max. To beat out
The Swedes and Saxons from the province.

Wallenstein. True.
In that description which the Minister gave
I seemed to have forgotten the whole war.
[To Questenberg.
Well, but proceed a little.

Questenberg. Yes! at length 60
Beside the river Oder did the Duke
Assert his ancient fame. Upon the fields
Of Steinau did the Swedes lay down their arms,
Subdued without a blow. And here, with others,
The righteousness of Heaven to his avenger 65
Delivered that long-practised stirrer-up
[633]
Of insurrection, that curse-laden torch
And kindler of this war, Matthias Thur.
But he had fallen into magnanimous hands;
Instead of punishment he found reward, 70
And with rich presents did the Duke dismiss
The arch-foe of his Emperor.

Wallenstein (laughs). I know,
I know you had already in Vienna
Your windows and balconies all forestalled
To see him on the executioner's cart. 75
I might have lost the battle, lost it too
With infamy, and still retained your graces&mdash;
But, to have cheated them of a spectacle,
Oh! that the good folks of Vienna never,
No, never can forgive me.

Questenberg. So Silesia 80
Was freed, and all things loudly called the Duke
Into Bavaria, now pressed hard on all sides.
And he did put his troops in motion: slowly,
Quite at his ease, and by the longest road
He traverses Bohemia; but ere ever 85
He hath once seen the enemy, faces round,
Breaks up the march, and takes to winter quarters.

Wallenstein. The troops were pitiably destitute
Of every necessary, every comfort.
The winter came. What thinks his Majesty 90
His troops are made of? Arn't we men? subjected
Like other men to wet, and cold, and all
The circumstances of necessity?
O miserable lot of the poor soldier!
Wherever he comes in, all flee before him, 95
And when he goes away, the general curse
Follows him on his route. All must be seized,
Nothing is given him. And compelled to seize
From every man, he's every man's abhorrence.
Behold, here stand my Generals. Karaffa! 100
Count Deodate! Butler! Tell this man
How long the soldiers' pay is in arrears.

Butler. Already a full year.

Wallenstein. And 'tis the hire
That constitutes the hireling's name and duties,
[634]
The soldier's pay is the soldier's covenant.[634:1] 105

Questenberg. Ah! this is a far other tone from that
In which the Duke spoke eight, nine years ago.

Wallenstein. Yes! 'tis my fault, I know it: I myself
Have spoilt the Emperor by indulging him.
Nine years ago, during the Danish war, 110
I raised him up a force, a mighty force,
Forty or fifty thousand men, that cost him
Of his own purse no doit. Through Saxony
The fury goddess of the war marched on,
E'en to the surf-rocks of the Baltic, bearing 115
The terrors of his name. That was a time!
In the whole Imperial realm no name like mine
Honoured with festival and celebration&mdash;
And Albrecht Wallenstein, it was the title
Of the third jewel in his crown! 120
But at the Diet, when the Princes met
At Regenspurg, there, there the whole broke out,
There 'twas laid open, there it was made known,
Out of what money-bag I had paid the host.
And what was now my thank, what had I now, 125
That I, a faithful servant of the Sovereign,
Had loaded on myself the people's curses,
And let the Princes of the empire pay
The expenses of this war, that aggrandizes
The Emperor alone&mdash;What thanks had I! 130
What? I was offered up to their complaints,
Dismissed, degraded!

Questenberg. But your Highness knows
What little freedom he possessed of action
In that disastrous diet.

Wallenstein. Death and hell!
I had that which could have procured him freedom. 135
No! Since 'twas proved so inauspicious to me
[635]
To serve the Emperor at the empire's cost,
I have been taught far other trains of thinking
Of the empire, and the diet of the empire.
From the Emperor, doubtless, I received this staff, 140
But now I hold it as the empire's general&mdash;
For the common weal, the universal interest,
And no more for that one man's aggrandizement!
But to the point. What is it that's desired of me?

Questenberg. First, his imperial Majesty hath willed 145
That without pretexts of delay the army
Evacuate Bohemia.

Wallenstein. In this season?
And to what quarter wills the Emperor
That we direct our course?

Questenberg. To the enemy.
His Majesty resolves, that Regenspurg 150
Be purified from the enemy, ere Easter,
That Lutheranism may be no longer preached
In that cathedral, nor heretical
Defilement desecrate the celebration
Of that pure festival.

Wallenstein. My generals, 155
Can this be realized?

Illo. 'Tis not possible.

Butler. It can't be realized.

Questenberg. The Emperor
Already hath commanded Colonel Suys
To advance toward Bavaria!

Wallenstein. What did Suys?

Questenberg. That which his duty prompted. He advanced! 160

Wallenstein. What? he advanced? And I, his general,
Had given him orders, peremptory orders,
Not to desert his station! Stands it thus
With my authority? Is this the obedience
Due to my office, which being thrown aside 165
No war can be conducted? Chieftains, speak!
You be the judges, generals! What deserves
That officer, who of his oath neglectful
Is guilty of contempt of orders?

Illo. Death.

Wallenstein. Count Piccolomini! what has he deserved? 170


[636]


Max Piccolomini. According to the letter of the law,
Death.

Isolani. Death.

Butler. Death, by the laws of war.


[Questenberg rises from his seat, Wallenstein follows; all the rest
rise.


Wallenstein. To this the law condemns him, and not I.
And if I shew him favour, 'twill arise
From the reverence that I owe my Emperor. 175

Questenberg. If so, I can say nothing further&mdash;here!

Wallenstein. I accepted the command but on conditions!
And this the first, that to the diminution
Of my authority no human being,
Not even the Emperor's self, should be entitled 180
To do aught, or to say aught, with the army.
If I stand warranter of the event,
Placing my honour and my head in pledge,
Needs must I have full mastery in all
The means thereto. What rendered this Gustavus 185
Resistless, and unconquered upon earth?
This&mdash;that he was the monarch in his army!
A monarch, one who is indeed a monarch,
Was never yet subdued but by his equal.
But to the point! The best is yet to come. 190
Attend now, generals!

Questenberg. The prince Cardinal
Begins his route at the approach of spring
From the Milanese; and leads a Spanish army
Through Germany into the Netherlands.
That he may march secure and unimpeded, 195
'Tis the Emperor's will you grant him a detachment
Of eight horse-regiments from the army here.

Wallenstein. Yes, yes! I understand!&mdash;Eight regiments! Well,
Right well concerted, father Lamormain!
Eight thousand horse! Yes, yes! 'Tis as it should be! 200
I see it coming!

Questenberg. There is nothing coming.
All stands in front: the counsel of state-prudence,
The dictate of necessity!&mdash;&mdash;

Wallenstein. What then?
What, my Lord Envoy? May I not be suffered
[637]
To understand, that folks are tired of seeing 205
The sword's hilt in my grasp: and that your court
Snatch eagerly at this pretence, and use
The Spanish title, to drain off my forces,
To lead into the empire a new army
Unsubjected to my control. To throw me 210
Plumply aside,&mdash;I am still too powerful for you
To venture that. My stipulation runs,
That all the Imperial forces shall obey me
Where'er the German is the native language.
Of Spanish troops and of Prince Cardinals 215
That take their route, as visitors, through the empire,
There stands no syllable in my stipulation.
No syllable! And so the politic court
Steals in a-tiptoe, and creeps round behind it;
First makes me weaker, then to be dispensed with, 220
Till it dares strike at length a bolder blow
And make short work with me.
What need of all these crooked ways, Lord Envoy?
Straight-forward man! His compact with me pinches
The Emperor. He would that I moved off!&mdash; 225
Well!&mdash;I will gratify him!

[Here there commences an agitation among
the Generals which increases continually.

It grieves me for my noble officers' sakes!
I see not yet, by what means they will come at
The moneys they have advanced, or how obtain
The recompense their services demand. 230
Still a new leader brings new claimants forward,
And prior merit superannuates quickly.
There serve here many foreigners in the army,
And were the man in all else brave and gallant,
I was not wont to make nice scrutiny 235
After his pedigree or catechism.
This will be otherwise, i'the time to come.
Well&mdash;me no longer it concerns. [He seats himself.

Max Piccolomini. Forbid it. Heaven, that it should come to this!
Our troops will swell in dreadful fermentation&mdash; 240
The Emperor is abused&mdash;it cannot be.

Isolani. It cannot be; all goes to instant wreck.

Wallenstein. Thou hast said truly, faithful Isolani!
[638]
What we with toil and foresight have built up,
Will go to wreck&mdash;all go to instant wreck. 245
What then? another chieftain is soon found,
Another army likewise (who dares doubt it?)
Will flock from all sides to the Emperor
At the first beat of his recruiting drum.


[During this speech, Isolani, Tertsky, Illo and Maradas talk confusedly
with great agitation.


Max Piccolomini (busily and passionately going from one to
another, and soothing them). Hear, my commander! Hear me, generals! 250
Let me conjure you, Duke! Determine nothing,
Till we have met and represented to you
Our joint remonstrances.&mdash;Nay, calmer! Friends!
I hope all may be yet set right again.

Tertsky. Away! let us away! in the antechamber 255
Find we the others.  [They go.

Butler (to Questenberg). If good counsel gain
Due audience from your wisdom, my Lord Envoy!
You will be cautious how you shew yourself
In public for some hours to come&mdash;or hardly
Will that gold key protect you from maltreatment. 260


[Commotions heard from without.


Wallenstein. A salutary counsel&mdash;&mdash;Thou, Octavio!
Wilt answer for the safety of our guest.
Farewell, Von Questenberg! [Questenberg is about to speak.
Nay, not a word.
Not one word more of that detested subject!
You have performed your duty&mdash;We know how 265
To separate the office from the man.


[As Questenberg is going off with Octavio, Goetz, Tiefenbach, Kolatto,
press in; several other Generals following them.


Goetz. Where's he who means to rob us of our general?

Tiefenbach (at the same time). What are we forced to hear?
That thou wilt leave us?

Kolatto (at the same time). We will live with thee, we will die with thee.

Wallenstein (pointing to Illo). There! the Field-Marshal knows our will. [Exit. 270

ACT II

Scene I

Scene&mdash;A small Chamber.

Illo and Tertsky.


Tertsky. Now for this evening's business! How intend you
To manage with the generals at the banquet?

Illo. Attend! We frame a formal declaration,
Wherein we to the Duke consign ourselves
Collectively, to be and to remain 5
His both with life and limb, and not to spare
The last drop of our blood for him, provided
So doing we infringe no oath nor duty,
We may be under to the Emperor.&mdash;Mark!
This reservation we expressly make 10
In a particular clause, and save the conscience.
Now hear! This formula so framed and worded
Will be presented to them for perusal
Before the banquet. No one will find in it
Cause of offence or scruple. Hear now further! 15
After the feast, when now the vap'ring wine
Opens the heart, and shuts the eyes, we let
A counterfeited paper, in the which
This one particular clause has been left out,
Go round for signatures.

Tertsky. How? think you then 20
That they'll believe themselves bound by an oath,
Which we had tricked them into by a juggle?

Illo. We shall have caught and caged them! Let them then
Beat their wings bare against the wires, and rave
Loud as they may against our treachery, 25
At court their signatures will be believed
Far more than their most holy affirmations.
Traitors they are, and must be; therefore wisely
Will make a virtue of necessity.

Tertsky. Well, well, it shall content me; let but something 30
Be done, let only some decisive blow
Set us in motion.

Illo. Besides, 'tis of subordinate importance
[640]
How, or how far, we may thereby propel
The generals. 'Tis enough that we persuade 35
The Duke, that they are his&mdash;Let him but act
In his determined mood, as if he had them,
And he will have them. Where he plunges in,
He makes a whirlpool, and all stream down to it.

Tertsky. His policy is such a labyrinth, 40
That many a time when I have thought myself
Close at his side, he's gone at once, and left me
Ignorant of the ground where I was standing.
He lends the enemy his ear, permits me
To write to them, to Arnheim; to Sesina 45
Himself comes forward blank and undisguised;
Talks with us by the hour about his plans,
And when I think I have him&mdash;off at once&mdash;&mdash;
He has slipped from me, and appears as if
He had no scheme, but to retain his place. 50

Illo. He give up his old plans! I'll tell you, friend!
His soul is occupied with nothing else,
Even in his sleep&mdash;They are his thoughts, his dreams,
That day by day he questions for this purpose
The motions of the planets&mdash;&mdash;

Tertsky. Ay! you know 55
This night, that is now coming, he with Seni
Shuts himself up in the astrological tower
To make joint observations&mdash;for I hear,
It is to be a night of weight and crisis;
And something great, and of long expectation, 60
Is to make its procession in the heaven.

Illo. Come! be we bold and make dispatch. The work
In this next day or two must thrive and grow
More than it has for years. And let but only
Things first turn up auspicious here below&mdash;&mdash; 65
Mark what I say&mdash;the right stars too will shew themselves.
Come, to the generals. All is in the glow,
And must be beaten while 'tis malleable.

Tertsky. Do you go thither, Illo. I must stay
And wait here for the Countess Tertsky. Know 70
That we too are not idle. Break one string,
A second is in readiness.

Illo. Yes! Yes!
[641]
I saw your Lady smile with such sly meaning.
What's in the wind?

Tertsky. A secret. Hush! she comes. [Exit Illo.

Scene II

The Countess steps out from a Closet.

Count and Countess Tertsky.


Tertsky. Well&mdash;is she coming?&mdash;I can keep him back
No longer.

Countess. She will be there instantly.
You only send him.

Tertsky. I am not quite certain,
I must confess it, Countess, whether or not
We are earning the Duke's thanks hereby. You know, 5
No ray has broken from him on this point.
You have o'er-ruled me, and yourself know best
How far you dare proceed.

Countess. I take it on me.
[Talking to herself, while she is advancing.
Here's no need of full powers and commissions&mdash;
My cloudy Duke! we understand each other&mdash; 10
And without words. What, could I not unriddle,
Wherefore the daughter should be sent for hither,
Why first he, and no other, should be chosen
To fetch her hither! This sham of betrothing her
To a bridegroom,[641:1] whom no one knows&mdash;No! no!&mdash;-- 15
This may blind others! I see through thee, Brother!
But it beseems thee not, to draw a card
At such a game. Not yet!&mdash;It all remains
Mutely delivered up to my finessing&mdash;&mdash;
Well&mdash;thou shalt not have been deceived, Duke Friedland!
In her who is thy sister.&mdash;&mdash; 20

Servant (enters). The commanders!

Tertsky (to the Countess). Take care you heat his fancy and affections&mdash;
Possess him with a reverie, and send him,
Absent and dreaming, to the banquet; that
He may not boggle at the signature. 25


[642]


Countess. Take you care of your guests!&mdash;Go, send him hither.

Tertsky. All rests upon his undersigning.

Countess. Go to your guests! Go&mdash;&mdash;

Illo (comes back). Where art staying, Tertsky?
The house is full, and all expecting you. 30

Tertsky. Instantly! Instantly! [To the Countess.
And let him not
Stay here too long. It might awake suspicion
In the old man&mdash;&mdash;

Countess. A truce with your precautions!


[Exeunt Tertsky and Illo.

Scene III

Countess, Max Piccolomini.


Max. Aunt Tertsky? may I venture?
[Advances to the middle of the stage, and looks around him with uneasiness.
She's not here!
Where is she?

Countess. Look but somewhat narrowly
In yonder corner, lest perhaps she lie
Conceal'd behind that screen.

Max. There lie her gloves![642:1]
[Snatches at them, but the Countess takes them herself.
You unkind Lady! You refuse me this&mdash; 5
You make it an amusement to torment me.

Countess. And this the thanks you give me for my trouble?

Max. O, if you felt the oppression at my heart!
Since we've been here, so to constrain myself&mdash;
With such poor stealth to hazard words and glances&mdash; 10
These, these are not my habits!

Countess. You have still
Many new habits to acquire, young friend!
[643]
But on this proof of your obedient temper
I must continue to insist; and only
On this condition can I play the agent 15
For your concerns.

Max. But wherefore comes she not?
Where is she?

Countess. Into my hands you must place it
Whole and entire. Whom could you find, indeed,
More zealously affected to your interest?
No soul on earth must know it&mdash;not your father. 20
He must not above all.

Max. Alas! what danger?
Here is no face on which I might concentre
All the enraptured soul stirs up within me.
O Lady! tell me. Is all changed around me?
Or is it only I?
I find myself, 25
As among strangers! Not a trace is left
Of all my former wishes, former joys.
Where has it vanished to? There was a time
When even, methought, with such a world as this
I was not discontented. Now how flat! 30
How stale! No life, no bloom, no flavour in it!
My comrades are intolerable to me.
My father&mdash;Even to him I can say nothing.
My arms, my military duties&mdash;O!
They are such wearying toys!

Countess. But, gentle friend! 35
I must entreat it of your condescension,
You would be pleased to sink your eye, and favour
With one short glance or two this poor stale world,
Where even now much, and of much moment,
Is on the eve of its completion.

Max. Something, 40
I can't but know, is going forward round me.
I see it gathering, crowding, driving on,
In wild uncustomary movements. Well,
In due time, doubtless, it will reach even me.
Where think you I have been, dear lady? Nay, 45
No raillery. The turmoil of the camp,
The spring-tide of acquaintance rolling in,
The pointless jest, the empty conversation,
[644]
Oppress'd and stifled me. I gasped for air&mdash;
I could not breathe&mdash;I was constrain'd to fly, 50
To seek a silence out for my full heart;
And a pure spot wherein to feel my happiness.
No smiling, Countess! In the church was I.
There is a cloister here to the heaven's gate,[644:1]
Thither I went, there found myself alone. 55
Over the altar hung a holy mother;
A wretched painting 'twas, yet 'twas the friend
That I was seeking in this moment. Ah,
How oft have I beheld that glorious form
In splendour, mid ecstatic worshippers; 60
Yet, still it moved me not! and now at once
Was my devotion cloudless as my love.

Countess. Enjoy your fortune and felicity!
Forget the world around you. Meantime, friendship
Shall keep strict vigils for you, anxious, active. 65
Only be manageable when that friendship
Points you the road to full accomplishment.
How long may it be since you declared your passion?

Max. This morning did I hazard the first word.

Countess. This morning the first time in twenty days? 70

Max. 'Twas at that hunting-castle, betwixt here
And Nepomuck, where you had joined us, and&mdash;
That was the last relay of the whole journey!
In a balcony we were standing mute,
And gazing out upon the dreary field: 75
Before us the dragoons were riding onward,
The safe-guard which the Duke had sent us&mdash;heavy
The inquietude of parting lay upon me,
And trembling ventured I at length these words:
This all reminds me, noble maiden, that 80
To-day I must take leave of my good fortune.
A few hours more, and you will find a father,
Will see yourself surrounded by new friends,
And I henceforth shall be but as a stranger,
Lost in the many&mdash;'Speak with my aunt Tertsky!' 85
With hurrying voice she interrupted me.
[645]
She faltered. I beheld a glowing red
Possess her beautiful cheeks, and from the ground
Raised slowly up her eye met mine&mdash;no longer
Did I control myself.


[The Princess Thekla appears at the door, and
remains standing, observed by the Countess,
but not by Piccolomini.


With instant boldness 90
I caught her in my arms, my mouth touched hers;
There was a rustling in the room close by;
It parted us&mdash;'Twas you. What since has happened,
You know.

Countess. And is it your excess of modesty;
Or are you so incurious, that you do not 95
Ask me too of my secret?

Max. Of your secret?

Countess. Why, yes! When in the instant after you
I stepped into the room, and found my niece there,
What she in this first moment of the heart
Ta'en with surprise&mdash;

Max. Well? 100




FOOTNOTES:

[642:1] All this is terribly childish, at least appears so to
an English lover. Besides it is modern French Comedy&mdash;for which, by
the by, we want a word to distinguish it from the toto caelo different
Comedy which Shakespere and his contemporaries worked up into their
Tragedy with such felicity of action and reaction. MS. R.

[644:1] I am doubtful whether this be the dedication of the
cloister or the name of one of the city gates, near which it stood. I
have translated it in the former sense; but fearful of having made some
blunder, I add the original&mdash;Es ist ein Kloster hier zur

Scene IV

Thekla (hurries forward), Countess, Max Piccolomini.


Thekla (to the Countess). Spare yourself the trouble:
That hears he better from myself.

Max. My Princess!
What have you let her hear me say, aunt Tertsky?

Thekla (to the Countess). Has he been here long?

Countess. Yes; and soon must go.
Where have you stayed so long?

Thekla. Alas! my mother 5
Wept so again! and I&mdash;I see her suffer,
Yet cannot keep myself from being happy.

Max. Now once again I have courage to look on you.
To-day at noon I could not.
The dazzle of the jewels that play'd round you 10
Hid the beloved from me.

Thekla. Then you saw me
[646]
With your eye only&mdash;and not with your heart?

Max. This morning, when I found you in the circle
Of all your kindred, in your father's arms,
Beheld myself an alien in this circle, 15
O! what an impulse felt I in that moment
To fall upon his neck, to call him father!
But his stern eye o'erpowered the swelling passion&mdash;
It dared not but be silent. And those brilliants,
That like a crown of stars enwreathed your brows, 20
They scared me too! O wherefore, wherefore should he
At the first meeting spread as 'twere the ban
Of excommunication round you, wherefore
Dress up the angel as for sacrifice,
And cast upon the light and joyous heart 25
The mournful burthen of his station? Fitly
May love dare woo for love; but such a splendour
Might none but monarchs venture to approach.

Thekla. Hush! not a word more of this mummery.
You see how soon the burthen is thrown off. 30
[To the Countess.
He is not in spirits. Wherefore is he not?
'Tis you, aunt, that have made him all so gloomy!
He had quite another nature on the journey&mdash;
So calm, so bright, so joyous eloquent. [To Max.
It was my wish to see you always so, 35
And never otherwise!

Max. You find yourself
In your great father's arms, belov&eacute;d lady!
All in a new world, which does homage to you,
And which, wer't only by its novelty,
Delights your eye.

Thekla. Yes; I confess to you 40
That many things delight me here: this camp,
This motley stage of warriors, which renews
So manifold the image of my fancy,
And binds to life, binds to reality,
What hitherto had but been present to me 45
As a sweet dream!

Max. Alas! not so to me.
It makes a dream of my reality.
Upon some island in the ethereal heights
I've lived for these last days. This mass of men
[647]
Forces me down to earth. It is a bridge 50
That, reconducting to my former life,
Divides me and my heaven.

Thekla. The game of life
Looks cheerful, when one carries in one's heart
The inalienable treasure. 'Tis a game,
Which having once reviewed, I turn more joyous 55
Back to my deeper and appropriate bliss.
In this short time that I've been present here,
What new unheard-of things have I not seen!
And yet they all must give place to the wonder
Which this mysterious castle guards.

Countess. And what 60
Can this be then? Methought I was acquainted
With all the dusky corners of this house.

Thekla. Ay, but the road thereto is watched by spirits,
Two griffins still stand sentry at the door.

Countess (laughs). The astrological tower!&mdash;How happens it 65
That this same sanctuary, whose access
Is to all others so impracticable,
Opens before you even at your approach?

Thekla. A dwarfish old man with a friendly face
And snow-white hairs, whose gracious services 70
Were mine at first sight, opened me the doors.

Max. That is the Duke's astrologer, old Seni.

Thekla. He questioned me on many points; for instance,
When I was born, what month, and on what day,
Whether by day or in the night.

Countess. He wished 75
To erect a figure for your horoscope.

Thekla. My hand too he examined, shook his head
With much sad meaning, and the lines methought,
Did not square over truly with his wishes.

Countess. Well, Princess, and what found you in this tower? 80
My highest privilege has been to snatch
A side-glance, and away!

Thekla. [647:1]It was a strange
[648]
Sensation that came o'er me, when at first
From the broad sunshine I stepped in; and now
The narrowing line of day-light, that ran after 85
The closing door, was gone; and all about me
'Twas pale and dusky night, with many shadows
Fantastically cast. Here six or seven
Colossal statues, and all kings, stood round me
In a half-circle. Each one in his hand 90
A sceptre bore, and on his head a star;
And in the tower no other light was there
But from these stars: all seemed to come from them.
'These are the planets,' said that low old man,
'They govern worldly fates, and for that cause 95
Are imaged here as kings. He farthest from you,
Spiteful, and cold, an old man melancholy,
With bent and yellow forehead, he is Saturn.
He opposite, the king with the red light,
An arm'd man for the battle, that is Mars: 100
And both these bring but little luck to man.'
But at his side a lovely lady stood,
The star upon her head was soft and bright,
And that was Venus, the bright star of joy.
On the left hand, lo! Mercury, with wings. 105
Quite in the middle glittered silver-bright
A cheerful man, and with a monarch's mien;
And this was Jupiter, my father's star:
And at his side I saw the Sun and Moon.

Max. O never rudely will I blame his faith 110
In the might of stars and angels! 'Tis not merely
The human being's Pride that peoples space
With life and mystical predominance;
Since likewise for the stricken heart of Love
This visible nature, and this common world, 115
Is all too narrow: yea, a deeper import
Lurks in the legend told my infant years
Than lies upon that truth, we live to learn.
For fable is Love's world, his home, his birth-place;
Delightedly dwells he 'mong fays and talismans, 120
And spirits; and delightedly believes
Divinities, being himself divine.
[649]
The intelligible forms of ancient poets,
The fair humanities of old religion,
The Power, the Beauty, and the Majesty, 125
That had their haunts in dale, or piny mountain,
Or forest by slow stream, or pebbly spring,
Or chasms and wat'ry depths; all these have vanished.
They live no longer in the faith of reason!
But still the heart doth need a language, still 130
Doth the old instinct bring back the old names,
And to yon starry world they now are gone,
Spirits or gods, that used to share this earth
With man as with their friend;[649:1] and to the lover
Yonder they move, from yonder visible sky 135
Shoot influence down: and even at this day
'Tis Jupiter who brings whate'er is great,
And Venus who brings every thing that's fair!

Thekla. And if this be the science of the stars,
I too, with glad and zealous industry, 140
Will learn acquaintance with this cheerful faith.
It is a gentle and affectionate thought,
That in immeasurable heights above us,
At our first birth, the wreath of love was woven,
With sparkling stars for flowers.

Countess. Not only roses, 145
But thorns too hath the heaven; and well for you
Leave they your wreath of love inviolate;
What Venus twined, the bearer of glad fortune,
The sullen orb of Mars soon tears to pieces.

Max. Soon will his gloomy empire reach its close. 150
Blest be the General's zeal: into the laurel
Will he inweave the olive-branch, presenting
Peace to the shouting nations. Then no wish
Will have remained for his great heart! Enough
Has he performed for glory, and can now 155
Live for himself and his. To his domains
Will he retire; he has a stately seat
Of fairest view at Gitschin; Reichenberg,
And Friedland Castle, both lie pleasantly&mdash;
[650]
Even to the foot of the huge mountains here 160
Stretches the chase and covers of his forests:
His ruling passion, to create the splendid,
He can indulge without restraint; can give
A princely patronage to every art,
And to all worth a Sovereign's protection. 165
Can build, can plant, can watch the starry courses&mdash;

Countess. Yet I would have you look, and look again,
Before you lay aside your arms, young friend!
A gentle bride, as she is, is well worth it,
That you should woo and win her with the sword. 170

Max. O, that the sword could win her!

Countess. What was that?
Did you hear nothing? Seem'd, as if I heard
Tumult and larum in the banquet-room.
[Exit Countess.

Thekla and Max Piccolomini.


Thekla (as soon us the Countess is out of sight, in a quick low
voice to Piccolomini).
Don't trust them! They are false!

Max. Impossible!

Thekla. Trust no one here but me. I saw at once,
They had a purpose.

Max. Purpose! but what purpose?
And how can we be instrumental to it?

Thekla. I know no more than you; but yet believe me: 5
There's some design in this! to make us happy,
To realize our union&mdash;trust me, love!
They but pretend to wish it.

Max. But these Tertskys&mdash;&mdash;
Why use we them at all? Why not your mother?
Excellent creature! she deserves from us 10
A full and filial confidence.

Thekla. She doth love you,
Doth rate you high before all others&mdash;but&mdash;
But such a secret&mdash;she would never have
The courage to conceal it from my father.
For her own peace of mind we must preserve it 15
A secret from her too.

Max. Why any secret?
I love not secrets. Mark, what I will do.
[651]
I'll throw me at your father's feet&mdash;let him
Decide upon my fortunes!&mdash;He is true,
He wears no mask&mdash;he hates all crooked ways&mdash; 20
He is so good, so noble!

Thekla (falls on his neck). That are you!

Max. You knew him only since this morn; but I
Have liv'd ten years already in his presence,
And who knows whether in this very moment
He is not merely waiting for us both 25
To own our loves, in order to unite us.
You are silent!&mdash;&mdash;
You look at me with such a hopelessness!
What have you to object against your father?

Thekla. I? Nothing. Only he's so occupied&mdash; 30
He has no leisure time to think about
The happiness of us two. [Taking his hand tenderly.
Follow me!
Let us not place too great a faith in men.
These Tertskys&mdash;we will still be grateful to them
For every kindness, but not trust them further 35
Than they deserve;&mdash;and in all else rely&mdash;&mdash;
On our own hearts!

Max. O! shall we e'er be happy?

Thekla. Are we not happy now? Art thou not mine?
Am I not thine? There lives within my soul
A lofty courage&mdash;'tis love gives it me! 40
I ought to be less open&mdash;ought to hide
My heart more from thee&mdash;so decorum dictates:[651:1]
But where in this place could'st thou seek for truth,
If in my mouth thou did'st not find it?

Scene VI

To them enters the Countess Tertsky.


Countess. Come!
My husband sends me for you&mdash;It is now
[652]
The latest moment.
Part you!

Thekla. O, not yet!
It has been scarce a moment.

Countess. Aye! Then time
Flies swiftly with your Highness, Princess niece! 5

Max. There is no hurry, aunt.

Countess. Away! Away!
The folks begin to miss you. Twice already
His father has asked for him.

Thekla. Ha! his father?

Countess. You understand that, niece!

Thekla. Why needs he
To go at all to that society? 10
'Tis not his proper company. They may
Be worthy men, but he's too young for them.
In brief, he suits not such society.

Countess. You mean, you'd rather keep him wholly here?

Thekla. Yes! you have hit it, aunt! That is my meaning. 15
Leave him here wholly! Tell the company&mdash;

Countess. What? have you lost your senses, niece?&mdash;
Count, you remember the conditions. Come!

Max (to Thekla). Lady, I must obey. Farewell, dear lady!
[Thekla turns away from him with a quick motion.
What say you then, dear lady?

Thekla (without looking at him). Nothing. Go! 20

Max. Can I, when you are angry&mdash;&mdash;


[He draws up to her, their eyes meet, she stands silent a moment, then
throws herself into his arms; he presses her fast to his heart.


Countess. Off! Heavens! if any one should come!
Hark! What's that noise? It comes this way.&mdash;&mdash;Off!


[Max tears himself away out of her arms, and goes. The Countess
accompanies him. Thekla follows him with her eyes at first, walks
restlessly across the room, then stops, and remains standing, lost in
thought. A guitar lies on the table, she seizes it as by a sudden
emotion, and after she has played a while an irregular and melancholy
symphony, she falls gradually into the music and sings.

[653]
Thekla (plays and sings).



The cloud doth gather, the greenwood roar,
The damsel paces along the shore; 25
The billows they tumble with might, with might;
And she flings out her voice to the darksome night;

Her bosom is swelling with sorrow;
The world it is empty, the heart will die,
There's nothing to wish for beneath the sky: 30
Thou Holy One, call thy child away!
I've lived and loved, and that was to-day&mdash;
Make ready my grave-clothes to-morrow.[653:1]





FOOTNOTES:

[653:1] I found it not in my power to translate this song with
literal fidelity, preserving at the same time the Alcaic Movement, and
have therefore added the original with a prose translation. Some of my
readers may be more fortunate.

Thekla (spielt und singt).


Der Eichwald brauset, die Wolken ziehn,
Das M&auml;gdlein wandelt an Ufers Gr&uuml;n,
Es bricht sich die Welle mit Macht, mit Macht,
Und sie singt hinaus in die finstre Nacht,
Das Auge von Weinen getr&uuml;bet:
Das Herz ist gestorben, die Welt ist leer,
Und weiter giebt sie dem Wunsche nichts mehr.
Du Heilige, rufe dein Kind zur&uuml;ck,
Ich habe genossen das irdische Gl&uuml;ck,
Ich habe gelebt und geliebet.


Literal Translation.

Thekla (plays and sings).

The oak-forest bellows, the clouds gather, the damsel walks to and fro
on the green of the shore; the wave breaks with might, with might, and
she sings out into the dark night, her eye discoloured with weeping: the
heart is dead, the world is empty, and further gives it nothing more to
the wish. Thou Holy One, call thy child home. I have enjoyed the
happiness of this world, I have lived and have loved.

I cannot but add here an imitation of this song, with which the author
of The Tale of Rosamond Gray and Blind Margaret has favoured me, and
which appears to me to have caught the happiest manner of our old
ballads.


The clouds are black'ning, the storms threat'ning,
The cavern doth mutter, the greenwood moan;
Billows are breaking, the damsel's heart aching,
Thus in the dark night she singeth alone,
Her eye upward roving:
The world is empty, the heart is dead surely,
In this world plainly all seemeth amiss;
To thy heaven, Holy One, take home thy little one,
I have partaken of all earth's bliss,
Both living and loving.


The text of Lamb's version as printed in Works, 1818, i. 42 is as
follows:

BALLAD.

From the German.


The clouds are blackening, the storms threatening,
And ever the forest maketh a moan:
Billows are breaking, the damsel's heart aching,
Thus by herself she singeth alone,
Weeping right plenteously.
The world is empty, the heart is dead surely,
In this world plainly all seemeth amiss:
To thy breast, holy one, take now thy little one,
I have had earnest of all earth's bliss
Living most lovingly.

Scene VII

Countess (returns), Thekla.


Countess. Fie, lady niece! to throw yourself upon him,
Like a poor gift to one who cares not for it,
And so must be flung after him! For you,
Duke Friedland's only child, I should have thought
It had been more beseeming to have shewn yourself 5
More chary of your person.

Thekla. And what mean you?

Countess. I mean, niece, that you should not have forgotten
Who you are, and who he is. But perchance
That never once occurred to you.

Thekla. What then?

Countess. That you're the daughter of the Prince-Duke Friedland. 10

Thekla. Well&mdash;and what farther?

Countess. What? a pretty question!

Thekla. He was born that which we have but become.
He's of an ancient Lombard family,
Son of a reigning princess.

Countess. Are you dreaming?
Talking in sleep? An excellent jest, forsooth! 15
We shall no doubt right courteously entreat him
To honour with his hand the richest heiress
In Europe.

Thekla. That will not be necessary.

Countess. Methinks 'twere well though not to run the hazard.


[655]


Thekla. His father loves him, Count Octavio 20
Will interpose no difficulty&mdash;&mdash;

Countess. His!
His father! his! But yours, niece, what of yours?

Thekla. Why I begin to think you fear his father,
So anxiously you hide it from the man!
His father, his, I mean.

Countess (looks at her). Niece, you are false. 25

Thekla. Are you then wounded? O, be friends with me!

Countess. You hold your game for won already. Do not
Triumph too soon!&mdash;

Thekla. Nay now, be friends with me.

Countess. It is not yet so far gone.

Thekla. I believe you.

Countess. Did you suppose your father had laid out 30
His most important life in toils of war,
Denied himself each quiet earthly bliss,
Had banished slumber from his tent, devoted
His noble head to care, and for this only,
To make a happy pair of you? At length 35
To draw you from your convent, and conduct
In easy triumph to your arms the man
That chanc'd to please your eyes! All this, methinks,
He might have purchased at a cheaper rate.

Thekla. That which he did not plant for me might yet 40
Bear me fair fruitage of its own accord.
And if my friendly and affectionate fate,
Out of his fearful and enormous being,
Will but prepare the joys of life for me&mdash;

[655:1]Countess. Thou seest it with a love-lorn maiden's eyes. 45
Cast thine eye round, bethink thee who thou art.
Into no house of joyance hast thou stepped,
For no espousals dost thou find the walls
Deck'd out, no guests the nuptial garland wearing.
Here is no splendour but of arms. Or think'st thou 50
That all these thousands are here congregated
To lead up the long dances at thy wedding?
Thou see'st thy father's forehead full of thought,
[656]
Thy mother's eye in tears: upon the balance
Lies the great destiny of all our house. 55
Leave now the puny wish, the girlish feeling,
O thrust it far behind thee! Give thou proof,
Thou'rt the daughter of the Mighty&mdash;his
Who where he moves creates the wonderful.
Not to herself the woman must belong, 60
Annexed and bound to alien destinies.
But she performs the best part, she the wisest,
Who can transmute the alien into self,
Meet and disarm necessity by choice;
And what must be, take freely to her heart, 65
And bear and foster it with mother's love.

Thekla. Such ever was my lesson in the convent.
I had no loves, no wishes, knew myself
Only as his&mdash;his daughter&mdash;his, the Mighty!
His fame, the echo of whose blast drove to me 70
From the far distance, wakened in my soul
No other thought than this&mdash;I am appointed
To offer up myself in passiveness to him.

Countess. That is thy fate. Mould thou thy wishes to it.
I and thy mother gave thee the example. 75

Thekla. My fate hath shewn me him, to whom behoves it
That I should offer up myself. In gladness
Him will I follow.

Countess. Not thy fate hath shewn him!
Thy heart, say rather&mdash;'twas thy heart, my child!

Thekla. Fate hath no voice but the heart's impulses. 80
I am all his! His Present&mdash;his alone,
Is this new life, which lives in me. He hath
A right to his own creature. What was I
Ere his fair love infused a soul into me?

Countess. Thou would'st oppose thy father then, should he 85
Have otherwise determined with thy person?
[Thekla remains silent. The Countess continues.
Thou mean'st to force him to thy liking?&mdash;Child,
His name is Friedland.

Thekla. My name too is Friedland.
He shall have found a genuine daughter in me.

Countess. What? he has vanquished all impediment, 90
And in the wilful mood of his own daughter
[657]
Shall a new struggle rise for him? Child! child!
As yet thou hast seen thy father's smiles alone;
The eye of his rage thou hast not seen. Dear child,
I will not frighten thee. To that extreme, 95
I trust, it ne'er shall come. His will is yet
Unknown to me: 'tis possible his aims
May have the same direction as thy wish.
But this can never, never be his will,
That thou, the daughter of his haughty fortunes, 100
Should'st e'er demean thee as a love-sick maiden;
And like some poor cost-nothing, fling thyself
Toward the man, who, if that high prize ever
Be destined to await him, yet, with sacrifices
The highest love can bring, must pay for it. [Exit Countess. 105

Thekla. I thank thee for the hint. It turns
My sad presentiment to certainty.
And it is so!&mdash;Not one friend have we here,
Not one true heart! we've nothing but ourselves!
O she said rightly&mdash;no auspicious signs 110
Beam on this covenant of our affections.
This is no theatre, where hope abides.
The dull thick noise of war alone stirs here.
And love himself, as he were armed in steel,
Steps forth, and girds him for the strife of death. 115
[Music from the banquet-room is heard.
There's a dark spirit walking in our house,
And swiftly will the Destiny close on us.
It drove me hither from my calm asylum,
It mocks my soul with charming witchery,
It lures me forward in a seraph's shape, 120
I see it near, I see it nearer floating,
It draws, it pulls me with a god-like power&mdash;
And lo! the abyss&mdash;and thither am I moving&mdash;
I have no power within me not to move!
[The music from the banquet-room becomes louder.
O when a house is doomed in fire to perish, 125
Many a dark heaven drives his clouds together,
Yea, shoots his lightnings down from sunny heights,
Flames burst from out the subterraneous chasms,
[658]
And fiends and angels mingling in their fury,
Sling fire-brands at the burning edifice.[658:1] 130
[Exit Thekla.

[658:A] The two lines are sufficiently fustian, but this seems

Scene VIII

A large Saloon lighted up with festal Splendour; in the midst of it,
and in the Centre of the Stage, a Table richly set out, at which eight
Generals are sitting, among whom are Octavio Piccolomini, Tertsky, and
Maradas. Right and left of this, but farther back, two other Tables, at
each of which six Persons are placed. The Middle Door, which is standing
open, gives to the Prospect a Fourth Table, with the same Number of
Persons. More forward stands the sideboard. The whole front of the Stage
is kept open for the Pages and Servants in waiting. All is in Motion.
The Band of Music belonging to Tertsky's Regiment march across the
Stage, and draw up round the Tables. Before they are quite off from the
Front of the Stage, Max Piccolomini appears, Tertsky advances towards
him with a Paper, Isolani comes up to meet him with a Beaker or
Service-cup.

Tertsky, Isolani, Max Piccolomini.


Isolani. Here brother, what we love! Why, where hast been?
Off to thy place&mdash;quick! Tertsky here has given
The mother's holiday wine up to free booty.
Here it goes on as at the Heidelberg castle.
Already hast thou lost the best. They're giving 5
At yonder table ducal crowns in shares;
There's Sternberg's lands and chattels are put up,
With Egenberg's, Stawata's, Lichtenstein's,
And all the great Bohemian feodalities.
Be nimble, lad! and something may turn up 10
[659]
For thee&mdash;who knows? off&mdash;to thy place! quick! march!

Tiefenbach and Goetz (call out from the second and third tables). Count Piccolomini!

Tertsky. Stop, ye shall have him in an instant.&mdash;Read
This oath here, whether as 'tis here set forth,
The wording satisfies you. They've all read it, 15
Each in his turn, and each one will subscribe
His individual signature.

Max (reads). 'Ingratis servire nefas.'

Isolani. That sounds to my ears very much like Latin,
And being interpreted, pray what may't mean?

Tertsky. No honest man will serve a thankless master. 20

Max. 'Inasmuch as our supreme Commander, the illustrious
Duke of Friedland, in consequence of the manifold affronts and
grievances which he has received, had expressed his determination
to quit the Emperor, but on our unanimous entreaty has
graciously consented to remain still with the army, and not to 25
part from us without our approbation thereof, so we, collectively
and each in particular, in the stead of an oath personally taken,
do hereby oblige ourselves&mdash;likewise by him honourably and
faithfully to hold, and in nowise whatsoever from him to
part, and to be ready to shed for his interests the last drop of 30
our blood, so far, namely, as our oath to the Emperor will permit
it. (These last words are repeated by Isolani.) In testimony of
which we subscribe our names.'

Tertsky. Now!&mdash;are you willing to subscribe this paper?

Isolani. Why should he not? All officers of honour 35
Can do it, aye, must do it.&mdash;Pen and ink here!

Tertsky. Nay, let it rest till after meal.

Isolani (drawing Max along). Come, Max.

Tertsky (beckons to Neumann who is waiting at the side-table, and steps forward with him to the edge of the stage). Have you the copy with you, Neumann? Give it.
It may be changed for the other?

Neumann. I have copied it
Letter by letter, line by line; no eye
Would e'er discover other difference,
Save only the omission of that clause, 5
[660]
According to your Excellency's order.

Tertsky. Right! lay it yonder, and away with this&mdash;

Neumann lays the copy on the table and steps back again to the
side-table.

Illo. How goes it with young Piccolomini?

Tertsky. All right, I think. He has started no objection.

Illo. He is the only one I fear about&mdash;
He and his father. Have an eye on both!

Tertsky. How looks it at your table: you forget not 5
To keep them warm and stirring?

Illo. O, quite cordial,
They are quite cordial in the scheme. We have them.
And 'tis as I predicted too. Already
It is the talk, not merely to maintain
The Duke in station. 'Since we're once for all 10
Together and unanimous, why not,'
Says Montecuculi, 'aye, why not onward,
And make conditions with the Emperor
There in his own Vienna?' Trust me, Count,
Were it not for these said Piccolomini, 15
We might have spared ourselves the cheat.

Tertsky. And Butler?
How goes it there? Hush!




Scene XI

To them enter Butler from the second table.


Butler. Don't disturb yourselves.
Field Marshal, I have understood you perfectly.
Good luck be to the scheme; and as to me,
You may depend upon me.

Illo. May we, Butler?

Butler. With or without the clause, all one to me! 5
You understand me? My fidelity
The Duke may put to any proof&mdash;I'm with him!
Tell him so! I'm the Emperor's officer,
As long as 'tis his pleasure to remain
[661]The Emperor's general! and Friedland's servant, 10
As soon as it shall please him to become
His own lord.

Tertsky. You would make a good exchange.
No stern economist, no Ferdinand,
Is he to whom you plight your services.

Butler. I do not put up my fidelity 15
To sale, Count Tertsky! Half a year ago
I would not have advised you to have made me
An overture to that, to which I now
Offer myself of my own free accord.&mdash;
But that is past! and to the Duke, Field Marshal, 20
I bring myself together with my regiment.
And mark you, 'tis my humour to believe,
The example which I give will not remain
Without an influence.

Illo. Who is ignorant,
That the whole army look to Colonel Butler, 25
As to a light that moves before them?

Butler. Ey?
Then I repent me not of that fidelity
Which for the length of forty years I held,
If in my sixtieth year my old good name
Can purchase for me a revenge so full. 30
Start not at what I say, sir Generals!
My real motives&mdash;they concern not you.
And you yourselves, I trust, could not expect
That this your game had crooked my judgment&mdash;or
That fickleness, quick blood, or such light cause, 35
Had driven the old man from the track of honour,
Which he so long had trodden.&mdash;Come, my friends!
I'm not thereto determined with less firmness,
Because I know and have looked steadily
At that on which I have determined.

Illo. Say, 40
And speak roundly, what are we to deem you?

Butler. A friend! I give you here my hand! I'm yours
With all I have. Not only men, but money
Will the Duke want.&mdash;&mdash;Go, tell him, sirs!
I've earned and laid up somewhat in his service, 45
[662]I lend it him; and is he my survivor,
It has been already long ago bequeathed him.
He is my heir. For me, I stand alone,
Here in the world; nought know I of the feeling
That binds the husband to a wife and children. 50
My name dies with me, my existence ends.

Illo. 'Tis not your money that he needs&mdash;a heart
Like yours weighs tons of gold down, weighs down millions!

Butler. I came a simple soldier's boy from Ireland
To Prague&mdash;and with a master, whom I buried. 55
From lowest stable-duty I climbed up,
Such was the fate of war, to this high rank,
The plaything of a whimsical good fortune.
And Wallenstein too is a child of luck,
I love a fortune that is like my own. 60

Illo. All powerful souls have kindred with each other.

Butler. This is an awful moment! to the brave,
To the determined, an auspicious moment.
The Prince of Weimar arms, upon the Maine
To found a mighty dukedom. He of Halberstadt, 65
That Mansfeld, wanted but a longer life
To have marked out with his good sword a lordship
That should reward his courage. Who of these
Equals our Friedland? there is nothing, nothing
So high, but he may set the ladder to it! 70

Tertsky. That's spoken like a man!

Butler. Do you secure the Spaniard and Italian&mdash;
I'll be your warrant for the Scotchman Lesly.
Come! to the company!

Tertsky. Where is the master of the cellar? Ho! 75
Let the best wines come up. Ho! cheerly, boy!
Luck comes to-day, so give her hearty welcome.
[Exeunt, each to his table.

Scene XII

The Master of the Cellar advancing with Neumann, Servants passing
backwards and forwards.


Master of the Cellar. The best wine! O! if my old mistress,
his lady mother, could but see these wild goings on, she
would turn herself round in her grave. Yes, yes, sir officer!
'tis all down the hill with this noble house! no end, no
[663]
moderation! And this marriage with the Duke's sister, a 5
splendid  connection, a very splendid connection! but I tell you,
sir officer, it bodes no good.

Neumann. Heaven forbid! Why, at this very moment the
whole prospect is in bud and blossom!

Master of the Cellar. You think so?&mdash;Well, well! much 10
may be said on that head.

First Servant (comes). Burgundy for the fourth table.

Master of the Cellar. Now, sir lieutenant, if this isn't the
seventieth flask&mdash;&mdash;

First Servant. Why, the reason is, that German lord, 15
Tiefenbach, sits at that table.

Master of the Cellar (continuing his discourse to Neumann).
They are soaring too high. They would rival kings and
electors in their pomp and splendour; and wherever the
Duke leaps, not a minute does my gracious master, the
Count, loiter on the brink&mdash;&mdash;(To the Servants)&mdash;What do 20
you stand there listening for? I will let you know you have
legs presently. Off! see to the tables, see to the flasks!
Look there! Count Palfi has an empty glass before him!

Runner (comes). The great service-cup is wanted, sir; that
rich gold cup with the Bohemian arms on it. The Count 25
says you know which it is.

Master of the Cellar. Ay! that was made for Frederick's
coronation by the artist William&mdash;there was not such
another prize in the whole booty at Prague.

Runner. The same!&mdash;a health is to go round in him. 30

Master of the Cellar. This will be something for the
tale-bearers&mdash;this goes to Vienna.

Neumann. Permit me to look at it.&mdash;Well, this is a cup
indeed! How heavy! as well it may be, being all
gold.&mdash;And what neat things are embossed on it! how natural 35
and elegant they look! There, on that first quarter, let me
see. That proud Amazon there on horseback, she that is
taking a leap over the crosier and mitres, and carries on a
wand a hat together with a banner, on which there's
a goblet represented. Can you tell me what all this signifies? 40

Master of the Cellar. The woman whom you see there on
horseback, is the Free Election of the Bohemian Crown.
That is signified by the round hat, and by that fiery steed
on which she is riding. The hat is the pride of man; for
[664]
he who cannot keep his hat on before kings and emperors 45
is no free man.

Neumann. But what is the cup there on the banner?

Master of the Cellar. The cup signifies the freedom of the
Bohemian Church, as it was in our forefathers' times. Our
forefathers in the wars of the Hussites forced from the Pope 50
this noble privilege: for the Pope, you know, will not grant
the cup to any layman. Your true Moravian values nothing
beyond the cup; it is his costly jewel, and has cost the
Bohemians their precious blood in many and many a battle.

Neumann. And what says that chart that hangs in the air 55
there, over it all?

Master of the Cellar. That signifies the Bohemian letter
royal, which we forced from the Emperor Rudolph&mdash;a
precious, never to be enough valued parchment that secures
to the new Church the old privileges of free ringing and 60
open psalmody. But since he of Steierm&auml;rk has ruled over
us, that is at an end; and after the battle of Prague, in
which Count Palatine Frederick lost crown and empire, our
faith hangs upon the pulpit and the altar&mdash;and our brethren
look at their homes over their shoulders; but the letter 65
royal the Emperor himself cut to pieces with his scissors.

Neumann. Why, my good Master of the Cellar! you are
deep read in the chronicles of your country!

Master of the Cellar. So were my forefathers, and for that
reason were they minstrels, and served under Procopius and 70
Ziska. Peace be with their ashes! Well, well! they fought
for a good cause though&mdash;There! carry it up!

Neumann. Stay! let me but look at this second quarter.
Look there! That is, when at Prague Castle the Imperial
Counsellors, Martinitz and Stawata were hurled down head 75
over heels. 'Tis even so! there stands Count Thur who
commands it.

[Runner takes the service-cup and goes off with it.

Master of the Cellar. O let me never more hear of that day.
It was the three and twentieth of May, in the year of our
Lord one thousand, six hundred, and eighteen. It seems to me 80
as it were but yesterday&mdash;from that unlucky day it all began,
all the heart-aches of the country. Since that day it is now
sixteen years, and there has never once been peace on the earth.

[Health drunk aloud at the second table.

The Prince of Weimar! Hurra!

[At the third and fourth table.

[665]
Long live Prince William! Long live Duke Bernard! 85
Hurra! [Music strikes up.

First Servant. Hear 'em! Hear 'em! What an uproar!

Second Servant (comes in running). Did you hear? They have
drunk the Prince of Weimar's health.

Third Servant. The Swedish Chief Commander! 90

First Servant (speaking at the same time). The Lutheran!

Second Servant. Just before, when Count Deodate gave out
the Emperor's health, they were all as mum as a nibbling
mouse.

Master of the Cellar. Po, po! When the wine goes in, 95
strange things come out. A good servant hears, and hears
not!&mdash;You should be nothing but eyes and feet, except when
you are called.

Second Servant (to the Runner, to whom he gives secretly a flask
of wine, keeping his eye on the Master of the Cellar, standing
between him and the Runner). Quick, Thomas! before the
Master of the Cellar runs this way&mdash;'tis a flask of 100
Frontignac!&mdash;Snapped it up at the third table.&mdash;Canst go off
with it?

Runner (hides it in his pocket). All right!

[Exit the Second Servant.

Third Servant (aside to the First). Be on the hark, Jack! that
we may have right plenty to tell to father Quivoga&mdash;He will 105
give us right plenty of absolution in return for it.

First Servant. For that very purpose I am always having
something to do behind Illo's chair.&mdash;He is the man for speeches
to make you stare with!

Master of the Cellar (to Neumann). Who, pray, may that 110
swarthy man be, he with the cross, that is chatting so
confidentially with Esterhats?

Neumann. Ay! he too is one of those to whom they confide
too much. He calls himself Maradas, a Spaniard is he.

Master of the Cellar (impatiently). Spaniard! Spaniard!&mdash;I 115
tell you, friend; nothing good comes of those Spaniards. All
these out-landish[665:1] fellows are little better than rogues.

[666]
Neumann. Fy, fy! you should not say so, friend. There are
among them our very best generals, and those on whom the
Duke at this moment relies the most. 120

Master of the Cellar (taking the flask out of the Runner's pocket).
My son, it will be broken to pieces in your pocket.

[Tertsky hurries in, fetches away the paper, and calls to a Servant
for pen and ink, and goes to the back of the stage.

Master of the Cellar (to the Servants). The Lieutenant-General
stands up.&mdash;Be on the watch.&mdash;Now! They break up.&mdash;Off,
and move back the forms.

[They rise at all the tables, the Servants hurry off the front of the
stage to the tables; part of the guests come forward.



FOOTNOTES:

[665:1] There is a humour in the original which cannot be given
in the translation. 'Die welschen alle,' &amp;c., which word in classical
German means the Italians alone; but in its first sense, and at
present in the vulgar use of the word, signifies foreigners in
general. Our word wall-nuts, I suppose, means outlandish nuts&mdash;Wallae
nuces, in German 'Welschn&uuml;sse'.&mdash;T.

Scene XIII

Octavio Piccolomini enters in conversation with Maradas, and both place
themselves quite on the edge of the stage on one side of the proscenium.
On the side directly opposite, Max Piccolomini, by himself, lost in
thought, and taking no part in any thing that is going forward. The
middle space between both, but rather more distant from the edge of the
stage, is filled up by Butler, Isolani, Goetz, Tiefenbach, and Kolatto.

Isolani (while the company is coming forward). Good night,
good night, Kolatto! Good night, Lieutenant-General!&mdash;I should
rather say, good morning.

Goetz (to Tiefenbach). Noble brother!

Tiefenbach. Ay! 'twas a royal feast indeed. 5

Goetz. Yes, my Lady Countess understands these matters.
Her mother-in-law, heaven rest her soul, taught her!&mdash;Ah!
that was a housewife for you!

Tiefenbach. There was not her like in all Bohemia for setting
out a table. 10

Octavio (aside to Maradas). Do me the favour to talk to
me&mdash;talk of what you will&mdash;or of nothing. Only preserve the
appearance at least of talking. I would not wish to stand by
myself, and yet I conjecture that there will be goings on here
worthy of our attentive observation. 15

Isolani (on the point of going). Lights! lights!

Tertsky (advances with the paper to Isolani). Noble brother!
two minutes longer!&mdash;Here is something to subscribe.

[667]
Isolani. Subscribe as much as you like&mdash;but you must excuse
me from reading it. 20

Tertsky. There is no need. It is the oath which you have
already read.&mdash;Only a few marks of your pen!

[Isolani hands over the paper to Octavio respectfully.

Tertsky. Nay, nay, first come first served. There is no
precedence here.

[Octavio runs over the paper with apparent indifference. Tertsky
watches him at some distance.

Goetz (to Tertsky). Noble Count! with your 25
permission&mdash;Good night.

Tertsky. Where's the hurry? Come, one other composing
draught. (To the Servants)&mdash;Ho!

Goetz. Excuse me&mdash;an't able.

Tertsky. A thimble-full! 30

Goetz. Excuse me.

Tiefenbach (sits down). Pardon me, nobles!&mdash;This standing
does not agree with me.

Tertsky. Consult only your own convenience, General!

Tiefenbach. Clear at head, sound in stomach&mdash;only my legs 35
won't carry me any longer.

Isolani. Poor legs! how should they? Such an unmerciful
load!

[Octavio subscribes his name, and reaches over the paper to Tertsky, who
gives it to Isolani; and he goes to the table to sign his name.

Tiefenbach. 'Twas that war in Pomerania that first brought
it on. Out in all weathers&mdash;ice and snow&mdash;no help for it.&mdash;I 40
shall never get the better of it all the days of my life.

Goetz. Why, in simple verity, your Swede makes no nice
enquiries about the season.

Tertsky (observing Isolani, whose hand trembles excessively, so
that he can scarce direct his pen). Have you had that ugly
complaint long, noble brother?&mdash;Dispatch it. 45

Isolani. The sins of youth! I have already tried the
Chalybeate waters. Well&mdash;I must bear it.

[Tertsky gives the paper to Maradas; he steps to the table to
subscribe.

Octavio (advancing to Butler). You are not over fond of the
orgies of Bacchus, Colonel! I have observed it. You would, I
think, find yourself more to your liking in the uproar of a battle, 50
than of a feast.

[668]
Butler. I must confess, 'tis not in my way.

Octavio. Nor in mine either, I can assure you; and I am not
a little glad, my much honoured Colonel Butler, that we agree
so well in our opinions. A half dozen good friends at most, 55
at a small round table, a glass of genuine Tokay, open hearts,
and a rational conversation&mdash;that's my taste!

Butler. And mine too, when it can be had.

[The paper comes to Tiefenbach, who glances over it at the same time
with Goetz and Kolatto. Maradas in the mean time returns to Octavio, all
this takes place, the conversation with Butler proceeding
uninterrupted.

Octavio (introducing Maradas to Butler). Don Balthasar
Maradas! likewise a man of our stamp, and long ago your admirer. 60

[Butler bows.

Octavio (continuing). You are a stranger here&mdash;'twas but
yesterday you arrived&mdash;you are ignorant of the ways and means
here. 'Tis a wretched place&mdash;I know, at our age, one loves to
be snug and quiet&mdash;What if you moved your lodgings?&mdash;Come,
be my visitor. (Butler makes a low bow.) Nay, without 65
compliment!&mdash;For a friend like you, I have still a corner
remaining.

Butler. Your obliged humble servant, my Lord
Lieutenant-General!

[The paper comes to Butler, who goes to the table to subscribe it. The
front of the stage is vacant, so that both the Piccolominis, each on the
side where he had been from the commencement of the scene, remain
alone.

Octavio (after having some time watched his son in silence, advances
somewhat nearer to him). You were long absent from us,
friend! 70

Max. I&mdash;&mdash;urgent business detained me.

Octavio. And, I observe, you are still absent!

Max. You know this crowd and bustle always makes me
silent. 75

Octavio. May I be permitted to ask what business 'twas that
detained you? Tertsky knows it without asking!

Max. What does Tertsky know?

Octavio. He was the only one who did not miss you.

[669]
Isolani. Well done, father! Rout out his baggage! Beat 80
up his quarters! there is something there that should not be.

Tertsky (with the paper). Is there none wanting? Have the
whole subscribed?

Octavio. All.

Tertsky (calling aloud). Ho! Who subscribes? 85

Butler (to Tertsky). Count the names. There ought to be
just thirty.

Tertsky. Here is a cross.

Tiefenbach. That's my mark.

Isolani. He cannot write; but his cross is a good cross, and 90
is honoured by Jews as well as Christians.

Octavio (presses on to Max). Come, general! let us go. It is late.

Tertsky. One Piccolomini only has signed.

Isolani (pointing to Max). Look! that is your man, that statue
there, who has had neither eye, ear, nor tongue for us the 95
whole evening.

[Max receives the paper from Tertsky, which he looks upon vacantly.

Scene XIV

To these enter Illo from the inner room. He has in his hand the golden
service-cup, and is extremely distempered with drinking: Goetz and
Butler follow him, endeavouring to keep him back.

Illo. What do you want? Let me go.

Goetz and Butler. Drink no more, Illo! For heaven's sake,
drink no more.

Illo (goes up to Octavio, and shakes him cordially by the hand,
and then drinks). Octavio! I bring this to you! Let all grudge
be drowned in this friendly bowl! I know well enough, ye 5
never loved me&mdash;Devil take me!&mdash;and I never loved you!&mdash;I am
always even with people in that way!&mdash;Let what's past be past&mdash;that
is, you understand&mdash;forgotten! I esteem you infinitely.
(Embracing him repeatedly.) You have not a dearer friend on
earth than I&mdash;but that you know. The fellow that cries rogue 10
to you calls me villain&mdash;and I'll strangle him!&mdash;my dear friend!

Tertsky (whispering to him). Art in thy senses? For heaven's
sake, Illo! think where you are!

Illo (aloud). What do you mean?&mdash;There are none but friends
here, are there? Not a sneaker among us, thank heaven! 15

[670]
Tertsky (to Butler). Take him off with you, force him off,
I entreat you, Butler!

Butler (to Illo). Field Marshal! a word with you. [Leads him to the sideboard.

Illo. A thousand for one! Fill&mdash;Fill it once more up to the
brim.&mdash;To this gallant man's health! 20

Isolani (to Max, who all the while has been staring on the paper
with fixed but vacant eyes). Slow and sure, my noble
brother!&mdash;Hast parsed it all yet?&mdash;Some words yet to go through?&mdash;Ha?

Max. What am I to do?

Tertsky (and at the same time Isolani). Sign your name.

Max (returns the paper). Let it stay till to-morrow. It is 25
business&mdash;to-day I am not sufficiently collected. Send it to me
to-morrow.

Tertsky. Nay, collect yourself a little.

Isolani. Awake, man! awake!&mdash;Come, thy signature, and
have done with it! What? Thou art the youngest in the 30
whole company, and wouldest be wiser than all of us together?
Look there! thy father has signed&mdash;we have all signed.

Tertsky (to Octavio). Use your influence. Instruct him.

Octavio. My son is at the age of discretion.

Illo (leaves the service-cup on the sideboard). What's the
dispute? 35

Tertsky. He declines subscribing the paper.

Max. I say, it may as well stay till to-morrow.

Illo. It cannot stay. We have all subscribed to it&mdash;and so
must you.&mdash;You must subscribe.

Max. Illo, good night! 40

Illo. No! You come not off so! The Duke shall learn
who are his friends. [All collect round Illo and Max.

Max. What my sentiments are towards the Duke, the Duke
knows, every one knows&mdash;what need of this wild stuff? 45

Illo. This is the thanks the Duke gets for his partiality to
Italians and foreigners.&mdash;Us Bohemians he holds for little better
than dullards&mdash;nothing pleases him but what's outlandish.

Tertsky (to the commanders, who at Illo's words give a sudden
start, as preparing to resent them). It is the wine that speaks,
and not his reason. Attend not to him, I entreat you. 50

[671]
Isolani. Wine invents nothing: it only tattles.

Illo. He who is not with me is against me. Your tender
consciences! Unless they can slip out by a back-door, by a
puny proviso&mdash;&mdash;

Tertsky. He is stark mad&mdash;don't listen to him! 55

Illo. Unless they can slip out by a proviso.&mdash;What of the
proviso? The devil take this proviso!

Max. What is there here then of such perilous import?
You make me curious&mdash;I must look closer at it.

Tertsky (in a low voice to Illo). What are you doing, Illo? 60
You are ruining us.

Tiefenbach (to Kolatto). Ay, ay! I observed, that before we
sat down to supper, it was read differently.

Goetz. Why, I seemed to think so too.

Isolani. What do I care for that? Where there stand other 65
names, mine can stand too.

Tiefenbach. Before supper there was a certain proviso therein,
or short clause concerning our duties to the Emperor.

Butler (to one of the commanders). For shame, for shame!
Bethink you. What is the main business here? The question 70
now is, whether we shall keep our General, or let him retire.
One must not take these things too nicely and
over-scrupulously.

Isolani (to one of the Generals). Did the Duke make any of
these provisos when he gave you your regiment? 75

Tertsky (to Goetz). Or when he gave you the office of
army-purveyancer, which brings you in yearly a thousand pistoles!

Illo. He is a rascal who makes us out to be rogues. If
there be any one that wants satisfaction, let him say so,&mdash;I am
his man. 80

Tiefenbach. Softly, softly! 'Twas but a word or two.

Max (having read the paper gives it back). Till to-morrow,
therefore!

Illo (stammering with rage and fury, loses all command over
himself, and presents the paper to Max with one hand, and his
sword in the other). Subscribe&mdash;Judas!

Isolani. Out upon you, Illo! 85

Octavio, Tertsky, Butler (all together). Down with the sword!

[672]
Max (rushes on him suddenly and disarms him, then to Count
Tertsky). Take him off to bed.

[Max leaves the stage. Illo cursing and raving is held back by some of
the Officers, and amidst a universal confusion the curtain drops.

Octavio Piccolomini. A Valet de Chambre, with Lights.


Octavio.&mdash;&mdash;And when my son comes in, conduct him hither.
What is the hour?

Valet. 'Tis on the point of morning.

Octavio. Set down the light. We mean not to undress.
You may retire to sleep.


[Exit Valet. Octavio paces, musing, across the chamber; Max Piccolomini
enters unobserved, and looks at his father for some moments in silence.


Max. Art thou offended with me? Heaven knows 5
That odious business was no fault of mine.
'Tis true, indeed, I saw thy signature.
What thou hadst sanctioned, should not, it might seem,
Have come amiss to me. But&mdash;'tis my nature&mdash;
Thou know'st that in such matters I must follow 10
My own light, not another's.

Octavio (embraces him). Follow it,
O follow it still further, my best son!
To-night, dear boy! it hath more faithfully
Guided thee than the example of thy father.

Max. Declare thyself less darkly.

Octavio. I will do so. 15
For after what has taken place this night,
There must remain no secrets 'twixt us two. [Both seat themselves.
Max Piccolomini! what thinkest thou of
The oath that was sent round for signatures?

Max. I hold it for a thing of harmless import, 20
Although I love not these set declarations.

Octavio. And on no other ground hast thou refused
[673]
The signature they fain had wrested from thee?

Max. It was a serious business&mdash;&mdash;I was absent&mdash;
The affair itself seemed not so urgent to me. 25

Octavio. Be open, Max. Thou hadst then no suspicion?

Max. Suspicion! what suspicion? Not the least.

Octavio. Thank thy good angel, Piccolomini:
He drew thee back unconscious from the abyss.

Max. I know not what thou meanest.

Octavio. I will tell thee. 30
Fain would they have extorted from thee, son,
The sanction of thy name to villainy;
Yea, with a single flourish of thy pen,
Made thee renounce thy duty and thy honour!

Max (rises). Octavio!

Octavio. Patience! Seat yourself. Much yet 35
Hast thou to hear from me, friend!&mdash;hast for years
Lived in incomprehensible illusion.
Before thine eyes is Treason drawing out
As black a web as e'er was spun for venom:
A power of hell o'erclouds thy understanding. 40
I dare no longer stand in silence&mdash;dare
No longer see thee wandering on in darkness,
Nor pluck the bandage from thine eyes.

Max. My father!
Yet, ere thou speak'st, a moment's pause of thought!
If your disclosures should appear to be 45
Conjectures only&mdash;and almost I fear
They will be nothing further&mdash;spare them! I
Am not in that collected mood at present,
That I could listen to them quietly.

Octavio. The deeper cause thou hast to hate this light, 50
The more impatient cause have I, my son,
To force it on thee. To the innocence
And wisdom of thy heart I could have trusted thee
With calm assurance&mdash;but I see the net
Preparing&mdash;and it is thy heart itself 55
Alarms me for thine innocence&mdash;that secret,
Which thou concealest, forces mine from me.
Know, then, they are duping thee!&mdash;a most foul game
[674]
With thee and with us all&mdash;nay, hear me calmly&mdash;
The Duke even now is playing. He assumes 60
The mask, as if he would forsake the army;
And in this moment makes he preparations
That army from the Emperor to steal,
And carry it over to the enemy!

Max. That low Priest's legend I know well, but did not 65
Expect to hear it from thy mouth.

Octavio. That mouth,
From which thou hearest it at this present moment,
Doth warrant thee that it is no Priest's legend.

Max. How mere a maniac they supposed the Duke!
What, he can meditate?&mdash;the Duke?&mdash;can dream 70
That he can lure away full thirty thousand
Tried troops and true, all honourable soldiers,
More than a thousand noblemen among them,
From oaths, from duty, from their honour lure them,
And make them all unanimous to do 75
A deed that brands them scoundrels?

Octavio. Such a deed,
With such a front of infamy, the Duke
No wise desires&mdash;what he requires of us
Bears a far gentler appellation. Nothing
He wishes, but to give the Empire peace. 80
And so, because the Emperor hates this peace,
Therefore the Duke&mdash;the Duke will force him to it.
All parts of the Empire will he pacify,
And for his trouble will retain in payment
(What he has already in his gripe)&mdash;Bohemia! 85

Max. Has he, Octavio, merited of us,
That we&mdash;that we should think so vilely of him?

Octavio. What we would think is not the question here.
The affair speaks for itself&mdash;and clearest proofs!
Hear me, my son&mdash;'tis not unknown to thee, 90
In what ill credit with the Court we stand.
But little dost thou know, or guess, what tricks,
What base intrigues, what lying artifices,
Have been employed&mdash;for this sole end&mdash;to sow
Mutiny in the camp! All bands are loosed&mdash; 95
Loosed all the bands, that link the officer
To his liege Emperor, all that bind the soldier
[675]
Affectionately to the citizen.
Lawless he stands, and threateningly beleaguers
The state he's bound to guard. To such a height 100
'Tis swoln, that at this hour the Emperor
Before his armies&mdash;his own armies&mdash;trembles;
Yea, in his capital, his palace, fears
The traitor's poniards, and is meditating
To hurry off and hide his tender offspring&mdash;&mdash; 105
Not from the Swedes, not from the Lutherans&mdash;
No! from his own troops hide and hurry them!

Max. Cease, cease! thou tortur'st, shatter'st me. I know
That oft we tremble at an empty terror;
But the false phantasm brings a real misery. 110

Octavio. It is no phantasm. An intestine war,
Of all the most unnatural and cruel,
Will burst out into flames, if instantly
We do not fly and stifle it. The Generals
Are many of them long ago won over; 115
The subalterns are vacillating&mdash;whole
Regiments and garrisons are vacillating.
To foreigners our strong holds are entrusted;
To that suspected Schafgotch is the whole
Force of Silesia given up: to Tertsky 120
Five regiments, foot and horse&mdash;to Isolani,
To Illo, Kinsky, Butler, the best troops.

Max. Likewise to both of us.

Octavio. Because the Duke
Believes he has secured us&mdash;means to lure us
Still further on by splendid promises. 125
To me he portions forth the princedoms, Glatz
And Sagan; and too plain I see the angle
With which he doubts not to catch thee.

Max. No! no!
I tell thee&mdash;no!

Octavio. O open yet thine eyes!
And to what purpose think'st thou he has called us 130
Hither to Pilsen?&mdash;to avail himself
Of our advice?&mdash;O when did Friedland ever
Need our advice?&mdash;Be calm, and listen to me.
To sell ourselves are we called hither, and,
[676]
Decline we that&mdash;to be his hostages. 135
Therefore doth noble Galas stand aloof;
Thy father, too, thou would'st not have seen here,
If higher duties had not held him fettered.

Max. He makes no secret of it&mdash;needs make none&mdash;
That we're called hither for his sake&mdash;he owns it. 140
He needs our aidance to maintain himself&mdash;
He did so much for us; and 'tis but fair
That we too should do somewhat now for him.

Octavio. And know'st thou what it is which we must do?
That Illo's drunken mood betrayed it to thee. 145
Bethink thyself&mdash;what hast thou heard, what seen?
The counterfeited paper&mdash;the omission
Of that particular clause, so full of meaning,
Does it not prove, that they would bind us down
To nothing good?

Max. That counterfeited paper 150
Appears to me no other than a trick
Of Illo's own device. These underhand
Traders in great men's interests ever use
To urge and hurry all things to the extreme.
They see the Duke at variance with the court, 155
And fondly think to serve him, when they widen
The breach irreparably. Trust me, father,
The Duke knows nothing of all this.

Octavio. It grieves me
That I must dash to earth, that I must shatter
A faith so specious; but I may not spare thee! 160
For this is not a time for tenderness.
Thou must take measures, speedy ones&mdash;must act.
I therefore will confess to thee, that all
Which I've entrusted to thee now&mdash;that all
Which seems to thee so unbelievable, 165
That&mdash;yes, I will tell thee&mdash;Max! I had it all
From his own mouth&mdash;from the Duke's mouth I had it.

Max. No!&mdash;no!&mdash;never!

Octavio. Himself confided to me
What I, 'tis true, had long before discovered
By other means&mdash;himself confided to me, 170
That 'twas his settled plan to join the Swedes;
And, at the head of the united armies,
[677]
Compel the Emperor&mdash;

Max. He is passionate.
The Court has stung him&mdash;he is sore all over
With injuries and affronts; and in a moment 175
Of irritation, what if he, for once,
Forgot himself? He's an impetuous man.

Octavio. Nay, in cold blood he did confess this to me:
And having construed my astonishment
Into a scruple of his power, he shewed me 180
His written evidences&mdash;shewed me letters,
Both from the Saxon and the Swede, that gave
Promise of aidance, and defin'd the amount.

Max. It cannot be!&mdash;can not be! can not be!
Dost thou not see, it cannot! 185
Thou wouldest of necessity have shewn him
Such horror, such deep loathing&mdash;that or he
Had taken thee for his better genius, or
Thou stood'st not now a living man before me&mdash;

Octavio. I have laid open my objections to him, 190
Dissuaded him with pressing earnestness;
But my abhorrence, the full sentiment
Of my whole heart&mdash;that I have still kept sacred
To my own consciousness.

Max. And thou hast been
So treacherous? That looks not like my father! 195
I trusted not thy words, when thou didst tell me
Evil of him; much less can I now do it,
That thou calumniatest thy own self.

Octavio. I did not thrust myself into his secrecy.

Max. Uprightness merited his confidence. 200

Octavio. He was no longer worthy of sincerity.

Max. Dissimulation, sure, was still less worthy
Of thee, Octavio!

Octavio. Gave I him a cause
To entertain a scruple of my honour?

Max. That he did not, evinced his confidence. 205

Octavio. Dear son, it is not always possible
Still to preserve that infant purity
Which the voice teaches in our inmost heart.
Still in alarm, for ever on the watch
Against the wiles of wicked men, e'en Virtue 210
[678]
Will sometimes bear away her outward robes
Soiled in the wrestle with Iniquity.
This is the curse of every evil deed,
That, propagating still, it brings forth evil.
I do not cheat my better soul with sophisms: 215
I but perform my orders; the Emperor
Prescribes my conduct to me. Dearest boy,
Far better were it, doubtless, if we all
Obeyed the heart at all times; but so doing,
In this our present sojourn with bad men, 220
We must abandon many an honest object.
'Tis now our call to serve the Emperor,
By what means he can best be served&mdash;the heart
May whisper what it will&mdash;this is our call!

Max. It seems a thing appointed, that to-day 225
I should not comprehend, not understand thee.
The Duke thou say'st did honestly pour out
His heart to thee, but for an evil purpose;
And thou dishonestly hast cheated him
For a good purpose! Silence, I entreat thee&mdash; 230
My friend thou stealest not from me&mdash;
Let me not lose my father!

Octavio. As yet thou know'st not all, my son. I have
Yet somewhat to disclose to thee. [After a pause.
Duke Friedland
Hath made his preparations. He relies 235
Upon his stars. He deems us unprovided,
And thinks to fall upon us by surprise.
Yea, in his dream of hope, he grasps already
The golden circle in his hand. He errs.
We too have been in action&mdash;he but grasps 240
His evil fate, most evil, most mysterious!

Max. O nothing rash, my sire! By all that's good
Let me invoke thee&mdash;no precipitation!

Octavio. With light tread stole he on his evil way,
With light tread hath Vengeance stole on after him. 245
Unseen she stands already, dark behind him&mdash;
But one step more&mdash;he shudders in her grasp!
Thou hast seen Questenberg with me. As yet
Thou know'st but his ostensible commission;
He brought with him a private one, my son! 250
[679]
And that was for me only.

Max. May I know it?

Octavio (seizes the patent). Max! [A pause.
&mdash;&mdash;In this disclosure place I in thy hands
The Empire's welfare and thy father's life.
Dear to thy inmost heart is Wallenstein:
A powerful tie of love, of veneration, 255
Hath knit thee to him from thy earliest youth.
Thou nourishest the wish.&mdash;O let me still
Anticipate thy loitering confidence!
The hope thou nourishest to knit thyself
Yet closer to him&mdash;&mdash;

Max. Father&mdash;&mdash;

Octavio. O my son! 260
I trust thy heart undoubtingly. But am I
Equally sure of thy collectedness?
Wilt thou be able, with calm countenance,
To enter this man's presence, when that I
Have trusted to thee his whole fate?

Max. According 265
As thou dost trust me, father, with his crime.


[Octavio takes a paper out of his escrutoire, and gives it to him.


Max. What? how? a full Imperial patent!

Octavio. Read it.

Max (just glances on it). Duke Friedland sentenced and condemned!

Octavio. Even so.

Max (throws down the paper). O this is too much! O unhappy error! 270

Octavio. Read on. Collect thyself.

Max (after he has read further, with a look of affright and
astonishment on his father). How! what! Thou! thou!

Octavio. But for the present moment, till the King
Of Hungary may safely join the army,
Is the command assigned to me.

Max. And think'st thou,
Dost thou believe, that thou wilt tear it from him? 275
O never hope it!&mdash;Father! father! father!
An inauspicious office is enjoined thee.
This paper here&mdash;this! and wilt thou enforce it?
[680]
The mighty in the middle of his host,
Surrounded by his thousands, him would'st thou 280
Disarm&mdash;degrade! Thou art lost, both thou and all of us.

Octavio. What hazard I incur thereby, I know.
In the great hand of God I stand. The Almighty
Will cover with his shield the Imperial house,
And shatter, in his wrath, the work of darkness. 285
The Emperor hath true servants still; and even
Here in the camp, there are enough brave men,
Who for the good cause will fight gallantly.
The faithful have been warned&mdash;the dangerous
Are closely watched. I wait but the first step, 290
And then immediately&mdash;&mdash;

Max. What! on suspicion?
Immediately?

Octavio. The Emperor is no tyrant.
The deed alone he'll punish, not the wish.
The Duke hath yet his destiny in his power.
Let him but leave the treason uncompleted, 295
He will be silently displaced from office,
And make way to his Emperor's royal son.
An honourable exile to his castles
Will be a benefaction to him rather
Than punishment. But the first open step&mdash;&mdash; 300

Max. What callest thou such a step? A wicked step
Ne'er will he take; but thou mightest easily,
Yea, thou hast done it, misinterpret him.

Octavio. Nay, howsoever punishable were
Duke Friedland's purposes, yet still the steps 305
Which he hath taken openly, permit
A mild construction. It is my intention
To leave this paper wholly uninforced
Till some act is committed which convicts him
Of a high-treason, without doubt or plea, 310
And that shall sentence him.

Max. But who the judge?

Octavio. Thyself.

Max. For ever, then, this paper will lie idle.

Octavio. Too soon, I fear, its powers must all be proved.
After the counter-promise of this evening, 315
It cannot be but he must deem himself
Secure of the majority with us;
[681]
And of the army's general sentiment
He hath a pleasing proof in that petition
Which thou delivered'st to him from the regiments. 320
Add this too&mdash;I have letters that the Rhinegrave
Hath changed his route, and travels by forced marches
To the Bohemian Forest. What this purports,
Remains unknown; and, to confirm suspicion,
This night a Swedish nobleman arrived here. 325

Max. I have thy word. Thou'lt not proceed to action
Before thou hast convinced me&mdash;me myself.

Octavio. Is it possible? Still, after all thou know'st,
Canst thou believe still in his innocence?

Max. Thy judgment may mistake; my heart can not. 330
These reasons might expound thy spirit or mine;
But they expound not Friedland&mdash;I have faith:
For as he knits his fortunes to the stars,
Even so doth he resemble them in secret,
Wonderful, still inexplicable courses! 335
Trust me, they do him wrong. All will be solved.
These smokes, at once, will kindle into flame&mdash;
The edges of this black and stormy cloud
Will brighten suddenly, and we shall view
The Unapproachable glide out in splendour. 340

Octavio. I will await it.

Scene II

Octavio and Max as before. To them the Valet of the Chamber.


Octavio. How now, then?

Valet. A dispatch is at the door.

Octavio. So early? From whom comes he then? Who is it?

Valet. That he refused to tell me.

Octavio. Lead him in:
And, hark you&mdash;let it not transpire.
[Exit Valet&mdash;the Cornet steps in.

Octavio. Ha! Cornet&mdash;is it you? and from Count Galas? 5
Give me your letters.

Cornet. The Lieutenant-General
Trusted it not to letters.

Octavio. And what is it?

Cornet. He bade me tell you&mdash;Dare I speak openly here?


[682]


Octavio. My son knows all.

Cornet. We have him.

Octavio. Whom?

Cornet. Sesina,
The old negotiator.

Octavio. And you have him? 10

Cornet. In the Bohemian Forest Captain Mohrbrand
Found and secured him yester morning early:
He was proceeding then to Regenspurg,
And on him were dispatches for the Swede.

Octavio. And the dispatches&mdash;&mdash;

Cornet. The Lieutenant-General 15
Sent them that instant to Vienna, and
The prisoner with them.

Octavio. This is, indeed, a tiding!
That fellow is a precious casket to us,
Enclosing weighty things.&mdash;Was much found on him?

Cornet. I think, six packets, with Count Tertsky's arms. 20

Octavio. None in the Duke's own hand?

Cornet. Not that I know.

Octavio. And old Sesina?

Cornet. He was sorely frightened,
When it was told him he must to Vienna.
But the Count Altringer bade him take heart,
Would he but make a full and free confession. 25

Octavio. Is Altringer then with your Lord? I heard
That he lay sick at Linz.

Cornet. These three days past
He's with my master, the Lieutenant-General,
At Frauenberg. Already have they sixty
Small companies together, chosen men; 30
Respectfully they greet you with assurances,
That they are only waiting your commands.

Octavio. In a few days may great events take place.
And when must you return?

Cornet. I wait your orders.

Octavio. Remain till evening.


[Cornet signifies his assent and obeisance, and is going.


Octavio. No one saw you&mdash;ha? 35

Cornet. No living creature. Through the cloister wicket
The Capuchins, as usual, let me in.

Octavio. Go, rest your limbs, and keep yourself concealed.
I hold it probable, that yet ere evening
[683]I shall dispatch you. The development 40
Of this affair approaches: ere the day,
That even now is dawning in the heaven,
Ere this eventful day hath set, the lot
That must decide our fortunes will be drawn.
[Exit Cornet.

Scene III

Octavio and Max Piccolomini.


Octavio. Well&mdash;and what now, son? All will soon be clear;
For all, I'm certain, went through that Sesina.

Max. I will procure me light a shorter way.
Farewell.

Octavio. Where now?&mdash;Remain here.

Max. To the Duke. 5

Octavio. What&mdash;&mdash;

Max. If thou hast believed that I shall act
A part in this thy play&mdash;&mdash;
Thou hast miscalculated on me grievously.
My way must be straight on. True with the tongue, 10
False with the heart&mdash;I may not, cannot be:
Nor can I suffer that a man should trust me&mdash;
As his friend trust me&mdash;and then lull my conscience
With such low pleas as these:&mdash;'I ask'd him not&mdash;
He did it all at his own hazard&mdash;and 15
My mouth has never lied to him.'&mdash;No, no!
What a friend takes me for, that I must be.
&mdash;I'll to the Duke; ere yet this day is ended
Will I demand of him that he do save
His good name from the world, and with one stride 20
Break through and rend this fine-spun web of yours.
He can, he will!&mdash;I still am his believer.
Yet I'll not pledge myself, but that those letters
May furnish you, perchance, with proofs against him.
How far may not this Tertsky have proceeded&mdash; 25
What may not he himself too have permitted
Himself to do, to snare the enemy,
The laws of war excusing? Nothing, save
His own mouth shall convict him&mdash;nothing less!
And face to face will I go question him. 30


[684]


Octavio. Thou wilt?

Max. I will, as sure as this heart beats.

Octavio. I have, indeed, miscalculated on thee.
I calculated on a prudent son,
Who would have blest the hand beneficent
That plucked him back from the abyss&mdash;and lo! 35
A fascinated being I discover,
Whom his two eyes befool, whom passion wilders,
Whom not the broadest light of noon can heal.
Go, question him!&mdash;Be mad enough, I pray thee.
The purpose of thy father, of thy Emperor, 40
Go, give it up free booty:&mdash;Force me, drive me
To an open breach before the time. And now,
Now that a miracle of heaven had guarded
My secret purpose even to this hour,
And laid to sleep Suspicion's piercing eyes, 45
Let me have lived to see that mine own son,
With frantic enterprise, annihilates
My toilsome labours and state-policy.

Max. Aye&mdash;this state-policy! O how I curse it!
You will some time, with your state-policy, 50
Compel him to the measure: it may happen,
Because ye are determined that he is guilty,
Guilty ye'll make him. All retreat cut off,
You close up every outlet, hem him in
Narrower and narrower, till at length ye force him&mdash; 55
Yes, ye,&mdash;ye force him, in his desperation,
To set fire to his prison. Father! Father!
That never can end well&mdash;it cannot&mdash;will not!
And let it be decided as it may,
I see with boding heart the near approach 60
Of an ill-starred unblest catastrophe.
For this great Monarch-spirit, if he fall,
Will drag a world into the ruin with him.
And as a ship (that midway on the ocean
Takes fire) at once, and with a thunder-burst 65
Explodes, and with itself shoots out its crew
In smoke and ruin betwixt sea and heaven;
So will he, falling, draw down in his fall
All us, who're fixed and mortised to his fortune.
Deem of it what thou wilt; but pardon me, 70
[685]
That I must bear me on in my own way.
All must remain pure betwixt him and me;
And, ere the day-light dawns, it must be known
Which I must lose&mdash;my father, or my friend.
[During his exit the curtain drops.

ACT IV

Scene I

Scene&mdash;A Room fitted up for astrological Labours, and provided with
celestial Charts, with Globes, Telescopes, Quadrants, and other
mathematical Instruments.&mdash;Seven Colossal Figures, representing the
Planets, each with a transparent Star of a different Colour on its Head,
stand in a Semi-circle in the Back-ground, so that Mars and Saturn are
nearest the Eye.&mdash;The remainder of the Scene, and its Disposition, is
given in the Fourth Scene of the Second Act.&mdash;There must be a Curtain
over the Figures, which may be dropped, and conceal them on Occasions.

[In the Fifth Scene of this Act it must be dropped; but in the Seventh
Scene, it must be again drawn up wholly or in part.]

Wallenstein at a black Table, on which a Speculum Astrologicum is
described with Chalk. Seni is taking Observations through a window.


Wallenstein. All well&mdash;and now let it be ended, Seni.&mdash;Come,
The dawn commences, and Mars rules the hour.
We must give o'er the operation. Come,
We know enough.

Seni. Your Highness must permit me
Just to contemplate Venus. She's now rising: 5
Like as a sun, so shines she in the east.

Wallenstein. She is at present in her perigee,
And shoots down now her strongest influences.
[Contemplating the figure on the table.
Auspicious aspect! fateful in conjunction,
At length the mighty three corradiate; 10
And the two stars of blessing, Jupiter
And Venus, take between them the malignant
Slily-malicious Mars, and thus compel
Into my service that old mischief-founder;
For long he viewed me hostilely, and ever 15
[686]
With beam oblique, or perpendicular,
Now in the Quartile, now in the Secundan,
Shot his red lightnings at my stars, disturbing
Their blessed influences and sweet aspects.
Now they have conquered the old enemy, 20
And bring him in the heavens a prisoner to me.

Seni (who has come down from the window). And in a corner house, your Highness&mdash;think of that!
That makes each influence of double strength.

Wallenstein. And sun and moon, too, in the Sextile aspect,
The soft light with the vehement&mdash;so I love it. 25
Sol is the heart, Luna the head of heaven,
Bold be the plan, fiery the execution.

Seni. And both the mighty Lumina by no
Maleficus affronted. Lo! Saturnus,
Innocuous, powerless, in cadente Domo. 30

Wallenstein. The empire of Saturnus is gone by;
Lord of the secret birth of things is he;
Within the lap of earth, and in the depths
Of the imagination dominates;
And his are all things that eschew the light. 35
The time is o'er of brooding and contrivance;
For Jupiter, the lustrous, lordeth now,
And the dark work, complete of preparation,
He draws by force into the realm of light.
Now must we hasten on to action, ere 40
The scheme, and most auspicious positure
Parts o'er my head, and takes once more its flight;
For the heavens journey still, and sojourn not.
[There are knocks at the door.
There's some one knocking there. See who it is.

Tertsky (from without). Open, and let me in.

Wallenstein. Aye&mdash;'tis Tertsky. 45
What is there of such urgence? We are busy.

Tertsky (from without). Lay all aside at present, I entreat you.
It suffers no delaying.

Wallenstein. Open, Seni!


[While Seni opens the doors for Tertsky, Wallenstein draws the curtain
over the figures.


Tertsky (enters). Hast thou already heard it? He is taken.
Galas has given him up to the Emperor. 50


[Seni draws off the black table, and exit.



LINENOTES:

[14] my 1800, 1828, 1829.

[26] Sol .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Luna 1800, 1828, 1829.



[687]
Scene II

Wallenstein, Count Tertsky.


Wallenstein (to Tertsky). Who has been taken?&mdash;Who is given up?

Tertsky. The man who knows our secrets, who knows every
Negotiation with the Swede and Saxon,
Through whose hands all and every thing has passed&mdash;

Wallenstein (drawing back). Nay, not Sesina?&mdash;Say, No! I entreat thee. 5

Tertsky. All on his road for Regenspurg to the Swede
He was plunged down upon by Galas' agent,
Who had been long in ambush, lurking for him.
There must have been found on him my whole packet
To Thur, to Kinsky, to Oxenstirn, to Arnheim: 10
All this is in their hands; they have now an insight
Into the whole&mdash;our measures, and our motives.




Scene III

To them enters Illo.


Illo (to Tertsky). Has he heard it?

Tertsky. He has heard it.

Illo (to Wallenstein). Thinkest thou still
To make thy peace with the Emperor, to regain
His confidence?&mdash;E'en were it now thy wish
To abandon all thy plans, yet still they know
What thou hast wished; then forwards thou must press; 5
Retreat is now no longer in thy power.

Tertsky. They have documents against us, and in hands,
Which shew beyond all power of contradiction&mdash;

Wallenstein. Of my hand-writing&mdash;no iota. Thee
I punish for thy lies.

Illo. And thou believest, 10
That what this man, that what thy sister's husband,
Did in thy name, will not stand on thy reck'ning?
His word must pass for thy word with the Swede,
And not with those that hate thee at Vienna.

Tertsky. In writing thou gav'st nothing&mdash;But bethink thee, 15
How far thou ventured'st by word of mouth
[688]
With this Sesina? And will he be silent?
If he can save himself by yielding up
Thy secret purposes, will he retain them?

Illo. Thyself dost not conceive it possible; 20
And since they now have evidence authentic
How far thou hast already gone, speak!&mdash;tell us,
What art thou waiting for? thou canst no longer
Keep thy command; and beyond hope of rescue
Thou'rt lost, if thou resign'st it.

Wallenstein. In the army 25
Lies my security. The army will not
Abandon me. Whatever they may know,
The power is mine, and they must gulp it down&mdash;
And substitute I caution for my fealty,
They must be satisfied, at least appear so. 30

Illo. The army, Duke, is thine now&mdash;for this moment&mdash;
'Tis thine: but think with terror on the slow,
The quiet power of time. From open violence
The attachment of thy soldiery secures thee
To-day&mdash;to-morrow; but grant'st thou them a respite, 35
Unheard, unseen, they'll undermine that love
On which thou now dost feel so firm a footing,
With wily theft will draw away from thee
One after the other&mdash;&mdash;

Wallenstein. 'Tis a curs&eacute;d accident!

Illo. O, I will call it a most blessed one, 40
If it work on thee as it ought to do,
Hurry thee on to action&mdash;to decision.
The Swedish General&mdash;&mdash;

Wallenstein. He's arrived! Know'st thou
What his commission is&mdash;&mdash;

Illo. To thee alone
Will he entrust the purpose of his coming. 45

Wallenstein. A curs&eacute;d, curs&eacute;d accident! Yes, yes,
Sesina knows too much, and won't be silent.

Tertsky. He's a Bohemian fugitive and rebel,
His neck is forfeit. Can he save himself
At thy cost, think you he will scruple it? 50
And if they put him to the torture, will he,
Will he, that dastardling, have strength enough&mdash;&mdash;

Wallenstein. Their confidence is lost&mdash;irreparably!
[689]
And I may act what way I will, I shall
Be and remain for ever in their thought 55
A traitor to my country. How sincerely
Soever I return back to my duty,
It will no longer help me&mdash;&mdash;

Illo. Ruin thee,
That it will do! Not thy fidelity,
Thy weakness will be deemed the sole occasion&mdash;&mdash; 60

Wallenstein. What! I must realize it now in earnest,
Because I toy'd too freely with the thought?
Accurs&eacute;d he who dallies with a devil!
And must I&mdash;I must realize it now&mdash;
Now, while I have the power, it must take place? 65

Illo. Now&mdash;now&mdash;ere they can ward and parry it!

Wallenstein (looking at the paper of signatures). I have the Generals' word&mdash;a written promise!
Max Piccolomini stands not here&mdash;how's that?

Tertsky. It was&mdash;&mdash;he fancied&mdash;&mdash;

Illo. Mere self-willedness.
There needed no such thing 'twixt him and you. 70

Wallenstein. He is quite right&mdash;there needeth no such thing.
The regiments, too, deny to march for Flanders&mdash;
Have sent me in a paper of remonstrance,
And openly resist the Imperial orders.
The first step to revolt's already taken. 75

Illo. Believe me, thou wilt find it far more easy
To lead them over to the enemy
Than to the Spaniard.

Wallenstein. I will hear, however,
What the Swede has to say to me.

Illo (to Tertsky). Go, call him!
He stands without the door in waiting.

Wallenstein. Stay! 80
Stay yet a little. It hath taken me
All by surprise,&mdash;it came too quick upon me;
'Tis wholly novel, that an accident,
With its dark lordship, and blind agency,
Should force me on with it.

Illo. First hear him only, 85
And after weigh it.
[Exeunt Tertsky and Illo.

Scene IV


Wallenstein. Is it possible?
Is't so? I can no longer what I would?
No longer draw back at my liking? I
Must do the deed, because I thought of it,
And fed this heart here with a dream? Because 5
I did not scowl temptation from my presence,
Dallied with thoughts of possible fulfilment,
Commenced no movement, left all time uncertain,
And only kept the road, the access open?
By the great God of Heaven! it was not 10
My serious meaning, it was ne'er resolve.
I but amused myself with thinking of it.
The free-will tempted me, the power to do
Or not to do it.&mdash;Was it criminal
To make the fancy minister to hope, 15
To fill the air with pretty toys of air,
And clutch fantastic sceptres moving t'ward me?
Was not the will kept free? Beheld I not
The road of duty close beside me&mdash;but
One little step, and once more I was in it! 20
Where am I? Whither have I been transported?
No road, no track behind me, but a wall,
Impenetrable, insurmountable,
Rises obedient to the spells I muttered
And meant not&mdash;my own doings tower behind me. 25
A punishable man I seem, the guilt,
Try what I will, I cannot roll off from me;
The equivocal demeanour of my life
Bears witness on my prosecutor's party;
And even my purest acts from purest motives 30
Suspicion poisons with malicious gloss.
Were I that thing, for which I pass, that traitor,
A goodly outside I had sure reserved,
Had drawn the coverings thick and double round me,
Been calm and chary of my utterance. 35
But being conscious of the innocence
Of my intent, my uncorrupted will,
I gave way to my humours, to my passion:
Bold were my words, because my deeds were not.
[691]
Now every planless measure, chance event, 40
The threat of rage, the vaunt of joy and triumph,
And all the May-games of a heart o'erflowing,
Will they connect, and weave them all together
Into one web of treason; all will be plan,
My eye ne'er absent from the far-off mark, 45
Step tracing step, each step a politic progress;
And out of all they'll fabricate a charge
So specious, that I must myself stand dumb.
I am caught in my own net, and only force,
Naught but a sudden rent can liberate me. 50
How else! since that the heart's unbiass'd instinct
Impelled me to the daring deed, which now
Necessity, self-preservation, orders.
Stern is the On-look of Necessity,
Not without shudder many a human hand 55
Grasps the mysterious urn of destiny.
My deed was mine, remaining in my bosom,
Once suffered to escape from its safe corner
Within the heart, its nursery and birthplace,
Sent forth into the Foreign, it belongs 60
For ever to those sly malicious powers
Whom never art of man conciliated.
What is thy enterprize? thy aim? thy object?
Hast honestly confessed it to thyself?
Power seated on a quiet throne thou'dst shake, 65
Power on an ancient consecrated throne,
Strong in possession, founded in old custom;
Power by a thousand tough and stringy roots
Fixed to the people's pious nursery-faith.
This, this will be no strife of strength with strength. 70
That feared I not. I brave each combatant,
Whom I can look on, fixing eye to eye,
Who full himself of courage kindles courage
In me too. 'Tis a foe invisible,
The which I fear&mdash;a fearful enemy, 75
Which in the human heart opposes me,
By its coward fear alone made fearful to me.
Not that, which full of life, instinct with power,
[692]
Makes known its present being, that is not
The true, the perilously formidable. 80
O no! it is the common, the quite common,
The thing of an eternal yesterday,
What ever was, and evermore returns,
Sterling to-morrow, for to-day 'twas sterling!
For of the wholly common is man made, 85
And custom is his nurse! Woe then to them,
Who lay irreverent hands upon his old
House furniture, the dear inheritance
From his forefathers. For time consecrates;
And what is grey with age becomes religion. 90
Be in possession, and thou hast the right,
And sacred will the many guard it for thee!
[To the Page, who here enters.
The Swedish officer?&mdash;Well, let him enter.

[The Page exit, Wallenstein fixes his eye in deep thought on the
door.

Yet is it pure&mdash;as yet!&mdash;the crime has come
Not o'er this threshold yet&mdash;so slender is 95
The boundary that divideth life's two paths.

Scene V

Wallenstein and Wrangel.


Wallenstein. Your name is Wrangel?

Wrangel. Gustave Wrangel, General
Of the Sudermanian Blues.

Wallenstein. It was a Wrangel
Who injured me materially at Stralsund,
And by his brave resistance was the cause
Of the opposition which that sea-port made. 5

Wrangel. It was the doing of the element
With which you fought, my Lord! and not my merit.
The Baltic Neptune did assert his freedom,
The sea and land, it seemed, were not to serve
One and the same.

Wallenstein (makes a motion for him to take a seat, and seats himself).
And where are your credentials? 10
Come you provided with full powers, Sir General?

Wrangel. There are so many scruples yet to solve&mdash;&mdash;


[693]


Wallenstein (having read the credentials). An able letter!&mdash;Ay&mdash;he is a prudent,
Intelligent master, whom you serve, Sir General!
The Chancellor writes me, that he but fulfils 15
His late departed Sovereign's own idea
In helping me to the Bohemian crown.

Wrangel. He says the truth. Our great King, now in heaven,
Did ever deem most highly of your Grace's
Pre-eminent sense and military genius; 20
And always the commanding Intellect,
He said, should have command, and be the King.

Wallenstein. Yes, he might say it safely.&mdash;General Wrangel,
[Taking his hand.
Come, fair and open&mdash;Trust me, I was always
A Swede at heart. Ey! that did you experience 25
Both in Silesia and at Nuremburg;
I had you often in my power, and let you
Always slip out by some back door or other.
'Tis this for which the Court can ne'er forgive me,
Which drives me to this present step: and since 30
Our interests so run in one direction,
E'en let us have a thorough confidence
Each in the other.

Wrangel. Confidence will come
Has each but only first security.

Wallenstein. The Chancellor still, I see, does not quite trust me; 35
And, I confess&mdash;the gain does not wholly lie
To my advantage&mdash;Without doubt he thinks
If I can play false with the Emperor,
Who is my Sov'reign, I can do the like
With the enemy, and that the one too were 40
Sooner to be forgiven me than the other.
Is not this your opinion too, Sir General?

Wrangel. I have here an office merely, no opinion.

Wallenstein. The Emperor hath urged me to the uttermost.
I can no longer honourably serve him. 45
For my security, in self-defence,
I take this hard step, which my conscience blames.

Wrangel. That I believe. So far would no one go
Who was not forced to it. [After a pause.
What may have impelled
[694]
Your princely Highness in this wise to act 50
Toward your Sovereign Lord and Emperor,
Beseems not us to expound or criticize.
The Swede is fighting for his good old cause.
With his good sword and conscience. This concurrence,
This opportunity, is in our favour, 55
And all advantages in war are lawful.
We take what offers without questioning;
And if all have its due and just proportions&mdash;&mdash;

Wallenstein. Of what then are ye doubting? Of my will?
Or of my power? I pledged me to the Chancellor, 60
Would he trust me with sixteen thousand men,
That I would instantly go over to them
With eighteen thousand of the Emperor's troops.

Wrangel. Your Grace is known to be a mighty war-chief,
To be a second Attila and Pyrrhus. 65
'Tis talked of still with fresh astonishment,
How some years past, beyond all human faith,
You called an army forth, like a creation:
But yet&mdash;&mdash;

Wallenstein. But yet?

Wrangel. But still the Chancellor thinks,
It might yet be an easier thing from nothing 70
To call forth sixty thousand men of battle,
Than to persuade one sixtieth part of them&mdash;

Wallenstein. What now? Out with it, friend!

Wrangel. To break their oaths.

Wallenstein. And he thinks so?&mdash;He judges like a Swede,
And like a Protestant. You Lutherans 75
Fight for your Bible. You are interested
About the cause; and with your hearts you follow
Your banners.&mdash;Among you, whoe'er deserts
To the enemy, hath broken covenant
With two Lords at one time.&mdash;We've no such fancies. 80

Wrangel. Great God in Heaven! Have then the people here
No house and home, no fire-side, no altar?

Wallenstein. I will explain that to you, how it stands&mdash;
The Austrian has a country, ay, and loves it,
And has good cause to love it&mdash;but this army, 85
That calls itself the Imperial, this that houses
Here in Bohemia, this has none&mdash;no country;
[695]
This is an outcast of all foreign lands,
Unclaimed by town or tribe, to whom belongs
Nothing, except the universal sun. 90

Wrangel. But then the Nobles and the Officers?
Such a desertion, such a felony,
It is without example, my Lord Duke,
In the world's history.

Wallenstein. They are all mine&mdash;
Mine unconditionally&mdash;mine on all terms. 95
Not me, your own eyes you must trust.


[He gives him the paper containing the written oath. Wrangel reads it
through, and, having read it, lays it on the table, remaining silent.


So then?
Now comprehend you?

Wrangel. Comprehend who can!
My Lord Duke; I will let the mask drop&mdash;yes!
I've full powers for a final settlement.
The Rhinegrave stands but four days' march from here 100
With fifteen thousand men, and only waits
For orders to proceed and join your army.
Those orders I give out, immediately
We're compromised.

Wallenstein. What asks the Chancellor?

Wrangel. Twelve Regiments, every man a Swede&mdash;my head 105
The warranty&mdash;and all might prove at last
Only false play&mdash;&mdash;

Wallenstein (starting). Sir Swede!

Wrangel. Am therefore forced
T' insist thereon, that he do formally,
Irrevocably break with the Emperor,
Else not a Swede is trusted to Duke Friedland. 110

Wallenstein. Come, brief and open! What is the demand?

Wrangel. That he forthwith disarm the Spanish regiments
Attached to the Emperor, that he seize Prague,
And to the Swedes give up that city, with
The strong pass Egra.

Wallenstein. That is much indeed! 115
Prague!&mdash;Egra's granted&mdash;But&mdash;but Prague!&mdash;'Twon't do.
I give you every security
[696]
Which you may ask of me in common reason&mdash;
But Prague&mdash;Bohemia&mdash;these, Sir General,
I can myself protect.

Wrangel. We doubt it not. 120
But 'tis not the protection that is now
Our sole concern. We want security,
That we shall not expend our men and money
All to no purpose.

Wallenstein. 'Tis but reasonable.

Wrangel. And till we are indemnified, so long 125
Stays Prague in pledge.

Wallenstein. Then trust you us so little?

Wrangel (rising). The Swede, if he would treat well with the German,
Must keep a sharp look-out. We have been called
Over the Baltic, we have saved the empire
From ruin&mdash;with our best blood have we seal'd 130
The liberty of faith, and gospel truth.
But now already is the benefaction
No longer felt, the load alone is felt.&mdash;&mdash;
Ye look askance with evil eye upon us,
As foreigners, intruders in the empire, 135
And would fain send us, with some paltry sum
Of money, home again to our old forests.
No, no! my Lord Duke! no!&mdash;it never was
For Judas' pay, for chinking gold and silver,
That we did leave our King by the Great Stone.[696:1] 140
No, not for gold and silver have there bled
So many of our Swedish Nobles&mdash;neither
Will we, with empty laurels for our payment,
Hoist sail for our own country. Citizens
Will we remain upon the soil, the which 145
Our Monarch conquered for himself, and died.

Wallenstein. Help to keep down the common enemy,
And the fair border land must needs be yours.

Wrangel. But when the common enemy lies vanquished,
Who knits together our new friendship then? 150
We know, Duke Friedland! though perhaps the Swede
Ought not t' have known it, that you carry on
[697]
Secret negotiations with the Saxons.
Who is our warranty, that we are not
The sacrifices in those articles 155
Which 'tis thought needful to conceal from us?

Wallenstein (rises). Think you of something better, Gustave Wrangel!
Of Prague no more.

Wrangel. Here my commission ends.

Wallenstein. Surrender up to you my capital!
Far liever would I face about, and step 160
Back to my Emperor.

Wrangel. If time yet permits&mdash;&mdash;

Wallenstein. That lies with me, even now, at any hour.

Wrangel. Some days ago, perhaps. To-day, no longer,
No longer since Sesina is a prisoner.
My Lord Duke, hear me&mdash;We believe that you 165
At present do mean honourably by us.
Since yesterday we're sure of that&mdash;and now
This paper warrants for the troops, there's nothing
Stands in the way of our full confidence.
Prague shall not part us. Hear! The Chancellor 170
Contents himself with Albstadt, to your Grace
He gives up Ratschin and the narrow side,
But Egra above all must open to us,
Ere we can think of any junction.

Wallenstein. You,
You therefore must I trust, and you not me? 175
I will consider of your proposition.

Wrangel. I must entreat, that your consideration
Occupy not too long a time. Already
Has this negotiation, my Lord Duke!
Crept on into the second year. If nothing 180
Is settled this time, will the Chancellor
Consider it as broken off for ever.

Wallenstein. Ye press me hard. A measure, such as this,
Ought to be thought of.

Wrangel. Ay! but think of this too,
That sudden action only can procure it 185
Success&mdash;think first of this, your Highness.
[Exit Wrangel.

Scene VI

Wallenstein, Tertsky, and Illo (re-enter).


Illo. Is't all right?

Tertsky. Are you compromised?

Illo. This Swede
Went smiling from you. Yes! you're compromised.

Wallenstein. As yet is nothing settled: and (well weighed)
I feel myself inclined to leave it so.

Tertsky. How? What is that?

Wallenstein. Come on me what will come, 5
The doing evil to avoid an evil
Cannot be good!

Tertsky. Nay, but bethink you, Duke?

Wallenstein. To live upon the mercy of these Swedes!
Of these proud-hearted Swedes! I could not bear it.

Illo. Goest thou as fugitive, as mendicant? 10
Bringest thou not more to them than thou receivest?

Scene VII

To these enter the Countess Tertsky.


Wallenstein. Who sent for you? There is no business here
For women.

Countess. I am come to bid you joy.

Wallenstein. Use thy authority, Tertsky, bid her go.

Countess. Come I perhaps too early? I hope not.

Wallenstein. Set not this tongue upon me, I entreat you. 5
You know it is the weapon that destroys me.
I am routed, if a woman but attack me.
I cannot traffic in the trade of words
With that unreasoning sex.

Countess. I had already
Given the Bohemians a king.

Wallenstein. They have one, 10
In consequence, no doubt.

Countess. Ha! what new scruple?

Tertsky. The Duke will not.

Countess. He will not what he must!

Illo. It lies with you now. Try. For I am silenced,
When folks begin to talk to me of conscience,
And of fidelity.

Countess. How? then, when all 15
[699]
Lay in the far-off distance, when the road
Stretched out before thine eyes interminably,
Then hadst thou courage and resolve; and now,
Now that the dream is being realized,
The purpose ripe, the issue ascertained, 20
Dost thou begin to play the dastard now?
Planned merely, 'tis a common felony;
Accomplished, an immortal undertaking:
And with success comes pardon hand in hand;
For all event is God's arbitrement. 25

Servant (enters). The Colonel Piccolomini.

Countess. &mdash;Must wait.

Wallenstein. I cannot see him now. Another time.

Servant. But for two minutes he entreats an audience.
Of the most urgent nature is his business.

Wallenstein. Who knows what he may bring us? I will hear him. 30

Countess. Urgent for him, no doubt; but thou mayest wait.

Wallenstein. What is it?

Countess. Thou shalt be informed hereafter.
First let the Swede and thee be compromised. [Exit Servant.

Wallenstein. If there were yet a choice! if yet some milder
Way of escape were possible&mdash;I still 35
Will choose it, and avoid the last extreme.

Countess. Desir'st thou nothing further? Such a way
Lies still before thee. Send this Wrangel off.
Forget thou thy old hopes, cast far away
All thy past life; determine to commence 40
A new one. Virtue hath her heroes too,
As well as Fame and Fortune.&mdash;To Vienna&mdash;
Hence&mdash;to the Emperor&mdash;kneel before the throne;
Take a full coffer with thee&mdash;say aloud,
Thou did'st but wish to prove thy fealty; 45
Thy whole intention but to dupe the Swede.

Illo. For that too 'tis too late. They know too much.
He would but bear his own head to the block.

Countess. I fear not that. They have not evidence
To attaint him legally, and they avoid 50
The avowal of an arbitrary power.
They'll let the Duke resign without disturbance.
I see how all will end. The King of Hungary
[700]
Makes his appearance, and 'twill of itself
Be understood, that then the Duke retires. 55
There will not want a formal declaration.
The young King will administer the oath
To the whole army; and so all returns
To the old position. On some morrow morning
The Duke departs; and now 'tis stir and bustle 60
Within his castles. He will hunt, and build,
Superintend his horses' pedigrees;
Creates himself a court, gives golden keys,
And introduceth strictest ceremony
In fine proportions, and nice etiquette; 65
Keeps open table with high cheer; in brief,
Commenceth mighty King&mdash;in miniature.
And while he prudently demeans himself,
And gives himself no actual importance,
He will be let appear whate'er he likes; 70
And who dares doubt, that Friedland will appear
A mighty Prince to his last dying hour?
Well now, what then? Duke Friedland is as others,
A fire-new Noble, whom the war hath raised
To price and currency, a Jonah's Gourd, 75
An over-night creation of court-favour,
Which with an undistinguishable ease
Makes Baron or makes Prince.

Wallenstein. Take her away.
Let in the young Count Piccolomini.

Countess. Art thou in earnest? I entreat thee! Canst thou 80
Consent to bear thyself to thy own grave,
So ignominiously to be dried up?
Thy life, that arrogated such a height
To end in such a nothing! To be nothing,
When one was always nothing, is an evil 85
That asks no stretch of patience, a light evil,
But to become a nothing, having been&mdash;&mdash;

Wallenstein (starts up). Shew me a way out of this stifling crowd,
Ye Powers of Aidance! Shew me such a way
As I am capable of going.&mdash;I 90
Am no tongue-hero, no fine virtue-prattler;
I cannot warm by thinking; cannot say
[701]
To the good luck that turns her back upon me,
Magnanimously: 'Go! I need thee not.'
Cease I to work, I am annihilated, 95
Dangers nor sacrifices will I shun,
If so I may avoid the last extreme;
But ere I sink down into nothingness,
Leave off so little, who began so great,
Ere that the world confuses me with those 100
Poor wretches, whom a day creates and crumbles,
This age and after-ages[701:1] speak my name
With hate and dread; and Friedland be redemption
For each accurs&eacute;d deed!

Countess. What is there here, then,
So against nature? Help me to perceive it! 105
O let not Superstition's nightly goblins
Subdue thy clear bright spirit! Art thou bid
To murder?&mdash;with abhorr'd accurs&eacute;d poniard,
To violate the breasts that nourished thee?
That were against our nature, that might aptly 110
Make thy flesh shudder, and thy whole heart sicken.[701:2]
Yet not a few, and for a meaner object,
Have ventured even this, ay, and performed it.
What is there in thy case so black and monstrous?
Thou art accused of treason&mdash;whether with 115
Or without justice is not now the question&mdash;
Thou art lost if thou dost not avail thee quickly
Of the power which thou possessest&mdash;Friedland! Duke!
Tell me, where lives that thing so meek and tame,
That doth not all his living faculties 120
Put forth in preservation of his life?
What deed so daring, which necessity
And desperation will not sanctify?

Wallenstein. Once was this Ferdinand so gracious to me:
[702]
He loved me; he esteemed me; I was placed 125
The nearest to his heart. Full many a time
We like familiar friends, both at one table,
Have banquetted together. He and I&mdash;
And the young kings themselves held me the bason
Wherewith to wash me&mdash;and is't come to this? 130

Countess. So faithfully preserv'st thou each small favour,
And hast no memory for contumelies?
Must I remind thee, how at Regenspurg
This man repaid thy faithful services?
All ranks and all conditions in the Empire 135
Thou hadst wronged, to make him great,&mdash;hadst loaded on thee,
On thee, the hate, the curse of the whole world.
No friend existed for thee in all Germany,
And why? because thou hadst existed only
For the Emperor. To the Emperor alone 140
Clung Friedland in that storm which gathered round him
At Regenspurg in the Diet&mdash;and he dropped thee!
He let thee fall! He let thee fall a victim
To the Bavarian, to that insolent!
Deposed, stript bare of all thy dignity 145
And power, amid the taunting of thy foes,
Thou wert let drop into obscurity.&mdash;
Say not, the restoration of thy honour
Hath made atonement for that first injustice.
No honest good-will was it that replaced thee, 150
The law of hard necessity replaced thee,
Which they had fain opposed, but that they could not.

Wallenstein. Not to their good wishes, that is certain,
Nor yet to his affection I'm indebted
For this high office; and if I abuse it, 155
I shall therein abuse no confidence.

Countess. Affection! confidence!&mdash;They needed thee.
Necessity, impetuous remonstrant!
Who not with empty names, or shews of proxy,
Is served, who'll have the thing and not the symbol, 160
Ever seeks out the greatest and the best,
And at the rudder places him, e'en though
She had been forced to take him from the rabble&mdash;
She, this Necessity, it was that placed thee
In this high office, it was she that gave thee 165
[703]
Thy letters patent of inauguration.
For, to the uttermost moment that they can.
This race still help themselves at cheapest rate
With slavish souls, with puppets! At the approach
Of extreme peril, when a hollow image 170
Is found a hollow image and no more,
Then falls the power into the mighty hands
Of Nature, of the spirit giant-born,
Who listens only to himself, knows nothing
Of stipulations, duties, reverences 175
And, like the emancipated force of fire,
Unmastered scorches, ere it reaches them,
Their fine-spun webs, their artificial policy.

Wallenstein. 'Tis true! they saw me always as I am&mdash;
Always! I did not cheat them in the bargain. 180
I never held it worth my pains to hide
The bold all-grasping habit of my soul.

Countess. Nay rather&mdash;thou hast ever shewn thyself
A formidable man, without restraint;
Hast exercised the full prerogatives 185
Of thy impetuous nature, which had been
Once granted to thee. Therefore, Duke, not thou,
Who hast still remained consistent with thyself,
But they are in the wrong, who fearing thee,
Entrusted such a power in hands they feared. 190
For, by the laws of Spirit, in the right
Is every individual character
That acts in strict consistence with itself.
Self-contradiction is the only wrong.
Wert thou another being, then, when thou 195
Eight years ago pursuedst thy march with fire
And sword, and desolation, through the Circles
Of Germany, the universal scourge,
Didst mock all ordinances of the empire,
The fearful rights of strength alone exertedst, 200
Trampledst to earth each rank, each magistracy,
All to extend thy Sultan's domination?
Then was the time to break thee in, to curb
Thy haughty will, to teach thee ordinance.
But no! the Emperor felt no touch of conscience, 205
What served him pleased him, and without a murmur
He stamped his broad seal on these lawless deeds.
[704]
What at that time was right, because thou didst it
For him, to-day is all at once become
Opprobrious, foul, because it is directed 210
Against him.&mdash;O most flimsy superstition!

Wallenstein (rising). I never saw it in this light before.
'Tis even so. The Emperor perpetrated
Deeds through my arm, deeds most unorderly.
And even this prince's mantle, which I wear, 215
I owe to what were services to him,
But most high misdemeanours 'gainst the empire.

Countess. Then betwixt thee and him (confess it, Friedland!)
The point can be no more of right and duty,
Only of power and opportunity. 220
That opportunity, lo! it comes yonder,
Approaching with swift steeds; then with a swing
Throw thyself up into the chariot-seat,
Seize with firm hand the reins, ere thy opponent
Anticipate thee, and himself make conquest 225
Of the now empty seat. The moment comes&mdash;
It is already here, when thou must write
The absolute total of thy life's vast sum.
The constellations stand victorious o'er thee,
The planets shoot good fortune in fair junctions, 230
And tell thee, 'Now's the time!' The starry courses
Hast thou thy life long measured to no purpose?
The quadrant and the circle, were they playthings?
[Pointing to the different objects in the room.
The zodiacs, the rolling orbs of heaven,
Hast pictured on these walls, and all around thee 235
In dumb, foreboding symbols hast thou placed
These seven presiding Lords of Destiny&mdash;
For toys? Is all this preparation nothing?
Is there no marrow in this hollow art,
That even to thyself it doth avail 240
Nothing, and has no influence over thee
In the great moment of decision?&mdash;&mdash;

Wallenstein (interrupting the Countess). Send Wrangel to me&mdash;I will instantly
Dispatch three couriers&mdash;&mdash;


[705]


Illo (hurrying out). God in heaven be praised!

Wallenstein. It is his evil genius and mine. 245
Our evil genius! It chastises him
Through me, the instrument of his ambition;
And I expect no less, than that Revenge
E'en now is whetting for my breast the poniard.
Who sows the serpent's teeth, let him not hope 250
To reap a joyous harvest. Every crime
Has, in the moment of its perpetration,
Its own avenging angel&mdash;dark misgiving,
An ominous sinking at the inmost heart.
He can no longer trust me&mdash;Then no longer 255
Can I retreat&mdash;so come that which must come.&mdash;
Still destiny preserves its due relations,
The heart within us is its absolute
Vicegerent. [To Tertsky.
Go, conduct you Gustave Wrangel
To my state-cabinet. Myself will speak to 260
The couriers.&mdash;And dispatch immediately
A servant for Octavio Piccolomini.  [To the Countess.
No exultation&mdash;woman, triumph not!
For jealous are the Powers of Destiny.
Joy premature, and shouts ere victory, 265
Incroach upon their rights and privileges.
We sow the seed, and they the growth determine.


[While he is making his exit the curtain drops.

ACT V

Scene I

Scene&mdash;As in the preceding Act.

Wallenstein, Octavio Piccolomini.


Wallenstein (coming forward in conversation). He sends me word from Linz, that he lies sick;
But I have sure intelligence, that he
Secretes himself at Frauenberg with Galas.
Secure them both, and send them to me hither.
Remember, thou tak'st on thee the command 5
[706]
Of those same Spanish regiments,&mdash;constantly
Make preparation, and be never ready;
And if they urge thee to draw out against me,
Still answer yes, and stand as thou wert fettered.
I know, that it is doing thee a service 10
To keep thee out of action in this business.
Thou lovest to linger on in fair appearances;
Steps of extremity are not thy province,
Therefore have I sought out this part for thee.
Thou wilt this time be of most service to me 15
By thy inertness. The mean time, if fortune
Declare itself on my side, thou wilt know
What is to do.


Enter Max Piccolomini.


Now go, Octavio.
This night must thou be off, take my own horses:
Him here I keep with me&mdash;make short farewell&mdash; 20
Trust me, I think we all shall meet again
In joy and thriving fortunes.

Octavio (to his son). I shall see you
Yet ere I go.




LINENOTES:

[3] Secretes] Secrets 1828, 1829, 1893.

[9] yes 1800, 1828, 1829.



Scene II

Wallenstein, Max Piccolomini.


Max (advances to him). My General!

Wallenstein. That am I no longer, if
Thou styl'st thyself the Emperor's officer.

Max. Then thou wilt leave the army, General?

Wallenstein. I have renounced the service of the Emperor.

Max. And thou wilt leave the army?

Wallenstein. Rather hope I 5
To bind it nearer still and faster to me.      [He seats himself.
Yes, Max, I have delayed to open it to thee,
Even till the hour of acting 'gins to strike.
Youth's fortunate feeling doth seize easily
The absolute right, yea, and a joy it is 10
To exercise the single apprehension
Where the sums square in proof;
But where it happens, that of two sure evils
One must be taken, where the heart not wholly
Brings itself back from out the strife of duties, 15
[707]
There 'tis a blessing to have no election,
And blank necessity is grace and favour.
&mdash;This is now present: do not look behind thee.&mdash;
It can no more avail thee. Look thou forwards!
Think not! judge not! prepare thyself to act! 20
The Court&mdash;it hath determined on my ruin,
Therefore I will to be beforehand with them.
We'll join the Swedes&mdash;right gallant fellows are they,
And our good friends.
[He stops himself, expecting Piccolomini's answer.
I have ta'en thee by surprise. Answer me not. 25
I grant thee time to recollect thyself.


[He rises, and retires at the back of the stage. Max remains for a long
time motionless, in a trance of excessive anguish. At his first motion
Wallenstein returns, and places himself before him.


Max. My General, this day thou makest me
Of age to speak in my own right and person,
For till this day I have been spared the trouble
To find out my own road. Thee have I followed 30
With most implicit unconditional faith,
Sure of the right path if I followed thee.
To-day, for the first time, dost thou refer
Me to myself, and forcest me to make
Election between thee and my own heart. 35

Wallenstein. Soft cradled thee thy Fortune till to-day;
Thy duties thou couldst exercise in sport,
Indulge all lovely instincts, act for ever
With undivided heart. It can remain
No longer thus. Like enemies, the roads 40
Start from each other. Duties strive with duties.
Thou must needs choose thy party in the war
Which is now kindling 'twixt thy friend and him
Who is thy Emperor.

Max. War! is that the name?
War is as frightful as heaven's pestilence. 45
Yet it is good, is it heaven's will as that is.
Is that a good war, which against the Emperor
Thou wagest with the Emperor's own army?
O God of heaven! what a change is this.
Beseems it me to offer such persuasion 50
To thee, who like the fixed star of the pole
Wert all I gazed at on life's trackless ocean?
[708]
O! what a rent thou makest in my heart!
The ingrained instinct of old reverence.
The holy habit of obediency, 55
Must I pluck live asunder from thy name?
Nay, do not turn thy countenance upon me&mdash;
It always was as a god looking at me!
Duke Wallenstein, its power is not departed:
The senses still are in thy bonds, although, 60
Bleeding, the soul hath freed itself.

Wallenstein. Max, hear me.

Max. O! do it not, I pray thee, do it not!
There is a pure and noble soul within thee,
Knows not of this unblest, unlucky doing.
Thy will is chaste, it is thy fancy only 65
Which hath polluted thee&mdash;and innocence,
It will not let itself be driven away
From that world-awing aspect. Thou wilt not,
Thou canst not, end in this. It would reduce
All human creatures to disloyalty 70
Against the nobleness of their own nature.
'Twill justify the vulgar misbelief,
Which holdeth nothing noble in free will,
And trusts itself to impotence alone
Made powerful only in an unknown power. 75

Wallenstein. The world will judge me sternly, I expect it.
Already have I said to my own self
All thou canst say to me. Who but avoids
The extreme,&mdash;can he by going round avoid it?
But here there is no choice. Yes&mdash;I must use 80
Or suffer violence&mdash;so stands the case,
There remains nothing possible but that.

Max. O that is never possible for thee!
'Tis the last desperate resource of those
Cheap souls, to whom their honour, their good name 85
Is their poor saving, their last worthless keep,
Which having staked and lost, they stake themselves
In the mad rage of gaming. Thou art rich,
And glorious; with an unpolluted heart
Thou canst make conquest of whate'er seems highest! 90
But he, who once hath acted infamy,
Does nothing more in this world.

Wallenstein (grasps his hand). Calmly, Max!
[709]
Much that is great and excellent will we
Perform together yet. And if we only
Stand on the height with dignity, 'tis soon 95
Forgotten, Max, by what road we ascended.
Believe me, many a crown shines spotless now,
That yet was deeply sullied in the winning.
To the evil spirit doth the earth belong,
Not to the good. All, that the powers divine 100
Send from above, are universal blessings:
Their light rejoices us, their air refreshes,
But never yet was man enriched by them:
In their eternal realm no property
Is to be struggled for&mdash;all there is general. 105
The jewel, the all-valued gold we win
From the deceiving Powers, depraved in nature,
That dwell beneath the day and blessed sun-light.
Not without sacrifices are they rendered
Propitious, and there lives no soul on earth 110
That e'er retired unsullied from their service.

Max. Whate'er is human, to the human being
Do I allow&mdash;and to the vehement
And striving spirit readily I pardon
The excess of action; but to thee, my General! 115
Above all others make I large concession.
For thou must move a world, and be the master&mdash;
He kills thee, who condemns thee to inaction.
So be it then! maintain thee in thy post
By violence. Resist the Emperor, 120
And if it must be, force with force repel:
I will not praise it, yet I can forgive it.
But not&mdash;not to the traitor&mdash;yes!&mdash;the word
Is spoken out&mdash;&mdash;
Not to the traitor can I yield a pardon. 125
That is no mere excess! that is no error
Of human nature&mdash;that is wholly different,
O that is black, black as the pit of hell!
Thou canst not hear it nam'd, and wilt thou do it?
O turn back to thy duty. That thou canst, 130
I hold it certain. Send me to Vienna.
I'll make thy peace for thee with the Emperor.
[710]
He knows thee not. But I do know thee. He
Shall see thee, Duke! with my unclouded eye,
And I bring back his confidence to thee. 135

Wallenstein. It is too late. Thou knowest not what has happened.

Max. Were it too late, and were things gone so far,
That a crime only could prevent thy fall,
Then&mdash;fall! fall honourably, even as thou stood'st.
Lose the command. Go from the stage of war. 140
Thou canst with splendour do it&mdash;do it too
With innocence. Thou hast liv'd much for others,
At length live thou for thy own self. I follow thee.
My destiny I never part from thine.

Wallenstein. It is too late! Even now, while thou art losing 145
Thy words, one after the other are the mile-stones
Left fast behind by my post couriers,
Who bear the order on to Prague and Egra.
Yield thyself to it. We act as we are forced.
I cannot give assent to my own shame 150
And ruin. Thou&mdash;no&mdash;thou canst not forsake me!
So let us do, what must be done, with dignity,
With a firm step. What am I doing worse
Than did famed C&aelig;sar at the Rubicon,
When he the legions led against his country, 155
The which his country had delivered to him?
Had he thrown down the sword, he had been lost,
As I were, if I but disarmed myself.
I trace out something in me of his spirit.
Give me his luck, that other thing I'll bear. 160


[Max quits him abruptly. Wallenstein, startled and overpowered,
continues looking after him, and is still in this posture when Tertsky
enters.

Scene III

Wallenstein, Tertsky.


Tertsky. Max Piccolomini just left you?

Wallenstein. Where is Wrangel?

Tertsky. He is already gone.


[711]


Wallenstein. In such a hurry?

Tertsky. It is as if the earth had swallowed him.
He had scarce left thee, when I went to seek him.
I wished some words with him&mdash;but he was gone. 5
How, when, and where, could no one tell me. Nay,
I half believe it was the devil himself;
A human creature could not so at once
Have vanished.

Illo (enters). Is it true that thou wilt send
Octavio?

Tertsky. How, Octavio! Whither send him? 10

Wallenstein. He goes to Frauenberg, and will lead hither
The Spanish and Italian regiments.

Illo. No!
Nay, Heaven forbid!

Wallenstein. And why should Heaven forbid?

Illo. Him!&mdash;that deceiver! Would'st thou trust to him
The soldiery? Him wilt thou let slip from thee, 15
Now, in the very instant that decides us&mdash;&mdash;

Tertsky. Thou wilt not do this!&mdash;No! I pray thee, no!

Wallenstein. Ye are whimsical.

Illo. O but for this time, Duke,
Yield to our warning! Let him not depart.

Wallenstein. And why should I not trust him only this time, 20
Who have always trusted him? What, then, has happened,
That I should lose my good opinion of him?
In complaisance to your whims, not my own,
I must, forsooth, give up a rooted judgment.
Think not I am a woman. Having trusted him 25
E'en till to-day, to-day too will I trust him.

Tertsky. Must it be he&mdash;he only? Send another.

Wallenstein. It must be he, whom I myself have chosen;
He is well fitted for the business. Therefore
I gave it him.

Illo. Because he's an Italian&mdash; 30
Therefore is he well fitted for the business.

Wallenstein. I know you love them not&mdash;nor sire nor son&mdash;
Because that I esteem them, love them&mdash;visibly
Esteem them, love them more than you and others,
E'en as they merit. Therefore are they eye-blights, 35
Thorns in your foot-path. But your jealousies,
In what affect they me or my concerns?
[712]
Are they the worse to me because you hate them?
Love or hate one another as you will,
I leave to each man his own moods and likings; 40
Yet know the worth of each of you to me.

Illo. Von Questenberg, while he was here, was always
Lurking about with this Octavio.

Wallenstein. It happened with my knowledge and permission.

Illo. I know that secret messengers came to him 45
From Galas&mdash;&mdash;

Wallenstein. That's not true.

Illo. O thou art blind
With thy deep-seeing eyes.

Wallenstein. Thou wilt not shake
My faith for me&mdash;my faith, which founds itself
On the profoundest science. If 'tis false,
Then the whole science of the stars is false. 50
For know, I have a pledge from fate itself,
That he is the most faithful of my friends.

Illo. Hast thou a pledge, that this pledge is not false?

Wallenstein. There exist moments in the life of man,
When he is nearer the great soul of the world 55
Than is man's custom, and possesses freely
The power of questioning his destiny:
And such a moment 'twas, when in the night
Before the action in the plains of L&uuml;tzen,
Leaning against a tree, thoughts crowding thoughts, 60
I looked out far upon the ominous plain.
My whole life, past and future, in this moment
Before my mind's eye glided in procession,
And to the destiny of the next morning
The spirit, filled with anxious presentiment, 65
Did knit the most removed futurity.
Then said I also to myself, 'So many
Dost thou command. They follow all thy stars,
And as on some great number set their All
Upon thy single head, and only man 70
The vessel of thy fortune. Yet a day
Will come, when destiny shall once more scatter
All these in many a several direction:
Few be they who will stand out faithful to thee.'
I yearn'd to know which one was faithfullest 75
[713]
Of all, this camp included. Great Destiny,
Give me a sign! And he shall be the man,
Who, on the approaching morning, comes the first
To meet me with a token of his love:
And thinking this, I fell into a slumber. 80
Then midmost in the battle was I led
In spirit. Great the pressure and the tumult!
Then was my horse killed under me: I sank:
And over me away, all unconcernedly,
Drove horse and rider&mdash;and thus trod to pieces 85
I lay, and panted like a dying man.
Then seized me suddenly a saviour arm;
It was Octavio's&mdash;I awoke at once,
'Twas broad day, and Octavio stood before me.
'My brother,' said he,'do not ride to-day 90
The dapple, as you're wont; but mount the horse
Which I have chosen for thee. Do it, brother!
In love to me. A strong dream warned me so.'
It was the swiftness of this horse that snatched me
From the hot pursuit of Bannier's dragoons. 95
My cousin rode the dapple on that day.
And never more saw I or horse or rider.

Illo. That was a chance.

Wallenstein. There's no such thing as chance.
In brief, 'tis signed and sealed that this Octavio
Is my good angel&mdash;and now no word more.
[He is retiring.

Tertsky. This is my comfort&mdash;Max remains our hostage. 100

Illo. And he shall never stir from here alive.

Wallenstein (stops and turns himself round). Are ye not like the women, who for ever
Only recur to their first word, although
One had been talking reason by the hour? 105
Know, that the human being's thoughts and deeds
Are not, like ocean billows, blindly moved.
The inner world, his microcosmus, is
The deep shaft, out of which they spring eternally.
They grow by certain laws, like the tree's fruit&mdash; 110
No juggling chance can metamorphose them.
Have I the human kernel first examined?
Then I know, too, the future will and action.

Scene IV

Scene&mdash;A Chamber in Piccolomini's Dwelling-House.

Octavio Piccolomini, Isolani (entering).


Isolani. Here am I&mdash;Well! who comes yet of the others?

Octavio. But, first, a word with you, Count Isolani.

Isolani. Will it explode, ha?&mdash;Is the Duke about
To make the attempt? In me, friend, you may place
Full confidence.&mdash;Nay, put me to the proof. 5

Octavio. That may happen.

Isolani. Noble brother, I am
Not one of those men who in words are valiant,
And when it comes to action skulk away.
The Duke has acted towards me as a friend.
God knows it is so; and I owe him all&mdash;&mdash; 10
He may rely on my fidelity.

Octavio. That will be seen hereafter.

Isolani. Be on your guard,
All think not as I think; and there are many
Who still hold with the Court&mdash;yes, and they say
That those stolen signatures bind them to nothing. 15

Octavio. I am rejoiced to hear it.

Isolani. You rejoice!

Octavio. That the Emperor has yet such gallant servants
And loving friends.

Isolani. Nay, jeer not, I entreat you.
They are no such worthless fellows, I assure you.

Octavio. I am assured already. God forbid 20
That I should jest!&mdash;In very serious earnest
I am rejoiced to see an honest cause
So strong.

Isolani. The Devil!&mdash;what!&mdash;why, what means this?
Are you not, then&mdash;&mdash;For what, then, am I here?

Octavio. That you may make full declaration, whether 25
You will be called the friend or enemy
Of the Emperor.

Isolani. That declaration, friend,
I'll make to him in whom a right is placed
To put that question to me.

Octavio. Whether, Count, 30
That right is mine, this paper may instruct you.


[715]


Isolani. Why,&mdash;why&mdash;what! This is the Emperor's hand and seal! [Reads.
'Whereas the officers collectively
Throughout our army will obey the orders
Of the Lieutenant-General Piccolomini 35
As from ourselves.'&mdash;&mdash;Hem!&mdash;Yes! so!&mdash;Yes! yes!&mdash;
I&mdash;I give you joy, Lieutenant-General!

Octavio. And you submit you to the order?

Isolani. I&mdash;&mdash;
But you have taken me so by surprise&mdash;
Time for reflection one must have&mdash;&mdash;

Octavio. Two minutes. 40

Isolani. My God! But then the case is&mdash;&mdash;

Octavio. Plain and simple.
You must declare you, whether you determine
To act a treason 'gainst your Lord and Sovereign,
Or whether you will serve him faithfully.

Isolani. Treason!&mdash;My God!&mdash;But who talks then of treason? 45

Octavio. That is the case. The Prince-Duke is a traitor&mdash;
Means to lead over to the enemy
The Emperor's army.&mdash;Now, Count!&mdash;brief and full&mdash;
Say, will you break your oath to the Emperor?
Sell yourself to the enemy?&mdash;Say, will you? 50

Isolani. What mean you? I&mdash;I break my oath, d'ye say,
To his Imperial Majesty?
Did I say so?&mdash;When, when have I said that?

Octavio. You have not said it yet&mdash;not yet. This instant
I wait to hear, Count, whether you will say it. 55

Isolani. Aye! that delights me now, that you yourself
Bear witness for me that I never said so.

Octavio. And you renounce the Duke then?

Isolani. If he's planning
Treason&mdash;why, treason breaks all bonds asunder.

Octavio. And are determined, too, to fight against him? 60

Isolani. He has done me service&mdash;but if he's a villain,
Perdition seize him!&mdash;All scores are rubbed off.

Octavio. I am rejoiced that you're so well disposed.
This night break off in the utmost secrecy
With all the light-armed troops&mdash;it must appear 65
As came the order from the Duke himself.
[716]
At Frauenberg's the place of rendezvous;
There will Count Galas give you further orders.

Isolani. It shall be done. But you'll remember me
With the Emperor&mdash;how well disposed you found me. 70

Octavio. I will not fail to mention it honourably.

[Exit Isolani. A Servant enters.

What, Colonel Butler!&mdash;Shew him up.

Isolani (returning). Forgive me too my bearish ways, old father!
Lord God! how should I know, then, what a great
Person I had before me.

Octavio. No excuses! 75

Isolani. I am a merry lad, and if at time
A rash word might escape me 'gainst the court
Amidst my wine&mdash;You know no harm was meant. [Exit.

Octavio. You need not be uneasy on that score.
That has succeeded. Fortune favour us 80
With all the others only but as much!

Scene V

Octavio Piccolomini, Butler.


Butler. At your command, Lieutenant-General.

Octavio. Welcome, as honoured friend and visitor.

Butler. You do me too much honour.

Octavio (after both have seated themselves). You have not
Returned the advances which I made you yesterday&mdash;
Misunderstood them, as mere empty forms. 5
That wish proceeded from my heart&mdash;I was
In earnest with you&mdash;for 'tis now a time
In which the honest should unite most closely.

Butler. 'Tis only the like-minded can unite.

Octavio. True! and I name all honest men like-minded. 10
I never charge a man but with those acts
To which his character deliberately
Impels him; for alas! the violence
Of blind misunderstandings often thrusts
The very best of us from the right track. 15
You came through Frauenberg. Did the Count Galas
Say nothing to you? Tell me. He's my friend.

Butler. His words were lost on me.

Octavio. It grieves me sorely
[717]
To hear it: for his counsel was most wise.
I had myself the like to offer.

Butler. Spare 20
Yourself the trouble&mdash;me th' embarrassment,
To have deserved so ill your good opinion.

Octavio. The time is precious&mdash;let us talk openly.
You know how matters stand here. Wallenstein
Meditates treason&mdash;I can tell you further&mdash; 25
He has committed treason; but few hours
Have past, since he a covenant concluded
With the enemy. The messengers are now
Full on their way to Egra and to Prague.
To-morrow he intends to lead us over 30
To the enemy. But he deceives himself;
For prudence wakes&mdash;the Emperor has still
Many and faithful friends here, and they stand
In closest union, mighty though unseen.
This manifesto sentences the Duke&mdash; 35
Recalls the obedience of the army from him,
And summons all the loyal, all the honest,
To join and recognize in me their leader.
Choose&mdash;will you share with us an honest cause?
Or with the evil share an evil lot? 40

Butler (rises). His lot is mine.

Octavio. Is that your last resolve?

Butler. It is.

Octavio. Nay, but bethink you, Colonel Butler!
As yet you have time. Within my faithful breast
That rashly uttered word remains interred.
Recall it, Butler! choose a better party: 45
You have not chosen the right one.

Butler (going). Any other
Commands for me, Lieutenant-General?

Octavio. See your white hairs! Recall that word!

Butler. Farewell!

Octavio. What, would you draw this good and gallant sword
In such a cause? Into a curse would you 50
Transform the gratitude which you have earned
By forty years' fidelity from Austria?

Butler (laughing with bitterness). Gratitude from the House of Austria. [He is going.

Octavio (permits him to go as far as the door, then calls after him).
Butler!


[718]


Butler. What wish you?

Octavio. How was't with the Count?

Butler. Count? what?

Octavio. The title that you wished, I mean. 55

Butler (starts in sudden passion). Hell and damnation!

Octavio. You petitioned for it&mdash;
And your petition was repelled&mdash;Was it so?

Butler. Your insolent scoff shall not go by unpunished.
Draw!

Octavio. Nay! your sword to 'ts sheath![718:1] and tell me calmly,
How all that happened. I will not refuse you 60
Your satisfaction afterwards.&mdash;Calmly, Butler!

Butler. Be the whole world acquainted with the weakness
For which I never can forgive myself.
Lieutenant-General! Yes&mdash;I have ambition.
Ne'er was I able to endure contempt. 65
It stung me to the quick, that birth and title
Should have more weight than merit has in the army.
I would fain not be meaner than my equal,
So in an evil hour I let myself
Be tempted to that measure&mdash;It was folly! 70
But yet so hard a penance it deserved not.
It might have been refused; but wherefore barb
And venom the refusal with contempt?
Why dash to earth and crush with heaviest scorn
The grey-haired man, the faithful veteran? 75
Why to the baseness of his parentage
Refer him with such cruel roughness, only
Because he had a weak hour and forgot himself?
But nature gives a sting e'en to the worm
Which wanton power treads on in sport and insult. 80

Octavio. You must have been calumniated. Guess you
The enemy, who did you this ill service?

Butler. Be't who it will&mdash;a most low-hearted scoundrel,
Some vile court-minion must it be, some Spaniard,
Some young squire of some ancient family, 85
In whose light I may stand, some envious knave,
Stung to his soul by my fair self-earned honours!


[719]


Octavio. But tell me! Did the Duke approve that measure?

Butler. Himself impelled me to it, used his interest
In my behalf with all the warmth of friendship. 90

Octavio. Ay? Are you sure of that?

Butler. I read the letter.

Octavio. And so did I&mdash;but the contents were different.
By chance I'm in possession of that letter&mdash;
Can leave it to your own eyes to convince you.
[He gives him the letter.

Butler. Ha! what is this?

Octavio. I fear me, Colonel Butler, 95
An infamous game have they been playing with you.
The Duke, you say, impelled you to this measure?
Now, in this letter talks he in contempt
Concerning you, counsels the Minister
To give sound chastisement to your conceit, 100
For so he calls it.

[Butler reads through the letter, his knees tremble, he seizes a chair,
and sinks down in it.

You have no enemy, no persecutor;
There's no one wishes ill to you. Ascribe
The insult you received to the Duke only.
His aim is clear and palpable. He wished 105
To tear you from your Emperor&mdash;he hoped
To gain from your revenge what he well knew
(What your long-tried fidelity convinced him)
He ne'er could dare expect from your calm reason.
A blind tool would he make you, in contempt 110
Use you, as means of most abandoned ends.
He has gained his point. Too well has he succeeded
In luring you away from that good path
On which you had been journeying forty years!

Butler. Can e'er the Emperor's Majesty forgive me? 115

Octavio. More than forgive you. He would fain compensate
For that affront, and most unmerited grievance
Sustained by a deserving, gallant veteran.
From his free impulse he confirms the present,
Which the Duke made you for a wicked purpose. 120
The regiment, which you now command, is yours.


[Butler attempts to rise, sinks down again. He labours inwardly with
violent emotions; tries to speak, and [720]cannot. At length he takes his
sword from the belt, and offers it to Piccolomini.


Octavio. What wish you? Recollect yourself, friend.

Butler. Take it.

Octavio. But to what purpose? Calm yourself.

Butler. O take it!
I am no longer worthy of this sword.

Octavio. Receive it then anew from my hands&mdash;and 125
Wear it with honour for the right cause ever.

Butler.&mdash;&mdash;Perjure myself to such a gracious Sovereign!

Octavio. You'll make amends. Quick! break off from the Duke!

Butler. Break off from him!

Octavio. What now? Bethink thyself.

Butler (no longer governing his emotion). Only break off from him?&mdash;He dies!&mdash;he dies! 130

Octavio. Come after me to Frauenberg, where now
All who are loyal are assembling under
Counts Altringer and Galas. Many others
I've brought to a remembrance of their duty.
This night be sure that you escape from Pilsen. 135

Butler. Count Piccolomini! Dare that man speak
Of honour to you, who once broke his troth?

Octavio. He, who repents so deeply of it, dares.

Butler. Then leave me here, upon my word of honour!

Octavio. What's your design?

Butler. Leave me and my regiment. 140

Octavio. I have full confidence in you. But tell me
What are you brooding?

Butler. That the deed will tell you.
Ask me no more at present. Trust to me.
Ye may trust safely. By the living God
Ye give him over, not to his good angel! 145
Farewell. [Exit Butler.

Servant (enters with a billet). A stranger left it, and is gone.
The Prince-Duke's horses wait for you below. [Exit Servant.

Octavio (reads). 'Be sure, make haste! Your faithful Isolan.'
&mdash;O that I had but left this town behind me.
To split upon a rock so near the haven!&mdash; 150
Away! This is no longer a safe place for me!
Where can my son be tarrying?

Scene VI

Octavio and Max Piccolomini.


Octavio (advances to Max). I am going off, my son.
[Receiving no answer he takes his hand.
My son, farewell.

Max. Farewell.

Octavio. Thou wilt soon follow me?

Max. I follow thee?
Thy way is crooked&mdash;it is not my way.
[Octavio drops his hand, and starts back.
O, hadst thou been but simple and sincere,
Ne'er had it come to this&mdash;all had stood otherwise. 5
He had not done that foul and horrible deed,
The virtuous had retained their influence o'er him:
He had not fallen into the snares of villains.
Wherefore so like a thief, and thief's accomplice
Did'st creep behind him&mdash;lurking for thy prey? 10
O, unblest falsehood! Mother of all evil!
Thou misery-making demon, it is thou
That sink'st us in perdition. Simple truth,
Sustainer of the world, had saved us all!
Father, I will not, I cannot excuse thee! 15
Wallenstein has deceived me&mdash;O, most foully!
But thou hast acted not much better.

Octavio. Son!
My son, ah! I forgive thy agony!

Max. Was't possible? had'st thou the heart, my father,
Had'st thou the heart to drive it to such lengths, 20
With cold premeditated purpose? Thou&mdash;
Had'st thou the heart, to wish to see him guilty,
Rather than saved? Thou risest by his fall.
Octavio, 'twill not please me.

Octavio. God in Heaven!

Max. O, woe is me! sure I have changed my nature. 25
[722]
How comes suspicion here&mdash;in the free soul?
Hope, confidence, belief, are gone; for all
Lied to me, all what I e'er loved or honoured.
No! No! Not all! She&mdash;she yet lives for me,
And she is true, and open as the Heavens! 30
Deceit is every where, hypocrisy,
Murder, and poisoning, treason, perjury:
The single holy spot is now our love,
The only unprofaned in human nature.

Octavio. Max!&mdash;we will go together. 'Twill be better. 35

Max. What? ere I've taken a last parting leave,
The very last&mdash;no never!

Octavio. Spare thyself
The pang of necessary separation.
Come with me! Come, my son!
[Attempts to take him with him.

Max. No! as sure as God lives, no! 40

Octavio. Come with me, I command thee! I, thy father.

Max. Command me what is human. I stay here.

Octavio. Max! in the Emperor's name I bid thee come.

Max. No Emperor has power to prescribe
Laws to the heart; and would'st thou wish to rob me 45
Of the sole blessing which my fate has left me,
Her sympathy? Must then a cruel deed
Be done with cruelty? The unalterable
Shall I perform ignobly&mdash;steal away,
With stealthy coward flight forsake her? No! 50
She shall behold my suffering, my sore anguish,
Hear the complaints of the disparted soul,
And weep tears o'er me. Oh! the human race
Have steely souls&mdash;but she is as an angel.
From the black deadly madness of despair 55
Will she redeem my soul, and in soft words
Of comfort, plaining, loose this pang of death!

Octavio. Thou wilt not tear thyself away; thou canst not.
O, come, my son! I bid thee save thy virtue.

Max. Squander not thou thy words in vain. 60
The heart I follow, for I dare trust to it.

Octavio. Max! Max! if that most damn&eacute;d thing could be,
If thou&mdash;my son&mdash;my own blood&mdash;(dare I think it?)
[723]
Do sell thyself to him, the infamous,
Do stamp this brand upon our noble house, 65
Then shall the world behold the horrible deed,
And in unnatural combat shall the steel
Of the son trickle with the father's blood.

Max. O hadst thou always better thought of men,
Thou hadst then acted better. Curst suspicion! 70
Unholy miserable doubt! To him
Nothing on earth remains unwrenched and firm,
Who has no faith.

Octavio. And if I trust thy heart,
Will it be always in thy power to follow it?

Max. The heart's voice thou hast not o'erpower'd&mdash;as little 75
Will Wallenstein be able to o'erpower it.

Octavio. O, Max! I see thee never more again!

Max. Unworthy of thee wilt thou never see me.

Octavio. I go to Frauenberg&mdash;the Pappenheimers
I leave thee here, the Lothrings too; Toskana 80
And Tiefenbach remain here to protect thee.
They love thee, and are faithful to their oath,
And will far rather fall in gallant contest
Than leave their rightful leader, and their honour.

Max. Rely on this, I either leave my life 85
In the struggle, or conduct them out of Pilsen.

Octavio. Farewell, my son!

Max. Farewell!

Octavio. How? not one look
Of filial love? No grasp of the hand at parting?
It is a bloody war, to which we are going,
And the event uncertain and in darkness. 90
So used we not to part&mdash;it was not so!
Is it then true? I have a son no longer?


[Max falls into his arms, they hold each [other] for a long time in a
speechless embrace, then go away at different sides.

The Curtain drops.

[724]
THE DEATH OF WALLENSTEIN

&nbsp;
A TRAGEDY
IN FIVE ACTS



PREFACE OF THE TRANSLATOR
TO THE FIRST EDITION


The two Dramas, Piccolomini, or the first part of
Wallenstein, and Wallenstein, are introduced in the original
manuscript by a Prelude in one Act, entitled Wallenstein's
Camp. This is written in rhyme, and in nine-syllable verse, in
the same lilting metre (if that expression may be permitted) 5
with the second Eclogue of Spenser's Shepherd's Calendar.

This Prelude possesses a sort of broad humour, and is not
deficient in character; but to have translated it into prose, or
into any other metre than that of the original, would have
given a false notion both of its style and purport; to have 10
translated it into the same metre would have been incompatible with
a faithful adherence to the sense of the German, from the
comparative poverty of our language in rhymes; and it would have
been unadvisable from the incongruity of those lax verses with
the present taste of the English Public. Schiller's intention 15
seems to have been merely to have prepared his reader for the
Tragedies by a lively picture of the laxity of discipline, and the
mutinous dispositions of Wallenstein's soldiery. It is not
necessary as a preliminary explanation. For these reasons it
has been thought expedient not to translate it. 20

The admirers of Schiller, who have abstracted their conception
of that author from the Robbers, and the Cabal and Love, plays
in which the main interest is produced by the excitement of
curiosity, and in which the curiosity is excited by terrible and
extraordinary incident, will not have perused without some 25
portion of disappointment the Dramas, which it has been my
employment to translate. They should, however, reflect that
these are Historical Dramas, taken from a popular German
History; that we must therefore judge of them in some measure
with the feelings of Germans; or by analogy, with the interest 30
excited in us by similar Dramas in our own language. Few,
I trust, would be rash or ignorant enough to compare Schiller
with Shakspeare yet, merely as illustration, I would say
[725]that we should proceed to the perusal of Wallenstein, not
from Lear or Othello, but from Richard the Second, or the 35
three parts of Henry the Sixth. We scarcely expect rapidity
in an Historical Drama; and many prolix speeches are
pardoned from characters, whose names and actions have
formed the most amusing tales of our early life. On the other
hand, there exist in these plays more individual beauties, 40
more passages the excellence of which will bear reflection,
than in the former productions of Schiller. The description of
the Astrological Tower, and the reflections of the Young Lover,
which follow it, form in the original a fine poem; and my
translation must have been wretched indeed, if it can have 45
wholly overclouded the beauties of the Scene in the first Act of
the first Play between Questenberg, Max, and Octavio Piccolomini.
If we except the Scene of the setting sun in the Robbers,
I know of no part in Schiller's Plays which equals the whole
of the first Scene of the fifth Act of the concluding Play. It 50
would be unbecoming in me to be more diffuse on this subject.
A Translator stands connected with the original Author by
a certain law of subordination, which makes it more decorous
to point out excellencies than defects: indeed he is not likely
to be a fair judge of either. The pleasure or disgust from his 55
own labour will mingle with the feelings that arise from an
afterview of the original. Even in the first perusal of a work
in any foreign language which we understand, we are apt to
attribute to it more excellence than it really possesses from our
own pleasurable sense of difficulty overcome without effect. 60
Translation of poetry into poetry is difficult, because the
Translator must give a brilliancy to his language without that warmth
of original conception, from which such brilliancy would follow
of its own accord. But the translator of a living Author is
encumbered with additional inconveniences. If he render his 65
original faithfully, as to the sense of each passage, he must
necessarily destroy a considerable portion of the spirit; if he
endeavour to give a work executed according to laws of
compensation, he subjects himself to imputations of vanity, or
misrepresentation. I have thought it my duty to remain 70
bound by the sense of my original, with as few exceptions as
the nature of the languages rendered possible.

THE DEATH OF WALLENSTEIN



ACT I

Scene I

Scene&mdash;A Chamber in the House of the Duchess of Friedland.

Countess Tertsky, Thekla, Lady Neubrunn (the two latter sit at the same
table at work).


Countess (watching them from the opposite side). So you have nothing, niece, to ask me? Nothing?
I have been waiting for a word from you.
And could you then endure in all this time
Not once to speak his name?
[The Countess rises and advances to her.
Why, how comes this?
Perhaps I am already grown superfluous, 5
And other ways exist, besides through me?
Confess it to me, Thekla! have you seen him?

Thekla. To-day and yesterday I have not seen him.

Countess. And not heard from him either? Come, be open!

Thekla. No syllable.


[727]


Countess. And still you are so calm? 10

Thekla. I am.

Countess. May't please you, leave us, Lady Neubrunn!
[Exit Lady Neubrunn.

Scene II

The Countess, Thekla.


Countess. It does not please me, Princess! that he holds
Himself so still, exactly at this time.

Thekla. Exactly at this time?

Countess. He now knows all.
'Twere now the moment to declare himself.

Thekla. If I'm to understand you, speak less darkly. 5

Countess. 'Twas for that purpose that I bade her leave us.
Thekla, you are no more a child. Your heart
Is now no more in nonage: for you love,
And boldness dwells with love&mdash;that you have proved.
Your nature moulds itself upon your father's 10
More than your mother's spirit. Therefore may you
Hear, what were too much for her fortitude.

Thekla. Enough! no further preface, I entreat you.
At once, out with it! Be it what it may,
It is not possible that it should torture me 15
More than this introduction. What have you
To say to me? Tell me the whole and briefly!

Countess. You'll not be frightened&mdash;

Thekla. Name it, I entreat you.

Countess. It lies within your power to do your father
A weighty service&mdash;

Thekla. Lies within my power? 20

Countess. Max Piccolomini loves you. You can link him
Indissolubly to your father.

Thekla. I?
What need of me for that? And is he not
Already linked to him?

Countess. He was.

Thekla. And wherefore
Should he not be so now&mdash;not be so always? 25

Countess. He cleaves to the Emperor too.

Thekla. Not more than duty
And honour may demand of him.

Countess. We ask
Proofs of his love, and not proofs of his honour.
[728]
Duty and honour!
Those are ambiguous words with many meanings. 30
You should interpret them for him: his love
Should be the sole definer of his honour.

Thekla. How?

Countess. The Emperor or you must he renounce.

Thekla. He will accompany my father gladly
In his retirement. From himself you heard, 35
How much he wished to lay aside the sword.

Countess. He must not lay the sword aside, we mean;
He must unsheath it in your father's cause.

Thekla. He'll spend with gladness and alacrity
His life, his heart's blood in my father's cause, 40
If shame or injury be intended him.

Countess. You will not understand me. Well, hear then!
Your father has fallen off from the Emperor,
And is about to join the enemy
With the whole soldiery&mdash;

Thekla. Alas, my mother! 45

Countess. There needs a great example to draw on
The army after him. The Piccolomini
Possess the love and reverence of the troops;
They govern all opinions, and wherever
They lead the way, none hesitate to follow. 50
The son secures the father to our interests&mdash;
You've much in your hands at this moment.

Thekla. Ah,
My miserable mother! what a death-stroke
Awaits thee!&mdash;No! She never will survive it.

Countess. She will accommodate her soul to that 55
Which is and must be. I do know your mother.
The far-off future weights upon her heart
With torture of anxiety; but is it
Unalterably, actually present,
She soon resigns herself, and bears it calmly. 60

Thekla. O my fore-boding bosom! Even now,
E'en now 'tis here, that icy hand of horror!
And my young hope lies shuddering in its grasp;
I knew it well&mdash;no sooner had I entered,
A heavy ominous presentiment 65
Revealed to me, that spirits of death were hovering
Over my happy fortune. But why think I
First of myself? My mother! O my mother!


[729]


Countess. Calm yourself! Break not out in vain lamenting!
Preserve you for your father the firm friend, 70
And for yourself the lover, all will yet
Prove good and fortunate.

Thekla. Prove good? What good?
Must we not part? Part ne'er to meet again?

Countess. He parts not from you! He can not part from you.

Thekla. Alas for his sore anguish! It will rend 75
His heart asunder.

Countess. If indeed he loves you,
His resolution will be speedily taken.

Thekla. His resolution will be speedily taken&mdash;
O do not doubt of that! A resolution!
Does there remain one to be taken?

Countess. Hush! 80
Collect yourself! I hear your mother coming.

Thekla. How shall I bear to see her?

Countess. Collect yourself.

Scene III

To them enter the Duchess.


Duchess (to the Countess). Who was here, sister? I heard some one talking,
And passionately too.

Countess. Nay! There was no one.

Duchess. I am grown so timorous, every trifling noise
Scatters my spirits, and announces to me
The footstep of some messenger of evil. 5
And can you tell me, sister, what the event is?
Will he agree to do the Emperor's pleasure,
And send the horse-regiments to the Cardinal?
Tell me, has he dismissed Von Questenberg
With a favourable answer?

Countess. No, he has not. 10

Duchess. Alas! then all is lost! I see it coming,
The worst that can come! Yes, they will depose him;
The accurs&eacute;d business of the Regenspurg diet
Will all be acted o'er again!

Countess. No! never!
Make your heart easy, sister, as to that. 15


[Thekla throws herself upon her mother, and enfolds her in her arms,
weeping.

[730]


Duchess. Yes, my poor child!
Thou too hast lost a most affectionate godmother
In the Empress. O that stern unbending man!
In this unhappy marriage what have I
Not suffered, not endured. For ev'n as if 20
I had been linked on to some wheel of fire
That restless, ceaseless, whirls impetuous onward,
I have passed a life of frights and horrors with him,
And ever to the brink of some abyss
With dizzy headlong violence he whirls me. 25
Nay, do not weep, my child! Let not my sufferings
Presignify unhappiness to thee,
Nor blacken with their shade the fate that waits thee.
There lives no second Friedland: thou, my child,
Hast not to fear thy mother's destiny. 30

Thekla. O let us supplicate him, dearest mother!
Quick! quick! here's no abiding-place for us.
Here every coming hour broods into life
Some new affrightful monster.

Duchess. Thou wilt share
An easier, calmer lot, my child! We too, 35
I and thy father, witnessed happy days.
Still think I with delight of those first years,
When he was making progress with glad effort,
When his ambition was a genial fire,
Not that consuming flame which now it is. 40
The Emperor loved him, trusted him: and all
He undertook could not but be successful.
But since that ill-starred day at Regenspurg,
Which plunged him headlong from his dignity,
A gloomy uncompanionable spirit, 45
Unsteady and suspicious, has possessed him.
His quiet mind forsook him, and no longer
Did he yield up himself in joy and faith
To his old luck, and individual power;
But thenceforth turned his heart and best affections 50
All to those cloudy sciences, which never
Have yet made happy him who followed them.

Countess. You see it, sister! as your eyes permit you.
But surely this is not the conversation
To pass the time in which we are waiting for him. 55
You know he will be soon here. Would you have him
[731]
Find her in this condition?

Duchess. Come, my child!
Come, wipe away thy tears, and shew thy father
A cheerful countenance. See, the tie-knot here
Is off&mdash;this hair must not hang so dishevelled. 60
Come, dearest! dry thy tears up. They deform
Thy gentle eye&mdash;well now&mdash;what was I saying?
Yes, in good truth, this Piccolomini
Is a most noble and deserving gentleman.

Countess. That is he, sister!

Thekla (to the Countess). Aunt, you will excuse me? 65
[Is going.

Countess. But whither? See, your father comes.

Thekla. I cannot see him now.

Countess. Nay, but bethink you.

Thekla. Believe me, I cannot sustain his presence.

Countess. But he will miss you, will ask after you.

Duchess. What now? Why is she going? 70

Countess. She's not well.

Duchess. What ails then my beloved child?


[Both follow the Princess, and endeavour to detain her. During this
Wallenstein appears, engaged in conversation with Illo.

Scene IV

Wallenstein, Illo, Countess, Duchess, Thekla.


Wallenstein. All quiet in the camp?

Illo. It is all quiet.

Wallenstein. In a few hours may couriers come from Prague
With tidings, that this capital is ours.
Then we may drop the mask, and to the troops
Assembled in this town make known the measure 5
And its result together. In such cases
Example does the whole. Whoever is foremost
Still leads the herd. An imitative creature
Is man. The troops at Prague conceive no other,
Than that the Pilsen army has gone through 10
The forms of homage to us; and in Pilsen
They shall swear fealty to us, because
The example has been given them by Prague.
Butler, you tell me, has declared himself.

Illo. At his own bidding, unsolicited, 15
[732]
He came to offer you himself and regiment.

Wallenstein. I find we must not give implicit credence
To every warning voice that makes itself
Be listened to in the heart. To hold us back,
Oft does the lying spirit counterfeit 20
The voice of Truth and inward Revelation,
Scattering false oracles. And thus have I
To intreat forgiveness, for that secretly
I've wrong'd this honourable gallant man,
This Butler: for a feeling, of the which 25
I am not master (fear I would not call it),
Creeps o'er me instantly, with sense of shuddering,
At his approach, and stops love's joyous motion.
And this same man, against whom I am warned,
This honest man is he, who reaches to me 30
The first pledge of my fortune.

Illo. And doubt not
That his example will win over to you
The best men in the army.

Wallenstein. Go and send
Isolani hither. Send him immediately.
He is under recent obligations to me. 35
With him will I commence the trial. Go. [Illo exit.

Wallenstein (turns himself round to the females). Lo, there the mother with the darling daughter!
For once we'll have an interval of rest&mdash;
Come! my heart yearns to live a cloudless hour
In the beloved circle of my family. 40

Countess. 'Tis long since we've been thus together, brother.

Wallenstein (to the Countess aside). Can she sustain the news? Is she prepared?

Countess. Not yet.

Wallenstein. Come here, my sweet girl! Seat thee by me,
For there is a good spirit on thy lips.
Thy mother praised to me thy ready skill: 45
She says a voice of melody dwells in thee,
Which doth enchant the soul. Now such a voice
Will drive away from me the evil demon
That beats his black wings close above my head.

Duchess. Where is thy lute, my daughter? Let thy father 50
Hear some small trial of thy skill.

Thekla. My mother!
I&mdash;


[733]


Duchess. Trembling? Come, collect thyself. Go, cheer
Thy father.

Thekla. O my mother! I&mdash;I cannot.

Countess. How, what is that, niece?

Thekla (to the Countess). O spare me&mdash;sing&mdash;now&mdash;in this sore anxiety, 55
Of the o'erburthen'd soul&mdash;to sing to him,
Who is thrusting, even now, my mother headlong
Into her grave!

Duchess. How, Thekla? Humoursome?
What! shall thy father have expressed a wish
In vain?

Countess. Here is the lute.

Thekla. My God! how can I&mdash; 60


[The orchestra plays. During the ritornello Thekla expresses in her
gestures and countenance the struggle of her feelings: and at the moment
that she should begin to sing, contracts herself together, as one
shuddering, throws the instrument down, and retires abruptly.


Duchess. My child! O she is ill&mdash;

Wallenstein. What ails the maiden?
Say, is she often so?

Countess. Since then herself
Has now betrayed it, I too must no longer
Conceal it.

Wallenstein. What?

Countess. She loves him!

Wallenstein. Loves him! Whom?

Countess. Max does she love! Max Piccolomini. 65
Hast thou ne'er noticed it? Nor yet my sister?

Duchess. Was it this that lay so heavy on her heart?
God's blessing on thee, my sweet child! Thou needest
Never take shame upon thee for thy choice.

Countess. This journey, if 'twere not thy aim, ascribe it 70
To thine own self. Thou shouldest have chosen another
To have attended her.

Wallenstein. And does he know it?

Countess. Yes, and he hopes to win her.

Wallenstein. Hopes to win her!
Is the boy mad?

Countess. Well&mdash;hear it from themselves.

Wallenstein. He thinks to carry off Duke Friedland's daughter! 75
[734]
Aye?&mdash;The thought pleases me.
The young man has no grovelling spirit.

Countess. Since
Such and such constant favour you have shewn him&mdash;

Wallenstein. He chooses finally to be my heir.
And true it is, I love the youth; yea, honour him. 80
But must he therefore be my daughter's husband!
Is it daughters only? Is it only children
That we must shew our favour by?

Duchess. His noble disposition and his manners&mdash;

Wallenstein. Win him my heart, but not my daughter.

Duchess. Then 85
His rank, his ancestors&mdash;

Wallenstein. Ancestors! What?
He is a subject, and my son-in-law
I will seek out upon the thrones of Europe.

Duchess. O dearest Albrecht! Climb we not too high.
Lest we should fall too low.

Wallenstein. What? have I paid 90
A price so heavy to ascend this eminence,
And jut out high above the common herd,
Only to close the mighty part I play
In Life's great drama, with a common kinsman?
Have I for this&mdash; [pause.] She is the only thing 95
That will remain behind of me on earth;
And I will see a crown around her head,
Or die in the attempt to place it there.
I hazard all&mdash;all! and for this alone,
To lift her into greatness&mdash; 100
Yea, in this moment, in the which we are speaking&mdash; [pause.
And I must now, like a soft-hearted father,
Couple together in good peasant fashion
The pair, that chance to suit each other's liking&mdash;
And I must do it now, even now, when I 105
Am stretching out the wreath that is to twine
My full accomplished work&mdash;no! she is the jewel,
Which I have treasured long, my last, my noblest,
And 'tis my purpose not to let her from me
For less than a king's sceptre.

Duchess. O my husband! 110
You're ever building, building to the clouds,
[735]
Still building higher, and still higher building,
And ne'er reflect, that the poor narrow basis
Cannot sustain the giddy tottering column.

Wallenstein (to the Countess). Have you announced the place of residence 115
Which I have destined for her?

Countess. No! not yet.
'Twere better you yourself disclosed it to her.

Duchess. How? Do we not return to Karn then?

Wallenstein. No.

Duchess. And to no other of your lands or seats?

Wallenstein. You would not be secure there.

Duchess. Not secure 120
In the Emperor's realms, beneath the Emperor's
Protection?

Wallenstein. Friedland's wife may be permitted
No longer to hope that.

Duchess. O God in heaven!
And have you brought it even to this?

Wallenstein. In Holland
You'll find protection.

Duchess. In a Lutheran country? 125
What? And you send us into Lutheran countries?

Wallenstein. Duke Franz of Lauenburg conducts you thither.

Duchess. Duke Franz of Lauenburg?
The ally of Sweden, the Emperor's enemy.

Wallenstein. The Emperor's enemies are mine no longer. 130

Duchess (casting a look of terror on the Duke and the Countess). Is it then true? It is. You are degraded?
Deposed from the command? O God in heaven!

Countess (aside to the Duke). Leave her in this belief. Thou seest she cannot
Support the real truth.

To them enter Count Tertsky.


Countess. &mdash;Tertsky! 
What ails him? What an image of affright!
He looks as he had seen a ghost.

Tertsky (leading Wallenstein aside). Is it thy command that all the Croats&mdash;

Wallenstein. Mine! 5

[736]

Tertsky. We are betrayed.

Wallenstein. What?

Tertsky. They are off! This night
The J&auml;gers likewise&mdash;all the villages
In the whole round are empty.

Wallenstein. Isolani?

Tertsky. Him thou hast sent away. Yes, surely.

Wallenstein. I?

Tertsky. No! Hast thou not sent him off? Nor Deodate? 10
They are vanished both of them.




Scene VI

To them enter Illo.


Illo. Has Tertsky told thee?

Tertsky. He knows all.

Illo. And likewise
That Esterhatzy, Goetz, Maradas, Kaunitz,
Kolatto, Palfi, have forsaken thee?

Tertsky. Damnation!

Wallenstein (winks at them). Hush!

Countess (who has been watching them anxiously from the distance and now advances to them). Tertsky! Heaven! What is it? What has happened? 5

Wallenstein (scarcely suppressing his emotions). Nothing! let us be gone!

Tertsky (following him). Theresa, it is nothing.

Countess (holding him back). Nothing? Do I not see, that all the lifeblood
Has left your cheeks&mdash;look you not like a ghost?
That even my brother but affects a calmness? 10

Page (enters). An Aid-de-Camp enquires for the Count Tertsky. [Tertsky follows the Page.

Wallenstein. Go, hear his business. [To Illo.
This could not have happened
So unsuspected without mutiny.
Who was on guard at the gates?

Illo. 'Twas Tiefenbach. 15

Wallenstein. Let Tiefenbach leave guard without delay,
And Tertsky's grenadiers relieve him. [Illo is going.
Stop!
Hast thou heard aught of Butler?

Illo. Him I met.
He will be here himself immediately.
[737]
Butler remains unshaken.
[Illo exit. Wallenstein is following him.

Countess. Let him not leave thee, sister! go, detain him! 20
There's some misfortune.

Duchess (clinging to him). Gracious heaven! What is it?

Wallenstein. Be tranquil! leave me, sister! dearest wife!
We are in camp, and this is nought unusual;
Here storm and sunshine follow one another
With rapid interchanges. These fierce spirits 25
Champ the curb angrily, and never yet
Did quiet bless the temples of the leader.
If I am to stay, go you. The plaints of women
Ill suit the scene where men must act.
[He is going: Tertsky returns.

Tertsky. Remain here. From this window must we see it. 30

Wallenstein (to the Countess). Sister, retire!

Countess. No&mdash;never.

Wallenstein. 'Tis my will.

Tertsky (leads the Countess aside, and drawing her attention to the Duchess).
Theresa!

Duchess. Sister, come! since he commands it.

Scene VII

Wallenstein, Tertsky.


Wallenstein (stepping to the window). What now, then?

Tertsky. There are strange movements among all the troops,
And no one knows the cause. Mysteriously,
With gloomy silentness, the several corps
Marshal themselves, each under its own banners. 5
Tiefenbach's corps makes threatening movements; only
The Pappenheimers still remain aloof
In their own quarters, and let no one enter.

Wallenstein. Does Piccolomini appear among them?

Tertsky. We are seeking him: he is no where to be met with. 10

Wallenstein. What did the Aid-de-Camp deliver to you?

Tertsky. My regiments had dispatched him; yet once more
They swear fidelity to thee, and wait
The shout for onset, all prepared, and eager.

Wallenstein. But whence arose this larum in the camp? 15
It should have been kept secret from the army,
Till fortune had decided for us at Prague.

Tertsky. O that thou hadst believed me! Yester evening
[738]
Did we conjure thee not to let that skulker,
That fox, Octavio, pass the gates of Pilsen. 20
Thou gav'st him thy own horses to flee from thee.

Wallenstein. The old tune still! Now, once for all, no more
Of this suspicion&mdash;it is doting folly.

Tertsky. Thou did'st confide in Isolani too;
And lo! he was the first that did desert thee. 25

Wallenstein. It was but yesterday I rescued him
From abject wretchedness. Let that go by.
I never reckon'd yet on gratitude.
And wherein doth he wrong in going from me?
He follows still the god whom all his life 30
He has worshipped at the gaming table. With
My Fortune, and my seeming destiny,
He made the bond, and broke it not with me.
I am but the ship in which his hopes were stowed,
And with the which well-pleased and confident 35
He traversed the open sea; now he beholds it
In imminent jeopardy among the coast-rocks,
And hurries to preserve his wares. As light
As the free bird from the hospitable twig
Where it had nested, he flies off from me: 40
No human tie is snapped betwixt us two.
Yea, he deserves to find himself deceived,
Who seeks a heart in the unthinking man.
Like shadows on a stream, the forms of life
Impress their characters on the smooth forehead, 45
Nought sinks into the bosom's silent depth:
Quick sensibility of pain and pleasure
Moves the light fluids lightly; but no soul
Warmeth the inner frame.

Tertsky. Yet, would I rather
Trust the smooth brow than that deep furrowed one. 50

Scene VIII

Wallenstein, Tertsky, Illo.


Illo. Treason and mutiny!

Tertsky. And what further now?

Illo. Tiefenbach's soldiers, when I gave the orders
To go off guard&mdash;Mutinous villains!

Tertsky. Well!


[739]


Wallenstein. What followed?

Illo. They refused obedience to them. 5

Tertsky. Fire on them instantly! Give out the order.

Wallenstein. Gently! what cause did they assign?

Illo. No other,
They said, had right to issue orders but
Lieutenant-General Piccolomini.

Wallenstein. What? How is that? 10

Illo. He takes that office on him by commission,
Under sign-manual of the Emperor.

Tertsky. From the Emperor&mdash;hear'st thou, Duke?

Illo. At his incitement
The Generals made that stealthy flight&mdash;

Tertsky. Duke! hearest thou?

Illo. Caraffa too, and Montecuculi, 15
Are missing, with six other Generals,
All whom he had induced to follow him.
This plot he has long had in writing by him
From the Emperor; but 'twas finally concluded
With all the detail of the operation 20
Some days ago with the Envoy Questenberg.

To them enter the Countess.


Countess. This suspense,
This horrid fear&mdash;I can no longer bear it.
For heaven's sake, tell me, what has taken place.

Illo. The regiments are all falling off from us.

Tertsky. Octavio Piccolomini is a traitor. 5

Countess. O my foreboding! [Rushes out of the room.

Tertsky. Hadst thou but believed me!
Now seest thou how the stars have lied to thee.

Wallenstein. The stars lie not; but we have here a work
Wrought counter to the stars and destiny.
The science is still honest: this false heart 10
Forces a lie on the truth-telling heaven.
On a divine law divination rests;
Where nature deviates from that law, and stumbles
Out of her limits, there all science errs.
[740]
True, I did not suspect! Were it superstition 15
Never by such suspicion t' have affronted
The human form, O may that time ne'er come
In which I shame me of the infirmity.
The wildest savage drinks not with the victim
Into whose breast he means to plunge the sword. 20
This, this, Octavio, was no hero's deed:
'Twas not thy prudence that did conquer mine;
A bad heart triumphed o'er an honest one.
No shield received the assassin stroke; thou plungest
Thy weapon on an unprotected breast&mdash; 25
Against such weapons I am but a child.




Scene X

To these enter Butler.


Tertsky (meeting him). O look there! Butler! Here we've still a friend!

Wallenstein (meets him with outspread arms, and embraces him with warmth). Come to my heart, old comrade! Not the sun
Looks out upon us more revivingly
In the earliest month of spring,
Than a friend's countenance in such an hour. 5

Butler. My General: I come&mdash;

Wallenstein (leaning on Butler's shoulders). Know'st thou already?
That old man has betrayed me to the Emperor.
What say'st thou? Thirty years have we together
Lived out, and held out, sharing joy and hardship.
We have slept in one camp-bed, drunk from one glass, 10
One morsel shared! I leaned myself on him,
As now I lean me on thy faithful shoulder.
And now in the very moment, when, all love,
All confidence, my bosom beat to his,
He sees and takes the advantage, stabs the knife 15
Slowly into my heart.
[He hides his face on Butler's breast.

Butler. Forget the false one.
What is your present purpose?

Wallenstein. Well remembered!
Courage my soul! I am still rich in friends,
[741]
Still loved by Destiny; for in the moment,
That it unmasks the plotting hypocrite, 20
It sends and proves to me one faithful heart.
Of the hypocrite no more! Think not, his loss
Was that which struck the pang: O no! his treason
Is that which strikes this pang! No more of him!
Dear to my heart, and honoured were they both, 25
And the young man&mdash;yes&mdash;he did truly love me,
He&mdash;he&mdash;has not deceived me. But enough,
Enough of this&mdash;Swift counsel now beseems us.
The Courier, whom Count Kinsky sent from Prague
I expect him every moment: and whatever 30
He may bring with him, we must take good care
To keep it from the mutineers. Quick, then!
Dispatch some messenger you can rely on
To meet him, and conduct him to me. [Illo is going.

Butler (detaining him). My General, whom expect you then?

Wallenstein. The Courier 35
Who brings me word of the event at Prague.

Butler (hesitating). Hem!

Wallenstein. And what now?

Butler. You do not know it?

Wallenstein. Well?

Butler. From what that larum in the camp arose?

Wallenstein. From what?

Butler. That Courier.

Wallenstein. Well?

Butler. Is already here.

Tertsky and Illo (at the same time). Already here?

Wallenstein. My Courier?

Butler. For some hours. 40

Wallenstein. And I not know it?

Butler. The centinels detain him
In custody.

Illo. Damnation!

Butler. And his letter
Was broken open, and is circulated
Through the whole camp.

Wallenstein. You know what it contains?

Butler. Question me not.


[742]


Tertsky. Illo! alas for us. 45

Wallenstein. Hide nothing from me&mdash;I can hear the worst.
Prague then is lost. It is. Confess it freely.

Butler. Yes! Prague is lost. And all the several regiments
At Budweiss, Tabor, Brannau, Konigingratz,
At Brun and Znaym, have forsaken you, 50
And ta'en the oaths of fealty anew
To the Emperor. Yourself, with Kinsky, Tertsky,
And Illo have been sentenced.


[Tertsky and Illo express alarm and fury. Wallenstein remains firm and
collected.


Wallenstein. 'Tis decided!
'Tis well! I have received a sudden cure
From all the pangs of doubt: with steady stream 55
Once more my life-blood flows! My soul's secure!
In the night only Friedland's stars can beam.
Lingering irresolute, with fitful fears
I drew the sword&mdash;'twas with an inward strife,
While yet the choice was mine. The murderous knife 60
Is lifted for my heart! Doubt disappears!
I fight now for my head and for my life.

Scene XI


Countess Tertsky (enters from a side room). I can endure no
longer. No! [Looks around her.
Where are they?
No one is here. They leave me all alone,
Alone in this sore anguish of suspense.
And I must wear the outward shew of calmness
Before my sister, and shut in within me 5
The pangs and agonies of my crowded bosom.
It is not to be borne.&mdash;If all should fail;
If&mdash;if he must go over to the Swedes,
An empty-handed fugitive, and not
As an ally, a covenanted equal, 10
A proud commander with his army following;
If we must wander on from land to land,
Like the Count Palatine, of fallen greatness
An ignominious monument&mdash;But no!
That day I will not see! And could himself 15
Endure to sink so low, I would not bear
To see him so low sunken.

Scene XII

Countess, Duchess, Thekla.


Thekla (endeavouring to hold back the Duchess). Dear mother,
do stay here!

Duchess. No! Here is yet
Some frightful mystery that is hidden from me.
Why does my sister shun me? Don't I see her
Full of suspense and anguish roam about
From room to room?&mdash;Art thou not full of terror? 5
And what import these silent nods and gestures
Which stealthwise thou exchangest with her?

Thekla. Nothing:
Nothing, dear Mother!

Duchess (to the Countess). Sister, I will know.

Countess. What boots it now to hide it from her? Sooner
Or later she must learn to hear and bear it. 10
'Tis not the time now to indulge infirmity,
Courage beseems us now, a heart collected,
And exercise and previous discipline
Of fortitude. One word, and over with it!
Sister, you are deluded. You believe, 15
The Duke has been deposed&mdash;The Duke is not
Deposed&mdash;he is&mdash;&mdash;

Thekla (going to the Countess). What? do you wish to kill her?

Countess. The Duke is&mdash;&mdash;

Thekla (throwing her arms round her mother). O stand firm! stand firm, my mother!

Countess. Revolted is the Duke, he is preparing 20

ACT II

Scene I

Scene&mdash;A spacious Room in the Duke of Friedland's Palace.


Wallenstein (in armour). Thou hast gained thy point, Octavio! Once more am I
Almost as friendless as at Regenspurg.
[744]
There I had nothing left me, but myself&mdash;
But what one man can do, you have now experience.
The twigs have you hewed off, and here I stand 5
A leafless trunk. But in the sap within
Lives the creating power, and a new world
May sprout forth from it. Once already have I
Proved myself worth an army to you&mdash;I alone!
Before the Swedish strength your troops had melted; 10
Beside the Lech sank Tilly, your last hope;
Into Bavaria, like a winter torrent,
Did that Gustavus pour, and at Vienna
In his own palace did the Emperor tremble.
Soldiers were scarce, for still the multitude 15
Follow the luck: all eyes were turned on me,
Their helper in distress; the Emperor's pride
Bowed itself down before the man he had injured.
'Twas I must rise, and with creative word
Assemble forces in the desolate camps. 20
I did it. Like a god of war, my name
Went through the world. The drum was beat&mdash;and, lo!
The plough, the work-shop is forsaken, all
Swarm to the old familiar long-loved banners;
And as the wood-choir rich in melody 25
Assemble quick around the bird of wonder,
When first his throat swells with his magic song,
So did the warlike youth of Germany
Crowd in around the image of my eagle.
I feel myself the being that I was. 30
It is the soul that builds itself a body,
And Friedland's camp will not remain unfilled.
Lead then your thousands out to meet me&mdash;true!
They are accustomed under me to conquer,
But not against me. If the head and limbs 35
Separate from each other, 'twill be soon
Made manifest, in which the soul abode.


(Illo and Tertsky enter.)


Courage, friends! Courage! We are still unvanquished;
I feel my footing firm; five regiments, Tertsky,
Are still our own, and Butler's gallant troops; 40
And a host of sixteen thousand Swedes to-morrow.
I was not stronger, when nine years ago
[745]
I marched forth, with glad heart and high of hope,
To conquer Germany for the Emperor.

Scene II

Wallenstein, Illo, Tertsky. (To them enter Neumann, who leads Tertsky
aside, and talks with him.)


Tertsky. What do they want?

Wallenstein. What now?

Tertsky. Ten Cuirassiers
From Pappenheim request leave to address you
In the name of the regiment.

Wallenstein (hastily to Neumann). Let them enter.
[Exit Neumann.
This
May end in something. Mark you. They are still
Doubtful, and may be won. 5




Scene III

Wallenstein, Tertsky, Illo, Ten Cuirassiers (led by an
Anspessade,[745:1] march up and arrange themselves, after the word of
command, in one front before the Duke, and make their obeisance. He
takes his hat off, and immediately covers himself again).


Anspessade. Halt! Front! Present!

Wallenstein (after he has run through them with his eye, to the
Anspessade). I know thee well. Thou art out of Br&uuml;ggin in Flanders:
Thy name is Mercy.

Anspessade. Henry Mercy.



Wallenstein. Thou wert cut off on the march, surrounded
by the Hessians, and didst fight thy way with a hundred and 5
eighty men through their thousand.

Anspessade. 'Twas even so, General!

Wallenstein. What reward hadst thou for this gallant exploit?

Anspessade. That which I asked for: the honour to serve
in this corps. 10

Wallenstein (turning to a second). Thou wert among the
[746]
volunteers that seized and made booty of the Swedish battery
at Altenburg.

Second Cuirassier. Yes, General!

Wallenstein. I forget no one with whom I have exchanged 15
words. (A pause). Who sends you?

Anspessade. Your noble regiment, the Cuirassiers of
Piccolomini.

Wallenstein. Why does not your colonel deliver in your
request, according to the custom of service? 20

Anspessade. Because we would first know whom we serve.

Wallenstein. Begin your address.

Anspessade (giving the word of command). Shoulder your arms!

Wallenstein (turning to a third). Thy name is Risbeck, Cologne
is thy birthplace. 25

Third Cuirassier. Risbeck of Cologne.

Wallenstein. It was thou that broughtest in the Swedish
colonel, Diebald, prisoner, in the camp at Nuremberg.

Third Cuirassier. It was not I, General!

Wallenstein. Perfectly right! It was thy elder brother: 30
thou hadst a younger brother too: Where did he stay?

Third Cuirassier. He is stationed at Olmutz with the
Imperial army.

Wallenstein (to the Anspessade). Now then&mdash;begin.



Anspessade. There came to hand a letter from the Emperor 35
Commanding us&mdash;&mdash;

Wallenstein. Who chose you?

Anspessade. Every company
Drew its own man by lot.

Wallenstein. Now! to the business.

Anspessade. There came to hand a letter from the Emperor
Commanding us collectively, from thee
All duties of obedience to withdraw, 40
Because thou wert an enemy and traitor.

Wallenstein. And what did you determine?

Anspessade. All our comrades
At Brannau, Budweiss, Prague and Olmutz, have
Obeyed already, and the regiments here, 45
Tiefenbach and Toscana, instantly
Did follow their example. But&mdash;but we
Do not believe that thou art an enemy
And traitor to thy country, hold it merely
[747]
For lie and trick, and a trumped-up Spanish story! 50
Thyself shalt tell us what thy purpose is,
For we have found thee still sincere and true:
No mouth shall interpose itself betwixt
The gallant General and the gallant troops.

Wallenstein. Therein I recognize my Pappenheimers. 55

Anspessade. And this proposal makes thy regiment to thee:
Is it thy purpose merely to preserve
In thy own hands this military sceptre,
Which so becomes thee, which the Emperor
Made over to thee by a covenant? 60
Is it thy purpose merely to remain
Supreme commander of the Austrian armies?&mdash;
We will stand by thee, General! and guarantee
Thy honest rights against all opposition.
And should it chance, that all the other regiments 65
Turn from thee, by ourselves will we stand forth
Thy faithful soldiers, and, as is our duty,
Far rather let ourselves be cut to pieces,
Than suffer thee to fall. But if it be
As the Emperor's letter says, if it be true, 70
That thou in traitorous wise wilt lead us over
To the enemy, which God in heaven forbid!
Then we too will forsake thee, and obey
That letter&mdash;&mdash;

Wallenstein. Hear me, children!

Anspessade. Yes, or no!
There needs no other answer.

Wallenstein. Yield attention. 75
You're men of sense, examine for yourselves;
Ye think, and do not follow with the herd:
And therefore have I always shewn you honour
Above all others, suffered you to reason;
Have treated you as free men, and my orders 80
Were but the echoes of your prior suffrage.&mdash;

Anspessade. Most fair and noble has thy conduct been
To us, my General! With thy confidence
Thou hast honoured us, and shewn us grace and favour
Beyond all other regiments; and thou seest 85
We follow not the common herd. We will
Stand by thee faithfully. Speak but one word&mdash;
Thy word shall satisfy us, that it is not
[748]
A treason which thou meditatest&mdash;that
Thou meanest not to lead the army over 90
To the enemy; nor e'er betray thy country.

Wallenstein. Me, me are they betraying. The Emperor
Hath sacrificed me to my enemies,
And I must fall, unless my gallant troops
Will rescue me. See! I confide in you. 95
And be your hearts my strong hold! At this breast
The aim is taken, at this hoary head.
This is your Spanish gratitude, this is our
Requital for that murderous fight at Lutzen!
For this we threw the naked breast against 100
The halbert, made for this the frozen earth
Our bed, and the hard stone our pillow! never stream
Too rapid for us, nor wood too impervious:
With cheerful spirit we pursued that Mansfield
Through all the turns and windings of his flight; 105
Yea, our whole life was but one restless march;
And homeless, as the stirring wind, we travelled
O'er the war-wasted earth. And now, even now,
That we have well-nigh finished the hard toil,
The unthankful, the curse-laden toil of weapons, 110
With faithful indefatigable arm
Have rolled the heavy war-load up the hill,
Behold! this boy of the Emperor's bears away
The honours of the peace, an easy prize!
He'll weave, forsooth, into his flaxen locks 115
The olive branch, the hard-earn'd ornament
Of this grey head, grown grey beneath the helmet.

Anspessade. That shall he not, while we can hinder it!
No one, but thou, who hast conducted it
With fame, shall end this war, this frightful war. 120
Thou led'st us out into the bloody field
Of death, thou and no other shalt conduct us home,
Rejoicing, to the lovely plains of peace&mdash;
Shalt share with us the fruits of the long toil&mdash;

Wallenstein. What? Think you then at length in late old age 125
To enjoy the fruits of toil? Believe it not.
Never, no never, will you see the end
Of the contest! you and me, and all of us,
This war will swallow up! War, war, not peace,
Is Austria's wish; and therefore, because I 130
[749]
Endeavoured after peace, therefore I fall.
For what cares Austria, how long the war
Wears out the armies and lays waste the world?
She will but wax and grow amid the ruin,
And still win new domains.
[The Cuirassiers express agitation by their gestures.
Ye're moved&mdash;I see 135
A noble rage flash from your eyes, ye warriors!
Oh that my spirit might possess you now
Daring as once it led you to the battle!
Ye would stand by me with your veteran arms,
Protect me in my rights; and this is noble! 140
But think not that you can accomplish it,
Your scanty number! to no purpose will you
Have sacrificed you for your General.
No! let us tread securely, seek for friends;
The Swedes have proffered us assistance, let us 145
Wear for a while the appearance of good will,
And use them for your profit, till we both
Carry the fate of Europe in our hands,
And from our camp to the glad jubilant world
Lead Peace forth with the garland on her head! 150

Anspessade. 'Tis then but mere appearances which thou
Dost put on with the Swede? Thou'lt not betray
The Emperor? Wilt not turn us into Swedes?
This is the only thing which we desire
To learn from thee.

Wallenstein. What care I for the Swedes? 155
I hate them as I hate the pit of hell,
And under Providence I trust right soon
To chase them to their homes across their Baltic.
My cares are only for the whole: I have
A heart&mdash;it bleeds within me for the miseries 160
And piteous groaning of my fellow-Germans.
Ye are but common men, but yet ye think
With minds not common; ye appear to me
Worthy before all others, that I whisper ye
A little word or two in confidence! 165
See now! already for full fifteen years
The war-torch has continued burning, yet
No rest, no pause of conflict. Swede and German,
[750]
Papist and Lutheran! neither will give way
To the other, every hand's against the other. 170
Each one is party and no one a judge.
Where shall this end? Where's he that will unravel
This tangle, ever tangling more and more.
It must be cut asunder.
I feel that I am the man of destiny, 175
And trust, with your assistance, to accomplish it.

To these enter Butler.


Butler (passionately). General! This is not right!

Wallenstein. What is not right?

Butler. It must needs injure us with all honest men.

Wallenstein. But what?

Butler. It is an open proclamation
Of insurrection.

Wallenstein. Well, well&mdash;but what is it?

Butler. Count Tertsky's regiments tear the Imperial Eagle 5
From off the banners, and instead of it,
Have reared aloft thy arms.

Anspessade (abruptly to the Cuirassiers). Right about! March!

Wallenstein. Cursed be this counsel, and accursed who gave it!
[To the Cuirassiers, who are retiring.
Halt, children, halt! There's some mistake in this;
Hark!&mdash;I will punish it severely. Stop! 10
They do not hear. (To Illo.) Go after them, assure them,
And bring them back to me, cost what it may. [Illo hurries out.
This hurls us headlong. Butler! Butler!
You are my evil genius, wherefore must you
Announce it in their presence? It was all 15
In a fair way. They were half won, those madmen
With their improvident over-readiness&mdash;
A cruel game is fortune playing with me.
The zeal of friends it is that razes me,
And not the hate of enemies. 20




Scene V

To these enter the Duchess, who rushes into the Chamber. Thekla and the
Countess follow her.


Duchess. O Albrecht!
What hast thou done?

[751]

Wallenstein. And now comes this beside.

Countess. Forgive me, brother! It was not in my power.
They know all.

Duchess. What hast thou done?

Countess (to Tertsky). Is there no hope? Is all lost utterly? 5

Tertsky. All lost. No hope. Prague in the Emperor's hands,
The soldiery have ta'en their oaths anew.

Countess. That lurking hypocrite. Octavio!
Count Max is off too?

Tertsky. Where can he be? He's
Gone over to the Emperor with his father. 10


[Thekla rushes out into the arms of her mother, hiding her face in
her bosom.


Duchess (enfolding her in her arms). Unhappy child! and more unhappy mother!

Wallenstein (aside to Tertsky). Quick! Let a carriage stand in readiness
In the court behind the palace. Scherfenberg
Be their attendant; he is faithful to us;
To Egra he'll conduct them, and we follow. [To Illo, who returns. 15
Thou hast not brought them back?

Illo. Hear'st thou the uproar?
The whole corps of the Pappenheimers is
Drawn out: the younger Piccolomini,
Their colonel, they require; for they affirm,
That he is in the palace here, a prisoner; 20
And if thou dost not instantly deliver him,
They will find means to free him with the sword.

Tertsky. What shall we make of this?

Wallenstein. Said I not so?
O my prophetic heart! he is still here.
He has not betrayed me&mdash;he could not betray me. 25
I never doubted of it.

Countess. If he be
Still here, then all goes well; for I know what [Embracing Thekla.
Will keep him here for ever.

Tertsky. It can't be.
His father has betrayed us, is gone over

To stay behind.

Scene VI

To these enter Max Piccolomini.


Max. Yes! here he is! I can endure no longer
To creep on tiptoe round this house, and lurk
In ambush for a favourable moment.
This loitering, this suspense exceeds my powers. [Advancing to Thekla.
Turn not thine eyes away. O look upon me! 5
Confess it freely before all. Fear no one,
Let who will hear that we both love each other.
Wherefore continue to conceal it? Secrecy
Is for the happy&mdash;misery, hopeless misery,
Needeth no veil! Beneath a thousand suns 10
It dares act openly.
[He observes the Countess looking on Thekla with expressions of
triumph.
No, Lady! No!
Expect not, hope it not. I am not come
To stay: to bid farewell, farewell for ever.
For this I come! 'Tis over! I must leave thee!
Thekla, I must&mdash;must leave thee! Yet thy hatred 15
Let me not take with me. I pray thee, grant me
One look of sympathy, only one look.
Say that thou dost not hate me. Say it to me, Thekla! [Grasps her hand.
O God! I cannot leave this spot&mdash;I cannot!
Cannot let go this hand. O tell me, Thekla! 20
That thou dost suffer with me, art convinced
That I cannot act otherwise.


[Thekla, avoiding his look, points with her hand to her father. Max
turns round to the Duke, whom he had not till then perceived.


Thou here? It was not thou, whom here I sought.
I trusted never more to have beheld thee.
My business is with her alone. Here will I 25
Receive a full acquittal from this heart&mdash;
For any other I am no more concerned.

Wallenstein. Think'st thou, that fool-like, I shall let thee go,
And act the mock-magnanimous with thee?
Thy father is become a villain to me; 30
[753]
I hold thee for his son, and nothing more:
Nor to no purpose shalt thou have been given
Into my power. Think not, that I will honour
That ancient love, which so remorselessly
He mangled. They are now past by, those hours 35
Of friendship and forgiveness. Hate and vengeance
Succeed&mdash;'tis now their turn&mdash;I too can throw
All feelings of the man aside&mdash;can prove
Myself as much a monster as thy father!

Max. Thou wilt proceed with me, as thou hast power. 40
Thou know'st, I neither brave nor fear thy rage.
What has detained me here, that too thou know'st. [Taking Thekla by the hand.
See, Duke! All&mdash;all would I have owed to thee,
Would have received from thy paternal hand
The lot of blessed spirits. This hast thou 45
Laid waste for ever&mdash;that concerns not thee.
Indifferent thou tramplest in the dust
Their happiness, who most are thine. The god
Whom thou dost serve, is no benignant deity.
Like as the blind irreconcileable 50
Fierce element, incapable of compact,
Thy heart's wild impulse only dost thou follow.[753:1]

Wallenstein. Thou art describing thy own father's heart.
[754]
The adder! O, the charms of hell o'erpowered me.
He dwelt within me, to my inmost soul 55
Still to and fro he passed, suspected never!
On the wide ocean, in the starry heaven
Did mine eyes seek the enemy, whom I
In my heart's heart had folded! Had I been
To Ferdinand what Octavio was to me, 60
War had I ne'er denounced against him. No,
I never could have done it. The Emperor was
My austere master only, not my friend.
There was already war 'twixt him and me
When he delivered the Commander's Staff 65
Into my hands; for there's a natural
Unceasing war 'twixt cunning and suspicion;
Peace exists only betwixt confidence
And faith. Who poisons confidence, he murders
The future generations.

Max. I will not 70
Defend my father. Woe is me, I cannot!
Hard deeds and luckless have ta'en place, one crime
Drags after it the other in close link.
[755]
But we are innocent: how have we fallen
Into this circle of mishap and guilt? 75
To whom have we been faithless? Wherefore must
The evil deeds and guilt reciprocal
Of our two fathers twine like serpents round us?
Why must our fathers'
Unconquerable hate rend us asunder,
Who love each other?

Wallenstein. Max, remain with me. 80
Go you not from me, Max! Hark! I will tell thee&mdash;
How when at Prague, our winter quarters, thou
Wert brought into my tent a tender boy,
Not yet accustomed to the German winters;
Thy hand was frozen to the heavy colours; 85
Thou would'st not let them go.&mdash;
At that time did I take thee in my arms,
And with my mantle did I cover thee;
I was thy nurse, no woman could have been
A kinder to thee; I was not ashamed 90
To do for thee all little offices,
However strange to me; I tended thee
Till life returned; and when thine eyes first opened,
I had thee in my arms. Since then, when have I
Altered my feelings towards thee? Many thousands 95
Have I made rich, presented them with lands;
Rewarded them with dignities and honours;
Thee have I loved: my heart, my self, I gave
To thee! They all were aliens: thou wert
Our child and inmate.[755:1] Max! Thou canst not leave me; 100
It cannot be; I may not, will not think
That Max can leave me.

Max. O my God!

Wallenstein. I have
Held and sustained thee from thy tottering childhood.
What holy bond is there of natural love?
What human tie, that does not knit thee to me? 105
I love thee, Max! What did thy father for thee,
[756]
Which I too have not done, to the height of duty?
Go hence, forsake me, serve thy Emperor;
He will reward thee with a pretty chain
Of gold; with his ram's fleece will he reward thee; 110
For that the friend, the father of thy youth,
For that the holiest feeling of humanity,
Was nothing worth to thee.

Max. O God! how can I
Do otherwise? Am I not forced to do it?
My oath&mdash;my duty&mdash;honour&mdash;

Wallenstein. How? Thy duty? 115
Duty to whom? Who art thou? Max! bethink thee
What duties may'st thou have? If I am acting
A criminal part toward the Emperor,
It is my crime, not thine. Dost thou belong
To thine own self? Art thou thine own commander? 120
Stand'st thou, like me, a freeman in the world,
That in thy actions thou should'st plead free agency?
On me thou'rt planted, I am thy Emperor;
To obey me, to belong to me, this is
Thy honour, this a law of nature to thee! 125
And if the planet, on the which thou liv'st
And hast thy dwelling, from its orbit starts,
It is not in thy choice, whether or no
Thou'lt follow it. Unfelt it whirls thee onward
Together with his ring and all his moons. 130
With little guilt stepp'st thou into this contest,
Thee will the world not censure, it will praise thee,
For that thou heldst thy friend more worth to thee
Than names and influences more removed.
For justice is the virtue of the ruler, 135
Affection and fidelity the subject's.
Not every one doth it beseem to question
The far-off high Arcturus. Most securely
Wilt thou pursue the nearest duty&mdash;let
The pilot fix his eye upon the pole-star. 140




FOOTNOTES:

[753:1] I have here ventured to omit a considerable number of
lines. I fear that I should not have done amiss, had I taken this
liberty more frequently. It is, however, incumbent on me to give the
original with a literal translation.


Weh denen die auf dich vertraun, an Dich
Die sichre H&uuml;tte ihres Gl&uuml;ckes lehnen,
Gelockt von deiner gastlichen Gestalt.
Schnell, unverhofft, bei n&auml;chtlich stiller Weile
G&auml;hrt's in dem t&uuml;ckschen Feuerschlunde, ladet
Sich aus mit tobender Gewalt, und weg
Treibt &uuml;ber alle Pflanzungen der Menschen
Der wilde Strom in grausender Zerst&ouml;rung.

Wallenstein.

Du schilderst deines Vaters Herz. Wie Du's
Beschreibst, so ist's in seinem Eingeweide,
In dieser schwarzen Heuchlersbrust gestaltet.
O mich hat H&ouml;llenkunst get&auml;uscht. Mir sandte
Der Abgrund den verstecktesten der Geister,
Den L&uuml;gekundigsten herauf, und stellt' ihn
Als Freund an meine Seite. Wer vermag
Der H&ouml;lle Macht zu widerstehn! Ich zog
Den Basilisken auf an meinem Busen,
Mit meinem Herzblut n&auml;hrt' ich ihn, er sog
Sich schwelgend voll an meiner Liebe Br&uuml;sten.
Ich hatte nimmer Arges gegen ihn,
Weit offen Hess ich des Gedankens Thore,
Und warf die Schl&uuml;ssel weiser Vorsicht weg,
Am Sternenhimmel, &amp;c.


Literal Translation.

Alas! for those who place their confidence on thee, against thee lean
the secure hut of their fortune, allured by thy hospitable form.
Suddenly, unexpectedly, in a moment still as night, there is a
fermentation in the treacherous gulf of fire; it discharges itself with
raging force, and away over all the plantations of men drives the wild
stream in frightful devastation. Wallenstein. Thou art portraying thy
father's heart; as thou describest, even so is it shaped in his
entrails, in this black hypocrite's breast. O, the art of hell has
deceived me! The Abyss sent up to me the most spotted of the spirits,
the most skilful in lies, and placed him as a friend by my side. Who may
withstand the power of hell? I took the basilisk to my bosom, with my
heart's blood I nourished him; he sucked himself glutfull at the breasts
of my love. I never harboured evil towards him; wide open did I leave
the door of my thoughts; I threw away the key of wise foresight. In the
starry heaven, &amp;c.&mdash;We find a difficulty in believing this to have been
written by Schiller. 1800, 1828, 1829. I have here ventured to
omit a considerable number of lines, which it is difficult to believe
that Schiller could have written. 1834.

[755:1] This is a poor and inadequate translation of the
affectionate simplicity of the original&mdash;

Wallenstein. What now?

Neumann. The Pappenheimers are dismounted,
[757]
And are advancing now on foot, determined
With sword in hand to storm the house, and free
The Count, their colonel.

Wallenstein (to Tertsky). Have the cannon planted.
I will receive them with chain-shot. [Exit Tertsky. 5
Prescribe to me with sword in hand! Go, Neumann!
'Tis my command that they retreat this moment,
And in their ranks in silence wait my pleasure.


[Neumann exit. Illo steps to the window.


Countess. Let him go, I entreat thee, let him go.

Illo (at the window). Hell and perdition!

Wallenstein. What is it? 10

Illo. They scale the council-house, the roof's uncovered.
They level at this house the cannon&mdash;&mdash;

Max. Madmen!

Illo. They are making preparations now to fire on us.

Duchess and Countess. Merciful Heaven!

Max (to Wallenstein). Let me go to them!

Wallenstein. Not a step!

Max (pointing to Thekla and the Duchess). But their life! Thine! 15

Wallenstein. What tidings bring'st thou, Tertsky?




Scene VIII

To these Tertsky (returning).


Tertsky. Message and greeting from our faithful regiments.
Their ardour may no longer be curbed in.
They intreat permission to commence the attack,
And if thou would'st but give the word of onset,
They could now charge the enemy in rear, 5
Into the city wedge them, and with ease
O'erpower them in the narrow streets.

Illo. O come!
Let not their ardour cool. The soldiery
Of Butler's corps stand by us faithfully;
We are the greater number. Let us charge them, 10
And finish here in Pilsen the revolt.

Wallenstein. What? shall this town become a field of slaughter,
And brother-killing Discord, fire-eyed,
Be let loose through its streets to roam and rage?
[758]
Shall the decision be delivered over 15
To deaf remorseless Rage, that hears no leader?
Here is not room for battle, only for butchery.
Well, let it be! I have long thought of it,
So let it burst then! [Turns to Max.
Well, how is it with thee?
Wilt thou attempt a heat with me. Away! 20
Thou art free to go. Oppose thyself to me,
Front against front, and lead them to the battle;
Thou'rt skilled in war, thou hast learned somewhat under me,
I need not be ashamed of my opponent,
And never had'st thou fairer opportunity 25
To pay me for thy schooling.

Countess. Is it then,
Can it have come to this?&mdash;What! Cousin, Cousin!
Have you the heart?

Max. The regiments that are trusted to my care
I have pledged my troth to bring away from Pilsen 30
True to the Emperor, and this promise will I
Make good, or perish. More than this no duty
Requires of me. I will not fight against thee,
Unless compelled; for though an enemy,
Thy head is holy to me still. 35


[Two reports of cannon. Illo and Tertsky hurry to the window.


Wallenstein. What's that?

Tertsky. He falls.

Wallenstein. Falls! Who?

Illo. Tiefenbach's corps
Discharged the ordnance.

Wallenstein. Upon whom?

Illo. On Neumann,
Your messenger.

Wallenstein (starting up). Ha! Death and hell! I will&mdash;

Tertsky. Expose thyself to their blind frenzy?

Duchess and Countess. No!
For God's sake, no!

Illo. Not yet, my General! 40

Countess. O, hold him! hold him!

Wallenstein. Leave me&mdash;&mdash;

Max. Do it not
Not yet! This rash and bloody deed has thrown them
Into a frenzy-fit&mdash;allow them time&mdash;&mdash;


[759]


Wallenstein. Away! too long already have I loitered.
They are emboldened to these outrages, 45
Beholding not my face. They shall behold
My countenance, shall hear my voice&mdash;&mdash;
Are they not my troops? Am I not their General,
And their long-feared commander? Let me see,
Whether indeed they do no longer know 50
That countenance, which was their sun in battle!
From the balcony (mark!) I shew myself
To these rebellious forces, and at once
Revolt is mounded, and the high-swoln current
Shrinks back into the old bed of obedience. 55

Scene IX

Countess, Duchess, Max, and Thekla.


Countess (to the Duchess). Let them but see him&mdash;there is hope still, sister.

Duchess. Hope! I have none!

Max (who during the last scene has been standing at a distance,
advances). This can I not endure.
With most determined soul did I come hither,
My purposed action seemed unblameable
To my own conscience&mdash;and I must stand here 5
Like one abhorred, a hard inhuman being;
Yea, loaded with the curse of all I love!
Must see all whom I love in this sore anguish,
Whom I with one word can make happy&mdash;O!
My heart revolts within me, and two voices 10
Make themselves audible within my bosom.
My soul's benighted; I no longer can
Distinguish the right track. O, well and truly
Didst thou say, father, I relied too much
On my own heart. My mind moves to and fro&mdash; 15
I know not what to do.

Countess. What! you know not?
Does not your own heart tell you? O! then I
Will tell it you. Your father is a traitor,
[760]
A frightful traitor to us&mdash;he has plotted
Against our General's life, has plunged us all 20
In misery&mdash;and you're his son! 'Tis yours
To make the amends&mdash;Make you the son's fidelity
Outweigh the father's treason, that the name
Of Piccolomini be not a proverb
Of infamy, a common form of cursing 25
To the posterity of Wallenstein.

Max. Where is that voice of truth which I dare follow?
It speaks no longer in my heart. We all
But utter what our passionate wishes dictate:
O that an angel would descend from Heaven, 30
And scoop for me the right, the uncorrupted,
With a pure hand from the pure Fount of Light.
[His eyes glance on Thekla.
What other angel seek I? To this heart,
To this unerring heart, will I submit it,
Will ask thy love, which has the power to bless 35
The happy man alone, averted ever
From the disquieted and guilty&mdash;canst thou
Still love me, if I stay? Say that thou canst,
And I am the Duke's&mdash;&mdash;

Countess. Think, niece&mdash;&mdash;

Max. Think nothing, Thekla!
Speak what thou feelest.

Countess. Think upon your father. 40

Max. I did not question thee, as Friedland's daughter.
Thee, the beloved and the unerring god
Within thy heart, I question. What's at stake?
Not whether diadem of royalty
Be to be won or not&mdash;that might'st thou think on. 45
Thy friend, and his soul's quiet, are at stake;
The fortune of a thousand gallant men,
Who will all follow me; shall I forswear
My oath and duty to the Emperor?
Say, shall I send into Octavio's camp 50
The parricidal ball? For when the ball
Has left its cannon, and is on its flight,
It is no longer a dead instrument!
It lives, a spirit passes into it,
[761]
The avenging furies seize possession of it, 55
And with sure malice guide it the worst way.

Thekla. O! Max&mdash;&mdash;

Max. Nay, not precipitately either, Thekla.
I understand thee. To thy noble heart
The hardest duty might appear the highest.
The human, not the great part, would I act. 60
Ev'n from my childhood to this present hour,
Think what the Duke has done for me, how loved me,
And think too, how my father has repaid him.
O likewise the free lovely impulses
Of hospitality, the pious friend's 65
Faithful attachment, these too are a holy
Religion to the heart; and heavily
The shudderings of nature do avenge
Themselves on the barbarian that insults them.
Lay all upon the balance, all&mdash;then speak, 70
And let thy heart decide it.

Thekla. O, thy own
Hath long ago decided. Follow thou
Thy heart's first feeling&mdash;&mdash;

Countess. Oh! ill-fated woman!

Thekla. Is it possible, that that can be the right,
The which thy tender heart did not at first 75
Detect and seize with instant impulse? Go,
Fulfil thy duty! I should ever love thee.
Whate'er thou had'st chosen, thou would'st still have acted
Nobly and worthy of thee&mdash;but repentance
Shall ne'er disturb thy soul's fair peace.

Max. Then I 80
Must leave thee, must part from thee!

Thekla. Being faithful
To thine own self, thou art faithful too to me:
If our fates part, our hearts remain united.
A bloody hatred will divide for ever
The houses Piccolomini and Friedland; 85
But we belong not to our houses&mdash;Go!
Quick! quick! and separate thy righteous cause
From our unholy and unblessed one!
The curse of heaven lies upon our head:
'Tis dedicate to ruin. Even me 90
My father's guilt drags with it to perdition.
Mourn not for me:
[762]
My destiny will quickly be decided.


[Max clasps her in his arms. There is heard from behind the Scene a
loud, wild, long continued cry, 'Vivat Ferdinandus,' accompanied by
warlike instruments.

To these enter Wallenstein, accompanied by Illo and Butler.


Wallenstein (as he enters). Tertsky!

Tertsky. My General?

Wallenstein. Let our regiments hold themselves
In readiness to march; for we shall leave
Pilsen ere evening. [Exit Tertsky.
Butler!

Butler. Yes, my General.

Wallenstein. The Governor at Egra is your friend 5
And countryman. Write to him instantly
By a Post Courier. He must be advised,
That we are with him early on the morrow.
You follow us yourself, your regiment with you.

Butler. It shall be done, my General!

Wallenstein (steps between Max and Thekla). Part!

Max. O God! 10


[Cuirassiers enter with drawn swords, and assemble in [763]the back-ground.
At the same time there are heard from below some spirited passages out
of the Pappenheim March, which seem to address Max.


Wallenstein (to the Cuirassiers). Here he is, he is at liberty: I keep him
No longer.


[He turns away, and stands so that Max cannot pass by him nor approach
the Princess.


Max. Thou know'st that I have not yet learnt to live
Without thee! I go forth into a desert,
Leaving my all behind me. O do not turn 15
Thine eyes away from me! O once more shew me
Thy ever dear and honoured countenance.

[Max attempts to take his hand, but is repelled; he turns to the
Countess.

Is there no eye that has a look of pity for me?

[The Countess turns away from him; he turns to the Duchess.

My mother!

Duchess. Go where duty calls you. Haply
The time may come, when you may prove to us 20
A true friend, a good angel at the throne
Of the Emperor.

Max. You give me hope; you would not
Suffer me wholly to despair. No! No!
Mine is a certain misery&mdash;Thanks to heaven
That offers me a means of ending it. 25


[The military music begins again. The stage fills more and more with
armed men. Max sees Butler, and addresses him.


And you here, Colonel Butler&mdash;and will you
Not follow me? Well, then! remain more faithful
To your new lord, than you have proved yourself
To the Emperor. Come, Butler! promise me,
Give me your hand upon it, that you'll be 30
The guardian of his life, its shield, its watchman.
He is attainted, and his princely head
Fair booty for each slave that trades in murder.
Now he doth need the faithful eye of friendship,
And those whom here I see&mdash; [Casting suspicious looks on Illo and Butler.

Illo. Go&mdash;seek for traitors 35
In Galas', in your father's quarters. Here
[764]
Is only one. Away! away! and free us
From his detested sight! Away!


[Max attempts once more to approach Thekla. Wallenstein prevents him.
Max stands irresolute, and in apparent anguish. In the mean time the
stage fills more and more; and the horns sound from below louder and
louder, and each time after a shorter interval.


Max. Blow, blow! O were it but the Swedish Trumpets,
And all the naked swords, which I see here, 40
Were plunged into my breast! What purpose you?
You come to tear me from this place! Beware,
Ye drive me not in desperation.&mdash;Do it not!
Ye may repent it! [The stage is entirely filled with armed men.
Yet more! weight upon weight to drag me down! 45
Think what ye're doing. It is not well done
To choose a man despairing for your leader;
You tear me from my happiness. Well, then,
I dedicate your souls to vengeance. Mark!
For your own ruin you have chosen me: 50
Who goes with me, must be prepared to perish.


[He turns to the background, there ensues a sudden and violent movement
among the Cuirassiers; they surround him, and carry him off in wild
tumult. Wallenstein remains immovable. Thekla sinks into her mother's
arms. The curtain falls. The music becomes loud and overpowering, and
passes into a complete war-march&mdash;the orchestra joins it&mdash;and continues
during the interval between the second and third Act.

Butler and Gordon.


Gordon. Is it you?
How my heart sinks! The Duke a fugitive traitor!
His princely head attainted! O my God!

Butler. You have received the letter which I sent you
By a post-courier?

Gordon. Yes! and in obedience to it 5
Opened the strong hold to him without scruple.
For an imperial letter orders me
To follow your commands implicitly.
But yet forgive me; when even now I saw
The Duke himself, my scruples recommenced. 10
For truly, not like an attainted man,
Into this town did Friedland make his entrance;
His wonted majesty beamed from his brow,
And calm, as in the days when all was right,
Did he receive from me the accounts of office; 15
'Tis said, that fallen pride learns condescension:
But sparing and with dignity the Duke
Weighed every syllable of approbation,
As masters praise a servant who has done
His duty, and no more.

Butler. 'Tis all precisely 20
As I related in my letter. Friedland
Has sold the army to the enemy,
And pledged himself to give up Prague and Egra.
On this report the regiments all forsook him,
The five excepted that belong to Tertsky, 25
And which have followed him, as thou hast seen.
The sentence of attainder is passed on him,
And every loyal subject is required
To give him in to justice, dead or living.

Gordon. A traitor to the Emperor&mdash;Such a noble! 30
Of such high talents! What is human greatness!
I often said, this can't end happily.
His might, his greatness, and this obscure power
[766]
Are but a covered pit-fall. The human being
May not be trusted to self-government. 35
The clear and written law, the deep trod foot-marks
Of ancient custom, are all necessary
To keep him in the road of faith and duty.
The authority entrusted to this man
Was unexampled and unnatural 40
It placed him on a level with his Emperor,
Till the proud soul unlearned submission. Wo is me;
I mourn for him! for where he fell, I deem
Might none stand firm. Alas! dear General,
We in our lucky mediocrity 45
Have ne'er experienced, cannot calculate,
What dangerous wishes such a height may breed
In the heart of such a man.

Butler. Spare your laments
Till he need sympathy; for at this present
He is still mighty, and still formidable. 50
The Swedes advance to Egra by forced marches,
And quickly will the junction be accomplished.
This must not be! The Duke must never leave
This strong hold on free footing; for I have
Pledged life and honour here to hold him prisoner, 55
And your assistance 'tis on which I calculate.

Gordon. O that I had not lived to see this day!
From his hand I received this dignity,
He did himself entrust this strong hold to me,
Which I am now required to make his dungeon. 60
We subalterns have no will of our own:
The free, the mighty man alone may listen
To the fair impulse of his human nature.
Ah! we are but the poor tools of the law,
Obedience the sole virtue we dare aim at! 65

Butler. Nay, let it not afflict you, that your power
Is circumscribed. Much liberty, much error!
The narrow path of duty is securest.

Gordon. And all then have deserted him, you say?
He has built up the luck of many thousands; 70
For kingly was his spirit: his full hand
Was ever open! Many a one from dust
Hath he selected, from the very dust
Hath raised him into dignity and honour.
[767]
And yet no friend, not one friend hath he purchased, 75
Whose heart beats true to him in the evil hour.

Butler. Here's one, I see.

Gordon. I have enjoyed from him
No grace or favour. I could almost doubt,
If ever in his greatness he once thought on
An old friend of his youth. For still my office 80
Kept me at distance from him; and when first
He to this citadel appointed me,
He was sincere and serious in his duty.
I do not then abuse his confidence,
If I preserve my fealty in that 85
Which to my fealty was first delivered.

Butler. Say, then, will you fulfil the attainder on him?

Gordon. If it be so&mdash;if all be as you say&mdash;
If he've betrayed the Emperor, his master,
Have sold the troops, have purposed to deliver 90
The strong holds of the country to the enemy&mdash;
Yea, truly!&mdash;-there is no redemption for him!
Yet it is hard, that me the lot should destine
To be the instrument of his perdition;
For we were pages at the court of Bergau 95
At the same period; but I was the senior.

Butler. I have heard so&mdash;&mdash;

Gordon. 'Tis full thirty years since then.
A youth who scarce had seen his twentieth year
Was Wallenstein, when he and I were friends:
Yet even then he had a daring soul: 100
His frame of mind was serious and severe
Beyond his years: his dreams were of great objects.
He walked amidst us of a silent spirit,
Communing with himself: yet I have known him
Transported on a sudden into utterance 105
Of strange conceptions; kindling into splendour
His soul revealed itself, and he spake so
That we looked round perplexed upon each other,
Not knowing whether it were craziness,
Or whether it were a god that spoke in him. 110

Butler. But was it where he fell two story high
From a window-ledge, on which he had fallen asleep;
And rose up free from injury? From this day
(It is reported) he betrayed clear marks
[768]
Of a distempered fancy.

Gordon. He became 115
Doubtless more self-enwrapt and melancholy;
He made himself a Catholic. Marvellously
His marvellous preservation had transformed him.
Thenceforth he held himself for an exempted
And privileged being, and, as if he were 120
Incapable of dizziness or fall,
He ran along the unsteady rope of life.
But now our destinies drove us asunder:
He paced with rapid step the way of greatness,
Was Count, and Prince, Duke-regent, and Dictator. 125
And now is all, all this too little for him;
He stretches forth his hands for a king's crown,
And plunges in unfathomable ruin.

Butler. No more, he comes.

To these enter Wallenstein, in conversation with the Burgomaster of

Wallenstein. You were at one time a free town. I see,
Ye bear the half eagle in your city arms.
Why the half eagle only?

Burgomaster. We were free,
But for these last two hundred years has Egra
Remained in pledge to the Bohemian crown, 5
Therefore we bear the half eagle, the other half
Being cancelled till the empire ransom us,
If ever that should be.

Wallenstein. Ye merit freedom.
Only be firm and dauntless. Lend your ears
To no designing whispering court-minions. 10
What may your imposts be?

Burgomaster. So heavy that
We totter under them. The garrison
Lives at our costs.

Wallenstein. I will relieve you. Tell me,
There are some Protestants among you still? [The Burgomaster hesitates.
Yes, yes; I know it. Many lie concealed 15
[769]
Within these walls&mdash;Confess now&mdash;you yourself&mdash;
Be not alarmed. I hate the Jesuits.
Could my will have determined it, they had
Been long ago expelled the empire. Trust me&mdash;
Mass-book or Bible&mdash;'tis all one to me. 20
Of that the world has had sufficient proof.
I built a church for the reformed in Glogan
At my own instance. Hark'e, Burgomaster!
What is your name?

Burgomaster. Pachh&auml;lbel, may it please you.

Wallenstein. Hark'e!&mdash;&mdash; 25
But let it go no further, what I now
Disclose to you in confidence. [Laying his hand on the Burgomaster's shoulder.
The times
Draw near to their fulfilment, Burgomaster!
The high will fall, the low will be exalted.
Hark'e! But keep it to yourself! The end 30
Approaches of the Spanish double monarchy&mdash;
A new arrangement is at hand. You saw
The three moons that appeared at once in the Heaven.

Burgomaster. With wonder and affright!

Wallenstein. Whereof did two
Strangely transform themselves to bloody daggers. 35
And only one, the middle moon, remained
Steady and clear.

Burgomaster. We applied it to the Turks.

Wallenstein. The Turks! That all?&mdash;I tell you, that two empires
Will set in blood, in the East and in the West,
And Luth'ranism alone remain. [Observing Gordon and Butler.
I'faith, 40
'Twas a smart cannonading that we heard
This evening, as we journeyed hitherward;
'Twas on our left hand. Did you hear it here?

Gordon. Distinctly. The wind brought it from the South.

Butler. It seemed to come from Weiden or from Neustadt. 45

Wallenstein. Tis likely. That's the route the Swedes are taking.
[770]
How strong is the garrison?

Gordon. Not quite two hundred
Competent men, the rest are invalids.

Wallenstein. Good! And how many in the vale of Jochim?

Gordon. Two hundred arquebussiers have I sent thither 50
To fortify the posts against the Swedes.

Wallenstein. Good! I commend your foresight. At the works too
You have done somewhat?

Gordon. Two additional batteries
I caused to be run up. They were needless.
The Rhinegrave presses hard upon us, General! 55

Wallenstein. You have been watchful in your Emperor's service.
I am content with you, Lieutenant-Colonel. [To Butler.
Release the outposts in the vale of Jochim
With all the stations in the enemy's route. [To Gordon.
Governor, in your faithful hands I leave 60
My wife, my daughter, and my sister. I
Shall make no stay here, and wait but the arrival
Of letters, to take leave of you, together
With all the regiments.

Scene IV

To these enter Count Tertsky.


Tertsky. Joy, General; joy! I bring you welcome tidings.

Wallenstein. And what may they be?

Tertsky. There has been an engagement
At Neustadt; the Swedes gained the victory.

Wallenstein. From whence did you receive the intelligence?

Tertsky. A countryman from Tirschenseil conveyed it. 5
Soon after sunrise did the fight begin!
A troop of the Imperialists from Fachau
Had forced their way into the Swedish camp;
The cannonade continued full two hours;
There were left dead upon the field a thousand 10
Imperialists, together with their Colonel;
Further than this he did not know.

Wallenstein. How came
Imperial troops at Neustadt? Altringer,
But yesterday, stood sixty miles from there.
Count Galas' force collects at Frauenberg, 15
[771]
And have not the full complement. Is it possible,
That Suys perchance had ventured so far onward?
It cannot be.

Tertsky. We shall soon know the whole,
For here comes Illo, full of haste, and joyous.




Scene V

To these enter Illo.


Illo (to Wallenstein). A courier, Duke! he wishes to speak with thee.

Tertsky. Does he bring confirmation of the victory?

Wallenstein. What does he bring? Whence comes he?

Illo. From the Rhinegrave.
And what he brings I can announce to you
Beforehand. Seven leagues distant are the Swedes; 5
At Neustadt did Max Piccolomini
Throw himself on them with the cavalry;
A murderous fight took place! o'erpower'd by numbers
The Pappenheimers all, with Max their leader,
Were left dead on the field. 10

Wallenstein (after a pause). Where is the messenger? Conduct me to him.


[Wallenstein is going, when Lady Neubrunn rushes into the room. Some
servants follow her and run across the stage.


Neubrunn. Help! Help!

Illo and Tertsky (at the same time). What now?

Neubrunn. The Princess!

Wallenstein and Tertsky. Does she know it?

Neubrunn. She is dying!


[Hurries off the stage, when Wallenstein and Tertsky follow her.

Scene VI

Butler and Gordon.


Gordon. What's this?

Butler. She has lost the man she lov'd&mdash;
Young Piccolomini, who fell in the battle.


[772]


Gordon. Unfortunate Lady!

Butler. You have heard what Illo
Reporteth, that the Swedes are conquerors,
And marching hitherward.

Gordon. Too well I heard it. 5

Butler. They are twelve regiments strong, and there are five
Close by us to protect the Duke. We have
Only my single regiment; and the garrison
Is not two hundred strong.

Gordon. 'Tis even so.

Butler. It is not possible with such small force 10
To hold in custody a man like him.

Gordon. I grant it.

Butler. Soon the numbers would disarm us.
And liberate him.

Gordon. It were to be feared.

Butler (after a pause). Know, I am warranty for the event;
With my head have I pledged myself for his, 15
Must make my word good, cost it what it will,
And if alive we cannot hold him prisoner,
Why&mdash;death makes all things certain!

Gordon. Butler! What?
Do I understand you? Gracious God! You could&mdash;

Butler. He must not live.

Gordon. And you can do the deed! 20

Butler. Either you or I. This morning was his last.

Gordon. You would assassinate him.

Butler. 'Tis my purpose.

Gordon. Who leans with his whole confidence upon you!

Butler. Such is his evil destiny!

Gordon. Your General!
The sacred person of your General! 25

Butler. My General he has been.

Gordon. That 'tis only
A 'has been' washes out no villainy.
And without judgment passed?

Butler. The execution
Is here instead of judgment.

Gordon. This were murder,
Not justice. The most guilty should be heard. 30

Butler. His guilt is clear, the Emperor has passed judgment,
[773]
And we but execute his will.

Gordon. We should not
Hurry to realize a bloody sentence.
A word may be recalled, a life can never be.

Butler. Dispatch in service pleases sovereigns. 35

Gordon. No honest man's ambitious to press forward
To the hangman's service.

Butler. And no brave man loses
His colour at a daring enterprize.

Gordon. A brave man hazards life, but not his conscience.

Butler. What then? Shall he go forth anew to kindle 40
The unextinguishable flame of war?

Gordon. Seize him, and hold him prisoner&mdash;do not kill him.

Butler. Had not the Emperor's army been defeated,
I might have done so.&mdash;But 'tis now past by.

Gordon. O, wherefore opened I the strong hold to him! 45

Butler. His destiny and not the place destroys him.

Gordon. Upon these ramparts, as beseemed a soldier,
I had fallen, defending the Emperor's citadel!

Butler. Yes! and a thousand gallant men have perished.

Gordon. Doing their duty&mdash;that adorns the man! 50
But murder's a black deed, and nature curses it.

Butler (brings out a paper). Here is the manifesto which commands us
To gain possession of his person. See&mdash;
It is addressed to you as well as me.
Are you content to take the consequences, 55
If through our fault he escape to the enemy?

Gordon. I?&mdash;Gracious God!

Butler. Take it on yourself.
Let come of it what may, on you I lay it.

Gordon. O God in heaven!

Butler. Can you advise aught else
Wherewith to execute the Emperor's purpose? 60
Say if you can. For I desire his fall,
Not his destruction.

Gordon. Merciful heaven! what must be
I see as clear as you. Yet still the heart
Within my bosom beats with other feelings!

Butler. Mine is of harder stuff! Necessity 65
In her rough school hath steeled me. And this Illo
And Tertsky likewise, they must not survive him.

[774]

Gordon. I feel no pang for these. Their own bad hearts
Impelled them, not the influence of the stars.
'Twas they who strewed the seeds of evil passions 70
In his calm breast, and with officious villainy
Watered and nursed the pois'nous plants. May they
Receive their earnests to the uttermost mite!

Butler. And their death shall precede his!
We meant to have taken them alive this evening 75
Amid the merry-making of a feast,
And kept them prisoners in the citadels.
But this makes shorter work. I go this instant
To give the necessary orders.

Scene VII

To these enter Illo and Tertsky.


Tertsky. Our luck is on the turn. To-morrow come
The Swedes&mdash;twelve thousand gallant warriors, Illo!
Then straightways for Vienna. Cheerily, friend!
What! meet such news with such a moody face?

Illo. It lies with us at present to prescribe 5
Laws, and take vengeance on those worthless traitors,
Those skulking cowards that deserted us;
One has already done his bitter penance
The Piccolomini, be his the fate
Of all who wish us evil! This flies sure 10
To the old man's heart; he has his whole life long
Fretted and toiled to raise his ancient house
From a Count's title to the name of Prince;
And now must seek a grave for his only son.

Butler. 'Twas pity though! A youth of such heroic 15
And gentle temperament! The Duke himself,
'Twas easily seen, how near it went to his heart.

Illo. Hark'e, old friend! That is the very point
That never pleased me in our General&mdash;
He ever gave the preference to the Italians. 20
Yea, at this very moment, by my soul!
He'd gladly see us all dead ten times over,
Could he thereby recall his friend to life.

Tertsky. Hush, hush! Let the dead rest! This evening's business
Is, who can fairly drink the other down&mdash; 25
Your regiment, Illo! gives the entertainment.
[775]
Come! we will keep a merry carnival&mdash;
The night for once be day, and mid full glasses
Will we expect the Swedish Avantgarde.

Illo. Yes, let us be of good cheer for to-day, 30
For there's hot work before us, friends! This sword
Shall have no rest, till it be bathed to the hilt
In Austrian blood.

Gordon. Shame, shame! what talk is this,
My Lord Field Marshal? Wherefore foam you so
Against your Emperor?

Butler. Hope not too much 35
From this first victory. Bethink you, sirs!
How rapidly the wheel of Fortune turns;
The Emperor still is formidably strong.

Illo. The Emperor has soldiers, no commander,
For this King Ferdinand of Hungary 40
Is but a tyro. Galas? He's no luck,
And was of old the ruiner of armies.
And then this viper, this Octavio,
Is excellent at stabbing in the back,
But ne'er meets Friedland in the open field. 45

Tertsky. Trust me, my friends, it cannot but succeed;
Fortune, we know, can ne'er forsake the Duke!
And only under Wallenstein can Austria
Be conqueror.

Illo. The Duke will soon assemble
A mighty army, all come crowding, streaming 50
To banners dedicate by destiny
To fame and prosperous fortune. I behold
Old times come back again, he will become
Once more the mighty Lord which he has been.
How will the fools, who've now deserted him, 55
Look then? I can't but laugh to think of them,
For lands will he present to all his friends,
And like a King and Emperor reward
True services; but we've the nearest claims. [To Gordon.
You will not be forgotten, Governor! 60
He'll take you from this nest and bid you shine
In higher station: your fidelity
Well merits it.

Gordon. I am content already,
And wish to climb no higher; where great height is
The fall must needs be great. 'Great height, great depth.' 65


[776]


Illo. Here you have no more business for to-morrow;
The Swedes will take possession of the citadel.
Come, Tertsky, it is supper-time. What think you?
Say, shall we have the State illuminated
In honour of the Swede? And who refuses 70
To do it is a Spaniard and a traitor.

Tertsky. Nay! Nay! not that, it will not please the Duke&mdash;

Illo. What! we are masters here; no soul shall dare
Avow himself imperial where we've rule.
Gordon! Good night, and for the last time, take 75
A fair leave of the place. Send out patroles
To make secure, the watch-word may be altered
At the stroke of ten; deliver in the keys
To the Duke himself, and then you're quit for ever
Your wardship of the gates, for on to-morrow 80
The Swedes will take possession of the citadel.

Tertsky (as he is going, to Butler). You come though to the castle.

Butler. At the right time. [Exeunt Tertsky and Illo.




LINENOTES:

[50] come] comes 1800, 1828, 1829.

Scene VIII

Gordon and Butler.


Gordon (looking after them). Unhappy men! How free from all foreboding!
They rush into the outspread net of murder,
In the blind drunkenness of victory;
I have no pity for their fate. This Illo,
This overflowing and fool-hardy villain 5
That would fain bathe himself in his Emperor's blood.

Butler. Do as he ordered you. Send round patroles.
Take measures for the citadel's security;
When they are within I close the castle gate
That nothing may transpire.

Gordon. Oh! haste not so! 10
Nay, stop; first tell me&mdash;&mdash;

Butler. You have heard already,
To-morrow to the Swedes belongs. This night
Alone is ours. They make good expedition.
But we will make still greater. Fare you well.


[777]


Gordon. Ah! your looks tell me nothing good. Nay, Butler, 15
I pray you, promise me!

Butler. The sun has set;
A fateful evening doth descend upon us,
And brings on their long night! Their evil stars
Deliver them unarmed into our hands.
And from their drunken dream of golden fortunes 20
The dagger at their heart shall rouse them. Well,
The Duke was ever a great calculator;
His fellow-men were figures on his chess-board,
To move and station, as his game required.
Other men's honour, dignity, good name, 25
Did he shift like pawns, and made no conscience of it:
Still calculating, calculating still;
And yet at last his calculation proves
Erroneous; the whole game is lost; and lo!
His own life will be found among the forfeits. 30

Gordon. O think not of his errors now; remember
His greatness, his munificence, think on all
The lovely features of his character,
On all the noble exploits of his life,
And let them, like an angel's arm, unseen 35
Arrest the lifted sword.

Butler. It is too late. 
I suffer not myself to feel compassion,
Dark thoughts and bloody are my duty now: [Grasping Gordon's hand.
Gordon! 'Tis not my hatred (I pretend not
To love the Duke, and have no cause to love him) 40
Yet 'tis not now my hatred that impels me
To be his murderer. 'Tis his evil fate.
Hostile concurrences of many events
Control and subjugate me to the office.
In vain the human being meditates 45
Free action. He is but the wire-worked[777:1] puppet
Of the blind power, which out of his own choice
Creates for him a dread necessity.
What too would it avail him, if there were
[778]
A something pleading for him in my heart&mdash; 50
Still I must kill him.

Gordon. If your heart speak to you,
Follow its impulse. 'Tis the voice of God.
Think you your fortunes will grow prosperous
Bedewed with blood&mdash;his blood? Believe it not!

Butler. You know not. Ask not! Wherefore should it happen, 55
That the Swedes gained the victory, and hasten
With such forced marches hitherward? Fain would I
Have given him to the Emperor's mercy.&mdash;Gordon!
I do not wish his blood&mdash;But I must ransom
The honour of my word&mdash;it lies in pledge&mdash; 60
And he must die, or&mdash;&mdash; [Passionately grasping Gordon's hand.
Listen then, and know!
I am dishonoured if the Duke escape us.

Gordon. O! to save such a man&mdash;&mdash;

Butler. What!

Gordon. It is worth
A sacrifice.&mdash;Come, friend! Be noble-minded!
Our own heart, and not other men's opinions, 65
Forms our true honour.

Butler. He is a great Lord,
This Duke&mdash;and I am but of mean importance.
This is what you would say? Wherein concerns it
The world at large, you mean to hint to me,
Whether the man of low extraction keeps 70
Or blemishes his honour&mdash;
So that the man of princely rank be saved.
We all do stamp our value on ourselves.
The price we challenge for ourselves is given us.
There does not live on earth the man so stationed, 75
That I despise myself compared with him.
Man is made great or little by his own will;
Because I am true to mine, therefore he dies.

Gordon. I am endeavouring to move a rock.
Thou hadst a mother, yet no human feelings. 80
I cannot hinder you, but may some God
Rescue him from you! [Exit Gordon.

Butler (alone). I treasured my good name all my life long;
The Duke has cheated me of life's best jewel,
So that I blush before this poor weak Gordon!
He prizes above all his fealty;
His conscious soul accuses him of nothing; 5
In opposition to his own soft heart
He subjugates himself to an iron duty.
Me in a weaker moment passion warped;
I stand beside him, and must feel myself
The worst man of the two. What though the world 10
Is ignorant of my purposed treason, yet
One man does know it, and can prove it too&mdash;

There lives the man who can dishonour me!

ACT IV


Scene I

Scene&mdash;Butler's Chamber.

Butler, and Major Geraldin.


Butler. Find me twelve strong dragoons, arm them with pikes,
For there must be no firing&mdash;&mdash;
Conceal them somewhere near the banquet-room,
And soon as the dessert is served up, rush all in
And cry&mdash;Who is loyal to the Emperor? 5
I will overturn the table&mdash;while you attack
Illo and Tertsky, and dispatch them both.
The castle-palace is well barred and guarded,
That no intelligence of this proceeding
May make its way to the Duke.&mdash;Go instantly; 10
Have you yet sent for Captain Devereux
And the Macdonald?&mdash;&mdash;

Geraldin. They'll be here anon. [Exit Geraldin.


[780]


Butler. Here's no room for delay. The citizens
Declare for him, a dizzy drunken spirit
Possesses the whole town. They see in the Duke 15
A Prince of peace, a founder of new ages
And golden times. Arms too have been given out
By the town-council, and a hundred citizens
Have volunteered themselves to stand on guard.
Dispatch then be the word. For enemies 20
Threaten us from without and from within.




Scene II

Butler, Captain Devereux, and Macdonald.


Macdonald. Here we are, General.

Devereux. What's to be the watchword?

Butler. Long live the Emperor!

Both (recoiling). How?

Butler. Live the House of Austria!

Devereux. Have we not sworn fidelity to Friedland?

Macdonald. Have we not marched to this place to protect him?

Butler. Protect a traitor, and his country's enemy! 5

Devereux. Why, yes! in his name you administered
Our oath.

Macdonald. And followed him yourself to Egra.

Butler. I did it the more surely to destroy him.

Devereux. So then!

Macdonald. An altered case!

Butler (to Devereux). Thou wretched man!
So easily leav'st thou thy oath and colours? 10

Devereux. The devil!&mdash;I but followed your example,
If you could prove a villain, why not we?

Macdonald. We've nought to do with thinking&mdash;that's your business.
You are our General, and give out the orders;
We follow you, though the track lead to hell. 15

Butler. Good then! we know each other.

Macdonald. I should hope so.

Devereux. Soldiers of fortune are we&mdash;who bids most,
He has us.

Macdonald. 'Tis e'en so!

Butler. Well, for the present
Ye must remain honest and faithful soldiers.


[781]


Devereux. We wish no other.

Butler. Ay, and make your fortunes. 20

Macdonald. That is still better.

Butler. Listen!

Both. We attend.

Butler. It is the Emperor's will and ordinance
To seize the person of the Prince-Duke Friedland,
Alive or dead.

Devereux. It runs so in the letter.

Macdonald. Alive or dead&mdash;these were the very words. 25

Butler. And he shall be rewarded from the State
In land and gold, who proffers aid thereto.

Devereux. Ay? That sounds well. The words sound always well
That travel hither from the Court. Yes! yes!
We know already what Court-words import. 30
A golden chain perhaps in sign of favour,
Or an old charger, or a parchment patent,
And such like.&mdash;The Prince-duke pays better.

Macdonald. Yes,
The Duke's a splendid paymaster.

Butler. All over
With that, my friends! His lucky stars are set. 35

Macdonald. And is that certain?

Butler. You have my word for it.

Devereux. His lucky fortunes all past by?

Butler. For ever.
He is as poor as we.

Macdonald. As poor as we?

Devereux. Macdonald, we'll desert him.

Butler. We'll desert him?
Full twenty thousand have done that already; 40
We must do more, my countrymen! In short&mdash;
We&mdash;we must kill him.

Both. Kill him!

Butler. Yes! must kill him.
And for that purpose have I chosen you.

Both. Us!

Butler. You, Captain Devereux, and thee, Macdonald. 45

Devereux (after a pause). Choose you some other.

Butler. What? art dastardly?
Thou, with full thirty lives to answer for&mdash;
[782]
Thou conscientious of a sudden?

Devereux. Nay,
To assassinate our Lord and General&mdash;

Macdonald. To whom we've sworn a soldier's oath&mdash;

Butler. The oath 50
Is null, for Friedland is a traitor.

Devereux. No, no! It is too bad!

Macdonald. Yes, by my soul!
It is too bad. One has a conscience too&mdash;

Devereux. If it were not our chieftain, who so long
Has issued the commands, and claim'd our duty. 55

Butler. Is that the objection?

Devereux. Were it my own father,
And the Emperor's service should demand it of me,
It might be done perhaps&mdash;But we are soldiers,
And to assassinate our chief commander,
That is a sin, a foul abomination, 60
From which no monk or confessor absolves us.

Butler. I am your Pope, and give you absolution.
Determine quickly!

Devereux. 'Twill not do!

Macdonald. 'Twon't do!

Butler. Well, off then! and&mdash;send Pestalutz to me.

Devereux. The Pestalutz&mdash;

Macdonald. What may you want with him? 65

Butler. If you reject it, we can find enough&mdash;

Devereux. Nay, if he must fall, we may earn the bounty
As well as any other. What think you,
Brother Macdonald?

Macdonald. Why if he must fall,
And will fall, and it can't be otherwise, 70
One would not give place to this Pestalutz.

Devereux. When do you purpose he should fall?

Butler. This night.
To-morrow will the Swedes be at our gates.

Devereux. You take upon you all the consequences!

Butler. I take the whole upon me.

Devereux. And it is 75
The Emperor's will, his express absolute will?
For we have instances, that folks may like
The murder, and yet hang the murderer.


[783]


Butler. The manifesto says&mdash;alive or dead.
Alive&mdash;'tis not possible&mdash;you see it is not. 80

Devereux. Well, dead then! dead! But how can we come at him?
The town is fill'd with Tertsky's soldiery.

Macdonald. Ay! and then Tertsky still remains, and Illo&mdash;

Butler. With these you shall begin&mdash;you understand me?

Devereux. How? And must they too perish?

Butler. They the first. 85

Macdonald. Hear, Devereux? A bloody evening this.

Devereux. Have you a man for that? Commission me&mdash;

Butler. 'Tis given in trust to Major Geraldin;
This is a carnival night, and there's a feast
Given at the castle&mdash;there we shall surprise them, 90
And hew them down. The Pestalutz and Lesley
Have that commission&mdash;soon as that is finished&mdash;

Devereux. Hear, General! It will be all one to you.
Hark'e! let me exchange with Geraldin.

Butler. 'Twill be the lesser danger with the Duke. 95

Devereux. Danger! The devil! What do you think me, General?
'Tis the Duke's eye, and not his sword, I fear.

Butler. What can his eye do to thee?

Devereux. Death and hell!
Thou know'st that I'm no milk-sop, General!
But 'tis not eight days since the Duke did send me 100
Twenty gold pieces for this good warm coat
Which I have on! and then for him to see me
Standing before him with the pike, his murderer,
That eye of his looking upon this coat&mdash;
Why&mdash;why&mdash;the devil fetch me! I'm no milk-sop! 105

Butler. The Duke presented thee this good warm coat,
And thou, a needy wight, hast pangs of conscience
To run him through the body in return.
A coat that is far better and far warmer
Did the Emperor give to him, the Prince's mantle. 110
How doth he thank the Emperor? With revolt,
And treason.

Devereux. That is true. The devil take
Such thankers! I'll dispatch him.

Butler. And would'st quiet
Thy conscience, thou hast nought to do but simply
Pull off the coat; so canst thou do the deed 115
[784]
With light heart and good spirits.

Devereux. You are right.
That did not strike me. I'll pull off the coat&mdash;
So there's an end of it.

Macdonald. Yes, but there's another
Point to be thought of.

Butler. And what's that, Macdonald?

Macdonald. What avails sword or dagger against him? 120
He is not to be wounded&mdash;he is&mdash;

Butler. What?

Macdonald. Safe against shot, and stab and flash! Hard frozen,
Secured, and warranted by the black art!
His body is impenetrable, I tell you.

Devereux. In Inglestadt there was just such another&mdash; 125
His whole skin was the same as steel; at last
We were obliged to beat him down with gunstocks.

Macdonald. Hear what I'll do.

Devereux. Well?

Macdonald. In the cloister here
There's a Dominican, my countryman.
I'll make him dip my sword and pike for me 130
In holy water, and say over them
One of his strongest blessings. That's probatum!
Nothing can stand 'gainst that.

Butler. So do, Macdonald!
But now go and select from out the regiment
Twenty or thirty able-bodied fellows, 135
And let them take the oaths to the Emperor.
Then when it strikes eleven, when the first rounds
Are passed, conduct them silently as may be
To the house&mdash;I will myself be not far off.

Devereux. But how do we get through Hartschier and Gordon, 140
That stand on guard there in the inner chamber?

Butler. I have made myself acquainted with the place.
I lead you through a back-door that's defended
By one man only. Me my rank and office
Give access to the Duke at every hour. 145
I'll go before you&mdash;with one poniard-stroke
Cut Hartschier's wind-pipe, and make way for you.

Devereux. And when we are there, by what means shall we gain
[785]
The Duke's bed-chamber, without his alarming
The servants of the Court; for he has here 150
A numerous company of followers?

Butler. The attendants fill the right wing; he hates bustle,
And lodges in the left wing quite alone.

Devereux. Were it well over&mdash;hey, Macdonald? I
Feel queerly on the occasion, devil knows! 155

Macdonald. And I too. 'Tis too great a personage.
People will hold us for a brace of villains.

Butler. In plenty, honour, splendour&mdash;You may safely
Laugh at the people's babble.

Devereux. If the business
Squares with one's honour&mdash;if that be quite certain&mdash; 160

Butler. Set your hearts quite at ease. Ye save for Ferdinand
His Crown and Empire. The reward can be
No small one.

Devereux. And 'tis his purpose to dethrone the Emperor?

Butler. Yes!&mdash;Yes!&mdash;to rob him of his crown and life. 165

Devereux. And he must fall by the executioner's hands,
Should we deliver him up to the Emperor
Alive?

Butler. It were his certain destiny.

Devereux. Well! Well! Come then, Macdonald, he shall not
Lie long in pain. 170


[Exeunt Butler through one door, Macdonald and Devereux through the
other.

Scene III

Scene&mdash;A Gothic Apartment at the Duchess Friedland's. Thekla on a seat,
pale, her eyes closed. The Duchess and Lady Neubrunn busied about her.
Wallenstein and the Countess in conversation.


Wallenstein. How knew she it so soon?

Countess. She seems to have
Foreboded some misfortune. The report
Of an engagement, in the which had fallen
A colonel of the Imperial army, frighten'd her.
I saw it instantly. She flew to meet 5
The Swedish Courier, and with sudden questioning,
Soon wrested from him the disastrous secret.
Too late we missed her, hastened after her,
[786]
We found her lying in his arms, all pale
And in a swoon.

Wallenstein. A heavy, heavy blow! 10
And she so unprepared! Poor child! How is it? [Turning to the Duchess.
Is she coming to herself?

Duchess. Her eyes are opening.

Countess. She lives.

Thekla (looking around her). Where am I?

Wallenstein (steps to her, raising her up in his arms). Come, cheerly, Thekla! be my own brave girl!
See, there's thy loving mother. Thou art in 15
Thy father's arms.

Thekla (standing up). Where is he? Is he gone?

Duchess. Who gone, my daughter?

Thekla. He&mdash;the man who uttered
That word of misery.

Duchess. O! think not of it,
My Thekla!

Wallenstein. Give her sorrow leave to talk!
Let her complain&mdash;mingle your tears with hers, 20
For she hath suffered a deep anguish; but
She'll rise superior to it, for my Thekla
Hath all her father's unsubdued heart.

Thekla. I am not ill. See, I have power to stand.
Why does my mother weep? Have I alarmed her? 25
It is gone by&mdash;I recollect myself&mdash; [She casts her eyes round the room, as seeking some one.
Where is he? Please you, do not hide him from me.
You see I have strength enough: now I will hear him.

Duchess. No, never shall this messenger of evil
Enter again into thy presence, Thekla! 30

Thekla. My father&mdash;

Wallenstein. Dearest daughter!

Thekla. I'm not weak&mdash;
Shortly I shall be quite myself again.
You'll grant me one request?

Wallenstein. Name it, my daughter.

Thekla. Permit the stranger to be called to me,
And grant me leave, that by myself I may 35
Hear his report and question him.

Duchess. No, never!

Countess. 'Tis not advisable&mdash;assent not to it.


[787]


Wallenstein. Hush! Wherefore would'st thou speak with him, my daughter?

Thekla. Knowing the whole, I shall be more collected;
I will not be deceived. My mother wishes 40
Only to spare me. I will not be spared.
The worst is said already: I can hear
Nothing of deeper anguish!

Countess and Duchess. Do it not.

Thekla. The horror overpowered me by surprise.
My heart betrayed me in the stranger's presence; 45
He was a witness of my weakness, yea,
I sank into his arms; and that has shamed me.
I must replace myself in his esteem,
And I must speak with him, perforce, that he,
The stranger, may not think ungently of me. 50

Wallenstein. I see she is in the right, and am inclined
To grant her this request of hers. Go, call him. [Lady Neubrunn goes to call him.

Duchess. But I, thy mother, will be present&mdash;

Thekla. 'Twere
More pleasing to me, if alone I saw him:
Trust me, I shall behave myself the more 55
Collectedly.

Wallenstein. Permit her her own will.
Leave her alone with him: for there are sorrows,
Where of necessity the soul must be
Its own support. A strong heart will rely
On its own strength alone. In her own bosom, 60
Not in her mother's arms, must she collect
The strength to rise superior to this blow.
It is mine own brave girl. I'll have her treated
Not as the woman, but the heroine. [Going.

Countess (detaining him). Where art thou going? I heard Tertsky say 65
That 'tis thy purpose to depart from hence
To-morrow early, but to leave us here.

Wallenstein. Yes, ye stay here, placed under the protection
Of gallant men.

Countess. O take us with you, brother.
Leave us not in this gloomy solitude 70
To brood o'er anxious thoughts. The mists of doubt
[788]
Magnify evils to a shape of horror.

Wallenstein. Who speaks of evil? I entreat you, sister,
Use words of better omen.

Countess. Then take us with you.
O leave us not behind you in a place 75
That forces us to such sad omens. Heavy
And sick within me is my heart&mdash;&mdash;
These walls breathe on me, like a church-yard vault.
I cannot tell you, brother, how this place
Doth go against my nature. Take us with you. 80
Come, sister, join you your entreaty!&mdash;Niece,
Yours too. We all entreat you, take us with you!

Wallenstein. The place's evil omens will I change,
Making it that which shields and shelters for me
My best beloved.

Lady Neubrunn (returning). The Swedish officer. 85

Wallenstein. Leave her alone with him. [Exit.

Duchess (to Thekla who starts and shivers). There&mdash;pale as death!&mdash;Child, 'tis impossible
That thou should'st speak with him. Follow thy mother.

Thekla. The Lady Neubrunn then may stay with me. [Exeunt Duchess and Countess.

Scene IV

Thekla, the Swedish Captain, Lady Neubrunn.


Captain. Princess&mdash;I must entreat your gentle pardon&mdash;
My inconsiderate rash speech&mdash;How could I&mdash;

Thekla. You did behold me in my agony.
A most distressful accident occasioned
You from a stranger to become at once 5
My confidant.

Captain. I fear you hate my presence,
For my tongue spake a melancholy word.

Thekla. The fault is mine. Myself did wrest it from you.
The horror which came o'er me interrupted
Your tale at its commencement. May it please you, 10
Continue it to the end.

Captain. Princess, 'twill
Renew your anguish.

Thekla. I am firm.&mdash;&mdash;
[789]
I will be firm. Well&mdash;how began the engagement?

Captain. We lay, expecting no attack, at Neustadt,
Entrenched but insecurely in our camp, 15
When towards evening rose a cloud of dust
From the wood thitherward; our vanguard fled
Into the camp, and sounded the alarm.
Scarce had we mounted, ere the Pappenheimers,
Their horses at full speed, broke through the lines, 20
And leapt the trenches; but their heedless courage
Had borne them onward far before the others&mdash;
The infantry were still at distance, only
The Pappenheimers followed daringly
Their daring leader&mdash;&mdash;


[Thekla betrays agitation in her gestures. The officer pauses till she
makes a sign to him to proceed.


Captain. Both in van and flanks 25
With our whole cavalry we now received them;
Back to the trenches drove them, where the foot
Stretched out a solid ridge of pikes to meet them.
They neither could advance, nor yet retreat;
And as they stood on every side wedged in, 30
The Rhinegrave to their leader called aloud,
Inviting a surrender; but their leader,
Young Piccolomini&mdash;&mdash; [Thekla, as giddy, grasps a chair.
Known by his plume,
And his long hair, gave signal for the trenches;
Himself leapt first, the regiment all plunged after. 35
His charger, by a halbert gored, reared up,
Flung him with violence off, and over him
The horses, now no longer to be curbed,&mdash;&mdash;


[Thekla, who has accompanied the last speech with all the marks of
increasing agony, trembles through her whole frame, and is falling. The
Lady Neubrunn runs to her, and receives her in her arms.


Neubrunn. My dearest lady&mdash;&mdash;

Captain. I retire.

Thekla. 'Tis over.
Proceed to the conclusion.

Captain. Wild despair 40
Inspired the troops with frenzy when they saw
Their leader perish; every thought of rescue
[790]
Was spurn'd; they fought like wounded tigers; their
Frantic resistance rous'd our soldiery;
A murderous fight took place, nor was the contest 45
Finish'd before their last man fell.

Thekla. And where&mdash;&mdash;
Where is&mdash;You have not told me all.

Captain (after a pause). This morning
We buried him. Twelve youths of noblest birth
Did bear him to interment; the whole army
Followed the bier. A laurel decked his coffin; 50
The sword of the deceased was placed upon it,
In mark of honour, by the Rhinegrave's self.
Nor tears were wanting; for there are among us
Many, who had themselves experienced
The greatness of his mind, and gentle manners; 55
All were affected at his fate. The Rhinegrave
Would willingly have saved him; but himself
Made vain the attempt&mdash;'tis said he wished to die.

Neubrunn (to Thekla who has hidden her countenance). Look up,
my dearest lady&mdash;&mdash;

Thekla. Where is his grave?

Captain. At Neustadt, lady; in a cloister church 60
Are his remains deposited, until
We can receive directions from his father.

Thekla. What is the cloister's name?

Captain. Saint Catharine's.

Thekla. And how far is it thither?

Captain. Near twelve leagues.

Thekla. And which the way?

Captain. You go by Tirschenreit 65
And Falkenberg, through our advanced posts.

Thekla. Who
Is their commander?

Captain. Colonel Seckendorf.


[Thekla steps to the table, and takes a ring from a casket.


Thekla. You have beheld me in my agony,
And shewn a feeling heart. Please you, accept [Giving him the ring.
A small memorial of this hour. Now go! 70

Captain. Princess&mdash;&mdash;


[Thekla silently makes signs to him to go, and turns from him. The
Captain lingers, and is about to speak. Lady Neubrunn repeats the
signal, and he retires.

Thekla, Lady Neubrunn.


Thekla (falls on Lady Neubrunn's neck). Now, gentle Neubrunn, shew me the affection
Which thou hast ever promised&mdash;prove thyself
My own true friend and faithful fellow-pilgrim.
This night we must away!

Neubrunn. Away! and whither?

Thekla. Whither! There is but one place in the world. 5
Thither where he lies buried! To his coffin!

Neubrunn. What would you do there?

Thekla. What do there?
That would'st thou not have asked, hadst thou e'er loved.
There, there is all that still remains of him.
That single spot is the whole earth to me. 10

Neubrunn. That place of death&mdash;&mdash;

Thekla. Is now the only place,
Where life yet dwells for me: detain me not!
Come and make preparations: let us think
Of means to fly from hence.

Neubrunn. Your father's rage&mdash;&mdash;

Thekla. That time is past&mdash;&mdash; 15
And now I fear no human being's rage.

Neubrunn. The sentence of the world! The tongue of calumny!

Thekla. Whom am I seeking? Him who is no more.
Am I then hastening to the arms&mdash;&mdash;O God!
I haste but to the grave of the beloved. 20

Neubrunn. And we alone, two helpless feeble women?

Thekla. We will take weapons: my arms shall protect thee.

Neubrunn. In the dark night-time?

Thekla. Darkness will conceal us.

Neubrunn. This rough tempestuous night&mdash;&mdash;

Thekla. Had he a soft bed
Under the hoofs of his war-horses?

Neubrunn. Heaven! 25
And then the many posts of the enemy!&mdash;

Thekla. They are human beings. Misery travels free
Through the whole earth.

Neubrunn. The journey's weary length&mdash;

Thekla. The pilgrim, travelling to a distant shrine
Of hope and healing, doth not count the leagues. 30


[792]


Neubrunn. How can we pass the gates?

Thekla. Gold opens them.
Go, do but go.

Neubrunn. Should we be recognized&mdash;

Thekla. In a despairing woman, a poor fugitive,
Will no one seek the daughter of Duke Friedland.

Neubrunn. And where procure we horses for our flight? 35

Thekla. My equerry procures them. Go and fetch him.

Neubrunn. Dares he, without the knowledge of his lord?

Thekla. He will. Go, only go. Delay no longer.

Neubrunn. Dear lady! and your mother?

Thekla. Oh! my mother!

Neubrunn. So much as she has suffered too already; 40
Your tender mother&mdash;Ah! how ill prepared
For this last anguish!

Thekla. Woe is me! my mother! [Pauses.
Go instantly.

Neubrunn. But think what you are doing!

Thekla. What can be thought, already has been thought.

Neubrunn. And being there, what purpose you to do? 45

Thekla. There a divinity will prompt my soul.

Neubrunn. Your heart, dear lady, is disquieted!
And this is not the way that leads to quiet.

Thekla. To a deep quiet, such as he has found.
It draws me on, I know not what to name it, 50
Resistless does it draw me to his grave.
There will my heart be eased, my tears will flow.
O hasten, make no further questioning!
There is no rest for me till I have left
These walls&mdash;they fall in on me&mdash;A dim power 55
Drives me from hence&mdash;Oh mercy! What a feeling!
What pale and hollow forms are those! They fill,
They crowd the place! I have no longer room here!
Mercy! Still more! More still! The hideous swarm!
They press on me; they chase me from these walls&mdash; 60
Those hollow, bodiless forms of living men!

Neubrunn. You frighten me so, lady, that no longer
I dare stay here myself. I go and call
Rosenberg instantly. [Exit Lady Neubrunn.

Forsake their leader even in his death&mdash;they died for him! 5

ACT V

Scene I

Scene&mdash;A Saloon, terminated by a gallery which extends far into the
back-ground. Wallenstein sitting at a table. The Swedish Captain
standing before him.


Wallenstein. Commend me to your lord. I sympathize
In his good fortune; and if you have seen me
Deficient in the expressions of that joy
Which such a victory might well demand,
Attribute it to no lack of good will, 5
For henceforth are our fortunes one. Farewell,
And for your trouble take my thanks. To-morrow
The citadel shall be surrendered to you
On your arrival.


[The Swedish Captain retires. Wallenstein sits lost in thought, his
eyes fixed vacantly, and his head sustained by his hand. The Countess
Tertsky [794]enters, stands before him awhile, unobserved by him; at length
he starts, sees her, and recollects himself.


Wallenstein. Com'st thou from her? Is she restored? How is she? 10

Countess. My sister tells me, she was more collected
After her conversation with the Swede.
She has now retired to rest.

Wallenstein. The pang will soften,
She will shed tears.

Countess. I find thee altered too,
My brother! After such a victory 15
I had expected to have found in thee
A cheerful spirit. O remain thou firm!
Sustain, uphold us! For our light thou art,
Our sun.

Wallenstein. Be quiet. I ail nothing. Where's
Thy husband?

Countess. At a banquet&mdash;he and Illo. 20

Wallenstein (rises). The night's far spent. Betake thee to thy chamber.

Countess. Bid me not go, O let me stay with thee!

Wallenstein (moves to the window). There is a busy motion in the Heaven,
The wind doth chase the flag upon the tower,
Fast sweep the clouds, the sickle[794:1] of the moon, 25
Struggling, darts snatches of uncertain light.
No form of star is visible! That one
[795]
White stain of light, that single glimmering yonder,
Is from Cassiopeia, and therein
Is Jupiter. (A pause.) But now 30
The blackness of the troubled element hides him!

[He sinks into profound melancholy, and looks vacantly into the
distance.


Countess (looks on him mournfully, then grasps his hand).
What art thou brooding on?

Wallenstein. Methinks,
If I but saw him, 'twould be well with me.
He, is the star of my nativity,
And often marvellously hath his aspect 35
Shot strength into my heart.

Countess. Thou'lt see him again.

Wallenstein. See him again? O never, never again.

Countess. How?

Wallenstein. He is gone&mdash;is dust.

Countess. Whom meanest thou then?

Wallenstein. He, the more fortunate! yea, he hath finished!
For him there is no longer any future, 40
His life is bright&mdash;bright without spot it was,
And cannot cease to be. No ominous hour
Knocks at his door with tidings of mishap.
Far off is he, above desire and fear;
No more submitted to the change and chance 45
Of the unsteady planets. O 'tis well
With him! but who knows what the coming hour
Veil'd in thick darkness brings for us!

Countess. Thou speakest
Of Piccolomini. What was his death?
The courier had just left thee as I came. 50
[Wallenstein by a motion of his hand makes signs to her to be silent.
Turn not thine eyes upon the backward view,
Let us look forward into sunny days,
Welcome with joyous heart the victory,
Forget what it has cost thee. Not to-day,
For the first time, thy friend was to thee dead; 55
To thee he died, when first he parted from thee.


[796]


Wallenstein. I shall grieve down this blow, of that I'm conscious.
What does not man grieve down? From the highest,
As from the vilest thing of every day
He learns to wean himself: for the strong hours 60
Conquer him. Yet I feel what I have lost
In him. The bloom is vanished from my life.
For O! he stood beside me, like my youth,
Transformed for me the real to a dream,
Clothing the palpable and familiar 65
With golden exhalations of the dawn.
Whatever fortunes wait my future toils,
The beautiful is vanished&mdash;and returns not.

Countess. O be not treacherous to thy own power.
Thy heart is rich enough to vivify 70
Itself. Thou lov'st and prizest virtues in him,
The which thyself did'st plant, thyself unfold.

Wallenstein (stepping to the door). Who interrupts us now at this late hour?
It is the Governor. He brings the keys
Of the Citadel. 'Tis midnight. Leave me, sister! 75

Countess. O 'tis so hard to me this night to leave thee&mdash;
A boding fear possesses me!

Wallenstein. Fear? Wherefore?

Countess. Should'st thou depart this night, and we at waking
Never more find thee!

Wallenstein. Fancies!

Countess. O my soul
Has long been weighed down by these dark forebodings. 80
And if I combat and repel them waking,
They still rush down upon my heart in dreams,
I saw thee yesternight with thy first wife
Sit at a banquet gorgeously attired.


[797]


Wallenstein. This was a dream of favourable omen, 85
That marriage being the founder of my fortunes.

Countess. To-day I dreamt that I was seeking thee
In thy own chamber. As I entered, lo!
It was no more a chamber; the Chartreuse
At Gitschin 'twas, which thou thyself hast founded, 90
And where it is thy will that thou should'st be
Interred.

Wallenstein. Thy soul is busy with these thoughts.

Countess. What dost thou not believe that oft in dreams
A voice of warning speaks prophetic to us?

Wallenstein. There is no doubt that there exist such voices. 95
Yet I would not call them
Voices of warning that announce to us
Only the inevitable. As the sun,
Ere it is risen, sometimes paints its image
In the atmosphere, so often do the spirits 100
Of great events stride on before the events,
And in to-day already walks to-morrow.
That which we read of the fourth Henry's death
Did ever vex and haunt me like a tale
Of my own future destiny. The King 105
Felt in his breast the phantom of the knife,
Long ere Ravaillac arm'd himself therewith.
His quiet mind forsook him: the phantasma
Started him in his Louvre, chased him forth
Into the open air: like funeral knells 110
Sounded that coronation festival;
And still with boding sense he heard the tread
Of those feet that ev'n then were seeking him
Throughout the streets of Paris.

Countess. And to thee
The voice within thy soul bodes nothing?

Wallenstein. Nothing. 115
Be wholly tranquil.

Countess. And another time
I hastened after thee, and thou ran'st from me
Through a long suite, through many a spacious hall,
There seemed no end of it: doors creaked and clapped;
I followed panting, but could not o'ertake thee; 120
When on a sudden did I feel myself
Grasped from behind&mdash;the hand was cold that grasped me&mdash;
'Twas thou, and thou did'st kiss me, and there seemed
[798]
A crimson covering to envelop us.

Wallenstein. That is the crimson tapestry of my chamber. 125

Countess (gazing on him). If it should come to that&mdash;if I should see thee,
Who standest now before me in the fulness
Of life&mdash; [She falls on his breast and weeps.

Wallenstein. The Emperor's proclamation weighs upon thee&mdash;
Alphabets wound not&mdash;and he finds no hands. 130

Countess. If he should find them, my resolve is taken&mdash;
I bear about me my support and refuge. [Exit Countess.




FOOTNOTES:

[794:1] These four lines are expressed in the original with
exquisite felicity.


'Am Himmel ist gesch&auml;ftige Bewegung,
Des Thurmes Fahne jagt der Wind, schnell geht
Der Wolken Zug, die Mondessichel wankt,
Und durch die Nacht zeucht ungewisse Helle.'


The word 'moon-sickle' reminds me of a passage in Harris, as quoted by
Johnson, under the word 'falcated'. 'The enlightened part of the moon
appears in the form of a sickle or reaping-hook, which is while she is
moving from the conjunction to the opposition, or from the new moon to
the full: but from full to a new again, the enlightened part appears
gibbous, and the dark falcated.'

The words 'wanken' and 'schweben' are not easily translated. The English

Scene II

Wallenstein, Gordon.


Wallenstein. All quiet in the town?

Gordon. The town is quiet.

Wallenstein. I hear a boisterous music! and the Castle
Is lighted up. Who are the revellers?

Gordon. There is a banquet given at the Castle
To the Count Tertsky, and Field Marshal Illo. 5

Wallenstein. In honour of the victory.&mdash;This tribe
Can shew their joy in nothing else but feasting.
[Rings. The Groom of the Chamber enters.
Unrobe me. I will lay me down to sleep.
[Wallenstein takes the keys from Gordon.
So we are guarded from all enemies,
And shut in with sure friends. 10
For all must cheat me, or a face like this [Fixing his eye on Gordon.
Was ne'er a hypocrite's mask.


[The Groom of the Chamber takes off his mantle, collar and scarf.


Wallenstein. Take care&mdash;what is that?

Groom of the Chamber. The golden chain is snapped in two.

Wallenstein. Well, it has lasted long enough. Here&mdash;give it.
[He takes and looks at the chain.
'Twas the first present of the Emperor. 15
He hung it round me in the war of Friule,
He being then Archduke; and I have worn it
Till now from habit&mdash;&mdash;
From superstition if you will. Belike,
It was to be a talisman to me, 20
[799]
And while I wore it on my neck in faith,
It was to chain to me all my life long
The volatile fortune whose first pledge it was.
Well, be it so! Henceforward a new fortune
Must spring up for me; for the potency 25
Of this charm is dissolved.


[Groom of the Chamber retires with the vestments. Wallenstein rises,
takes a stride across the room, and stands at last before Gordon in a
posture of meditation.


How the old time returns upon me! I
Behold myself once more at Burgau, where
We two were pages of the Court together.
We oftentimes disputed: thy intention 30
Was ever good; but thou wert wont to play
The moralist and preacher, and would'st rail at me
That I strove after things too high for me,
Giving my faith to bold unlawful dreams,
And still extol to me the golden mean. 35
&mdash;Thy wisdom hath been proved a thriftless friend
To thy own self. See, it has made thee early
A superannuated man, and (but
That my munificent stars will intervene)
Would let thee in some miserable corner 40
Go out like an untended lamp.

Gordon. My Prince!
With light heart the poor fisher moors his boat,
And watches from the shore the lofty ship
Stranded amid the storm.

Wallenstein. Art thou already
In harbour then, old man? Well! I am not. 45
The unconquered spirit drives me o'er life's billows;
My planks still firm, my canvas swelling proudly.
Hope is my goddess still, and youth my inmate;
And while we stand thus front to front almost,
I might presume to say, that the swift years 50
Have passed by powerless o'er my unblanched hair.

[He moves with long strides across the saloon, and remains on the
opposite side over against Gordon.

Who now persists in calling Fortune false?
To me she has proved faithful, with fond love
Took me from out the common ranks of men,
And like a mother goddess, with strong arm 55
Carried me swiftly up the steps of life.
[800]
Nothing is common in my destiny,
Nor in the furrows of my hand. Who dares
Interpret then my life for me as 'twere
One of the undistinguishable many? 60
True in this present moment I appear
Fallen low indeed; but I shall rise again.
The high flood will soon follow on this ebb;
The fountain of my fortune, which now stops
Repressed and bound by some malicious star, 65
Will soon in joy play forth from all its pipes.

Gordon. And yet remember I the good old proverb,
'Let the night come before we praise the day.'
I would be slow from long-continued fortune
To gather hope: for hope is the companion 70
Given to the unfortunate by pitying Heaven.
Fear hovers round the head of prosperous men,
For still unsteady are the scales of fate.

Wallenstein (smiling). I hear the very Gordon that of old
Was wont to preach to me, now once more preaching; 75
I know well, that all sublunary things
Are still the vassals of vicissitude.
The unpropitious gods demand their tribute.
This long ago the ancient Pagans knew:
And therefore of their own accord they offered 80
To themselves injuries, so to atone
The jealousy of their divinities:
And human sacrifices bled to Typhon. [After a pause, serious, and in a more subdued manner.
I too have sacrific'd to him&mdash;For me
There fell the dearest friend, and through my fault 85
He fell! No joy from favourable fortune
Can overweigh the anguish of this stroke.
The envy of my destiny is glutted:
Life pays for life. On his pure head the lightning
Was drawn off which would else have shattered me. 90




Scene III

To these enter Seni.


Wallenstein. Is not that Seni? and beside himself,
If one may trust his looks! What brings thee hither
At this late hour, Baptista?

Seni. Terror, Duke!
[801]
On thy account.

Wallenstein. What now?

Seni. Flee ere the day-break!
Trust not thy person to the Swedes!

Wallenstein. What now 5
Is in thy thoughts?

Seni (with louder voice). Trust not thy person to these Swedes.

Wallenstein. What is it then?

Seni (still more urgently). O wait not the arrival of these Swedes!
An evil near at hand is threatening thee
From false friends. All the signs stand full of horror! 10
Near, near at hand the net-work of perdition&mdash;
Yea, even now 'tis being cast around thee!

Wallenstein. Baptista, thou art dreaming!&mdash;Fear befools thee.

Seni. Believe not that an empty fear deludes me.
Come, read it in the planetary aspects; 15
Read it thyself, that ruin threatens thee
From false friends!

Wallenstein. From the falseness of my friends
Has risen the whole of my unprosperous fortunes.
The warning should have come before! At present
I need no revelation from the stars 20
To know that.

Seni. Come and see! trust thine own eyes!
A fearful sign stands in the house of life;
An enemy, a fiend lurks close behind
The radiance of thy planet&mdash;O be warned!
Deliver not thyself up to these heathens 25
To wage a war against our holy church.

Wallenstein (laughing gently). The oracle rails that way! Yes, yes! Now
I recollect. This junction with the Swedes
Did never please thee&mdash;lay thyself to sleep,
Baptista! Signs like these I do not fear. 30

Gordon (who during the whole of this dialogue has shewn marks of extreme agitation, and now turns to Wallenstein). My Duke and General! May I dare presume?

Wallenstein. Speak freely.

Gordon. What if 'twere no mere creation
Of fear, if God's high providence vouchsaf'd
To interpose its aid for your deliverance,
And made that mouth its organ.


[802]


Wallenstein. Ye're both feverish! 35
How can mishap come to me from the Swedes?
They sought this junction with me&mdash;'tis their interest.

Gordon (with difficulty suppressing his emotion). But what if the arrival of these Swedes&mdash;
What if this were the very thing that winged
The ruin that is flying to your temples? 40
[Flings himself at his feet.
There is yet time, my Prince.

Seni. O hear him! hear him!

Gordon (rises). The Rhinegrave's still far off. Give but the orders,
This citadel shall close its gates upon him.
If then he will besiege us, let him try it.
But this I say; he'll find his own destruction 45
With his whole force before these ramparts, sooner
Than weary down the valour of our spirit.
He shall experience what a band of heroes,
Inspirited by an heroic leader,
Is able to perform. And if indeed 50
It be thy serious wish to make amends
For that which thou hast done amiss,&mdash;this, this
Will touch and reconcile the Emperor,
Who gladly turns his heart to thoughts of mercy,
And Friedland, who returns repentant to him, 55
Will stand yet higher in his Emperor's favour,
Than e'er he stood when he had never fallen.

Wallenstein (contemplates him with surprise, remains silent
awhile, betraying strong emotion). Gordon&mdash;your zeal and fervour lead you far.
Well, well&mdash;an old friend has a privilege.
Blood, Gordon, has been flowing. Never, never 60
Can the Emperor pardon me: and if he could,
Yet I&mdash;I ne'er could let myself be pardoned.
Had I foreknown what now has taken place,
That he, my dearest friend, would fall for me,
My first death-offering: and had the heart 65
Spoken to me, as now it has done&mdash;Gordon,
It may be, I might have bethought myself.
It may be too, I might not. Might or might not,
Is now an idle question. All too seriously
Has it begun to end in nothing, Gordon! 70
[803]Let it then have its course. [Stepping to the window.
All dark and silent&mdash;at the castle too
All is now hushed&mdash;Light me, Chamberlain!


[The Groom of the Chamber, who had entered during the last dialogue,
and had been standing at a distance and listening to it with visible
expressions of the deepest interest, advances in extreme agitation, and
throws himself at the Duke's feet.


And thou too! But I know why thou dost wish
My reconcilement with the Emperor. 75
Poor man! he hath a small estate in C&auml;rnthen,
And fears it will be forfeited because
He's in my service. Am I then so poor,
That I no longer can indemnify
My servants? Well! To no one I employ 80
Means of compulsion. If 'tis thy belief
That fortune has fled from me, go! Forsake me.
This night for the last time mayst thou unrobe me,
And then go over to thy Emperor.
Gordon, good night! I think to make a long 85
Sleep of it: for the struggle and the turmoil
Of this last day or two were great. May't please you!
Take care that they awake me not too early.


[Exit Wallenstein, the Groom of the Chamber lighting him. Seni
follows. Gordon remains on the darkened stage, following the Duke with
his eye, till he disappears at the farther end of the gallery: then by
his gestures the old man expresses the depth of his anguish, and stands
leaning against a pillar.

Scene IV

Gordon, Butler (at first behind the scenes).


Butler (not yet come into view of the stage). Here stand in silence till I give the signal.

Gordon (starts up). 'Tis he, he has already brought the murderers.

Butler. The lights are out. All lies in profound sleep.

Gordon. What shall I do, shall I attempt to save him?
Shall I call up the house? Alarm the guards? 5

Butler (appears, but scarcely on the stage). A light gleams hither from the corridor.
It leads directly to the Duke's bedchamber.


[804]


Gordon. But then I break my oath to the Emperor;
If he escape and strengthen the enemy,
Do I not hereby call down on my head 10
All the dread consequences?

Butler (stepping forward). Hark! Who speaks there?

Gordon. 'Tis better, I resign it to the hands
Of providence. For what am I, that I
Should take upon myself so great a deed?
I have not murdered him, if he be murdered: 15
But all his rescue were my act and deed;
Mine&mdash;and whatever be the consequences,
I must sustain them.

Butler (advances). I should know that voice.

Gordon. Butler!

Butler. 'Tis Gordon. What do you want here?
Was it so late then, when the Duke dismissed you? 20

Gordon. Your hand bound up and in a scarf?

Butler. 'Tis wounded.
That Illo fought as he was frantic, till
At last we threw him on the ground.

Gordon. Both dead?

Butler. Is he in bed?

Gordon. Ah, Butler!

Butler. Is he? speak.

Gordon. He shall not perish! Not through you! The Heaven 25
Refuses your arm. See&mdash;'tis wounded!&mdash;

Butler. There is no need of my arm.

Gordon. The most guilty
Have perished, and enough is given to justice.


[The Groom of the Chamber advances from the gallery with his finger
on his mouth, commanding silence.


Gordon. He sleeps! O murder not the holy sleep!

Butler. No! he shall die awake. [Is going.

Gordon. His heart still cleaves 30
To earthly things: he's not prepared to step
Into the presence of his God!

Butler (going). God's merciful!

Gordon (holds him). Grant him but this night's respite.

Butler (hurrying off). The next moment
[805]May ruin all.

Gordon (holds him still). One hour!&mdash;&mdash;

Butler. Unhold me! What
Can that short respite profit him?

Gordon. O&mdash;Time 35
Works miracles. In one hour many thousands
Of grains of sand run out; and quick as they,
Thought follows thought within the human soul.
Only one hour! Your heart may change its purpose,
His heart may change its purpose&mdash;some new tidings 40
May come; some fortunate event, decisive,
May fall from Heaven and rescue him. O what
May not one hour achieve!

Butler. You but remind me,
How precious every minute is!

Gordon (throwing himself between him and them). No, monster!
First over my dead body thou shalt tread.
I will not live to see the accursed deed!

Butler (forcing him out of the way). Weak-hearted dotard!


[Trumpets are heard in the distance.


Devereux and Macdonald. Hark! The Swedish trumpets!
The Swedes before the ramparts! Let us hasten! 5

Gordon (rushes out). O, God of Mercy!

Butler (calling after him). Governor, to your post!

Groom of the Chamber (hurries in). Who dares make larum here? Hush! The Duke sleeps.

Devereux (with loud harsh voice). Friend, it is time now to make larum.

Groom of the Chamber. Help!
Murder!

Butler. Down with him!

Groom of the Chamber (run through the body by Devereux, falls at the entrance of the gallery). Jesus Maria!

Butler. Burst the doors open! 10

Countess Tertsky (with a light). Her bed-chamber is empty; she herself
Is no where to be found! The Neubrunn too,
Who watched by her, is missing. If she should
Be flown&mdash;But whither flown? We must call up
Every soul in the house. How will the Duke 5
Bear up against these worst bad tidings? O
If that my husband now were but returned
Home from the banquet: Hark! I wonder whether
The Duke is still awake! I thought I heard
Voices and tread of feet here! I will go 10
And listen at the door. Hark! What is that?
'Tis hastening up the steps!




Scene VII

Countess, Gordon.


Gordon (rushes in out of breath). 'Tis a mistake,
'Tis not the Swedes&mdash;Ye must proceed no further&mdash;

Countess. You are come then from the castle? Where's my husband?

Loud cries, that wake the sleepers of this house?

Gordon. Your house is cursed to all eternity.

First Servant. Fly! fly! they murder us all!

Second Servant (carrying silver plate). That way! The lower 10

Scene IX

To these enters Octavio Piccolomini with all his train. At the same
time Devereux and Macdonald enter from out the Corridor with the
Halberdiers. Wallenstein's dead body is carried over the back part of
the stage, wrapped in a piece of crimson tapestry.


Octavio (entering abruptly). It must not be! It is not possible!
Butler! Gordon!
I'll not believe it. Say no!


[Gordon without answering points with his hand to the body of
Wallenstein as it is carried over the back of the stage. Octavio looks
that way, and stands overpowered with horror.


Devereux (to Butler). Here is the golden fleece&mdash;the Duke's sword&mdash;

Macdonald. Is it your order&mdash;

Butler (pointing to Octavio). Here stands he who now 5
Hath the sole power to issue orders.


[Devereux and Macdonald retire with marks of obeisance. One drops away
after the other, till only Butler, Octavio, and Gordon remain on the
stage.


Octavio (turning to Butler). Was that my purpose, Butler, when we parted?
O God of Justice!
To thee I lift my hand! I am not guilty
Of this foul deed.

Butler. Your hand is pure. You have 10
Availed yourself of mine.

Octavio. Merciless man!
Thus to abuse the orders of thy Lord&mdash;
And stain thy Emperor's holy name with murder,
With bloody, most accursed assassination!

Butler. I've but fulfilled the Emperor's own sentence. 15

Octavio. O curse of Kings,
Infusing a dread life into their words,
And linking to the sudden transient thought
The unchangeable irrevocable deed.
Was there necessity for such an eager 20
Despatch? Could'st thou not grant the merciful
[809]
A time for mercy? Time is man's good Angel.
To leave no interval between the sentence,
And the fulfilment of it, doth beseem
God only, the immutable!

Butler. For what 25
Rail you against me? What is my offence?
The Empire from a fearful enemy
Have I delivered, and expect reward.
The single difference betwixt you and me
Is this: you placed the arrow in the bow; 30
I pulled the string. You sowed blood, and yet stand
Astonished that blood is come up. I always
Knew what I did, and therefore no result
Hath power to frighten or surprise my spirit.
Have you aught else to order?&mdash;for this instant 35
I make my best speed to Vienna; place
My bleeding sword before my Emperor's throne,
And hope to gain the applause which undelaying
And punctual obedience may demand
From a just judge. [Exit Butler. 40

Scene X

To these enter the Countess Tertsky, pale and disordered. Her utterance
is slow and feeble, and unimpassioned.


Octavio (meeting her). O Countess Tertsky! These are the results
Of luckless unblest deeds.

Countess. They are the fruits
Of your contrivances. The Duke is dead,
My husband too is dead, the Duchess struggles
In the pangs of death, my niece has disappeared. 5
This house of splendour, and of princely glory,
Doth now stand desolated: the affrighted servants
Rush forth through all its doors. I am the last
Therein; I shut it up, and here deliver
The keys.

Octavio. O Countess! my house too is desolate. 10

Countess. Who next is to be murdered? Who is next
To be maltreated? Lo! The Duke is dead.
The Emperor's vengeance may be pacified!
Spare the old servants; let not their fidelity
[810]
Be imputed to the faithful as a crime&mdash; 15
The evil destiny surprised my brother
Too suddenly; he could not think on them.

Octavio. Speak not of vengeance! Speak not of maltreatment!
The Emperor is appeased; the heavy fault
Hath heavily been expiated&mdash;nothing 20
Descended from the father to the daughter,
Except his glory and his services.
The Empress honours your adversity,
Takes part in your afflictions, opens to you
Her motherly arms! Therefore no farther fears! 25
Yield yourself up in hope and confidence
To the Imperial Grace!

Countess. To the grace and mercy of a greater Master
Do I yield up myself. Where shall the body
Of the Duke have its place of final rest? 30
In the Chartreuse, which he himself did found,
At Gitschin rests the Countess Wallenstein;
And by her side, to whom he was indebted
For his first fortunes, gratefully he wished
He might sometime repose in death! O let him 35
Be buried there. And likewise, for my husband's
Remains, I ask the like grace. The Emperor
Is now proprietor of all our castles.
This sure may well be granted us&mdash;one sepulchre
Beside the sepulchres of our forefathers! 40

Octavio. Countess, you tremble, you turn pale!

Countess. You think
More worthily of me, than to believe
I would survive the downfall of my house.
We did not hold ourselves too mean to grasp
After a monarch's crown&mdash;the crown did fate 45
Deny, but not the feeling and the spirit
That to the crown belong! We deem a
Courageous death more worthy of our free station
Than a dishonoured life.&mdash;I have taken poison.

Octavio. Help! Help! Support her!

Countess. Nay, it is too late. 50
[811]
In a few moments is my fate accomplished. [Exit Countess.

Gordon. O house of death and horrors!


[An officer enters, and brings a letter with the great seal.


Gordon (steps forward and meets him). What is this?
It is the Imperial Seal.


[He reads the Address, and delivers the letter to Octavio with a look
of reproach, and with an emphasis on the word.


To the Prince Piccolomini.

eyes to heaven.

[812]
REMORSE[812:1]



PREFACE

This Tragedy was written in the summer and autumn of the year 1797; at
Nether Stowey, in the county of Somerset. By whose recommendation, and
of the manner in which both the Play and the Author were treated by the
Recommender, let me be permitted to relate: that I knew of its having
been received only by a third person; that I could procure neither
answer nor the manuscript; and that but for an accident I should have
had no copy of the Work itself. That such treatment would damp a young
man's exertions may be easily conceived: there was no need of
after-misrepresentation and calumny, as an additional sedative.

[812:2][As an amusing anecdote, and in the wish to prepare future
Authors, as young as I then was and as ignorant of the world, of[812:3]
the treatment they may meet with, I will add, that the Person[812:4] who
by a twice conveyed recommendation (in the year 1797) had urged me to
write a Tragedy[812:5]: who on my own objection that I was utterly
ignorant of all Stage-tactics had promised that he would himself make
the necessary alterations, if the Piece should be at all representable;
who together with the copy of the Play (hastened by his means so as to
prevent the full developement[812:6] of the characters) received a
letter from the Author to this purport, 'that conscious of his
inexperience, he had cherished no expectations, and should therefore
feel no disappointment from the rejection of the Play; but that if
beyond his hopes Mr. &mdash;&mdash; found in it any capability of being adapted to
the Stage, it was delivered to him as if it had been his own Manuscript,
to add, omit, or alter, as he saw occasion; and that (if it were
rejected) the Author would deem himself amply remunerated by the
addition to his Experience, which he should receive, if Mr. &mdash;&mdash; would
point out[812:7] to him the nature of its unfitness for public
[813]Representation';&mdash;that this very Person returned[813:1] me no answer,
and[813:2], spite of repeated applications, retained my Manuscript when
I was not conscious of any other Copy being in existence (my duplicate
having been destroyed by an accident); that he[813:3] suffered this
Manuscript to wander about the Town from his house, so that but ten days
ago I saw[813:4] the song in the third Act printed and set to music,
without my name, by Mr. Carnaby, in the year 1802; likewise that the
same person asserted[813:5] (as I have been assured) that the Play was
rejected, because I would not submit to the alteration of one ludicrous
line; and finally[813:6] in the year 1806 amused and delighted (as who
was ever in his company, if I may trust the universal report, without
being amused and delighted?) a large company at the house of a highly
respectable Member of Parliament, with the ridicule of the[813:7]
Tragedy, as 'a fair specimen', of the whole of which he adduced a
line:


'Drip! drip! drip! there's nothing here but dripping.'


In the original copy of the Play, in the first Scene of the fourth Act,
Isidore had commenced his Soliloquy in the Cavern with the words:


'Drip! drip! a ceaseless sound of water-drops,'[813:8],[813:9]


[814]as far as I can at present recollect: for on the possible ludicrous
association being pointed out to me, I instantly and thankfully struck
out the line. And as to my obstinate tenacity, not only my old
acquaintance, but (I dare boldly aver) both the Managers of Drury Lane
Theatre, and every Actor and Actress, whom I have recently met in the
Green Room, will repel the accusation: perhaps not without surprise.]

I thought it right to record these circumstances;[814:1] but I turn
gladly and with sincere gratitude to the converse. In the close of last
year I was advised to present the Tragedy once more to the Theatre.
Accordingly having altered the names, I ventured to address a letter to
Mr. Whitbread, requesting information as to whom I was to present my
Tragedy. My Letter was instantly and most kindly answered, and I have
now nothing to tell but a Tale of Thanks. I should scarce know where to
begin, if the goodness of the Manager, Mr. Arnold, had not called for my
first acknowledgements. Not merely as an acting Play, but as a
dramatic Poem, the 'Remorse' has been importantly and manifoldly
benefited by his suggestions. I can with severest truth say, that every
hint he gave me was the ground of some improvement. In the next place it
is my duty to mention Mr. Raymond, the Stage Manager. Had the 'Remorse'
been his own Play&mdash;nay, that is saying too little&mdash;had I been his
brother, or his dearest friend, he could not have felt or exerted
himself more zealously.

As the Piece is now acting, it may be thought presumptuous in me to
speak of the Actors; yet how can I abstain, feeling, as I do, Mrs.
Glover's[814:2] powerful assistance, and knowing the
circumstances[814:3] under which she consented to act Alhadra? A time
will come, when without painfully oppressing her feelings, I may speak
of this more fully. To Miss Smith I have an equal, [815]though different
acknowledgement to make, namely, for her acceptance of a character not
fully developed, and quite inadequate to her extraordinary powers. She
enlivened and supported many passages, which (though not perhaps wholly
uninteresting in the closet) would but for her have hung heavy on the
ears of a Theatrical Audience. And in speaking the Epilogue, a
composition which (I fear) my hurry will hardly excuse, and which, as
unworthy of her name, is here [1828, 1829, 1834] omitted, she made a
sacrifice, which only her established character with all judges of
Tragic action, could have rendered compatible with her duty to herself.
To Mr. De Camp's judgement and full conception of Isidore; to Mr. Pope's
accurate representation of the partial, yet honourable Father; to Mr.
Elliston's energy in the character of Alvar, and who in more than one
instance gave it beauties and striking points, which not only
delighted but surprised me; and to Mr. Rae[815:1], to whose zeal, and
unwearied study of his part, I am not less indebted as a Man, than to
his impassioned realization of Ordonio, as an Author;&mdash;&mdash;to these, and
to all concerned with the bringing out of the Play, I can address but
one word&mdash;Thanks!&mdash;but that word is uttered sincerely! and to persons
constantly before the eye of the Public, a public acknowledgement
becomes appropriate, and a duty.

I defer all answers to the different criticisms on the Piece to an
Essay, which I am about to publish immediately, on Dramatic Poetry,
relatively to the present State of the Metropolitan Theatres.

From the necessity of hastening the Publication I was obliged to send
the Manuscript intended for the Stage: which is the sole cause of the
number of directions printed in italics.

S. T. Coleridge.

others were ill, and one, with croup given over (tho' it has since

remonstrances, she was forced to act Alhadra on the Saturday!!!

Mrs. Glover (I do not much like her, in some respects) was duped into a
marriage with a worthless Sharper, who passed himself off on her as a
man of rank and fortune and who now lives and feeds himself and his
vices on her salary&mdash;and hence all her affections flow in the channel of
her maternal feelings. She is a passionately fond mother, and to act
Alhadra on the Saturday after the Thursday's Burial! MS. H. (For MS.

his voice&mdash;yet Ordonio has done him service. MS. H.



[816]
PROLOGUE

BY C. LAMB[816:1]

Spoken by Mr. Carr



There are, I am told, who sharply criticise
Our modern theatres' unwieldy size.
We players shall scarce plead guilty to that charge,
Who think a house can never be too large:
Griev'd when a rant, that's worth a nation's ear, 5
Shakes some prescrib'd Lyceum's petty sphere;
And pleased to mark the grin from space to space
Spread epidemic o'er a town's broad face.&mdash;
O might old Betterton or Booth return
To view our structures from their silent urn, 10
Could Quin come stalking from Elysian glades,
Or Garrick get a day-rule from the shades&mdash;
Where now, perhaps, in mirth which Spirits approve,
He imitates the ways of men above,
And apes the actions of our upper coast, 15
As in his days of flesh he play'd the ghost:&mdash;
How might they bless our ampler scope to please,
And hate their own old shrunk up audiences.&mdash;
Their houses yet were palaces to those,
Which Ben and Fletcher for their triumphs chose, 20
Shakspeare, who wish'd a kingdom for a stage,
Like giant pent in disproportion'd cage,
Mourn'd his contracted strengths and crippled rage.
He who could tame his vast ambition down
To please some scatter'd gleanings of a town, 25
And, if some hundred auditors supplied
Their meagre meed of claps, was satisfied,
How had he felt, when that dread curse of Lear's
Had burst tremendous on a thousand ears,
While deep-struck wonder from applauding bands 30
Return'd the tribute of as many hands!
Rude were his guests; he never made his bow
To such an audience as salutes us now.
He lack'd the balm of labour, female praise.
Few Ladies in his time frequented plays, 35
[817]
Or came to see a youth with awkward art
And shrill sharp pipe burlesque the woman's part.
The very use, since so essential grown,
Of painted scenes, was to his stage unknown.
The air-blest castle, round whose wholesome crest, 40
The martlet, guest of summer, chose her nest&mdash;
The forest walks of Arden's fair domain,
Where Jaques fed his solitary vein&mdash;
No pencil's aid as yet had dared supply,
Seen only by the intellectual eye. 45
Those scenic helps, denied to Shakspeare's page,
Our Author owes to a more liberal age.
Nor pomp nor circumstance are wanting here;
'Tis for himself alone that he must fear.
Yet shall remembrance cherish the just pride, 50
That (be the laurel granted or denied)
He first essay'd in this distinguished fane,
Severer muses and a tragic strain.

EPILOGUE

Written by the Author, and spoken by Miss Smith in the character of
Teresa.

[As printed in The Morning Chronicle, Jan. 28, 1813.]



Oh! the procrastinating idle rogue,
The Poet has just sent his Epilogue;
Ay, 'tis just like him!&mdash;and the hand!
[Poring over the manuscript.
The stick!
I could as soon decipher Arabic!
But, hark! my wizard's own poetic elf 5
Bids me take courage, and make one myself!
An heiress, and with sighing swains in plenty
From blooming nineteen to full-blown five-and-twenty,
Life beating high, and youth upon the wing,
'A six years' absence was a heavy thing!' 10
Heavy!&mdash;nay, let's describe things as they are,
With sense and nature 'twas at open war&mdash;
Mere affectation to be singular.
Yet ere you overflow in condemnation,
Think first of poor Teresa's education; 15
'Mid mountains wild, near billow-beaten rocks,
[818]
Where sea-gales play'd with her dishevel'd locks,
Bred in the spot where first to light she sprung,
With no Academies for ladies young&mdash;
Academies&mdash;(sweet phrase!) that well may claim 20
From Plato's sacred grove th' appropriate name!
No morning visits, no sweet waltzing dances&mdash;
And then for reading&mdash;what but huge romances,
With as stiff morals, leaving earth behind 'em,
As the brass-clasp'd, brass-corner'd boards that bind 'em. 25
Knights, chaste as brave, who strange adventures seek,
And faithful loves of ladies, fair as meek;
Or saintly hermits' wonder-raising acts,
Instead of&mdash;novels founded upon facts!
Which, decently immoral, have the art 30
To spare the blush, and undersap the heart!
Oh, think of these, and hundreds worse than these,
Dire disimproving disadvantages,
And grounds for pity, not for blame, you'll see,
E'en in Teresa's six years' constancy. 35
[Looking at the manuscript.
But stop! what's this?&mdash;Our Poet bids me say,
That he has woo'd your feelings in this Play
By no too real woes, that make you groan,
Recalling kindred griefs, perhaps your own,
Yet with no image compensate the mind, 40
Nor leave one joy for memory behind.
He'd wish no loud laugh, from the sly, shrewd sneer,
To unsettle from your eyes the quiet tear
That Pity had brought, and Wisdom would leave there.
Now calm he waits your judgment! (win or miss), 45
By no loud plaudits saved, damn'd by no factious hiss.

FOOTNOTES:

[819:1] Remorse, a recast of Osorio, was first played at
Drury Lane Theatre, January 23, 1813, and had a run of twenty nights. It
was first published as a pamphlet of seventy-two pages in 1813, and ran
through three editions. The Second Edition, which numbered seventy-eight
pages, was enlarged by an Appendix consisting of a passage which formed
part of Act IV, Scene 2 of Osorio, and had been published in the
Lyrical Ballads (1798, 1800, 1802, and 1805) as a separate poem
entitled 'The Foster-Mother's Tale' (vide ante, pp. 182-4, 571-4), and
of a second passage numbering twenty-eight lines, which was afterwards
printed as a footnote to Remorse, Act II, Scene 2, line 42 (vide
post, p. 842) 'You are a painter, &amp;c.' The Third Edition was a reissue
of the Second. In the Athen&aelig;um, April 1, 1896, J. D. Campbell points
out that there were three issues of the First Edition, of which he had
only seen the first; viz. (1) the normal text [Edition I]; (2) a second
issue [Edition I (b)] quoted by the Editor (R. H. Shepherd) of
Osorio, 1877, as a variant of Act V, line 252; (3) a third issue
quoted by the same writer in his edition of P. W., 1877-80, iii. 154,
155 [Edition I (c)]. There is a copy of Edition I (b) in the British
Museum: save in respect of Act V, line 252, it does not vary from
Edition I. I have not seen a copy of Edition I (c). Two copies of
Remorse annotated by S. T. Coleridge have passed through my hands, (1)
a copy of the First Edition presented to the Manager of the Theatre, J.
G. Raymond (MS. R.), and (2) a copy of the Second Edition presented to
Miss Sarah Hutchinson (MS. H.). Remorse is included in 1828, 1829,
and 1834.

[819:2] This Tragedy has a particular advantage&mdash;it has the
first scene, in which Prologue plays Dialogue with Dumby. (MS. H.)



[820]
ACT I

Scene I

The Sea Shore on the Coast of Granada.

Don Alvar, wrapt in a Boat cloak, and Zulimez (a Moresco), both as just
landed.


Zulimez. No sound, no face of joy to welcome us!

Alvar. My faithful Zulimez, for one brief moment
Let me forget my anguish and their crimes.
If aught on earth demand an unmix'd feeling,
'Tis surely this&mdash;after long years of exile, 5
To step forth on firm land, and gazing round us,
To hail at once our country, and our birth-place.
Hail, Spain! Granada, hail! once more I press
Thy sands with filial awe, land of my fathers!

Zulimez. Then claim your rights in it! O, revered Don Alvar, 10
Yet, yet give up your all too gentle purpose.
It is too hazardous! reveal yourself,
And let the guilty meet the doom of guilt!

Alvar. Remember, Zulimez! I am his brother,
Injured indeed! O deeply injured! yet 15
Ordonio's brother.

Zulimez. Nobly-minded Alvar!
This sure but gives his guilt a blacker dye.

Alvar. The more behoves it I should rouse within him
Remorse! that I should save him from himself.

Zulimez. Remorse is as the heart in which it grows: 20
If that be gentle, it drops balmy dews
Of true repentance; but if proud and gloomy,
It is a poison-tree, that pierced to the inmost
Weeps only tears of poison!

Alvar. And of a brother,
Dare I hold this, unproved? nor make one effort 25
To save him?&mdash;Hear me, friend! I have yet to tell thee,
That this same life, which he conspired to take,
Himself once rescued from the angry flood,
And at the imminent hazard of his own.
Add too my oath&mdash;

Zulimez. You have thrice told already 30
The years of absence and of secrecy,
[821]
To which a forced oath bound you; if in truth
A suborned murderer have the power to dictate
A binding oath&mdash;

Alvar. My long captivity
Left me no choice: the very wish too languished 35
With the fond hope that nursed it; the sick babe
Drooped at the bosom of its famished mother.
But (more than all) Teresa's perfidy;
The assassin's strong assurance, when no interest,
No motive could have tempted him to falsehood: 40
In the first pangs of his awaken'd conscience,
When with abhorrence of his own black purpose
The murderous weapon, pointed at my breast,
Fell from his palsied hand&mdash;

Zulimez. Heavy presumption!

Alvar. It weighed not with me&mdash;Hark! I will tell thee all; 45
As we passed by, I bade thee mark the base
Of yonder cliff&mdash;

Zulimez. That rocky seat you mean,
Shaped by the billows?&mdash;

Alvar. There Teresa met me
The morning of the day of my departure.
We were alone: the purple hue of dawn 50
Fell from the kindling east aslant upon us,
And blending with the blushes on her cheek,
Suffused the tear-drops there with rosy light.
There seemed a glory round us, and Teresa
The angel of the vision![821:1]

Had'st thou seen 55
How in each motion her most innocent soul
Beamed forth and brightened, thou thyself would'st tell me,
Guilt is a thing impossible in her!
She must be innocent!

Zulimez. Proceed, my lord!

Alvar. A portrait which she had procured by stealth, 60
(For even then it seems her heart foreboded
[822]
Or knew Ordonio's moody rivalry)
A portrait of herself with thrilling hand
She tied around my neck, conjuring me,
With earnest prayers, that I would keep it sacred 65
To my own knowledge: nor did she desist,
Till she had won a solemn promise from me,
That (save my own) no eye should e'er behold it
Till my return. Yet this the assassin knew,
Knew that which none but she could have disclosed. 70

Zulimez. A damning proof!

Alvar. My own life wearied me!
And but for the imperative voice within,
With mine own hand I had thrown off the burthen.
That voice, which quelled me, calmed me: and I sought
The Belgic states: there joined the better cause; 75
And there too fought as one that courted death!
Wounded, I fell among the dead and dying,
In death-like trance: a long imprisonment followed.
The fulness of my anguish by degrees
Waned to a meditative melancholy; 80
And still the more I mused, my soul became
More doubtful, more perplexed; and still Teresa,
Night after night, she visited my sleep,
Now as a saintly sufferer, wan and tearful,
Now as a saint in glory beckoning to me! 85
Yes, still as in contempt of proof and reason,
I cherish the fond faith that she is guiltless!
Hear then my fix'd resolve: I'll linger here
In the disguise of a Moresco chieftain.&mdash;
The Moorish robes?&mdash;

Zulimez. All, all are in the sea-cave, 90
Some furlong hence. I bade our mariners
Secrete the boat there.

Alvar. Above all, the picture
Of the assassination&mdash;

Zulimez. Be assured
That it remains uninjured.

Alvar. Thus disguised
I will first seek to meet Ordonio's&mdash;wife! 95
If possible, alone too. This was her wonted walk,
And this the hour; her words, her very looks
Will acquit her or convict.


[823]


Zulimez. Will they not know you?

Alvar. With your aid, friend, I shall unfearingly 100
Trust the disguise; and as to my complexion,
My long imprisonment, the scanty food,
This scar&mdash;and toil beneath a burning sun,
Have done already half the business for us.
Add too my youth, since last we saw each other. 105
Manhood has swoln my chest, and taught my voice
A hoarser note&mdash;Besides, they think me dead:
And what the mind believes impossible,
The bodily sense is slow to recognize.

Zulimez. 'Tis yours, sir, to command, mine to obey. 110
Now to the cave beneath the vaulted rock,
Where having shaped you to a Moorish chieftain,
I'll seek our mariners; and in the dusk
Transport whate'er we need to the small dell
In the Alpujarras&mdash;there where Zagri lived. 115

Alvar. I know it well: it is the obscurest haunt
Of all the mountains&mdash;[823:1]
[Both stand listening.
Voices at a distance!
Let us away! [Exeunt.

Scene II

Enter Teresa and Valdez.


Teresa. I hold Ordonio dear; he is your son
And Alvar's brother.

Valdez. Love him for himself,
Nor make the living wretched for the dead.

Teresa. I mourn that you should plead in vain, Lord Valdez,
But heaven hath heard my vow, and I remain 5
Faithful to Alvar, be he dead or living.

Valdez. Heaven knows with what delight I saw your loves,
And could my heart's blood give him back to thee
I would die smiling. But these are idle thoughts!
Thy dying father comes upon my soul 10
With that same look, with which he gave thee to me;
[824]
I held thee in my arms a powerless babe,
While thy poor mother with a mute entreaty
Fixed her faint eyes on mine. Ah not for this,
That I should let thee feed thy soul with gloom, 15
And with slow anguish wear away thy life,
The victim of a useless constancy.
I must not see thee wretched.

Teresa. There are woes
Ill bartered for the garishness of joy!
If it be wretched with an untired eye 20
To watch those skiey tints, and this green ocean;
Or in the sultry hour beneath some rock,
My hair dishevelled by the pleasant sea breeze,
To shape sweet visions, and live o'er again
All past hours of delight! If it be wretched 25
To watch some bark, and fancy Alvar there,
To go through each minutest circumstance
Of the blest meeting, and to frame adventures
Most terrible and strange, and hear him tell them;[824:1]
(As once I knew a crazy Moorish maid 30
Who drest her in her buried lover's clothes,
And o'er the smooth spring in the mountain cleft
Hung with her lute, and played the selfsame tune
He used to play, and listened to the shadow
Herself had made)&mdash;if this be wretchedness, 35
And if indeed it be a wretched thing
To trick out mine own death-bed, and imagine
That I had died, died just ere his return!
Then see him listening to my constancy,
Or hover round, as he at midnight oft 40
Sits on my grave and gazes at the moon;
Or haply in some more fantastic mood,
To be in Paradise, and with choice flowers
Build up a bower where he and I might dwell,
[825]
And there to wait his coming! O my sire! 45
My Alvar's sire! if this be wretchedness
That eats away the life, what were it, think you,
If in a most assured reality
He should return, and see a brother's infant
Smile at him from my arms? 50
Oh what a thought!

Valdez. A thought? even so! mere thought! an empty thought.
The very week he promised his return&mdash;&mdash;

Teresa. Was it not then a busy joy? to see him,
After those three years' travels! we had no fears&mdash; 55
The frequent tidings, the ne'er failing letter.
Almost endeared his absence! Yet the gladness,
The tumult of our joy! What then if now&mdash;&mdash;

Valdez. O power of youth to feed on pleasant thoughts,
Spite of conviction! I am old and heartless! 60
Yes, I am old&mdash;I have no pleasant fancies&mdash;
Hectic and unrefreshed with rest&mdash;

Teresa. My father!

Valdez. The sober truth is all too much for me!
I see no sail which brings not to my mind
The home-bound bark in which my son was captured 65
By the Algerine&mdash;to perish with his captors!

Teresa. Oh no! he did not!

Valdez. Captured in sight of land!
From yon hill point, nay, from our castle watch-tower
We might have seen&mdash;&mdash;

Teresa. His capture, not his death.

Valdez. Alas! how aptly thou forget'st a tale 70
Thou ne'er didst wish to learn! my brave Ordonio
Saw both the pirate and his prize go down,
In the same storm that baffled his own valour,
And thus twice snatched a brother from his hopes:
Gallant Ordonio! O beloved Teresa, 75
Would'st thou best prove thy faith to generous Alvar,
And most delight his spirit, go, make thou
[826]
His brother happy, make his aged father
Sink to the grave in joy.

Teresa. For mercy's sake
Press me no more! I have no power to love him. 80
His proud forbidding eye, and his dark brow,
Chill me like dew-damps of the unwholesome night:
My love, a timorous and tender flower,
Closes beneath his touch.

Valdez. You wrong him, maiden!
You wrong him, by my soul! Nor was it well 85
To character by such unkindly phrases
The stir and workings of that love for you
Which he has toiled to smother. 'Twas not well,
Nor is it grateful in you to forget
His wounds and perilous voyages, and how 90
With an heroic fearlessness of danger
He roam'd the coast of Afric for your Alvar.
It was not well&mdash;You have moved me even to tears.

Teresa. Oh pardon me, Lord Valdez! pardon me!
It was a foolish and ungrateful speech, 95
A most ungrateful speech! But I am hurried
Beyond myself, if I but hear of one
Who aims to rival Alvar. Were we not
Born in one day, like twins of the same parent?
Nursed in one cradle? Pardon me, my father! 100
A six years' absence is a heavy thing,
Yet still the hope survives&mdash;&mdash;

Valdez (looking forward). Hush! 'tis Monviedro.

Teresa. The Inquisitor! on what new scent of blood?


Enter Monviedro with Alhadra.


Monviedro. Peace and the truth be with you! Good my Lord, 105
My present need is with your son.
We have hit the time. Here comes he! Yes, 'tis he.
[Enter from the opposite side Don Ordonio.
My Lord Ordonio, this Moresco woman
(Alhadra is her name) asks audience of you.

Ordonio. Hail, reverend father! what may be the business? 110

Monviedro. My lord, on strong suspicion of relapse
[827]
To his false creed, so recently abjured,
The secret servants of the Inquisition
Have seized her husband, and at my command
To the supreme tribunal would have led him, 115
But that he made appeal to you, my lord,
As surety for his soundness in the faith.
Though lessoned by experience what small trust
The asseverations of these Moors deserve,
Yet still the deference to Ordonio's name, 120
Nor less the wish to prove, with what high honour
The Holy Church regards her faithful soldiers,
Thus far prevailed with me that&mdash;&mdash;

Ordonio. Reverend father,
I am much beholden to your high opinion,
Which so o'erprizes my light services. [Then to Alhadra. 125
I would that I could serve you; but in truth
Your face is new to me.

Monviedro. My mind foretold me
That such would be the event. In truth, Lord Valdez,
'Twas little probable, that Don Ordonio,
That your illustrious son, who fought so bravely 130
Some four years since to quell these rebel Moors,
Should prove the patron of this infidel!
The warranter of a Moresco's faith!
Now I return.

Alhadra. My Lord, my husband's name 135
Is Isidore. (Ordonio starts.) You may remember it:
Three years ago, three years this very week,
You left him at Almeria.

Monviedro. Palpably false!
This very week, three years ago, my lord,
(You needs must recollect it by your wound) 140
You were at sea, and there engaged the pirates,
The murderers doubtless of your brother Alvar!
What, is he ill, my Lord? how strange he looks!

Valdez. You pressed upon him too abruptly, father!
[828]
The fate of one, on whom, you know, he doted. 145

Ordonio. O Heavens! I?&mdash;I doted?
Yes! I doted on him. [Ordonio walks to the end of the stage, Valdez follows.

Teresa. I do not, can not, love him. Is my heart hard?
Is my heart hard? that even now the thought
Should force itself upon me?&mdash;Yet I feel it! 150

Monviedro. The drops did start and stand upon his forehead!
I will return. In very truth, I grieve
To have been the occasion. Ho! attend me, woman!

Alhadra (to Teresa). O gentle lady! make the father stay,
Until my lord recover. I am sure, 155
That he will say he is my husband's friend.

Teresa. Stay, father! stay! my lord will soon recover.

Ordonio (as they return, to Valdez). Strange, that this Monviedro
Should have the power so to distemper me!

Valdez. Nay, 'twas an amiable weakness, son! 160

Monviedro. My lord, I truly grieve&mdash;&mdash;

Ordonio. Tut! name it not.
A sudden seizure, father! think not of it.
As to this woman's husband, I do know him.
I know him well, and that he is a Christian.

Monviedro. I hope, my lord, your merely human pity 165
Doth not prevail&mdash;&mdash;

Ordonio. 'Tis certain that he was a catholic;
What changes may have happened in three years,
I can not say; but grant me this, good father:
Myself I'll sift him: if I find him sound, 170
You'll grant me your authority and name
To liberate his house.

Monviedro. Your zeal, my lord,
And your late merits in this holy warfare
Would authorize an ampler trust&mdash;you have it.

Ordonio. I will attend you home within an hour. 175

Valdez. Meantime return with us and take refreshment.

Alhadra. Not till my husband's free! I may not do it.
I will stay here.

[829]

Teresa (aside). Who is this Isidore?

Valdez. Daughter!

Teresa. With your permission, my dear lord, 180
I'll loiter yet awhile t' enjoy the sea breeze.


[Exeunt Valdez, Monviedro and Ordonio.


Alhadra. Hah! there he goes! a bitter curse go with him,
A scathing curse!
You hate him, don't you, lady?

Teresa. Oh fear not me! my heart is sad for you. 185

Alhadra. These fell inquisitors! these sons of blood!
As I came on, his face so maddened me,
That ever and anon I clutched my dagger
And half unsheathed it&mdash;&mdash;

Teresa. Be more calm, I pray you.

Alhadra. And as he walked along the narrow path 190
Close by the mountain's edge, my soul grew eager;
'Twas with hard toil I made myself remember
That his Familiars held my babes and husband.
To have leapt upon him with a tiger's plunge,
And hurl'd him down the rugged precipice, 195
O, it had been most sweet!

Teresa. Hush! hush for shame!
Where is your woman's heart?

Alhadra. O gentle lady!
You have no skill to guess my many wrongs,
Many and strange! Besides, I am a Christian,
And Christians never pardon&mdash;'tis their faith! 200

Teresa. Shame fall on those who so have shewn it to thee!

Alhadra. I know that man; 'tis well he knows not me.
Five years ago (and he was the prime agent),
Five years ago the holy brethren seized me.

Teresa. What might your crime be?

Alhadra. I was a Moresco! 205
They cast me, then a young and nursing mother,
Into a dungeon of their prison house,
Where was no bed, no fire, no ray of light,
No touch, no sound of comfort! The black air,
It was a toil to breathe it! when the door, 210
[830]
Slow opening at the appointed hour, disclosed
One human countenance, the lamp's red flame
Cowered as it entered, and at once sank down.
Oh miserable! by that lamp to see
My infant quarrelling with the coarse hard bread 215
Brought daily; for the little wretch was sickly&mdash;
My rage had dried away its natural food.[830:1]
In darkness I remained&mdash;the dull bell counting,
Which haply told me, that the all-cheering sun
Was rising on our garden. When I dozed, 220
My infant's moanings mingled with my slumbers
And waked me.&mdash;If you were a mother, lady,
I should scarce dare to tell you, that its noises
And peevish cries so fretted on my brain
That I have struck the innocent babe in anger. 225

Teresa. O Heaven! it is too horrible to hear.

Alhadra. What was it then to suffer? 'Tis most right
That such as you should hear it.&mdash;Know you not,
What nature makes you mourn, she bids you heal?[830:2]
Great evils ask great passions to redress them, 230
And whirlwinds fitliest scatter pestilence.

Teresa. You were at length released?

Alhadra. Yes, at length
I saw the blessed arch of the whole heaven!
'Twas the first time my infant smiled. No more&mdash;
For if I dwell upon that moment, Lady, 235
A trance comes on which makes me o'er again
All I then was&mdash;my knees hang loose and drag,
And my lip falls with such an idiot laugh,
That you would start and shudder!

Teresa. But your husband&mdash;

Alhadra. A month's imprisonment would kill him, Lady. 240

Teresa. Alas, poor man!

Alhadra. He hath a lion's courage,
Fearless in act, but feeble in endurance;
Unfit for boisterous times, with gentle heart
He worships nature in the hill and valley,
[831]
Not knowing what he loves, but loves it all&mdash; 245


Enter Alvar disguised as a Moresco, and in Moorish garments.


Teresa. Know you that stately Moor?

Alhadra. I know him not:
But doubt not he is some Moresco chieftain,
Who hides himself among the Alpujarras.

Teresa. The Alpujarras? Does he know his danger,
So near this seat?

Alhadra. He wears the Moorish robes too, 250
As in defiance of the royal edict.


[Alhadra advances to Alvar, who has walked to the back of the stage,
near the rocks. Teresa drops her veil.


Alhadra. Gallant Moresco! An inquisitor,
Monviedro, of known hatred to our race&mdash;&mdash;

Alvar. You have mistaken me. I am a Christian.

Alhadra. He deems, that we are plotting to ensnare him: 255
Speak to him, Lady&mdash;none can hear you speak,
And not believe you innocent of guile.

Teresa. If aught enforce you to concealment, Sir&mdash;

Alhadra. He trembles strangely.


[Alvar sinks down and hides his face in his robe.


Teresa. See, we have disturbed him.
[Approaches nearer to him.
I pray you, think us friends&mdash;uncowl your face, 260
For you seem faint, and the night-breeze blows healing.
I pray you, think us friends!

Alvar (raising his head). Calm, very calm!
'Tis all too tranquil for reality!
And she spoke to me with her innocent voice, 265
That voice, that innocent voice! She is no traitress!

Teresa. Let us retire (haughtily to Alhadra).

Alhadra. He is indeed a Christian.

Alvar (aside). She deems me dead, yet wears no mourning garment!
Why should my brother's&mdash;wife&mdash;wear mourning garments? 270
[To Teresa.
Your pardon, noble dame! that I disturbed you:
I had just started from a frightful dream.


[832]


Teresa. Dreams tell but of the past, and yet, 'tis said,
They prophesy&mdash;

Alvar. The Past lives o'er again
In its effects, and to the guilty spirit 275
The ever-frowning Present is its image.

Teresa. Traitress! (Then aside.)
What sudden spell o'ermasters me?
Why seeks he me, shunning the Moorish woman?

Alvar. I dreamt I had a friend, on whom I leant
With blindest trust, and a betroth&eacute;d maid, 280
Whom I was wont to call not mine, but me:
For mine own self seem'd nothing, lacking her.
This maid so idolized, that trusted friend
Dishonoured in my absence, soul and body!
Fear, following guilt, tempted to blacker guilt, 285
And murderers were suborned against my life.
But by my looks, and most impassioned words,
I roused the virtues that are dead in no man,
Even in the assassins' hearts! they made their terms,
And thanked me for redeeming them from murder. 290

Alhadra. You are lost in thought: hear him no more, sweet Lady!

Teresa. From morn to night I am myself a dreamer,
And slight things bring on me the idle mood!
Well sir, what happened then?

Alvar. On a rude rock,
A rock, methought, fast by a grove of firs, 295
Whose thready leaves to the low-breathing gale
Made a soft sound most like the distant ocean,
I stayed, as though the hour of death were passed,
And I were sitting in the world of spirits&mdash;
For all things seemed unreal! There I sate&mdash; 300
The dews fell clammy, and the night descended,
Black, sultry, close! and ere the midnight hour
A storm came on, mingling all sounds of fear,
That woods, and sky, and mountains, seemed one havock.
The second flash of lightning shewed a tree 305
Hard by me, newly scathed. I rose tumultuous:
My soul worked high, I bared my head to the storm,
And with loud voice and clamorous agony,
Kneeling I prayed to the great Spirit that made me,
[833]
Prayed, that Remorse might fasten on their hearts, 310
And cling with poisonous tooth, inextricable
As the gored lion's bite!

Teresa. A fearful curse!

Alhadra. But dreamt you not that you returned and killed them?
Dreamt you of no revenge?

Alvar. She would have died
Died in her guilt&mdash;perchance by her own hands! 315
And bending o'er her self-inflicted wounds,
I might have met the evil glance of frenzy,
And leapt myself into an unblest grave!
I prayed for the punishment that cleanses hearts:
For still I loved her!

Alhadra. And you dreamt all this? 320

Teresa. My soul is full of visions all as wild!

Alhadra. There is no room in this heart for puling love-tales.

Teresa (lifts up her veil, and advances to Alvar). Stranger, farewell! I guess not who you are,
Nor why you so addressed your tale to me.
Your mien is noble, and, I own, perplexed me, 325
With obscure memory of something past,
Which still escaped my efforts, or presented
Tricks of a fancy pampered with long wishing.
If, as it sometimes happens, our rude startling,
Whilst your full heart was shaping out its dream, 330
Drove you to this, your not ungentle, wildness&mdash;
You have my sympathy, and so farewell!
But if some undiscovered wrongs oppress you,
And you need strength to drag them into light,
The generous Valdez, and my Lord Ordonio, 335
Have arm and will to aid a noble sufferer,
Nor shall you want my favourable pleading.[833:1]


[Exeunt Teresa and Alhadra.


Alvar (alone). 'Tis strange! It cannot be! my Lord Ordonio!
[834]
Her Lord Ordonio! Nay, I will not do it!
I cursed him once&mdash;and one curse is enough! 340
How sad she looked, and pale! but not like guilt&mdash;
And her calm tones&mdash;sweet as a song of mercy!
If the bad spirit retain'd his angel's voice,
Hell scarce were Hell. And why not innocent?
Who meant to murder me, might well cheat her? 345
But ere she married him, he had stained her honour;
Ah! there I am hampered. What if this were a lie
Framed by the assassin? Who should tell it him,
If it were truth? Ordonio would not tell him.
Yet why one lie? all else, I know, was truth. 350
No start, no jealousy of stirring conscience!
And she referred to me&mdash;fondly, methought!
Could she walk here if she had been a traitress?
Here where we played together in our childhood?
Here where we plighted vows? where her cold cheek 355
Received my last kiss, when with suppressed feelings
She had fainted in my arms? It cannot be!
'Tis not in nature! I will die believing,
That I shall meet her where no evil is,
No treachery, no cup dashed from the lips. 360
I'll haunt this scene no more! live she in peace!
Her husband&mdash;aye her husband! May this angel
New mould his canker'd heart! Assist me, heaven,
That I may pray for my poor guilty brother! [Exit.

ACT II

Scene I

A wild and mountainous country. Ordonio and Isidore are discovered,
supposed at a little distance from Isidore's house.


Ordonio. Here we may stop: your house distinct in view,
Yet we secured from listeners.

Isidore. Now indeed
[835]
My house! and it looks cheerful as the clusters
Basking in sunshine on yon vine-clad rock,
That over-brows it! Patron! Friend! Preserver! 5
Thrice have you saved my life. Once in the battle
You gave it me: next rescued me from suicide
When for my follies I was made to wander,
With mouths to feed, and not a morsel for them:
Now but for you, a dungeon's slimy stones 10
Had been my bed and pillow.

Ordonio. Good Isidore!
Why this to me? It is enough, you know it.

Isidore. A common trick of gratitude, my lord,
Seeking to ease her own full heart&mdash;&mdash;

Ordonio. Enough!
A debt repaid ceases to be a debt. 15
You have it in your power to serve me greatly.

Isidore. And how, my lord? I pray you to name the thing.
I would climb up an ice-glazed precipice
To pluck a weed you fancied!

Ordonio. Why&mdash;that&mdash;Lady&mdash;

Isidore. 'Tis now three years, my lord, since last I saw you: 20
Have you a son, my lord?

Ordonio. O miserable&mdash; [Aside.
Isidore! you are a man, and know mankind.
I told you what I wished&mdash;now for the truth&mdash;
She loved the man you kill'd.

Isidore. You jest, my lord?

Ordonio. And till his death is proved she will not wed me. 25

Isidore. You sport with me, my lord?

Ordonio. Come, come! this foolery
Lives only in thy looks, thy heart disowns it!

Isidore. I can bear this, and any thing more grievous
From you, my lord&mdash;but how can I serve you here?

Ordonio. Why, you can utter with a solemn gesture 30
Oracular sentences of deep no-meaning,
Wear a quaint garment, make mysterious antics&mdash;

Isidore. I am dull, my lord! I do not comprehend you.

Ordonio. In blunt terms, you can play the sorcerer.
She hath no faith in Holy Church, 'tis true: 35
[836]
Her lover schooled her in some newer nonsense!
Yet still a tale of spirits works upon her.
She is a lone enthusiast, sensitive,
Shivers, and can not keep the tears in her eye:
And such do love the marvellous too well 40
Not to believe it. We will wind up her fancy
With a strange music, that she knows not of&mdash;
With fumes of frankincense, and mummery,
Then leave, as one sure token of his death,
That portrait, which from off the dead man's neck 45
I bade thee take, the trophy of thy conquest.

Isidore. Will that be a sure sign?

Ordonio. Beyond suspicion.
Fondly caressing him, her favour'd lover,
(By some base spell he had bewitched her senses)
She whispered such dark fears of me forsooth, 50
As made this heart pour gall into my veins.
And as she coyly bound it round his neck
She made him promise silence; and now holds
The secret of the existence of this portrait
Known only to her lover and herself. 55
But I had traced her, stolen unnotic'd on them,
And unsuspected saw and heard the whole.

Isidore. But now I should have cursed the man who told me
You could ask aught, my lord, and I refuse&mdash;
But this I can not do.

Ordonio. Where lies your scruple? 60

Isidore. Why&mdash;why, my lord!
You know you told me that the lady lov'd you,
Had loved you with incautious tenderness;
That if the young man, her betroth&eacute;d husband,
Returned, yourself, and she, and the honour of both 65
Must perish. Now though with no tenderer scruples
Than those which being native to the heart,
Than those, my lord, which merely being a man&mdash;

Ordonio. This fellow is a Man&mdash;he killed for hire
One whom he knew not, yet has tender scruples! 70
[Then turning to Isidore.
[837]
These doubts, these fears, thy whine, thy stammering&mdash;
Pish, fool! thou blunder'st through the book of guilt,
Spelling thy villainy.

Isidore. My lord&mdash;my lord,
I can bear much&mdash;yes, very much from you!
But there's a point where sufferance is meanness: 75
I am no villain&mdash;never kill'd for hire&mdash;
My gratitude&mdash;&mdash;

Ordonio. O aye&mdash;your gratitude!
'Twas a well-sounding word&mdash;what have you done with it?

Isidore. Who proffers his past favours for my virtue&mdash;

Ordonio. Virtue&mdash;&mdash;

Isidore. Tries to o'erreach me&mdash;is a very sharper, 80
And should not speak of gratitude, my lord.
I knew not 'twas your brother!

Ordonio. And who told you?

Isidore. He himself told me.

Ordonio. Ha! you talk'd with him!
And those, the two Morescoes who were with you?

Isidore. Both fell in a night brawl at Malaga. 85

Ordonio (in a low voice). My brother&mdash;

Isidore. Yes, my lord, I could not tell you!
I thrust away the thought&mdash;it drove me wild.
But listen to me now&mdash;I pray you listen&mdash;&mdash;

Ordonio. Villain! no more. I'll hear no more of it.

Isidore. My lord, it much imports your future safety 90
That you should hear it.

Ordonio (turning off from Isidore). Am not I a man!
'Tis as it should be! tut&mdash;the deed itself
Was idle, and these after-pangs still idler!

Isidore. We met him in the very place you mentioned.
Hard by a grove of firs&mdash;

Ordonio. Enough&mdash;enough&mdash; 95

Isidore. He fought us valiantly, and wounded all;
In fine, compelled a parley.

Ordonio. Alvar! brother!

Isidore. He offered me his purse&mdash;

Ordonio. Yes?


[838]


Isidore. Yes&mdash;I spurned it.&mdash;
He promised us I know not what&mdash;in vain!
Then with a look and voice that overawed me, 100
He said, What mean you, friends? My life is dear:
I have a brother and a promised wife,
Who make life dear to me&mdash;and if I fall,
That brother will roam earth and hell for vengeance.
There was a likeness in his face to yours; 105
I asked his brother's name: he said&mdash;Ordonio,
Son of Lord Valdez! I had well nigh fainted.
At length I said (if that indeed I said it,
And that no Spirit made my tongue its organ,)
That woman is dishonoured by that brother, 110
And he the man who sent us to destroy you.
He drove a thrust at me in rage. I told him
He wore her portrait round his neck. He look'd
As he had been made of the rock that propt his back&mdash;
Aye, just as you look now&mdash;only less ghastly! 115
At length recovering from his trance, he threw
His sword away, and bade us take his life,
It was not worth his keeping.

Ordonio. And you kill'd him?
Oh blood hounds! may eternal wrath flame round you!
He was his Maker's Image undefac'd! 120
It seizes me&mdash;by Hell I will go on!
What&mdash;would'st thou stop, man? thy pale looks won't save thee!
Oh cold&mdash;cold&mdash;cold! shot through with icy cold!

Isidore (aside). Were he alive he had returned ere now.
The consequence the same&mdash;dead through his plotting! 125

Ordonio. O this unutterable dying away&mdash;here&mdash;
This sickness of the heart!
What if I went
And liv'd in a hollow tomb, and fed on weeds?
Aye! that's the road to heaven! O fool! fool! fool!
What have I done but that which nature destined, 130
Or the blind elements stirred up within me?
If good were meant, why were we made these beings?
And if not meant&mdash;


[839]


Isidore. You are disturbed, my lord!

Ordonio (starts). A gust of the soul! i'faith it overset me.
O 'twas all folly&mdash;all! idle as laughter! 135
Now, Isidore! I swear that thou shalt aid me.

Isidore (in a low voice). I'll perish first!

Ordonio. What dost thou mutter of?

Isidore. Some of your servants know me, I am certain.

Ordonio. There's some sense in that scruple; but we'll mask you.

Isidore. They'll know my gait: but stay! last night I watched 140
A stranger near the ruin in the wood,
Who as it seemed was gathering herbs and wild flowers.
I had followed him at distance, seen him scale
Its western wall, and by an easier entrance
Stole after him unnoticed. There I marked, 145
That mid the chequer work of light and shade
With curious choice he plucked no other flowers,
But those on which the moonlight fell: and once
I heard him muttering o'er the plant. A wizard&mdash;
Some gaunt slave prowling here for dark employment. 150

Ordonio. Doubtless you question'd him?

Isidore. 'Twas my intention,
Having first traced him homeward to his haunt.
But lo! the stern Dominican, whose spies
Lurk every where, already (as it seemed)
Had given commission to his apt familiar 155
To seek and sound the Moor; who now returning,
Was by this trusty agent stopped midway.
I, dreading fresh suspicion if found near him
In that lone place, again concealed myself:
Yet within hearing. So the Moor was question'd, 160
And in your name, as lord of this domain,
Proudly he answered, 'Say to the Lord Ordonio,
He that can bring the dead to life again!'

Ordonio. A strange reply!

Isidore. Aye, all of him is strange.
He called himself a Christian, yet he wears 165
The Moorish robes, as if he courted death.

Ordonio. Where does this wizard live?


[840]


Isidore (pointing to the distance). You see that brooklet?
Trace its course backward: through a narrow opening
It leads you to the place.

Ordonio. How shall I know it?

Isidore. You cannot err. It is a small green dell 170
Built all around with high off-sloping hills,
And from its shape our peasants aptly call it
The Giant's Cradle. There's a lake in the midst,
And round its banks tall wood that branches over,
And makes a kind of faery forest grow 175
Down in the water. At the further end
A puny cataract falls on the lake;
And there, a curious sight! you see its shadow
For ever curling, like a wreath of smoke,
Up through the foliage of those faery trees. 180
His cot stands opposite. You cannot miss it.

Ordonio (in retiring stops suddenly at the edge of the scene, and then turning round to Isidore). Ha!&mdash;Who lurks there! Have we been overheard?
There where the smooth high wall of slate-rock glitters&mdash;&mdash;

Isidore. 'Neath those tall stones, which propping each the other,
Form a mock portal with their pointed arch? 185
Pardon my smiles! 'Tis a poor idiot boy,
Who sits in the sun, and twirls a bough about,
His weak eyes seeth'd in most unmeaning tears.
And so he sits, swaying his cone-like head,
And staring at his bough from morn to sun-set, 190
See-saws his voice in inarticulate noises.

Ordonio. 'Tis well, and now for this same wizard's lair.

Isidore. Some three strides up the hill, a mountain ash
Stretches its lower boughs and scarlet clusters
O'er the old thatch.

Ordonio. I shall not fail to find it. 195


[Exeunt Ordonio and Isidore.

[841]
Scene II

The inside of a Cottage, around which flowers and plants of various
kinds are seen. Discovers Alvar, Zulimez and Alhadra, as on the point of
leaving.


Alhadra (addressing Alvar). Farewell then! and though many thoughts perplex me,
Aught evil or ignoble never can I
Suspect of thee! If what thou seem'st thou art,
The oppressed brethren of thy blood have need
Of such a leader.

Alvar. Nobly-minded woman! 5
Long time against oppression have I fought,
And for the native liberty of faith
Have bled and suffered bonds. Of this be certain:
Time, as he courses onward, still unrolls
The volume of concealment. In the future, 10
As in the optician's glassy cylinder,
The indistinguishable blots and colours
Of the dim past collect and shape themselves,
Upstarting in their own completed image
To scare or to reward.
I sought the guilty, 15
And what I sought I found: but ere the spear
Flew from my hand, there rose an angel form
Betwixt me and my aim. With baffled purpose
To the Avenger I leave vengeance, and depart!

Whate'er betide, if aught my arm may aid, 20
Or power protect, my word is pledged to thee:
For many are thy wrongs, and thy soul noble.
Once more, farewell. [Exit Alhadra.
Yes, to the Belgic states
We will return. These robes, this stained complexion,
Akin to falsehood, weigh upon my spirit. 25
Whate'er befall us, the heroic Maurice
Will grant us an asylum, in remembrance
Of our past services.

Zulimez. And all the wealth, power, influence which is yours,
You let a murderer hold?

Alvar. O faithful Zulimez! 30
That my return involved Ordonio's death,
I trust, would give me an unmingled pang,
[842]
Yet bearable: but when I see my father
Strewing his scant grey hairs, e'en on the ground,
Which soon must be his grave, and my Teresa&mdash; 35
Her husband proved a murderer, and her infants
His infants&mdash;poor Teresa!&mdash;all would perish,
All perish&mdash;all! and I (nay bear with me)
Could not survive the complicated ruin!

Zulimez. Nay now! I have distress'd you&mdash;you well know, 40
I ne'er will quit your fortunes. True,'tis tiresome!
You are a painter,[842:1] one of many fancies!
[843]
You can call up past deeds, and make them live
On the blank canvas! and each little herb,
That grows on mountain bleak, or tangled forest, 45
You have learnt to name&mdash;&mdash;
Hark! heard you not some footsteps?

Alvar. What if it were my brother coming onwards?
I sent a most mysterious message to him.


Enter Ordonio


Alvar. It is he!

Ordonio (to himself as he enters). If I distinguish'd right her gait and stature, 50
It was the Moorish woman, Isidore's wife,
That passed me as I entered. A lit taper,
In the night air, doth not more naturally
Attract the night-flies round it, than a conjuror
Draws round him the whole female neighbourhood. 55
[Addressing Alvar.
You know my name, I guess, if not my person.
I am Ordonio, son of the Lord Valdez.

Alvar. The Son of Valdez!


[Ordonio walks leisurely round the room, and looks attentively at the
plants.


Zulimez (to Alvar). Why, what ails you now?
How your hand trembles! Alvar, speak! what wish you?

Alvar. To fall upon his neck and weep forgiveness! 60

Ordonio (returning, and aloud). Plucked in the moonlight from a ruined abbey&mdash;
Those only, which the pale rays visited!
O the unintelligible power of weeds,
When a few odd prayers have been muttered o'er them:
Then they work miracles! I warrant you, 65
There's not a leaf, but underneath it lurks
Some serviceable imp.
There's one of you
Hath sent me a strange message.

Alvar. I am he.

Ordonio. With you, then, I am to speak: [Haughtily waving his hand to Zulimez.
And mark you, alone. [Exit Zulimez. 70
[844]
'He that can bring the dead to life again!'&mdash;
Such was your message, Sir! You are no dullard,
But one that strips the outward rind of things!

Alvar. 'Tis fabled there are fruits with tempting rinds,
That are all dust and rottenness within. 75
Would'st thou I should strip such?

Ordonio. Thou quibbling fool,
What dost thou mean? Think'st thou I journeyed hither
To sport with thee?

Alvar. O no, my lord! to sport
Best suits the gaiety of innocence.

Ordonio (aside). O what a thing is man! the wisest heart 80
A fool! a fool that laughs at its own folly,
Yet still a fool! [Looks round the cottage.
You are poor!

Alvar. What follows thence?

Ordonio. That you would fain be richer.
The inquisition, too&mdash;You comprehend me?
You are poor, in peril. I have wealth and power, 85
Can quench the flames, and cure your poverty:
And for the boon I ask of you but this,
That you should serve me&mdash;once&mdash;for a few hours.

Alvar. Thou art the son of Valdez! would to Heaven
That I could truly and for ever serve thee. 90

Ordonio. The slave begins to soften. [Aside.
You are my friend,
'He that can bring the dead to life again,'
Nay, no defence to me! The holy brethren
Believe these calumnies&mdash;I know thee better.
Thou art a man, and as a man I'll trust thee! 95

Alvar (aside). Alas! this hollow mirth&mdash;Declare your business.

Ordonio. I love a lady, and she would love me
But for an idle and fantastic scruple.
Have you no servants here, no listeners? [Ordonio steps to the door.

Alvar. What, faithless too? False to his angel wife? 100
To such a wife? Well might'st thou look so wan,
Ill-starr'd Teresa!&mdash;--Wretch! my softer soul
Is pass'd away, and I will probe his conscience!

Ordonio. In truth this lady lov'd another man,
But he has perish'd.


[845]


Alvar. What! you kill'd him? hey? 105

Ordonio. I'll dash thee to the earth, if thou but think'st it!
Insolent slave! how dar'dst thou&mdash; [Turns abruptly from Alvar, and then to himself.
Why! what's this?
'Twas idiotcy! I'll tie myself to an aspen,
And wear a fool's cap&mdash;

Alvar. Fare thee well&mdash;[845:1]
I pity thee, Ordonio, even to anguish. [Alvar is retiring.

Ordonio. Ho! [Calling to Alvar. 110

Alvar. Be brief, what wish you?

Ordonio. You are deep at bartering&mdash;You charge yourself
At a round sum. Come, come, I spake unwisely.

Alvar. I listen to you.

Ordonio. In a sudden tempest
Did Alvar perish&mdash;he, I mean&mdash;the lover&mdash; 115
The fellow&mdash;&mdash;

Alvar. Nay, speak out! 'twill ease your heart
To call him villain!&mdash;Why stand'st thou aghast?
Men think it natural to hate their rivals.

Ordonio. Now, till she knows him dead, she will not wed me.

Alvar. Are you not wedded, then? Merciful Heaven! 120
Not wedded to Teresa?

Ordonio. Why, what ails thee?
What, art thou mad? why look'st thou upward so?
Dost pray to Lucifer, Prince of the Air?

Alvar. Proceed. I shall be silent.

Ordonio. To Teresa?
Politic wizard! ere you sent that message, 125
You had conn'd your lesson, made yourself proficient
In all my fortunes. Hah! you prophesied
A golden crop! Well, you have not mistaken&mdash;
[846]
Be faithful to me and I'll pay thee nobly.

Alvar. Well! and this lady! 130

Ordonio. If we could make her certain of his death,
She needs must wed me. Ere her lover left her,
She tied a little portrait round his neck,
Entreating him to wear it.

Alvar. Yes! he did so!

Ordonio. Why no: he was afraid of accidents, 135
Of robberies, and shipwrecks, and the like.
In secrecy he gave it me to keep,
Till his return.

Alvar. What! he was your friend then?

Ordonio. I was his friend.&mdash;
Now that he gave it me, 140
This lady knows not. You are a mighty wizard&mdash;
Can call the dead man up&mdash;he will not come.&mdash;
He is in heaven then&mdash;there you have no influence.
Still there are tokens&mdash;and your imps may bring you
Something he wore about him when he died. 145
And when the smoke of the incense on the altar
Is pass'd, your spirits will have left this picture.
What say you now?

Alvar. Ordonio, I will do it.

Ordonio. We'll hazard no delay. Be it to-night,
In the early evening. Ask for the Lord Valdez. 150
I will prepare him. Music too, and incense,
(For I have arranged it&mdash;music, altar, incense)
All shall be ready. Here is this same picture,
And here, what you will value more, a purse.
Come early for your magic ceremonies. 155

Alvar. I will not fail to meet you.

Ordonio. Till next we meet, farewell! [Exit Ordonio.

Alvar (alone, indignantly flings the purse away and gazes passionately
at the portrait). And I did curse thee!
At midnight! on my knees! and I believed
Thee perjur'd, thee a traitress! thee dishonour'd!
O blind and credulous fool! O guilt of folly! 160
Should not thy inarticulate fondnesses,
[847]
Thy infant loves&mdash;should not thy maiden vows
Have come upon my heart? And this sweet Image
Tied round my neck with many a chaste endearment,
And thrilling hands, that made me weep and tremble&mdash; 165
Ah, coward dupe! to yield it to the miscreant,
Who spake pollution of thee! barter for life
This farewell pledge, which with impassioned vow
I had sworn that I would grasp&mdash;ev'n in my Death-pang!

I am unworthy of thy love, Teresa, 170
Of that unearthly smile upon those lips,
Which ever smiled on me! Yet do not scorn me&mdash;
I lisp'd thy name, ere I had learnt my mother's.

Dear portrait! rescued from a traitor's keeping,
I will not now profane thee, holy image, 175
To a dark trick. That worst bad man shall find
A picture, which will wake the hell within him,
And rouse a fiery whirlwind in his conscience.




FOOTNOTES:

[842:1] The following lines I have preserved in this place, not
so much as explanatory of the picture of the assassination, as (if I may
say so without disrespect to the Public) to gratify my own feelings, the
passage being no mere fancy portrait; but a slight, yet not
unfaithful, profile of one[842:A], who still lives, nobilitate felix,
arte clarior, vit&acirc; colendissimus.


Zulimez (speaking of Alvar in the third person). Such was the noble Spaniard's own relation.
He told me, too, how in his early youth,
And his first travels, 'twas his choice or chance
To make long sojourn in sea-wedded Venice;
There won the love of that divine old man,
Courted by mightiest kings, the famous Titian!
Who, like a second and more lovely Nature,
By the sweet mystery of lines and colours
Changed the blank canvas to a magic mirror,
That made the absent present; and to shadows
Gave light, depth, substance, bloom, yea, thought and motion.
He loved the old man, and revered his art:
And though of noblest birth and ample fortune,
The young enthusiast thought it no scorn
But this inalienable ornament,
To be his pupil, and with filial zeal
By practice to appropriate the sage lessons,
Which the gay, smiling old man gladly gave.
The art, he honoured thus, requited him:
And in the following and calamitous years
Beguiled the hours of his captivity.

Alhadra. And then he framed this picture? and unaided
By arts unlawful, spell, or talisman!

Alvar. A potent spell, a mighty talisman!
The imperishable memory of the deed,
Sustained by love, and grief, and indignation!
So vivid were the forms within his brain,
His very eyes, when shut, made pictures of them!

I pity thee, Ordonio, even to anguish.

ACT III

Scene I

A Hall of Armory, with an Altar at the back of the Stage. Soft Music
from an instrument of Glass or Steel.

Valdez, Ordonio, and Alvar in a Sorcerer's robe, are discovered.


Ordonio. This was too melancholy, Father.

Valdez. Nay,
My Alvar lov'd sad music from a child.
Once he was lost; and after weary search
We found him in an open place in the wood.
To which spot he had followed a blind boy, 5
Who breath'd into a pipe of sycamore
Some strangely moving notes: and these, he said,
Were taught him in a dream. Him we first saw
Stretch'd on the broad top of a sunny heath-bank:
And lower down poor Alvar, fast asleep, 10
His head upon the blind boy's dog. It pleas'd me
To mark how he had fasten'd round the pipe
A silver toy his grandam had late given him.
Methinks I see him now as he then look'd&mdash;
[848]
Even so!&mdash;He had outgrown his infant dress, 15
Yet still he wore it.

Alvar (aside). My tears must not flow!
I must not clasp his knees, and cry, My father!


Enter Teresa and Attendants.


Teresa. Lord Valdez, you have asked my presence here,
And I submit; but (Heaven bear witness for me)
My heart approves it not! 'tis mockery. 20

Ordonio. Believe you then no preternatural influence:
Believe you not that spirits throng around us?

Teresa. Say rather that I have imagined it
A possible thing: and it has sooth'd my soul
As other fancies have; but ne'er seduced me 25
To traffic with the black and frenzied hope
That the dead hear the voice of witch or wizard. [To Alvar.
Stranger, I mourn and blush to see you here,
On such employment! With far other thoughts
I left you. 30

Ordonio (aside). Ha! he has been tampering with her?

Alvar. O high-soul'd Maiden! and more dear to me
Than suits the stranger's name!&mdash;
I swear to thee
I will uncover all conceal&eacute;d guilt.
Doubt, but decide not! Stand ye from the altar. 35


[Here a strain of music is heard from behind the scene.


Alvar. With no irreverent voice or uncouth charm
I call up the departed!
Soul of Alvar!
Hear our soft suit, and heed my milder spell:
So may the gates of Paradise, unbarr'd,
Cease thy swift toils! Since haply thou art one 40
Of that innumerable company
Who in broad circle, lovelier than the rainbow,
Girdle this round earth in a dizzy motion,
With noise too vast and constant to be heard:
Fitliest unheard! For oh, ye numberless, 45
And rapid travellers! what ear unstunn'd,
What sense unmadden'd, might bear up against
The rushing of your congregated wings? [Music.
Even now your living wheel turns o'er my head!
[849]
Ye, as ye pass, toss high the desart sands, 50
That roar and whiten, like a burst of waters,
A sweet appearance, but a dread illusion
To the parch'd caravan that roams by night!
And ye upbuild on the becalmed waves
That whirling pillar, which from earth to heaven 55
Stands vast, and moves in blackness! Ye too split
The ice mount! and with fragments many and huge
Tempest the new-thaw'd sea, whose sudden gulfs
Suck in, perchance, some Lapland wizard's skiff!
Then round and round the whirlpool's marge ye dance, 60
Till from the blue swoln corse the soul toils out,
And joins your mighty army.

[Here behind the scenes a voice sings the three words, 'Hear, Sweet
Spirit.'

Soul of Alvar!
Hear the mild spell, and tempt no blacker charm!
By sighs unquiet, and the sickly pang
Of a half-dead, yet still undying hope, 65
Pass visible before our mortal sense!
So shall the Church's cleansing rites be thine,
Her knells and masses that redeem the dead!



SONG


Behind the Scenes, accompanied by the same Instrument as before.


Hear, sweet spirit, hear the spell,
Lest a blacker charm compel! 70
So shall the midnight breezes swell
With thy deep long-lingering knell.

And at evening evermore,
In a chapel on the shore,
Shall the chaunter, sad and saintly, 75
Yellow tapers burning faintly,
Doleful masses chaunt for thee,
Miserere Domine!

Hark! the cadence dies away
On the quiet moonlight sea: 80
The boatmen rest their oars and say,
Miserere Domine! [A long pause.


[850]


Ordonio. The innocent obey nor charm nor spell!
My brother is in heaven. Thou sainted spirit,
Burst on our sight, a passing visitant! 85
Once more to hear thy voice, once more to see thee,
O 'twere a joy to me!

Alvar. A joy to thee!
What if thou heard'st him now? What if his spirit
Re-enter'd its cold corse, and came upon thee
With many a stab from many a murderer's poniard? 90
What if (his stedfast eye still beaming pity
And brother's love) he turn'd his head aside,
Lest he should look at thee, and with one look
Hurl thee beyond all power of penitence?

Valdez. These are unholy fancies!

Ordonio. Yes, my father, 95
He is in Heaven!

Alvar (still to Ordonio). But what if he had a brother,
Who had lived even so, that at his dying hour,
The name of Heaven would have convulsed his face,
More than the death-pang?

Valdez. Idly prating man!
Thou hast guess'd ill: Don Alvar's only brother 100
Stands here before thee&mdash;a father's blessing on him!
He is most virtuous.

Alvar (still to Ordonio). What, if his very virtues
Had pampered his swoln heart and made him proud?
And what if pride had duped him into guilt?
Yet still he stalked a self-created god, 105
Not very bold, but exquisitely cunning;
And one that at his mother's looking-glass
Would force his features to a frowning sternness?
Young Lord! I tell thee, that there are such beings&mdash;
Yea, and it gives fierce merriment to the damn'd, 110
To see these most proud men, that loath mankind,
At every stir and buzz of coward conscience,
Trick, cant, and lie, most whining hypocrites!
Away, away! Now let me hear more music. [Music again.

Teresa. 'Tis strange, I tremble at my own conjectures! 115
But whatsoe'er it mean, I dare no longer
Be present at these lawless mysteries,
This dark provoking of the hidden Powers!
[851]
Already I affront&mdash;if not high Heaven&mdash;
Yet Alvar's memory!&mdash;Hark! I make appeal 120
Against the unholy rite, and hasten hence
To bend before a lawful shrine, and seek
That voice which whispers, when the still heart listens,
Comfort and faithful hope! Let us retire.

Alvar (to Teresa). O full of faith and guileless love, thy Spirit 125
Still prompts thee wisely. Let the pangs of guilt
Surprise the guilty: thou art innocent!

[Exeunt Teresa and Attendant. Music as before.

The spell is mutter'd&mdash;Come, thou wandering shape,
Who own'st no master in a human eye,
Whate'er be this man's doom, fair be it, or foul, 130
If he be dead, O come! and bring with thee
That which he grasp'd in death! But if he live,
Some token of his obscure perilous life.
[The whole Music dashes into a Chorus.



CHORUS

Wandering demons, hear the spell!
Lest a blacker charm compel&mdash; 135


[The incense on the altar takes fire suddenly, and an illuminated
picture of Alvar's assassination is discovered, and having remained a
few seconds is then hidden by ascending flames.


Ordonio (starting). Duped! duped! duped!&mdash;the traitor Isidore!


[At this instant the doors are forced open, Monviedro and the
Familiars of the Inquisition, Servants, &amp;c., enter and fill the stage.


Monviedro. First seize the sorcerer! suffer him not to speak!
The holy judges of the Inquisition
Shall hear his first words.&mdash;Look you pale, Lord Valdez?
Plain evidence have we here of most foul sorcery. 140
There is a dungeon underneath this castle,
And as you hope for mild interpretation,
Surrender instantly the keys and charge of it.

Ordonio (recovering himself as from stupor, to Servants). Why
haste you not? Off with him to the dungeon!


[All rush out in tumult.

Scene II

Interior of a Chapel, with painted Windows.

Enter Teresa.


Teresa. When first I entered this pure spot, forebodings
Press'd heavy on my heart: but as I knelt,
Such calm unwonted bliss possess'd my spirit,
A trance so cloudless, that those sounds, hard by,
Of trampling uproar fell upon mine ear 5
As alien and unnoticed as the rain-storm
Beats on the roof of some fair banquet-room,
While sweetest melodies are warbling&mdash;&mdash;


Enter Valdez.


Valdez. Ye pitying saints, forgive a father's blindness,
And extricate us from this net of peril! 10

Teresa. Who wakes anew my fears, and speaks of peril?

Valdez. O best Teresa, wisely wert thou prompted!
This was no feat of mortal agency!
That picture&mdash;Oh, that picture tells me all!
With a flash of light it came, in flames it vanished, 15
Self-kindled, self-consum'd: bright as thy life,
Sudden and unexpected as thy fate,
Alvar! My son! My son!&mdash;The Inquisitor&mdash;

Teresa. Torture me not! But Alvar&mdash;Oh of Alvar?

Valdez. How often would he plead for these Morescoes! 20
The brood accurst! remorseless, coward murderers!

Teresa. So? so?&mdash;I comprehend you&mdash;He is&mdash;&mdash;

Valdez. He is no more!

Teresa. O sorrow! that a father's voice should say this,
A Father's Heart believe it!

Valdez. A worse sorrow
Are fancy's wild hopes to a heart despairing! 25

Teresa. These rays that slant in through those gorgeous windows,
From yon bright orb&mdash;though coloured as they pass,
Are they not light?&mdash;Even so that voice, Lord Valdez!
Which whispers to my soul, though haply varied
By many a fancy, many a wishful hope, 30
[853]
Speaks yet the truth: and Alvar lives for me!

Valdez. Yes, for three wasting years, thus and no other,
He has lived for thee&mdash;a spirit for thy spirit!
My child, we must not give religious faith
To every voice which makes the heart a listener 35
To its own wish.

Teresa. I breath'd to the Unerring
Permitted prayers. Must those remain unanswer'd,
Yet impious sorcery, that holds no commune
Save with the lying spirit, claim belief?

Valdez. O not to-day, not now for the first time 40
Was Alvar lost to thee&mdash;
Accurst assassins!
Disarmed, o'erpowered, despairing of defence,
At his bared breast he seem'd to grasp some relique
More dear than was his life&mdash;&mdash;

Teresa. O Heavens! my portrait!
And he did grasp it in his death pang!
Off, false demon, 45
That beat'st thy black wings close above my head![853:1]

[Ordonio enters with the keys of the dungeon in his hand.

Hush! who comes here? The wizard Moor's employer!
Moors were his murderers, you say? Saints shield us
From wicked thoughts&mdash;&mdash;


[Valdez moves towards the back of the stage to meet Ordonio, and during
the concluding lines of Teresa's speech appears as eagerly conversing
with him.


Is Alvar dead? what then?
The nuptial rites and funeral shall be one! 50
Here's no abiding-place for thee, Teresa.&mdash;
Away! they see me not&mdash;Thou seest me, Alvar!
To thee I bend my course.&mdash;But first one question,
One question to Ordonio.&mdash;My limbs tremble&mdash;
There I may sit unmark'd&mdash;a moment will restore me. 55
[Retires out of sight.


[854]


Ordonio (as he advances with Valdez). These are the dungeon keys. Monviedro knew not,
That I too had received the wizard's message,
'He that can bring the dead to life again.'
But now he is satisfied, I plann'd this scheme
To work a full conviction on the culprit, 60
And he entrusts him wholly to my keeping.

Valdez. 'Tis well, my son! But have you yet discovered
(Where is Teresa?) what those speeches meant&mdash;
Pride, and hypocrisy, and guilt, and cunning?
Then when the wizard fix'd his eye on you, 65
And you, I know not why, look'd pale and trembled&mdash;
Why&mdash;why, what ails you now?&mdash;

Ordonio. Me? what ails me?
A pricking of the blood&mdash;It might have happen'd
At any other time.&mdash;Why scan you me?

Valdez. His speech about the corse, and stabs and murderers, 70
Bore reference to the assassins&mdash;&mdash;

Ordonio. Dup'd! dup'd! dup'd!
The traitor, Isidore! [A pause, then wildly.
I tell thee, my dear father!
I am most glad of this.

Valdez. True&mdash;sorcery
Merits its doom; and this perchance may guide us
To the discovery of the murderers. 75
I have their statures and their several faces
So present to me, that but once to meet them
Would be to recognize.

Ordonio. Yes! yes! we recognize them.
I was benumb'd, and staggered up and down
Through darkness without light&mdash;dark&mdash;dark&mdash;dark! 80
My flesh crept chill, my limbs felt manacled
As had a snake coil'd round them!&mdash;Now 'tis sunshine,
And the blood dances freely through its channels! [Then to himself.
This is my virtuous, grateful Isidore!
[Then mimicking Isidore's manner and voice.
'A common trick of gratitude, my lord!' 85
[855]
Old Gratitude! a dagger would dissect
His 'own full heart'&mdash;'twere good to see its colour.

Valdez. These magic sights! O that I ne'er had yielded
To your entreaties! Neither had I yielded,
But that in spite of your own seeming faith 90
I held it for some innocent stratagem,
Which love had prompted, to remove the doubts
Of wild Teresa&mdash;by fancies quelling fancies!

Ordonio. Love! love! and then we hate! and what? and wherefore?
Hatred and love! fancies opposed by fancies! 95
What? if one reptile sting another reptile?
Where is the crime? The goodly face of nature
Hath one disfeaturing stain the less upon it.
Are we not all predestined transiency,
And cold dishonour? Grant it, that this hand 100
Had given a morsel to the hungry worms
Somewhat too early&mdash;Where's the crime of this?
That this must needs bring on the idiotcy
Of moist-eyed penitence&mdash;'tis like a dream!

Valdez. Wild talk, my son! But thy excess of feeling&mdash;&mdash; 105
Almost I fear it hath unhinged his brain.

Ordonio (Teresa reappears and advances slowly). Say, I had laid a body in the sun!
Well! in a month there swarm forth from the corse
A thousand, nay, ten thousand sentient beings
In place of that one man.&mdash;Say, I had kill'd him! 110

[Teresa stops listening.

Yet who shall tell me, that each one and all
Of these ten thousand lives is not as happy,
As that one life, which being push'd aside,
Made room for these unnumbered&mdash;&mdash;

Valdez. O mere madness!


[Teresa moves hastily forwards, and places herself directly before
Ordonio.


Ordonio. Teresa? or the phantom of Teresa? 115


[856]


Teresa. Alas! the phantom only, if in truth
The substance of her being, her life's life,
Have ta'en its flight through Alvar's death-wound&mdash; [A pause.
Where&mdash;
(Even coward murder grants the dead a grave)
O tell me, Valdez!&mdash;answer me, Ordonio! 120
Where lies the corse of my betroth&eacute;d husband?

Ordonio. There, where Ordonio likewise would fain lie!
In the sleep-compelling earth, in unpierc'd darkness![856:1]
For while we live&mdash;
An inward day that never, never sets, 125
Glares round the soul, and mocks the closing eyelids!

Over his rocky grave the fir-grove sighs
A lulling ceaseless dirge! 'Tis well with him.
[Strides off towards the altar, but returns as Valdez is speaking.

Teresa. The rock! the fir-grove! [To Valdez.
Did'st thou hear him say it?
Hush! I will ask him!

Valdez. Urge him not&mdash;not now! 130
This we beheld. Nor he nor I know more,
Than what the magic imagery revealed.
The assassin, who pressed foremost of the three&mdash;&mdash;

Ordonio. A tender-hearted, scrupulous, grateful villain,
Whom I will strangle!

Valdez. While his two companions&mdash;&mdash; 135

Ordonio. Dead! dead already! what care we for the dead?

Valdez (to Teresa). Pity him! soothe him! disenchant his spirit!
[857]
These supernatural shews, this strange disclosure,
And this too fond affection, which still broods
O'er Alvar's fate, and still burns to avenge it&mdash; 140
These, struggling with his hopeless love for you,
Distemper him, and give reality
To the creatures of his fancy.

Ordonio. Is it so?
Yes! yes! even like a child, that too abruptly
Roused by a glare of light from deepest sleep 145
Starts up bewildered and talks idly.
Father!
What if the Moors that made my brother's grave,
Even now were digging ours? What if the bolt,
Though aim'd, I doubt not, at the son of Valdez,
Yet miss'd its true aim when it fell on Alvar? 150

Valdez. Alvar ne'er fought against the Moors,&mdash;say rather,
He was their advocate; but you had march'd
With fire and desolation through their villages.&mdash;
Yet he by chance was captured.

Ordonio. Unknown, perhaps,
Captured, yet as the son of Valdez, murdered. 155
Leave all to me. Nay, whither, gentle lady?

Valdez. What seek you now?

Teresa. A better, surer light
To guide me&mdash;&mdash;

Both Valdez and Ordonio. Whither?

Teresa. To the only place
Where life yet dwells for me, and ease of heart.
These walls seem threatening to fall in upon me! 160
Detain me not! a dim power drives me hence,
And that will be my guide.

Valdez. To find a lover!
Suits that a high-born maiden's modesty?
O folly and shame! Tempt not my rage, Teresa!

Teresa. Hopeless, I fear no human being's rage. 165
And am I hastening to the arms&mdash;&mdash;O Heaven!
I haste but to the grave of my belov'd!
[Exit, Valdez following after her.

Ordonio. This, then, is my reward! and I must love her?
Scorn'd! shudder'd at! yet love her still? yes! yes!
[858]
By the deep feelings of revenge and hate 170
I will still love her&mdash;woo her&mdash;win her too! [A pause.
Isidore safe and silent, and the portrait
Found on the wizard&mdash;he, belike, self-poison'd
To escape the crueller flames&mdash;&mdash;My soul shouts triumph!
The mine is undermined! blood! blood! blood! 175
They thirst for thy blood! thy blood, Ordonio! [A pause.
The hunt is up! and in the midnight wood
With lights to dazzle and with nets they seek
A timid prey: and lo! the tiger's eye
Glares in the red flame of his hunter's torch! 180

To Isidore I will dispatch a message,
And lure him to the cavern! aye, that cavern!
He cannot fail to find it. Thither I'll lure him,
Whence he shall never, never more return!
[Looks through the side window.
A rim of the sun lies yet upon the sea, 185
And now 'tis gone! All shall be done to-night. [Exit.

the Actors and Actresses and even the Mechanics on the stage clustering

ACT IV

Scene I

A cavern, dark, except where a gleam of moonlight is seen on one side
at the further end of it; supposed to be cast on it from a crevice in a
part of the cavern out of sight. Isidore alone, an extinguished torch in
his hand.


Isidore. Faith 'twas a moving letter&mdash;very moving!
'His life in danger, no place safe but this!
'Twas his turn now to talk of gratitude.'
And yet&mdash;but no! there can't be such a villain.
It can not be!
Thanks to that little crevice, 5
Which lets the moonlight in! I'll go and sit by it.
To peep at a tree, or see a he-goat's beard,
Or hear a cow or two breathe loud in their sleep&mdash;
Any thing but this crash of water drops!
These dull abortive sounds that fret the silence 10
With puny thwartings and mock opposition!
[859]
So beats the death-watch to a sick man's ear.

[He goes out of sight, opposite to the patch of moonlight: and
returns.

A hellish pit! The very same I dreamt of!
I was just in&mdash;and those damn'd fingers of ice
Which clutch'd my hair up! Ha!&mdash;what's that&mdash;it mov'd. 15


[Isidore stands staring at another recess in the cavern. In the mean
time Ordonio enters with a torch, and halloes to Isidore.


Isidore. I swear that I saw something moving there!
The moonshine came and went like a flash of lightning&mdash;&mdash;
I swear, I saw it move.

Ordonio (goes into the recess, then returns).
A jutting clay stone
Drops on the long lank weed, that grows beneath:
And the weed nods and drips.[859:1]

Isidore. A jest to laugh at! 20
It was not that which scar'd me, good my lord.

Ordonio. What scar'd you, then?

Isidore. You see that little rift?
But first permit me!

[Lights his torch at Ordonio's, and while lighting it.

(A lighted torch in the hand
Is no unpleasant object here&mdash;one's breath
Floats round the flame, and makes as many colours 25
As the thin clouds that travel near the moon.)
You see that crevice there?
My torch extinguished by these water-drops,
And marking that the moonlight came from thence,
I stept in to it, meaning to sit there; 30
But scarcely had I measured twenty paces&mdash;
My body bending forward, yea, o'erbalanced
Almost beyond recoil, on the dim brink
Of a huge chasm I stept. The shadowy moonshine
Filling the void so counterfeited substance, 35
That my foot hung aslant adown the edge.
[860]
Was it my own fear?
Fear too hath its instincts![860:1]
(And yet such dens as these are wildly told of,
And there are beings that live, yet not for the eye)
An arm of frost above and from behind me 40
Pluck'd up and snatched me backward. Merciful Heaven!
You smile! alas, even smiles look ghastly here!
My lord, I pray you, go yourself and view it.

Ordonio. It must have shot some pleasant feelings through you.

Isidore. If every atom of a dead man's flesh 45
Should creep, each one with a particular life,
Yet all as cold as ever&mdash;'twas just so!
Or had it drizzled needle-points of frost
Upon a feverish head made suddenly bald&mdash;

Ordonio. Why, Isidore,
I blush for thy cowardice. It might have startled, 50
I grant you, even a brave man for a moment&mdash;
But such a panic&mdash;

Isidore. When a boy, my lord!
I could have sate whole hours beside that chasm,
Push'd in huge stones and heard them strike and rattle
Against its horrid sides: then hung my head 55
Low down, and listened till the heavy fragments
Sank with faint crash in that still groaning well,
Which never thirsty pilgrim blest, which never
A living thing came near&mdash;unless, perchance,
Some blind-worm battens on the ropy mould 60
Close at its edge.

Ordonio. Art thou more coward now?

Isidore. Call him, that fears his fellow-man, a coward!
[861]
I fear not man&mdash;but this inhuman cavern,
It were too bad a prison-house for goblins.
Beside, (you'll smile, my lord) but true it is, 65
My last night's sleep was very sorely haunted
By what had passed between us in the morning.
O sleep of horrors! Now run down and stared at
By forms so hideous that they mock remembrance&mdash;
Now seeing nothing and imagining nothing, 70
But only being afraid&mdash;stifled with fear!
While every goodly or familiar form
Had a strange power of breathing terror round me![861:1]
I saw you in a thousand fearful shapes;
And, I entreat your lordship to believe me, 75
In my last dream&mdash;&mdash;

Ordonio. Well?

Isidore. I was in the act
Of falling down that chasm, when Alhadra
Wak'd me: she heard my heart beat.

Ordonio. Strange enough!
Had you been here before?

Isidore. Never, my lord!
But mine eyes do not see it now more clearly, 80
Than in my dream I saw&mdash;that very chasm.

Ordonio (after a pause). I know not why it should be! yet it is&mdash;

Isidore. What is, my lord?

Ordonio. Abhorrent from our nature
To kill a man.&mdash;

Isidore. Except in self-defence.

Ordonio. Why that's my case; and yet the soul recoils from it&mdash; 85
'Tis so with me at least. But you, perhaps,
Have sterner feelings?

Isidore. Something troubles you.
How shall I serve you? By the life you gave me,
By all that makes that life of value to me,
[862]
My wife, my babes, my honour, I swear to you, 90
Name it, and I will toil to do the thing,
If it be innocent! But this, my lord!
Is not a place where you could perpetrate,
No, nor propose a wicked thing. The darkness,
When ten strides off we know 'tis cheerful moonlight, 95
Collects the guilt, and crowds it round the heart.
It must be innocent.

Ordonio. Thyself be judge.
One of our family knew this place well.

Isidore. Who? when? my lord?

Ordonio. What boots it, who or when?
Hang up thy torch&mdash;I'll tell his tale to thee. 100

[They hang up their torches on some ridge in the cavern.

He was a man different from other men,
And he despised them, yet revered himself.

Isidore (aside). He? He despised? Thou'rt speaking of thyself!
I am on my guard, however: no surprise. [Then to Ordonio.
What, he was mad?

Ordonio. All men seemed mad to him! 105
Nature had made him for some other planet,
And pressed his soul into a human shape
By accident or malice. In this world
He found no fit companion.

Isidore. Of himself he speaks. [Aside.
Alas! poor wretch! 110
Mad men are mostly proud.

Ordonio. He walked alone,
And phantom thoughts unsought-for troubled him.
Something within would still be shadowing out
All possibilities; and with these shadows
His mind held dalliance. Once, as so it happened, 115
A fancy crossed him wilder than the rest:
To this in moody murmur and low voice
He yielded utterance, as some talk in sleep:
The man who heard him.&mdash;
Why did'st thou look round?

Isidore. I have a prattler three years old, my lord! 120
[863]
In truth he is my darling. As I went
From forth my door, he made a moan in sleep&mdash;
But I am talking idly&mdash;pray proceed!
And what did this man?

Ordonio. With this human hand
He gave a substance and reality 125
To that wild fancy of a possible thing.&mdash;
Well it was done!
Why babblest thou of guilt?
The deed was done, and it passed fairly off.
And he whose tale I tell thee&mdash;dost thou listen?

Isidore. I would, my lord, you were by my fire-side, 130
I'd listen to you with an eager eye,
Though you began this cloudy tale at midnight,
But I do listen&mdash;pray proceed, my lord.

Ordonio. Where was I?

Isidore. He of whom you tell the tale&mdash;

Ordonio. Surveying all things with a quiet scorn, 135
Tamed himself down to living purposes,
The occupations and the semblances
Of ordinary men&mdash;and such he seemed!
But that same over ready agent&mdash;he&mdash;

Isidore. Ah! what of him, my lord?

Ordonio. He proved a traitor, 140
Betrayed the mystery to a brother-traitor,
And they between them hatch'd a damn&eacute;d plot
To hunt him down to infamy and death.
What did the Valdez? I am proud of the name
Since he dared do it.&mdash;

[Ordonio grasps his sword, and turns off from Isidore, then after a
pause returns.

Our links burn dimly. 145

Isidore. A dark tale darkly finished! Nay, my lord!
Tell what he did.

Ordonio. That which his wisdom prompted&mdash;
He made the traitor meet him in this cavern,
And here he kill'd the traitor.

Isidore. No! the fool! 150
He had not wit enough to be a traitor.
Poor thick-eyed beetle! not to have foreseen
That he who gulled thee with a whimpered lie
[864]
To murder his own brother, would not scruple
To murder thee, if e'er his guilt grew jealous, 155
And he could steal upon thee in the dark!

Ordonio. Thou would'st not then have come, if&mdash;

Isidore. Oh yes, my lord!
I would have met him arm'd, and scar'd the coward.

[Isidore throws off his robe; shews himself armed, and draws his
sword.


Ordonio. Now this is excellent and warms the blood! 160
My heart was drawing back, drawing me back
With weak and womanish scruples. Now my vengeance
Beckons me onwards with a warrior's mien,
And claims that life, my pity robb'd her of&mdash;
Now will I kill thee, thankless slave, and count it 165
Among my comfortable thoughts hereafter.

Isidore. And all my little ones fatherless&mdash;
Die thou first.


[They fight, Ordonio disarms Isidore, and in disarming him throws his
sword up that recess opposite to which they were standing. Isidore
hurries into the recess with his torch, Ordonio follows him; a loud cry
of 'Traitor! Monster!' is heard from the cavern, and in a moment Ordonio
returns alone.


Ordonio. I have hurl'd him down the chasm! treason for treason.
He dreamt of it: henceforward let him sleep,
A dreamless sleep, from which no wife can wake him. 170
His dream too is made out&mdash;Now for his friend. [Exit Ordonio.

Scene II

The interior Court of a Saracenic or Gothic Castle, with the Iron Gate
of a Dungeon visible.


Teresa. Heart-chilling superstition! thou canst glaze
Ev'n pity's eye with her own frozen tear.
In vain I urge the tortures that await him;
[865]
Even Selma, reverend guardian of my childhood,
My second mother, shuts her heart against me! 5
Well, I have won from her what most imports
The present need, this secret of the dungeon
Known only to herself.&mdash;A Moor! a Sorcerer!
No, I have faith, that Nature ne'er permitted
Baseness to wear a form so noble. True, 10
I doubt not that Ordonio had suborned him
To act some part in some unholy fraud;
As little doubt, that for some unknown purpose
He hath baffled his suborner, terror-struck him,
And that Ordonio meditates revenge! 15
But my resolve is fixed! myself will rescue him,
And learn if haply he knew aught of Alvar.


Enter Valdez.


Valdez. Still sad?&mdash;and gazing at the massive door
Of that fell dungeon which thou ne'er had'st sight of,
Save what, perchance, thy infant fancy shap'd it 20
When the nurse still'd thy cries with unmeant threats.
Now by my faith, girl! this same wizard haunts thee!
A stately man, and eloquent and tender&mdash;
Who then need wonder if a lady sighs
Even at the thought of what these stern Dominicans&mdash; 25

Teresa. The horror of their ghastly punishments
Doth so o'ertop the height of all compassion,
That I should feel too little for mine enemy,
If it were possible I could feel more,
Even though the dearest inmates of our household 30
Were doom'd to suffer them. That such things are&mdash;

Valdez. Hush, thoughtless woman!

Teresa. Nay, it wakes within me
More than a woman's spirit.

Valdez. No more of this&mdash;
What if Monviedro or his creatures hear us!
I dare not listen to you.

Teresa. My honoured lord, 35
These were my Alvar's lessons, and whene'er
I bend me o'er his portrait, I repeat them,
As if to give a voice to the mute image.


[866]


Valdez. &mdash;&mdash;We have mourned for Alvar.
Of his sad fate there now remains no doubt. 40
Have I no other son?

Teresa. Speak not of him!
That low imposture! That mysterious picture!
If this be madness, must I wed a madman?
And if not madness, there is mystery,
And guilt doth lurk behind it.

Valdez. Is this well? 45

Teresa. Yes, it is truth: saw you his countenance?
How rage, remorse, and scorn, and stupid fear
Displaced each other with swift interchanges?
O that I had indeed the sorcerer's power.&mdash;&mdash;
I would call up before thine eyes the image 50
Of my betrothed Alvar, of thy first-born![866:1]
His own fair countenance, his kingly forehead,
His tender smiles, love's day-dawn on his lips!
That spiritual and almost heavenly light
In his commanding eye&mdash;his mien heroic, 55
Virtue's own native heraldry! to man
Genial, and pleasant to his guardian angel.
Whene'er he gladden'd, how the gladness spread
Wide round him! and when oft with swelling tears,
Flash'd through by indignation, he bewail'd 60
The wrongs of Belgium's martyr'd patriots,
Oh, what a grief was there&mdash;for joy to envy,
Or gaze upon enamour'd!
O my father!
Recall that morning when we knelt together,
And thou didst bless our loves! O even now, 65
Even now, my sire! to thy mind's eye present him,
As at that moment he rose up before thee,
Stately, with beaming look! Place, place beside him
Ordonio's dark perturb&eacute;d countenance!
Then bid me (Oh thou could'st not) bid me turn 70
From him, the joy, the triumph of our kind!
To take in exchange that brooding man, who never
Lifts up his eye from the earth, unless to scowl.

Valdez. Ungrateful woman! I have tried to stifle
An old man's passion! was it not enough, 75
That thou hast made my son a restless man,
[867]
Banish'd his health, and half unhing'd his reason;
But that thou wilt insult him with suspicion?
And toil to blast his honour? I am old,
A comfortless old man!

Teresa. O grief! to hear 80
Hateful entreaties from a voice we love!


Enter a Peasant and presents a letter to Valdez.


Valdez (reading it). 'He dares not venture hither!' Why, what can this mean?
'Lest the Familiars of the Inquisition,
That watch around my gates, should intercept him;
But he conjures me, that without delay 85
I hasten to him&mdash;for my own sake entreats me
To guard from danger him I hold imprison'd&mdash;
He will reveal a secret, the joy of which
Will even outweigh the sorrow.'&mdash;Why what can this be?
Perchance it is some Moorish stratagem, 90
To have in me a hostage for his safety.
Nay, that they dare not! Ho! collect my servants!
I will go thither&mdash;let them arm themselves. [Exit Valdez.

Teresa (alone). The moon is high in heaven, and all is hush'd.
Yet anxious listener! I have seem'd to hear 95
A low dead thunder mutter thro' the night,
As 'twere a giant angry in his sleep.
O Alvar! Alvar! that they could return,
Those blessed days that imitated heaven,
When we two wont to walk at eventide; 100
When we saw nought but beauty; when we heard
The voice of that Almighty One who loved us
In every gale that breathed, and wave that murmur'd!
O we have listen'd, even till high-wrought pleasure
Hath half assumed the countenance of grief, 105
And the deep sigh seemed to heave up a weight
Of bliss, that pressed too heavy on the heart. [A pause.
And this majestic Moor, seems he not one
Who oft and long communing with my Alvar
Hath drunk in kindred lustre from his presence, 110
And guides me to him with reflected light?
What if in yon dark dungeon coward treachery
Be groping for him with envenomed poniard&mdash;
Hence, womanish fears, traitors to love and duty&mdash;
I'll free him. [Exit Teresa.

Scene III

The mountains by moonlight. Alhadra alone in a Moorish dress.


Alhadra. Yon hanging woods, that touch'd by autumn seem
As they were blossoming hues of fire and gold
The flower-like woods, most lovely in decay,
The many clouds, the sea, the rock, the sands.
Lie in the silent moonshine: and the owl, 5
(Strange! very strange!) the screech-owl only wakes!
Sole voice, sole eye of all this world of beauty!
Unless, perhaps, she sing her screeching song
To a herd of wolves, that skulk athirst for blood.
Why such a thing am I?&mdash;Where are these men? 10
I need the sympathy of human faces,
To beat away this deep contempt for all things,
Which quenches my revenge. O! would to Alla,
The raven, or the sea-mew, were appointed
To bring me food! or rather that my soul 15
Could drink in life from the universal air!
It were a lot divine in some small skiff
Along some Ocean's boundless solitude,
To float for ever with a careless course.
And think myself the only being alive! 20

My children!&mdash;Isidore's children!&mdash;Son of Valdez,
This hath new strung mine arm. Thou coward tyrant!
To stupify a woman's heart with anguish
Till she forgot&mdash;even that she was a mother!


[She fixes her eye on the earth. Then drop in one after another, from
different parts of the stage, a considerable number of Morescoes, all
in Moorish garments and Moorish armour. They form a circle at a distance
round Alhadra, and remain silent till Naomi enters.

[869]


Naomi. Woman! May Alla and the Prophet bless thee! 25
We have obeyed thy call. Where is our chief?
And why didst thou enjoin these Moorish garments?

Alhadra (raising her eyes, and looking round on the circle). Warriors of Mahomet! faithful in the battle!
My countrymen! Come ye prepared to work
An honourable deed? And would ye work it 30
In the slave's garb? Curse on those Christian robes!
They are spell-blasted: and whoever wears them,
His arm shrinks wither'd, his heart melts away,
And his bones soften.

Naomi. Where is Isidore?

Alhadra. This night I went from forth my house, and left 35
His children all asleep: and he was living!
And I return'd and found them still asleep,
But he had perished&mdash;&mdash;

All Morescoes. Perished?

Alhadra. He had perished!
Sleep on, poor babes! not one of you doth know
That he is fatherless&mdash;a desolate orphan! 40
Why should we wake them? Can an infant's arm
Revenge his murder?

One Moresco (to another). Did she say his murder?

Naomi. Murder? Not murdered?

Alhadra. Murdered by a Christian!


[They all at once draw their sabres.


Alhadra (to Naomi, who advances from the circle). Brother of Zagri! fling away thy sword;
This is thy chieftain's! [He steps forward to take it.
Dost thou dare receive it? 45
For I have sworn by Alla and the Prophet,
No tear shall dim these eyes, this woman's heart
Shall heave no groan, till I have seen that sword
Wet with the life-blood of the son of Valdez!        [A pause.
Ordonio was your chieftain's murderer! 50

Naomi. He dies, by Alla!

All (kneeling). By Alla!

Alhadra. This night your chieftain armed himself,
And hurried from me. But I followed him
At distance, till I saw him enter&mdash;there!


[870]


Naomi. The cavern?

Alhadra. Yes, the mouth of yonder cavern 55
After a while I saw the son of Valdez
Rush by with flaring torch; he likewise entered.
There was another and a longer pause;
And once, methought I heard the clash of swords!
And soon the son of Valdez re-appeared: 60
He flung his torch towards the moon in sport,
And seemed as he were mirthful! I stood listening,
Impatient for the footsteps of my husband!

Naomi. Thou called'st him?

Alhadra. I crept into the cavern&mdash;
'Twas dark and very silent.
What said'st thou? 65
No! no! I did not dare call, Isidore,
Lest I should hear no answer! A brief while,
Belike, I lost all thought and memory
Of that for which I came! After that pause,
O Heaven! I heard a groan, and followed it: 70
And yet another groan, which guided me
Into a strange recess&mdash;and there was light,
A hideous light! his torch lay on the ground;
Its flame burnt dimly o'er a chasm's brink:
I spake; and whilst I spake, a feeble groan 75
Came from that chasm! it was his last! his death-groan!

Naomi. Comfort her, Alla!

Alhadra. I stood in unimaginable trance
And agony that cannot be remembered,
Listening with horrid hope to hear a groan! 80
But I had heard his last: my husband's death-groan!

Naomi. Haste! let us onward.

Alhadra. I looked far down the pit&mdash;
My sight was bounded by a jutting fragment:
And it was stained with blood. Then first I shrieked,
My eye-balls burnt, my brain grew hot as fire, 85
And all the hanging drops of the wet roof
Turned into blood&mdash;I saw them turn to blood!
And I was leaping wildly down the chasm,
When on the farther brink I saw his sword,
And it said, Vengeance!&mdash;Curses on my tongue! 90
[871]The moon hath moved in Heaven, and I am here,
And he hath not had vengeance! Isidore!
Spirit of Isidore! thy murderer lives!
Away! away!

All. Away! away!


[She rushes off, all following her.

ACT V

Scene I

A Dungeon.

Alvar (alone) rises slowly from a bed of reeds.


Alvar. And this place my forefathers made for man!
This is the process of our love and wisdom
To each poor brother who offends against us&mdash;
Most innocent, perhaps&mdash;and what if guilty?
Is this the only cure? Merciful God! 5
Each pore and natural outlet shrivelled up
By ignorance and parching poverty,
His energies roll back upon his heart,
And stagnate and corrupt, till, chang'd to poison,
They break out on him, like a loathsome plague-spot! 10
Then we call in our pampered mountebanks:
And this is their best cure! uncomforted
And friendless solitude, groaning and tears,
And savage faces, at the clanking hour,
Seen through the steam and vapours of his dungeon 15
By the lamp's dismal twilight! So he lies
Circled with evil, till his very soul
Unmoulds its essence, hopelessly deformed
By sights of evermore deformity!
With other ministrations thou, O Nature! 20
Healest thy wandering and distempered child:
Thou pourest on him thy soft influences,
Thy sunny hues, fair forms, and breathing sweets;
Thy melodies of woods, and winds, and waters!
Till he relent, and can no more endure 25
To be a jarring and a dissonant thing
Amid this general dance and minstrelsy;
But, bursting into tears, wins back his way,
[872]
His angry spirit healed and harmonized
By the benignant touch of love and beauty. 30

I am chill and weary! Yon rude bench of stone,
In that dark angle, the sole resting-place!
But the self-approving mind is its own light
And life's best warmth still radiates from the heart
Where love sits brooding, and an honest purpose. 35
[Retires out of sight.


Enter Teresa with a taper.


Teresa. It has chilled my very life&mdash;&mdash;my own voice scares me;
Yet when I hear it not I seem to lose
The substance of my being&mdash;my strongest grasp
Sends inwards but weak witness that I am.
I seek to cheat the echo.&mdash;How the half sounds 40
Blend with this strangled light! Is he not here&mdash; [Looking round.
O for one human face here&mdash;but to see
One human face here to sustain me.&mdash;Courage!
It is but my own fear! The life within me,
It sinks and wavers like this cone of flame, 45
Beyond which I scarce dare look onward! Oh!
If I faint? If this inhuman den should be
At once my death-bed and my burial vault?
[Faintly screams as Alvar emerges from the recess.

Alvar (rushes towards her, and catches her as she is falling).
O gracious heaven! it is, it is Teresa!
Shall I reveal myself? The sudden shock 50
Of rapture will blow out this spark of life,
And joy complete what terror has begun.
O ye impetuous beatings here, be still!
Teresa, best beloved! pale, pale, and cold!
Her pulse doth flutter! Teresa! my Teresa! 55

Teresa (recovering). I heard a voice; but often in my dreams
I hear that voice! and wake and try&mdash;and try&mdash;
To hear it waking! but I never could&mdash;
And 'tis so now&mdash;even so! Well! he is dead&mdash;
[873]
Murdered perhaps! and I am faint, and feel 60
As if it were no painful thing to die!

Alvar. Believe it not, sweet maid! Believe it not,
Belov&eacute;d woman! 'Twas a low imposture
Framed by a guilty wretch.

Teresa. Ha! Who art thou?

Alvar. Suborned by his brother&mdash;

Teresa. Didst thou murder him? 65
And dost thou now repent? Poor troubled man,
I do forgive thee, and may Heaven forgive thee!

Alvar. Ordonio&mdash;he&mdash;

Teresa. If thou didst murder him&mdash;
His spirit ever at the throne of God
Asks mercy for thee: prays for mercy for thee, 70
With tears in Heaven!

Alvar. Alvar was not murdered.
Be calm! Be calm, sweet maid!

Teresa. Nay, nay, but tell me! [A pause.
O 'tis lost again!
This dull confus&eacute;d pain&mdash; [A pause.
Mysterious man!
Methinks I can not fear thee: for thine eye 75
Doth swim with love and pity&mdash;Well! Ordonio&mdash;
Oh my foreboding heart! And he suborned thee,
And thou didst spare his life? Blessings shower on thee,
As many as the drops twice counted o'er
In the fond faithful heart of his Teresa! 80

Alvar. I can endure no more. The Moorish sorcerer
Exists but in the stain upon his face.
That picture&mdash;

Teresa. Ha! speak on!

Alvar. Beloved Teresa!
It told but half the truth. O let this portrait
[874]
Tell all&mdash;that Alvar lives&mdash;that he is here! 85
Thy much deceived but ever faithful Alvar. [Takes her portrait from his neck, and gives it her.

Teresa (receiving the portrait). The same&mdash;it is the same! Ah! Who art thou?
Nay, I will call thee, Alvar! [She falls on his neck.

Alvar. O joy unutterable!
But hark! a sound as of removing bars
At the dungeon's outer door. A brief, brief while 90
Conceal thyself, my love! It is Ordonio.
For the honour of our race, for our dear father;
O for himself too (he is still my brother)
Let me recall him to his nobler nature,
That he may wake as from a dream of murder! 95
O let me reconcile him to himself,
Open the sacred source of penitent tears,
And be once more his own beloved Alvar.

Teresa. O my all virtuous love! I fear to leave thee
With that obdurate man.

Alvar. Thou dost not leave me! 100
But a brief while retire into the darkness:
O that my joy could spread its sunshine round thee!

Teresa. The sound of thy voice shall be my music!
Alvar! my Alvar! am I sure I hold thee?
Is it no dream? thee in my arms, my Alvar! [Exit. 105


[A noise at the Dungeon door. It opens, and Ordonio enters, with a
goblet in his hand.


Ordonio. Hail, potent wizard! in my gayer mood
I poured forth a libation to old Pluto,
And as I brimmed the bowl, I thought on thee.
Thou hast conspired against my life and honour,
Hast tricked me foully; yet I hate thee not. 110
Why should I hate thee? this same world of ours,
'Tis but a pool amid a storm of rain,
And we the air-bladders that course up and down,
And joust and tilt in merry tournament;
And when one bubble runs foul of another, 115
The weaker needs must break.

Alvar. I see thy heart!
[875]
There is a frightful glitter in thine eye
Which doth betray thee. Inly-tortured man,
This is the revelry of a drunken anguish,
Which fain would scoff away the pang of guilt, 120
And quell each human feeling.

Ordonio. Feeling! feeling!
The death of a man&mdash;the breaking of a bubble&mdash;
'Tis true I cannot sob for such misfortunes;
But faintness, cold and hunger&mdash;curses on me
If willingly I e'er inflicted them! 125
Come, take the beverage; this chill place demands it.
[Ordonio proffers the goblet.

Alvar. Yon insect on the wall,
Which moves this way and that its hundred limbs,
Were it a toy of mere mechanic craft,
It were an infinitely curious thing! 130
But it has life, Ordonio! life, enjoyment!
And by the power of its miraculous will
Wields all the complex movements of its frame
Unerringly to pleasurable ends!
Saw I that insect on this goblet's brim 135
I would remove it with an anxious pity!

Ordonio. What meanest thou?

Alvar. There's poison in the wine.

Ordonio. Thou hast guessed right; there's poison in the wine.
There's poison in't&mdash;which of us two shall drink it?
For one of us must die!

Alvar. Whom dost thou think me? 140

Ordonio. The accomplice and sworn friend of Isidore.

Alvar. I know him not.
And yet methinks, I have heard the name but lately.
Means he the husband of the Moorish woman?
Isidore? Isidore? 145

Ordonio. Good! good! that lie! by heaven it has restored me.
Now I am thy master!&mdash;Villain! thou shalt drink it,
Or die a bitterer death.

Alvar. What strange solution
Hast thou found out to satisfy thy fears,
And drug them to unnatural sleep? [Alvar takes the goblet, and throws it to the ground.
My master! 150


[876]


Ordonio. Thou mountebank!

Alvar. Mountebank and villain!
What then art thou? For shame, put up thy sword!
What boots a weapon in a withered arm?
I fix mine eye upon thee, and thou tremblest!
I speak, and fear and wonder crush thy rage, 155
And turn it to a motionless distraction!
Thou blind self-worshipper! thy pride, thy cunning,
Thy faith in universal villainy,
Thy shallow sophisms, thy pretended scorn
For all thy human brethren&mdash;out upon them! 160
What have they done for thee? have they given thee peace?
Cured thee of starting in thy sleep? or made
The darkness pleasant when thou wak'st at midnight?
Art happy when alone? Can'st walk by thyself
With even step and quiet cheerfulness? 165
Yet, yet thou may'st be saved&mdash;&mdash;

Ordonio. Saved? saved?

Alvar. One pang!
Could I call up one pang of true remorse!

Ordonio. He told me of the babes that prattled to him.
His fatherless little ones! remorse! remorse!
Where got'st thou that fool's word? Curse on remorse! 170
Can it give up the dead, or recompact
A mangled body? mangled&mdash;dashed to atoms!
Not all the blessings of a host of angels
Can blow away a desolate widow's curse!
And though thou spill thy heart's blood for atonement, 175
It will not weigh against an orphan's tear!

Alvar. But Alvar&mdash;&mdash;

Ordonio. Ha! it chokes thee in the throat,
Even thee; and yet I pray thee speak it out.
Still Alvar!&mdash;Alvar!&mdash;howl it in mine ear!
Heap it like coals of fire upon my heart, 180
And shoot it hissing through my brain!

Alvar. Alas!
That day when thou didst leap from off the rock
Into the waves, and grasped thy sinking brother,
And bore him to the strand; then, son of Valdez,
How sweet and musical the name of Alvar! 185
Then, then, Ordonio, he was dear to thee,
[877]
And thou wert dear to him: heaven only knows
How very dear thou wert! Why did'st thou hate him!
O heaven! how he would fall upon thy neck,
And weep forgiveness!

Ordonio. Spirit of the dead! 190
Methinks I know thee! ha! my brain turns wild
At its own dreams!&mdash;off&mdash;off, fantastic shadow!

Alvar. I fain would tell thee what I am, but dare not!

Ordonio. Cheat! villain! traitor! whatsoever thou be&mdash;
I fear thee, man!

Teresa (rushing out and falling on Alvar's neck). Ordonio!
'tis thy brother! 195


[Ordonio runs upon Alvar with his sword. Teresa flings herself on
Ordonio and arrests his arm.


Stop, madman, stop!

Alvar. Does then this thin disguise impenetrably
Hide Alvar from thee? Toil and painful wounds
And long imprisonment in unwholesome dungeons,
Have marred perhaps all trait and lineament 200
Of what I was! But chiefly, chiefly, brother,
My anguish for thy guilt!
Ordonio&mdash;Brother!
Nay, nay, thou shalt embrace me.

Ordonio (drawing back, and gazing at Alvar). Touch me not!
Touch not pollution, Alvar! I will die.
[He attempts to fall on his sword, Alvar and Teresa prevent him.

Alvar. We will find means to save your honour. Live, 205
Oh live, Ordonio! for our father's sake!
Spare his grey hairs!

Teresa. And you may yet be happy.

Ordonio. O horror! not a thousand years in heaven
Could recompose this miserable heart,
Or make it capable of one brief joy! 210
Live! live! Why yes! 'Twere well to live with you:
For is it fit a villain should be proud?
My brother! I will kneel to you, my brother! [Kneeling.
Forgive me, Alvar!&mdash;&mdash;Curse me with forgiveness!


[878]


Alvar. Call back thy soul, Ordonio, and look round thee! 215
Now is the time for greatness! Think that heaven&mdash;

Teresa. O mark his eye! he hears not what you say.

Ordonio. Yes, mark his eye! there's fascination in it!
Thou said'st thou did'st not know him&mdash;That is he!
He comes upon me!

Alvar. Heal, O heal him, heaven! 220

Ordonio. Nearer and nearer! and I can not stir!
Will no one hear these stifled groans, and wake me?
He would have died to save me, and I killed him&mdash;
A husband and a father!&mdash;

Teresa. Some secret poison
Drinks up his spirits!

Ordonio. Let the eternal justice 225
Prepare my punishment in the obscure world&mdash;
I will not bear to live&mdash;to live&mdash;O agony!
And be myself alone my own sore torment!


[The doors of the dungeon are broken open, and in rush Alhadra, and the
band of Morescoes.


Alhadra. Seize first that man!


[Alvar presses onward to defend Ordonio.


Ordonio. Off, ruffians! I have flung away my sword. 230
Woman, my life is thine! to thee I give it!
Off! he that touches me with his hand of flesh,
I'll rend his limbs asunder! I have strength
With this bare arm to scatter you like ashes.

Alhadra. My husband&mdash;

Ordonio. Yes, I murdered him most foully. 235

Alvar and Teresa. O horrible!

Alhadra. Why did'st thou leave his children?
Demon, thou should'st have sent thy dogs of hell
To lap their blood. Then, then I might have hardened
My soul in misery, and have had comfort.
I would have stood far off, quiet though dark, 240
And bade the race of men raise up a mourning
For a deep horror of desolation,
Too great to be one soul's particular lot!
Brother of Zagri! let me lean upon thee.
The time is not yet come for woman's anguish, 245
[879]
I have not seen his blood&mdash;Within an hour
Those little ones will crowd around and ask me,
Where is our father? I shall curse thee then!
Wert thou in heaven, my curse would pluck thee thence!

Teresa. He doth repent! See, see, I kneel to thee! 250
O let him live! That ag&eacute;d man, his father&mdash;&mdash;

Alhadra. Why had he such a son?

[Shouts from the distance of Rescue! Rescue! Alvar! Alvar! and the
voice of Valdez heard.

Rescue?&mdash;and Isidore's spirit unavenged?&mdash;
The deed be mine! [Suddenly stabs Ordonio.
Now take my life!

Ordonio (staggering from the wound). Atonement!

Alvar (while with Teresa supporting Ordonio). Arm of avenging Heaven 255
[880]
Thou hast snatched from me my most cherished hope&mdash;
But go! my word was pledged to thee.

Ordonio. Away!
Brave not my Father's rage! I thank thee! Thou&mdash;
[Then turning his eyes languidly to Alvar.
She hath avenged the blood of Isidore!
I stood in silence like a slave before her 260
That I might taste the wormwood and the gall,
And satiate this self-accusing heart
With bitterer agonies than death can give.
Forgive me, Alvar!
Oh!&mdash;could'st thou forget me! [Dies.


[Alvar and Teresa bend over the body of Ordonio.


Alhadra (to the Moors). I thank thee, Heaven! thou hast ordained it wisely, 265
That still extremes bring their own cure. That point
In misery, which makes the oppressed Man
Regardless of his own life, makes him too
Lord of the Oppressor's&mdash;Knew I a hundred men
Despairing, but not palsied by despair, 270
This arm should shake the kingdoms of the world;
The deep foundations of iniquity
Should sink away, earth groaning from beneath them;
The strongholds of the cruel men should fall,
Their temples and their mountainous towers should fall; 275
Till desolation seemed a beautiful thing,
And all that were and had the spirit of life,
Sang a new song to her who had gone forth,
Conquering and still to conquer!


[Alhadra hurries off with the Moors; the stage fills with armed
Peasants, and Servants, Zulimez and Valdez at their head. Valdez
rushes into Alvar's arms.


Alvar. Turn not thy face that way, my father! hide, 280
Oh hide it from his eye! Oh let thy joy
Flow in unmingled stream through thy first blessing. [Both kneel to Valdez.

Valdez. My Son! My Alvar! bless, Oh bless him, heaven!

[881]

Teresa. Me too, my Father?

Valdez. Bless, Oh bless my children! [Both rise.

Alvar. Delights so full, if unalloyed with grief, 285
Were ominous. In these strange dread events
Just Heaven instructs us with an awful voice,
That Conscience rules us e'en against our choice.
Our inward Monitress to guide or warn,
If listened to; but if repelled with scorn, 290
At length as dire Remorse, she reappears,
Works in our guilty hopes, and selfish fears!
Still bids, Remember! and still cries, Too late!
And while she scares us, goads us to our fate.

APPENDIX

The following Scene, as unfit for the stage, was taken from the tragedy,
in the year 1797, and published in the Lyrical Ballads. [1798, pp.
28-31: vide ante, pp. 182-4.]

Enter Teresa and Selma.


Teresa. 'Tis said, he spake of you familiarly,
As mine and Alvar's common foster-mother.

Selma. Now blessings on the man, whoe'er he be
That joined your names with mine! O my sweet Lady,
As often as I think of those dear times, 5
When you two little ones would stand, at eve,
On each side of my chair, and make me learn
All you had learnt in the day; and how to talk
In gentle phrase; then bid me sing to you&mdash;&mdash;
'Tis more like heaven to come, than what has been! 10

Teresa. But that entrance, Selma?

Selma. Can no one hear? It is a perilous tale!

Teresa. No one.

Selma. My husband's father told it me,
Poor old Sesina&mdash;angels rest his soul;
He was a woodman, and could fell and saw
With lusty arm. You know that huge round beam 15
Which props the hanging wall of the old chapel?
Beneath that tree, while yet it was a tree,
He found a baby wrapt in mosses, lined
With thistle-beards, and such small locks of wool
As hang on brambles. Well, he brought him home, 20
And reared him at the then Lord Valdez' cost.
And so the babe grew up a pretty boy,
[882]
A pretty boy, but most unteachable&mdash;&mdash;
And never learn'd a prayer, nor told a bead,
But knew the names of birds, and mocked their notes, 25
And whistled, as he were a bird himself.
And all the autumn 'twas his only play
To gather seeds of wild flowers, and to plant them
With earth and water on the stumps of trees.
A Friar, who gathered simples in the wood, 30
A grey-haired man, he loved this little boy:
The boy loved him, and, when the friar taught him,
He soon could write with the pen; and from that time
Lived chiefly at the convent or the castle.
So he became a rare and learned youth: 35
But O! poor wretch! he read, and read, and read,
Till his brain turned; and ere his twentieth year
He had unlawful thoughts of many things:
And though he prayed, he never loved to pray
With holy men, nor in a holy place. 40
But yet his speech, it was so soft and sweet,
The late Lord Valdez ne'er was wearied with him.
And once, as by the north side of the chapel
They stood together chained in deep discourse,
The earth heaved under them with such a groan, 45
That the wall tottered, and had well nigh fallen
Right on their heads. My Lord was sorely frightened;
A fever seized him, and he made confession
Of all the heretical and lawless talk
Which brought this judgment: so the youth was seized, 50
And cast into that hole. My husband's father
Sobbed like a child&mdash;it almost broke his heart:
And once he was working near this dungeon,
He heard a voice distinctly; 'twas the youth's,
Who sung a doleful song about green fields, 55
How sweet it were on lake or wide savanna
To hunt for food, and be a naked man,
And wander up and down at liberty.
He always doted on the youth, and now
His love grew desperate; and defying death, 60
He made that cunning entrance I described,
And the young man escaped.

Teresa. 'Tis a sweet tale:
Such as would lull a listening child to sleep,
His rosy face besoiled with unwiped tears.
[883]
And what became of him?

Selma. He went on shipboard 65
With those bold voyagers who made discovery
Of golden lands. Sesina's younger brother
Went likewise, and when he returned to Spain,
He told Sesina, that the poor mad youth,
Soon after they arrived in that new world, 70
In spite of his dissuasion, seized a boat,
And all alone set sail by silent moonlight
Up a great river, great as any sea,
And ne'er was heard of more: but 'tis supposed,
He lived and died among the savage men. 75

ADVERTISEMENT

The form of the following dramatic poem is in humble imitation of the
Winter's Tale of Shakspeare, except that I have called the first part
a Prelude instead of a first Act, as a somewhat nearer resemblance to
the plan of the ancients, of which one specimen is left us in the
&AElig;schylean Trilogy of the Agamemnon, the Orestes, and the
Eumenides. Though a matter of form merely, yet two plays, on different
periods of the same tale, might seem less bold, than an interval of
twenty years between a first and second act. This is, however, in mere
obedience to custom. The effect does not, in reality, at all depend on
the Time of the interval; but on a very different principle. There are
cases in which an interval of twenty hours between the acts would have a
worse effect (i. e. render the imagination less disposed to take the
position required) than twenty years in other cases. For the rest, I
shall be well content if my readers will take it up, read and judge it,
as a Christmas tale.

PART I

THE PRELUDE, ENTITLED 'THE USURPER'S FORTUNE'


CHARACTERS


Emerick, Usurping King of Illyria.

Raab Kiuprili, an Illyrian Chieftain.

Casimir, Son of Kiuprili.

Chef Ragozzi, a Military Commander.

Zapolya, Queen of Illyria.



Scene I

Front of the Palace with a magnificent Colonnade. On one side a
military Guard-house. Sentries pacing backward and forward before the
Palace. Chef Ragozzi, at the door of the Guard-house, as looking
forwards at some object in the distance.


Chef Ragozzi. My eyes deceive me not, it must be he.
Who but our chief, my more than father, who
But Raab Kiuprili moves with such a gait?
Lo! e'en this eager and unwonted haste
But agitates, not quells, its majesty. 5
My patron! my commander! yes, 'tis he!
Call out the guards. The Lord Kiuprili comes.
[Drums beat, &amp;c., the Guard turns out.


Enter Raab Kiuprili.


Raab Kiuprili (making a signal to stop the drums, &amp;c.). Silence! enough! This is no time, young friend,
For ceremonious dues. The summoning drum,
Th' air-shattering trumpet, and the horseman's clatter, 10
Are insults to a dying sovereign's ear.
Soldiers, 'tis well! Retire! your General greets you,
His loyal fellow-warriors. [Guards retire.

Chef Ragozzi. Pardon my surprise.
Thus sudden from the camp, and unattended!
What may these wonders prophesy?

Raab Kiuprili. Tell me first, 15
How fares the king? His majesty still lives?

Chef Ragozzi. We know no otherwise; but Emerick's friends
(And none but they approach him) scoff at hope.

Raab Kiuprili. Ragozzi! I have reared thee from a child,
[885]
And as a child I have reared thee. Whence this air 20
Of mystery? That face was wont to open
Clear as the morning to me, shewing all things.
Hide nothing from me.

Chef Ragozzi. O most loved, most honoured,
The mystery that struggles in my looks
Betrayed my whole tale to thee, if it told thee 25
That I am ignorant; but fear the worst.
And mystery is contagious. All things here
Are full of motion: and yet all is silent:
And bad men's hopes infect the good with fears.

Raab Kiuprili. I have trembling proof within how true thou speakest. 30

Chef Ragozzi. That the prince Emerick feasts the soldiery,
Gives splendid arms, pays the commanders' debts,
And (it is whispered) by sworn promises
Makes himself debtor&mdash;hearing this, thou hast heard
All&mdash;&mdash; 35
But what my lord will learn too soon himself.

Raab Kiuprili. Ha!&mdash;Well then, let it come! Worse scarce can come.
This letter written by the trembling hand
Of royal Andreas calls me from the camp
To his immediate presence. It appoints me, 40
The Queen, and Emerick, guardians of the realm,
And of the royal infant. Day by day,
Robbed of Zapolya's soothing cares, the king
Yearns only to behold one precious boon,
And with his life breathe forth a father's blessing. 45

Chef Ragozzi. Remember you, my lord! that Hebrew leech
Whose face so much distempered you?

Raab Kiuprili. Barzoni?
I held him for a spy; but the proof failing
(More courteously, I own, than pleased myself),
I sent him from the camp.

Chef Ragozzi. To him, in chief, 50
Prince Emerick trusts his royal brother's health.

Raab Kiuprili. Hide nothing, I conjure you! What of him?


[886]


Chef Ragozzi. With pomp of words beyond a soldier's cunning,
And shrugs and wrinkled brow, he smiles and whispers!
Talks in dark words of women's fancies; hints 55
That 'twere a useless and a cruel zeal
To rob a dying man of any hope,
However vain, that soothes him: and, in fine,
Denies all chance of offspring from the Queen.

Raab Kiuprili. The venomous snake! My heel was on its head, 60
And (fool!) I did not crush it!

Chef Ragozzi. Nay, he fears
Zapolya will not long survive her husband.

Raab Kiuprili. Manifest treason! Even this brief delay
Half makes me an accomplice&mdash;&mdash;(If he live,) [Is moving toward the palace.
If he but live and know me, all may&mdash;&mdash;

Chef Ragozzi. Halt! [Stops him. 65
On pain of death, my Lord! am I commanded
To stop all ingress to the palace.

Raab Kiuprili. Thou!

Chef Ragozzi. No place, no name, no rank excepted&mdash;

Raab Kiuprili. Thou!

Chef Ragozzi. This life of mine, O take it, Lord Kiuprili!
I give it as a weapon to thy hands, 70
Mine own no longer. Guardian of Illyria,
Useless to thee, 'tis worthless to myself.
Thou art the framer of my nobler being;
Nor does there live one virtue in my soul,
One honourable hope, but calls thee father. 75
Yet ere thou dost resolve, know that yon palace
Is guarded from within, that each access
Is thronged by armed conspirators, watched by ruffians
Pampered with gifts, and hot upon the spoil
Which that false promiser still trails before them. 80
I ask but this one boon&mdash;reserve my life
Till I can lose it for the realm and thee!

Raab Kiuprili. My heart is rent asunder. O my country,
O fallen Illyria, stand I here spell-bound?
Did my King love me? Did I earn his love? 85
Have we embraced as brothers would embrace?
Was I his arm, his thunder-bolt? And now
Must I, hag-ridden, pant as in a dream?
[887]
Or, like an eagle, whose strong wings press up
Against a coiling serpent's folds, can I 90
Strike but for mockery, and with restless beak
Gore my own breast?&mdash;Ragozzi, thou art faithful?

Chef Ragozzi. Here before Heaven I dedicate my faith
To the royal line of Andreas.

Raab Kiuprili. Hark, Ragozzi!
Guilt is a timorous thing ere perpetration: 95
Despair alone makes wicked men be bold.
Come thou with me! They have heard my voice in flight,
Have faced round, terror-struck, and feared no longer
The whistling javelins of their fell pursuers.
Ha! what is this?

[Black flag displayed from the Tower of the Palace: a death-bell tolls,
&amp;c.

Vengeance of Heaven! He is dead. 100

Chef Ragozzi. At length then 'tis announced. Alas! I fear,
That these black death-flags are but treason's signals.

Raab Kiuprili. A prophecy too soon fulfilled! See yonder!
O rank and ravenous wolves! the death-bell echoes
Still in the doleful air&mdash;and see! they come. 105

Chef Ragozzi. Precise and faithful in their villainy
Even to the moment, that the master traitor
Had pre-ordained them.

Raab Kiuprili. Was it over-haste,
Or is it scorn, that in this race of treason
Their guilt thus drops its mask, and blazons forth 110
Their infamous plot even to an idiot's sense?

Chef Ragozzi. Doubtless they deem Heaven too usurp'd! Heaven's justice
Bought like themselves!
Being equal all in crime,
Do you press on, ye spotted parricides!
For the one sole pre-eminence yet doubtful, 115
The prize of foremost impudence in guilt?

Raab Kiuprili. The bad man's cunning still prepares the way
For its own outwitting. I applaud, Ragozzi!
Ragozzi! I applaud,
[888]
In thee, the virtuous hope that dares look onward
And keeps the life-spark warm of future action 120
Beneath the cloak of patient sufferance.
Act and appear, as time and prudence prompt thee:
I shall not misconceive the part thou playest.
Mine is an easier part&mdash;to brave the usurper.


[Enter a procession of Emerick's Adherents, Nobles, Chieftains, and
Soldiers, with Music. They advance toward the front of the stage.
Kiuprili makes the signal for them to stop.&mdash;The Music ceases.


Leader of the Procession. The Lord Kiuprili!&mdash;Welcome from the camp. 125

Raab Kiuprili. Grave magistrates and chieftains of Illyria,
In good time come ye hither, if ye come
As loyal men with honourable purpose
To mourn what can alone be mourned; but chiefly
To enforce the last commands of royal Andreas 130
And shield the Queen, Zapolya: haply making
The mother's joy light up the widow's tears.

Leader. Our purpose demands speed. Grace our procession;
A warrior best will greet a warlike king.

Raab Kiuprili. This patent written by your lawful king, 135
(Lo! his own seal and signature attesting)
Appoints as guardians of his realm and offspring,
The Queen, and the Prince Emerick, and myself.
[Voices of Live King Emerick! an Emerick! an Emerick!
What means this clamour? Are these madmen's voices?
Or is some knot of riotous slanderers leagued 140
To infamize the name of the king's brother
With a lie black as Hell? unmanly cruelty,
Ingratitude, and most unnatural treason? [Murmurs.
What mean these murmurs? Dare then any here
Proclaim Prince Emerick a spotted traitor? 145
One that has taken from you your sworn faith,
And given you in return a Judas' bribe,
Infamy now, oppression in reversion,
And Heaven's inevitable curse hereafter?

[Loud murmurs, followed by cries&mdash;Emerick! No Baby Prince! No
Changelings!

Yet bear with me awhile! Have I for this 150
[889]
Bled for your safety, conquered for your honour?
Was it for this, Illyrians! that I forded
Your thaw-swoln torrents, when the shouldering ice
Fought with the foe, and stained its jagged points
With gore from wounds I felt not? Did the blast 155
Beat on this body, frost-and-famine-numbed,
Till my hard flesh distinguished not itself
From the insensate mail, its fellow warrior?
And have I brought home with me Victory,
And with her, hand in hand, firm-footed Peace, 160
Her countenance twice lighted up with glory,
As if I had charmed a goddess down from Heaven?
But these will flee abhorrent from the throne
Of usurpation!

[Murmurs increase&mdash;and cries of Onward! Onward!

Have you then thrown off shame,
And shall not a dear friend, a loyal subject, 165
Throw off all fear? I tell ye, the fair trophies
Valiantly wrested from a valiant foe,
Love's natural offerings to a rightful king,
Will hang as ill on this usurping traitor,
This brother-blight, this Emerick, as robes 170
Of gold plucked from the images of gods
Upon a sacrilegious robber's back. [Enter Lord Casimir.

Casimir. Who is this factious insolent, that dares brand
The elected King, our chosen Emerick?
My father!

Raab Kiuprili. Casimir! He, he a traitor! 175
Too soon indeed, Ragozzi! have I learnt it. [Aside.

Casimir. My father and my lord!

Raab Kiuprili. I know thee not!

Leader. Yet the remembrancing did sound right filial.

Raab Kiuprili. A holy name and words of natural duty
Are blasted by a thankless traitor's utterance. 180

Casimir. O hear me, Sire! not lightly have I sworn
Homage to Emerick. Illyria's sceptre
Demands a manly hand, a warrior's grasp.
[890]
The queen Zapolya's self-expected offspring
At least is doubtful: and of all our nobles, 185
The king, inheriting his brother's heart,
Hath honoured us the most. Your rank, my lord!
Already eminent, is&mdash;all it can be&mdash;
Confirmed: and me the king's grace hath appointed
Chief of his council and the lord high steward. 190

Raab Kiuprili. (Bought by a bribe!) I know thee now still less.

Casimir. So much of Raab Kiuprili's blood flows here,
That no power, save that holy name of father,
Could shield the man who so dishonoured me.

Raab Kiuprili. The son of Raab Kiuprili a bought bond-slave, 195
Guilt's pander, treason's mouth-piece, a gay parrot,
School'd to shrill forth his feeder's usurp'd titles.
And scream, Long live King Emerick!

Leaders. Aye, King Emerick!
Stand back, my lord! Lead us, or let us pass.

Soldier. Nay, let the general speak!

Soldiers. Hear him! hear him!

Raab Kiuprili. Hear me, 200
Assembled lords and warriors of Illyria,
Hear, and avenge me! Twice ten years have I
Stood in your presence, honoured by the king:
Beloved and trusted. Is there one among you
Accuses Raab Kiuprili of a bribe? 205
Or one false whisper in his sovereign's ear?
Who here dares charge me with an orphan's rights
Outfaced, or widow's plea left undefended?
And shall I now be branded by a traitor,
A bought, bribed wretch, who, being called my son, 210
Doth libel a chaste matron's name, and plant
Hensbane and aconite on a mother's grave?
The underling accomplice of a robber,
That from a widow and a widow's offspring
Would steal their heritage? To God a rebel, 215
And to the common father of his country
A recreant ingrate!

Casimir. Sire! your words grow dangerous.
High-flown romantic fancies ill-beseem
[891]
Your age and wisdom. 'Tis a statesman's virtue,
To guard his country's safety by what means 220
It best may be protected&mdash;come what will
Of these monk's morals!

Raab Kiuprili (aside). Ha! the elder Brutus
Made his soul iron, though his sons repented.
They boasted not their baseness. [Draws his sword.
Infamous changeling!
Recant this instant, and swear loyalty, 225
And strict obedience to thy sovereign's will;
Or, by the spirit of departed Andreas,
Thou diest&mdash;&mdash;

[Chiefs, &amp;c., rush to interpose; during the tumult enter Emerick,
alarmed.


Emerick. Call out the guard! Ragozzi! seize the assassin.&mdash;&mdash;
Kiuprili? Ha!&mdash;&mdash; [Making signs to the guard to retire.
Pass on, friends! to the palace. 230


[Music recommences.&mdash;The Procession passes into the Palace.


Emerick. What? Raab Kiuprili? What? a father's sword
Against his own son's breast?

Raab Kiuprili. 'Twould best excuse him,
Were he thy son, Prince Emerick. I abjure him.

Emerick. This is my thanks, then, that I have commenced
A reign to which the free voice of the nobles 235
Hath called me, and the people, by regards
Of love and grace to Raab Kiuprili's house?

Raab Kiuprili. What right hadst thou, Prince Emerick, to bestow them?

Emerick. By what right dares Kiuprili question me?

Raab Kiuprili. By a right common to all loyal subjects&mdash; 240
To me a duty! As the realm's co-regent,
Appointed by our sovereign's last free act,
Writ by himself.&mdash; [Grasping the Patent.

Emerick. Aye!&mdash;Writ in a delirium!

Raab Kiuprili. I likewise ask, by whose authority
[892]
The access to the sovereign was refused me? 245

Emerick. By whose authority dared the general leave
His camp and army, like a fugitive?

Raab Kiuprili. A fugitive, who, with victory for his comrade,
Ran, open-eyed, upon the face of death!
A fugitive, with no other fear, than bodements 250
To be belated in a loyal purpose&mdash;
At the command, Prince! of my king and thine,
Hither I came; and now again require
Audience of Queen Zapolya; and (the States
Forthwith convened) that thou dost shew at large, 255
On what ground of defect thou'st dared annul
This thy King's last and solemn act&mdash;hast dared
Ascend the throne, of which the law had named,
And conscience should have made thee, a protector.

Emerick. A sovereign's ear ill brooks a subject's questioning! 260
Yet for thy past well-doing&mdash;and because
'Tis hard to erase at once the fond belief
Long cherished, that Illyria had in thee
No dreaming priest's slave, but a Roman lover
Of her true weal and freedom&mdash;and for this, too, 265
That, hoping to call forth to the broad day-light
And fostering breeze of glory all deservings,
I still had placed thee foremost.

Raab Kiuprili. Prince! I listen.

Emerick. Unwillingly I tell thee, that Zapolya,
Maddened with grief, her erring hopes proved idle&mdash; 270

Casimir. Sire! speak the whole truth! Say, her fraud detected!

Emerick. According to the sworn attests in council
Of her physician&mdash;&mdash;

Raab Kiuprili (aside). Yes! the Jew, Barzoni!

Emerick. Under the imminent risk of death she lies,
Or irrecoverable loss of reason, 275
If known friend's face or voice renew the frenzy.

Casimir (to Kiuprili). Trust me, my lord! a woman's trick has duped you&mdash;
Us too&mdash;but most of all, the sainted Andreas.
Even for his own fair fame, his grace prays hourly
For her recovery, that (the States convened) 280
She may take counsel of her friends.


[893]


Emerick. Right, Casimir!
Receive my pledge, lord general. It shall stand
In her own will to appear and voice her claims;
Or (which in truth I hold the wiser course)
With all the past passed by, as family quarrels, 285
Let the Queen Dowager, with unblenched honours,
Resume her state, our first Illyrian matron.

Raab Kiuprili. Prince Emerick! you speak fairly, and your pledge too
Is such, as well would suit an honest meaning.

Casimir. My lord! you scarce know half his grace's goodness. 290
The wealthy heiress, high-born fair Sarolta,
Bred in the convent of our noble ladies,
Her relative, the venerable abbess,
Hath, at his grace's urgence, wooed and won for me.

Emerick. Long may the race, and long may that name flourish, 295
Which your heroic deeds, brave chief, have rendered
Dear and illustrious to all true Illyrians.

Raab Kiuprili. The longest line that ever tracing herald
Or found or feigned, placed by a beggar's soul
Hath but a mushroom's date in the comparison: 300
And with the soul, the conscience is coeval,
Yea, the soul's essence.

Emerick. Conscience, good my lord,
Is but the pulse of reason. Is it conscience,
That a free nation should be handed down,
Like the dull clods beneath our feet, by chance 305
And the blind law of lineage? That whether infant,
Or man matured, a wise man or an idiot,
Hero or natural coward, shall have guidance
Of a free people's destiny, should fall out
In the mere lottery of a reckless nature, 310
Where few the prizes and the blanks are countless?
Or haply that a nation's fate should hang
On the bald accident of a midwife's handling
The unclosed sutures of an infant's skull?

Casimir. What better claim can sovereign wish or need 315
Than the free voice of men who love their country?
Those chiefly who have fought for't? Who by right,
Claim for their monarch one, who having obeyed,
[894]
So hath best learnt to govern; who, having suffered,
Can feel for each brave sufferer and reward him? 320
Whence sprang the name of Emperor? Was it not
By Nature's fiat? In the storm of triumph,
'Mid warriors' shouts, did her oracular voice
Make itself heard: Let the commanding spirit
Possess the station of command!

Raab Kiuprili. Prince Emerick, 325
Your cause will prosper best in your own pleading.

Emerick (aside to Casimir). Ragozzi was thy school-mate&mdash;a bold spirit!
Bind him to us!&mdash;Thy father thaws apace! [Then aloud.
Leave us awhile, my lord!&mdash;Your friend, Ragozzi,
Whom you have not yet seen since his return, 330
Commands the guard to-day.


[Casimir retires to the Guard-house; and after a time appears before it
with Chef Ragozzi.


We are alone.
What further pledge or proof desires Kiuprili?
Then, with your assent&mdash;&mdash;

Raab Kiuprili. Mistake not for assent
The unquiet silence of a stern resolve
Throttling the impatient voice. I have heard thee, Prince! 335
And I have watched thee, too; but have small faith in
A plausible tale told with a flitting eye.

[Emerick turns as about to call for the Guard.

In the next moment I am in thy power,
In this thou art in mine. Stir but a step,
Or make one sign&mdash;I swear by this good sword, 340
Thou diest that instant.

Emerick. Ha, ha!&mdash;Well, Sir!&mdash;Conclude your homily.

Raab Kiuprili. A tale which, whether true or false, comes guarded
Against all means of proof, detects itself.
The Queen mew'd up&mdash;this too from anxious care 345
And love brought forth of a sudden, a twin birth
With thy discovery of her plot to rob thee
Of a rightful throne!&mdash;Mark how the scorpion, falsehood,
Coils round in its own perplexity, and fixes
Its sting in its own head!

Emerick. Aye! to the mark! 350


[895]


Raab Kiuprili. Had'st thou believed thine own tale, had'st thou fancied
Thyself the rightful successor of Andreas,
Would'st thou have pilfered from our school-boys' themes
These shallow sophisms of a popular choice?
What people? How convened? or, if convened, 355
Must not the magic power that charms together
Millions of men in council, needs have power
To win or wield them? Better, O far better
Shout forth thy titles to yon circling mountains,
And with a thousand-fold reverberation 360
Make the rocks flatter thee, and the volleying air,
Unbribed, shout back to thee, King Emerick!
By wholesome laws to embank the sovereign power,
To deepen by restraint, and by prevention
Of lawless will to amass and guide the flood 365
In its majestic channel, is man's task
And the true patriot's glory! In all else
Men safelier trust to Heaven, than to themselves
When least themselves in the mad whirl of crowds
Where folly is contagious, and too oft 370
Even wise men leave their better sense at home
To chide and wonder at them when returned.

Emerick (aloud). Is't thus thou scoff'st the people? most of all,
The soldiers, the defenders of the people?

Raab Kiuprili. O most of all, most miserable nation, 375
For whom the imperial power, enormous bubble!
Is blown and kept aloft, or burst and shattered
By the bribed breath of a lewd soldiery!
Chiefly of such, as from the frontiers far,
(Which is the noblest station of true warriors) 380
In rank licentious idleness beleaguer
City and Court, a venomed thorn i'the side
Of virtuous kings, the tyrant's slave and tyrant,
Still ravening for fresh largess! But with such
What title claim'st thou, save thy birth? What merits 385
Which many a liegeman may not plead as well,
Brave though I grant thee? If a life outlaboured
Head, heart, and fortunate arm, in watch and war,
[896]
For the land's fame and weal; if large acquests,
Made honest by the aggression of the foe, 390
And whose best praise is, that they bring us safety;
If victory, doubly-wreathed, whose under-garland
Of laurel-leaves looks greener and more sparkling
Thro' the grey olive-branch; if these, Prince Emerick!
Give the true title to the throne, not thou&mdash; 395
No! (let Illyria, let the infidel enemy
Be judge and arbiter between us!) I,
I were the rightful sovereign!

Emerick. I have faith
That thou both think'st and hop'st it. Fair Zapolya,
A provident lady&mdash;

Raab Kiuprili. Wretch beneath all answer! 400

Emerick. Offers at once the royal bed and throne!

Raab Kiuprili. To be a kingdom's bulwark, a king's glory,
Yet loved by both, and trusted, and trust-worthy,
Is more than to be king; but see! thy rage
Fights with thy fear. I will relieve thee! Ho! [To the Guard. 405

Emerick. Not for thy sword, but to entrap thee, ruffian!
Thus long I have listened&mdash;Guard&mdash;ho! from the Palace.


[The Guard post from the Guard-house with
Chef Ragozzi at their head, and then a number
from the Palace&mdash;Chef Ragozzi demands
Kiuprili's sword, and apprehends him.


Casimir. O agony! [To Emerick.
Sire, hear me! [To Kiuprili, who turns from him.
Hear me, father!

Emerick. Take in arrest that traitor and assassin!
Who pleads for his life, strikes at mine, his sovereign's. 410

Raab Kiuprili. As the Co-regent of the Realm, I stand
Amenable to none save to the States
Met in due course of law. But ye are bond-slaves,
Yet witness ye that before God and man
I here impeach Lord Emerick of foul treason, 415
And on strong grounds attaint him with suspicion
Of murder&mdash;

Emerick. Hence with the madman!

Raab Kiuprili. Your Queen's murder,
The royal orphan's murder: and to the death
[897]
Defy him, as a tyrant and usurper. [Hurried off by Ragozzi and the Guard.

Emerick. Ere twice the sun hath risen, by my sceptre 420
This insolence shall be avenged.

Casimir. O banish him!
This infamy will crush me. O for my sake,
Banish him, my liege lord!

Emerick. What? to the army?
Be calm, young friend! Nought shall be done in anger.
The child o'erpowers the man. In this emergence 425
I must take counsel for us both. Retire. [Exit Casimir.

Emerick (alone, looks at a Calendar). The changeful planet, now in her decay,
Dips down at midnight, to be seen no more.
With her shall sink the enemies of Emerick,
Cursed by the last look of the waning moon: 430
And my bright destiny, with sharpened horns,
Shall greet me fearless in the new-born crescent. [Exit.


Scene changes to the back of the Palace&mdash;a Wooded Park, and Mountains.
Enter Zapolya, with an infant in arms.


Zapolya. Hush, dear one! hush! My trembling arm disturbs thee!
Thou, the protector of the helpless! Thou,
The widow's husband and the orphan's father, 435
Direct my steps! Ah whither? O send down
Thy angel to a houseless babe and mother,
Driven forth into the cruel wilderness!
Hush, sweet one! Thou art no Hagar's offspring: thou art
The rightful heir of an anointed king! 440
What sounds are those? It is the vesper chaunt
Of labouring men returning to their home!
Their queen has no home! Hear me, heavenly Father!
And let this darkness&mdash;&mdash;
Be as the shadow of thy outspread wings 445
To hide and shield us! Start'st thou in thy slumbers?
Thou canst not dream of savage Emerick. Hush!
Betray not thy poor mother! For if they seize thee
I shall grow mad indeed, and they'll believe
Thy wicked uncle's lie. Ha! what? A soldier? 450


[898]
[Enter Chef Ragozzi.


Chef Ragozzi. Sure Heaven befriends us. Well! he hath escaped!
O rare tune of a tyrant's promises
That can enchant the serpent treachery
From forth its lurking hole in the heart. 'Ragozzi!
O brave Ragozzi! Count! Commander! What not?' 455
And all this too for nothing! a poor nothing!
Merely to play the underling in the murder
Of my best friend Kiuprili! His own son&mdash;monstrous!
Tyrant! I owe thee thanks, and in good hour
Will I repay thee, for that thou thought'st me too 460
A serviceable villain. Could I now
But gain some sure intelligence of the queen:
Heaven bless and guard her!

Zapolya (coming forward). Art thou not Ragozzi?

Chef Ragozzi. The Queen! Now then the miracle is full! 465
I see heaven's wisdom is an over-match
For the devil's cunning. This way, madam, haste!

Zapolya. Stay! Oh, no! Forgive me if I wrong thee!
This is thy sovereign's child: Oh, pity us,
And be not treacherous! [Kneeling.

Chef Ragozzi (raising her). Madam! For mercy's sake! 470

Zapolya. But tyrants have a hundred eyes and arms!

Chef Ragozzi. Take courage, madam! 'Twere too horrible,
(I can not do't) to swear I'm not a monster!&mdash;
Scarce had I barr'd the door on Raab Kiuprili&mdash;

Zapolya. Kiuprili! How?

Chef Ragozzi. There is not time to tell it,&mdash; 475
The tyrant called me to him, praised my zeal&mdash;
(And be assured I overtopt his cunning
And seemed right zealous.) But time wastes: In fine,
Bids me dispatch my trustiest friends, as couriers
With letters to the army. The thought at once 480
Flashed on me. I disguised my prisoner&mdash;

Zapolya. What, Raab Kiuprili?

Chef Ragozzi. Yes! my noble general!
I sent him off, with Emerick's own pacquet,
Haste, and post haste&mdash;Prepared to follow him&mdash;&mdash;

[899]

Zapolya. Ah, how? Is it joy or fear? My limbs seem sinking!&mdash; 485

Chef Ragozzi (supporting her). Heaven still befriends us. I have left my charger,
A gentle beast and fleet, and my boy's mule,
One that can shoot a precipice like a bird,
Just where the wood begins to climb the mountains.
The course we'll thread will mock the tyrant's guesses, 490
Or scare the followers. Ere we reach the main road
The Lord Kiuprili will have sent a troop
To escort me. Oh, thrice happy when he finds
The treasure which I convoy!

Zapolya. One brief moment,
That praying for strength I may have strength. This babe, 495
Heaven's eye is on it, and its innocence
Is, as a prophet's prayer, strong and prevailing!
Through thee, dear babe, the inspiring thought possessed me,
When the loud clamor rose, and all the palace
Emptied itself&mdash;(They sought my life, Ragozzi!) 500
Like a swift shadow gliding, I made way
To the deserted chamber of my lord.&mdash; [Then to the infant.
And thou didst kiss thy father's lifeless lips,
And in thy helpless hand, sweet slumberer!
Still clasp'st the signet of thy royalty. 505
As I removed the seal, the heavy arm
Dropt from the couch aslant, and the stiff finger
Seemed pointing at my feet. Provident Heaven!
Lo, I was standing on the secret door,
Which, through a long descent where all sound perishes, 510
Led out beyond the palace. Well I knew it&mdash;&mdash;
But Andreas framed it not! He was no tyrant!

Chef Ragozzi. Haste, madam! Let me take this precious burden! [He kneels as he takes the child.

Zapolya. Take him! And if we be pursued, I charge thee,
Flee thou and leave me! Flee and save thy king! 515
[Then as going off, she looks back on the palace.
Thou tyrant's den, be called no more a palace!
The orphan's angel at the throne of heaven
Stands up against thee, and there hover o'er thee
A Queen's, a Mother's, and a Widow's curse.
Henceforth a dragon's haunt, fear and suspicion 520
Stand sentry at thy portals! Faith and honour,
[900]
Driven from the throne, shall leave the attainted nation:
And, for the iniquity that houses in thee,
False glory, thirst of blood, and lust of rapine,
(Fateful conjunction of malignant planets) 525
Shall shoot their blastments on the land. The fathers
Henceforth shall have no joy in their young men,
And when they cry: Lo! a male child is born!
The mother shall make answer with a groan.
For bloody usurpation, like a vulture, 530
Shall clog its beak within Illyria's heart.
Remorseless slaves of a remorseless tyrant,
They shall be mocked with sounds of liberty,
And liberty shall be proclaimed alone
To thee, O Fire! O Pestilence! O Sword! 535
Till Vengeance hath her fill.&mdash;And thou, snatched hence,
Poor friendless fugitive! with mother's wailing,
Offspring of Royal Andreas, shalt return,
With trump and timbrel-clang, and popular shout,
In triumph to the palace of thy fathers! [Exeunt.

USURPATION ENDED; OR, SHE COMES AGAIN



ACT I

Scene I

A Mountainous Country. Bathory's Dwelling at the end of the Stage.
Enter Lady Sarolta and Glycine.


Glycine. Well then! our round of charity is finished.
Rest, Madam! You breathe quick.

Sarolta. What, tired, Glycine?
No delicate court-dame, but a mountaineer
By choice no less than birth, I gladly use
The good strength Nature gave me.

Glycine. That last cottage 5
Is built as if an eagle or a raven
Had chosen it for her nest.

Sarolta. So many are
The sufferings which no human aid can reach,
It needs must be a duty doubly sweet
To heal the few we can. Well! let us rest. 10

Glycine. There? [Pointing to Bathory's dwelling.

Sarolta. Here! For on this spot Lord Casimir
Took his last leave. On yonder mountain-ridge
I lost the misty image which so long
Lingered, or seemed at least to linger on it.


[902]


Glycine. And what if even now, on that same ridge, 15
A speck should rise, and still enlarging, lengthening,
As it clomb downwards, shape itself at last
To a numerous cavalcade, and spurring foremost,
Who but Sarolta's own dear lord returned
From his high embassy?

Sarolta. Thou hast hit my thought! 20
All the long day, from yester-morn to evening,
The restless hope fluttered about my heart.
Oh we are querulous creatures! Little less
Than all things can suffice to make us happy;
And little more than nothing is enough 25
To discontent us.&mdash;Were he come, then should I
Repine he had not arrived just one day earlier
To keep his birth-day here, in his own birth-place.

Glycine. But our best sports belike, and gay processions
Would to my lord have seemed but work-day sights 30
Compared with those the royal court affords.

Sarolta. I have small wish to see them. A spring morning
With its wild gladsome minstrelsy of birds
And its bright jewelry of flowers and dew-drops
(Each orb&eacute;d drop an orb of glory in it) 35
Would put them all in eclipse. This sweet retirement
Lord Casimir's wish alone would have made sacred:
But, in good truth, his loving jealousy
Did but command, what I had else entreated.

Glycine. And yet had I been born Lady Sarolta, 40
Been wedded to the noblest of the realm,
So beautiful besides, and yet so stately&mdash;&mdash;

Sarolta. Hush! Innocent flatterer!

Glycine. Nay! to my poor fancy
The royal court would seem an earthly heaven,
Made for such stars to shine in, and be gracious. 45

Sarolta. So doth the ignorant distance still delude us!
Thy fancied heaven, dear girl, like that above thee,
In its mere self cold, drear, colourless void,
Seen from below and in the large, becomes
The bright blue ether, and the seat of gods! 50
Well! but this broil that scared you from the dance?
And was not Laska there: he, your betrothed?

Glycine. Yes, madam! he was there. So was the maypole,
For we danced round it.

Sarolta. Ah, Glycine! why,
[903]Why did you then betroth yourself?

Glycine. Because 55
My own dear lady wished it! 'twas you asked me!

Sarolta. Yes, at my lord's request, but never wished,
My poor affectionate girl, to see thee wretched.
Thou knowest not yet the duties of a wife.

Glycine. Oh, yes! It is a wife's chief duty, madam! 60
To stand in awe of her husband, and obey him,
And, I am sure, I never shall see Laska
But I shall tremble.

Sarolta. Not with fear, I think,
For you still mock him. Bring a seat from the cottage.

[Exit Glycine into the cottage, Sarolta continues her speech looking
after her.

Something above thy rank there hangs about thee, 65
And in thy countenance, thy voice, and motion,
Yea, e'en in thy simplicity, Glycine,
A fine and feminine grace, that makes me feel
More as a mother than a mistress to thee!
Thou art a soldier's orphan! that&mdash;the courage, 70
Which rising in thine eye, seems oft to give
A new soul to its gentleness, doth prove thee!
Thou art sprung too of no ignoble blood,
Or there's no faith in instinct! [Angry voices and clamour within.


Re-enter Glycine.


Glycine. Oh, madam! there's a party of your servants, 75
And my lord's steward, Laska, at their head,
Have come to search for old Bathory's son,
Bethlen, that brave young man! 'twas he, my lady,
That took our parts, and beat off the intruders,
And in mere spite and malice, now they charge him 80
With bad words of Lord Casimir and the king.
Pray don't believe them, madam! This way! This way!
Lady Sarolta's here.&mdash; [Calling without.

Sarolta. Be calm, Glycine.


Enter Laska and Servants with Old Bathory.


Laska (to Bathory). We have no concern with you! What needs your presence?

Old Bathory. What! Do you think I'll suffer my brave boy 85
[904]
To be slandered by a set of coward-ruffians,
And leave it to their malice,&mdash;yes, mere malice!&mdash;
To tell its own tale? [Laska and Servants bow to Lady Sarolta.

Sarolta. Laska! What may this mean?

Laska. Madam! and may it please your ladyship!
This old man's son, by name Bethlen Bathory, 90
Stands charged, on weighty evidence, that he,
On yester-eve, being his lordship's birth-day,
Did traitorously defame Lord Casimir:
The lord high steward of the realm, moreover&mdash;&mdash;

Sarolta. Be brief! We know his titles!

Laska. And moreover 95
Raved like a traitor at our liege King Emerick.
And furthermore, said witnesses make oath,
Led on the assault upon his lordship's servants;
Yea, insolently tore, from this, your huntsman,
His badge of livery of your noble house, 100
And trampled it in scorn.

Sarolta (to the Servants who offer to speak). You have had your spokesman!
Where is the young man thus accused?

Old Bathory. I know not:
But if no ill betide him on the mountains,
He will not long be absent!

Sarolta. Thou art his father? 105

Old Bathory. None ever with more reason prized a son;
Yet I hate falsehood more than I love him.
But more than one, now in my lady's presence,
Witnessed the affray, besides these men of malice;
And if I swerve from truth&mdash;&mdash;

Glycine. Yes! good old man! 110
My lady! pray believe him!

Sarolta. Hush, Glycine
Be silent, I command you. [Then to Bathory.
Speak! we hear you!

Old Bathory. My tale is brief. During our festive dance,
Your servants, the accusers of my son,
Offered gross insults, in unmanly sort, 115
To our village maidens. He (could he do less?)
Rose in defence of outraged modesty,
And so persuasive did his cudgel prove,
[905]
(Your hectoring sparks so over-brave to women
Are always cowards) that they soon took flight, 120
And now in mere revenge, like baffled boasters,
Have framed this tale, out of some hasty words
Which their own threats provoked.

Sarolta. Old man! you talk
Too bluntly! Did your son owe no respect
To the livery of our house?

Old Bathory. Even such respect 125
As the sheep's skin should gain for the hot wolf
That hath begun to worry the poor lambs!

Laska. Old insolent ruffian!

Glycine. Pardon! pardon, madam!
I saw the whole affray. The good old man
Means no offence, sweet lady!&mdash;You, yourself, 130
Laska! know well, that these men were the ruffians!
Shame on you!

Sarolta. What! Glycine? Go, retire! [Exit Glycine.
Be it then that these men faulted. Yet yourself,
Or better still belike the maidens' parents,
Might have complained to us. Was ever access 135
Denied you? Or free audience? Or are we
Weak and unfit to punish our own servants?

Old Bathory. So then! So then! Heaven grant an old man patience!
And must the gardener leave his seedling plants,
Leave his young roses to the rooting swine 140
While he goes ask their master, if perchance
His leisure serve to scourge them from their ravage?

Laska. Ho! Take the rude clown from your lady's presence!
I will report her further will!

Sarolta. Wait then,
Till thou hast learnt it! Fervent good old man! 145
Forgive me that, to try thee, I put on
A face of sternness, alien to my meaning! [Then speaks to the Servants.
Hence! leave my presence! and you, Laska! mark me!
Those rioters are no longer of my household!
If we but shake a dewdrop from a rose 150
In vain would we replace it, and as vainly
Restore the tear of wounded modesty
[906]
To a maiden's eye familiarized to licence.&mdash;
But these men, Laska&mdash;

Laska (aside). Yes, now 'tis coming.

Sarolta. Brutal aggressors first, then baffled dastards, 155
That they have sought to piece out their revenge
With a tale of words lured from the lips of anger
Stamps them most dangerous; and till I want
Fit means for wicked ends, we shall not need
Their services. Discharge them! You, Bathory! 160
Are henceforth of my household! I shall place you
Near my own person. When your son returns,
Present him to us!

Old Bathory. Ha! what strangers here!
[906:1]What business have they in an old man's eye?
Your goodness, lady&mdash;and it came so sudden&mdash; 165
I can not&mdash;must not&mdash;let you be deceived.
I have yet another tale, but&mdash; [Then to Sarolta aside.
not for all ears!

Sarolta. I oft have passed your cottage, and still praised
Its beauty, and that trim orchard-plot, whose blossoms
The gusts of April showered aslant its thatch. 170
Come, you shall show it me! And, while you bid it
Farewell, be not ashamed that I should witness
The oil of gladness glittering on the water
Of an ebbing grief. [Bathory shows her into his cottage.

Laska (alone). Vexation! baffled! school'd!
Ho! Laska! wake! why? what can all this mean? 175
She sent away that cockatrice in anger!
Oh the false witch! It is too plain, she loves him.
And now, the old man near my lady's person,
She'll see this Bethlen hourly!
[Laska flings himself into the seat. Glycine peeps in.

Glycine. Laska! Laska!
Is my lady gone?

Laska. Gone.


[907]


Glycine. Have you yet seen him? 180
Is he returned? [Laska starts up.
Has the seat stung you, Laska?

Laska. No, serpent! no; 'tis you that sting me; you!
What! you would cling to him again?

Glycine. Whom?

Laska. Bethlen! Bethlen!
Yes; gaze as if your very eyes embraced him! 185
Ha! you forget the scene of yesterday!
Mute ere he came, but then&mdash;Out on your screams,
And your pretended fears!

Glycine. Your fears, at least,
Were real, Laska! or your trembling limbs
And white cheeks played the hypocrites most vilely! 190

Laska. I fear! whom? what?

Glycine. I know what I should fear,
Were I in Laska's place.

Laska. What?

Glycine. My own conscience,
For having fed my jealousy and envy
With a plot, made out of other men's revenges,
Against a brave and innocent young man's life! 195
Yet, yet, pray tell me!

Laska. You will know too soon.

Glycine. Would I could find my lady! though she chid me&mdash;
Yet this suspense&mdash; [Going.

Laska. Stop! stop! one question only&mdash;
I am quite calm&mdash;

Glycine. Ay, as the old song says,
Calm as a tiger, valiant as a dove. 200
Nay now, I have marred the verse: well! this one question&mdash;

Laska. Are you not bound to me by your own promise?
And is it not as plain&mdash;

Glycine. Halt! that's two questions.

Laska. Pshaw! Is it not as plain as impudence,
That you're in love with this young swaggering beggar, 205
Bethlen Bathory? When he was accused,
Why pressed you forward? Why did you defend him?

Glycine. Question meet question: that's a woman's privilege,
[908]
Why, Laska, did you urge Lord Casimir
To make my lady force that promise from me? 210

Laska. So then, you say, Lady Sarolta, forced you?

Glycine. Could I look up to her dear countenance,
And say her nay? As far back as I wot of
All her commands were gracious, sweet requests.
How could it be then, but that her requests 215
Must needs have sounded to me as commands?
And as for love, had I a score of loves,
I'd keep them all for my dear, kind, good mistress.

Laska. Not one for Bethlen?

Glycine. Oh! that's a different thing.
To be sure he's brave, and handsome, and so pious 220
To his good old father. But for loving him&mdash;
Nay, there, indeed you are mistaken, Laska!
Poor youth! I rather think I grieve for him;
For I sigh so deeply when I think of him!
And if I see him, the tears come in my eyes, 225
And my heart beats; and all because I dreamt
That the war-wolf[908:1] had gored him as he hunted
In the haunted forest!

Laska. You dare own all this?
Your lady will not warrant promise-breach.
Mine, pampered Miss! you shall be; and I'll make you 230
Grieve for him with a vengeance. Odd's, my fingers
Tingle already! [Makes threatening signs.

Glycine (aside). Ha! Bethlen coming this way! [Glycine then cries out.
Oh, save me! save me! Pray don't kill me, Laska!


Enter Bethlen in a Hunting Dress.


Bethlen. What, beat a woman!

Laska (to Glycine). O you cockatrice!

Bethlen. Unmanly dastard, hold!

Laska. Do you chance to know 235
Who&mdash;I&mdash;am, Sir?&mdash;('Sdeath! how black he looks!)


[909]


Bethlen. I have started many strange beasts in my time,
But none less like a man, than this before me
That lifts his hand against a timid female.

Laska. Bold youth! she's mine.

Glycine. No, not my master yet, 240
But only is to be; and all, because
Two years ago my lady asked me, and
I promised her, not him; and if she'll let me,
I'll hate you, my lord's steward.

Bethlen. Hush, Glycine!

Glycine. Yes, I do, Bethlen; for he just now brought 245
False witnesses to swear away your life:
Your life, and old Bathory's too.

Bethlen. Bathory's!
Where is my father? Answer, or&mdash;&mdash;Ha! gone!


[Laska during this time retires from the Stage.


Glycine. Oh, heed not him! I saw you pressing onward,
And did but feign alarm. Dear gallant youth, 250
It is your life they seek!

Bethlen. My life?

Glycine. Alas,
Lady Sarolta even&mdash;

Bethlen. She does not know me!

Glycine. Oh that she did! she could not then have spoken
With such stern countenance. But though she spurn me,
I will kneel, Bethlen&mdash;

Bethlen. Not for me, Glycine! 255
What have I done? or whom have I offended?

Glycine. Rash words, 'tis said, and treasonous of the king.


[Bethlen mutters to himself.


Glycine (aside). So looks the statue, in our hall, o' the god,
The shaft just flown that killed the serpent!

Bethlen. King!

Glycine. Ah, often have I wished you were a king. 260
You would protect the helpless every where,
As you did us. And I, too, should not then
Grieve for you, Bethlen, as I do; nor have
[910]
The tears come in my eyes; nor dream bad dreams
That you were killed in the forest; and then Laska 265
Would have no right to rail at me, nor say
(Yes, the base man, he says,) that I&mdash;I love you.

Bethlen. Pretty Glycine! wert thou not betrothed&mdash;
But in good truth I know not what I speak.
This luckless morning I have been so haunted 270
With my own fancies, starting up like omens,
That I feel like one, who waking from a dream
Both asks and answers wildly.&mdash;But Bathory?

Glycine. Hist! 'tis my lady's step! She must not see you!
[Bethlen retires.


Enter from the Cottage Sarolta and Bathory.


Sarolta. Go, seek your son! I need not add, be speedy&mdash; 275
You here, Glycine? [Exit Bathory.

Glycine. Pardon, pardon, Madam!
If you but saw the old man's son, you would not,
You could not have him harmed.

Sarolta. Be calm, Glycine!

Glycine. No, I shall break my heart.

Sarolta. Ha! is it so?
O strange and hidden power of sympathy, 280
That of&mdash;like fates, though all unknown to each,
Dost make blind instincts, orphan's heart to orphan's
Drawing by dim disquiet!

Glycine. Old Bathory&mdash;

Sarolta. Seeks his brave son. Come, wipe away thy tears.
Yes, in good truth, Glycine, this same Bethlen 285
Seems a most noble and deserving youth.

Glycine. My lady does not mock me?

Sarolta. Where is Laska?
Has he not told thee?

Glycine. Nothing. In his fear&mdash;
Anger, I mean&mdash;stole off&mdash;I am so fluttered&mdash;
Left me abruptly&mdash;

Sarolta. His shame excuses him! 290
He is somewhat hardly tasked; and in discharging
His own tools, cons a lesson for himself.
Bathory and the youth henceforward live
Safe in my lord's protection.

Glycine. The saints bless you!
[911]
Shame on my graceless heart! How dared I fear, 295
Lady Sarolta could be cruel?

Sarolta. Come,
Be yourself, girl!

Glycine. O, 'tis so full here!
And now it can not harm him if I tell you,
That the old man's son&mdash;

Sarolta. Is not that old man's son!
A destiny, not unlike thine own, is his. 300
For all I know of thee is, that thou art
A soldier's orphan: left when rage intestine[911:1]
Shook and engulphed the pillars of Illyria.
This other fragment, thrown back by that same earthquake,
This, so mysteriously inscribed by nature, 305
Perchance may piece out and interpret thine.
Command thyself! Be secret! His true father&mdash;&mdash;
Hear'st thou?

Glycine. O tell&mdash;

Bethlen (rushing out). Yes, tell me, Shape from heaven!
Who is my father?

Sarolta (gazing with surprise). Thine? Thy father? Rise!

Glycine. Alas! He hath alarmed you, my dear lady! 310

Sarolta. His countenance, not his act!

Glycine. Rise, Bethlen! Rise!

Bethlen. No; kneel thou too! and with thy orphan's tongue
Plead for me! I am rooted to the earth
And have no power to rise! Give me a father!
There is a prayer in those uplifted eyes 315
That seeks high Heaven! But I will overtake it,
[912]
And bring it back, and make it plead for me
In thine own heart! Speak! Speak! Restore to me
A name in the world!

Sarolta. By that blest Heaven I gazed at,
I know not who thou art. And if I knew, 320
Dared I&mdash;But rise!

Bethlen. Blest spirits of my parents,
Ye hover o'er me now! Ye shine upon me!
And like a flower that coils forth from a ruin,
I feel and seek the light I can not see!

Sarolta. Thou see'st yon dim spot on the mountain's ridge, 325
But what it is thou know'st not. Even such
Is all I know of thee&mdash;haply, brave youth,
Is all Fate makes it safe for thee to know!

Bethlen. Safe? Safe? O let me then inherit danger,
And it shall be my birth-right!

Sarolta (aside). That look again!&mdash; 330
The wood which first incloses, and then skirts
The highest track that leads across the mountains&mdash;
Thou know'st it, Bethlen?

Bethlen. Lady, 'twas my wont
To roam there in my childhood oft alone
And mutter to myself the name of father. 335
For still Bathory (why, till now I guessed not)
Would never hear it from my lips, but sighing
Gazed upward. Yet of late an idle terror&mdash;&mdash;

Glycine. Madam, that wood is haunted by the war-wolves,
Vampires, and monstrous&mdash;&mdash;

Sarolta. Moon-calves, credulous girl! 340
Haply some o'ergrown savage of the forest
Hath his lair there, and fear hath framed the rest.
After that last great battle, (O young man!
Thou wakest anew my life's sole anguish) that
Which fixed Lord Emerick on his throne, Bathory 345
Led by a cry, far inward from the track,
In the hollow of an oak, as in a nest,
Did find thee, Bethlen, then a helpless babe.
The robe that wrapt thee was a widow's mantle.

Bethlen. An infant's weakness doth relax my frame. 350
O say&mdash;I fear to ask&mdash;&mdash;

Sarolta. And I to tell thee.


[913]


Bethlen. Strike! O strike quickly! See, I do not shrink.
I am stone, cold stone.

Sarolta. Hid in a brake hard by,
Scarce by both palms supported from the earth,
A wounded lady lay, whose life fast waning 355
Seemed to survive itself in her fixt eyes,
That strained towards the babe. At length one arm
Painfully from her own weight disengaging,
She pointed first to heaven, then from her bosom
Drew forth a golden casket. Thus entreated 360
Thy foster-father took thee in his arms,
And kneeling spake: 'If aught of this world's comfort
Can reach thy heart, receive a poor man's troth,
That at my life's risk I will save thy child!'
Her countenance worked, as one that seemed preparing 365
A loud voice, but it died upon her lips
In a faint whisper, 'Fly! Save him! Hide&mdash;hide all!'

Bethlen. And did he leave her? What! had I a mother?
And left her bleeding, dying? Bought I vile life
With the desertion of a dying mother? 370
Oh agony!

Glycine. Alas! thou art bewildered,
And dost forget thou wert a helpless infant!

Bethlen. What else can I remember, but a mother
Mangled and left to perish?

Sarolta. Hush, Glycine!
It is the ground-swell of a teeming instinct: 375
Let it but lift itself to air and sunshine,
And it will find a mirror in the waters
It now makes boil above it. Check him not!

Bethlen. O that I were diffused among the waters
That pierce into the secret depths of earth, 380
And find their way in darkness! Would that I
Could spread myself upon the homeless winds!
And I would seek her! for she is not dead!
She can not die! O pardon, gracious lady!
You were about to say, that he returned&mdash; 385

Sarolta. Deep Love, the godlike in us, still believes
Its objects as immortal as itself!

Bethlen. And found her still&mdash;

Sarolta. Alas! he did return,
[914]
He left no spot unsearched in all the forest,
But she (I trust me by some friendly hand) 390
Had been borne off.

Bethlen. O whither?

Glycine. Dearest Bethlen!
I would that you could weep like me! O do not
Gaze so upon the air!

Sarolta. While he was absent,
A friendly troop, 'tis certain, scoured the wood,
Hotly pursued indeed by Emerick.

Bethlen. Emerick. 395
Oh hell!

Glycine. Bethlen!

Bethlen. Hist! I'll curse him in a whisper!
This gracious lady must hear blessings only.
She hath not yet the glory round her head,
Nor those strong eagle wings, which make swift way
To that appointed place, which I must seek; 400
Or else she were my mother!

Sarolta. Noble youth!
From me fear nothing! Long time have I owed
Offerings of expiation for misdeeds
Long past that weigh me down, though innocent!
Thy foster-father hid the secret from thee, 405
For he perceived thy thoughts as they expanded,
Proud, restless, and ill-sorting with thy state!
Vain was his care! Thou'st made thyself suspected
E'en where suspicion reigns, and asks no proof
But its own fears! Great Nature hath endowed thee 410
With her best gifts! From me thou shalt receive
All honourable aidance! But haste hence!
Travel will ripen thee, and enterprise
Beseems thy years! Be thou henceforth my soldier!
And whatsoe'er betide thee, still believe 415
That in each noble deed, achieved or suffered,
Thou solvest best the riddle of thy birth!
And may the light that streams from thine own honour
Guide thee to that thou seekest!

Glycine. Must he leave us?


[915]


Bethlen. And for such goodness can I return nothing 420
But some hot tears that sting mine eyes? Some sighs
That if not breathed would swell my heart to stifling?
May heaven and thine own virtues, high-born lady,
Be as a shield of fire, far, far aloof
To scare all evil from thee! Yet, if fate 425
Hath destined thee one doubtful hour of danger,
From the uttermost region of the earth, methinks,
Swift as a spirit invoked, I should be with thee!
And then, perchance, I might have power to unbosom
These thanks that struggle here. Eyes fair as thine 430
Have gazed on me with tears of love and anguish,
Which these eyes saw not, or beheld unconscious;
And tones of anxious fondness, passionate prayers,
Have been talked to me! But this tongue ne'er soothed
A mother's ear, lisping a mother's name! 435
O, at how dear a price have I been loved
And no love could return! One boon then, lady!
Where'er thou bidd'st, I go thy faithful soldier,
But first must trace the spot, where she lay bleeding
Who gave me life. No more shall beast of ravine 440
Affront with baser spoil that sacred forest!
Or if avengers more than human haunt there,
Take they what shape they list, savage or heavenly,
They shall make answer to me, though my heart's blood
Should be the spell to bind them. Blood calls for blood! 445
[Exit Bethlen.

Sarolta. Ah! it was this I feared. To ward off this
Did I withhold from him that old Bathory
Returning hid beneath the self-same oak,
Where the babe lay, the mantle, and some jewel
Bound on his infant arm.

Glycine. Oh, let me fly 450
And stop him! Mangled limbs do there lie scattered
Till the lured eagle bears them to her nest.
And voices have been heard! And there the plant grows
That being eaten gives the inhuman wizard
Power to put on the fell hy&aelig;na's shape. 455

Sarolta. What idle tongue hath bewitched thee, Glycine?
I hoped that thou had'st learnt a nobler faith.

Glycine. O chide me not, dear lady; question Laska,
[916]
Or the old man.

Sarolta. Forgive me, I spake harshly.
It is indeed a mighty sorcery 460
That doth enthral thy young heart, my poor girl,
And what hath Laska told thee?

Glycine. Three days past
A courier from the king did cross that wood;
A wilful man, that armed himself on purpose:
And never hath been heard of from that time! 465


[Sound of horns without.


Sarolta. Hark! dost thou hear it!

Glycine. 'Tis the sound of horns!
Our huntsmen are not out!

Sarolta. Lord Casimir
Would not come thus! [Horns again.

Glycine. Still louder!

Sarolta. Haste we hence!
For I believe in part thy tale of terror!
But, trust me, 'tis the inner man transformed: 470
Beasts in the shape of men are worse than war-wolves.


[Sarolta and Glycine exeunt. Trumpets, &amp;c. louder. Enter Emerick, Lord
Rudolph, Laska, and Huntsmen and Attendants.


Rudolph. A gallant chase, sire.

Emerick. Aye, but this new quarry
That we last started seems worth all the rest. [then to Laska.
And you&mdash;excuse me&mdash;what's your name?

Laska. Whatever
Your majesty may please.

Emerick. Nay, that's too late, man. 475
Say, what thy mother and thy godfather
Were pleased to call thee.

Laska. Laska, my liege sovereign.

Emerick. Well, my liege subject, Laska! And you are
Lord Casimir's steward?

Laska. And your majesty's creature.

Emerick. Two gentle dames made off at our approach. 480
Which was your lady?

Laska My liege lord, the taller.
The other, please your grace, is her poor handmaid,
Long since betrothed to me. But the maid's froward&mdash;
[917]
Yet would your grace but speak&mdash;

Emerick. Hum, master steward!
I am honoured with this sudden confidence. 485
Lead on. [to Laska, then to Rudolph.
Lord Rudolph, you'll announce our coming.
Greet fair Sarolta from me, and entreat her
To be our gentle hostess. Mark, you add
How much we grieve, that business of the state
Hath forced us to delay her lord's return. 490

Lord Rudolph (aside). Lewd, ingrate tyrant! Yes, I will announce thee.

Emerick. Now onward all. [Exeunt attendants.
A fair one, by my faith!
If her face rival but her gait and stature,
My good friend Casimir had his reasons too.
'Her tender health, her vow of strict retirement, 495
Made early in the convent&mdash;His word pledged&mdash;'
All fictions, all! fictions of jealousy.
Well! If the mountain move not to the prophet,
The prophet must to the mountain! In this Laska
There's somewhat of the knave mixed up with dolt. 500
Through the transparence of the fool, methought,
I saw (as I could lay my finger on it)
The crocodile's eye, that peered up from the bottom.
This knave may do us service. Hot ambition
Won me the husband. Now let vanity 505
And the resentment for a forced seclusion
Decoy the wife! Let him be deemed the aggressor
Whose cunning and distrust began the game! [Exit.

ACT II

Scene I

A savage wood. At one side a cavern, overhung with ivy. Zapolya and
Raab Kiuprili discovered: both, but especially the latter, in rude and
savage garments.


Raab Kiuprili. Heard you then aught while I was slumbering?

Zapolya. Nothing.
[918]
Only your face became convulsed. We miserable!
Is heaven's last mercy fled? Is sleep grown treacherous?

Raab Kiuprili. O for a sleep, for sleep itself to rest in!
I dream'd I had met with food beneath a tree, 5
And I was seeking you, when all at once
My feet became entangled in a net:
Still more entangled as in rage I tore it.
At length I freed myself, had sight of you,
But as I hastened eagerly, again 10
I found my frame encumbered: a huge serpent
Twined round my chest, but tightest round my throat.

Zapolya. Alas! 'twas lack of food: for hunger chokes!

Raab Kiuprili. And now I saw you by a shrivelled child
Strangely pursued. You did not fly, yet neither 15
Touched you the ground, methought, but close above it
Did seem to shoot yourself along the air,
And as you passed me, turned your face and shrieked.

Zapolya. I did in truth send forth a feeble shriek,
Scarce knowing why. Perhaps the mock'd sense craved 20
To hear the scream, which you but seemed to utter.
For your whole face looked like a mask of torture!
Yet a child's image doth indeed pursue me
Shrivelled with toil and penury!

Raab Kiuprili. Nay! what ails you?

Zapolya. A wondrous faintness there comes stealing o'er me. 25
Is it Death's lengthening shadow, who comes onward,
Life's setting sun behind him?

Raab Kiuprili. Cheerly! The dusk
Will quickly shroud us. Ere the moon be up,
Trust me I'll bring thee food!

Zapolya. Hunger's tooth has
Gnawn itself blunt. O, I could queen it well 30
O'er my own sorrows as my rightful subjects.
But wherefore, O revered Kiuprili! wherefore
Did my importunate prayers, my hopes and fancies,
Force thee from thy secure though sad retreat?
Would that my tongue had then cloven to my mouth! 35
But Heaven is just! With tears I conquered thee,
And not a tear is left me to repent with!
Had'st thou not done already&mdash;had'st thou not
Suffered&mdash;oh, more than e'er man feigned of friendship?


[919]


Raab Kiuprili. Yet be thou comforted! What! had'st thou faith 40
When I turned back incredulous? 'Twas thy light
That kindled mine. And shall it now go out,
And leave thy soul in darkness? Yet look up,
And think thou see'st thy sainted lord commissioned
And on his way to aid us! Whence those late dreams, 45
Which after such long interval of hopeless
And silent resignation all at once
Night after night commanded thy return
Hither? and still presented in clear vision
This wood as in a scene? this very cavern? 50
Thou darest not doubt that Heaven's especial hand
Worked in those signs. The hour of thy deliverance
Is on the stroke:&mdash;for misery can not add
Grief to thy griefs, or patience to thy sufferance!

Zapolya. Can not! Oh, what if thou wert taken from me? 55
Nay, thou said'st well: for that and death were one.
Life's grief is at its height indeed; the hard
Necessity of this inhuman state
Hath made our deeds inhuman as our vestments.
Housed in this wild wood, with wild usages, 60
Danger our guest, and famine at our portal&mdash;
Wolf-like to prowl in the shepherd's fold by night!
At once for food and safety to affrighten
The traveller from his road&mdash; [Glycine is heard singing without.

Raab Kiuprili. Hark! heard you not
A distant chaunt? 65



SONG

By Glycine

A sunny shaft did I behold,
From sky to earth it slanted:
And poised therein a bird so bold&mdash;
Sweet bird, thou wert enchanted!
He sank, he rose, he twinkled, he trolled 70
Within that shaft of sunny mist;
His eyes of fire, his beak of gold,
All else of amethyst!
[920]
And thus he sang: 'Adieu! adieu!
Love's dreams prove seldom true. 75
The blossoms, they make no delay:
The sparkling dew-drops will not stay.
Sweet month of May,
We must away;
Far, far away! 80
To-day! to-day!'



Zapolya. Sure 'tis some blest spirit!
For since thou slew'st the usurper's emissary
That plunged upon us, a more than mortal fear
Is as a wall, that wards off the beleaguerer 85
And starves the poor besieged. [Song again.

Raab Kiuprili. It is a maiden's voice! quick to the cave!

Zapolya. Hark! her voice falters! [Exit Zapolya.

Raab Kiuprili. She must not enter
The cavern, else I will remain unseen!
[Kiuprili retires to one side of the stage. Glycine enters singing.

Glycine. A savage place! saints shield me! Bethlen! Bethlen! 90
Not here?&mdash;There's no one here! I'll sing again! [Sings again.
If I do not hear my own voice, I shall fancy
Voices in all chance sounds! [Starts.
'Twas some dry branch
Dropt of itself! Oh, he went forth so rashly,
Took no food with him&mdash;only his arms and boar-spear! 95
What if I leave these cakes, this cruse of wine,
Here by this cave, and seek him with the rest?

Raab Kiuprili (unseen). Leave them and flee!

Glycine (shrieks, then recovering.) Where are you?

Raab Kiuprili (still unseen.) Leave them!

Glycine. 'Tis Glycine!
Speak to me, Bethlen! speak in your own voice! 100
All silent!&mdash;If this were the war-wolf's den!
'Twas not his voice!&mdash;


[Glycine leaves the provisions, and exit. Kiuprili comes forward,
seizes them and carries them into the cavern. Glycine returns.

[921]


Glycine. Shame! Nothing hurt me!
If some fierce beast have gored him, he must needs
Speak with a strange voice. Wounds cause thirst and hoarseness!
Speak, Bethlen! or but moan. St&mdash;St&mdash;&mdash;No&mdash;Bethlen! 105
If I turn back and he should be found dead here, [She creeps nearer and nearer to the cavern.
I should go mad!&mdash;Again!&mdash;'Twas my own heart!
Hush, coward heart! better beat loud with fear,
Than break with shame and anguish!

[As she approaches to enter the cavern, Kiuprili stops her. Glycine
shrieks.

Saints protect me!

Raab Kiuprili. Swear then by all thy hopes, by all thy fears&mdash; 110

Glycine. Save me!

Raab Kiuprili. Swear secrecy and silence!

Glycine. I swear!

Raab Kiuprili. Tell what thou art, and what thou seekest?

Glycine. Only
A harmless orphan youth, to bring him food&mdash;

Raab Kiuprili. Wherefore in this wood?

Glycine. Alas! it was his purpose&mdash;

Raab Kiuprili. With what intention came he? Would'st thou save him, 115
Hide nothing!

Glycine. Save him! O forgive his rashness!
He is good, and did not know that thou wert human!

Raab Kiuprili. Human?
With what design?

Glycine. To kill thee, or
If that thou wert a spirit, to compel thee
By prayers, and with the shedding of his blood, 120
To make disclosure of his parentage.
But most of all&mdash;

Zapolya (rushing out from the cavern). Heaven's blessing on thee! Speak!

Glycine. Whether his mother live, or perished here!

Zapolya. Angel of mercy, I was perishing
And thou did'st bring me food: and now thou bring'st 125
The sweet, sweet food of hope and consolation
[922]To a mother's famished heart! His name, sweet maiden!

Glycine. E'en till this morning we were wont to name him
Bethlen Bathory!

Zapolya. Even till this morning?
This morning? when my weak faith failed me wholly! 130
Pardon, O thou that portion'st out our sufferance,
And fill'st again the widow's empty cruse!
Say on!

Glycine. The false ones charged the valiant youth
With treasonous words of Emerick&mdash;

Zapolya. Ha! my son!

Glycine. And of Lord Casimir&mdash;

Raab Kiuprili (aside). O agony! my son! 135

Glycine. But my dear lady&mdash;

Zapolya and Raab Kiuprili. Who?

Glycine. Lady Sarolta
Frowned and discharged these bad men.

Raab Kiuprili (to himself). Righteous Heaven
Sent me a daughter once, and I repined
That it was not a son. A son was given me.
My daughter died, and I scarce shed a tear: 140
And lo! that son became my curse and infamy.

Zapolya (embraces Glycine). Sweet innocent! and you came here to seek him,
And bring him food. Alas! thou fear'st?

Glycine. Not much!
My own dear lady, when I was a child,
Embraced me oft, but her heart never beat so. 145
For I too am an orphan, motherless!

Raab Kiuprili (to Zapolya). O yet beware, lest hope's brief flash but deepen
The after gloom, and make the darkness stormy!
In that last conflict, following our escape,
The usurper's cruelty had clogged our flight 150
With many a babe and many a childing mother.
This maid herself is one of numberless
Planks from the same vast wreck. [Then to Glycine again.
Well! Casimir's wife&mdash;

Glycine. She is always gracious, and so praised the old man
[923]
That his heart o'erflowed, and made discovery 155
That in this wood&mdash;

Zapolya. O speak!

Glycine. A wounded lady&mdash;


[Zapolya faints&mdash;they both support her.


Glycine. Is this his mother?

Raab Kiuprili. She would fain believe it,
Weak though the proofs be. Hope draws towards itself
The flame with which it kindles. [Horn heard without.
To the cavern!
Quick! quick!

Glycine. Perchance some huntsmen of the king's. 160

Raab Kiuprili. Emerick?

Glycine. He came this morning&mdash;


[They retire to the cavern, bearing Zapolya. Then enter Bethlen, armed
with a boar-spear.


Bethlen. I had a glimpse
Of some fierce shape; and but that Fancy often
Is Nature's intermeddler, and cries halves
With the outward sight, I should believe I saw it
Bear off some human prey. O my preserver! 165
Bathory! Father! Yes, thou deserv'st that name!
Thou did'st not mock me! These are blessed findings!
The secret cypher of my destiny [Looking at his signet.
Stands here inscribed: it is the seal of fate!
Ha!&mdash;Had ever monster fitting lair, 'tis yonder! 170
Thou yawning den, I well remember thee!
Mine eyes deceived me not. Heaven leads me on!
Now for a blast, loud as a king's defiance,
To rouse the monster couchant o'er his ravine! [Blows the horn&mdash;then a pause.
Another blast! and with another swell 175
To you, ye charm&eacute;d watchers of this wood!
If haply I have come, the rightful heir
Of vengeance: if in me survive the spirits
Of those, whose guiltless blood flowed streaming here! [Blows again louder.
Still silent? Is the monster gorged? Heaven shield me! 180
Thou, faithful spear! be both my torch and guide.
[As Bethlen is about to enter, Kiuprili speaks from the cavern unseen.


[924]


Raab Kiuprili. Withdraw thy foot! Retract thine idle spear,
And wait obedient!

Bethlen. Ha! What art thou? speak!

Raab Kiuprili (still unseen). Avengers!

Bethlen. By a dying mother's pangs
E'en such am I. Receive me!

Raab Kiuprili (still unseen). Wait! Beware! 185
At thy first step, thou treadest upon the light,
Thenceforth must darkling flow, and sink in darkness!

Bethlen. Ha! see my boar-spear trembles like a reed!&mdash;
Oh, fool! mine eyes are duped by my own shuddering.&mdash;
Those pil&eacute;d thoughts, built up in solitude, 190
Year following year, that pressed upon my heart
As on the altar of some unknown God,
Then, as if touched by fire from heaven descending.
Blazed up within me at a father's name&mdash;
Do they desert me now?&mdash;at my last trial? 195
Voice of command! and thou, O hidden Light!
I have obeyed! Declare ye by what name
I dare invoke you! Tell what sacrifice
Will make you gracious.

Raab Kiuprili (still unseen). Patience! Truth! Obedience!
Be thy whole soul transparent! so the Light, 200
Thou seekest, may enshrine itself within thee!
Thy name?

Bethlen. Ask rather the poor roaming savage,
Whose infancy no holy rite had blest,
To him, perchance, rude spoil or ghastly trophy,
In chase or battle won, have given a name. 205
I have none&mdash;but like a dog have answered
To the chance sound which he that fed me, called me.

Raab Kiuprili (still unseen). Thy birth-place?

Bethlen. Deluding spirits! Do ye mock me?
Question the Night! Bid Darkness tell its birth-place?
Yet hear! Within yon old oak's hollow trunk, 210
Where the bats cling, have I surveyed my cradle!
The mother-falcon hath her nest above it,
And in it the wolf litters!&mdash;--I invoke you,
Tell me, ye secret ones! if ye beheld me
As I stood there, like one who having delved 215
For hidden gold hath found a talisman,
[925]
O tell! what rights, what offices of duty
This signet doth command? What rebel spirits
Owe homage to its Lord?

Raab Kiuprili (still unseen). More, guiltier, mightier,
Than thou mayest summon! Wait the destined hour! 220

Bethlen. O yet again, and with more clamorous prayer,
I importune ye! Mock me no more with shadows!
This sable mantle&mdash;tell, dread voice! did this
Enwrap one fatherless!

Zapolya (unseen). One fatherless!

Bethlen. A sweeter voice!&mdash;A voice of love and pity! 225
Was it the softened echo of mine own?
Sad echo! but the hope it kill'd was sickly,
And ere it died it had been mourned as dead!
One other hope yet lives within my soul:
Quick let me ask!&mdash;while yet this stifling fear, 230
This stop of the heart, leaves utterance!&mdash;Are&mdash;are these
The sole remains of her that gave me life?
Have I a mother? [Zapolya rushes out to embrace him.
Ha!

Zapolya. My son! my son!
A wretched&mdash;Oh no, no! a blest&mdash;a happy mother!


[They embrace. Kiuprili and Glycine come forward and the curtain
drops.

ACT III

Scene I

A stately room in Lord Casimir's castle. Enter Emerick and Laska.


Emerick. I do perceive thou hast a tender conscience,
Laska, in all things that concern thine own
Interest or safety.

Laska. In this sovereign presence
I can fear nothing, but your dread displeasure.

Emerick. Perchance, thou think'st it strange, that I of all men 5
Should covet thus the love of fair Sarolta,
[926]
Dishonouring Casimir?

Laska. Far be it from me!
Your Majesty's love and choice bring honour with them.

Emerick. Perchance, thou hast heard that Casimir is my friend,
Fought for me, yea, for my sake, set at nought 10
A parent's blessing; braved a father's curse?

Laska (aside). Would I but knew now, what his Majesty meant!
Oh yes, Sire! 'tis our common talk, how Lord
Kiuprili, my Lord's father&mdash;

Emerick. 'Tis your talk,
Is it, good statesman Laska?

Laska. No, not mine, 15
Not mine, an please your Majesty! There are
Some insolent malcontents indeed that talk thus&mdash;
Nay worse, mere treason. As Bathory's son,
The fool that ran into the monster's jaws.

Emerick. Well, 'tis a loyal monster if he rids us 20
Of traitors! But art sure the youth's devoured?

Laska. Not a limb left, an please your Majesty!
And that unhappy girl&mdash;

Emerick. Thou followed'st her
Into the wood? [Laska bows assent.
Henceforth then I'll believe
That jealousy can make a hare a lion. 25

Laska. Scarce had I got the first glimpse of her veil,
When, with a horrid roar that made the leaves
Of the wood shake&mdash;

Emerick. Made thee shake like a leaf!

Laska. The war-wolf leapt; at the first plunge he seized her;
Forward I rushed!

Emerick. Most marvellous!

Laska. Hurled my javelin; 30
Which from his dragon-scales recoiling&mdash;

Emerick. Enough!
And take, friend, this advice. When next thou tonguest it,
Hold constant to thy exploit with this monster,
And leave untouched your common talk aforesaid,
What your Lord did, or should have done.

Laska. My talk? 35
The saints forbid! I always said, for my part,
[927]
'Was not the king Lord Casimir's dearest friend?
Was not that friend a king? Whate'er he did
'Twas all from pure love to his Majesty.'

Emerick. And this then was thy talk? While knave and coward, 40
Both strong within thee, wrestle for the uppermost,
In slips the fool and takes the place of both.
Babbler! Lord Casimir did, as thou and all men.
He loved himself, loved honours, wealth, dominion.
All these were set upon a father's head: 45
Good truth! a most unlucky accident!
For he but wished to hit the prize; not graze
The head that bore it: so with steady eye
Off flew the parricidal arrow.&mdash;Even
As Casimir loved Emerick, Emerick 50
Loves Casimir, intends him no dishonour.
He winked not then, for love of me forsooth!
For love of me now let him wink! Or if
The dame prove half as wise as she is fair,
He may still pass his hand, and find all smooth. 55
[Passing his hand across his brow.

Laska. Your Majesty's reasoning has convinced me.

Emerick. Thee!
'Tis well! and more than meant. For by my faith
I had half forgotten thee.&mdash;Thou hast the key? [Laska bows.
And in your lady's chamber there's full space?

Laska. Between the wall and arras to conceal you. 60

Emerick. Here! This purse is but an earnest of thy fortune,
If thou prov'st faithful. But if thou betrayest me,
Hark you!&mdash;the wolf that shall drag thee to his den
Shall be no fiction.


[Exit Emerick. Laska manet with a key in one hand, and a purse in the
other.


Laska. Well then! here I stand,
Like Hercules, on either side a goddess. 65
Call this (looking at the purse)
Preferment; this (holding up the key) Fidelity!
And first my golden goddess: what bids she?
[928]
Only:&mdash;'This way, your Majesty! hush! The household
Are all safe lodged.'&mdash;Then, put Fidelity
Within her proper wards, just turn her round&mdash; 70
So&mdash;the door opens&mdash;and for all the rest,
'Tis the king's deed, not Laska's. Do but this
And&mdash;'I'm the mere earnest of your future fortunes.'
But what says the other?&mdash;Whisper on! I hear you! [Putting the key to his ear.
All very true!&mdash;but, good Fidelity! 75
If I refuse King Emerick, will you promise,
And swear now, to unlock the dungeon door,
And save me from the hangman? Aye! you're silent!
What, not a word in answer? A clear nonsuit!
Now for one look to see that all are lodged 80
At the due distance&mdash;then&mdash;yonder lies the road
For Laska and his royal friend, King Emerick!


[Exit Laska. Then enter Bathory and Bethlen.


Bethlen. He looked as if he were some God disguised
In an old warrior's venerable shape
To guard and guide my mother. Is there not 85
Chapel or oratory in this mansion?

Old Bathory. Even so.

Bethlen. From that place then am I to take
A helm and breast-plate, both inlaid with gold,
And the good sword that once was Raab Kiuprili's.

Old Bathory. Those very arms this day Sarolta show'd me&mdash; 90
With wistful look. I'm lost in wild conjectures!

Bethlen. O tempt me not, e'en with a wandering guess,
To break the first command a mother's will
Imposed, a mother's voice made known to me!
'Ask not, my son,' said she, 'our names or thine. 95
The shadow of the eclipse is passing off
The full orb of thy destiny! Already
The victor Crescent glitters forth and sheds
O'er the yet lingering haze a phantom light.
Thou canst not hasten it! Leave then to Heaven 100
The work of Heaven: and with a silent spirit
Sympathize with the powers that work in silence!'
Thus spake she, and she looked as she were then
[929]
Fresh from some heavenly vision!


[Re-enter Laska, not perceiving them.


Laska. All asleep!
[Then observing Bethlen, stands in idiot-affright.
I must speak to it first&mdash;Put&mdash;put the question! 105
I'll confess all! [Stammering with fear.

Old Bathory. Laska! what ails thee, man?

Laska (pointing to Bethlen). There!

Old Bathory. I see nothing! where?

Laska. He does not see it!
Bethlen, torment me not!

Bethlen. Soft! Rouse him gently!
He hath outwatched his hour, and half asleep,
With eyes half open, mingles sight with dreams. 110

Old Bathory. Ho! Laska! Don't you know us! 'tis Bathory
And Bethlen!

Laska. Good now! Ha! ha! An excellent trick.
Afraid? Nay, no offence! But I must laugh.
But are you sure now, that 'tis you, yourself?

Bethlen. Would'st be convinced?

Laska. No nearer, pray! consider! 115
If it should prove his ghost, the touch would freeze me
To a tombstone. No nearer!

Bethlen. The fool is drunk!

Laska. Well now! I love a brave man to my heart.
I myself braved the monster, and would fain
Have saved the false one from the fate she tempted. 120

Old Bathory. You, Laska?

Bethlen (to Bathory). Mark! Heaven grant it may be so!
Glycine?

Laska. She! I traced her by the voice.
You'll scarce believe me, when I say I heard
The close of a song: the poor wretch had been singing:
As if she wished to compliment the war-wolf 125
At once with music and a meal!

Bethlen (to Bathory). Mark that!

Laska. At the next moment I beheld her running,
Wringing her hands with, 'Bethlen! O poor Bethlen!'
I almost fear, the sudden noise I made,
[930]
Rushing impetuous through the brake, alarmed her. 130
She stopt, then mad with fear, turned round and ran
Into the monster's gripe. One piteous scream
I heard. There was no second&mdash;I&mdash;

Bethlen. Stop there!
We'll spare your modesty! Who dares not honour
Laska's brave tongue, and high heroic fancy? 135

Laska. You too, Sir Knight, have come back safe and sound!
You played the hero at a cautious distance!
Or was it that you sent the poor girl forward
To stay the monster's stomach? Dainties quickly
Pall on the taste and cloy the appetite! 140

Old Bathory. Laska, beware! Forget not what thou art!
Should'st thou but dream thou'rt valiant, cross thyself!
And ache all over at the dangerous fancy!

Laska. What then! you swell upon my lady's favour,
High Lords and perilous of one day's growth! 145
But other judges now sit on the bench!
And haply, Laska hath found audience there,
Where to defend the treason of a son
Might end in lifting up both son and father
Still higher; to a height from which indeed 150
You both may drop, but, spite of fate and fortune,
Will be secured from falling to the ground.
'Tis possible too, young man! that royal Emerick,
At Laska's rightful suit, may make inquiry
By whom seduced, the maid so strangely missing&mdash; 155

Bethlen. Soft! my good Laska! might it not suffice,
If to yourself, being Lord Casimir's steward,
I should make record of Glycine's fate?

Laska. 'Tis well! it shall content me! though your fear
Has all the credit of these lowered tones. 160
First we demand the manner of her death?

Bethlen. Nay! that's superfluous! Have you not just told us,
That you yourself, led by impetuous valour,
Witnessed the whole? My tale's of later date.
After the fate, from which your valour strove 165
In vain to rescue the rash maid, I saw her!

Laska. Glycine?

Bethlen. Nay! Dare I accuse wise Laska,
Whose words find access to a monarch's ear,
[931]
Of a base, braggart lie? It must have been
Her spirit that appeared to me. But haply 170
I come too late? It has itself delivered
Its own commission to you?

Old Bathory. 'Tis most likely!
And the ghost doubtless vanished, when we entered
And found brave Laska staring wide&mdash;at nothing!

Laska. 'Tis well! You've ready wits! I shall report them, 175
With all due honour, to his Majesty!
Treasure them up, I pray! A certain person,
Whom the king flatters with his confidence,
Tells you, his royal friend asks startling questions!
'Tis but a hint! And now what says the ghost! 180

Bethlen. Listen! for thus it spake: 'Say thou to Laska,
Glycine, knowing all thy thoughts engrossed
In thy new office of king's fool and knave,
Foreseeing thou'lt forget with thine own hand
To make due penance for the wrongs thou'st caused her, 185
For thy soul's safety, doth consent to take it
From Bethlen's cudgel'&mdash;thus. [Beats him off.
Off! scoundrel! off!


[Laska runs away.


Old Bathory. The sudden swelling of this shallow dastard
Tells of a recent storm: the first disruption
Of the black cloud that hangs and threatens o'er us. 190

Bethlen. E'en this reproves my loitering. Say where lies
The oratory?

Old Bathory. Ascend yon flight of stairs!
Midway the corridor a silver lamp
Hangs o'er the entrance of Sarolta's chamber,
And facing it, the low arched oratory! 195
Me thou'lt find watching at the outward gate:
For a petard might burst the bars, unheard
By the drenched porter, and Sarolta hourly
Expects Lord Casimir, spite of Emerick's message!

Bethlen. There I will meet you! And till then good-night! 200
Dear good old man, good-night!

Old Bathory. O yet one moment!
What I repelled, when it did seem my own,
I cling to, now 'tis parting&mdash;call me father!
It can not now mislead thee. O my son,
Ere yet our tongues have learnt another name, 205
[932]
Bethlen!&mdash;say 'Father' to me!

Bethlen. Now, and for ever
My father! other sire than thou, on earth
I never had, a dearer could not have!
From the base earth you raised me to your arms,
And I would leap from off a throne, and kneeling, 210
Ask Heaven's blessing from thy lips. My father!

Bathory. Go! Go! [Exit Bethlen.
May every star now shining over us,
Be as an angel's eye, to watch and guard him! [Exit Bathory.



Scene changes to a splendid Bed-chamber, hung with tapestry.

Sarolta and an Attendant.


Attendant. We all did love her, madam!

Sarolta. She deserved it!
Luckless Glycine! rash, unhappy girl! 215
'Twas the first time she e'er deceived me.

Attendant. She was in love, and had she not died thus,
With grief for Bethlen's loss, and fear of Laska,
She would have pined herself to death at home.

Sarolta. Has the youth's father come back from his search? 220

Attendant. He never will, I fear me. O dear lady!
That Laska did so triumph o'er the old man&mdash;
It was quite cruel&mdash;'You'll be sure,' said he,
'To meet with part at least of your son Bethlen,
Or the war-wolf must have a quick digestion! 225
Go! Search the wood by all means! Go! I pray you!'

Sarolta. Inhuman wretch!

Attendant. And old Bathory answered
With a sad smile, 'It is a witch's prayer,
And may Heaven read it backwards.' Though she was rash,
'Twas a small fault for such a punishment! 230

Sarolta. Nay! 'twas my grief, and not my anger spoke.
Small fault indeed! but leave me, my poor girl!
I feel a weight that only prayer can lighten.
[Exit Attendant.
O they were innocent, and yet have perished
In their May of life; and Vice grows old in triumph. 235
[933]Is it Mercy's hand, that for the bad man holds
Life's closing gate?&mdash;&mdash;
Still passing thence petitionary Hours
To woo the obdurate spirit to repentance?
Or would this dullness tell me, that there is 240
Guilt too enormous to be duly punished,
Save by increase of guilt? The Powers of Evil
Are jealous claimants. Guilt too hath its ordeal,
And Hell its own probation!&mdash;Merciful Heaven,
Rather than this, pour down upon thy suppliant 245
Disease, and agony, and comfortless want!
O send us forth to wander on, unsheltered!
Make our food bitter with despis&eacute;d tears!
Let viperous scorn hiss at us as we pass!
Yea, let us sink down at our enemy's gate, 250
And beg forgiveness and a morsel of bread!
With all the heaviest worldly visitations
Let the dire father's curse that hovers o'er us
Work out its dread fulfilment, and the spirit
Of wronged Kiuprili be appeased. But only, 255
Only, O merciful in vengeance! let not
That plague turn inward on my Casimir's soul!
Scare thence the fiend Ambition, and restore him
To his own heart! O save him! Save my husband!


[During the latter part of this speech Emerick comes forward from his
hiding-place. Sarolta seeing him, without recognising him.


In such a shape a father's curse should come. 260

Emerick (advancing). Fear not.

Sarolta. Who art thou? Robber? Traitor?

Emerick. Friend!
Who in good hour hath startled these dark fancies,
Rapacious traitors, that would fain depose
Joy, love, and beauty, from their natural thrones:
Those lips, those angel eyes, that regal forehead. 265

Sarolta. Strengthen me, Heaven! I must not seem afraid! [Aside.
The king to-night then deigns to play the masker.
What seeks your Majesty?

Emerick. Sarolta's love;
And Emerick's power lies prostrate at her feet.


[934]


Sarolta. Heaven guard the sovereign's power from such debasement! 270
Far rather, Sire, let it descend in vengeance
On the base villain, on the faithless slave
Who dared unbar the doors of these retirements!
For whom? Has Casimir deserved this insult?
O my misgiving heart! If&mdash;if&mdash;from Heaven 275
Yet not from you, Lord Emerick!

Emerick. Chiefly from me.
Has he not like an ingrate robbed my court
Of Beauty's star, and kept my heart in darkness?
First then on him I will administer justice&mdash;
If not in mercy, yet in love and rapture. 280
[Seizes her.

Sarolta. Help! Treason! Help!

Emerick. Call louder! Scream again!
Here's none can hear you!

Sarolta. Hear me, hear me, Heaven!

Emerick. Nay, why this rage? Who best deserves you? Casimir,
Emerick's bought implement, the jealous slave
That mews you up with bolts and bars? or Emerick 285
Who proffers you a throne? Nay, mine you shall be.
Hence with this fond resistance! Yield; then live
This month a widow, and the next a queen!

Sarolta. Yet, yet for one brief moment [Struggling.
Unhand me, I conjure you.


[She throws him off, and rushes towards a toilet. Emerick follows, and
as she takes a dagger, he grasps it in her hand.


Emerick. Ha! Ha! a dagger; 290
A seemly ornament for a lady's casket!
'Tis held, devotion is akin to love,
But yours is tragic! Love in war! It charms me,
And makes your beauty worth a king's embraces!


[During this speech Bethlen enters armed.


Bethlen. Ruffian, forbear! Turn, turn and front my sword! 295

Emerick. Pish! who is this?

Sarolta. O sleepless eye of Heaven!
A blest, a blessed spirit! Whence camest thou?
May I still call thee Bethlen?

Bethlen. Ever, lady,
[935]
Your faithful soldier!

Emerick. Insolent slave! Depart
Know'st thou not me?

Bethlen. I know thou art a villain 300
And coward! That thy devilish purpose marks thee!
What else, this lady must instruct my sword!

Sarolta. Monster, retire! O touch him not, thou blest one!
This is the hour that fiends and damn&eacute;d spirits
Do walk the earth, and take what form they list! 305
Yon devil hath assumed a king's!

Bethlen. Usurped it!

Emerick. The king will play the devil with thee indeed!
But that I mean to hear thee howl on the rack,
I would debase this sword, and lay thee prostrate
At this thy paramour's feet; then drag her forth 310
Stained with adulterous blood, and&mdash;
&mdash;mark you, traitress!
Strumpeted first, then turned adrift to beggary!
Thou prayed'st for't too.

Sarolta. Thou art so fiendish wicked,
That in thy blasphemies I scarce hear thy threats!

Bethlen. Lady, be calm! fear not this king of the buskin! 315
A king? Oh laughter! A king Bajazet!
That from some vagrant actor's tiring-room,
Hath stolen at once his speech and crown!

Emerick. Ah! treason!
Thou hast been lessoned and tricked up for this!
As surely as the wax on thy death-warrant 320
Shall take the impression of this royal signet,
So plain thy face hath ta'en the mask of rebel!


[Bethlen seizes Emerick's hand and eagerly observes the signet.


Bethlen. It must be so! 'Tis e'en the counterpart!
But with a foul usurping cypher on it!
The light hath flashed from Heaven, and I must follow it! 325
O curst usurper! O thou brother-murderer!
That mad'st a star-bright queen a fugitive widow!
Who fill'st the land with curses, being thyself
All curses in one tyrant! see and tremble!
[936]
This is Kiuprili's sword that now hangs o'er thee! 330
Kiuprili's blasting curse, that from its point
Shoots lightnings at thee. Hark! in Andreas' name,
Heir of his vengeance, hell-hound! I defy thee.


[They fight, and just as Emerick is disarmed, in rush Casimir, Old
Bathory, and Attendants. Casimir runs in between the combatants, and
parts them; in the struggle Bethlen's sword is thrown down.


Casimir. The king! disarmed too by a stranger! Speak!
What may this mean?

Emerick. Deceived, dishonored lord! 335
Ask thou yon fair adultress! She will tell thee
A tale, which would'st thou be both dupe and traitor,
Thou wilt believe against thy friend and sovereign!
Thou art present now, and a friend's duty ceases:
To thine own justice leave I thine own wrongs. 340
Of half thy vengeance I perforce must rob thee,
For that the sovereign claims. To thy allegiance
I now commit this traitor and assassin. [Then to the Attendants.
Hence with him to the dungeon! and to-morrow,
Ere the sun rises,&mdash;Hark! your heads or his! 345

Bethlen. Can Hell work miracles to mock Heaven's justice?

Emerick. Who speaks to him dies! The traitor that has menaced
His king, must not pollute the breathing air,
Even with a word!

Casimir (to Bathory). Hence with him to the dungeon!


[Exit Bethlen, hurried off by Bathory and Attendants.


Emerick. We hunt to-morrow in your upland forest: 350
Thou (to Casimir) wilt attend us: and wilt then explain
This sudden and most fortunate arrival.


[Exit Emerick; Manent Casimir and Sarolta.


Sarolta. My lord! my husband! look whose sword lies yonder!
It is Kiuprili's, Casimir; 'tis thy father's!
And wielded by a stripling's arm, it baffled, 355
Yea, fell like Heaven's own lightnings on that Tarquin.

Casimir. Hush! hush!
[937]
I had detected ere I left the city
The tyrant's curst intent. Lewd, damn&eacute;d ingrate!
For him did I bring down a father's curse! 360
Swift, swift must be our means! To-morrow's sun
Sets on his fate or mine! O blest Sarolta!
No other prayer, late penitent, dare I offer,
But that thy spotless virtues may prevail
O'er Casimir's crimes, and dread Kiuprili's curse! 365
[Exeunt.

ACT IV

Scene I

A glade in a wood. Enter Casimir looking anxiously around.


Casimir. This needs must be the spot! O, here he comes!


Enter Lord Rudolph.


Well met, Lord Rudolph!&mdash;&mdash;
Your whisper was not lost upon my ear,
And I dare trust&mdash;

Lord Rudolph. Enough! the time is precious!
You left Temeswar late on yester-eve? 5
And sojourned there some hours?

Casimir. I did so!

Lord Rudolph. Heard you
Aught of a hunt preparing?

Casimir. Yes; and met
The assembled huntsmen!

Lord Rudolph. Was there no word given?

Casimir. The word for me was this:&mdash;The royal Leopard
Chases thy milk-white dedicated Hind. 10

Lord Rudolph. Your answer?

Casimir. As the word proves false or true
Will Casimir cross the hunt, or join the huntsmen!

Lord Rudolph. The event redeemed their pledge?

Casimir. It did, and therefore
Have I sent back both pledge and invitation.
The spotless Hind hath fled to them for shelter, 15
And bears with her my seal of fellowship! [They take hands.


[938]


Lord Rudolph. But Emerick! how when you reported to him
Sarolta's disappearance, and the flight
Of Bethlen with his guards?

Casimir. O he received it
As evidence of their mutual guilt. In fine, 20
With cozening warmth condoled with, and dismissed me.

Lord Rudolph. I entered as the door was closing on you:
His eye was fixed, yet seemed to follow you,&mdash;
With such a look of hate, and scorn and triumph,
As if he had you in the toils already, 25
And were then choosing where to stab you first.
But hush! draw back!

Casimir. This nook is at the furthest
From any beaten track.

Lord Rudolph. There! mark them!


[Points to where Laska and Pestalutz cross the Stage.


Casimir. Laska!

Lord Rudolph. One of the two I recognized this morning;
His name is Pestalutz: a trusty ruffian 30
Whose face is prologue still to some dark murder.
Beware no stratagem, no trick of message,
Dispart you from your servants.

Casimir (aside). I deserve it.
The comrade of that ruffian is my servant:
The one I trusted most and most preferred. 35
But we must part. What makes the king so late?
It was his wont to be an early stirrer.

Lord Rudolph. And his main policy.
To enthral the sluggard nature in ourselves
Is, in good truth, the better half of the secret
To enthral the world: for the will governs all. 40
See, the sky lowers! the cross-winds waywardly
Chase the fantastic masses of the clouds
With a wild mockery of the coming hunt!

Casimir. Mark yonder mass! I make it wear the shape
Of a huge ram that butts with head depressed. 45


[939]


Lord Rudolph (smiling). Belike, some stray sheep of the oozy flock,
Which, if bards lie not, the Sea-shepherds tend,
Glaucus or Proteus. But my fancy shapes it
A monster couchant on a rocky shelf.

Casimir. Mark too the edges of the lurid mass&mdash; 50
Restless, as if some idly-vexing Sprite,
On swift wing coasting by, with tetchy hand
Pluck'd at the ringlets of the vaporous Fleece.
These are sure signs of conflict nigh at hand,
And elemental war! [A single trumpet heard at some distance.

Lord Rudolph. That single blast 55
Announces that the tyrant's pawing courser
Neighs at the gate. [Trumpets.
Hark! now the king comes forth!
For ever 'midst this crash of horns and clarions
He mounts his steed, which proudly rears an-end
While he looks round at ease, and scans the crowd, 60
Vain of his stately form and horsemanship!
I must away! my absence may be noticed.

Casimir. Oft as thou canst, essay to lead the hunt
Hard by the forest-skirts; and ere high noon
Expect our sworn confederates from Temeswar. 65
I trust, ere yet this clouded sun slopes westward,
That Emerick's death, or Casimir's, will appease
The manes of Zapolya and Kiuprili! [Exit Rudolph.
The traitor, Laska!&mdash;&mdash;
And yet Sarolta, simple, inexperienced, 70
Could see him as he was, and often warned me.
Whence learned she this?&mdash;O she was innocent!
And to be innocent is Nature's wisdom!
The fledge-dove knows the prowlers of the air,
Feared soon as seen, and flutters back to shelter. 75
And the young steed recoils upon his haunches,
The never-yet-seen adder's hiss first heard.
O surer than Suspicion's hundred eyes
Is that fine sense, which to the pure in heart,
By mere oppugnancy of their own goodness, 80
Reveals the approach of evil. Casimir!
O fool! O parricide! through yon wood did'st thou,
[940]
With fire and sword, pursue a patriot father,
A widow and an orphan. Dar'st thou then
(Curse-laden wretch) put forth these hands to raise 85
The ark, all sacred, of thy country's cause?
Look down in pity on thy son, Kiuprili!
And let this deep abhorrence of his crime,
Unstained with selfish fears, be his atonement!
O strengthen him to nobler compensation 90
In the deliverance of his bleeding country! [Exit Casimir.



Scene changes to the mouth of a Cavern, as in Act II. Zapolya and
Glycine discovered.


Zapolya. Our friend is gone to seek some safer cave:
Do not then leave me long alone, Glycine!
Having enjoyed thy commune, loneliness,
That but oppressed me hitherto, now scares. 95

Glycine. I shall know Bethlen at the furthest distance,
And the same moment I descry him, lady,
I will return to you. [Exit Glycine.


[Enter Old Bathory, speaking as he enters.


Old Bathory. Who hears? A friend!
A messenger from him who bears the signet!

Zapolya. He hath the watch-word!&mdash;Art thou not Bathory? 100

Old Bathory. O noble lady! greetings from your son!
[Bathory kneels.

Zapolya. Rise! rise! Or shall I rather kneel beside thee,
And call down blessings from the wealth of Heaven
Upon thy honoured head? When thou last saw'st me
I would full fain have knelt to thee, and could not, 105
Thou dear old man! How oft since then in dreams
Have I done worship to thee, as an angel
Bearing my helpless babe upon thy wings!

Old Bathory. O he was born to honour! Gallant deeds
And perilous hath he wrought since yester-eve. 110
[941]
Now from Temeswar (for to him was trusted
A life, save thine, the dearest) he hastes hither&mdash;

Zapolya. Lady Sarolta mean'st thou?

Old Bathory. She is safe.
The royal brute hath overleapt his prey,
And when he turned, a sworded Virtue faced him. 115
My own brave boy&mdash;O pardon, noble lady!
Your son&mdash;&mdash;

Zapolya. Hark! Is it he?

Old Bathory. I hear a voice
Too hoarse for Bethlen's! 'Twas his scheme and hope,
Long ere the hunters could approach the forest,
To have led you hence.&mdash;Retire.

Zapolya. O life of terrors! 120

Old Bathory. In the cave's mouth we have such 'vantage ground
That even this old arm&mdash; [Exeunt Zapolya and Bathory into the cave.


Enter Laska and Pestalutz.


Laska. Not a step further!

Pestalutz. Dastard! was this your promise to the king?

Laska. I have fulfilled his orders. Have walked with you
As with a friend: have pointed out Lord Casimir: 125
And now I leave you to take care of him.
For the king's purposes are doubtless friendly.

Pestalutz. Be on your guard, man!

Laska. Ha! what now?

Pestalutz. Behind you!
'Twas one of Satan's imps, that grinned and threatened you
For your most impudent hope to cheat his master! 130

Laska. Pshaw! What! you think 'tis fear that makes me leave you?

Pestalutz. Is't not enough to play the knave to others,
But thou must lie to thine own heart?

Laska. Friend! Laska will be found at his own post,
Watching elsewhere for the king's interest. 135
There's a rank plot that Laska must hunt down,
'Twixt Bethlen and Glycine!

Pestalutz. What! the girl
[942]
Whom Laska saw the war-wolf tear in pieces?

Laska. Well! Take my arms! Hark! should your javelin fail you,
These points are tipt with venom. [Seeing Glycine without.
By Heaven! Glycine! 140
Now as you love the king, help me to seize her!


[They run out after Glycine. Enter Bathory from the cavern.


Old Bathory. Rest, lady, rest! I feel in every sinew
A young man's strength returning! Which way went they?
The shriek came thence. [Enter Glycine.

Glycine. Ha! weapons here? Then, Bethlen, thy Glycine 145
Will die with thee or save thee!


[She seizes them and rushes out. Bathory following. Music, and
Peasants with hunting spears cross the stage, singing chorally.


CHORAL SONG

Up, up! ye dames, ye lasses gay!
To the meadows trip away.
'Tis you must tend the flocks this morn,
And scare the small birds from the corn. 150
Not a soul at home may stay:
For the shepherds must go
With lance and bow
To hunt the wolf in the woods to-day.

Leave the hearth and leave the house 155
To the cricket and the mouse:
Find grannam out a sunny seat,
With babe and lambkin at her feet.
Not a soul at home may stay:
For the shepherds must go 160
With lance and bow
To hunt the wolf in the woods to-day.

[Exeunt Huntsmen.


[943]
Re-enter Bathory, Bethlen, and Glycine.


Glycine. And now once more a woman&mdash;&mdash;

Bethlen. Was it then
That timid eye, was it those maiden hands
That sped the shaft, which saved me and avenged me? 165

Old Bathory. 'Twas as a vision blazoned on a cloud
By lightning, shaped into a passionate scheme
Of life and death! I saw the traitor, Laska,
Stoop and snatch up the javelin of his comrade;
The point was at your back, when her shaft reached him. 170
The coward turned, and at the self-same instant
The braver villain fell beneath your sword.


[Enter Zapolya.


Zapolya. Bethlen! my child! and safe too!

Bethlen. Mother! Queen.
Royal Zapolya! name me Andreas!
Nor blame thy son, if being a king, he yet 175
Hath made his own arm minister of his justice.
So do the gods who launch the thunderbolt!

Zapolya. O Raab Kiuprili! Friend! Protector! Guide!
In vain we trenched the altar round with waters,
A flash from Heaven hath touched the hidden incense&mdash; 180

Bethlen. And that majestic form that stood beside thee
Was Raab Kiuprili!

Zapolya. It was Raab Kiuprili;
As sure as thou art Andreas, and the king.

Old Bathory. Hail Andreas! hail my king!

Andreas. Stop, thou revered one,
Lest we offend the jealous destinies 185
By shouts ere victory. Deem it then thy duty
To pay this homage, when 'tis mine to claim it.

Glycine. Accept thine hand-maid's service! [Kneeling.

Zapolya. Raise her, son!
O raise her to thine arms! she saved thy life,
And through her love for thee, she saved thy mother's! 190
Hereafter thou shalt know, that this dear maid
Hath other and hereditary claims
Upon thy heart, and with Heaven guarded instinct
[944]
But carried on the work her sire began!

Andreas. Dear maid! more dear thou canst not be! the rest 195
Shall make my love religion. Haste we hence:
For as I reached the skirts of this high forest,
I heard the noise and uproar of the chase,
Doubling its echoes from the mountain foot.

Glycine. Hark! sure the hunt approaches.


[Horn without, and afterwards distant thunder.


Zapolya. O Kiuprili! 200

Old Bathory. The demon-hunters of the middle air
Are in full cry, and scare with arrowy fire
The guilty! Hark! now here, now there, a horn
Swells singly with irregular blast! the tempest
Has scattered them! [Horns at a distance.

Zapolya. O Heavens! where stays Kiuprili? 205

Old Bathory. The wood will be surrounded! leave me here.

Andreas. My mother! let me see thee once in safety.
I too will hasten back, with lightning's speed,
To seek the hero!

Old Bathory. Haste! my life upon it
I'll guide him safe.

Andreas (thunder). Ha! what a crash was there! 210
Heaven seems to claim a mightier criminal
Than yon vile subaltern.

Zapolya. Your behest, High powers,
Lo, I obey! To the appointed spirit,
That hath so long kept watch round this drear cavern,
In fervent faith, Kiuprili, I entrust thee! 215
[Exeunt Zapolya, Andreas, and Glycine.

Old Bathory. Yon bleeding corse may work us mischief still:
Once seen, 'twill rouse alarm and crowd the hunt
From all parts towards this spot. Stript of its armour,
I'll drag it hither.
[Exit Bathory. Several Hunters cross the Stage. Enter Kiuprili.


[945]


Raab Kiuprili (throwing off his disguise). Since Heaven alone can save me, Heaven alone 220
Shall be my trust.
Haste! haste! Zapolya, flee!
Gone! Seized perhaps? Oh no, let me not perish
Despairing of Heaven's justice! Faint, disarmed,
Each sinew powerless; senseless rock, sustain me!
Thou art parcel of my native land!
A sword! 225
Ha! and my sword! Zapolya hath escaped,
The murderers are baffled, and there lives
An Andreas to avenge Kiuprili's fall!&mdash;
There was a time, when this dear sword did flash
As dreadful as the storm-fire from mine arm&mdash; 230
I can scarce raise it now&mdash;yet come, fell tyrant!
And bring with thee my shame and bitter anguish,
To end his work and thine! Kiuprili now
Can take the death-blow as a soldier should.


[Re-enter Bathory, with the dead body of Pestalutz.


Old Bathory. Poor tool and victim of another's guilt! 235
Thou follow'st heavily: a reluctant weight!
Good truth, it is an undeserv&eacute;d honour
That in Zapolya and Kiuprili's cave
A wretch like thee should find a burial-place.
'Tis he!&mdash;In Andreas' and Zapolya's name 240
Follow me, reverend form! Thou need'st not speak,
For thou canst be no other than Kiuprili.

Kiuprili. And are they safe? [Noise without.

Old Bathory. Conceal yourself, my lord!
I will mislead them!

Kiuprili. Is Zapolya safe?

Old Bathory. I doubt it not; but haste, haste, I conjure you! 245


[Enter Casimir.


Casimir. Monster!
Thou shalt not now escape me!

Old Bathory. Stop, lord Casimir!
It is no monster.


[946]


Casimir. Art thou too a traitor?
Is this the place where Emerick's murderers lurk?
Say where is he that, tricked in this disguise, 250
First lured me on, then scared my dastard followers?
Thou must have seen him. Say where is th' assassin?

Old Bathory. There lies the assassin! slain by that same sword
That was descending on his curst employer,
When entering thou beheld'st Sarolta rescued! 255

Casimir. Strange providence! what then was he who fled me?
Thy looks speak fearful things! Whither, old man!
Would thy hand point me?

Old Bathory. Casimir, to thy father.

Casimir. The curse! the curse! Open and swallow me,
Unsteady earth! Fall, dizzy rocks! and hide me! 260

Old Bathory. Speak, speak, my lord!

Kiuprili. Bid him fulfil his work!

Casimir. Thou art Heaven's immediate minister, dread spirit!
O for sweet mercy, take some other form,
And save me from perdition and despair!

Old Bathory. He lives!

Casimir. Lives! A father's curse can never die! 265

Kiuprili. O Casimir! Casimir!

Old Bathory. Look! he doth forgive you!
Hark! 'tis the tyrant's voice. [Emerick's voice without.

Casimir. I kneel, I kneel!
Retract thy curse! O, by my mother's ashes,
Have pity on thy self-abhorring child!
If not for me, yet for my innocent wife, 270
Yet for my country's sake, give my arm strength,
Permitting me again to call thee father!

Kiuprili. Son, I forgive thee! Take thy father's sword;
When thou shalt lift it in thy country's cause,
In that same instant doth thy father bless thee! 275


[Enter Emerick.


Emerick. Fools! Cowards! follow&mdash;or by Hell I'll make you
[947]
Find reason to fear Emerick, more than all
The mummer-fiends that ever masqueraded
As gods or wood-nymphs!&mdash;
Ha! 'tis done then!
Our necessary villain hath proved faithful, 280
And there lies Casimir, and our last fears!
Well!&mdash;Aye, well!&mdash;&mdash;
And is it not well? For though grafted on us,
And filled too with our sap, the deadly power
Of the parent poison-tree lurked in its fibres: 285
There was too much of Raab Kiuprili in him:
The old enemy looked at me in his face,
E'en when his words did flatter me with duty.


Enter Casimir and Bathory.


Old Bathory (aside). This way they come!

Casimir (aside). Hold them in check awhile,
The path is narrow! Rudolph will assist thee. 290

Emerick (aside). And ere I ring the alarum of my sorrow,
I'll scan that face once more, and murmur&mdash;Here
Lies Casimir, the last of the Kiuprilis!
Hell! 'tis Pestalutz!

Casimir (coming forward). Yes, thou ingrate Emerick!
'Tis Pestalutz! 'tis thy trusty murderer! 295
To quell thee more, see Raab Kiuprili's sword!

Emerick. Curses on it and thee! Think'st thou that petty omen
Dare whisper fear to Emerick's destiny?
Ho! Treason! Treason!

Casimir. Then have at thee, tyrant!
[They fight. Emerick falls.

Emerick. Betrayed and baffled 300
By mine own tool!&mdash;&mdash;Oh! [Dies.

Casimir. Hear, hear, my Father!
Thou should'st have witnessed thine own deed. O Father,
Wake from that envious swoon! The tyrant's fallen!
[948]
Thy sword hath conquered! As I lifted it
Thy blessing did indeed descend upon me; 305
Dislodging the dread curse. It flew forth from me
And lighted on the tyrant!


Enter Rudolph, Bathory, and Attendants.


Rudolph and Bathory. Friends! friends to Casimir!

Casimir. Rejoice, Illyrians! the usurper's fallen.

Rudolph. So perish tyrants! so end usurpation! 310

Casimir. Bear hence the body, and move slowly on!
One moment&mdash;&mdash;
Devoted to a joy, that bears no witness,
I follow you, and we will greet our countrymen
With the two best and fullest gifts of heaven&mdash; 315
A tyrant fallen, a patriot chief restored!
[Casimir enters the Cavern.



Scene.&mdash;Chamber in Casimir's Castle. Confederates discovered.


First Confederate. It cannot but succeed, friends. From this palace
E'en to the wood, our messengers are posted
With such short interspace, that fast as sound
Can travel to us, we shall learn the event! 320


Enter another Confederate.


What tidings from Temeswar?

Second Confederate. With one voice
Th' assembled chieftains have deposed the tyrant:
He is proclaimed the public enemy,
And the protection of the law withdrawn.

First Confederate. Just doom for him, who governs without law! 325
Is it known on whom the sov'reignty will fall?

Second Confederate. Nothing is yet decided: but report
Points to Lord Casimir. The grateful memory
Of his renown&eacute;d father&mdash;&mdash;


Enter Sarolta.


Hail to Sarolta!

Sarolta. Confederate friends! I bring to you a joy 330
Worthy your noble cause! Kiuprili lives,
And from his obscure exile, hath returned
[949]
To bless our country. More and greater tidings
Might I disclose; but that a woman's voice
Would mar the wondrous tale. Wait we for him, 335
The partner of the glory&mdash;Raab Kiuprili;
For he alone is worthy to announce it.


[Shouts of 'Kiuprili, Kiuprili,' and 'The Tyrant's fallen,'
without. Enter Kiuprili, Casimir, Rudolph, Bathory, and Attendants.


Raab Kiuprili. Spare yet your joy, my friends! A higher waits you:
Behold, your Queen!


[Enter Zapolya and Andreas royally attired, with Glycine.


Confederate. Comes she from heaven to bless us?

Other Confederates. It is! it is!

Zapolya. Heaven's work of grace is full! 340
Kiuprili, thou art safe!

Raab Kiuprili. Royal Zapolya!
To the heavenly powers, pay we our duty first;
Who not alone preserved thee, but for thee
And for our country, the one precious branch
Of Andreas' royal house. O countrymen, 345
Behold your King! And thank our country's genius,
That the same means which have preserved our sovereign,
Have likewise reared him worthier of the throne
By virtue than by birth. The undoubted proofs
Pledged by his royal mother, and this old man, 350
(Whose name henceforth be dear to all Illyrians)
We haste to lay before the assembled council.

All. Hail, Andreas! Hail, Illyria's rightful king!

Andreas. Supported thus, O friends! 'twere cowardice
Unworthy of a royal birth, to shrink 355
From the appointed charge. Yet, while we wait
The awful sanction of convened Illyria,
In this brief while, O let me feel myself
The child, the friend, the debtor!&mdash;Heroic mother!&mdash;
But what can breath add to that sacred name? 360
Kiuprili! gift of Providence, to teach us
That loyalty is but the public form
Of the sublimest friendship, let my youth
Climb round thee, as the vine around its elm:
[950]
Thou my support and I thy faithful fruitage. 365
My heart is full, and these poor words express not,
They are but an art to check its over-swelling.
Bathory! shrink not from my filial arms!
Now, and from henceforth thou shalt not forbid me
To call thee father! And dare I forget 370
The powerful intercession of thy virtue,
Lady Sarolta? Still acknowledge me
Thy faithful soldier!&mdash;But what invocation
Shall my full soul address to thee, Glycine?
Thou sword that leap'dst forth from a bed of roses: 375
Thou falcon-hearted dove?

Zapolya. Hear that from me, son!
For ere she lived, her father saved thy life,
Thine, and thy fugitive mother's!

Casimir. Chef Ragozzi!
O shame upon my head! I would have given her
To a base slave!

Zapolya. Heaven overruled thy purpose, 380
And sent an angel to thy house to guard her!
Thou precious bark! freighted with all our treasures!
The sports of tempests, and yet ne'er the victim,
How many may claim salvage in thee! Take her, son!
A queen that brings with her a richer dowry 385
Than orient kings can give!

Sarolta. A banquet waits!&mdash;
On this auspicious day, for some few hours
I claim to be your hostess. Scenes so awful
With flashing light, force wisdom on us all!
E'en women at the distaff hence may see, 390
That bad men may rebel, but ne'er be free;
May whisper, when the waves of faction foam,
None love their country, but who love their home:
For freedom can with those alone abide,
Who wear the golden chain, with honest pride, 395
Of love and duty, at their own fire-side:
While mad ambition ever doth caress
Its own sure fate, in its own restlessness!


END OF ZAPOLYA.

Casimir. Mark too, the edges of yon lurid mass!
Restless and vext, as if some angering hand,
With fitful, tetchy snatch, unrolled and pluck'd
The jetting ringlets of the vaporous fleece!
These are sure signs of conflict nigh at hand,
And elemental war!

Drops at the threshold, and forgets its message,
A something round me of a wider reach
Feels his approach, and trembles back to tell me.

And left it sticking in Sangrado's heart.

JOB'S LUCK



Sly Beelzebub took all occasions
To try Job's constancy and patience;
He took his honours, took his health,
He took his children, took his wealth,
His camels, horses, asses, cows&mdash;
And the sly Devil did not take his spouse.

But Heaven that brings out good from evil,
And loves to disappoint the Devil,
Had predetermined to restore
Twofold all Job had before,
His children, camels, horses, cows,&mdash;
Short-sighted Devil, not to take his spouse!

Hiobs Weib; er h&auml;tte nimmer einen bessern aufgetrieben.'


The second stanza is adapted from Fr. v. Logan's Sinngedicht, Auf den
Hornutus, ibid. Bk. I, No. 68:&mdash;


'Hornutus las, was Gott Job habe weggenommen,
Sei doppelt ihm hernach zu Hause wiederkommen:
Wie gut, sprach er, war dies, dass Gott sein Weib nicht nahm,
Auf dass Job ihrer zwei f&uuml;r eine nicht bekam!'

Scarce any scandal, but has a handle;
In truth most falsehoods have their rise;
Truth first unlocks Pandora's box,
And out there fly a host of lies.

To precipices it decoys one!
One nectar-drop from Jove's own shop
Will flavour a whole cup of poison.

Old Harpy jeers at castles in the air,
And thanks his stars, whenever Edmund speaks,
That such a dupe as that is not his heir&mdash;

Always amuse, and sometimes mend the heart:
A young man's idlest hopes are still his pleasures,
And fetch a higher price in Wisdom's mart
Than all the unenjoying Miser's treasures.

EPITAPH ON A MERCENARY MISER


A poor benighted Pedlar knock'd
One night at Sell-all's door,
The same who saved old Sell-all's life&mdash;
'Twas but the year before!
And Sell-all rose and let him in,
Not utterly unwilling,
But first he bargain'd with the man,
And took his only shilling!
That night he dreamt he'd given away his pelf,
Walk'd in his sleep, and sleeping hung himself!
And now his soul and body rest below;
And here they say his punishment and fate is
To lie awake and every hour to know
How many people read his tombstone gratis.

FROM AN OLD GERMAN POET


That France has put us oft to rout
With powder, which ourselves found out;
And laughs at us for fools in print,
Of which our genius was the Mint;
All this I easily admit,
For we have genius, France has wit.
But 'tis too bad, that blind and mad
To Frenchmen's wives each travelling German goes,
Expands his manly vigour by their sides,
Becomes the father of his country's foes
And turns their warriors oft to parricides.

ON THE CURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE,

THAT IN THE GERMAN LANGUAGE THE SUN IS FEMININE, AND
THE MOON IS MASCULINE


Our English poets, bad and good, agree
To make the Sun a male, the Moon a she.
He drives his dazzling diligence on high,
In verse, as constantly as in the sky;
And cheap as blackberries our sonnets shew
The Moon, Heaven's huntress, with her silver bow;
By which they'd teach us, if I guess aright,
Man rules the day, and woman rules the night.
In Germany, they just reverse the thing;
The Sun becomes a queen, the Moon a king.
[969]
Now, that the Sun should represent the women,
The Moon the men, to me seem'd mighty humming;
And when I first read German, made me stare.
Surely it is not that the wives are there
As common as the Sun, to lord and loon,
And all their husbands horn&eacute;d as the Moon.

Wernicke's Epigrams (Bk. VII, No. 15), Die Sonne und der Mond.

SPOTS IN THE SUN


My father confessor is strict and holy,
Mi Fili, still he cries, peccare noli.
And yet how oft I find the pious man
At Annette's door, the lovely courtesan!
Her soul's deformity the good man wins
And not her charms! he comes to hear her sins!
Good father! I would fain not do thee wrong;
But ah! I fear that they who oft and long
Stand gazing at the sun, to count each spot,
Must sometimes find the sun itself too hot.

ON PITT AND FOX


Britannia's boast, her glory and her pride,
Pitt in his Country's service lived and died:
At length resolv'd, like Pitt had done, to do,
For once to serve his Country, Fox died too!


First published by Mr. B. Dobell in the Athen&aelig;um, Jan. 6, 1904. This
[971]epigram belongs to the same MS. source as the preceding, 'On the Taste
of the Times,' and may have been the composition of S. T. C.

In Fugitive Pieces (1806) (see P. W., 1898, i. 34) Byron published a
reply 'for insertion in the Morning Chronicle to the following
illiberal impromptu on the death of Mr. Fox, which appeared in the
Morning Post [Sept. 26, 1806]:&mdash;


"Our Nation's Foes lament on Fox's death,
But bless the hour when Pitt resigned his breath:
These feelings wide let Sense and Truth unclue,
We give the palm where Justice points its due."'


I have little doubt that this 'illiberal impromptu' was published by S.
T. C., who had just returned from Italy and was once more writing for
the press. It is possible that he veiled his initials in the line, 'Let
Sense and Truth unClue.'

FOOTNOTES:

[951:1] A great, perhaps the greater, number of Coleridge's
Epigrams are adaptations from the German of Wernicke, Lessing, and other
less known epigrammatists. They were sent to the Morning Post and
other periodicals to supply the needs of the moment, and with the rarest
exceptions they were deliberately excluded from the collected editions
of his poetical works which received his own sanction, and were
published in his lifetime. Collected for the first time by Mrs. H. N.
Coleridge and reprinted in the third volume of Essays on His Own Times
(1850), they have been included, with additions and omissions, in P.
and D. W., 1877-1880, P. W., 1885, P. W., 1890, and the Illustrated
Edition of Coleridge's Poems, issued in 1907. The adaptations from the
German were written and first published between 1799 and 1802. Of the
earlier and later epigrams the greater number are original. Four
epigrams were published anonymously in The Watchman, in April, 1796.
Seventeen epigrams, of which twelve are by Coleridge, two by Southey,
and three by Tobin, were published anonymously in the Annual Anthology
of 1800. Between January 2, 1798, and October 11, 1802 Coleridge
contributed at least thirty-eight epigrams to the Morning Post. Most
of these epigrams appeared under the well-known signature &#917;&#931;&#932;&#919;&#931;&#917;.
Six epigrams, of which five had been published in the Morning
Post, were included in The Friend (No. 11, Oct. 26, 1809). Finally,
Coleridge contributed six epigrams to the Keepsake, of which four had
been published in the Morning Post, and one in the Annual Anthology.
Epigrams were altogether excluded from Sibylline Leaves and from the
three-volume editions of 1828 and 1829; but in 1834 the rule was relaxed
and six epigrams were allowed to appear. Two of these, In An Album
('Parry seeks the Polar Ridge') and On an Insignificant (''Tis Cypher
lies beneath this Crust') were published for the first time.

For the discovery of the German originals of some twenty epigrams, now
for the first time noted and verified, I am indebted to the generous
assistance of Dr. Hermann Georg Fiedler, Taylorian Professor of the
German Language and Literature at Oxford, and of my friend Miss
Katharine Schlesinger.

[953:1] N.B. Bad in itself, and, as Bob Allen used to say of
his puns, looks damned ugly upon paper.

[954:1] Lines 3, 4, with the heading 'On an Insignificant,'
were written by S. T. C. in Southey's copy of the Omniana of 1812 [see
nos. 9, 11]. See P. W., 1885, ii. 402, Note.

[961:1] The antithesis was, perhaps, borrowed from an Epigram
entitled 'Posthumous Fame', included in Elegant Extracts, ii. 260.


If on his spacious marble we rely,
Pity a worth like his should ever die!
If credit to his real life we give,
Pity a wretch like him should ever live.



[962:1] The first and second versions are included in Essays,
&amp;c., 1850, iii. 976: the third version was first published in 1893.

In 1830 Coleridge re-wrote (he did not publish) the second version as an
Epitaph on Hazlitt. The following apologetic note was affixed:&mdash;

'With a sadness at heart, and an earnest hope grounded on his
misanthropic sadness, when I first knew him in his twentieth or
twenty-first year, that a something existed in his bodily organism that
in the sight of the All-Merciful lessened his responsibility, and the
moral imputation of his acts and feelings.' MS.

[964:1] The 'One who published' was, perhaps, Charles Lloyd, in
his novel, Edmund Oliver, 2 vols. 1798. Compare the following Epigram
of Prior's:&mdash;


To John I ow'd great obligation,
But John unhappily thought fit
To publish it to all the nation:
Sure John and I are more than quit.



[974:1] Extempore, in reply to a question of Mr. Theodore
Hook's&mdash;'Look at him, and say what you think: Is not he like a Rose?'

MY GODMOTHER'S BEARD[976:1]


So great the charms of Mrs. Mundy,
That men grew rude, a kiss to gain:
This so provok'd the dame that one day
To Pallas chaste she did complain:

Nor vainly she address'd her prayer,
Nor vainly to that power applied;
The goddess bade a length of hair
In deep recess her muzzle hide:

Still persevere! to love be callous!
For I have your petition heard!
To snatch a kiss were vain (cried Pallas)
Unless you first should shave your beard.


? 1791

First published in Table Talk and Omniana, 1888, p. 392. The lines
were inscribed by Coleridge in Gillman's copy of the Omniana of 1812.
An apologetic note is attached. J. P. Collier (Old Man's Diary, 1871,
March 5, 1832, Part I, p. 34) says that Coleridge 'recited the following
not very good epigram by him on his godmother's beard; the consequence
of which was that he was struck out of her will'. Most probably the
lines, as inscribed on the margin of Omniana, were written about 1830
or 1831. First collected in Coleridge's Poems, 1907.

That wakes the Tear, yet steals away the Pang,
Then, or with Berkeley, or with Hobbes romance it,
Dissecting Truth with metaphysic lancet.
Or, drawn from up these dark unfathom'd wells,
In wiser folly chink the Cap and Bells.
How many tales we told! what jokes we made,
Conundrum, Crambo, Rebus, or Charade;
&AElig;nigmas that had driven the Theban mad,
And Puns, these best when exquisitely bad;
And I, if aught of archer vein I hit,
With my own laughter stifled my own wit.

TO A WELL-KNOWN MUSICAL CRITIC, REMARKABLE
FOR HIS EARS STICKING THROUGH HIS HAIR.


O &mdash;&mdash;! O &mdash;&mdash;! of you we complain
For exposing those ears to the wind and the rain.
Thy face, a huge whitlow just come to a head,
Ill agrees with those ears so raw and so red.

A Musical Critic of old fell a-pouting
When he saw how his asinine honours were sprouting;
But he hid 'em quite snug, in a full friz of hair,
And the Barber alone smoked his donkeys [so] rare.

Thy judgment much worse, and thy perkers as ample,
O give heed to King Midas, and take his example.
Thus to publish your fate is as useless as wrong&mdash;
You but prove by your ears, what we guessed from your tongue.

May the Itch in pomp of scabbage

TO BE SUNG BY THE LOVERS OF ALL THE NOBLE LIQUORS COMPRISED
UNDER THE NAME OF ALE.



A.

Ye drinkers of Stingo and Nappy so free,
Are the Gods on Olympus so happy as we?

B.

They cannot be so happy!
For why? they drink no Nappy.

[979]
A.

But what if Nectar, in their lingo,
Is but another name for Stingo?

B.

Why, then we and the Gods are equally blest,
And Olympus an Ale-house as good as the best!

DRINKING versus THINKING

OR, A SONG AGAINST THE NEW PHILOSOPHY


My Merry men all, that drink with glee
This fanciful Philosophy,
Pray tell me what good is it?
If antient Nick should come and take,
The same across the Stygian Lake,
I guess we ne'er should miss it.

Away, each pale, self-brooding spark
That goes truth-hunting in the dark,
Away from our carousing!
To Pallas we resign such fowls&mdash;
Grave birds of wisdom! ye're but owls,
And all your trade but mousing!

My merry men all, here's punch and wine,
And spicy bishop, drink divine!
Let's live while we are able.
While Mirth and Sense sit, hand in glove,
This Don Philosophy we'll shove
Dead drunk beneath the table!

Onward and onward.

TO CAPTAIN FINDLAY


When the squalls were flitting and fleering
And the vessel was tacking and veering;
Bravo! Captain Findlay,
Who foretold a fair wind
Of a constant mind;
For he knew which way the wind lay,
Bravo! Captain Findlay.

A Health to Captain Findlay,
Bravo! Captain Findlay!
When we made but ill speed with the Speedwell,
Neither poets nor sheep could feed well:
Now grief rotted the Liver,
Yet Malta, dear Malta, as far off as ever!

Bravo! Captain Findlay,
Foretold a fair wind,
Of a constant mind,
For he knew which way the wind lay!

ON DONNE'S POEM 'TO A FLEA'


Be proud as Spaniards! Leap for pride ye Fleas!
Henceforth in Nature's mimic World grandees.
In Ph&oelig;bus' archives registered are ye,
And this your patent of Nobility.
No skip-Jacks now, nor civiller skip-Johns,
Dread Anthropophagi! specks of living bronze,
[981]
I hail you one and all, sans Pros or Cons,
Descendants from a noble race of Dons.
What tho' that great ancestral Flea be gone,
Immortal with immortalising Donne,
His earthly spots bleached off a Papist's gloze,
In purgatory fire on Bardolph's nose.

The following burlesque on the Fichtean Egoismus may, perhaps, be
amusing to the few who have studied the system, and to those who are
unacquainted with it, may convey as tolerable a likeness of Fichte's
idealism as can be expected from an avowed caricature. [S. T. C.]

The Categorical Imperative, or the annunciation of the New Teutonic God,
&#917;&#915;&#937;&#917;&#925;&#922;&#913;&#921;&#928;&#913;&#925;: a dithyrambic Ode, by Querkopf Von Klubstick,
Grammarian, and Subrector in Gymnasio.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.


Eu! Dei vices gerens, ipse Divus,
(Speak English, Friend!) the God Imperativus,
Here on this market-cross aloud I cry:
'I, I, I! I itself I!
[982]
The form and the substance, the what and the why,
The when and the where, and the low and the high,
The inside and outside, the earth and the sky,
I, you, and he, and he, you and I,
All souls and all bodies are I itself I!
All I itself I!
(Fools! a truce with this starting!)
All my I! all my I!
He's a heretic dog who but adds Betty Martin!'
Thus cried the God with high imperial tone:
In robe of stiffest state, that scoff'd at beauty,
A pronoun-verb imperative he shone&mdash;
Then substantive and plural-singular grown,
He thus spake on:&mdash;'Behold in I alone
(For Ethics boast a syntax of their own)
Or if in ye, yet as I doth depute ye,
In O! I, you, the vocative of duty!
I of the world's whole Lexicon the root!
Of the whole universe of touch, sound, sight,
The genitive and ablative to boot:
The accusative of wrong, the nom'native of right,
And in all cases the case absolute!
Self-construed, I all other moods decline:
Imperative, from nothing we derive us;
Yet as a super-postulate of mine,
Unconstrued antecedence I assign,
To X Y Z, the God Infinitivus!'

THE BRIDGE STREET COMMITTEE


Jack Snipe
Eats Tripe:
It is therefore credible
That tripe is edible.
And therefore, perforce,
It follows, of course,
That the Devil will gripe
All who do not eat Tripe.

And as Nic is too slow
To fetch 'em below:
[983]
And Gifford, the attorney,
Won't quicken their journey;
The Bridge-Street Committee
That colleague without pity,
To imprison and hang
Carlile and his gang,
Is the pride of the City,
And 'tis Association
That, alone, saves the Nation
From Death and Damnation.

TO SUSAN STEELE ON RECEIVING THE PURSE

EXTRUMPERY LINES


My dearest Dawtie!
That's never naughty&mdash;
When the Mare was stolen, and not before,
The wise man got a stable-door:
And he and I are brother Ninnies,
One Beast he lost and I two guineas;
And as sure as it's wet when it above rains,
The man's brains and mine both alike had thick coverings,
For if he lost one mare, poor I lost two sovereigns!
A cash-pouch I have got, but no cash to put in it,
Tho' there's gold in the world and Sir Walter can win it:
For your sake I'll keep it for better or worse,
So here is a dear loving kiss for your purse.

Napoleon's mighty hosts from Moscow lost,
Driven forth to perish in the fangs of Frost.

Down Skinner Street I took my hasty way&mdash;
Mischief and Frost had set the boys at play;
I stept upon a slide&mdash;oh! treacherous tread!&mdash;
Fell smash with bottom bruised, and brake my head!
Thus Time's co-presence links the great and small,
Napoleon's overthrow, and Snipkin's fall.

VERSES TRIVOCULAR


Of one scrap of science I've evidence ocular.
A heart of one chamber they call unilocular,
And in a sharp frost, or when snow-flakes fall floccular,
Your wise man of old wrapp'd himself in a Roquelaure,
Which was called a Wrap-rascal when folks would be jocular.
And shell-fish, the small, Periwinkle and Cockle are,
So with them will I finish these verses trivocular.

CHOLERA CURED BEFORE-HAND

Or a premonition promulgated gratis for the use of the Useful Classes,
specially those resident in St. Giles's, Saffron Hill, Bethnal Green,
etc.; and likewise, inasmuch as the good man is merciful even to the
beasts, for the benefit of the Bulls and Bears of the Stock Exchange.


Pains ventral, subventral,
In stomach or entrail,
Think no longer mere prefaces
For grins, groans, and wry faces;
But off to the doctor, fast as ye can crawl! 5
Yet far better 'twould be not to have them at all.

Now to 'scape inward aches,
Eat no plums nor plum-cakes;
Cry avaunt! new potato&mdash;
And don't drink, like old Cato. 10
Ah! beware of Dispipsy,
And don't ye get tipsy!
For tho' gin and whiskey
May make you feel frisky,
[986]
They're but crimps to Dispipsy; 15
And nose to tail, with this gipsy
Comes, black as a porpus,
The diabolus ipse,
Call'd Cholery Morpus;
Who with horns, hoofs, and tail, croaks for carrion to feed him, 20
Tho' being a Devil, no one never has seed him!

Ah! then my dear honies,
There's no cure for you
For loves nor for monies:&mdash;
You'll find it too true. 25
Och! the hallabaloo!
Och! och! how you'll wail,
When the offal-fed vagrant
Shall turn you as blue
As the gas-light unfragrant, 30
That gushes in jets from beneath his own tail;&mdash;
'Till swift as the mail,
He at last brings the cramps on,
That will twist you like Samson.
So without further blethring, 35
Dear mudlarks! my brethren!
Of all scents and degrees,
(Yourselves and your shes)
Forswear all cabal, lads,
Wakes, unions, and rows, 40
Hot dreams and cold salads,
And don't pig in styes that would suffocate sows!
Quit Cobbett's, O'Connell's and Beelzebub's banners,
And whitewash at once bowels, rooms, hands, and manners!

TO BABY BATES


You come from o'er the waters,
From famed Columbia's land,
And you have sons and daughters,
And money at command.

But I live in an island,
Great Britain is its name,
With money none to buy land,
The more it is the shame.

But we are all the children
Of one great God of Love,
Whose mercy like a mill-drain
Runs over from above.

Lullaby, lullaby,
Sugar-plums and cates,
Close your little peeping eye,
Bonny Baby B&mdash;&mdash;s.


First collected 1893. 'Baby Bates' was the daughter of Joshua Bates, one

me out of her will.' S. T. C.

HYMNS&mdash;MOON

In a cave in the mountains of Cashmeer, an image of ice, which
makes its appearance thus: Two days before the new moon there
appears a bubble of ice, which increases in size every day
till the fifteenth day, at which it is an ell or more in
height;&mdash;then, as the moon decreases the Image does also till
it vanishes. Mem. Read the whole 107th page of Maurice's
Indostan.

FOOTNOTES:

[988:1] One of the earliest of Coleridge's Notebooks, which
fell into the hands of his old schoolfellow, John Mathew Gutch, the
printer and proprietor of Felix Farley's Bristol Journal, was
purchased by the Trustees of the British Museum in 1868, and is now
included in Add. MSS. as No. 27901. The fragments of verse contained
in the notebook are included in P. W. 1893, pp. 453-8. The notebook as
a whole was published by Professor A. Brandl in 1896 (S. T. Coleridge's
Notizbuch aus den Jahren 1795-1798). Nineteen entries are included by
H. N. Coleridge in Poems and Poetical Fragments published in Literary
Remains, 1836, i. 277-80.

[988:2] An incorrect version of the lines was published in
Lit. Rem., ii. 280.

With arching Wings, the sea-mew o'er my head
Posts on, as bent on speed, now passaging
Edges the stiffer Breeze, now, yielding, drifts,
Now floats upon the air, and sends from far
A wildly-wailing Note.

A BECK IN WINTER[998:1]


Over the broad, the shallow, rapid stream,
The Alder, a vast hollow Trunk, and ribb'd&mdash;
All mossy green with mosses manifold,
And ferns still waving in the river-breeze
[999]Sent out, like fingers, five projecting trunks&mdash;
The shortest twice 6 (?) of a tall man's strides.&mdash;
One curving upward in its middle growth
Rose straight with grove of twigs&mdash;a pollard tree:&mdash;
The rest more backward, gradual in descent&mdash;
One in the brook and one befoamed its waters:
One ran along the bank in the elk-like head
And pomp of antlers&mdash;

FRAGMENT OF AN ODE ON NAPOLEON


O'erhung with yew, midway the Muses mount
From thy sweet murmurs far, O Hippocrene!
Turbid and black upboils an angry fount
Tossing its shatter'd foam in vengeful spleen&mdash;
Phlegethon's rage Cocytus' wailings hoarse
Alternate now, now mixt, made known its headlong course:
Thither with terror stricken and surprise,
(For sure such haunts were ne'er to Muse's choice)
Euterpe led me. Mute with asking eyes
I stood expectant of her heavenly voice.
Her voice entranc'd my terror and made flow
In a rude understrain the maniac fount below.
'Whene'er (the Goddess said) abhorr'd of Jove
Usurping Power his hands in blood imbrues&mdash;

I have experienced
The worst the world can wreak on me&mdash;the worst
That can make Life indifferent, yet disturb
With whisper'd discontent the dying prayer&mdash;
I have beheld the whole of all, wherein
My heart had any interest in this life
To be disrent and torn from off my Hopes
[1005]
That nothing now is left. Why then live on?
That hostage that the world had in its keeping
Given by me as a pledge that I would live&mdash;
That hope of Her, say rather that pure Faith
In her fix'd Love, which held me to keep truce
With the tyranny of Life&mdash;is gone, ah! whither?
What boots it to reply? 'tis gone! and now
Well may I break this Pact, this league of Blood
That ties me to myself&mdash;and break I shall.

His own fair countenance, his kingly forehead,
His tender smiles, Love's day-dawn on his lips,
Put on such heavenly, spiritual light,

Were Virtue's native crest, th' innocent soul's
Unconscious meek self-heraldry,&mdash;to man
Genial, and pleasant to his guardian angel.
He suffer'd nor complain'd;&mdash;though oft with tears
[1006]
He mourn'd th' oppression of his helpless brethren,&mdash;
And sometimes with a deeper holier grief
Mourn'd for the oppressor&mdash;but this in sabbath hours&mdash;
A solemn grief, that like a cloud at sunset,
Was but the veil of inward meditation
Pierced thro' and saturate with the intellectual rays

[ARS POETICA]

In the two following lines, for instance, there is nothing
objectionable, nothing which would preclude them from forming, in their
proper place, part of a descriptive poem:&mdash;


'Behold yon row of pines, that shorn and bow'd
Bend from the sea-blast, seen at twilight eve.'


But with a small alteration of rhythm, the same words would be equally
in their place in a book of topography, or in a descriptive tour. The
same image will rise into a semblance of poetry if thus conveyed:&mdash;


'Yon row of bleak and visionary pines,
By twilight-glimpse discerned, mark! how they flee
From the fierce sea-blast, all their tresses wild
Streaming before them.'

I [S. T. C.] find the following lines among my papers, in my own
writing, but whether an unfinished fragment, or a contribution to some
friend's production, I know not:&mdash;


What boots to tell how o'er his grave
She wept, that would have died to save;
Little they know the heart, who deem
Her sorrow but an infant's dream
Of transient love begotten;
A passing gale, that as it blows
Just shakes the ripe drop from the rose&mdash;
That dies and is forgotten.
[1012]
O Woman! nurse of hopes and fears,
All lovely in thy spring of years,
Thy soul in blameless mirth possessing,
Most lovely in affliction's tears,
More lovely still than tears suppressing.


Undated. First published in Allsop's Letters, Conversations, &amp;c. First
collected P. and D. W., 1877, ii. 373.

THE THREE SORTS OF FRIENDS


Though friendships differ endless in degree,
The sorts, methinks, may be reduced to three.
Acquaintance many, and Conquaintance few;
But for Inquaintance I know only two&mdash;
The friend I've mourned with, and the maid I woo!


My dear Gillman&mdash;The ground and mat&eacute;riel of this division of one's
friends into ac, con and inquaintance, was given by Hartley
Coleridge when he was scarcely five years old [1801]. On some one asking
him if Anny Sealy (a little girl he went to school with) was an
acquaintance of his, he replied, very fervently pressing his right hand
on his heart, 'No, she is an inquaintance!' 'Well! 'tis a father's
tale'; and the recollection soothes your old friend and inquaintance,

S. T. Coleridge.

If fair by Nature
She honours the fair Boon with fair adorning,
And graces that bespeak a gracious breeding,
Can gracious Nature lessen Nature's Graces?
If taught by both she betters both and honours
Fair gifts with fair adorning, know you not
There is a beauty that resides within;&mdash;
A fine and delicate spirit of womanhood
Of inward birth?&mdash;

A SIMILE


As the shy hind, the soft-eyed gentle Brute
Now moves, now stops, approaches by degrees&mdash;
At length emerges from the shelt'ring Trees,
Lur'd by her Hunter with the Shepherd's flute,
Whose music travelling on the twilight breeze,
When all besides was mute&mdash;
She oft had heard, and ever lov'd to hear;
She fearful Beast! but that no sound of Fear&mdash;&mdash;

BARON GUELPH OF ADELSTAN. A FRAGMENT


For ever in the world of Fame
We live and yet abide the same:
Clouds may intercept our rays,
Or desert Lands reflect our blaze.

The beauteous Month of May began,
And all was Mirth and Sport,
When Baron Guelph of Adelstan
Took leave and left the Court.

From F&ecirc;te and Rout and Opera far
The full town he forsook,
And changed his wand and golden star
For Shepherd's Crown and Crook.

The knotted net of light and shade
Beneath the budding tree,
A sweeter day-bed for him made
Than Couch and Canopy.

In copse or lane, as Choice or Chance
Might lead him was he seen;
And join'd at eve the village dance
Upon the village green.

Nor endless&mdash;

FOOTNOTES:

[996:1] The following 'Fragments', numbered 1-63, consist of a
few translations and versicles inserted by Coleridge in his various
prose works, and a larger number of fragments, properly so called, which
were published from MS. sources in 1893, or are now published for the
first time. These fragments are taken exclusively from Coleridge's
Notebooks (the source of Anima Poet&aelig;, 1895), and were collected,
transcribed, and dated by the present Editor for publication in 1893.
The fragments now published for the first time were either not used by
J. D. Campbell in 1893, or had not been discovered or transcribed. The
very slight emendations of the text are due to the fact that Mr.
Campbell printed from copies, and that the collection as a whole has now
for the second time been collated with the original MSS. Fragments
numbered 64, 96, 98, 111, 113, in P. W., 1893, are quotations from the
plays and poems of William Cartwright (1611-1643). They are not included
in the present issue. Fragments 56, 58, 59, 61, 63, 67, 80, 81, 83, 88,
91, 93, 94, 117-120, are inserted in the text or among 'Jeux d'Esprit',
or under other headings. The chronological order is for the most part
conjectural, and differs from that suggested in 1893. It must be borne
in mind that the entries in Coleridge's Notebooks are not continuous,
and that the additional matter in prose or verse was inserted from time
to time, wherever a page or half a page was not filled up. It follows
that the context is an uncertain guide to the date of any given entry.
Pains have been taken to exclude quotations from older writers, which
Coleridge neither claimed nor intended to claim for his own, but it is
possible that two or three of these fragments of verse are not
original.

[996:2] This quatrain, described as 'The concluding stanza of
an Elegy on a Lady who died in Early Youth', is from part of a
memorandum in S. T. C.'s handwriting headed 'Relics of my School-boy
Muse; i. e. fragments of poems composed before my fifteenth year'. It
follows First Advent of Love, 'O fair is Love's first hope,' &amp;c. (vide
ante, p. 443), and is compared with Age&mdash;a stanza written forty years
later than the preceding&mdash;'Dewdrops are the gems of morning,' &amp;c. (p.
440).

Another Version.


O'er her piled grave the gale of evening sighs,
And flowers will grow upon its grassy slope,
I wipe the dimming waters from mine eye
Even on the cold grave dwells the Cherub Hope.


Unpublished Letter to Thomas Poole, Feb. 1. 1801, on the death of Mrs.
Robinson ('Perdita').

[997:1] These two lines, slightly altered, were afterwards
included in Alice du Clos (ll. 111, 112), ante, p. 473.

[998:1] The lines are an attempt to reduce to blank verse one
of many minute descriptions of natural objects and scenic effects. The
concluding lines are illegible.

[1001:1] These lines, 'slip torn from some old letter,' are
endorsed by Poole, 'Reply of Coleridge on my urging him to exert
himself.' First collected in 1893.

[1007:1] The translation is embodied in a marginal note on the
following quotation from The Select Discourses by John Smith, 1660:&mdash;

'So the Sibyl was noted by Heraclitus as  ins class="greek" title="mainomen&ocirc; stomati
gelasta kai akall&ocirc;pista phthengomen&ecirc;">&#956;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#8179; &#963;&#964;&#8057;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953; &#947;&#949;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8048; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7936;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#8061;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945; &#966;&#952;&#949;&#947;&#947;&#959;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#951;, as one speaking ridiculous and
unseemly speeches with her furious mouth.' The fragment is misquoted
and misunderstood: for &#947;&#949;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8049;, etc. should be
&#7936;&#956;&#8059;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#945; unperfumed, inornate lays, not redolent of art.&mdash;Render it
thus:


Not her's, etc.
&#931;&#964;&#8057;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953; &#956;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#8179; is 'with ecstatic mouth'.


J. D. Campbell in a note to this Fragment (P. W., 1893, pp. 464-5)
quotes the 'following prose translation of the same passage', from
Coleridge's Statesman's Manual (1816, p. 132); 'Multiscience (or a
variety and quantity of acquired knowledge) does not test intelligence.
But the Sibyll with wild enthusiastic mirth shrilling forth unmirthful,
inornate and unperfumed truths, reaches to a thousand years with her
voice through the power of God.'

The prose translation is an amalgam of two fragments. The first sentence
is quoted by Diogenes Laertius, ix. 1: the second by Plutarch, de Pyth.
orac. 6, p. 377.

[1009:1] These rhymes were addressed to a Miss Eliza Nixon, who
supplied S. T. C. with books from a lending library.

With turrets each a Pyramid;&mdash;

NOTES BY PROFESSOR SAINTSBURY

1. I think most ears would take these as anapaestic throughout. But the
introduction of Milton's


Drunk with Idolatry, drunk with wine


as a leit-motiv is of the first interest.

Description of it, l. 4, very curious. I should have thought no one
could have run 'drunk with wine' together as one foot.

2. Admirable! I hardly know better trochaics.

3. Very interesting: but the terminology odd. The dochmius, a
five-syllabled foot, is (in one form&mdash;there are about thirty!) an
antispast &#728; &macr; &macr; &#728; plus a syllable. Catalectic
means (properly) minus a syllable. But the verses as quantified are
really dochmiac, and the only [1020]attempts I have seen. Shall I own I can't
get any English Rhythm on them?

4. More ordinary: but a good arrangement and wonderful for the date.

5. Not nonsense at all: but, metrically, really his usual elegiac.

6. This, if early, is almost priceless. It is not only lovely in
itself, but an obvious attempt to recover the zig-zag outline and varied
cadence of seventeenth century born&mdash;the things that Shelley to some
extent, Beddoes and Darley more, and Tennyson and Browning most were to
master. I subscribe (most humbly) to his suggestions, especially his
second.

7. Very like some late seventeenth-century (Dryden time) motives and a
leetle 'Moorish'.

8. Like 6, and charming.

9. A sort of recurrence to Pindaric&mdash;again pioneer, as the soul of S.
T. C. had to be always.

10 and 11. Ditto.

13. Again, I should say, anapaestic&mdash;but this anapaest and amphibrach
quarrel is &#7940;&#963;&#960;&#959;&#957;&#948;&#959;&#962;.



FOOTNOTES:

[1014:1] 'He attributed in part, his writing so little, to the
extreme care and labour which he applied in elaborating his metres. He
said that when he was intent on a new experiment in metre, the time and
labour he bestowed were inconceivable; that he was quite an epicure in
sound.'&mdash;Wordsworth on Coleridge (as reported by Mr. Justice Coleridge),
Memoirs of W. Wordsworth, 1851, ii. 306.

In a letter to Poole dated March 16, 1801, Coleridge writes: 'I shall
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. immediately publish my Christabel, with the Essays on the
"Preternatural", and on Metre' (Letters of S. T. C., 1895, i. 349).
Something had been done towards the collection of materials for the
first 'Essay', a great deal for the second. In a notebook (No. 22) which
contains dated entries of 1805, 1815, &amp;c., but of which the greater
portion, as the context and various handwritings indicate, belongs to a
much earlier date, there are some forty-eight numbered specimens of
various metres derived from German and Italian sources. To some of these
stanzas or strophes a metrical scheme with original variants is
attached, whilst other schemes are exemplified by metrical experiments
in English, headed 'Nonsense Verses'. Two specimens of these
experiments, headed 'A Sunset' and 'What is Life', are included in the
text of P. W., 1893 (pp. 172, 178), and in that of the present issue,
pp. 393, 394. They are dated 1805 in accordance with the dates of
Coleridge's own comments or afterthoughts, but it is almost certain that
both sets of verses were composed in 1801. The stanza entitled 'An Angel
Visitant' belongs to the same period. Ten other sets of 'Nonsense
Verses' of uncertain but early date are now printed for the first time.

[1014:2] Sumptuous Tyranny floating this way. [MS.] On p. 17 of
Notebook 22 Coleridge writes:&mdash;


&macr; &#728; &#728;, &macr; &#728; &#728;, &macr; &#728;, &macr;
&nbsp;
Drunk with I&mdash;dolatry&mdash;drunk with, Wine.


A noble metre if I can find a metre to precede or follow.


S&#363;mpt&#365;&#335;us D&#257;l&#301;l&#259; fl&#333;at&#301;ng th&#365;s w&#257;y
Drunk with Idolatry, drunk with wine.


Both lines are from Milton's Samson Agonistes.

My pensive Sara! thy soft Cheek reclin'd
Thus on my arm, how soothing sweet it is
Beside our Cot to sit, our Cot o'ergrown
With white-flowr'd Jasmine and the blossom'd myrtle,
(Meet emblems they of Innocence and Love!) 5
And watch the Clouds, that late were rich with light,
Slow-sad'ning round, and mark the star of eve
Serenely brilliant, like thy polish'd Sense,
Shine opposite! What snatches of perfume
The noiseless gale from yonder bean-field wafts! 10
The stilly murmur of the far-off Sea
Tells us of Silence! and behold, my love!
In the half-closed window we will place the Harp,
Which by the desultory Breeze caress'd,
Like some coy maid half willing to be woo'd, 15
Utters such sweet upbraidings as, perforce,
Tempt to repeat the wrong!

And watch the Clouds that, late were rich with light,

Serenely brilliant (such should Wisdom be!)

Plac'd lengthways in the clasping casement, hark!
How by the desultory Breeze caress'd

It pours such sweet Upbraidings, as must needs
Tempt to repeat the wrong. And now it's strings
Boldlier swept, the long sequacious notes
Over delicious Surges sink and rise
In a&euml;ry voyage, Music such as erst 20
Round rosy bowers (so Legendaries tell)
To sleeping Maids came floating witchingly
By wand'ring West winds stoln from Faery land;
Where on some magic Hybla Melodies
Round many a newborn honey-dropping Flower 25
Footless and wild, like Birds of Paradise,
Nor pause nor perch, warbling on untir'd wing.

And thus, my Love! as on the midway Slope
Of yonder Hill I stretch my limbs at noon
And tranquil muse upon Tranquillity. 30
Full many a Thought uncall'd and undetain'd
And many idle flitting Phantasies
Traverse my indolent and passive Mind
As wild, as various, as the random Gales
That swell or flutter on this subject Lute. 35
And what if All of animated Life
Be but as Instruments diversly fram'd
That tremble into thought, while thro' them breathes
One infinite and intellectual Breeze,
And all in diff'rent Heights so aptly hung, 40
That Murmurs indistinct and Bursts sublime,
Shrill Discords and most soothing Melodies,
Harmonious from Creation's vast concent&mdash;
Thus God would be the universal Soul,
[1023]
Mechaniz'd matter as th' organic harps 45
And each one's Tunes be that, which each calls I.

But thy more serious Look a mild Reproof
Darts, O beloved Woman, and thy words
Pious and calm check these unhallow'd Thoughts,
These Shapings of the unregen'rate Soul, 50
Bubbles, that glitter as they rise and break
On vain Philosophy's aye-babbling Spring:
Thou biddest me walk humbly with my God!
Meek Daughter in the family of Christ.
Wisely thou sayest, and holy are thy words! 55
Nor may I unblam'd or speak or think of Him,
Th' Incomprehensible! save when with Awe
I praise him, and with Faith that inly feels,
Who with his saving Mercies heal&egrave;d me,
A sinful and most miserable man 60
Wilder'd and dark, and gave me to possess
Peace and this Cot, and Thee, my best-belov'd!

RECOLLECTION[1023:1]

[Vide ante, pp. 53, 48]



As the tir'd savage, who his drowsy frame
Had bask'd beneath the sun's unclouded flame,
Awakes amid the troubles of the air,
The skiey deluge and white lightning's glare,
Aghast he scours before the tempest's sweep, 5
And sad recalls the sunny hour of sleep!
So tost by storms along life's wild'ring way
Mine eye reverted views that cloudless day,
When by my native brook I wont to rove,
While Hope with kisses nurs'd the infant Love! 10

Dear native brook! like peace so placidly
Smoothing thro' fertile fields thy current meek&mdash;
Dear native brook! where first young Poesy
Star'd wildly eager in her noon-tide dream;
[1024]
Where blameless Pleasures dimpled Quiet's cheek, 15
As water-lilies ripple thy slow stream!
How many various-fated years have past,
What blissful and what anguish'd hours, since last
I skimm'd the smooth thin stone along thy breast
Numb'ring its light leaps! Yet so deep imprest 20
Sink the sweet scenes of childhood, that mine eyes
I never shut amid the sunny blaze,
But strait, with all their tints, thy waters rise,
The crossing plank, and margin's willowy maze,
And bedded sand, that, vein'd with various dyes, 25
Gleam'd thro' thy bright transparence to the gaze&mdash;
Ah! fair tho' faint those forms of memory seem
Like Heaven's bright bow on thy smooth evening stream.

THE DESTINY OF NATIONS

[Draft I]


Auspicious Reverence! Hush all meaner song,
Till we the deep prelusive strain have pour'd
To the Great Father, only Rightful King,
Eternal Father! king omnipotent;
Beneath whose shadowing banners wide-unfurl'd 5
Justice leads forth her tyrant-quelling Hosts.
Such Symphony demands best Instrument.

Seize, then, my Soul, from Freedom's trophied dome
The harp which hanging high between the shields
Of Brutus and Leonidas, oft gives 10
A fitful music, when with breeze-like Touch
Great Spirits passing thrill its wings: the Bard
Listens and knows, thy will to work by Fame.
For what is Freedom, but the unfetter'd use
Of all the powers which God for use had given? 15
But chiefly this, him first to view, him last,
Thro' shapes, and sounds, and all the world of sense,
The change of empires, and the deeds of Man
Translucent, as thro' clouds that veil the Light.
But most, O Man! in thine in wasted Sense 20
And the still growth of Immortality
[1025]
Image of God, and his Eternity.
But some there are who deem themselves most wise
When they within this gross and visible sphere
Chain down the winged thought, scoffing ascent 25
Proud in their meanness&mdash;and themselves they mock
With noisy emptiness of learned phrase
Their subtle fluids, impacts, essences,
Self-working tools, uncaused effects, and all
Those blind Omniscients, those Almighty Slaves, 30
Untenanting Creation of its God!

But properties are God: the Naked Mass
(If Mass there be, at best a guess obscure,)
Acts only by its inactivity.
Here we pause humbly. Others boldlier dream, 35
That as one body is the Aggregate
Of Atoms numberless, each organiz'd,
So by a strange and dim similitude
Infinite myriads of self-conscious minds
Form one all-conscious Spirit, who controlls 40
With absolute ubiquity of Thought
All his component Monads: linked Minds,
Each in his own sphere evermore evolving
Its own entrusted powers&mdash;Howe'er this be,
Whether a dream presumptious, caught from earth 45
And earthly form, or vision veiling Truth,
Yet the Omnific Father of all Worlds
God in God immanent, the eternal Word,
That gives forth, yet remains&mdash;Sun, that at once
Dawns, rises, sets and crowns the Height of Heaven, 50
Great general Agent in all finite souls,
Doth in that action put on finiteness,
For all his Thoughts are acts, and every act
A Being of Substance; God impersonal,
Yet in all worlds impersonate in all, 55
Absolute Infinite, whose dazzling robe
Flows in rich folds, and darts in shooting Hues
Of infinite Finiteness! he rolls each orb
Matures each planet, and Tree, and spread thro' all
Wields all the Universe of Life and Thought, 60
[Yet leaves to all the Creatures meanest, highest,
Angelic Right, self-conscious Agency&mdash;]

Book I, ll. 33-51.


"O France," he cried, "my country"!
When soft as breeze that curls the summer clouds
At close of day, stole on his ear a voice 35
Seraphic.
"Son of Orleans! grieve no more.
His eye not slept, tho' long the All-just endured
[1028]
The woes of France; at length his bar'd right arm
Volleys red thunder. From his veiling clouds
Rushes the storm, Ruin and Fear and Death. 40
Take Son of Orleans the relief of Heaven:
Nor thou the wintry hours of adverse fate
Dream useless: tho' unhous'd thou roam awhile,
The keen and icy wind that shivers thee
Shall brace thine arm, and with stern discipline 45
Firm thy strong heart for fearless enterprise
As who, through many a summer night serene
Had hover'd round the fold with coward wish;
Horrid with brumal ice, the fiercer wolf
From his bleak mountain and his den of snows 50
Leaps terrible and mocks the shepherd's spears."

And oft the tear from his averted eye
He dried; mindful of fertile fields laid waste,
Dispeopled hamlets, the lorn widow's groan,
And the pale orphan's feeble cry for bread. 270
But when he told of those fierce sons of guilt
That o'er this earth which God had fram'd so fair&mdash;
Spread desolation, and its wood-crown'd hills
Make echo to the merciless war-dog's howl;
And how himself from such foul savagery 275
Had scarce escap'd with life, then his stretch'd arm
Seem'd, as it wielded the resistless sword
Of Vengeance: in his eager eye the soul
Was eloquent; warm glow'd his manly cheek;
And beat against his side the indignant heart. 280

From a dark lowering cloud, the womb of tempests, 455
A giant arm burst forth and dropt a sword

Then was there heard a voice, which in mine ear
Shall echo, at that hour of dreadful joy
When the pale foe shall wither in my rage. 460



ll. 484-496[1029:1]


Last evening lone in thought I wandered forth.
Down in the dingle's depth there is a brook 485
That makes its way between the craggy stones,

Whose root uptorn by tempests overhangs
The stream, I sat, and mark'd the deep red clouds
Gather before the wind, while the rude dash 490
Of waters rock'd my senses, and the mists
Rose round: there as I gazed, a form dim-seen
Descended, like the dark and moving clouds
That in the moonbeam change their shadowy shapes.
His voice was on the breeze; he bade me hail 495
The missioned Maid! for lo! the hour was come.

The sons of men shall pitch their tents in peace,
And in the unity of truth preserve
The bond of love. For by the eye of God 80
Hath Virtue sworn, that never one good act
Was work'd in vain.



Book IV, ll. 328-336.


The murmuring tide
Lull'd her, and many a pensive pleasing dream
Rose in sad shadowy trains at Memory's call. 330
She thought of Arc, and of the dingled brook,
[1030]
Whose waves oft leaping on their craggy course
Made dance the low-hung willow's dripping twigs;
And where it spread into a glassy lake,
Of the old oak which on the smooth expanse, 335
Imag'd its hoary mossy-mantled boughs.

THE RIME OF THE ANCYENT MARINERE,[1030:1] IN SEVEN PARTS.


ARGUMENT

How a Ship having passed the Line was driven by Storms to the cold
Country towards the South Pole; and how from thence she made her course
to the Tropical Latitude of the Great Pacific Ocean; and of the strange
things that befell; and in what manner the Ancyent Marinere came back to
his own Country.


I.


It is an ancyent Marinere,
And he stoppeth one of three:
"By thy long grey beard and thy glittering eye
"Now wherefore stoppest me?

"The Bridegroom's doors are open'd wide, 5
"And I am next of kin;
"The Guests are met, the Feast is set,&mdash;
"May'st hear the merry din.

But still he holds the wedding-guest&mdash;
There was a Ship, quoth he&mdash; 10
"Nay, if thou'st got a laughsome tale,
"Marinere! come with me."

[1031]
He holds him with his skinny hand,
Quoth he, there was a Ship&mdash;
"Now get thee hence, thou grey-beard Loon! 15
"Or my Staff shall make thee skip.

He holds him with his glittering eye&mdash;
The wedding guest stood still
And listens like a three year's child;
The Marinere hath his will. 20

The wedding-guest sate on a stone,
He cannot chuse but hear:
And thus spake on that ancyent man,
The bright-eyed Marinere.

The Ship was cheer'd, the Harbour clear'd&mdash; 25
Merrily did we drop
Below the Kirk, below the Hill,
Below the Light-house top.

The Sun came up upon the left,
Out of the Sea came he: 30
And he shone bright, and on the right
Went down into the Sea.

Higher and higher every day,
Till over the mast at noon&mdash;
The wedding-guest here beat his breast, 35
For he heard the loud bassoon.

The Bride hath pac'd into the Hall,
Red as a rose is she;
Nodding their heads before her goes
The merry Minstralsy. 40

The wedding-guest he beat his breast,
Yet he cannot chuse but hear:
And thus spake on that ancyent Man,
The bright-eyed Marinere.

Listen, Stranger! Storm and Wind, 45
A Wind and Tempest strong!
For days and weeks it play'd us freaks&mdash;
Like Chaff we drove along.

Listen, Stranger! Mist and Snow,
And it grew wond'rous cauld: 50
And Ice mast-high came floating by
As green as Emerauld.

[1032]
And thro' the drifts the snowy clifts
Did send a dismal sheen;
Ne shapes of men ne beasts we ken&mdash; 55
The Ice was all between.

The Ice was here, the Ice was there,
The Ice was all around:
It crack'd and growl'd, and roar'd and howl'd&mdash;
Like noises of a swound. 60

At length did cross an Albatross,
Thorough the Fog it came;
And an it were a Christian Soul,
We hail'd it in God's name.

The Marineres gave it biscuit-worms, 65
And round and round it flew:
The Ice did split with a Thunder-fit,
The Helmsman steer'd us thro'.

And a good south wind sprung up behind.
The Albatross did follow; 70
And every day for food or play
Came to the Marinere's hollo!

In mist or cloud on mast or shroud,
It perch'd for vespers nine,
Whiles all the night thro' fog smoke-white, 75
Glimmer'd the white moon-shine.

"God save thee, ancyent Marinere!
"From the fiends that plague thee thus&mdash;
"Why look'st thou so?"&mdash;with my cross bow
I shot the Albatross. 80


II.


The Sun came up upon the right,
Out of the Sea came he;
And broad as a weft upon the left
Went down into the Sea.

And the good south wind still blew behind, 85
But no sweet Bird did follow
Ne any day for food or play
Came to the Marinere's hollo!

[1033]
And I had done an hellish thing
And it would work 'em woe: 90
For all averr'd, I had kill'd the Bird
That made the Breeze to blow.

Ne dim ne red, like God's own head,
The glorious Sun uprist:
Then all averr'd, I had kill'd the Bird 95
That brought the fog and mist.
'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay
That bring the fog and mist.

The breezes blew, the white foam flew,
The furrow follow'd free: 100
We were the first that ever burst
Into that silent Sea.

Down dropt the breeze, the Sails dropt down,
'Twas sad as sad could be
And we did speak only to break 105
The silence of the Sea.

All in a hot and copper sky
The bloody sun at noon,
Right up above the mast did stand,
No bigger than the moon. 110

Day after day, day after day,
We stuck, ne breath ne motion.
As idle as a painted Ship
Upon a painted Ocean.

Water, water, every where, 115
And all the boards did shrink:
Water, water, everywhere,
Ne any drop to drink.

The very deeps did rot: O Christ!
That ever this should be! 120
Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs
Upon the slimy Sea.

About, about, in reel and rout,
The Death-fires danc'd at night;
The water, like a witch's oils, 125
burnt green and blue and white.

[1034]
And some in dreams assured were
Of the Spirit that plagued us so:
Nine fathom deep he had follow'd us
From the Land of Mist and Snow. 130

And every tongue thro' utter drouth
Was wither'd at the root;
We could not speak no more than if
We had been choked with soot.

Ah wel-a-day! what evil looks 135
Had I from old and young;
Instead of the Cross the Albatross
About my neck was hung.


III.


I saw a something in the Sky
No bigger than my fist; 140
At first it seem'd a little speck
And then it seem'd a mist:
It mov'd and mov'd, and took at last
A certain shape, I wist.

A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist! 145
And still it ner'd and ner'd;
And, an it dodg'd a water-sprite,
It plung'd and tack'd and veer'd.

With throat unslack'd, with black lips bak'd
Ne could we laugh, ne wail: 150
Then while thro' drouth all dumb they stood
I bit my arm and suck'd the blood
And cry'd, A sail! a sail!

With throat unslack'd, with black lips bak'd
Agape they hear'd me call: 155
Gramercy! they for joy did grin
And all at once their breath drew in
As they were drinking all.

She doth not tack from side to side&mdash;
Hither to work us weal 160
Withouten wind, withouten tide
She steddies with upright keel.

[1035]
The western wave was all a flame,
The day was well nigh done!
Almost upon the western wave 165
Rested the broad bright Sun;
When that strange shape drove suddenly
Betwixt us and the Sun.

And strait the Sun was fleck'd with bars
(Heaven's mother send us grace) 170
As if thro' a dungeon grate he peer'd
With broad and burning face.

Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)
How fast she neres and neres!
Are those her Sails that glance in the Sun 175
Like restless gossameres?

Are those her naked ribs, which fleck'd
The sun that did behind them peer?
And are those two all, all the crew,
That woman and her fleshless Pheere? 180

His bones were black with many a crack,
All black and bare, I ween;
Jet-black and bare, save where with rust
Of mouldy damps and charnel crust
They're patch'd with purple and green. 185

Her lips are red, her looks are free,
Her locks are yellow as gold:
Her skin is as white as leprosy,
And she is far liker Death than he;
Her flesh makes the still air cold. 190

The naked Hulk alongside came
And the Twain were playing dice;
"The Game is done! I've won, I've won!"
Quoth she, and whistled thrice.

A gust of wind sterte up behind 195
And whistled thro' his bones;
Thro' the holes of his eyes and the hole of his mouth
Half-whistles and half-groans.

[1036]
With never a whisper in the Sea
Off darts the Spectre-ship; 200
While clombe above the Eastern bar
The horned Moon, with one bright Star
Almost atween the tips.

One after one by the horned Moon
(Listen, O Stranger! to me) 205
Each turn'd his face with a ghastly pang
And curs'd me with his ee.

Four times fifty living men,
With never a sigh or groan,
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump 210
They dropp'd down one by one.

Their souls did from their bodies fly,&mdash;
They fled to bliss or woe;
And every soul it pass'd me by,
Like the whiz of my Cross-bow. 215


IV.

"I fear thee, ancyent Marinere!
"I fear thy skinny hand;
"And thou art long, and lank, and brown,
"As is the ribb'd Sea-sand.

"I fear thee and thy glittering eye 220
"And thy skinny hand so brown&mdash;
Fear not, fear not, thou wedding guest!
This body dropt not down.

Alone, alone, all all alone
Alone on the wide wide Sea; 225
And Christ would take no pity on
My soul in agony.

The many men so beautiful,
And they all dead did lie!
And a million million slimy things 230
Liv'd on&mdash;and so did I.

I look'd upon the rotting Sea,
And drew my eyes away;
I look'd upon the eldritch deck,
And there the dead men lay. 235

[1037]
I look'd to Heav'n, and try'd to pray;
But or ever a prayer had gusht,
A wicked whisper came and made
My heart as dry as dust.

I clos'd my lids and kept them close, 240
Till the balls like pulses beat;
For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky
Lay like a load on my weary eye,
And the dead were at my feet.

The cold sweat melted from their limbs, 245
Ne rot, ne reek did they;
The look with which they look'd on me,
Had never pass'd away.

An orphan's curse would drag to Hell
A spirit from on high: 250
But O! more horrible than that
Is the curse in a dead man's eye!
Seven days, seven nights I saw that curse,
And yet I could not die.

The moving Moon went up the sky, 255
And no where did abide:
Softly she was going up
And a star or two beside&mdash;

Her beams bemock'd the sultry main
Like morning frosts yspread; 260
But where the ship's huge shadow lay,
The charmed water burnt alway
A still and awful red.

Beyond the shadow of the ship
I watch'd the water-snakes: 265
They mov'd in tracks of shining white;
And when they rear'd, the elfish light
Fell off in hoary flakes.

Within the shadow of the ship
I watch'd their rich attire: 270
Blue, glossy green, and velvet black
They coil'd and swam; and every track
Was a flash of golden fire.

[1038]
O happy living things! no tongue
Their beauty might declare: 275
A spring of love gusht from my heart,
And I bless'd them unaware!
Sure my kind saint took pity on me,
And I bless'd them unaware.

The self-same moment I could pray; 280
And from my neck so free
The Albatross fell off, and sank
Like lead into the sea.


V.


O sleep, it is a gentle thing,
Belov'd from pole to pole! 285
To Mary-queen the praise be yeven
She sent the gentle sleep from heaven
That slid into my soul.

The silly buckets on the deck
That had so long remain'd, 290
I dreamt that they were fill'd with dew
And when I awoke it rain'd.

My lips were wet, my throat was cold,
My garments all were dank;
Sure I had drunken in my dreams 295
And still my body drank.

I mov'd and could not feel my limbs,
I was so light, almost
I thought that I had died in sleep,
And was a blessed Ghost. 300

The roaring wind! it roar'd far off,
It did not come anear;
But with its sound it shook the sails
That were so thin and sere.

The upper air bursts into life, 305
And a hundred fire-flags sheen
To and fro they are hurried about;
And to and fro, and in and out
The stars dance on between.

[1039]
The coming wind doth roar more loud; 310
The sails do sigh, like sedge:
The rain pours down from one black cloud
And the Moon is at its edge.

Hark! hark! the thick black cloud is cleft,
And the Moon is at its side: 315
Like waters shot from some high crag,
The lightning falls with never a jag
A river steep and wide.

The strong wind reach'd the ship: it roar'd
And dropp'd down, like a stone! 320
Beneath the lightning and the moon
The dead men gave a groan.

They groan'd, they stirr'd, they all uprose,
Ne spake, ne mov'd their eyes:
It had been strange, even in a dream 325
To have seen those dead men rise.

The helmsman steer'd, the ship mov'd on;
Yet never a breeze up-blew;
The Marineres all 'gan work the ropes,
Where they were wont to do: 330
They rais'd their limbs like lifeless tools&mdash;
We were a ghastly crew.

The body of my brother's son
Stood by me knee to knee:
The body and I pull'd at one rope, 335
But he said nought to me&mdash;
And I quak'd to think of my own voice
How frightful it would be!

The day-light dawn'd&mdash;they dropp'd their arms,
And cluster'd round the mast: 340
Sweet sounds rose slowly thro' their mouths
And from their bodies pass'd.

Around, around, flew each sweet sound,
Then darted to the sun:
Slowly the sounds came back again 345
Now mix'd, now one by one.

[1040]
Sometimes a dropping from the sky
I heard the Lavrock sing;
Sometimes all little birds that are
How they seem'd to fill the sea and air 350
With their sweet jargoning.

And now 'twas like all instruments,
Now like a lonely flute;
And now it is an angel's song
That makes the heavens be mute. 355

It ceas'd: yet still the sails made on
A pleasant noise till noon,
A noise like of a hidden brook
In the leafy month of June,
That to the sleeping woods all night 360
Singeth a quiet tune.

Listen, O listen, thou Wedding-guest!
"Marinere! thou hast thy will:
"For that, which comes out of thine eye, doth make
"My body and soul to be still." 365

Never sadder tale was told
To a man of woman born:
Sadder and wiser thou wedding-guest!
Thou'lt rise to-morrow morn.

Never sadder tale was heard 370
By a man of woman born:
The Marineres all return'd to work
As silent as beforne.

The Marineres all 'gan pull the ropes,
But look at me they n'old: 375
Thought I, I am as thin as air&mdash;
They cannot me behold.

Till noon we silently sail'd on
Yet never a breeze did breathe:
Slowly and smoothly went the ship 380
Mov'd onward from beneath.

Under the keel nine fathom deep
From the land of mist and snow
The spirit slid: and it was He
That made the Ship to go. 385
The sails at noon left off their tune
And the Ship stood still also.

[1041]
The sun right up above the mast
Had fix'd her to the ocean:
But in a minute she 'gan stir 390
With a short uneasy motion&mdash;
Backwards and forwards half her length
With a short uneasy motion.

Then, like a pawing horse let go,
She made a sudden bound: 395
It flung the blood into my head,
And I fell into a swound.

How long in that same fit I lay,
I have not to declare;
But ere my living life return'd, 400
I heard and in my soul discern'd
Two voices in the air,

"Is it he?" quoth one, "Is this the man?
"By him who died on cross,
"With his cruel bow he lay'd full low 405
"The harmless Albatross.

"The spirit who 'bideth by himself
"In the land of mist and snow,
"He lov'd the bird that lov'd the man
"Who shot him with his bow. 410

The other was a softer voice,
As soft as honey-dew:
Quoth he the man hath penance done,
And penance more will do.


VI.

First Voice.


"But tell me, tell me! speak again, 415
"Thy soft response renewing&mdash;
"What makes that ship drive on so fast?
"What is the Ocean doing?


Second Voice.


"Still as a Slave before his Lord,
"The Ocean hath no blast: 420
"His great bright eye most silently
"Up to the moon is cast&mdash;

[1042]
"If he may know which way to go,
"For she guides him smooth or grim.
"See, brother, see! how graciously 425
"She looketh down on him.


First Voice.


"But why drives on that ship so fast
"Withouten wave or wind?


Second Voice.


"The air is cut away before,
"And closes from behind. 430

"Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high,
"Or we shall be belated:
"For slow and slow that ship will go,
"When the Marinere's trance is abated."

I woke, and we were sailing on 435
As in a gentle weather:
'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high;
The dead men stood together.

All stood together on the deck,
For a charnel-dungeon fitter: 440
All fix'd on me their stony eyes
That in the moon did glitter.

The pang, the curse, with which they died,
Had never pass'd away:
I could not draw my een from theirs 445
Ne turn them up to pray.

And in its time the spell was snapt,
And I could move my een:
I look'd far-forth, but little saw
Of what might else be seen. 450

Like one, that on a lonely road
Doth walk in fear and dread,
And having once turn'd round, walks on
And turns no more his head:
Because he knows, a frightful fiend 455
Doth close behind him tread.

But soon there breath'd a wind on me,
Ne sound ne motion made:
Its path was not upon the sea
In ripple or in shade. 460

[1043]
It rais'd my hair, it fann'd my cheek,
Like a meadow-gale of spring&mdash;
It mingled strangely with my fears,
Yet it felt like a welcoming.

Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship, 465
Yet she sail'd softly too:
Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze&mdash;
On me alone it blew.

O dream of joy! is this indeed
The light-house top I see? 470
Is this the Hill? Is this the Kirk?
Is this mine own countr&eacute;e?

We drifted o'er the Harbour-bar,
And I with sobs did pray&mdash;
"O let me be awake, my God! 475
"Or let me sleep alway!"

The harbour-bay was clear as glass,
So smoothly it was strewn!
And on the bay the moon light lay,
And the shadow of the moon. 480

The moonlight bay was white all o'er,
Till rising from the same,
Full many shapes, that shadows were,
Like as of torches came.

A little distance from the prow 485
Those dark-red shadows were;
But soon I saw that my own flesh
Was red as in a glare.

I turn'd my head in fear and dread,
And by the holy rood, 490
The bodies had advanc'd, and now
Before the mast they stood.

They lifted up their stiff right arms,
They held them strait and tight;
And each right-arm burnt like a torch, 495
A torch that's borne upright.
Their stony eye-balls glitter'd on
In the red and smoky light.

[1044]
I pray'd and turn'd my head away
Forth looking as before. 500
There was no breeze upon the bay,
No wave against the shore.

The rock shone bright, the kirk no less
That stands above the rock:
The moonlight steep'd in silentness 505
The steady weathercock.

And the bay was white with silent light,
Till rising from the same
Full many shapes, that shadows were,
In crimson colours came. 510

A little distance from the prow
Those crimson shadows were:
I turn'd my eyes upon the deck&mdash;
O Christ! what saw I there?

Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat; 515
And by the Holy rood
A man all light, a seraph-man,
On every corse there stood.

This seraph-band, each wav'd his hand:
It was a heavenly sight: 520
They stood as signals to the land,
Each one a lovely light:

This seraph-band, each wav'd his hand,
No voice did they impart&mdash;
No voice; but O! the silence sank, 525
Like music on my heart.

Eftsones I heard the dash of oars,
I heard the pilot's cheer:
My head was turn'd perforce away
And I saw a boat appear. 530

Then vanish'd all the lovely lights;
The bodies rose anew:
With silent pace, each to his place,
Came back the ghastly crew.
The wind, that shade nor motion made, 535
On me alone it blew.

[1045]
The pilot, and the pilot's boy
I heard them coming fast:
Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy,
The dead men could not blast. 540

I saw a third&mdash;I heard his voice:
It is the Hermit good!
He singeth loud his godly hymns
That he makes in the wood.
He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away 545
The Albatross's blood.


VII.


This Hermit good lives in that wood
Which slopes down to the Sea.
How loudly his sweet voice he rears!
He loves to talk with Marineres 550
That come from a far Contr&eacute;e.

He kneels at morn and noon and eve&mdash;
He hath a cushion plump:
It is the moss, that wholly hides
The rotted old Oak-stump. 555

The Skiff-boat ne'rd: I heard them talk,
"Why, this is strange, I trow!
"Where are those lights so many and fair
"That signal made but now?

"Strange, by my faith! the Hermit said&mdash; 560
"And they answer'd not our cheer.
"The planks look warp'd, and see those sails
"How thin they are and sere!
"I never saw aught like to them
"Unless perchance it were 565

"The skeletons of leaves that lag
"My forest-brook along:
"When the Ivy-tod is heavy with snow,
"And the Owlet whoops to the wolf below
"That eats the she-wolfs young. 570

"Dear Lord! it has a fiendish look&mdash;
(The Pilot made reply)
"I am afear'd&mdash;"Push on, push on!
"Said the Hermit cheerily.

[1046]
The Boat came closer to the Ship, 575
But I ne spake ne stirr'd!
The Boat came close beneath the Ship,
And strait a sound was heard!

Under the water it rumbled on,
Still louder and more dread: 580
It reach'd the Ship, it split the bay;
The Ship went down like lead.

Stunn'd by that loud and dreadful sound,
Which sky and ocean smote:
Like one that had been seven days drown'd 585
My body lay afloat:
But, swift as dreams, myself I found
Within the Pilot's boat.

Upon the whirl, where sank the Ship,
The boat spun round and round: 590
And all was still, save that the hill
Was telling of the sound.

I mov'd my lips: the Pilot shriek'd
And fell down in a fit.
The Holy Hermit rais'd his eyes 595
And pray'd where he did sit.

I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,
Who now doth crazy go,
Laugh'd loud and long, and all the while
His eyes went to and fro, 600
"Ha! ha!" quoth he&mdash;"full plain I see,
"The devil knows how to row."

And now all in mine own Countr&eacute;e
I stood on the firm land!
The Hermit stepp'd forth from the boat, 605
And scarcely he could stand.

"O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy Man!
The Hermit cross'd his brow&mdash;
"Say quick," quoth he, "I bid thee say
"What manner man art thou?" 610

Forthwith this frame of mine was wrench'd
With a woeful agony,
Which forc'd me to begin my tale
And then it left me free.

[1047]
Since then at an uncertain hour, 615
Now oftimes and now fewer,
That anguish comes and makes me tell
My ghastly aventure.

I pass, like night, from land to land;
I have strange power of speech; 620
The moment that his face I see
I know the man that must hear me;
To him my tale I teach.

What loud uproar bursts from that door!
The Wedding-guests are there; 625
But in the Garden-bower the Bride
And Bride-maids singing are:
And hark the little Vesper-bell
Which biddeth me to prayer.

O Wedding-guest! this soul hath been 630
Alone on a wide wide sea:
So lonely 'twas, that God himself
Scarce seemed there to be.

O sweeter than the Marriage-feast,
'Tis sweeter far to me 635
To walk together to the Kirk
With a goodly company.

To walk together to the Kirk
And all together pray,
While each to his great Father bends, 640
Old men, and babes, and loving friends,
And Youths, and Maidens gay.

Farewell, farewell! but this I tell
To thee, thou wedding-guest!
He prayeth well who loveth well, 645
Both man and bird and beast.

He prayeth best who loveth best,
All things both great and small:
For the dear God, who loveth us,
He made and loveth all. 650

The Marinere, whose eye is bright,
Whose beard with age is hoar,
Is gone; and now the wedding-guest
Turn'd from the bridegroom's door.

[1048]
He went, like one that hath been stunn'd 655
And is of sense forlorn:
A sadder and a wiser man
He rose the morrow morn.

THE RAVEN

[As printed in the Morning Post, March 10, 1798.]

[Vide ante, p. 169.]


Under the arms of a goodly oak-tree,
There was of Swine a large company.
They were making a rude repast,
Grunting as they crunch'd the mast.
Then they trotted away: for the wind blew high&mdash; 5
One acorn they left, ne more mote you spy.
Next came a Raven, who lik'd not such folly;
He belong'd, I believe, to the witch Melancholy!
Blacker was he than the blackest jet;
Flew low in the rain; his feathers were wet. 10
He pick'd up the acorn and buried it strait,
By the side of a river both deep and great.
Where then did the Raven go?
He went high and low&mdash;
O'er hill, o'er dale did the black Raven go! 15
Many Autumns, many Springs;
Travell'd he with wand'ring wings;
Many Summers, many Winters&mdash;
I can't tell half his adventures.
At length he return'd, and with him a she; 20
And the acorn was grown a large oak-tree.
They built them a nest in the topmost bough,
And young ones they had, and were jolly enow.
But soon came a Woodman in leathern guise:
His brow like a pent-house hung over his eyes. 25
He'd an axe in his hand, and he nothing spoke,
But with many a hem! and a sturdy stroke,
At last he brought down the poor Raven's own oak.
His young ones were kill'd, for they could not depart,
And his wife she did die of a broken heart! 30
[1049]The branches from off it the Woodman did sever!
And they floated it down on the course of the River:
They saw'd it to planks, and it's rind they did strip,
And with this tree and others they built up a ship.
The ship, it was launch'd; but in sight of the land, 35
A tempest arose which no ship could withstand.
It bulg'd on a rock, and the waves rush'd in fast&mdash;
The auld Raven flew round and round, and caw'd to the blast.
He heard the sea-shriek of their perishing souls&mdash;
They be sunk! O'er the top-mast the mad water rolls. 40
The Raven was glad that such fate they did meet,
They had taken his all, and Revenge was Sweet!

[Add. MSS. 27,902.]


High o'er the silver rocks I roved
To forget the form I loved
In hopes fond fancy would be kind
And steal my Mary from my mind
T'was twilight and the lunar beam 5
Sailed slowly o'er Tamaha's stream
As down its sides the water strayed
Bright on a rock the moonbeam playe[d]
It shone, half-sheltered from the view
By pendent boughs of tressy yew 10
True, true to love but false to rest,
So fancy whispered to my breast,
So shines her forehead smooth and fair
Gleaming through her sable hair
I turned to heaven&mdash;but viewed on high 15
The languid lustre of her eye
[1050]
The moons mild radiant edge I saw
Peeping a black-arched cloud below
Nor yet its faint and paly beam
Could tinge its skirt with yellow gleam 20
I saw the white waves o'er and o'er
Break against a curved shore
Now disappearing from the sight
Now twinkling regular and white
Her mouth, her smiling mouth can shew 25
As white and regular a row
Haste Haste, some God indulgent prove
And bear me, bear me to my love
Then might&mdash;for yet the sultry hour
Glows from the sun's oppressive power 30
Then might her bosom soft and white
Heave upon my swimming sight
As yon two swans together heave
Upon the gently-swelling wave
Haste&mdash;haste some God indulgent prove 35
And bear&mdash;oh bear me to my love.

Image of Lewti! leave my mind
If Lewti never will be kind! 50

Away the little Cloud, away.
Away it goes&mdash;away so soon

Alas! it has no power to stay:
It's hues are dim, it's hues are grey
Away it passes from the Moon. 55

When, Lewti! on my couch I lie
A dying Man for Love of thee!
Thou living Image
Image of Lewti in my mind, 60
Methinks thou lookest not kin unkind!

H

INTRODUCTION TO THE TALE OF THE DARK LADIE[1052:1]

[Vide ante, p. 330.]


To the Editor of The Morning Post.

Sir,

The following Poem is the Introduction to a somewhat longer one, for
which I shall solicit insertion on your next open day. The use of the
Old Ballad word, Ladie, for Lady, is the only piece of obsoleteness in
it; and as it is professedly a tale of ancient times, I trust, that 'the
affectionate lovers of venerable antiquity' (as Camden says) will grant
me their pardon, and perhaps may be induced to admit a force and
propriety in it. A heavier objection may be adduced against the Author,
that in these times of fear and expectation, when novelties explode
around us in all directions, he should presume [1053]to offer to the public a
silly tale of old fashioned love; and, five years ago, I own, I should
have allowed and felt the force of this objection. But, alas! explosion
has succeeded explosion so rapidly, that novelty itself ceases to appear
new; and it is possible that now, even a simple story, wholly unspired
[? inspired] with politics or personality, may find some attention amid
the hubbub of Revolutions, as to those who have resided a long time by
the falls of Niagara, the lowest whispering becomes distinctly audible.

S. T. Coleridge.


1


O leave the Lily on its stem;
O leave the Rose upon the spray;
O leave the Elder-bloom, fair Maids!
And listen to my lay.


2


A Cypress and a Myrtle bough, 5
This morn around my harp you twin'd,
Because it fashion'd mournfully
Its murmurs in the wind.


3


And now a Tale of Love and Woe,
A woeful Tale of Love I sing: 10
Hark, gentle Maidens, hark! it sighs
And trembles on the string.


4


But most, my own dear Genevieve!
It sighs and trembles most for thee!
O come and hear the cruel wrongs 15
Befel the dark Ladie!


5


Few sorrows hath she of her own,
My hope, my joy, my Genevieve!
She loves me best whene'er I sing
The songs that make her grieve. 20


[1054]

6


All thoughts, all passions, all delights,
Whatever stirs this mortal frame,
All are but ministers of Love,
And feed his sacred flame.


7


O ever in my waking dreams, 25
I dwell upon that happy hour,
When midway on the Mount I sate
Beside the ruin'd Tow'r.


8


The moonshine, stealing o'er the scene,
Had blended with the lights of eve, 30
And she was there, my hope! my joy!
My own dear Genevieve!


9


She lean'd against the armed Man
The statue of the armed Knight&mdash;
[1055]
She stood and listen'd to my harp, 35
Amid the ling'ring light.


10


I play'd a sad and doleful air,
I sang an old and moving story,
An old rude song, that fitted well
The ruin wild and hoary. 40


11


She listen'd with a flitting blush,
With downcast eyes and modest grace:
For well she knew, I could not choose
But gaze upon her face.


12


I told her of the Knight that wore 45
Upon his shield a burning brand.
And how for ten long years he woo'd
The Ladie of the Land:


13


I told her, how he pin'd, and ah!
The deep, the low, the pleading tone, 50
With which I sang another's love,
Interpreted my own!


14


She listen'd with a flitting blush,
With downcast eyes and modest grace.
And she forgave me, that I gaz'd 55
Too fondly on her face!


[1056]

15


But when I told the cruel scorn,
That craz'd this bold and lovely Knight;
And how he roam'd the mountain woods,
Nor rested day or night; 60


16


And how he cross'd the Woodman's paths,
Thro' briars and swampy mosses beat;
How boughs rebounding scourg'd his limbs,
And low stubs gor'd his feet.


17


How sometimes from the savage den, 65
And sometimes from the darksome shade,
And sometimes starting up at once,
In green and sunny glade;


18


There came and look'd him in the face
An Angel beautiful and bright, 70
And how he knew it was a Fiend,
This mis'rable Knight!


19


And how, unknowing what he did,
He leapt amid a lawless band,
And sav'd from outrage worse than death 75
The Ladie of the Land.


20


And how she wept, and clasp'd his knees,
And how she tended him in vain,
And meekly strove to expiate
The scorn that craz'd his brain; 80


[1057]

21


And how she nurs'd him in a cave;
And how his madness went away,
When on the yellow forest leaves
A dying man he lay;


22


His dying words&mdash;but when I reach'd 85
That tenderest strain of all the ditty,
My fault'ring voice and pausing harp
Disturb'd her soul with pity.


23


All impulses of soul and sense
Had thrill'd my guiltless Genevieve&mdash; 90
The music and the doleful tale,
The rich and balmy eve;


24


And hopes and fears that kindle hope,
An undistinguishable throng;
And gentle wishes long subdu'd, 95
Subdu'd and cherish'd long.


25


She wept with pity and delight&mdash;
She blush'd with love and maiden shame,
And like the murmurs of a dream,
I heard her breathe my name. 100


[1058]

26


I saw her bosom heave and swell,
Heave and swell with inward sighs&mdash;
I could not choose but love to see
Her gentle bosom rise.


27


Her wet cheek glow'd; she stept aside, 105
As conscious of my look she stept;
Then suddenly, with tim'rous eye,
She flew to me, and wept;


28


She half-inclos'd me with her arms&mdash;
She press'd me with a meek embrace; 110
And, bending back her head, look'd up,
And gaz'd upon my face.


29

'Twas partly love, and partly fear,
And partly 'twas a bashful art,
That I might rather feel than see, 115
The swelling of her heart.


[1059]

30


I calm'd her fears, and she was calm,
And told her love with virgin pride;
And so I won my Genevieve,
My bright and beaut'ous bride. 120


31


And now once more a tale of woe,
A woeful tale of love, I sing:
For thee, my Genevieve! it sighs,
And trembles on the string.


32


When last I sang the cruel scorn 125
That craz'd this bold and lonely Knight,
And how he roam'd the mountain woods,
Nor rested day or night;


33


I promis'd thee a sister tale
Of Man's perfidious cruelty: 130
Come, then, and hear what cruel wrong
Befel the Dark Ladie.

FOOTNOTES:

[1060:1] Now first published from an MS. in the British Museum
(Add. MSS. 34,225). The Triumph of Loyalty, 'a sort of dramatic
romance' (see Letter to Poole, December 5, 1800; Letters of S. T.
C., 1895, i. 343), was begun and left unfinished in the late autumn of
1800. An excerpt (ll. 277-358) was revised and published as 'A Night
Scene. A Dramatic Fragment,' in Sibylline Leaves (1817), vide ante,
pp. 421-3. The revision of the excerpt (ll. 263-349) with respect to the
order and arrangement of its component parts is indicated by asterisks,
which appear to be contemporary with the MS. I have, therefore, in
printing the MS., followed the revised and not the original order of
these lines. Again, in the hitherto unpublished portion of the MS. (ll.
1-263) I have omitted rough drafts of passages which were rewritten,
either on the same page or on the reverse of the leaf.

[1060:2] The words enclosed in brackets are not to be found in
the text. They were either invented or adapted by Coleridge ad hoc.
The text of the passage as a whole has been reconstructed by modern
editors.

THE TRIUMPH OF LOYALTY

ACT I

Scene I. A cultivated Plain, skirted on the Left by a Wood. The
Pyrenees are visible in the distance. Small knots of Soldiers all in the
military Dress of the middle Ages are seen passing across the Stage.
Then

Enter Earl Henry and Sandoval, both armed.


Sandoval. A delightful plain this, and doubly pleasant
after so long and wearisome a descent from the Pyranees
[sic]. Did you not observe how our poor over wearied horses
mended their pace as soon as they reached it?

Earl Henry. I must entreat your forgiveness, gallant 5
Castilian! I ought ere this to have bade you welcome to my
native Navarre.

Sandoval. Cheerily, General! Navarre has indeed but ill
repaid your services, in thus recalling you from the head of
an army which you yourself had collected and disciplined. 10
But the wrongs and insults which you have suffered&mdash;&mdash;

Earl Henry. Deserve my thanks, Friend! In the sunshine
of Court-favor I could only believe that I loved my Queen and
my Country: now I know it. But why name I my Country or
my Sovereign? I owe all my Wrongs to the private enmity of 15
the Chancellor.

Sandoval. Heaven be praised, you have atchieved [sic]
a delicious revenge upon him!&mdash;that the same Courier who
brought the orders for your recall carried back with him the
first tidings of your Victory&mdash;it was exquisite good fortune! 20

Earl Henry. Sandoval! my gallant Friend! Let me not
deceive you. To you I have vowed an undisguised openness.
The gloom which overcast me, was occasioned by causes of less
public import.

Sandoval. Connected, I presume, with that Mansion, the 25
spacious pleasure grounds of which we noticed as we were
descending from the mountain. Lawn and Grove, River and
Hillock&mdash;it looked within these high walls, like a World of
itself.

[1063]
Earl Henry. This Wood scarcely conceals these high walls 30
from us. Alas! I know the place too well.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Nay, why too
well?&mdash;But wherefore spake you, Sandoval, of this Mansion?
What know you?

Sandoval. Nothing. Therefore I spake of it. On our descent
from the mountain I pointed it out to you and asked to whom 35
it belonged&mdash;you became suddenly absent, and answered me
only by looks of Disturbance and Anxiety.

Earl Henry. That Mansion once belonged to Manric [sic],
Lord of Valdez.

Sandoval. Alas, poor Man! the same, who had dangerous 40
claims to the Throne of Navarre.

Earl Henry. Claims?&mdash;Say rather, pretensions&mdash;plausible
only to the unreasoning Multitude.

Sandoval. Pretensions then (with bitterness).

Earl Henry. Bad as these were, the means he employed to 45
give effect to them were still worse. He trafficked with France
against the independence of his Country. He was a traitor,
my Friend! and died a traitor's death. His two sons suffered
with him, and many, (I fear, too many) of his adherents.

Sandoval. Earl Henry! (a pause) If the sentence were just, 50
why was not the execution of it public.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is reported, that
they were&mdash;but no! I will not believe it&mdash;the honest soul of
my friend would not justify so foul a deed.

Earl Henry. Speak plainly&mdash;what is reported?

Sandoval. That they were all assassinated by order of the 55
new Queen.

Earl Henry. Accursed be the hearts that framed and
the tongues that scattered the Calumny!&mdash;The Queen was
scarcely seated on her throne; the Chancellor, who had been
her Guardian, exerted a pernicious influence over her 60
judgement&mdash;she was taught to fear dangerous commotions in the
Capital, she was intreated to prevent the bloodshed of the
deluded citizens, and thus overawed she reluctantly consented
to permit the reinforcement of an obsolete law, and&mdash;&mdash;

Sandoval. They were not assassinated then?&mdash;&mdash; 65

Earl Henry. Why these bitter tones to me, Sandoval? Can
a law assassinate? Don Manrique [sic] and his accomplices
drank the sleepy poison adjudged by that law in the State
Prison at Pampilona. At that time I was with the army on
the frontiers of France. 70

Sandoval. Had you been in the Capital&mdash;&mdash;

Earl Henry. I would have pledged my life on the safety of
a public Trial and a public Punishment.

[1064]
Sandoval. Poisoned! The Father and his Sons!&mdash;And this,
Earl Henry, was the first act of that Queen, whom you idolize! 75

Earl Henry. No, Sandoval, No! This was not her act. She
roused herself from the stupor of alarm, she suspended in
opposition to the advice of her council, all proceedings against
the inferior partisans of the Conspiracy; she facilitated the
escape of Don Manrique's brother, and to Donna Oropeza, his 80
daughter and only surviving child, she restored all her father's
possessions, nay became herself her Protectress and Friend.
These were the acts, these the first acts of my royal Mistress.

Sandoval. And how did Donna Oropeza receive these favors?

Earl Henry. Why ask you that? Did they not fall on her, 85
like heavenly dews?

Sandoval. And will they not rise again, like an earthly mist?
What is Gratitude opposed to Ambition, filial revenge, and
Woman's rivalry&mdash;what is it but a cruel Curb in the mouth of
a fiery Horse, maddening the fierce animal whom it cannot 90
restrain? Forgive me, Earl Henry! I meant not to move
you so deeply.

Earl Henry. Sandoval, you have uttered that in a waking
hour which having once dreamt, I feared the return of sleep
lest I should dream it over again. My Friend (his Voice 95
trembling) I woo'd the daughter of Don Manrique, but we are
interrupted.

Sandoval. It is Fernandez.

Earl Henry (struggling with his emotions). A true-hearted old
fellow&mdash;&mdash; 100

Sandoval. As splenetic as he is brave.

Enter Fernandez.

Earl Henry. Well, my ancient! how did you like our tour
through the mountains. (Earl Henry sits down on the seat by
the woodside.)



Fernandez. But little, General! and my faithful charger 105
Liked it still less.
The field of battle in the level plain
By Fontarabia was more to our taste.

Earl Henry. Where is my brother, Don Curio! Have you
Seen him of late?


[1065]


Fernandez. Scarcely, dear General! 110
For by my troth I have been laughing at him
Even till the merry tears so filled my eyes
That I lost sight of him.

Sandoval. But wherefore, Captain.

Fernandez. He hath been studying speeches with fierce gestures;
Speeches brimfull of wrath and indignation, 115
The which he hopes to vent in open council:
And, in the heat and fury of this fancy
He grasp'd your groom of the Chamber by the throat
Who squeaking piteously, Ey! quoth your brother,
I cry you Mercy, Fool! Hadst been indeed 120
The Chancellor, I should have strangled thee.

Sandoval. Ha, ha! poor Barnard!

Fernandez. What you know my Gentleman,
My Groom of the Chamber, my Sieur Barnard, hey?

Sandoval. I know him for a barren-pated coxcomb.

Fernandez. But very weedy, Sir! in worthless phrases, 125
A sedulous eschewer of the popular
And the colloquial&mdash;one who seeketh dignity
I' th' paths of circumlocution! It would have
Surpris'd you tho', to hear how nat'rally
He squeak'd when Curio had him by the throat. 130

Sandoval. I know him too for an habitual scorner
Of Truth.

Fernandez. And one that lies more dully than
Old Women dream, without pretence of fancy,
Humour or mirth, a most disinterested,
Gratuitous Liar.

Earl Henry. Ho! enough, enough! 135
Spare him, I pray you, were't but from respect
To the presence of his Lord.

Sandoval. I stand reprov'd.

Fernandez. I too, but that I know our noble General
Maintains him near his person, only that
If he should ever go in jeopardy 140
Of being damn'd (as he's now persecuted)
For his virtue and fair sense, he may be sav'd
By the supererogation of this Fellow's
Folly and Worthlessness.&mdash;&mdash;


[1066]


Earl Henry. Hold, hold, good Ancient!
Do you not know that this Barnard saved my life? 145
Well, but my brother&mdash;&mdash;

Fernandez. He will soon be here.
I swear by this, my sword, dear General.
I swear he has a Hero's soul&mdash;I only
Wish I could communicate to him
My gift of governing the spleen.&mdash;Then he 150
Has had his colors, the drums too of the Regiment
All put in cases&mdash;O, that stirs the Soldiery.

Earl Henry. Impetuous Boy!

Fernandez. Nay, Fear not for them, General.
The Chancellor, no doubt, will take good care
To let their blood grow cool on garrison duty. 155

Sandoval. Earl Henry! Frown not thus upon Fernandez;
'Tis said, and all the Soldiery believe it,
That the five Regiments who return with you
Will be dispers'd in garrisons and castles,
And other Jails of honourable name. 160
So great a crime it is to have been present
In duty and devotion to a Hero!

Fernandez. What now? What now? The politic Chancellor is
The Soldier's friend, and rather than not give
Snug pensions to brave Men, he'll overlook 165
All small disqualifying circumstances
Of youth and health, keen eye and muscular limb,
He'll count our scars, and set them down for maims.
And gain us thus all privileges and profits
Of Invalids and superannuate veterans. 170

Earl Henry. 'Tis but an idle rumour&mdash;See! they come.


Enter Barnard and a number of Soldiers, their Colours wound up, and
the Drums in Cases, and after them Don Curio. All pay the military
Honors to the General. During this time Fernandez has hurried up in
front of the Stage.

Enter Don Curio.


Don Curio (advancing to Earl Henry). Has Barnard told you?
Insult on insult! by mine honor, Brother!
(Barnard goes beside Curio.) And by our Father's soul they mean to saint you,
Having first prov'd your Patience more than mortal. 175


[1067]


Earl Henry. Take heed, Don Curio! lest with greater right
They scoff my Brother for a choleric boy.
What insult then?

Don Curio. Our Friend, the Chancellor,
Welcomes you home, and shares the common joy
In the most happy tidings of your Victory: 180
But as to your demand of instant audience
From the Queen's Royal Person,&mdash;'tis rejected!

Sandoval. Rejected?

Barnard (making a deep obeisance). May it please the Earl!

Earl Henry. Speak, Barnard.

Barnard. The noble Youth, your very valiant brother,
And wise as valiant (bowing to Don Curio who puffs at him) rightly doth insinuate 185
Fortune deals nothing singly&mdash;whether Honors
Or Insults, whether it be Joys or Sorrows,
They crowd together on us, or at best
Drop in in quick succession.

Fernandez (mocking him). 'Ne'er rains it, but it pours,' or, at the best, 190
'More sacks upon the mill.' This fellow's a
Perpetual plagiarist from his Grandmother, and
How slily in the parcel wraps [he] up
The stolen goods!

Earl Henry. Be somewhat briefer, Barnard.

Barnard. But could I dare insinuate to your Brother 195
A fearless Truth, Earl Henry&mdash;it were this:
Even Lucifer, Prince of the Air, hath claims
Upon our justice.

Fernandez. Give the Devil his Due!
Why, thou base Lacquerer of worm-eaten proverbs,
[And] wherefore dost thou not tell us at once 200
What the Chancellor said to thee?

Barnard (looking round superciliously at Fernandez).
The Queen hath left the Capital affecting
Rural retirement, but 'I will hasten'
(Thus said the Chancellor) 'I myself will hasten
And lay before her Majesty the Tidings 205
Both of Earl Henry's Victory and return.
She will vouchsafe, I doubt not, to re-enter
Her Capital, without delay, and grant
The wish'd for Audience with all public honour.'

Don Curio. A mere Device, I say, to pass a slight on us. 210


[1068]


Fernandez (to himself). To think on't. Pshaw! A fellow, that must needs
Have been decreed an Ass by acclamation,
Had he not looked so very like an Owl.
And he to&mdash;&mdash; (turns suddenly round, and faces Barnard who had even then come close beside him).
Boo!&mdash;&mdash;Ah! is it you, Sieur Barnard!

Barnard. No other, Sir!

Fernandez. And is it not reported, 215
That you once sav'd the General's life?

Barnard. 'Tis certain!

Fernandez. Was he asleep? And were the hunters coming
And did you bite him on the nose?

Barnard. What mean you?

Fernandez. That was the way in which the Flea i' th' Fable
Once sav'd the Lion's life.

Earl Henry. 'Tis well. 220
The Sun hath almost finish'd his Day's Travels;
We too will finish ours. Go, gallant Comrades,
And at the neighbouring Mansion, for us all,
Claim entertainment in your General's name.


Exeunt Soldiers, &amp;c. As they are leaving the Stage.


Fernandez (to Barnard). A word with you! You act the Chancellor 225
Incomparably well.

Barnard. Most valiant Captain,
Vouchsafe a manual union.

Fernandez (griping [sic] his hand with affected fervor). 'Tis no wonder,
Don Curio should mistook [sic] you for him.

Barnard. Truly,
The Chancellor, and I, it hath been notic'd
Are of one stature.

Fernandez. And Don Curio's Gripe too 230
Had lent a guttural Music to your voice,
[1069]A sort of bagpipe Buz, that suited well
Your dignity of utterance.

Barnard (simpering courteously). Don Fernandez,
Few are the storms that bring unmingled evil.

Fernandez (mocking him). 'Tis an ill wind, that blows no good, Sieur Barnard!      [Exeunt. 235


Don Curio lingering behind.


Don Curio. I have offended you, my brother.

Earl H. Yes!
For you've not learnt the noblest part of valour,
To suffer and obey. Drums put in cases,
Colours wound up&mdash;what means this Mummery?
We are sunk low indeed, if wrongs like our's 240
Must seek redress in impotent Freaks of Anger.
(This way, Don Sandoval) of boyish anger&mdash;&mdash;


(Walks with Sandoval to the back of the Stage.)


Don Curio (to himself). Freaks! freaks! But what if they have sav'd from bursting
The swelling heart of one, whose Cup of Hope
Was savagely dash'd down&mdash;even from his lips?&mdash; 245
Permitted just to see the face of War,
Then like a truant boy, scourgd home again
One Field my whole Campaign! One glorious Battle
To madden one with Hope!&mdash;Did he not pause
Twice in the fight, and press me to his breastplate, 250
And cry, that all might hear him, Well done, brother!
No blessed Soul, just naturalized in Heaven,
Pac'd ever by the side of an Immortal
More proudly, Henry! than I fought by thine&mdash;
Shame on these tears!&mdash;this, too, is boyish anger! [Exit. 255


Earl Henry and Sandoval return to the front of the stage.


Earl Henry. I spake more harshly to him, than need was.

Sandoval. Observ'd you how he pull'd his beaver down&mdash;
Doubtless to hide the tears, he could not check.

Earl Henry. Go, sooth [sic] him, Friend!&mdash;And having reach'd the Castle
Gain Oropeza's private ear, and tell her 260
Where you have left me.


(As Sandoval is going)


Nay, stay awhile with me.
I am too full of dreams to meet her now.


[1070]


Sandoval. You lov'd the daughter of Don Manrique?

Earl Henry. Loved?

Sandoval. Did you not say, you woo'd her?

Earl Henry. Once I lov'd
Her whom I dar'd not woo!&mdash;&mdash;

Sandoval. And woo'd perchance 265
One whom you lov'd not!

Earl Henry. O I were most base
Not loving Oropeza. True, I woo'd her
Hoping to heal a deeper wound: but she
Met my advances with an empassion'd Pride
That kindled Love with Love. And when her Sire 270
Who in his dream of Hope already grasp'd
The golden circlet in his hand, rejected
My suit, with Insult, and in memory
Of ancient Feuds, pour'd Curses on my head,
Her Blessings overtook and baffled them. 275
But thou art stern, and with unkindling Countenance
Art inly reasoning whilst thou listenest to me.

Sandoval. Anxiously, Henry! reasoning anxiously.
But Oropeza&mdash;

Earl Henry. Blessings gather round her!
Within this wood there winds a secret passage, 280
Beneath the walls, which open out at length
Into the gloomiest covert of the Garden.&mdash;
The night ere my departure to the Army,
She, nothing trembling, led me through that gloom,
And to the covert by a silent stream, 285
Which, with one star reflected near its marge,
Was the sole object visible around me.
The night so dark, so close, the umbrage o'er us!
No leaflet stirr'd;&mdash;yet pleasure hung upon us,
The gloom and stillness of the balmy night-air. 290
A little further on an arbor stood,
Fragrant with flowering Trees&mdash;I well remember
What an uncertain glimmer in the Darkness
Their snow-white Blossoms made&mdash;thither she led me,
[1071]To that sweet bower! Then Oropeza trembled&mdash; 295
I heard her heart beat&mdash;if 'twere not my own.

Sandoval. A rude and searing note, my friend!

Earl Henry. Oh! no!
I have small memory of aught but pleasure.
The inquietudes of fear, like lesser Streams
Still flowing, still were lost in those of Love: 300
So Love grew mightier from the Pear, and Nature,
Fleeing from Pain, shelter'd herself in Joy.
The stars above our heads were dim and steady,
Like eyes suffus'd with rapture. Life was in us:
We were all life, each atom of our Frames 305
A living soul&mdash;I vow'd to die for her:
With the faint voice of one who, having spoken,
Relapses into blessedness, I vow'd it:
That solemn Vow, a whisper scarcely heard,
A murmur breath'd against a lady's Cheek. 310
Oh! there is Joy above the name of Pleasure,
Deep self-possession, an intense Repose.
No other than as Eastern Sages feign,
The God, who floats upon a Lotos Leaf,
Dreams for a thousand ages; then awaking, 315
Creates a world, and smiling at the bubble,
Relapses into bliss. Ah! was that bliss
Fear'd as an alien, and too vast for man?
For suddenly, intolerant of its silence,
Did Oropeza, starting, grasp my forehead. 320
I caught her arms; the veins were swelling on them.
Thro' the dark Bower she sent a hollow voice;&mdash;
'Oh! what if all betray me? what if thou?'
I swore, and with an inward thought that seemed
[1072]The unity and substance of my Being, 325
I swore to her, that were she red with guilt,
I would exchange my unblench'd state with hers.&mdash;
Friend! by that winding passage, to the Bower
I now will go&mdash;all objects there will teach me
Unwavering Love, and singleness of Heart. 330
Go, Sandoval! I am prepar'd to meet her&mdash;
Say nothing of me&mdash;I myself will seek her&mdash;
Nay, leave me, friend! I cannot bear the torment
And Inquisition of that scanning eye.&mdash;


[Earl Henry retires into the wood.


Sandoval (alone). O Henry! always striv'st thou to be great 335
By thine own act&mdash;yet art thou never great
But by the Inspiration of great Passion.
The Whirl-blast comes, the desert-sands rise up
And shape themselves; from Heaven to Earth they stand,
As though they were the Pillars of a Temple, 340
Built by Omnipotence in its own honour!
But the Blast pauses, and their shaping spirit
Is fled: the mighty Columns were but sand,
And lazy Snakes trail o'er the level ruins!
I know, he loves the Queen. I know she is 345
His Soul's first love, and this is ever his nature&mdash;
To his first purpose, his soul toiling back
Like the poor storm-wreck'd [sailor] to his Boat,
Still swept away, still struggling to regain it. [Exit.





Herreras. He dies, that stirs! Follow me this instant. 350


(First Conspirator takes his arrow, snaps it, and throws it on the
ground. The two others do the same.)


Herreras. Accursed cowards! I'll go myself, and make sure work (drawing his Dagger).


[1073]
(Herreras strides towards the arbor, before he reaches it, stops and
listens and then returns hastily to the front of the stage, as he turns
his Back to the Arbor, Earl Henry appears, watching the Conspirators,
and enters the Arbor unseen.)


First Conspirator. Has she seen us think you?

The Mask. No! she has not seen us; but she heard us
distinctly.

Herreras. There was a rustling in the wood&mdash;go, all of 355
you, stand on the watch&mdash;towards the passage.

A Voice from the Arbor. Mercy! Mercy! Tell me, why
you murder me.

Herreras. I'll do it first. (Strides towards the Arbor, Earl
Henry rushes out of it.) 360

The Mask. Jesu Maria.


(They all three fly, Earl Henry
attempts to seize Herreras, who defending himself retreats
into the Covert follow'd by the Earl. The Queen comes
from out the arbor, veiled&mdash;stands listening a moment, then
lifts up her veil, with folded hands assumes the attitude of
Prayer, and after a momentary silence breaks into audible
soliloquy.)


The Queen. I pray'd to thee, All-wonderful! And thou
Didst make my very Prayer the Instrument,
By which thy Providence sav'd me. Th' armed Murderer
Who with suspended breath stood listening to me,
Groan'd as I spake thy name. In that same moment, 365
O God! thy Mercy shot the swift Remorse
That pierc'd his Heart. And like an Elephant
Gor'd as he rushes to the first assault,
He turn'd at once and trampled his Employers.
But hark! (drops her veil)&mdash;O God in Heaven! they come again. 370


(Earl Henry returns with the Dagger in his hand.)


Earl Henry (as he is entering). The violent pull with which I seiz'd his Dagger
Unpois'd me and I fell.

CHAMOUNY; THE HOUR BEFORE SUNRISE

A Hymn

[Vide ante, p. 376.]

[As published in The Morning Post, Sept. 11, 1802]



Hast thou a charm to stay the morning star
In his steep course&mdash;so long he seems to pause
On thy bald awful head, O Chamouny!
The Arv&egrave; and Arveiron at thy base
Eave ceaselessly; but thou, dread mountain form, 5
Resist from forth thy silent sea of pines
How silently! Around thee, and above,
Deep is the sky, and black: transpicuous, deep,
An ebon mass! Methinks thou piercest it
As with a wedge! But when I look again, 10
It seems thy own calm home, thy crystal shrine,
Thy habitation from eternity.
O dread and silent form! I gaz'd upon thee,
Till thou, still present to my bodily eye,
Did'st vanish from my thought. Entranc'd in pray'r, 15
I worshipp'd the Invisible alone.
Yet thou, meantime, wast working on my soul,
E'en like some deep enchanting melody,
So sweet, we know not, we are list'ning to it.
But I awoke, and with a busier mind, 20
And active will self-conscious, offer now
Not, as before, involuntary pray'r
And passive adoration!&mdash;
Hand and voice,
Awake, awake! and thou, my heart, awake!
Awake ye rocks! Ye forest pines, awake! 25
Green fields, and icy cliffs! All join my hymn!
And thou, O silent mountain, sole and bare,
O blacker, than the darkness, all the night,
And visited, all night, by troops of stars,
Or when they climb the sky, or when they sink&mdash; 30
Companion of the morning star at dawn,
Thyself Earth's rosy star, and of the dawn
Co-herald! Wake, O wake, and utter praise!
Who sank thy sunless pillars deep in earth?
Who fill'd thy countenance with rosy light? 35
Who made thee father of perpetual streams?
And you, ye five wild torrents, fiercely glad,
[1075]
Who call'd you forth from Night and utter Death?
From darkness let you loose, and icy dens,
Down those precipitous, black, jagged rocks 40
For ever shatter'd, and the same for ever!
Who gave you your invulnerable life,
Your strength, your speed, your fury, and your joy,
Unceasing thunder, and eternal foam!
And who commanded, and the silence came&mdash; 45
'Here shall the billows stiffen, and have rest?'

Ye ice-falls! ye that from yon dizzy heights
Adown enormous ravines steeply slope,
Torrents, methinks, that heard a mighty voice,
And stopp'd at once amid their maddest plunge! 50
Motionless torrents! silent cataracts!
Who made you glorious, as the gates of Heav'n,
Beneath the keen full moon? Who bade the sun
Clothe you with rainbows? Who with lovely flow'rs
Of living blue spread garlands at your feet? 55
God! God! The torrents like a shout of nations,
Utter! The ice-plain bursts, and answers God!
God, sing the meadow-streams with gladsome voice,
And pine groves with their soft, and soul-like sound,
The silent snow-mass, loos'ning, thunders God! 60
Ye dreadless flow'rs! that fringe th' eternal frost!
Ye wild goats, bounding by the eagle's nest!
Ye eagles, playmates of the mountain blast!
Ye lightnings, the dread arrows of the clouds!
Ye signs and wonders of the element, 65
Utter forth, God! and fill the hills with praise!

And thou, O silent Form, alone and bare,
Whom, as I lift again my head bow'd low
In adoration, I again behold,
And to thy summit upward from thy base 70
Sweep slowly with dim eyes suffus'd by tears,
Awake, thou mountain form! rise, like a cloud!
Rise, like a cloud of incense, from the earth!
Thou kingly spirit thron'd among the hills,
Thou dread ambassador from Earth to Heav'n&mdash; 75
Great hierarch, tell thou the silent sky,
And tell the stars, and tell the rising sun,
Earth with her thousand voices calls on God!

DEJECTION: AN ODE[1076:1]

[Vide ante, p. 362.]

[As first printed in the Morning Post, October 4, 1802.]



"Late, late yestreen I saw the new Moon
With the Old Moon in her arms;
And I fear, I fear, my Master dear,
We shall have a deadly storm."[1076:2]

DEJECTION:

AN ODE, WRITTEN APRIL 4, 1802.

I


Well! If the Bard was weather-wise, who made
The grand Old ballad of Sir Patrick Spence,
This night; so tranquil now, will not go hence
Unrous'd by winds, that ply a busier trade
Than those, which mould yon cloud, in lazy flakes, 5
Or the dull sobbing draft, that drones and rakes
Upon the strings of this &OElig;olian lute,
Which better far were mute.
For lo! the New Moon, winter-bright!
And overspread with phantom light, 10
[1077]
(With swimming phantom light o'erspread,
But rimm'd and circled by a silver thread)
I see the Old Moon in her lap, foretelling
The coming on of rain and squally blast:
And O! that even now the gust were swelling, 15
And the slant night-show'r driving loud and fast!
Those sounds which oft have rais'd me, while they aw'd,
And sent my soul abroad,
Might now perhaps their wonted impulse give,
Might startle this dull pain, and make it move and live! 20


II


A grief without a pang, void, dark, and drear,
A stifled, drowsy, unimpassion'd grief,
Which finds no nat'ral outlet, no relief,
In word, or sigh, or tear&mdash;
O Edmund! in this wan and heartless mood, 25
To other thoughts by yonder throstle woo'd,
All this long eve, so balmy and serene,
Have I been gazing on the Western sky,
And its peculiar tint of yellow-green:
And still I gaze&mdash;and with how blank an eye! 30
And those thin clouds above, in flakes and bars,
That give away their motion to the stars;
Those stars, that glide behind them, or between,
Now sparkling, now bedimm'd, but always seen;
Yon crescent moon, as fix'd as if it grew, 35
In its own cloudless, starless lake of blue,
A boat becalm'd! a lovely sky-canoe!
I see them all so excellently fair&mdash;
I see, not feel how beautiful they are!


[1078]
III


My genial spirits fail; 40
And what can these avail,
To lift the smoth'ring weight from off my breast?
It were a vain endeavour,
Though I should gaze for ever
On that green light that lingers in the west: 45
I may not hope from outward forms to win
The passion and the life, whose fountains are within.


IV


O Edmund! we receive but what we give,
And in our life alone does Nature live:
Ours is her wedding-garment, ours her shroud! 50
And would we aught behold, of higher worth,
Than that inanimate cold world, allow'd
To the poor loveless ever-anxious crowd,
Ah! from the soul itself must issue forth,
A light, a glory, a fair luminous cloud 55
Enveloping the earth&mdash;
And from the soul itself must there be sent
A sweet and potent voice, of its own birth,
Of all sweet sounds the life and element!
O pure of heart! Thou need'st not ask of me 60
What this strong music in the soul may be?
What, and wherein it doth exist,
This light, this glory, this fair luminous mist,
This beautiful and beauty-making pow'r?
Joy, virtuous Edmund! joy that ne'er was given, 65
Save to the pure, and in their purest hour,
Joy, Edmund! is the spirit and the pow'r,
Which wedding Nature to us gives in dow'r,
A new Earth and new Heaven,
Undream'd of by the sensual and the proud&mdash; 70
Joy is the sweet voice, Joy the luminous cloud&mdash;
We, we ourselves rejoice!
And thence flows all that charms or ear or sight,
All melodies the echoes of that voice,
All colours a suffusion from that light. 75


[1079]


Yes, dearest Edmund, yes!
There was a time that, tho' my path was rough,
This joy within me dallied with distress,
And all misfortunes were but as the stuff
Whence fancy made me dreams of happiness: 80
For hope grew round me, like the twining vine,
And fruits, and foliage, not my own, seem'd mine.
But now afflictions bow me down to earth:
Nor care I, that they rob me of my mirth,
But oh! each visitation 85
Suspends what nature gave me at my birth,
My shaping spirit of imagination.

O wherefore did I let it haunt my mind
This dark distressful dream?
I turn from it, and listen to the wind 90
Which long has rav'd unnotic'd. What a scream
Of agony, by torture, lengthen'd out,
That lute sent forth! O wind, that rav'st without,
Bare crag, or mountain-tairn[1079:1], or blasted tree,
Or pine-grove, whither woodman never clomb, 95
Or lonely house, long held the witches' home,
Methinks were fitter instruments for thee,
Mad Lutanist! who, in this month of show'rs,
Of dark-brown gardens, and of peeping flow'rs,
Mak'st devil's yule, with worse than wintry song, 100
The blossoms, buds, and tim'rous leaves among.
Thou Actor, perfect in all tragic sounds!
Thou mighty Poet, ev'n to frenzy bold!
[1080]
What tell'st thou now about?
'Tis of the rushing of a host in rout, 105
With many groans of men, with smarting wounds&mdash;
At once they groan with pain, and shudder with the cold!
But hush! there is a pause of deepest silence!
And all that noise, as of a rushing crowd,
With groans, and tremulous shudderings&mdash;all is over! 110
It tells another tale, with sounds less deep and loud&mdash;
A tale of less affright.
And temper'd with delight,
As Edmund's self had fram'd the tender lay&mdash;
'Tis of a little child, 115
Upon a lonesome wild
Not far from home; but she hath lost her way&mdash;
And now moans low, in utter grief and fear;
And now screams loud, and hopes to make her mother hear!


IX


'Tis midnight, and small thoughts have I of sleep; 120
Full seldom may my friend such vigils keep!
Visit him, gentle Sleep, with wings of healing,
And may this storm be but a mountain-birth,
May all the stars hang bright above his dwelling,
Silent, as though they watch'd the sleeping Earth! 125
With light heart may he rise,
Gay fancy, cheerful eyes,
And sing his lofty song, and teach me to rejoice!
O Edmund, friend of my devoutest choice,
O rais'd from anxious dread and busy care, 130
By the immenseness of the good and fair
Which thou see'st everywhere,
Joy lifts thy spirit, joy attunes thy voice,
[1081]
To thee do all things live from pole to pole,
Their life the eddying of thy living soul! 135
O simple spirit, guided from above,
O lofty Poet, full of life and love,
Brother and friend of my devoutest choice,
Thus may'st thou ever, evermore rejoice!

FOOTNOTES:

[1076:1] Collated with the text of the poem as sent to W.
Sotheby in a letter dated July 19, 1802 (Letters of S. T. C., 1895, i.
379-84).

[1076:2] In the letter of July 19, 1802, the Ode is broken up
and quoted in parts or fragments, illustrative of the mind and feelings
of the writer. 'Sickness,' he explains, 'first forced me into downright
metaphysics. For I believe that by nature I have more of the poet in
me. In a poem written during that dejection, to Wordsworth, I thus
expressed the thought in language more forcible than harmonious.' Then
follow lines 76-87 of the text, followed by lines 87-98 of the text
first published in Sibylline Leaves ('For not to think of what I needs
must feel,' &amp;c.). He then reverts to the 'introduction of the
poem':&mdash;'The first lines allude to a stanza in the Ballad of Sir Patrick
Spence: "Late, late yestreen I saw the new moon with the old one in her
arms: and I fear, I fear, my master dear, there will be a deadly
Storm."' This serves as a motto to lines 1-75 and 129-39 of the first
draft of the text. Finally he 'annexes as a fragment a few lines (ll.
88-119) on the "&OElig;olian Lute", it having been introduced in its
dronings in the first stanzas.'

[1079:1] Tairn, a small lake, generally, if not always, applied
to the lakes up in the mountains, and which are the feeders of those in
the vallies. This address to the wind will not appear extravagant to
those who have heard it at night, in a mountainous country. [Note in M.

(Vide ante, p. 403.)

LINES COMPOSED, FOR THE GREATER PART ON THE NIGHT,
ON WHICH HE FINISHED THE RECITATION OF HIS POEM
(IN THIRTEEN BOOKS) CONCERNING THE GROWTH
AND HISTORY OF HIS OWN MIND

Janry, 1807. Cole-orton, near Ashby de la Zouch.



O friend! O Teacher! God's great Gift to me!
Into my heart have I receiv'd that Lay,
More than historic, that prophetic Lay,
Wherein (high theme by Thee first sung aright)
Of the Foundations and the Building-up 5
Of thy own Spirit, thou hast lov'd to tell
What may be told, to th' understanding mind
Revealable; and what within the mind
May rise enkindled. Theme as hard as high!
Of Smiles spontaneous, and mysterious Feard; 10
(The First-born they of Reason, and Twin-birth)
Of Tides obedient to external Force,
And currents self-determin'd, as might seem,
Or by interior Power: of Moments aweful,
Now in thy hidden Life; and now abroad, 15
Mid festive Crowds, thy Brows too garlanded,
A Brother of the Feast: of Fancies fair,
Hybl&aelig;an Murmurs of poetic Thought,
Industrious in its Joy, by lilied Streams
Native or outland, Lakes and famous Hills! 20
[1082]Of more than Fancy, of the Hope of Man
Amid the tremor of a Realm aglow&mdash;
Where France in all her Towns lay vibrating,
Ev'n as a Bark becalm'd on sultry seas
Beneath the voice from Heaven, the bursting Crash 25
Of Heaven's immediate thunder! when no Cloud
Is visible, or Shadow on the Main!
Ah! soon night roll'd on night, and every Cloud
Open'd its eye of Fire: and Hope aloft
Now flutter'd, and now toss'd upon the Storm 30
Floating! Of Hope afflicted, and struck down,
Thence summon'd homeward&mdash;homeward to thy Heart,
Oft from the Watch-tower of Man's absolute Self,
With Light unwaning on her eyes, to look
Far on&mdash;herself a Glory to behold, 35
The Angel of the Vision! Then (last strain!)
Of Duty, chosen Laws controlling choice,
Virtue and Love! An Orphic Tale indeed,
A Tale divine of high and passionate Thoughts
To their own music chaunted!

Ah great Bard! 40
Ere yet that last Swell dying aw'd the Air,
With stedfast ken I view'd thee in the Choir
Of ever-enduring Men. The truly Great
Have all one Age, and from one visible space
Shed influence: for they, both power and act, 45
Are permanent, and Time is not with them,
Save as it worketh for them, they in it.
Nor less a sacred Roll, than those of old,
And to be plac'd, as they, with gradual fame
Among the Archives of mankind, thy Work 50
Makes audible a linked Song of Truth,
Of Truth profound a sweet continuous Song
Not learnt, but native, her own natural Notes!
Dear shall it be to every human Heart.
To me how more than dearest! Me, on whom 55
Comfort from Thee and utterance of thy Love
Came with such heights and depths of Harmony
Such sense of Wings uplifting, that the Storm
Scatter'd and whirl'd me, till my Thoughts became
A bodily Tumult! and thy faithful Hopes, 60
[1083]Thy Hopes of me, dear Friend! by me unfelt
Were troublous to me, almost as a Voice
Familiar once and more than musical
To one cast forth, whose hope had seem'd to die,
A Wanderer with a worn-out heart, [sic] 65
Mid Strangers pining with untended Wounds!

O Friend! too well thou know'st, of what sad years
The long suppression had benumb'd my soul,
That even as Life returns upon the Drown'd,
Th' unusual Joy awoke a throng of Pains&mdash; 70
Keen Pangs of Love, awakening, as a Babe,
Turbulent, with an outcry in the Heart:
And Fears self-will'd, that shunn'd the eye of Hope,
And Hope, that would not know itself from Fear:
Sense of pass'd Youth, and Manhood come in vain; 75
And Genius given, and knowledge won in vain;
And all, which I had cull'd in Wood-walks wild,
And all, which patient Toil had rear'd, and all,
Commune with Thee had open'd out, but Flowers
Strew'd on my Corse, and borne upon my Bier, 80
In the same Coffin, for the self-same Grave!

That way no more! and ill beseems it me,
Who came a Welcomer in Herald's guise
Singing of Glory and Futurity,
To wander back on such unhealthful Road 85
Plucking the Poisons of Self-harm! and ill
Such Intertwine beseems triumphal wreaths
Strew'd before thy Advancing! Thou too, Friend!
O injure not the memory of that Hour
Of thy communion with my nobler mind 90
By pity or grief, already felt too long!
Nor let my words import more blame than needs.
The Tumult rose and ceas'd: for Peace is nigh
Where Wisdom's Voice has found a list'ning Heart.
Amid the howl of more than wintry Storms 95
The Halcyon hears the voice of vernal Hours,
Already on the wing!

Eve following eve,
Dear tranquil Time, when the sweet sense of Home
Becomes most sweet! hours for their own sake hail'd,
And more desir'd, more precious, for thy song! 100
In silence list'ning, like a devout Child,
[1084]
My soul lay passive; by thy various strain
Driven as in surges now, beneath the stars,
With momentary Stars of my own Birth,
Fair constellated Foam still darting off 105
Into the darkness! now a tranquil Sea
Outspread and bright, yet swelling to the Moon!

And when O Friend! my Comforter! my Guide!
Strong in thyself and powerful to give strength!
Thy long sustained Lay finally clos'd, 110
And thy deep Voice had ceas'd (yet thou thyself
Wert still before mine eyes, and round us both
That happy Vision of beloved Faces!
All, whom I deepliest love, in one room all!),
Scarce conscious and yet conscious of it's Close, 115
I sate, my Being blended in one Thought,
(Thought was it? or aspiration? or Resolve?)
Absorb'd, yet hanging still upon the sound:
And when I rose, I found myself in Prayer!


S. T. Coleridge.

That only serves to make us grieve,
Now I am old. 50

In vain I supplicate the Powers above;
There is no Resurrection for the Love
That, nursed with tenderest care, yet fades away
In the chilled heart by inward self-decay.
[1088]Like a lorn Arab old and blind 5
Some caravan had left behind
That sits beside a ruined Well,
And hangs his wistful head aslant,
Some sound he fain would catch&mdash;
Suspended there, as it befell, 10
O'er my own vacancy,
And while I seemed to watch
The sickly calm, as were of heart
A place where Hope lay dead,
The spirit of departed Love 15
Stood close beside my bed.
She bent methought to kiss my lips
As she was wont to do.
Alas! 'twas with a chilling breath
That awoke just enough of life in death 20
To make it die anew.

APPENDIX II

ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1]

A feeling of sadness, a peculiar melancholy, is wont to take
possession of me alike in Spring and in Autumn. But in Spring
it is the melancholy of Hope: in Autumn it is the melancholy
of Resignation. As I was journeying on foot through the
Appennine, I fell in with a pilgrim in whom the Spring and 5
the Autumn and the Melancholy of both seemed to have
combined. In his discourse there were the freshness and the
colours of April:


Qual ramicel a ramo,
Tal da pensier pensiero 10
In lui germogliava.


[1092]
But as I gazed on his whole form and figure, I bethought me
of the not unlovely decays, both of age and of the late season,
in the stately elm, after the clusters have been plucked from
its entwining vines, and the vines are as bands of dried withies 15
around its trunk and branches. Even so there was a memory
on his smooth and ample forehead, which blended with the
dedication of his steady eyes, that still looked&mdash;I know not,
whether upward, or far onward, or rather to the line of meeting
where the sky rests upon the distance. But how may I express 20
that dimness of abstraction which lay on the lustre of the
pilgrim's eyes like the flitting tarnish from the breath of a sigh
on a silver mirror! and which accorded with their slow and
reluctant movement, whenever he turned them to any object
on the right hand or on the left? It seemed, methought, as 25
if there lay upon the brightness a shadowy presence of
disappointments now unfelt, but never forgotten. It was at once
the melancholy of hope and of resignation.

We had not long been fellow-travellers, ere a sudden tempest
of wind and rain forced us to seek protection in the vaulted 30
door-way of a lone chapelry; and we sate face to face each on
the stone bench alongside the low, weather-stained wall, and
as close as possible to the massy door.

After a pause of silence: even thus, said he, like two strangers
that have fled to the same shelter from the same storm, not 35
seldom do Despair and Hope meet for the first time in the
porch of Death! All extremes meet, I answered; but yours
was a strange and visionary thought. The better then doth it
beseem both the place and me, he replied. From a Visionary
wilt thou hear a Vision? Mark that vivid flash through this 40
torrent of rain! Fire and water. Even here thy adage holds
true, and its truth is the moral of my Vision. I entreated him
to proceed. Sloping his face toward the arch and yet averting
his eye from it, he seemed to seek and prepare his words: till
listening to the wind that echoed within the hollow edifice, 45
and to the rain without,


Which stole on his thoughts with its two-fold sound,
The clash hard by and the murmur all round,[1092:1]


he gradually sank away, alike from me and from his own purpose,
and amid the gloom of the storm and in the duskiness of that 50
[1093]
place, he sate like an emblem on a rich man's sepulchre, or like a
mourner on the sodded grave of an only one&mdash;an aged mourner,
who is watching the waned moon and sorroweth not. Starting
at length from his brief trance of abstraction, with courtesy and
an atoning smile he renewed his discourse, and commenced his 55
parable.

During one of those short furloughs from the service of the
body, which the soul may sometimes obtain even in this its
militant state, I found myself in a vast plain, which I
immediately knew to be the Valley of Life. It possessed an 60
astonishing diversity of soils: here was a sunny spot, and
there a dark one, forming just such a mixture of sunshine and
shade, as we may have observed on the mountains' side in an
April day, when the thin broken clouds are scattered over
heaven. Almost in the very entrance of the valley stood 65
a large and gloomy pile, into which I seemed constrained to
enter. Every part of the building was crowded with tawdry
ornaments and fantastic deformity. On every window was
portrayed, in glaring and inelegant colours, some horrible tale,
or preternatural incident, so that not a ray of light could enter, 70
untinged by the medium through which it passed. The body
of the building was full of people, some of them dancing, in and out,
in unintelligible figures, with strange ceremonies and antic
merriment, while others seemed convulsed with horror, or
pining in mad melancholy. Intermingled with these, I observed 75
a number of men, clothed in ceremonial robes, who appeared
now to marshal the various groups, and to direct their
movements; and now with menacing countenances, to drag some
reluctant victim to a vast idol, framed of iron bars intercrossed,
which formed at the same time an immense cage, and the shape 80
of a human Colossus.

I stood for a while lost in wonder what these things might
mean; when lo! one of the directors came up to me, and with
a stern and reproachful look bade me uncover my head, for
that the place into which I had entered was the temple of 85
the only true Religion, in the holier recesses of which the
great Goddess personally resided. Himself too he bade me
reverence, as the consecrated minister of her rites. Awestruck
by the name of Religion, I bowed before the priest, and humbly
[1094]
and earnestly intreated him to conduct me into her presence. 90
He assented. Offerings he took from me, with mystic
sprinklings of water and with salt he purified, and with strange
sufflations he exorcised me; and then led me through many
a dark and winding alley, the dew-damps of which chilled my
flesh, and the hollow echoes under my feet, mingled, methought, 95
with moanings, affrighted me. At length we entered a large
hall, without window, or spiracle, or lamp. The asylum and
dormitory it seemed of perennial night&mdash;only that the walls were
brought to the eye by a number of self-luminous inscriptions in
letters of a pale sepulchral light, which held strange neutrality 100
with the darkness, on the verge of which it kept its rayless vigil.
I could read them, methought; but though each of the words
taken separately I seemed to understand, yet when I took them
in sentences, they were riddles and incomprehensible. As I
stood meditating on these hard sayings, my guide thus addressed 105
me&mdash;'Read and believe: these are mysteries!'&mdash;At the
extremity of the vast hall the Goddess was placed. Her features,
blended with darkness, rose out to my view, terrible, yet vacant.
I prostrated myself before her, and then retired with my guide,
soul-withered, and wondering, and dissatisfied. 110

As I re-entered the body of the temple I heard a deep buzz
as of discontent. A few whose eyes were bright, and either
piercing or steady, and whose ample foreheads, with the weighty
bar, ridge-like, above the eyebrows, bespoke observation followed
by meditative thought; and a much larger number, who were 115
enraged by the severity and insolence of the priests in exacting
their offerings, had collected in one tumultuous group, and with
a confused outcry of 'This is the Temple of Superstition!' after
much contumely, and turmoil, and cruel maltreatment on all
sides, rushed out of the pile: and I, methought, joined them. 120

We speeded from the Temple with hasty steps, and had now
nearly gone round half the valley, when we were addressed by
a woman, tall beyond the stature of mortals, and with a
something more than human in her countenance and mien, which
yet could by mortals be only felt, not conveyed by words or 125
intelligibly distinguished. Deep reflection, animated by ardent
feelings, was displayed in them: and hope, without its
uncertainty, and a something more than all these, which I understood
[1095]
not, but which yet seemed to blend all these into a divine unity
of expression. Her garments were white and matronly, and of 130
the simplest texture. We inquired her name. 'My name,' she
replied, 'is Religion.'

The more numerous part of our company, affrighted by the
very sound, and sore from recent impostures or sorceries,
hurried onwards and examined no farther. A few of us, struck 135
by the manifest opposition of her form and manners to those
of the living Idol, whom we had so recently abjured, agreed to
follow her, though with cautious circumspection. She led us to
an eminence in the midst of the valley, from the top of which
we could command the whole plain, and observe the relation of 140
the different parts to each other, and of each to the whole, and
of all to each. She then gave us an optic glass which assisted
without contradicting our natural vision, and enabled us to see
far beyond the limits of the Valley of Life; though our eye
even thus assisted permitted us only to behold a light and 145
a glory, but what we could not descry, save only that it was,
and that it was most glorious.

And now with the rapid transition of a dream, I had overtaken
and rejoined the more numerous party, who had abruptly
left us, indignant at the very name of religion. They journied 150
on, goading each other with remembrances of past oppressions,
and never looking back, till in the eagerness to recede from the
Temple of Superstition they had rounded the whole circle of the
valley. And lo! there faced us the mouth of a vast cavern, at
the base of a lofty and almost perpendicular rock, the interior 155
side of which, unknown to them and unsuspected, formed the
extreme and backward wall of the Temple. An impatient
crowd, we entered the vast and dusky cave, which was the only
perforation of the precipice. At the mouth of the cave sate
two figures; the first, by her dress and gestures, I knew to be 160
Sensuality; the second form, from the fierceness of his demeanour,
and the brutal scornfulness of his looks, declared himself
to be the monster Blasphemy. He uttered big words, and yet
ever and anon I observed that he turned pale at his own
courage. We entered. Some remained in the opening of the 165
cave, with the one or the other of its guardians. The rest, and
I among them, pressed on, till we reached an ample chamber,
that seemed the centre of the rock. The climate of the place
was unnaturally cold.

In the furthest distance of the chamber sate an old dim-eyed 170
man, poring with a microscope over the torso of a statue
which had neither basis, nor feet, nor head; but on its breast
was carved Nature! To this he continually applied his glass,
and seemed enraptured with the various inequalities which it
[1096]
rendered visible on the seemingly polished surface of the 175
marble.&mdash;Yet evermore was this delight and triumph followed
by expressions of hatred, and vehement railing against a Being,
who yet, he assured us, had no existence. This mystery
suddenly recalled to me what I had read in the holiest recess
of the temple of Superstition. The old man spake in divers 180
tongues, and continued to utter other and most strange
mysteries. Among the rest he talked much and vehemently
concerning an infinite series of causes and effects, which he
explained to be a string of blind men, the last of whom
caught hold of the skirt of the one before him, he of the next, 185
and so on till they were all out of sight; and that they all
walked infallibly straight, without making one false step
though all were alike blind. Methought I borrowed courage
from surprise, and asked him&mdash;Who then is at the head to
guide them? He looked at me with ineffable contempt, not 190
unmixed with an angry suspicion, and then replied, 'No one.'
The string of blind men went on for ever without any beginning;
for although one blind man could not move without stumbling,
yet infinite blindness supplied the want of sight. I burst into
laughter, which instantly turned to terror&mdash;for as he started 195
forward in rage, I caught a glimpse of him from behind; and
lo! I beheld a monster bi-form and Janus-headed, in the hinder
face and shape of which I instantly recognised the dread
countenance of Superstition&mdash;and in the terror I awoke.

[1091:1] First published in The Courier, Saturday, August 31,
1811: included in 1829, 1834-5, &amp;c. (3 vols.), and in 1844 (1 vol.).
Lines 1-56 were first published as part of the 'Introduction' to A Lay
Sermon, &amp;c., 1817, pp. xix-xxxi.

The 'Allegoric Vision' dates from August, 1795. It served as a kind of
preface or prologue to Coleridge's first Theological Lecture on 'The
Origin of Evil. The Necessity of Revelation deduced from the Nature of
Man. An Examination and Defence of the Mosaic Dispensation' (see
Cottle's Early Recollections, 1837, i. 27). The purport of these
Lectures was to uphold the golden mean of Unitarian orthodoxy as opposed
to the Church on the one hand, and infidelity or materialism on the
other. 'Superstition' stood for and symbolized the Church of England.
Sixteen years later this opening portion of an unpublished Lecture was
rewritten and printed in The Courier (Aug. 31, 1811), with the heading
'An Allegoric Vision: Superstition, Religion, Atheism'. The attack was
now diverted from the Church of England to the Church of Rome. 'Men clad
in black robes,' intent on gathering in their Tenths, become 'men
clothed in ceremonial robes, who with menacing countenances drag some
reluctant victim to a vast idol, framed of iron bars intercrossed which
formed at the same time an immense cage, and yet represented the form of
a human Colossus. At the base of the Statue I saw engraved the words "To
Dominic holy and merciful, the preventer and avenger of soul-murder".'
The vision was turned into a political jeu d'esprit levelled at the
aiders and abettors of Catholic Emancipation, a measure to which
Coleridge was more or less opposed as long as he lived. See
Constitution of Church and State, 1830, passim. A third adaptation
of the 'Allegorical Vision' was affixed to the Introduction to A Lay
Sermon: Addressed to the Higher and Middle Classes, which was published
in 1817. The first fifty-six lines, which contain a description of
Italian mountain scenery, were entirely new, but the rest of the
'Vision' is an amended and softened reproduction of the preface to the
Lecture of 1795. The moral he desires to point is the 'falsehood of
extremes'. As Religion is the golden mean between Superstition and
Atheism, so the righteous government of a righteous people is the mean
between a selfish and oppressive aristocracy, and seditious and
unbridled mob-rule. A probable 'Source' of the first draft of the
'Vision' is John Aikin's Hill of Science, A Vision, which was included
in Elegant Extracts, 1794, ii. 801. In the present issue the text of
1834 has been collated with that of 1817 and 1829, but not
(exhaustively) with the MS. (1795), or at all with the Courier version
of 1811.

APOLOGETIC PREFACE TO 'FIRE, FAMINE,
AND SLAUGHTER'[1097:1]

At the house of a gentleman[1097:2] who by the principles and
corresponding virtues of a sincere Christian consecrates a
cultivated genius and the favourable accidents of birth, opulence,
and splendid connexions, it was my good fortune to meet, in
a dinner-party, with more men of celebrity in science or polite 5
literature than are commonly found collected round the same
table. In the course of conversation, one of the party reminded
an illustrious poet [Scott], then present, of some verses which
he had recited that morning, and which had appeared in
a newspaper under the name of a War-Eclogue, in which Fire, 10
Famine, and Slaughter were introduced as the speakers. The
gentleman so addressed replied, that he was rather surprised
that none of us should have noticed or heard of the poem, as it
had been, at the time, a good deal talked of in Scotland. It
may be easily supposed that my feelings were at this moment 15
not of the most comfortable kind. Of all present, one only [Sir
H. Davy] knew, or suspected me to be the author; a man who
would have established himself in the first rank of England's
living poets[1097:3], if the Genius of our country had not decreed that
[1098]
he should rather be the first in the first rank of its philosophers 20
and scientific benefactors. It appeared the general wish to
hear the lines. As my friend chose to remain silent, I chose
to follow his example, and Mr.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [Scott] recited the poem.
This he could do with the better grace, being known to have
ever been not only a firm and active Anti-Jacobin and 25
Anti-Gallican, but likewise a zealous admirer of Mr. Pitt, both as
a good man and a great statesman. As a poet exclusively, he
had been amused with the Eclogue; as a poet he recited it;
and in a spirit which made it evident that he would have read
and repeated it with the same pleasure had his own name been 30
attached to the imaginary object or agent.

After the recitation our amiable host observed that in his
opinion Mr.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. had over-rated the merits of the poetry;
but had they been tenfold greater, they could not have
compensated for that malignity of heart which could alone have 35
prompted sentiments so atrocious. I perceived that my
illustrious friend became greatly distressed on my account; but
fortunately I was able to preserve fortitude and presence of
mind enough to take up the subject without exciting even
a suspicion how nearly and painfully it interested me. 40

What follows is the substance of what I then replied, but
dilated and in language less colloquial. It was not my intention,
I said, to justify the publication, whatever its author's feelings
might have been at the time of composing it. That they are
calculated to call forth so severe a reprobation from a good man, 45
is not the worst feature of such poems. Their moral deformity
is aggravated in proportion to the pleasure which they are
capable of affording to vindictive, turbulent, and unprincipled
readers. Could it be supposed, though for a moment, that the
author seriously wished what he had thus wildly imagined, 50
even the attempt to palliate an inhumanity so monstrous would
be an insult to the hearers. But it seemed to me worthy of
consideration, whether the mood of mind and the general state
of sensations in which a poet produces such vivid and fantastic
images, is likely to co-exist, or is even compatible with, that 55
gloomy and deliberate ferocity which a serious wish to realize
them would pre-suppose. It had been often observed, and all
my experience tended to confirm the observation, that prospects
of pain and evil to others, and in general all deep feelings of
revenge, are commonly expressed in a few words, ironically tame, 60
and mild. The mind under so direful and fiend-like an influence
seems to take a morbid pleasure in contrasting the intensity of
its wishes and feelings with the slightness or levity of the
expressions by which they are hinted; and indeed feelings
so intense and solitary, if they were not precluded (as in almost 65
all cases they would be) by a constitutional activity of fancy
[1099]
and association, and by the specific joyousness combined with it,
would assuredly themselves preclude such activity. Passion, in
its own quality, is the antagonist of action; though in an
ordinary and natural degree the former alternates with the latter, 70
and thereby revives and strengthens it. But the more intense
and insane the passion is, the fewer and the more fixed are the
correspondent forms and notions. A rooted hatred, an inveterate
thirst of revenge, is a sort of madness, and still eddies round its
favourite object, and exercises as it were a perpetual tautology 75
of mind in thoughts and words which admit of no adequate
substitutes. Like a fish in a globe of glass, it moves restlessly
round and round the scanty circumference, which it cannot
leave without losing its vital element.

There is a second character of such imaginary representations 80
as spring from a real and earnest desire of evil to another,
which we often see in real life, and might even anticipate from
the nature of the mind. The images, I mean, that a vindictive
man places before his imagination, will most often be taken
from the realities of life: they will be images of pain and 85
suffering which he has himself seen inflicted on other men, and
which he can fancy himself as inflicting on the object of his
hatred. I will suppose that we had heard at different times
two common sailors, each speaking of some one who had
wronged or offended him: that the first with apparent violence 90
had devoted every part of his adversary's body and soul to all
the horrid phantoms and fantastic places that ever Quevedo
dreamt of, and this in a rapid flow of those outrageous and wildly
combined execrations, which too often with our lower classes
serve for escape-valves to carry off the excess of their passions, 95
as so much superfluous steam that would endanger the vessel if
it were retained. The other, on the contrary, with that sort of
calmness of tone which is to the ear what the paleness of anger
is to the eye, shall simply say, 'If I chance to be made
boatswain, as I hope I soon shall, and can but once get that 100
fellow under my hand (and I shall be upon the watch for him),
I'll tickle his pretty skin! I won't hurt him! oh no! I'll only
cut the &mdash; &mdash; to the liver!' I dare appeal to all present, which
of the two they would regard as the least deceptive symptom
of deliberate malignity? nay, whether it would surprise them 105
to see the first fellow, an hour or two afterwards, cordially
shaking hands with the very man the fractional parts of whose
body and soul he had been so charitably disposing of; or even
perhaps risking his life for him? What language Shakespeare
considered characteristic of malignant disposition we see in the 110
speech of the good-natured Gratiano, who spoke 'an infinite
deal of nothing more than any man in all Venice';


&mdash;&mdash;Too wild, too rude and bold of voice!


[1100]
the skipping spirit, whose thoughts and words reciprocally ran
away with each other; 115


&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;O be them damn'd, inexorable dog!
And for thy life let justice be accused!


and the wild fancies that follow, contrasted with Shylock's
tranquil 'I stand here for Law'.

Or, to take a case more analogous to the present subject, 120
should we hold it either fair or charitable to believe it to have
been Dante's serious wish that all the persons mentioned by
him (many recently departed, and some even alive at the time,)
should actually suffer the fantastic and horrible punishments to
which he has sentenced them in his Hell and Purgatory? 125
Or what shall we say of the passages in which Bishop Jeremy
Taylor anticipates the state of those who, vicious themselves,
have been the cause of vice and misery to their fellow-creatures?
Could we endure for a moment to think that a spirit, like
Bishop Taylor's, burning with Christian love; that a man 130
constitutionally overflowing with pleasurable kindliness; who
scarcely even in a casual illustration introduces the image of
woman, child, or bird, but he embalms the thought with so
rich a tenderness, as makes the very words seem beauties and
fragments of poetry from Euripides or Simonides;&mdash;can we 135
endure to think, that a man so natured and so disciplined, did
at the time of composing this horrible picture, attach a sober
feeling of reality to the phrases? or that he would have
described in the same tone of justification, in the same luxuriant
flow of phrases, the tortures about to be inflicted on a living 140
individual by a verdict of the Star-Chamber? or the still more
atrocious sentences executed on the Scotch anti-prelatists and
schismatics, at the command, and in some instances under the
very eye of the Duke of Lauderdale, and of that wretched bigot
who afterwards dishonoured and forfeited the throne of Great 145
Britain? Or do we not rather feel and understand, that these
violent words were mere bubbles, flashes and electrical
apparitions, from the magic cauldron of a fervid and ebullient fancy,
constantly fuelled by an unexampled opulence of language?

Were I now to have read by myself for the first time the poem 150
in question, my conclusion, I fully believe, would be, that the
writer must have been some man of warm feelings and active
fancy; that he had painted to himself the circumstances that
accompany war in so many vivid and yet fantastic forms, as
proved that neither the images nor the feelings were the result 155
of observation, or in any way derived from realities. I should
judge that they were the product of his own seething imagination,
and therefore impregnated with that pleasurable exultation
which is experienced in all energetic exertion of intellectual
power; that in the same mood he had generalized the causes of 160
[1101]
the war, and then personified the abstract and christened it by
the name which he had been accustomed to hear most often
associated with its management and measures. I should guess
that the minister was in the author's mind at the moment of
composition as completely &#7936;&#960;&#945;&#952;&#8052;&#962;, &#7936;&#957;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#8057;&#963;&#945;&#961;&#954;&#959;&#962;, as Anacreon's 165
grasshopper, and that he had as little notion of a real person of
flesh and blood,


Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb,
[Paradise Lost, II. 668.]


as Milton had in the grim and terrible phantom (half person,
half allegory) which he has placed at the gates of Hell. I 170
concluded by observing, that the poem was not calculated to excite
passion in any mind, or to make any impression except on
poetic readers; and that from the culpable levity betrayed
at the close of the eclogue by the grotesque union of epigrammatic
wit with allegoric personification, in the allusion to the 175
most fearful of thoughts, I should conjecture that the 'rantin'
Bardie', instead of really believing, much less wishing, the fate
spoken of in the last line, in application to any human individual,
would shrink from passing the verdict even on the Devil himself,
and exclaim with poor Burns, 180


But fare ye weel, auld Nickie-ben!
Oh! wad ye tak a thought an' men!
Ye aiblins might&mdash;I dinna ken&mdash;
Still hae a stake&mdash;
I'm wae to think upon yon den, 185
Ev'n for your sake!


I need not say that these thoughts, which are here dilated,
were in such a company only rapidly suggested. Our kind
host smiled, and with a courteous compliment observed, that
the defence was too good for the cause. My voice faltered 190
a little, for I was somewhat agitated; though not so much on
my own account as for the uneasiness that so kind and friendly
a man would feel from the thought that he had been the
occasion of distressing me. At length I brought out these words:
'I must now confess, sir! that I am author of that poem. It 195
was written some years ago. I do not attempt to justify my
past self, young as I then was; but as little as I would now
write a similar poem, so far was I even then from imagining
that the lines would be taken as more or less than a sport
of fancy. At all events, if I know my own heart, there was 200
never a moment in my existence in which I should have been
more ready, had Mr. Pitt's person been in hazard, to interpose
my own body, and defend his life at the risk of my own.'

I have prefaced the poem with this anecdote, because to have
printed it without any remark might well have been understood 205
[1102]
as implying an unconditional approbation on my part, and this
after many years' consideration. But if it be asked why I
republished it at all, I answer, that the poem had been attributed
at different times to different other persons; and what I had
dared beget, I thought it neither manly nor honourable not to 210
dare father. From the same motives I should have published
perfect copies of two poems, the one entitled The Devil's
Thoughts, and the other, The Two Round Spaces on the
Tombstone, but that the three first stanzas of the former, which
were worth all the rest of the poem, and the best stanza of the 215
remainder, were written by a friend [Southey] of deserved
celebrity; and because there are passages in both which might
have given offence to the religious feelings of certain readers.
I myself indeed see no reason why vulgar superstitions and
absurd conceptions that deform the pure faith of a Christian 220
should possess a greater immunity from ridicule than stories of
witches, or the fables of Greece and Rome. But there are those
who deem it profaneness and irreverence to call an ape an ape,
if it but wear a monk's cowl on its head; and I would rather
reason with this weakness than offend it. 225

The passage from Jeremy Taylor to which I referred is found
in his second Sermon on Christ's Advent to Judgment; which
is likewise the second in his year's course of sermons. Among
many remarkable passages of the same character in those
discourses, I have selected this as the most so. 'But when this 230
Lion of the tribe of Judah shall appear, then Justice shall strike,
and Mercy shall not hold her hands; she shall strike sore strokes,
and Pity shall not break the blow. As there are treasures of
good things, so hath God a treasure of wrath and fury, and
scourges and scorpions; and then shall be produced the shame 235
of Lust and the malice of Envy, and the groans of the oppressed
and the persecutions of the saints, and the cares of Covetousness
and the troubles of Ambition, and the insolencies of traitors and
the violences of rebels, and the rage of anger and the uneasiness
of impatience, and the restlessness of unlawful desires; and by 240
this time the monsters and diseases will be numerous and
intolerable, when God's heavy hand shall press the sanies and
the intolerableness, the obliquity and the unreasonableness, the
amazement and the disorder, the smart and the sorrow, the
guilt and the punishment, out from all our sins, and pour them 245
into one chalice, and mingle them with an infinite wrath, and
make the wicked drink off all the vengeance, and force it down
their unwilling throats with the violence of devils and accursed
spirits.'

That this Tartarean drench displays the imagination rather 250
than the discretion of the compounder; that, in short, this
passage and others of the same kind are in a bad taste, few will deny
[1103]
at the present day. It would, doubtless, have more behoved
the good bishop not to be wise beyond what is written on
a subject in which Eternity is opposed to Time, and a Death 255
threatened, not the negative, but the positive Opposite of Life;
a subject, therefore, which must of necessity be indescribable
to the human understanding in our present state. But I can
neither find nor believe that it ever occurred to any reader to
ground on such passages a charge against Bishop Taylor's 260
humanity, or goodness of heart. I was not a little surprised
therefore to find, in the Pursuits of Literature and other works,
so horrible a sentence passed on Milton's moral character, for
a passage in his prose writings, as nearly parallel to this of
Taylor's as two passages can well be conceived to be. All his 265
merits, as a poet, forsooth&mdash;all the glory of having written the
Paradise Lost, are light in the scale, nay, kick the beam,
compared with the atrocious malignity of heart, expressed in the
offensive paragraph. I remembered, in general, that Milton had
concluded one of his works on Reformation, written in the 270
fervour of his youthful imagination, in a high poetic strain, that
wanted metre only to become a lyrical poem. I remembered
that in the former part he had formed to himself a perfect ideal
of human virtue, a character of heroic, disinterested zeal and
devotion for Truth, Religion, and public Liberty, in act and in 275
suffering, in the day of triumph and in the hour of martyrdom.
Such spirits, as more excellent than others, he describes as
having a more excellent reward, and as distinguished by a
transcendant glory: and this reward and this glory he displays and
particularizes with an energy and brilliance that announced the 280
Paradise Lost as plainly, as ever the bright purple clouds in the
east announced the coming of the Sun. Milton then passes to
the gloomy contrast, to such men as from motives of selfish
ambition and the lust of personal aggrandizement should, against
their own light, persecute truth and the true religion, and 285
wilfully abuse the powers and gifts entrusted to them, to bring
vice, blindness, misery and slavery, on their native country, on
the very country that had trusted, enriched and honoured them.
Such beings, after that speedy and appropriate removal from
their sphere of mischief which all good and humane men must 290
of course desire, will, he takes for granted by parity of reason,
meet with a punishment, an ignominy, and a retaliation, as
much severer than other wicked men, as their guilt and its
consequences were more enormous. His description of this
imaginary punishment presents more distinct pictures to the 295
fancy than the extract from Jeremy Taylor; but the thoughts
in the latter are incomparably more exaggerated and horrific.
All this I knew; but I neither remembered, nor by reference
[1104]
and careful re-perusal could discover, any other meaning, either
in Milton or Taylor, but that good men will be rewarded, and 300
the impenitent wicked, punished, in proportion to their
dispositions and intentional acts in this life; and that if the
punishment of the least wicked be fearful beyond conception, all words
and descriptions must be so far true, that they must fall short
of the punishment that awaits the transcendantly wicked. Had 305
Milton stated either his ideal of virtue, or of depravity, as an
individual or individuals actually existing? Certainly not!
Is this representation worded historically, or only
hypothetically? Assuredly the latter! Does he express it as his own
wish that after death they should suffer these tortures? or as 310
a general consequence, deduced from reason and revelation, that
such will be their fate? Again, the latter only! His wish is
expressly confined to a speedy stop being put by Providence to
their power of inflicting misery on others! But did he name
or refer to any persons living or dead? No! But the 315
calumniators of Milton daresay (for what will calumny not dare say?)
that he had Laud and Strafford in his mind, while writing of
remorseless persecution, and the enslavement of a free country
from motives of selfish ambition. Now what if a stern
anti-prelatist should daresay, that in speaking of the insolencies of 320
traitors and the violences of rebels, Bishop Taylor must have
individualised in his mind Hampden, Hollis, Pym, Fairfax,
Ireton, and Milton? And what if he should take the liberty of
concluding, that, in the after-description, the Bishop was feeding
and feasting his party-hatred, and with those individuals before 325
the eyes of his imagination enjoying, trait by trait, horror after
horror, the picture of their intolerable agonies? Yet this
bigot would have an equal right thus to criminate the one good
and great man, as these men have to criminate the other.
Milton has said, and I doubt not but that Taylor with equal 330
truth could have said it, 'that in his whole life he never spake
against a man even that his skin should be grazed.' He asserted
this when one of his opponents (either Bishop Hall or his
nephew) had called upon the women and children in the streets
to take up stones and stone him (Milton). It is known that 335
Milton repeatedly used his interest to protect the royalists;
but even at a time when all lies would have been meritorious
against him, no charge was made, no story pretended, that he
had ever directly or indirectly engaged or assisted in their
persecution. Oh! methinks there are other and far better feelings 340
which should be acquired by the perusal of our great elder
writers. When I have before me, on the same table, the works
of Hammond and Baxter; when I reflect with what joy and
dearness their blessed spirits are now loving each other; it
seems a mournful thing that their names should be perverted to 345
[1105]
an occasion of bitterness among us, who are enjoying that happy
mean which the human too-much on both sides was perhaps
necessary to produce. 'The tangle of delusions which stifled
and distorted the growing tree of our well-being has been torn
away; the parasite-weeds that fed on its very roots have been 350
plucked up with a salutary violence. To us there remain only
quiet duties, the constant care, the gradual improvement, the
cautious unhazardous labours of the industrious though
contented gardener&mdash;to prune, to strengthen, to engraft, and one
by one to remove from its leaves and fresh shoots the slug and 355
the caterpillar. But far be it from us to undervalue with light
and senseless detraction the conscientious hardihood of our
predecessors, or even to condemn in them that vehemence, to
which the blessings it won for us leave us now neither
temptation nor pretext. We antedate the feelings, in order to 360
criminate the authors, of our present liberty, light and
toleration.' (The Friend, No. IV. Sept. 7, 1809.) [1818, i. 105.]

If ever two great men might seem, during their whole lives,
to have moved in direct opposition, though neither of them has
at any time introduced the name of the other, Milton and 365
Jeremy Taylor were they. The former commenced his career
by attacking the Church-Liturgy and all set forms of prayer.
The latter, but far more successfully, by defending both.
Milton's next work was against the Prelacy and the then
existing Church-Government&mdash;Taylor's in vindication and 370
support of them. Milton became more and more a stern republican,
or rather an advocate for that religious and moral aristocracy
which, in his day, was called republicanism, and which, even more
than royalism itself, is the direct antipode of modern jacobinism.
Taylor, as more and more sceptical concerning the fitness of 375
men in general for power, became more and more attached to
the prerogatives of monarchy. From Calvinism, with a still
decreasing respect for Fathers, Councils, and for Church-antiquity
in general, Milton seems to have ended in an indifference,
if not a dislike, to all forms of ecclesiastic government, and to 380
have retreated wholly into the inward and spiritual church-communion
of his own spirit with the Light that lighteth every
man that cometh into the world. Taylor, with a growing
reverence for authority, an increasing sense of the insufficiency of
the Scriptures without the aids of tradition and the consent of 385
authorized interpreters, advanced as far in his approaches (not
indeed to Popery, but) to Roman-Catholicism, as a conscientious
minister of the English Church could well venture. Milton
would be and would utter the same to all on all occasions: he
would tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the 390
truth. Taylor would become all things to all men, if by any
[1106]
means he might benefit any; hence he availed himself, in his
popular writings, of opinions and representations which stand
often in striking contrast with the doubts and convictions
expressed in his more philosophical works. He appears, indeed, 395
not too severely to have blamed that management of truth
(istam falsitatem dispensativam) authorized and exemplified by
almost all the fathers: Integrum omnino doctoribus et coetus
Christiani antistitibus esse, ut dolos versent, falsa veris
intermisceant et imprimis religionis hostes fallant, dummodo 400
veritatis commodis et utilitati inserviant.

The same antithesis might be carried on with the elements
of their several intellectual powers. Milton, austere, condensed,
imaginative, supporting his truth by direct enunciation of lofty
moral sentiment and by distinct visual representations, and in 405
the same spirit overwhelming what he deemed falsehood by
moral denunciation and a succession of pictures appalling or
repulsive. In his prose, so many metaphors, so many allegorical
miniatures. Taylor, eminently discursive, accumulative,
and (to use one of his own words) agglomerative; still more 410
rich in images than Milton himself, but images of fancy, and
presented to the common and passive eye, rather than to the
eye of the imagination. Whether supporting or assailing, he
makes his way either by argument or by appeals to the
affections, unsurpassed even by the schoolmen in subtlety, 415
agility, and logic wit, and unrivalled by the most rhetorical of
the fathers in the copiousness and vividness of his expressions
and illustrations. Here words that convey feelings, and words
that flash images, and words of abstract notion, flow together,
and whirl and rush onward like a stream, at once rapid and full 420
of eddies; and yet still interfused here and there we see a tongue
or islet of smooth water, with some picture in it of earth or sky,
landscape or living group of quiet beauty.

Differing then so widely and almost contrariantly, wherein
did these great men agree? wherein did they resemble each 425
other? In genius, in learning, in unfeigned piety, in blameless
purity of life, and in benevolent aspirations and purposes for
the moral and temporal improvement of their fellow-creatures!
Both of them wrote a Latin Accidence, to render education
more easy and less painful to children; both of them composed 430
hymns and psalms proportioned to the capacity of common
congregations; both, nearly at the same time, set the glorious
example of publicly recommending and supporting general
[1107]
toleration, and the liberty both of the Pulpit and the press!
In the writings of neither shall we find a single sentence, like 435
those meek deliverances to God's mercy, with which Laud
accompanied his votes for the mutilations and loathsome
dungeoning of Leighton and others!&mdash;nowhere such a pious prayer
as we find in Bishop Hall's memoranda of his own life, concerning
the subtle and witty atheist that so grievously perplexed 440
and gravelled him at Sir Robert Drury's till he prayed to the
Lord to remove him, and behold! his prayers were heard: for
shortly afterward this Philistine-combatant went to London,
and there perished of the plague in great misery! In short,
nowhere shall we find the least approach, in the lives and 445
writings of John Milton or Jeremy Taylor, to that guarded
gentleness, to that sighing reluctance, with which the holy
brethren of the Inquisition deliver over a condemned heretic
to the civil magistrate, recommending him to mercy, and
hoping that the magistrate will treat the erring brother with 450
all possible mildness!&mdash;the magistrate who too well knows what
would be his own fate if he dared offend them by acting on their
recommendation.

The opportunity of diverting the reader from myself to
characters more worthy of his attention, has led me far beyond my 455
first intention; but it is not unimportant to expose the false
zeal which has occasioned these attacks on our elder patriots.
It has been too much the fashion first to personify the Church
of England, and then to speak of different individuals, who in
different ages have been rulers in that church, as if in some 460
strange way they constituted its personal identity. Why should
a clergyman of the present day feel interested in the defence
of Laud or Sheldon? Surely it is sufficient for the warmest
partisan of our establishment that he can assert with
truth,&mdash;when our Church persecuted, it was on mistaken principles 465
held in common by all Christendom; and at all events, far less
culpable was this intolerance in the Bishops, who were
maintaining the existing laws, than the persecuting spirit afterwards
shewn by their successful opponents, who had no such excuse,
and who should have been taught mercy by their own sufferings, 470
and wisdom by the utter failure of the experiment in their own
case. We can say that our Church, apostolical in its faith,
primitive in its ceremonies, unequalled in its liturgical forms; that
our Church, which has kindled and displayed more bright and
burning lights of genius and learning than all other protestant 475
churches since the reformation, was (with the single exception
of the times of Laud and Sheldon) least intolerant, when all
Christians unhappily deemed a species of intolerance their
religious duty; that Bishops of our church were among the first
that contended against this error; and finally, that since the 480
[1108]
reformation, when tolerance became a fashion, the Church of
England in a tolerating age, has shewn herself eminently
tolerant, and far more so, both in spirit and in fact, than
many of her most bitter opponents, who profess to deem
toleration itself an insult on the rights of mankind! As to 485
myself, who not only know the Church-Establishment to be
tolerant, but who see in it the greatest, if not the sole safe
bulwark of toleration. I feel no necessity of defending or
palliating oppressions under the two Charleses, in order to
exclaim with a full and fervent heart, Esto perpetua! 490



FOOTNOTES:

[1097:1] First published in Sibylline Leaves in 1817:
included in 1828, 1829, and 1834. The 'Apologetic Preface' must have
been put together in 1815, with a view to publication in the volume
afterwards named Sibylline Leaves, but the incident on which it turns
most probably took place in the spring of 1803, when both Scott and
Coleridge were in London. Davy writing to Poole, May 1, 1803, says that
he generally met Coleridge during his stay in town, 'in the midst of
large companies, where he was the image of power and activity,' and
Davy, as we know, was one of Sotheby's guests. In a letter to Mrs.
Fletcher dated Dec. 18, 1830 (?), Scott tells the story in his own
words, but throws no light on date or period. The implied date (1809) in
Morritt's report of Dr. Howley's conversation (Lockhart's Life of
Scott, 1837, ii. 245) is out of the question, as Coleridge did not
leave the Lake Country between Sept. 1808 and October 1810. Coleridge
set great store by 'his own stately account of this lion-show' (ibid.).
In a note in a MS. copy of Sibylline Leaves presented to his son
Derwent he writes:&mdash;'With the exception of this slovenly sentence (ll.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS IN THE COURT
OF LOVE

[Vide ante, p. 409.]


Why is my Love like the Sun?

1. The Dawn = the presentiment of my Love.


No voice as yet had made the air
Be music with thy name: yet why
That obscure [over aching] Hope: that yearning Sigh?
That sense of Promise everywhere?
Beloved! flew thy spirit by?


2. The Sunrise = the suddenness, the all-at-once of Love&mdash;and the first
silence&mdash;the beams of Light fall first on the distance, the interspace
still dark.

3. The Cheerful Morning&mdash;the established Day-light universal.

4. The Sunset&mdash;who can behold it, and think of the Sun-rise? It takes
all the thought to itself. The Moon-reflected Light&mdash;soft, melancholy,
warmthless&mdash;the absolute purity (nay, it is always pure, but), the
incorporeity of Love in absence&mdash;Love per se is a Potassium&mdash;it can
subsist by itself, tho' in presence it has a natural and necessary
combination with the comburent principle. All other Lights (the fixed
Stars) not borrowed from the absent Sun&mdash;Lights for other worlds, not
for me. I see them and admire, but they irradiate nothing.

On the sky with liquid openings of Blue,
The slanting pillar of sun mist,
Field-inward flew a little Bird.
Pois'd himself on the column,
Sang with a sweet and marvellous voice, 5
Adieu! adieu!
I must away, Far, far away,
Set off to-day.

It was so well with me, and yet so strange.

Swell'st thou with joy or smart?
But the Bird went away&mdash;
Adieu! adieu! 15

All cloudy the heavens falling and falling&mdash;
Then said I&mdash;Ah! summer again&mdash;
The swallow, the summer-bird is going,
And so will my Beauty fall like the leaves
From my pining for his absence, 20
And so will his Love fly away.
Away! away!
Like the summer-bird,
Swift as the Day.

But lo! again came the slanting sun-shaft, 25
Close by me pois'd on its wing,
The sweet Bird sang again,
And looking on my tearful Face
Did it not say,
'Love has arisen, 30
True Love makes its summer,
In the Heart'?

Notebook No. 29, p. 168.

21 Feb. 1825.

My Dear Friend

I have often amused myself with the thought of a self-conscious
Looking-glass, and the various metaphorical applications of such a
fancy&mdash;and this morning it struck across the Eolian Harp of my Brain
that there was something pleasing and emblematic (of what I did not
distinctly make out) in two such Looking-glasses fronting, each seeing
the other in itself, and itself in the other. Have you ever noticed the
Vault or snug little Apartment which the Spider spins and weaves for
itself, by spiral threads round and round, and sometimes with strait
lines, so that its lurking parlour or withdrawing-room is an oblong
square? This too connected itself in my mind with the melancholy truth,
that as we grow older, the World (alas! how often it happens that the
less we love it, the more we care for it, the less reason we have to
value its Shews, the more anxious are we about them&mdash;alas! how often do
we become more and more loveless, as Love which can outlive all change
save a change with regard to itself, and all loss save the loss of its
Reflex, is more needed to sooth us and alone is able so to do!) What
was I saying? O, I was adverting to the fact that as we advance in
years, the World, that spidery Witch, spins its threads narrower and
narrower, still closing on us, till at last it shuts us up within four
walls, walls of flues and films, windowless&mdash;and well if there be
sky-lights, and a small opening left for the Light from above. I do not
know that I have anything to add, except to remind you, that [1111]pheer or
phere for Mate, Companion, Counterpart, is a word frequently
used by Spencer (sic) and Herbert, and the Poets generally, who wrote
before the Restoration (1660), before I say that this premature warm and
sunny day, antedating Spring, called forth the following.



Strain in the manner of G. Herbert, which might be entitled The Alone
Most Dear: a Complaint of Jacob to Rachel as in the tenth year of her
service he saw in her or fancied that he saw symptoms of Alienation.
N.B. The Thoughts and Images being modernized and turned into
English.



  &nbsp;
  (It was fancy) [Pencil note by Mrs. Gillman.]
    All Nature seems at work. Snails Slugs leave their lair;
    The Bees are stirring; Birds are on the wing;
    And Winter slumb'ring in the open air
    Wears on his smiling face a dream of Spring.
    And
    But I the while, the sole unbusy thing.
    Nor honey make, nor pair, nor build, nor sing.
    Yet well I ken the banks where[1111:1]Amaranths blow
    Have traced the fount whence Streams of Nectar flow.
    Bloom, O ye Amaranths! bloom for whom ye may&mdash;
    For me ye bloom not! Glide, rich streams! away!
    ? Lip unbrighten'd, wreathless B.
    With unmoist Lip and wreathless Brow I stroll;
    And would you learn the spells that drowse my soul?
    Work without Hope draws nectar in a sieve;
    And Hope without an Object cannot live.

&nbsp;

  &nbsp;
  I speak in figures, inward thoughts and woes
    Interpreting by Shapes and outward shews:

  Where daily nearer me with magic Ties,

  &nbsp;
  Line over line, and thickning as they rise)
    The World her spidery threads on all sides spin
    Side answ'ring side with narrow interspace,
    My Faith (say I; I and my Faith are one)
    Hung, as a Mirror, there! And face to face
    (For nothing else there was between or near)
    One Sister Mirror hid the dreary Wall,


  &nbsp;
  But that is broke! And with that
  
    
      
        &nbsp;
          &nbsp;

    Faith in the Faith of The Alone Most Dear!



Jacob Hodiernus.

Ah! me!!


Call the World spider: and at fancy's touch
Thought becomes image and I see it such.
With viscous masonry of films and threads
Tough as the nets in Indian Forests found
It blends the Waller's and the Weaver's trades
And soon the tent-like Hangings touch the ground
A dusky chamber that excludes the day
But cease the prelude and resume the lay

Note to Line 34 of the Joan of Arc Book II. 1796, pp. 41, 42.

Line 34. Sir Isaac Newton at the end of the last edition of his Optics
supposes that a very subtile and elastic fluid, which he calls aether,
is diffused thro' the pores of gross bodies, as well as thro' the open
spaces that are void of gross matter: he supposes it to pierce all
bodies, and to touch their least particles, acting on them with a force
proportional to their number or to the matter of the body on which it
acts. He supposes likewise, that it is rarer in the pores of bodies than
in open spaces, and even rarer in small pores and dense bodies, than in
large pores and rare bodies; and also that its density increases in
receding from gross matter; so for instance as to be greater at the
1/100 of an inch from the surface of any body, than at its surface; and
so on. To the action of this aether he ascribes the attractions of
gravitation and coh&oelig;sion, the attraction and repulsion of electrical
bodies, the mutual influences of bodies and light upon each other, the
effects and communication of heat, and the performance of animal
sensation and motion. David Hartley, from whom this account of aether is
chiefly borrowed, makes it the instrument of propagating those
vibrations or configurative motions which are ideas. It appears to me,
no hypothesis ever involved so many contradictions; for how can the same
fluid be both dense and rare in the same body at one time? Yet in the
Earth as gravitating to the Moon, it must be very rare; and in the Earth
as gravitating to the Sun, it must be very dense. For as Andrew Baxter
well observes, it doth not appear sufficient to account how the fluid
may act with a force proportional to the body to which another is
impelled, to assert that it is rarer in great bodies than in small ones;
it must be further asserted that this fluid is rarer or denser in the
same body, whether small or great, according as the body to which that
is impelled is itself small or great. But whatever may be the solidity
of this objection, the following seems unanswerable:

If every particle thro' the whole solidity of a heavy body receive its
impulse from the particles of this fluid, it should seem that the fluid
itself must be as dense as the very densest heavy body, gold for
instance; there being as many impinging particles in the one, as there
are gravitating particles in the other which receive their gravitation
by being impinged upon: so that, throwing gold or any heavy body upward,
against the impulse of this fluid, would be like throwing gold thro'
gold; and as this aether must be equally diffused over the whole sphere
of its activity, it must be as dense when it impels cork as when it
impels gold, so that to throw a piece of cork upward, would be as if we
endeavoured to make cork penetrate a medium as dense as gold; and tho'
we were to adopt the extravagant opinions which have been advanced
concerning the progression of pores, yet however porous we suppose a
body, if it be not all pore, the argument holds equally, the fluid must
be as dense as the body in order to give every particle its impulse.

It has been asserted that Sir Isaac Newton's philosophy leads in its
consequences to Atheism: perhaps not without reason. For if matter, by
any powers or properties given to it, can produce the order of the
visible world and even generate thought; why may it not have possessed
such properties by inherent right? and where is the necessity of a
God? matter is according to the mechanic philosophy capable of acting
most wisely and most beneficently without Wisdom or [1113]Benevolence; and
what more does the Atheist assert? if matter possess those properties,
why might it not have possessed them from all eternity? Sir Isaac
Newton's Deity seems to be alternately operose and indolent; to have
delegated so much power as to make it inconceivable what he can have
reserved. He is dethroned by Vice-regent second causes.

We seem placed here to acquire a knowledge of effects. Whenever we
would pierce into the Adyta of Causation, we bewilder ourselves; and
all that laborious Conjecture can do, is to fill up the gaps of
imagination. We are restless, because invisible things are not the
objects of vision&mdash;and philosophical systems, for the most part, are
received not for their Truth, but in proportion as they attribute to
Causes a susceptibility of being seen, whenever our visual organs
shall have become sufficiently powerful.

DEDICATION[1113:1]

Ode on the Departing Year, 1796, pp. [3]-4.

[Vide ante, p. 160.]


To Thomas Poole, of Stowey.

My Dear Friend&mdash;

Soon after the commencement of this month, the Editor of the Cambridge
Intelligencer (a newspaper conducted with so much ability, and such
unmixed and fearless zeal for the interests of Piety and Freedom, that I
cannot but think my poetry honoured by being permitted to appear in it)
requested me, by Letter, to furnish him with some Lines for the last day
of this Year. I promised him that I would make the attempt; but almost
immediately after, a rheumatic complaint seized on my head, and
continued to prevent the possibility of poetic composition till within
the last three days. So in the course of the last three days the
following Ode was produced. In general, when an Author informs the
Public that his production was struck off in a great hurry, he offers an
insult, not an excuse. But I trust that the present case is an
exception, and that the peculiar circumstances which obliged me to write
with such unusual rapidity give a propriety to my professions of it:
nec nunc eam apud te jacto, sed et ceteris indico; ne quis asperiore
lim&acirc; carmen examinet, et a confuso scriptum et quod frigidum erat ni
statim traderem.[1113:2] (I avail myself of the words of Statius, and
hope that I shall likewise be able to say of any weightier publication,
what he has declared of his Thebaid, that it had been tortured[1113:3]
with a laborious Polish.)

For me to discuss the literary merits of this hasty composition were
idle and presumptuous. If it be found to possess that impetuosity of
Transition, and that Precipitation of Fancy and Feeling, which are [1114]the
essential excellencies of the sublimer Ode, its deficiency in less
important respects will be easily pardoned by those from whom alone
praise could give me pleasure: and whose minuter criticisms will be
disarmed by the reflection, that these Lines were conceived 'not in the
soft obscurities of Retirement, or under the Shelter of Academic Groves,
but amidst inconvenience and distraction, in sickness and in
sorrow'.[1114:1] I am more anxious lest the moral spirit of the Ode
should be mistaken. You, I am sure, will not fail to recollect that
among the Ancients, the Bard and the Prophet were one and the same
character; and you know, that although I prophesy curses, I pray
fervently for blessings. Farewell, Brother of my Soul!


&mdash;&mdash;O ever found the same,
And trusted and belov'd![1114:2]


Never without an emotion of honest pride do I subscribe myself

Your grateful and affectionate friend,
S. T. Coleridge.

Bristol, December 26, 1796.

Preface to the MS. of Osorio.

[Vide ante, p. 519.]


In this sketch of a tragedy, all is imperfect, and much obscure. Among
other equally great defects (millstones round the slender neck of its
merits) it presupposes a long story; and this long story, which yet is
necessary to the complete understanding of the play, is not half told.
Albert had sent a letter informing his family that he should arrive
about such a time by ship; he was shipwrecked; and wrote a private
letter to Osorio, informing him alone of this accident, that he might
not shock Maria. Osorio destroyed the letter, and sent assassins to meet
Albert.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Worse than all, the growth of Osorio's character is nowhere
explained&mdash;and yet I had most clear and psychologically accurate ideas
of the whole of it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A man, who from constitutional calmness of
appetites, is seduced into pride and the love of power, by these into
misanthropism, or rather a contempt of mankind, and from thence, by the
co-operation of envy, and a curiously modified love for a beautiful
female (which is nowhere developed in the play), into a most atrocious
guilt. A man who is in truth a weak man, yet always duping himself into
the belief that he has a soul of iron. Such were some of my leading
ideas.

In short the thing is but an embryo, and whilst it remains in
manuscript, which it is destined to do, the critic would judge unjustly
who should call it a miscarriage. It furnished me with a most important
lesson, namely, that to have conceived strongly, does not always imply
the power of successful execution. S. T. C.

APPENDIX V

ADAPTATIONS

For a critical study of Coleridge's alterations in the text of the
quotations from seventeenth-century poets, which were inserted in the
Biographia Literaria (2 vols., 1817), or were prefixed as mottoes to
Chapters in the rifacimento of The Friend (3 vols., 1818), see an
article by J. D Campbell entitled 'Coleridge's Quotations,' which was
published in the Athen&aelig;um, August 20, 1892, and 'Adaptations', P.
W., 1893, pp. 471-4. Most of these textual alterations or garblings
were noted by H. N. Coleridge in an edition of The Friend published in
1837; Mr. Campbell was the first to collect and include the mottoes and
quotations in a sub-section of Coleridge's Poetical Works. Three poems,
(1) 'An Elegy Imitated from Akenside', (2) 'Farewell to Love ', (3)
'Mutual Passion altered and modernized from an Old Poet', may be
reckoned as 'Adaptations'. The first and third of these composite
productions lay no claim to originality, whilst the second, 'Farewell to
Love', which he published anonymously in The Courier, September 27,
1806, was not included by Coleridge in Sibylline Leaves, or in 1828,
1829, 1834. For (1) vide ante, p. 69, and post, Read:&mdash;p. 1123;

SIR JOHN DAVIES

On the Immortality of the Soul

(Sect. iv. Stanzas 12-14.)


Doubtless, this could not be, but that she turns
Bodies to spirits, by sublimation strange;
As fire converts to fire the things it burns;
As we our meats into our nature change.


[1117]


From their gross matter she abstracts the forms, 5
And draws a kind of quintessence from things;
Which to her proper nature she transforms,
To bear them light, on her celestial wings.

This doth she, when, from things particular,
She doth abstract the universal kinds, 10
Which bodiless and immaterial are,
And can be only lodg'd within our minds.

Stanza 13, l. 1 From their gross matter she abstracts their forms.

Thus doth she, when from individual states
She doth abstract the universal kinds;

DONNE

Eclogue. 'On Unworthy Wisdom'


So reclused Hermits oftentimes do know
More of Heaven's glory than a worldly can:
As Man is of the World, the Heart of Man
Is an Epitome of God's great Book
Of Creatures, and Men need no further look.


These lines are quoted by Coleridge in The Friend, 1818, i. 192; 1850,
i. 147. The first two lines run thus:


The recluse Hermit oft' times more doth know
Of the world's inmost wheels, than worldlings can, &amp;c.


The alteration was first pointed out in an edition of The Friend
issued by H. N. Coleridge in 1837.

Letter To Sir Henry Goodyere

Stanzas II, III, IV, and a few words from Stanza V, are prefixed as the
motto to Essay XV of The Friend, 1818, i. 179; 1850, i. 136.

For Stanza II, line 3&mdash;


But he which dwells there is not so; for he
With him who dwells there 'tis not so; for he


For Stanza III&mdash;


So had your body her morning, hath her noon,
And shall not better, her next change is night:
But her fair larger guest, t'whom sun and moon
Are sparks, and short liv'd, claims another right.&mdash;


The motto reads:


Our bodies had their morning, have their noon,
And shall not better&mdash;the next change is night,
But their fair larger guest, t'whom sun and moon
Are sparks and short liv'd, claims another right.


The alteration was first noted in 1837. In 1850 line 3 of Stanza III
'fair' is misprinted 'far'.

BEN JONSON

A Nymph's Passion


I love, and he loves me again,
Yet dare I not tell who;
For if the nymphs should know my swain,
I fear they'd love him too;
Yet if it be not known, 5
The pleasure is as good as none,
For that's a narrow joy is but our own.

I'll tell, that if they be not glad,
They yet may envy me;
But then if I grow jealous mad, 10
And of them pitied be,
It were a plague 'bove scorn,
And yet it cannot be forborne,
Unless my heart would, as my thought, be torn.

He is, if they can find him, fair, 15
And fresh and fragrant too,
As summer's sky or purged air,
And looks as lilies do
That are this morning blown;
Yet, yet I doubt he is not known, 20
And fear much more, that more of him be shown.

But he hath eyes so round and bright,
As make away my doubt,
Where Love may all his torches light
Though hate had put them out; 25
But then, t'increase my fears,
What nymph soe'er his voice but hears,
Will be my rival, though she have but ears.

I'll tell no more, and yet I love,
And he loves me; yet no 30
One unbecoming thought doth move
From either heart, I know;
But so exempt from blame,
As it would be to each a fame,
If love or fear would let me tell his name. 35

Mutual Passion

Altered and Modernized From an Old Poet


I love, and he loves me again,
Yet dare I not tell who:
For if the nymphs should know my swain,
I fear they'd love him too.
Yet while my joy's unknown, 5
Its rosy buds are but half-blown:
What no one with me shares, seems scarce my own.


[1119]


I'll tell, that if they be not glad,
They yet may envy me:
But then if I grow jealous mad, 10
And of them pitied be,
'Twould vex me worse than scorn!
And yet it cannot be forborn,
Unless my heart would like my thoughts be torn.

He is, if they can find him, fair 15
And fresh, and fragrant too;
As after rain the summer air,
And looks as lilies do,
That are this morning blown!
Yet, yet I doubt, he is not known, 20
Yet, yet I fear to have him fully shewn.

But he hath eyes so large, and bright.
Which none can see, and doubt
That Love might thence his torches light
Tho' Hate had put them out! 25
But then to raise my fears,
His voice&mdash;what maid so ever hears
Will be my rival, tho' she have but ears.

I'll tell no more! yet I love him,
And ho loves me; yet so, 30
That never one low wish did dim
Our love's pure light, I know&mdash;
In each so free from blame,
That both of us would gain new fame,
If love's strong fears would let me tell his name! 35

Consider this small dust, here in the glass
By atoms moved:
Could you believe that this the body was
Of one that loved;
And in his mistress' flame playing like a fly, 5
Was turned to cinders by her eye:
Yes; and in death, as life unblest,
To have 't exprest,
Even ashes of lovers find no rest.

O think, fair maid! these sands that pass
In slender threads adown this glass,

That not in life alone unblest
E'en lovers' ashes find no rest.

O my Tibullus,
Let us not blame him; for against such chances
The heartiest strife of virtue is not proof.
We may read constancy and fortitude
To other souls; but had ourselves been struck 5
With the like planet, had our loves, like his,
Been ravished from us by injurious death,
And in the height and heat of our best days,
It would have cracked our sinews, shrunk our veins,
And made our very heart-strings jar like his. 10

And shall with those alive so sympathize,
As nourish'd with stern powers, enjoy their parts.

O blessed letters! that combine in one
All ages past, and make one live with all:
By you we do confer with who are gone,
And the dead-living unto council call:
By you the unborn shall have communion
Of what we feel, and what does us befall.

Since Writings are the Veins, the Arteries,

THE NATIVITY OR CHRISTMAS DAY.


Unfold thy face, unmask thy ray,
Shine forth, bright sun, double the day;
Let no malignant misty fume
Nor foggy vapour, once presume
To interpose thy perfect sights, 5
This day which makes us use thy lights
For ever better that we could
That blessed object once behold,
Which is both the circumference
And centre of all excellence, &amp;c. 10

Substitute the following for the fifth to the eighth line.


To sheath or blunt one happy ray,
That wins new splendour from the day,&mdash;
This day that gives thee power to rise,
And shine on hearts as well as eyes:
This birth-day of all souls, when first
On eyes of flesh and blood did burst
That primal great lucific light,
That rays to thee, to us gave sight.

[For Elegy Imitated from one of Akenside's 'Blank Verse Inscriptions',

Whoe'er thou art whose path in Summer lies
Through yonder village, turn thee where the Grove
Of branching oaks a rural palace old
Embosoms&mdash;there dwells Albert, generous lord
Of all the harvest round. And onward thence 5
A low plain chapel fronts the morning light
Fast by a silent rivulet. Humbly walk,
O stranger, o'er the consecrated ground;
And on that verdant Hillock, which thou seest
Beset with osiers, let thy pious hand 10
Sprinkle fresh water from the brook, and strew
Sweet-smelling flowers&mdash;for there doth Edmund rest,
The learned shepherd; for each rural art
Famed, and for songs harmonious, and the woes
Of ill-requited love. The faithless pride 15
Of fair Matilda sank him to the grave
In manhood's prime. But soon did righteous Heaven
With tears, with sharp remorse, and pining care
Avenge her falsehood. Nor could all the gold
And nuptial pomp, which lured her plighted faith 20
From Edmund to a loftier husband's home,
Relieve her breaking heart, or turn aside
The strokes of death. Go, traveller, relate
The mournful story. Haply some fair maid
May hold it in remembrance, and be taught 25
That riches cannot pay for truth or love.

W. L. BOWLES


&mdash;&mdash;I yet remain
To mourn the hours of youth (yet mourn in vain)
That fled neglected: wisely thou hast trod
The better path&mdash;and that high meed which God
Assign'd to virtue, tow'ring from the dust, 5
Shall wait thy rising, Spirit pure and just!

O God! how sweet it were to think, that all
Who silent mourn around this gloomy ball
Might hear the voice of joy;&mdash;but 'tis the will
Of man's great Author, that thro' good and ill 10
Calm he should hold his course, and so sustain
His varied lot of pleasure, toil and pain!


1793

['These lines,' which 'were found in Mr. Coleridge's handwriting in one
of the Prayer Books in the Chapel of Jesus College, Cambridge,' were
first published in Lit. Rem., 1836, i. 34. They were first collected
in P. W., 1885, i. 127. The first six lines are (see P. W., 1893, p.
474) taken from Bowles's elegy 'On the Death of Henry Headley'. J. D.
Campbell surmised that the last six lines 'practically belonged to the
same poem', but of this there is no evidence. The note of the elegy is a
lament for the 'untimely sorrow' which had befallen an innocent
sufferer, and the additional lines, which Coleridge composed or quoted,
moralized the theme.

Note. Bowles wrote, I, alas, remain (l. 1), and 'Ordain'd for virtue'
(l. 5).]

NAPOLEON


Then we may thank ourselves,
Who spell-bound by the magic name of Peace
Dream golden dreams. Go, warlike Britain, go,
For the grey olive-branch change thy green laurels:
Hang up thy rusty helmet, that the bee 5
May have a hive, or spider find a loom!
Instead of doubling drum and thrilling fife
Be lull'd in lady's lap with amorous flutes:
But for Napoleon, know, he'll scorn this calm:
The ruddy planet at his birth bore sway, 10
Sanguine adust his humour, and wild fire
His ruling element. Rage, revenge, and cunning
Make up the temper of this Captain's valour.

First published in The Friend, 1818, ii. 115. In later editions the
word 'Adapted' was omitted. First collected in 1893.

J. D. Campbell (P. W., 1893, p. 473) suggests that the 'calm' was,
probably, the 'Peace of Amiens'.

Zwischen Mirten zum Tempelhain emporwand.
Dort im Rosengeb&uuml;sch, der Huldg&ouml;ttinnen 10

Eine Priesterin, reizend wie Apelles
Seine Grazien malt, zum Sohn Cytherens,

Und durch Wogen und Dunkel ihn zu leiten, 15

Im Felsennacken freien Sinn, 15

Freudig begr&uuml;ssten die Fluthen des Meeres neuer Bewohner
Mannigfaltige Schaaren; es staunte der werdende Wallfisch
Ueber die steigenden Str&ouml;me die seiner Nasen entbrausten;
Junges Leben durchbr&uuml;llte die Auen, die W&auml;lder, die Berge,
Irrte bl&ouml;kend im Thal, und sang in bl&uuml;henden Stauden. 25

PREFACE

Poems on various subjects written at different times and prompted by
very different feelings; but which will be read at one time and under
the influence of one set of feelings&mdash;this is an heavy disadvantage: for
we love or admire a poet in proportion as he developes our own
sentiments and emotions, or reminds us of our own knowledge.

Compositions resembling those of the present volume are not unfrequently
condemned for their querulous egotism. But egotism is to be [1136]condemned
then only when it offends against time and place, as in an History or an
Epic Poem. To censure it in a Monody or Sonnet is almost as absurd as to
dislike a circle for being round. Why then write Sonnets or Monodies?
Because they give me pleasure when perhaps nothing else could. After the
more violent emotions of Sorrow, the mind demands solace and can find it
in employment alone; but full of its late sufferings it can endure no
employment not connected with those sufferings. Forcibly to turn away
our attention to other subjects is a painful and in general an
unavailing effort.


"But O how grateful to a wounded heart
The tale of misery to impart;
From others' eyes bid artless sorrows flow
And raise esteem upon the base of woe!"[1136:1]


The communicativeness of our nature leads us to describe our own
sorrows; in the endeavor to describe them intellectual activity is
exerted; and by a benevolent law of our nature from intellectual
activity a pleasure results which is gradually associated and mingles as
a corrective with the painful subject of the description. True! it may
be answered, but how are the Public interested in your sorrows or your
description? We are for ever attributing a personal unity to imaginary
aggregates. What is the Public but a term for a number of scattered
individuals of whom as many will be interested in these sorrows as have
experienced the same or similar?


"Holy be the Lay,
Which mourning soothes the mourner on his way!"


There is one species of egotism which is truly disgusting; not that
which leads us to communicate our feelings to others, but that which
would reduce the feelings of others to an identity with our own. The
Atheist, who exclaims "pshaw!" when he glances his eye on the praises of
Deity, is an Egotist; an old man, when he speaks contemptuously of
love-verses, is an Egotist; and your sleek favourites of Fortune are
Egotists, when they condemn all "melancholy discontented" verses.

Surely it would be candid not merely to ask whether the Poem pleases
ourselves, but to consider whether or no there may not be others to whom
it is well-calculated to give an innocent pleasure. With what anxiety
every fashionable author avoids the word I!&mdash;now he transforms himself
into a third person,&mdash;"the present writer"&mdash;now multiplies himself and
swells into "we"&mdash;and all this is the watchfulness of guilt. Conscious
that this said I is perpetually intruding on his mind and that it
monopolizes his heart, he is prudishly solicitous that it may not escape
from his lips.

This disinterestedness of phrase is in general commensurate with
selfishness of feeling: men old and hackneyed in the ways of the world
are scrupulous avoiders of Egotism.

Of the following Poems a considerable number are styled "Effusions," in
defiance of Churchill's line


"Effusion on Effusion pour away."[1136:2]


[1137]I could recollect no title more descriptive of the manner and matter of
the Poems&mdash;I might indeed have called the majority of them Sonnets&mdash;but
they do not possess that oneness of thought which I deem indispensible
(sic) in a Sonnet&mdash;and (not a very honorable motive perhaps) I was
fearful that the title "Sonnet" might have reminded my reader of the
Poems of the Rev. W. L. Bowles&mdash;a comparison with whom would have sunk
me below that mediocrity, on the surface of which I am at present
enabled to float.

Some of the verses allude to an intended emigration to America on the
scheme of an abandonment of individual property.

The Effusions signed C. L. were written by Mr. Charles Lamb, of the
India House&mdash;independently of the signature their superior merit would
have sufficiently distinguished them. For the rough sketch of Effusion
XVI, I am indebted to Mr. Favell. And the first half of Effusion XV was
written by the Author of "Joan of Arc", an Epic Poem.


Notes attached to a first draft of the Preface to the First Edition
[MS. R]

(i)

I cannot conclude the Preface without expressing my grateful
acknowledgments to Mr. Cottle, Bristol, for the liberality with which
(with little probability I know of remuneration from the sale) he
purchased the poems, and the typographical elegance by which he
endeavoured to recommend them, (or)&mdash;the liberal assistance which he
afforded me, by the purchase of the copyright with little probability of
remuneration from the sale of the Poems.

[This acknowledgement, which was omitted from the Preface to the First
Edition, was rewritten and included in the 'Advertisement' to the
'Supplement' to the Second Edition.]

(ii)

To Earl Stanhope

A man beloved of Science and of Freedom, these Poems are
respectfully inscribed by
The Author.

[In a letter to Miss Cruikshank (? 1807) (Early Recollections, 1837,
i. 201), Coleridge maintains that the 'Sonnet to Earl Stanhope', which
was published in Poems, 1796 (vide ante, pp. 89, 90), 'was inserted
by the fool of a publisher [Cottle prints 'inserted by Biggs, the fool
of a printer'] in order, forsooth, that he might send the book and a
letter to Earl Stanhope; who (to prove that he is not mad in all
things) treated both book and letter with silent contempt.' In a note
Cottle denies this statement, and maintains that the 'book (handsomely
bound) and the letter were sent to Lord S. by Mr. C. himself'. It is
possible that before the book was published Coleridge had repented of
Sonnet, Dedication, and Letter, and that the 'handsomely bound' volume
was sent by Cottle and not by Coleridge, but the 'Dedication' is in his
own handwriting and proves that he was, in the first instance at least,
particeps criminis. See Note by J. D. Campbell, P. W., 1893, pp.
575, 576.]

Contents.&mdash;


[INTRODUCTION]

The composition of the Sonnet has been regulated by Boileau in his Art
of Poetry, and since Boileau, by William Preston, in the elegant preface
to his Amatory Poems: the rules, which they would establish, are founded
on the practice of Petrarch. I have never yet been able to discover either
sense, nature, or poetic fancy in Petrarch's poems; they appear to me all 5
one cold glitter of heavy conceits and metaphysical abstractions.
However, Petrarch, although not the inventor of the Sonnet, was the first
who made it popular; and his countrymen have taken his poems as the
model. Charlotte Smith and Bowles are they who first made the Sonnet
popular among the present English: I am justified therefore by analogy 10
in deducing its laws from their compositions.

The Sonnet then is a small poem, in which some lonely feeling is
developed. It is limited to a particular number of lines, in order that the
reader's mind having expected the close at the place in which he finds it,
may rest satisfied; and that so the poem may acquire, as it were, a Totality,&mdash;in 15
plainer phrase, may become a Whole. It is confined to fourteen lines,
because as some particular number is necessary, and that particular
number must be a small one, it may as well be fourteen as any other
number. When no reason can be adduced against a thing, Custom is a
sufficient reason for it. Perhaps, if the Sonnet were comprized in less 20
than fourteen lines, it would become a serious Epigram; if it extended to
more, it would encroach on the province of the Elegy. Poems, in which
no lonely feeling is developed, are not Sonnets because the Author has
chosen to write them in fourteen lines; they should rather be entitled
Odes, or Songs, or Inscriptions. The greater part of Warton's Sonnets are 25
severe and masterly likenesses of the style of the Greek &#949;&#960;&#953;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;.

In a Sonnet then we require a developement of some lonely feeling, by
whatever cause it may have been excited; but those Sonnets appear to me
the most exquisite, in which moral Sentiments, Affections, or Feelings,
are deduced from, and associated with, the scenery of Nature. Such 30
compositions generate a habit of thought highly favourable to delicacy of
character. They create a sweet and indissoluble union between the
intellectual and the material world. Easily remembered from their briefness,
and interesting alike to the eye and the affections, these are the poems
which we can "lay up in our heart, and our soul," and repeat them "when 35
we walk by the way, and when we lie down, and when we rise up".
Hence the Sonnets of Bowles derive their marked superiority over all
other Sonnets; hence they domesticate with the heart, and become, as it
were, a part of our identity.

Respecting the metre of a Sonnet, the Writer should consult his own 40
convenience.&mdash;Rhymes, many or few, or no rhymes at all&mdash;whatever the
chastity of his ear may prefer, whatever the rapid expression of his
feelings [1140]will permit;&mdash;all these things are left at his own disposal. A
sameness in the final sound of its words is the great and grievous defect of the
Italian language. That rule, therefore, which the Italians have 45
established, of exactly four different sounds in the Sonnet, seems to have arisen
from their wish to have as many, not from any dread of finding more. But
surely it is ridiculous to make the defect of a foreign language a reason for
our not availing ourselves of one of the marked excellencies of our own.
"The Sonnet (says Preston,) will ever be cultivated by those who write on 50
tender, pathetic subjects. It is peculiarly adapted to the state of a man
violently agitated by a real passion, and wanting composure and vigor of
mind to methodize his thought. It is fitted to express a momentary burst
of Passion" etc. Now, if there be one species of composition more difficult
and artificial than another, it is an English Sonnet on the Italian Model. 55
Adapted to the agitations of a real passion! Express momentary bursts
of feeling in it! I should sooner expect to write pathetic Axes or pour
forth Extempore Eggs and Altars![1140:1] But the best confutation of such idle rules
is to be found in the Sonnets of those who have observed them, in their
inverted sentences, their quaint phrases, and incongruous mixture of 60
obsolete and Spenserian words: and when, at last, the thing is toiled and
hammered into fit shape, it is in general racked and tortured Prose rather
than any thing resembling Poetry. Miss Seward, who has perhaps
succeeded the best in these laborious trifles and who most dogmatically
insists on what she calls "the sonnet-claim," has written a very 65
ingenious although unintentional burlesque on her own system, in the
following lines prefixed to the Poems of a Mr. Carey.


"Prais'd be the Poet, who the sonnet-claim,
Severest of the orders that belong
Distinct and separate to the Delphic song 70
Shall reverence, nor its appropriate name
Lawless assume: peculiar is its frame&mdash;
From him derived, who spurn'd the city throng,
And warbled sweet the rocks and woods among,
Lonely Valclusa! and that heir of Fame, 75
Our greater Milton, hath in many a lay
Woven on this arduous model, clearly shewn
That English verse may happily display
Those strict energic measures which alone
Deserve the name of Sonnet, and convey 80
A spirit, force, and grandeur, all their own!


"Anne Seward."

[Carolus Utenhovius (Utenhove, or Uyttenhove) and Ptolom&oelig;us Luxius
Tasteus were scholar friends of the Scottish poet and historian George
Buchanan (1506-1582), who prefixes some Iambics 'Carolo Utenhovio F. S.'
to his Hexameters 'Franciscanus et Fratres'. In some Elegiacs addressed
to Tasteus and Tevius, in which he complains of his sufferings from gout
and kindred maladies, he tells them that Groscollius (Professor of
Medicine at the University of Paris) was doctoring him with herbs and by
suggestion:&mdash;'Et spe languentem consilioque juvat'. Hence the three
names. In another set of Iambics entitled 'Mutuus Amor' in which he
celebrates the alliance between Scotland and England he writes:&mdash;


Non mortis hoc propinquitas
Non temporis longinquitas
Solvet, fides quod nexuit
Intaminata vinculum.


Hence the wording of the motto. Groscollius is, of course, a mot &agrave;
double entente. It is a name and a nickname. The interpretation of the
names and the reference to Buchanan's Hexameters were first pointed out
by Mr. T. Hutchinson in the Athenaeum, Dec. 10, 1898.]

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION

[Pp. [xiii]-xvi.]

Compositions resembling those of the present volume are not
unfrequently condemned for their querulous Egotism. But Egotism is to be
condemned then only when it offends against Time and Place, as in an
History or an Epic Poem. To censure it in a Monody or Sonnet is almost
as absurd as to dislike a circle for being round. Why then write Sonnets 5
or Monodies? Because they give me pleasure when perhaps nothing else
could. After the more violent emotions of Sorrow, the mind demands
amusement, and can find it in employment alone; but full of its late
sufferings, it can endure no employment not in some measure connected
with them. Forcibly to turn away our attention to general subjects is 10
a painful and most often an unavailing effort:


But O! how grateful to a wounded heart
The tale of Misery to impart&mdash;
From others' eyes bid artless sorrows flow,
And raise esteem upon the base of woe! 15

Shaw.

The communicativeness of our Nature leads us to describe our own
sorrows; in the endeavour to describe them, intellectual activity is exerted;
and from intellectual activity there results a pleasure, which is gradually
associated, and mingles as a corrective, with the painful subject of the 20
description. "True!" (it may be answered) "but how are the Public
interested in your Sorrows or your Description?" We are for ever
attributing personal Unities to imaginary Aggregates.&mdash;What is the Public,
but a term for a number of scattered Individuals? Of whom as many
will be interested in these sorrows, as have experienced the same or 25
similar.


"Holy be the lay,
Which mourning soothes the mourner on his way."


If I could judge of others by myself, I should not hesitate to affirm, that
the most interesting passages in our most interesting Poems are those, in 30
which the Author developes his own feelings. The sweet voice of Cona[1144:1]
never sounds so sweetly as when it speaks of itself; and I should almost
suspect that man of an unkindly heart, who could read the opening of the
third book of the Paradise Lost without peculiar emotion. By a law of
our Nature, he, who labours under a strong feeling, is impelled to seek for 35
sympathy; but a Poet's feelings are all strong. Quicquid amet valde amat.
Akenside therefore speaks with philosophical accuracy, when he classes
Love and Poetry, as producing the same effects:


"Love and the wish of Poets when their tongue
Would teach to others' bosoms, what so charms 40
Their own."&mdash;Pleasures Of Imagination.


There is one species of Egotism which is truly disgusting; not that
which leads us to communicate our feelings to others, but that which
[1145]would reduce the feelings of others to an identity with our own. The
Atheist, who exclaims, "pshaw!" when he glances his eye on the praises 45
of Deity, is an Egotist: an old man, when he speaks contemptuously of
Love-verses is an Egotist: and the sleek Favorites of Fortune are
Egotists, when they condemn all "melancholy, discontented" verses.
Surely, it would be candid not merely to ask whether the poem pleases
ourselves but to consider whether or no there may not be others to whom 50
it is well-calculated to give an innocent pleasure.

I shall only add that each of my readers will, I hope, remember that
these Poems on various subjects, which he reads at one time and under
the influence of one set of feelings, were written at different times and
prompted by very different feelings; and therefore that the supposed 55
inferiority of one Poem to another may sometimes be owing to the temper
of mind, in which he happens to peruse it.


[Pp. [xvii]-xx.]

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION

I return my acknowledgments to the different Reviewers for the
assistance, which they have afforded me, in detecting my poetic deficiencies.
I have endeavoured to avail myself of their remarks: one third of
the former Volume I have omitted, and the imperfections of the republished
part must be considered as errors of taste, not faults of carelessness. My 5
poems have been rightly charged with a profusion of double-epithets, and
a general turgidness. I have pruned the double-epithets with no sparing
hand; and used my best efforts to tame the swell and glitter both of
thought and diction. This latter fault however had insinuated itself
into my Religious Musings with such intricacy of union, that sometimes 10
I have omitted to disentangle the weed from the fear of snapping the
flower. A third and heavier accusation has been brought against me, that
of obscurity; but not, I think, with equal justice. An Author is obscure
when his conceptions are dim and imperfect, and his language incorrect,
or unappropriate, or involved. A poem that abounds in allusions, 15
like the Bard of Gray, or one that impersonates high and abstract
truths, like Collins's Ode on the poetical character, claims not to be
popular&mdash;but should be acquitted of obscurity. The deficiency is in the
Reader. But this is a charge which every poet, whose imagination is
warm and rapid, must expect from his contemporaries. Milton did not 20
escape it; and it was adduced with virulence against Gray and Collins.
We now hear no more of it; not that their poems are better understood
at present, than they were at their first publication; but their fame is
established; and a critic would accuse himself of frigidity or inattention,
who should profess not to understand them. But a living writer is yet 25
sub judice; and if we cannot follow his conceptions or enter into his
feelings, it is more consoling to our pride to consider him as lost beneath,
than as soaring above, us. If any man expect from my poems the same
easiness of style which he admires in a drinking-song, for him I have not
written. Intelligibilia, non intellectum adfero. 30

I expect neither profit nor general fame by my writings; and I consider
myself as having been amply repayed without either. Poetry has been to
[1146]me its own[1146:1] "exceeding great reward": it has soothed my afflictions: it
has multiplied and refined my enjoyments; it has endeared solitude;
and it has given me the habit of wishing to discover the Good and the 35
Beautiful in all that meets and surrounds me.

There were inserted in my former Edition, a few Sonnets of my Friend
and old School-fellow, Charles Lamb. He has now communicated to me
a complete Collection of all his Poems; quae qui non prorsus amet, illum
omnes et Virtutes et Veneres odere. My friend Charles Lloyd has 40
likewise joined me; and has contributed every poem of his, which he
deemed worthy of preservation. With respect to my own share of the
Volume, I have omitted a third of the former Edition, and added almost
an equal number. The Poems thus added are marked in the Contents by
Italics. 45

INTRODUCTION TO THE SONNETS

For lines 1-63 vide ante, No. III, The Introduction to the 'Sheet of
Sonnets'. Lines 64 to the end are omitted, and the last paragraph runs
thus:

The Sonnet has been ever a favourite species of composition with me; but
I am conscious that I have not succeeded in it. From a large number [1147]I
have retained ten only, as seemed not beneath mediocrity. Whatever more
is said of them, ponamus lucro.

S. T. Coleridge.

[Note. In a copy of the Edition of 1797, now in the Rowfant Library,
S. T. C. comments in a marginal note on the words 'I have never yet been
able to discover sense, nature, or poetic fancy in Petrarch's poems,'
&amp;c.&mdash;'A piece of petulant presumption, of which I should be more ashamed
if I did not flatter myself that it stands alone in my writings. The
best of the joke is that at the time I wrote it, I did not understand a
word of Italian, and could therefore judge of this divine Poet only by
bald translations of some half-dozen of his Sonnets.']


[Pp. 243-245.]

ADVERTISEMENT

I have excepted the following Poems from those, which I had determined
to omit. Some intelligent friends particularly requested it, observing,
that what most delighted me when I was "young in writing poetry, would
probably best please those who are young in reading poetry: and a man
must learn to be pleased with a subject, before he can yield that
attention to it, which is requisite in order to acquire a just taste." I
however was fully convinced, that he, who gives to the press what he
does not thoroughly approve in his own closet, commits an act of
disrespect, both against himself and his fellow-citizens. The request
and the reasoning would not, therefore, have influenced me, had they not
been assisted by other motives. The first in order of these verses,
which I have thus endeavoured to reprieve from immediate oblivion, was
originally addressed "To the Author of Poems published anonymously, at
Bristol." A second edition of these poems has lately appeared with the
Author's name prefixed; and I could not refuse myself the gratification
of seeing the name of that man among my poems, without whose kindness
they would probably have remained unpublished; and to whom I know myself
greatly and variously obliged, as a Poet, a Man and a Christian.

The second is entitled "An Effusion on an Autumnal Evening; written in
early youth." In a note to this poem I had asserted that the tale of
Florio in Mr. Rogers' "Pleasures of Memory" was to be found in the
Lochleven of Bruce. I did (and still do) perceive a certain likeness
between the two stories; but certainly not a sufficient one to justify
my assertion. I feel it my duty, therefore, to apologize to the Author
and the Public, for this rashness; and my sense of honesty would not
have been satisfied by the bare omission of the note. No one can see
more clearly the littleness and futility of imagining plagiarisms in
the works of men of Genius; but nemo omnibus horis sapit; and my mind,
at the time of writing that note, was sick and sore with anxiety, and
weakened through much suffering. I have not the most distant knowledge
of Mr. Rogers, except as a correct and elegant Poet. If any of my
readers should know him personally, they would oblige me by informing
him that I have expiated a sentence of unfounded detraction, by an
unsolicited and self-originating apology.

Having from these motives re-admitted two, and those the longest of the
poems I had omitted, I yielded a passport to the three others, [pp. 256,
262, 264] which were recommended by the greatest number of votes. There
are some lines too of Lloyd's and Lamb's in this Appendix. They had been
omitted in the former part of the volume, partly by accident; [1148]but I
have reason to believe that the Authors regard them, as of inferior
merit; and they are therefore rightly placed, where they will receive
some beauty from their vicinity to others much worse.

PREFACE

The following collection has been entitled Sibylline Leaves, in allusion
to the fragmentary and widely scattered state in which they have been
long suffered to remain. It contains the whole of the author's poetical
compositions, from 1793 to the present date, with the exception of a few
works not yet finished, and those published in the first edition of his
juvenile poems, over which he has no controul.[1150:1] They may be
divided into three classes: First, A selection from the Poems added to
the second and third editions, together with those originally published
in the Lyrical Ballads,[1150:2] which after having remained many years
out of print, have been omitted by Mr. Wordsworth in the recent
collection of all his minor poems, and of course revert to the author.
Second, Poems published at very different periods, in various obscure or
perishable journals, etc., some with, some without the writer's consent;
many imperfect, all incorrect. The third and last class is formed of
Poems which have [1151]hitherto remained in manuscript. The whole is now
presented to the reader collectively, with considerable additions and
alterations, and as perfect as the author's judgment and powers could
render them.

In my Literary Life, it has been mentioned that, with the exception of
this preface, the Sibylline Leaves have been printed almost two years;
and the necessity of troubling the reader with the list of
errata[1151:1] [forty-seven in number] which follows this preface, alone
induces me to refer again to the circumstances, at the risk of ungenial
feelings, from the recollection of its worthless causes.[1151:2] A few
corrections of later date have been added.&mdash;Henceforward the author must
be occupied by studies of a very different kind.


Ite hinc, Cam&oelig;n&aelig;! Vos quoque ite, suaves,
Dulces Cam&oelig;n&aelig;! Nam (fatebimur verum)
Dulces fuistis!&mdash;Et tamen meas chartas
Revisitote: sed pudenter et raro!


Virgil, Catalect. vii.[1151:3]

At the request of the friends of my youth, who still remain my friends,
and who were pleased with the wildness of the compositions, I have added
two school-boy poems&mdash;with a song modernized with some additions from
one of our elder poets.[1151:4] Surely, malice itself will scarcely
attribute their insertion to any other motive, than the wish to keep
alive the recollections from early life.&mdash;I scarcely knew what title I
should prefix to the first. By imaginary Time,[1151:5] I meant the state
of a school-boy's mind when, on his return to school, he projects his
being in his day dreams, and lives in his next holidays, six months
hence: and this I contrasted with real Time.

PREFACE

The Preface is the same as that of 1808 and 1828, with the addition of
the following passage (quoted as a foot-note to the sentence:&mdash;'I have
pruned the double-epithets with no sparing hand; and used my best
efforts to tame the swell and glitter both of thought and
diction.')&mdash;'Without any feeling of anger, I may yet be allowed to
express some degree of surprize, that after having run the critical
gauntlet for a certain class of faults, which I had, viz. a too ornate,
and elaborately poetic diction, and nothing having come before the
judgement-seat of the Reviewers during the long interval, I should for
at least seventeen years, quarter after quarter, have been placed by
them in the foremost rank of the proscribed, and made to abide the
brunt of abuse and ridicule for faults directly opposite, viz. bald and
prosaic language, and an affected simplicity both of matter and
manner&mdash;faults which assuredly did not enter into the character of my
compositions.&mdash;Literary Life, i. 51. Published 1817.' In the Biog.
Lit. (loc. cit.) the last seven lines of the quotation read as
follows&mdash;'judgement-seat in the interim, I should, year after year,
quarter after quarter, month after month (not to mention sundry petty
periodicals of still quicker revolution, 'or weekly or diurnal') have
been for at least seventeen years consecutively dragged forth by these
into the foremost rank of the proscribed, and forced to abide the
brunt of abuse, for faults directly opposite, and which I certainly had
not. How shall I explain this?'

Contents.&mdash;The Contents of Vols. I and III are identical with the
Contents of Vols. I and III of 1828 (No. XX): A 'Song' (Tho' veiled in
spires of myrtle wreath), p. 78, and 'The Alienated Mistress: A
Madrigal' (If Love be dead, &amp;c.), p. 93 of Vol. II, 1828, are omitted in
Vol. II of 1829; and 'The Allegoric Vision,' 'The Improvisatore, or John
Anderson, My Jo, John' [New Thoughts on old Subjects], and 'The Garden
of Boccaccio' are inserted in Vol. II of 1829; between 'The Wanderings
of Cain' and 'Remorse', pp. 116-42. The text of 1829, which J. D.
Campbell followed in P. W., 1893, differs from that of 1828.

This volume was prepared for the press by my lamented sister, Mrs. H. N.
Coleridge, and will have an additional interest to many readers as the
last monument of her highly-gifted mind. At her earnest request, my name
appears with hers on the title-page, but the assistance rendered by me
has been, in fact, little more than mechanical. The preface, and the
greater part of the notes, are her composition:&mdash;the selection and
arrangement have been determined almost exclusively by her critical
judgment, or from records in her possession. A few slight corrections
and unimportant additions are all that have been found necessary, the
first and last sheets not having had the benefit of her own revision.

[1169]
PREFACE TO THE PRESENT EDITION [1852]

As a chronological arrangement of Poetry in completed collections is now
beginning to find general favour, pains have been taken to follow this
method in the present Edition of S. T. Coleridge's Poetical and Dramatic
Works, as far as circumstances permitted&mdash;that is to say, as far as the
date of composition of each poem was ascertainable, and as far as the
plan could be carried out without effacing the classes into which the
Author had himself distributed his most important poetical publication,
the 'Sibylline Leaves,' namely, Poems occasioned by Political Events, or
Feelings connected with them; Love Poems; Meditative Poems in blank
verse; Odes and Miscellaneous Poems. On account of these impediments,
together with the fact, that many a poem, such as it appears in its
ultimate form, is the growth of different periods, the agreement with
chronology in this Edition is approximative rather than perfect: yet in
the majority of instances the date of each piece has been made out, and
its place fixed accordingly.

In another point of view also, the Poems have been distributed with
relation to time: they are thrown into three broad groups, representing,
first the Youth,&mdash;secondly, the Early Manhood and Middle Life,&mdash;thirdly,
the Declining Age of the Poet; and it will be readily perceived that
each division has its own distinct tone and colour, corresponding to the
period of life in which it was composed. It has been suggested, indeed,
that Coleridge had four poetical epochs, more or less diversely
characterised,&mdash;that there is a discernible difference betwixt the
productions of his Early Manhood and of his Middle Age, the latter being
distinguished from those of his Stowey life, which may be considered as
his poetic prime, by a less buoyant spirit. Fire they have; but it is
not the clear, bright, mounting fire of his earlier poetry, conceived
and executed when 'he and youth were house-mates still.' In the course
of a very few years after three-and-twenty all his very finest poems
were produced; his twenty-fifth year has been called his annus
mirabilis. To be a 'Prodigal's favourite&mdash;[1169:1]then, worse truth! a
Miser's pensioner,' is the lot of Man. In respect of poetry, Coleridge
was a 'Prodigal's favourite,' more, perhaps, than ever Poet was before.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*

[The poems] produced before the Author's twenty-fourth year [1796],
devoted as he was to the 'soft strains' of Bowles, have more in common
with the passionate lyrics of Collins and the picturesque wildness of
the pretended Ossian, than with the well-tuned sentimentality of that
Muse which the overgrateful poet has represented as his earliest
inspirer. For the young they will ever retain a peculiar charm, because
so fraught with the joyous spirit of youth; and in the minds of all
readers that feeling which disposes men 'to set the bud above the rose
full-blown' would secure them an interest, even if their intrinsic
beauty and sweetness were less adequate to obtain it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*

The present Editors have been guided in the general arrangement of this
edition by those of 1817 and 1828, which may be held to represent the
author's matured judgment upon the larger and more important part [1170]of
his poetical productions. They have reason, indeed, to believe, that the
edition of 1828 was the last upon which he was able to bestow personal
care and attention. That of 1834, the last year of his earthly
sojourning, a period when his thoughts were wholly engrossed, so far as
the decays of his frail outward part left them free for intellectual
pursuits and speculations, by a grand scheme of Christian Philosophy, to
the enunciation of which in a long projected work his chief thoughts and
aspirations had for many years been directed, was arranged mainly, if
not entirely, at the discretion of his earliest Editor, H. N.
Coleridge .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Such alterations only have been made in this final
arrangement of the Poetical and Dramatic Works of S. T. Coleridge, by
those into whose charge they have devolved, as they feel assured, both
the Author himself and his earliest Editor would at this time find to be
either necessary or desirable. The observations and experience of
eighteen years, a period long enough to bring about many changes in
literary opinion, have satisfied them that the immature essays of
boyhood and adolescence, not marked with any such prophetic note of
genius as certainly does belong to the four school-boy poems they have
retained, tend to injure the general effect of a body of poetry. That a
writer, especially a writer of verse, should keep out of sight his
third-rate performances, is now become a maxim with critics; for they
are not, at the worst, effectless: they have an effect, that of diluting
and weakening, to the reader's feelings, the general power of the
collection. Mr. Coleridge himself constantly, after 1796, rejected a
certain portion of his earliest published Juvenilia: never printed any
attempts of his boyhood, except those four with which the present
publication commences, and there can be no doubt that the Editor of 1834
would ere now have come to the conclusion, that only such of the
Author's early performances as were sealed by his own approval ought to
form a permanent part of the body of his poetical works.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*

It must be added, that time has robbed of their charm certain sportive
effusions of Mr. Coleridge's later years, which were given to the public
in the first gloss and glow of novelty in 1834, and has proved that,
though not devoid of the quality of genius, they possess upon the whole,
not more than an ephemeral interest. These the Editors have not scrupled
to omit on the same grounds and in the same confidence that has been
already explained.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*

ADVERTISEMENT

The last authorised edition of S. T. Coleridge's Poems, published by Mr.
Moxon in 1852, bears the names of Derwent and Sara Coleridge, as joint
editors. In writing my name with my sister's, I yielded to her
particular desire and request, but the work was performed almost
entirely by herself. My opinion was consulted as to the general
arrangement, and more especially as to the choice or rejection of
particular pieces. Even here I had no occasion to do more than confirm
the conclusions to which she had herself arrived, and sanction the
course which she had herself adopted. I shared in the responsibility,
but cannot claim any share in the credit of the undertaking. This
edition I propose to leave intact as it came from her own hands. I wish
it to remain as one among other monuments of her fine taste, her solid
judgment, and her scrupulous conscientiousness.

A few pieces of some interest appear, however, to have been overlooked.
Two characteristic sonnets, not included in any former edition of the
Poems, have been preserved in an anonymous work, entitled 'Letters,
Recollections, and Conversations of S. T. Coleridge.' These with a
further selection from the omitted pieces, principally from the Juvenile
Poems, have been added in an Appendix. So placed, they will not at any
rate interfere with the general effect of the collection, while they add
to its completeness.

All these buds of promise were once withdrawn, and, afterwards
reproduced by the Author. It is not easy now to draw a line of
separation, which shall not be deemed either too indulgent, or too
severe. [The concluding lines of the 'Advertisement' dealt with
questions of copyright].

Note.&mdash;Section 3 of the Introduction, pp. cxxxviii-clxxxvi, supplies a
Bibliography of the Poems. The Dramas are not included in the Poetical
Works. In the 'Table of Contents' poems not included in 1834 are marked
by an asterisk, but of these only three, (1) 'The Tears of a Grateful
People'; (2) 'The Humour of Pallas' ['My Godmother's Beard'], and (3)
'Lines written in the Common Place Book of Miss Barbour', were collected
for the first time. The 'Introduction', the work of a genuine poet,
contains much that is valuable and interesting, but the edition as a
whole is by no means an advancement on P. and D. W., 1877-1880.

The Poems include all those published in 1877-1880 with the addition of
the Hymn, first published in 1852, and the omission of 'The Old Man of
the Alps' (M. P., Apr. 13, 1798) together with the following pieces
collected for the first time (*), or printed for the first time from
MSS. (MS.):&mdash;(1) Dura Navis (MS.); (2) Nil pejus, &amp;c. (MS.); (3) Quae

Insignificant 'No doleful', &amp;c.; (4) On a Slanderer 'From yonder tomb',
&amp;c.; (5) 'Money I've heard', &amp;c.

Of fifty-four Fragments from a Common Place Book eighteen were first
printed in Literary Remains, i. 277-281, and the rest were published
or collected for the first time: of sixty-six Fragments from Various
Sources thirty-three were first published from MSS., and others were
collected for the first time.

Much had been accomplished by the Editor of P. and D. W., 1877-1880,
but the excellence of the critical apparatus, the style and substance of
the critical and explanatory notes, and the amount and quality of fresh
material have made and must continue to make the Edition of 1893 the
standard edition of Coleridge's Poetical Works. The 'Introductory
Memoir' was republished as 'A Narrative of the Life of Samuel Taylor
Coleridge', Macmillan, 1894.

[1140:1] The ancient little Wits wrote many poems in the shape
of Eggs, Altars, and Axes. (MS. Note by S. T. C.)

[1140:2] The title of the volume is 'Sonnets and Odes, by Henry
Francis Cary. Author of an Irregular Ode to General Elliot. London
1787.'

Lines 6-9 of the Sonnet read thus:&mdash;


From him deriv'd who shun'd and spurn'd the throng
And warbled sweet, thy Brooks and streams among,
Lonely Valclusa! and that heir of Fame
Our English Milton&mdash;


Line 14 reads:&mdash;


A grandeur, grace and spirit all their own.


The Poems were the first publication of 'Dante' Cary, then a boy of
fifteen, whom Coleridge first met at Muddiford in October, 1816, and
whose translation of the Divina Commedia he helped to make famous.

[1141:1] The three Sonnets of Bowles are not in any Edition
since the last quarto pamphlet of his Sonnets. (MS. Note by S. T. C.)

With his high spirit strove the master bard,
And was his own exceeding great reward.


The first Dialogue was published in May 1794. The lines on Gray may have
suggested Coleridge's quotation from Genesis, chap. xv, ver. 1, which is
supplied in a footnote to line 56.

[1150:1] The 'Eolian Harp', with the title 'Effusion xxxv.
Composed August 20, 1795, at Clevedon, Somersetshire', was first
published in 1796, and included as 'Composed at Clevedon' in 1797 and
1803. It is possible that it may have been originally printed in a
newspaper.

[1150:2] The fourth and last edition of the Lyrical Ballads
was issued in 1805.

[1151:1] The List numbers thirty, and of these not more than
twenty are strictly speaking Errata. Of the remainder the greater
number are textual corrections, emendations, and afterthoughts.

[1151:2] The allusion is to the prolonged and embittered
controversy between Coleridge and his friends at Bristol, who had
printed his works and advanced him various sums of money on the security
of the sheets as printed and the future sale of the works when
published. They were angry with him for postponing completion of these
works, and keeping them out of their money, and he was naturally and
reasonably indignant at the excessive sum charged for paper and
printing. The fact was that they had done and intended to do him a
kindness, but that in so far as it was a business transaction he
suffered at their hands.

Studiis Philosophiam Epicuream amplectitur'.

  An evil spirit's on thee, friend! of late!

  And arrows steeled with wrath
  994


  And cauldrons the scoop'd earth, a boiling sea

  And my heart mantles in its own delight
  1002


  And Pity's sigh shall answer thy tale of Anguish
  990


  And re-implace God's Image of the Soul
  994


  And this place our forefathers made for man
  185


  And this reft house is that the which he built
  211


  And with my whole heart sing the stately song
  994


  And write Impromptus
  989


  Are there two things, of all which men possess
  361


  As Dick and I at Charing Cross were walking
  960


  As I am a Rhymer
  477


  As late each flower that sweetest blows
  45


  As late I journey'd o'er the extensive plain
  11


  As late I lay in Slumber's shadowy vale
  80


  As late, in wreaths, gay flowers I bound
  33


  As late on Skiddaw's mount I lay supine
  350


  As long as ere the life-blood's running
  961


  As oft mine eye with careless glance
  104


  As some vast Tropic tree, itself a wood
  1001


  As the shy hind, the soft-eyed gentle Brute
  1013


  As the tir'd savage, who his drowsy frame
  1023


  As when a child on some long Winter's night
  85


  As when far off the warbled strains are heard
  82


  [1190]As when the new or full Moon urges
  1005


  At midnight by the stream I roved
  253


  Auspicious Reverence! Hush all meaner song
  131, 1024


  Away, those cloudy looks, that labouring sigh
  90

&nbsp;

  Be proud as Spaniards! Leap for pride ye Fleas!
  980


  'Be, rather than be called, a child of God'
  312


  Behind the thin Grey cloud
  992


  Behold yon row of pines, that shorn and bow'd
  1006


  Beneath the blaze of a tropical sun
  396


  Beneath this stone does William Hazlitt lie
  962


  Beneath this thorn when I was young
  269


  Beneath yon birch with silver bark
  293


  Benign shooting stars, ecstatic delight
  1015


  Bob now resolves on marriage schemes to trample
  953


  Bright cloud of reverence, sufferably bright
  998


  Britannia's boast, her glory and her pride
  970


  Britons! when last ye met, with distant streak
  150


  Broad-breasted Pollards, with broad-branching heads
  992


  Broad-breasted rook-hanging cliff that glasses
  988


  By many a booby's vengeance bit
  953

&nbsp;

  Charles, grave or merry, at no lie would stick
  964


  Charles! my slow heart was only sad, when first
  154


  Child of my muse! in Barbour's gentle hand
  483


  Come, come thou bleak December wind
  1001


  Come hither, gently rowing
  311


  Come; your opinion of my manuscript
  967


  Cupid, if storying Legends tell aright
  46

&nbsp;

  Dear Charles! whilst yet thou wert a babe, I ween
  158


  Dear native Brook! wild Streamlet of the West
  48


  Dear tho' unseen! tho' I have left behind
  468


  Deep in the gulph of Vice and Woe
  12


  Depart in joy from this world's noise and strife
  177


  Didst thou think less of thy dear self
  965


  Dim Hour! that sleep'st on pillowing clouds afar
  96


  Discontent mild as an infant
  991


  Do call, dear Jess, whene'er my way you come
  962


  Do you ask what the birds say? The Sparrow, the Dove
  386


  Dormi, Jesu! Mater ridet
  417


  Due to the Staggerers, that made drunk by Power
  989

&nbsp;

  Each Bond-street buck conceits, unhappy elf
  968


  Each crime that once estranges from the virtues
  1011


  Earth! thou mother of numberless children, the nurse and the mother
  327


  Edmund! thy grave with aching eye I scan
  76


  Encinctured with a twine of leaves
  287


  Ere on my bed my limbs I lay (1803)
  389


  Ere on my bed my limbs I lay (1806)
  401


  Ere Sin could blight or Sorrow fade
  68


  Ere the birth of my life, if I wished it or no
  419


  Eu! Dei vices gerens, ipse Divus
  981

&nbsp;

  Farewell, parental scenes! a sad farewell
  29


  Farewell, sweet Love! yet blame you not my truth
  402


  Fear no more, thou timid Flower
  356


  'Fie, Mr. Coleridge!&mdash;and can this be you?
  441


  Flowers are lovely, Love is flower-like
  1085, 1086


  Fond, peevish, wedded pair! why all this rant?
  984


  [1191]For ever in the world of Fame
  1013


  Frail creatures are we all! To be the best
  486


  Friend, Lover, Husband, Sister, Brother
  392


  Friend of the wise! and Teacher of the Good
  403


  Friend pure of heart and fervent! we have learnt
  1008


  Friends should be weigh'd, not told; who boasts to have won
  963


  From his brimstone bed at break of day
  319


  From me, Aurelia! you desired
  966


  From Rufa's eye sly Cupid shot his dart
  952


  From yonder tomb of recent date
  955

&nbsp;

  Gently I took that which ungently came
  488


  &#915;&#957;&#8182;&#952;&#953; &#963;&#949;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#8057;&#957;!&mdash;and is this the prime

  Good Candle, thou that with thy brother, Fire
  969


  Good verse most good, and bad verse then seems better
  96


  Grant me a Patron, gracious Heaven! whene'er

  10


  Hence, soul-dissolving Harmony
  28


  Hence that fantastic wantonness of woe
  157


  Hence! thou fiend of gloomy sway

  Here's Jem's first copy of nonsense verses
  983


  Here lies a Poet; or what once was he

  970


  High o'er the rocks at night I rov'd
  1050, 1051


  High o'er the silver rocks I rov'd
  1049


  Hippona lets no silly flush

  Hoarse Maevius reads his hobbling verse
  955


  How long will ye round me be swelling

  How seldom, friend! a good great man inherits

  I ask'd my fair one happy day
  318


  I fancy whenever I spy Nosy
  953


  I from the influence of thy Looks receive
  999


  I have experienced the worst the world can wreak on me
  1004


  I have heard of reasons manifold
  418


  I heard a voice from Etna's side
  347


  I heard a voice pealing loud triumph to-day
  1014


  I hold of all our viperous race
  959


  I know it is dark; and though I have lain
  382


  I know 'tis but a dream, yet feel more anguish
  998


  I love, and he loves me again
  1118


  [1192]I mix in life, and labour to seem free
  292


  I never saw the man whom you describe
  182


  I note the moods and feelings men betray
  448


  I sigh, fair injur'd stranger! for thy fate
  152


  I stand alone, nor tho' my heart should break

  I stood on Brocken's sovran height, and saw
  315


  I too a sister had! too cruel Death
  21


  I touch this scar upon my skull behind
  984


  I wish on earth to sing
  1017


  I yet remain To mourn
  1124


  If dead, we cease to be; if total gloom
  425


  If fair by Nature
  1012


  If I had but two little wings
  313


  If Love be dead

  If Pegasus will let thee only ride him

  If the guilt of all lying consists in deceit
  954


  If thou wert here, these tears were tears of light
  386


  If while my passion I impart

  Tho' much averse, dear Jack, to flicker
  37


  Tho' no bold flights to thee belong
  9


  Though rous'd by that dark Vizir Riot rude
  81


  Though veiled in spires of myrtle-wreath
  450


  Three truths should make thee often think and pause
  966


  Through weeds and thorns, and matted underwood
  369


  Thus far my scanty brain hath built the rhyme
  78


  Thus she said, and all around
  1015


  Thy babes ne'er greet thee with the father's name
  960


  Thy lap-dog, Rufa, is a dainty beast
  960


  Thy smiles I note, sweet early Flower
  149


  Thy stern and sullen eye, and thy dark brow
  994


  'Tis hard on Bagshot Heath to try
  26


  'Tis mine and it is likewise yours
  997


  'Tis not the lily-brow I prize
  483


  'Tis sweet to him who all the week
  314


  'Tis the middle of night by the castle clock
  215


  'Tis true, Idoloclastes Satyrane
  413


  [1197]To be ruled like a Frenchman the Briton is both
  953


  To know, to esteem, to love,&mdash;and then to part
  410


  To praise men as good, and to take them for such
  486


  To tempt the dangerous deep, too venturous youth
  2


  To wed a fool, I really cannot see
  963


  Tom Hill, who laughs at Cares and Woes
  974


  Tom Slothful talks, as slothful Tom beseems
  967


  Tranquillity! thou better name
  360


  Tr&#333;ch&#277;e tr&#299;ps fr&#335;m long t&#335; sh&#333;rt
  401


  Truth I pursued, as Fancy sketch'd the way
  1008


  'Twas my last waking thought, how it could be
  454


  'Twas not a mist, nor was it quite a cloud
  1000


  'Twas sweet to know it only possible
  992


  Two things hast thou made known to half the nation
  964


  Two wedded hearts, if ere were such
  1003

&nbsp;

  Unboastful Bard! whose verse concise yet clear
  102


  Unchanged within, to see all changed without
  459


  Under the arms of a goodly oak-tree
  1048


  Under this stone does Walter Harcourt lie
  962


  Underneath an old oak tree
  169


  Ungrateful he, who pluck'd thee from thy stalk
  70


  Unperishing youth
  308


  Up, up! ye dames, and lasses gay
  427


  Up, up! ye dames, ye lasses gay
  942


  Upon the mountain's edge with light touch resting
  393


  Utter the song, O my soul! the flight and return of Mohammed
  329

&nbsp;

  Verse, a breeze mid blossoms straying
  439


  Verse, pictures, music, thoughts both grave and gay
  482


  Verse, that Breeze mid blossoms straying
  1085


  Virtues and Woes alike too great for man
  37


  Vivit sed mihi non vivit&mdash;nova forte marita
  56

&nbsp;

  Water and windmills, greenness, Islets green
  1009


  We both attended the same College
  955


  We pledged our hearts, my love and I
  391


  Well! If the Bard was weather-wise, who made
  362, 1076


  Well, they are gone, and here must I remain
  178


  We've conquer'd us a Peace, like lads true metalled
  972


  We've fought for Peace, and conquer'd it at last
  972


  What a spring-tide of Love to dear friends in a shoal
  1010


  What boots to tell how o'er his grave
  1011


  What is an Epigram? a dwarfish whole
  963


  What never is, but only is to be
  999


  What now, O Man! thou dost or mean'st to do
  414


  What pleasures shall he ever find
  4


  What though the chilly wide-mouth'd quacking chorus
  476


  Whate'er thou giv'st, it still is sweet to me
  1010


  When British Freedom for an happier land
  79


  When Hope but made Tranquillity be felt
  1004


  When Surface talks of other people's worth
  969


  When the squalls were flitting and fleering
  980


  When they did greet me father, sudden awe
  152


  When thieves come, I bark: when gallants, I am still
  966


  When thou to my true-love com'st
  326


  When thy Beauty appears
  1016


  When Youth his faery reign began
  62


  Whene'er the mist, that stands 'twixt God and thee
  487


  Where Cam his stealthy flowings most dissembles
  988


  Where deep in mud Cam rolls his slumbrous stream
  35


  [1198]Where graced with many a classic spoil
  29


  Where is the grave of Sir Arthur O'Kellyn
  432


  Where true Love burns Desire is love's pure flame
  485


  Where'er I find the Good, the True, the Fair
  1011


  Wherefore art thou come?
  989


  While my young cheek retains its healthful hues
  236


  Whilst pale Anxiety, corrosive Care
  69


  Whom should I choose for my Judge?
  1000


  Whom the untaught Shepherds call
  40


  Why is my Love like the Sun?
  1109


  Why need I say, Louisa dear
  252


  William, my teacher, my friend
  304


  Wisdom, Mother of retired Thought
  991


  With Donne, whose muse on dromedary trots
  433


  With many a pause and oft reverted eye
  94


  With many a weary step at length I gain
  56


  With secret hand heal the conjectur'd wound
  988


  With skill that never Alchemist yet told
  995


  Within these circling hollies woodbine-clad
  409


  Within these wilds was Anna wont to rove
  16

&nbsp;

  Ye Clouds! that far above me float and pause
  243


  Ye drinkers of Stingo and Nappy so free
  978


  Ye fowls of ill presage
  1017


  Ye Gales, that of the Lark's repose
  35


  Ye harp-controlling hymns
  1006


  Ye souls unus'd to lofty verse
  8


  Yes, noble old Warrior! this heart has beat high
  317


  Yes, yes! that boon, life's richest treat
  466


  Yet art thou happier far than she
  62


  Yon row of bleak and visionary pines
  1006


  You're careful o'er your wealth 'tis true
  958


  You come from o'er the waters
  987


  You loved the daughter of Don Manrique?
  421


  You mould my Hopes, you fashion me within
  1002


  Your Poem must eternal be
  959

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
