Pollyanna

The glad play, by Catherine Chisholm Cushing, after the
novel by Eleanor H. Porter. 5 males, 6 females. 2 interiors.
Costumes, modern. Plays 2         hours. An orphan girl is thrust
into the home of a maiden aunt. In spite of the trials that
beset her, she manages to find something to be glad about, and
brings light into sunless lives. Finally Pollyanna straightens
out the love affairs of her elders, and finds happiness for herself
in Jimmy. "Pollyanna" gives a better appreciation of people
and the world. It reflects the humor and humanity that gave
the story such wonderful popularity among young and old.

Produced in New York, and for two seasons on tour. Royalty,
$25.00. Price, 75 cents.

Martha By-the-Day

An optimistic comedy in 3 acts, by Julie M. Lippmann, author
of the "Martha" stories. 5 males. 5 females. 3 interiors. Costumes,
modern. Plays 2         hours.

Full of quaint humor, old-fashioned, homely sentiment, the
kind that people who see the play will recall and chuckle over
tomorrow and the next day.

Miss Lippmann has herself adapted her successful book for
the stage and has selected from her novel the most telling
incidents, infectious comedy and homely sentiment for the
play, and the result is thoroughly delightful. Royalty, $25.
Price, 60 cents.

Seventeen

A comedy of youth, in 4 acts, by Booth Tarkington. 8 males,
6 females. 1 exterior. 2 interiors. Costumes, modern. Plays
2         hours.

It is the tragedy of William Sylvanus Baxter that he has
ceased to be sixteen and is not yet eighteen. Seventeen is not
an age, it is a disease.

In his heart William knows all the tortures and delights of
love. But he is still sent by his mother on errands of the most
humiliating sort and depends on his father for every nickel,
the use of which he must justify before he gets it.

"Silly" Bill fell in love with Lola, the "Baby-Talk Lady,"
a vapid little flirt. To woo her in a manner worthy of himself
(and of her) he steals his father's evening clothes. When his
wooings become a nuisance to the neighborhood, his mother
steals them back, and has them let out to fit the middle-aged
form of her husband, thereby keeping William at home.

But when it comes to the "Baby-Talk Lady's" good-bye
dance, not to be present was unendurable. Now William again
gets the dress suit, and how he wears it at the party, and
Genesis discloses the fact that the proud garment is in reality
his father's makes up the story of the play.

"Seventeen" is a work of exquisite human sympathy and
delicious humor. Royalty, $25.00. Price. 75 cents.

The Ghost Breaker



ACT I



Scene:
Room 1121, Manhattan Hotel, New York City.


At rise stage dark. Moonlight streams through the
window. Small clock strikes five. Pause.
Tower clock strikes. Two gun-shots heard off
stage right. Door slams off stage. Footsteps
heard coming along corridor, growing hubbub
and commotion. Princess pokes head through
curtains. r. door bursts open and Warren
Jarvis enters hurriedly, in long coat over evening
dress, closing and bolting the door behind him.

Princess. Madre de Dios! (Showing only her
head.) (Jarvis kicks in door, shuts it, and throws
his shoulder against it.) Who's there?

Jarvis. Sh! Don't make any noise.

Princess. (Winding her dressing gown closely
about her and coming a little way into the room)
What do you want?

Jarvis. Silence!

Princess. (Switches on lamp on right table)
How dare you enter!

Jarvis. Sh! Not a sound       do you understand?

[6]Voice Off. (r.) What's the row?

Second Voice. (r.) Somebody fired a pistol.

Princess. What right       ?

Jarvis. Quiet!

Voice. Where'd he go? Look on the fire-escape.

Second Voice. No, he's on this floor.

Princess. What is it? What do you want here?
What have you done?

Jarvis. (Turning to her) Now, it's all right.
I'm not going to harm you. If you will just keep
quiet. Is that clear to you?

Princess. Is it money you want? All the money
I have is on that dressing table. (Pointing.) Take
it and go.

Jarvis. I'm not a burglar. I don't want your
money.

Princess. Well, then, what do you want? (Sound
of running in corridor coming toward door r.)

Jarvis. Listen               (Turns back to door.)
They're coming here. (To Princess) They mustn't
search this room, do you understand       you must put
them off       I'm not what you think I am. (Running
dies away. Jarvis turns to Princess.) Is there
no way out through that door? (Indicates door
5r.)

Princess. That is my maid's room.

Jarvis. The fire-escape       where is it?

Princess. In the hall opposite.

Jarvis. I thought that red light meant in here.
Hell! I beg your pardon.

Princess. Well, why don't you go?

Jarvis. I can't go that way. (Indicating door
6l.) They'll be waiting for me in the hall.

Princess. Well, what do you expect me to do?

Jarvis. The light fooled me. I thought that
door led to the fire-escape.

Princess. You said that before.

Jarvis. Ha! Ha!

[7]Princess. Is the situation so amusing?

Jarvis. I beg your pardon. I'm not laughing at
you. I blundered in here by mistake. I'm in a tight
fix. I can't leave by that door. I must find some
other. (Sees door 8, across to door 8, and, disgusted,
exclaims when he sees there is no way out
there. Notices blood on hand and starts to put
handkerchief around it.)

Princess. (Going down stage c.) What's happened?
You're wounded! Those shots I heard              

Jarvis. I almost stopped one of the bullets.

Princess. Your hand is bleeding.

Jarvis. Please       I don't see how the devil              
(Runs up and puts up shade at window 3, sees there
is no way out.) Damn!

Princess. You have evidently shot someone and
are making me shield you from justice.

Jarvis. (Coming down) No, not from justice       but
from the law.

Princess. I thought they were the same.

Jarvis. No, not always       there would be no justice
for me at the hands of the law.

Princess. Well, that is not for me to decide.

Jarvis. But you shall decide       at least you shall
listen and if you find me guilty       I'll       well, I'll take
that door or, or anything you say.

Princess. Your presumption is indeed ridiculous.

Jarvis. Hardly ridiculous       I am arguing for my life.

Princess. Can any decision be more unjust than
mine must be at the point of a pistol?

Jarvis. (Lays pistol on dressing table l. and
crosses to r. of Princess.) There is nothing
to prevent
your calling for help now       after all, it doesn't
matter much whether the end comes today or the day after.

[8]Princess. The end? Then why don't you give
yourself up?

Jarvis. That would not have been the end. You
don't understand, I know, but I'm not flying from
Justice. There was in this a case of shoot or be
shot. (Sound of running toward door 6.) Listen       they're
here now. (Jarvis crosses door 8.)

House Detective. (Knock outside door) Anybody
in here? (Knock.) Open the door.

Jarvis. It's up to you to do with me as you like.
(Princess points to door l. Jarvis exits.)

Nita. (Off stage door 5) Madame       Madame       (Enters.)
What is it? (Running to mistress for
protection.) Something dreadful must have happened.
(Knock on door repeated.) What shall I do?

Princess. Open it, Nita.
(Nita opens door reluctantly.)

House Detective. (In doorway) Are you all
right in here?

Nita. (Holding door open) Si       Se        or.

Princess. What is it, Nita?

Nita. (Indicating Princess) My mistress,
Se        or.

House Detective. (Inside of door       removing
hat) Excuse me, madame, I'm the house detective.
Are you all right in here?

Princess. Yes.

House Detective. We're sorry to bother you,
but we're looking for someone and we thought he
might have come in here. If you want anything
we'll be out here in the hall. Good night!

Nita. (Shuts door and runs to Princess c.)
Forgive me, Madame, but I am so frightened. What
is it? What is it?

Princess. Control yourself, Nita. Go to bed,
child. (Nita goes to door 5.) I won't need you
till six o'clock. (Exit Nita.)

[9]Jarvis. (Entering L.C.) Thank you. Would
you mind bolting that door again? He might return.
(Princess crosses to door and bolts it.) Do
you know what a feud is?

Princess. Feud? Spain is the home of feuds.

Jarvis. So is Kentucky. That's where I came
from. You're Spanish?

Princess. Yes.

Jarvis. Then you'll understand       those shots you
heard, that was the end of a feud. I was called
home suddenly by the death of my father       shot in
the back       feud       man after man       two families       the
Marcums and my own had shot each other down.
Then my Dad fell and I was left to fight it out alone.

Princess. Couldn't you?

Jarvis. Couldn't I? God only knows what I've
been through since. Those two shots you heard       that
was the finish. This morning when I got back
to my hotel, there was a message waiting for me. It
was signed Jim Marcum, head of the family, and
proposed that, as we were out of Kentucky, we meet
and end the feud amicably. He asked me to meet
him at this hotel in his room       no matter what hour       he
would be waiting. He was leaving at six in the
morning and wanted it settled. It was a pretty
scheme. I knew the man and I saw the trap. I
came over here prepared and went directly to his
room. It was on this floor. I flung open the door
and met Jim Marcum face to face. He was waiting.
Without a word he fired. I fired, and he dropped.
Now do you understand why the law would not give
me justice?

Princess. Did you kill him?

Jarvis. I don't know       I didn't wait.

Princess. What are you going to do?

Jarvis. I don't know. Do you know what it
means to fight single-handed against fearful odds       to
fight an endless fight alone?

[10]Princess. Yes       yes       I know.

Jarvis. Endless fight       without even a single
word of encouragement?

Princess. Yes, I know what it means.

Jarvis. You know? How could you know?
How could any woman know?

Princess. Yes, I do know, because I too am
fighting against fearful odds.

Jarvis. There is no man to fight for you?

Princess. No man left who dares.

Jarvis. God, if there had only been some woman
to fight for in my fight!

Princess. Your mother?

Jarvis. She's gone, too.

Princess. Are you alone?

Jarvis. Alone.

Princess. If you're caught it means your life.

Jarvis. Yes.

Princess. Suppose I decide to help you?

Jarvis. What do you mean?

Princess. You have no fear of death? You are
not afraid of ghosts?

Jarvis. No, I'm not afraid of ghosts.

Princess. If you escape from here it will be because
I helped you       we might say I saved your life,
if what you tell me is true       and if I do it, it will be
from a selfish motive entirely       it will be because I
have work for you. Do you understand? Work       hard
work       dangerous work. It may mean your
life in the end.

Jarvis. You are frank, anyway.

Princess. It's a chance       and you have nothing
to lose.

Jarvis. And if I agree?

Princess. You will begin by taking the ancient
feudal oath of my country.

Jarvis. Oath? Isn't my word good enough?

Princess. You will pardon me if I insist.

[11]Jarvis. Very well       I'll swear the blackest oath
you can utter. Let's hear it.

Princess. What's your name?

Jarvis. Jarvis.

Princess. Your full name?

Jarvis. Warren Jarvis.

Princess. Kneel, then, Warren of Jarvis. (Jarvis
kneels on both knees.) No, not that way       on one
knee.

Jarvis. I beg your pardon              

Princess. Now repeat this oath: "I, Warren of
Jarvis              "

Jarvis. "I, Warren of Jarvis              "

Princess. "Se        or of all the domains, fiefs, keeps
and marshes of Warren of Kentucky              "

Jarvis. Whew               "Se        or of all the domains,
fiefs, keeps and marshes of Warren of Kentucky       "

Princess. "Do convey to Maria Theresa, of
Aragon, all my worldly titles and possessions              "
Now take my left hand in both of yours and repeat,
"       and receive them back as vassal and retainer."

Jarvis. "And receive them back as vassal and
retainer."

Princess. "And do faithfully fight in my lady's
cause according to the feudal laws of Castile and
Aragon."

Jarvis. "And do faithfully fight in my lady's
cause according to the feudal laws of Castile and
Aragon."

Princess. Arise, vassal. (Jarvis arises and
kisses her hand.) That is part of the ceremony, but
I meant to omit it.

Jarvis. I thought that the only sensible part. I
beg your pardon       but who on earth is this Maria
Theresa that I am hired man to?

Princess. I       am Her Highness       Maria Theresa       Princess
of Aragon.

[12]Jarvis. Good night! You a Princess! And I
have been ordering you around with a gun. (Sound
of running for a moment.) Sh! (Crosses to door
r., listens.) It's all right, but how am I going to get
out? They've got me in a trap here.

Princess. The trunk              

Jarvis. The trunk? What about it?

Princess. I am sending it on board the Aquitania
at six o'clock.

Jarvis. (Dragging trunk down stage) You
mean to get in it? Good Lord, is it big enough?

Princess. I think so       and no one could possibly
suspect               (Jarvis takes out trays       locket drops
out       back to audience.) Oh              

Jarvis. What is it?

Princess. It's nothing       I mean it's all right       it's
just a locket.

Jarvis. Did I break it?

Princess. No               (Jarvis takes contents out
of trunk.) I broke it myself on purpose       yesterday.
It means a great deal to me and perhaps to
you. Some day you may know the reason why.

Jarvis. (Gets in trunk) Would you mind putting
this lid down? (Princess puts down lid of
trunk on Jarvis. Grunts.) O-oo-ou-ugh! (Raises
lid and stands up in trunk. Princess raises lid all
the way back as soon as Jarvis shouts.) I'll die in
there.

Princess. But it's a chance.

Jarvis. You're right! I'll take it. (Gets out of
trunk and goes to trays.) What are we going to do
with these?

Princess. We had better send those by messenger.

Jarvis. (Turning) Hold on       I've got it. No,
you had better 'phone. (Princess crosses to 'phone
r.) Ask the operator to give you the Hotel Belmont,
[13]across the street. My room is 417. Rusty, my servant,
is there now, waiting for word from me. (He
crosses to Princess.) He can be trusted. Tell him
to come here at once       and say "Warren." That
will fetch him.

Princess. 417? Hello               Connect me with
the Hotel Belmont, please.

Jarvis. Remember, ask for room 417.

Princess. Yes, I know. Hello, hello! Is this
the Belmont?       Give me room 417.

Jarvis. Ask if it's Rusty and be sure and say
"Warren."

Princess. Hello       is this Mr. Rusty? Well, listen
carefully. You are to come right over to the
Manhattan Hotel, across the street from where you
are. A bellboy will be waiting for you at the desk,
and he is to bring you right up to room 1121.

Jarvis. And tell him to keep his mouth shut              

Princess. And       and       don't talk to anyone....
What's that? "Warren." He'll be coming right
over.

Jarvis. Now get the clerk downstairs, and tell
them to look out for Rusty and send him up here.

Princess. Hello, hello! I'm expecting a man       

Jarvis. A colored man.

Princess. A colored man. To get some things.
He will come right to the desk. Please send him
up at once. It is very important. (Jarvis takes
out knife and begins boring hole in trunk from inside
out. This hole should be already cut and covered
with a label.) What are you doing that for?

Jarvis. Got to breathe. I think I can               (Apparently
the knife breaks.) Confound it!

Princess. What did you do?

Jarvis. Snapped the blade. Now how am I going
to cut a hole in that trunk?

Princess. (Crossing to dresser) Will my shears do?

[14]Jarvis. If they are not too large. Where are
they? (Princess gives Jarvis shears.) Thank
you. What time does the boat sail?

Princess. Nine o'clock.

Jarvis. Good       that will give Rusty time to get
aboard with these trays and my baggage.

Princess. We've ten minutes before they call
for the trunk. (Knock at door 6. Princess looks
at Jarvis, who makes gesture cautioning silence and
exits door l. Princess crosses and opens door.)
Come in, please.

Rusty. (Enter across center) Where's Marse
Warren              ? (Enter Jarvis across to Rusty.)
Lord bless you, Marse Warren       I certainly thought
he got you!

Jarvis. (Patting Rusty on the back) Never
mind what you thought. Help me with these       it's
ten minutes to six       we sail for Europe in three hours.

Rusty. Three hours! Good Lord! You mean we              

Jarvis. Yes, you and I. What are we going to
wrap these in? (Picking up trays.)

Princess. Here, this will do. (Handing steamer
rug from chair.)

Jarvis. Fine! (Spreading steamer rug on trunk
and putting tray on it, wraps up tray during speech.)
Take these, with our baggage, to the steamship
Aquitania       Cunard Line. Buy accommodations.
Mind, you won't see me till after we get out at sea.
Keep in your stateroom and sit tight till you hear
from me. You understand? Cunard Line       and the
clerk at our hotel will attend to everything and get
the tickets. Then you pay the bill. Now get hold
of this money. (Jarvis gives Rusty money.) I
beg your pardon! This is Rusty. Rusty, this is
the Princess of Aragon.

[15]Rusty. How do you do, Mrs. Princess?

Jarvis. There       that will do. Now do you understand?

Rusty. Yes, sir. I take everything to the steamboat       get
accom       ac-commoda       accommoda              

Jarvis. Accommodations.

Rusty. Accomo       accommoda               I know what
you mean. (With smile at Princess.) For us and
Mrs. Princess?

Jarvis. No, no       not for the Princess       just for
we two.

Rusty. Oh, yas, sir, I understand perfectly, sir.

Jarvis. (Gives parcel to Rusty) Now, then,
what's the name of the boat?

Rusty. The Aqui-tania.

Jarvis. What's the name of the line?

Rusty. The Cunard.

Jarvis. Now be off, and don't miss that boat.
(Princess opens door.)

Rusty. (Exiting) No, sir, I won't miss it.

Princess. (As Rusty reaches door) Good-bye,
Rusty.

Rusty. (Turning) Good-bye, Miss       er       Princess.

(Jarvis resumes work on trunk. Princess crosses
to Jarvis.)

Princess. Can you do it?

Jarvis. I think so       yes, it's going       there it goes       through!

Princess. Make another. (She crosses to the
dresser.)

Jarvis. Haven't time. I'll widen this one a little.
Remember this trunk must not go in the hold of the
ship. Have it marked "Wanted" and "This end up."
I will lie with my head this way. I'll put the shears
[16]
in here, and I can cut another hole from the inside
if it gets too stuffy.

Princess. (Takes revolver from dressing table
and gives it to Jarvis) And you better take this,
too.

Jarvis. How do you know you can trust me?

Princess. I don't       I have to take that chance.

Jarvis. You must have a pretty good reason.

Princess. I have.

Jarvis. Now, before I get in this, there's just
one or two things I would like to know. What about
the ghost?

Princess. Are you afraid?

Jarvis. Lord, no, I just wanted to know       that's all.

Princess. You'll know in time, Mr. Jarvis.

Jarvis. Are you really       a sure thing       Princess?

Princess. Why did you say that?

Jarvis. Oh, I don't know. Somehow you're not
quite like what I thought a Princess would be.

Princess. I'm sorry.

Jarvis. Oh, I didn't mean it that way. I mean
that you're different from the popular idea of a
Princess. You have more understanding       more
sympathy       more heart.

Princess. (Icily) In that respect, sir, you will
find me quite like your popular idea.

Jarvis. (Squelched) I wonder if that hole will
let in enough air?

Princess. I hope so. (Porter knocks.) It
must be the men for the trunk. Who is it, please?

Porter. Trunks.

Jarvis. (Getting into trunk) Remember? This
trunk must not go into the hold of the ship. You
must have it marked "Wanted" and "This side up."
You might add, "With Care," if you've a mind to.

Princess. Are you all right?

Jarvis. No.

Princess. (Shuts trunk, crosses and opens door)
The trunk is ready.

Porter. (Enter and cross with truck l. of trunk)
Very good, ma'am.

Princess. Have the other trunks gone?

Porter. Yes'm, last night.

Princess. This goes on the special wagon, Porter.

(Enter House Detective and sees broken door.)

Porter. (Setting trunk on end) Yes, mum. I'll
see that a special sticker is put on it.

Princess. (Crosses left of trunk) Have it
marked "Wanted" and "This end up."

Porter. (Putting trunk on truck) You'll find it
in your room when you get down to the steamer.

Princess. And, Porter, handle it gently.

Porter. Shore, I never smashed one in my life.
(Starts off r.) I'll handle it like it had glass on the
inside, so don't worry one little bit.

House Detective. (Stopping trunk c.
to Princess)
Just a minute, Porter. How did that lock get broken?

Princess. (Frightened, but trying not to show
it) It was broken when I came.

Detective. How long have you been here?

Princess. We came yesterday.

Detective. How long are you going to stay?

Princess. We sail this morning for Europe.

Detective. Huh! Excuse me, Madame, but the
police are making an investigation and they would
like to take in this room. Do you mind?

Princess. No.

Detective. What time does your boat sail?

Princess. We are sailing at nine o'clock.

Detective. Does this trunk go on board?

[18]Princess. (Relieved) Yes, I want it to go on a
special wagon.

Detective. All right, Porter. Go ahead. (Exit
Porter with trunk. To the Police who are supposed
to be off r.) Come in.

CURTAIN


[19]

ACT II

Scene: An elegantly furnished stateroom on the
S.S. Aquitania.

At Rise is empty, shuffling and murmuring of crowd
on deck. "All visitors ashore!" heard in distance.

Door l., leading to promenade deck outside;
door r. leading to another room; windows or portholes
in rear looking out; closet down r. Lights full
up, amber and white.

Trunk that was carried off stage in first act discovered
stage c., wrong side up. Markings that
were put on it first act are now upside down.
Trunk on end. When curtain rises up trunk
begins to rock back and forth as though something
inside was trying to turn it over. When
probable laugh has died away, door l. opens.
Stateroom Steward is showing Princess and
Nita in.

Steward. (Opening door l. and standing aside
to allow Princess and Nita to enter.
Princess
enters first and trunk upside down immediately catches
her eye. When Princess well in room, enter Nita,
who stumbles over raised sill. Solicitously) Oh,
I'm sorry! Did you hurt yourself? (Steward lays
bags and satchels on seat, back to audience.) Rather
inconvenient, those doors, till you get used to them,
but necessary to keep out the water in rough weather.

Princess. (l., paying very little attention to
[20]Steward, only anxious to get rid of him and Nita
so she may turn trunk over.) You don't anticipate
a bad passage, Steward?

Steward. (r., fussing about) Rather uncertain
at this season, but your location is good, Madam,
and you'll find she's as steady as a church.

Princess. (Looking around as Steward arranges
things fussily) This is very pleasant. (Nita arranges
bags and grips on window seat.)

Steward. Quite the best suite on board, Madam.
Here is the clothes press, and the other rooms are
off there. (Opening door l. and closing it again.)
If you want anything       (Points l.)       there is the
telephone. (Notices trunk in middle of room for
first time. Takes hold.) I'll place your trunk               (Starts
to move trunk and drags it to side.)

Princess. (Quickly stopping him) Never mind
now, Steward. You can place it later. (Steward
releases trunk, but does not set it down.) You might
turn it right side up.

Steward. (Noticing labels) Oh, I'm sorry!
(Turns trunk. Princess sighs.) I hope the contents
are not upset, madam.

Princess. I hope not.

Steward. Anything more, Madam?

Princess. (Anxious to get him out of room)
Not now, thank you, Steward. How soon do we sail?

Steward. Very soon now. (Voices off calling,
"All ashore!" four times; voice approaches and dies
away.) They're already calling "All ashore," Madam.
(Exit and closes door.)

Nita. (l.c.) Your Highness has the key to this trunk?

Princess. (c.) Yes       yes       you may       leave this
trunk as it is, Nita, till later. (Crosses to r.)
Go to your room and get settled; then unpack the other
trunks. I'll call you when I want you.

[21]Nita. (Going toward door r.) Yes, your Highness.
(When r., near door, stops suddenly and timidly
says) Will your Highness pardon me if I am
mistaken in thinking I recognize the Duke, your exalted
cousin, among the passengers?

Princess. (Without showing Nita that she is
startled, but audience sees it) My cousin, impossible.
He is at Madrid.

Nita. (In excellent servant style, yet knowing
she is right) Yes, your Highness. (Nita bows and
exits r., closing door.)

Princess. (Quickly fumbles with keys       selects
right one, inserts in lock, unlocks and opens lid. Just
as lid up) Are you all right, Mr. Jarvis?
(Knock at door as Princess starts to raise lid.)
Wait               (Shuts down lid again. Knock repeated. Princess
crosses and opens door l., disclosing Duke.
Exclaims in dismay) Carlos              

Duke. (Raising hat       standing in open door)
Fair cousin       if I but knew you were as pleased as
surprised at seeing me. (During speech he has entered;
takes Princess' hand and carries it to lips
and kisses it.)

Princess. Why did you leave Spain?

Duke. (Shuts door) First say you are glad to see me.

Princess. Why are you here?

Duke. (r.c.) Are you not glad to see me?

Princess. (l.c.) Why, of course, Carlos, I       I'm
always glad to see you. But why have you come to America?

Duke. Who could bring me to America but you?

Princess. How did you find me?

Duke. It wasn't easy. Spain had no attraction
for me after you left, and I followed. Is not that
true devotion? (Two long whistles. Princess gets
up confusedly as though she would not listen and
goes to window back.)

[22]Princess. (Up to window c.) Oh, come! We
are starting! Let's go out on deck       I want one last
look at America.

Duke. Thank you, cousin, I can do very well without it.

Princess. Oh, Carlos, don't be absurd! Please.
(Whistle.) We'll be gone in ten minutes. (She goes
toward door. Carlos gets up and opens it for her.
Not wanting to, Princess exits, followed by Carlos,
who closes door after him. Trunk lid raised slowly
after Princess and Duke exit.
Jarvis' head appears
and looks about. Throws back lid and stands
up. Gets cigarette and matches out of pocket, lights
and smokes. Expresses satisfaction. Lifts one leg
to step out of trunk; gets stitch in back at movement.)

Jarvis. Oh       oh       Lord! (Carries this business
at far as legitimate. With every movement getting
out of trunk finds new pain.) If I only had that
last baggage man by the neck! Oh       a       oh, Lord!
(Crosses left and drinks water.) Well, I'm all here,
most all. (Feels elbow that is evidently skinned.
Shoes are bent up from being doubled up in trunk.
Sees them.) My feet are bent. (Goes to stoop
down to get them       gets stitch in back. Drinks.)
Oh       oh       o! (Hobbles over to looking glass, then
to telephone r.) Hello       hello       give me Mr. Jarvis'
stateroom. Please       Jarvis       Warren Jarvis. No.
I don't know the number. All right. (Pause.)
Hello       Rusty? Come on up here quick and bring
me an overcoat, cap and scarf. What's that? Hold
on, I'll see. (Pause, then opens door l. and looks
at number on outside; shuts door; back to telephone)
Stateroom A       promenade deck       and bring up that
big bundle       quick, now! (Hangs up       crosses and
looks out window.) Well, good-bye, America. I
don't know when I'll see your shores again. (Shuts
trunk and sits on it.) If Rusty gets here before
[23]that Exalted Cousin returns, I'll be all right. Hm       ouch!       I
wonder what the game is? (Knock at
door.) Go away       we're all very ill. (Jarvis, uncertain
who it is, starts to hide. Door opens very
cautiously. Enter Rusty carrying bundle of trays
taken in first act.)

Rusty. (Looking over shoulder) I knows where
I'm goin', all right.

Jarvis. Come on in, Rusty.

Rusty. (Crosses to back of trunk) How did
you get on board?

Jarvis. I came in that trunk.

Rusty. You came in that trunk?

Jarvis. Did you see any signs of the police?

Rusty. No, sir.

Jarvis. Are you sure?

Rusty. Yes, sir.

Jarvis. Did you look?

Rusty. No, sir. (Handle of door r. rattles.
Jarvis to open door. Princess enters.)

Rusty. How de do, Mrs. Princess?

Princess. How do you do, Rusty? (Exclamation
c.r.) Oh, there you are! You're all right, aren't you?

Jarvis. (Rubbing sore places) Yes, I'm all right.

Princess. But your hand       you must have that attended to at once.

Jarvis. That's all right. I'll see the ship's surgeon.

Princess. Do, please.

Jarvis. (r.) You can go now, Rusty. Oh, listen!
What is the number of your stateroom?

Rusty. Number Seven twenty-nine.

Jarvis. Seven twenty-nine. Now get this: Go
there, lock yourself in, and don't talk to anyone.
You're deaf and dumb       understand?       deaf and dumb.

Rusty. I got you first. (Exit upper deck.)

[24]Princess. There is something I must tell you.
My cousin, the Duke D'Alva, is on board this boat.

Jarvis. (Whimsically) He professes to love you
devotedly.

Princess. You overheard?

Jarvis. (Pointing to trunk) The trunk. It
wasn't my idea, you know. (With feeling       yet
knowledge) You are afraid of him? Why?

Princess. Well, he is very powerful       and I may
be driven into his hands.

Jarvis. You mean       you might have to marry him?

Princess. (Looking nervously toward door c.)
Yes, if you fail.

Jarvis. (Breath being taken away) If I fail       Say,
hold on a minute! Things are coming too fast
for me. I       you       how do I              

Princess. (Interrupting) He may come back
any minute       and I don't dare tell him what happened
at the Manhattan Hotel       but he will want to
know who you are and why you are with me.

Jarvis. That's what I want to know. You forget
I am completely in the dark.

Princess. (Looking out of window) The police
can't be on board now. (Down stage.)

Jarvis. (Going to window beside her, and then
back again) You can't tell until you see who goes
ashore with the pilot. They may be working on
Rusty as a clue, but it won't lead them to anything
so long as they don't connect him with me. We'll
take no chances until we get past the danger line.
Now let's get down to business. What is the matter       and
what am I to do?

Princess. (Hesitating) I hardly know how to
begin       it seems absurd in this broad daylight to talk
of ghosts       but the fact is, my castle is haunted.

Jarvis. (Laughing) Spooks?





The Ghost Breaker
See
Page 34



Princess. (Very seriously)
Call it anything you
[25]
like, but the castle is haunted, just the same. My
grandfather was one of the wealthiest nobles in
Spain. When he died my father went to take possession
of his estate in Segura. He found the town
full of weird stories of uncanny happenings       the
castle was deserted, everyone had fled and all told
of something in armor that stalked the halls at night.

Jarvis. O-o-o-o-o-o-o-h!

Princess. My father laughed at the silly natives
and said he would go into the castle and show them
how foolish their fears were. He went, and was
never seen again.

Jarvis. (Naturally deeply interested) What happened
to him?

Princess. No one knows. He disappeared       vanished
utterly, without leaving a single clue       and the treasure's gone.

Jarvis. (More interested at word Treasure)
Treasure       what treasure?

Princess. My grandfather is known to have converted
all his wealth into Spanish gold. It amounted
to about a million dollars in your money.

Jarvis. How long ago was that?

Princess. Fifteen years ago. Since then two
other men have disappeared       just as my father did       and
now, the Duke tells me that my brother has
entered the castle. You see it runs in the blood. Up
to a week ago my brother had sent me a cable every
day, then suddenly the messages ceased. All this
week not a word. Now I know       my brother has entered
the castle, and       well, that is the end.

Jarvis. Why did you leave Spain?

Princess. A part of the legend was that a plan
had been made showing just where the treasure was
located       but this plan could never be found. Only
by accident I learned that this plan had been hidden
in the back of a locket and the locket, I discovered,
[26]had been sold and was in America. It was to find
this locket that I left my brother and came here.

Jarvis. Then my work now is to find your
brother and solve the mystery? All right! We'll
explain to the Duke that you are taking me to Spain
for no other purpose than to solve the mystery. In
America we've had trust-breakers and strike-breakers,
and now why not Jarvis, the Ghost Breaker?

Princess. Why, yes, why not? Carlos would
believe almost anything of you Americans.

Jarvis. (Whimsically) And you will tell him
you have made me a       er       what is it? A vassal?

Princess. (Almost shyly) I think not       not just yet.

Jarvis. By the way, your       er       just how should
a perfectly good vassal address his Princess?

Princess. (Hesitatingly) Highness       is correct.

Jarvis. Highness       tell me, your Highness, a vassal
doesn't amount to much, does he? I thought he was a piker.

Princess. (Mystified) A piker       a man who
carries a pike?

Jarvis. (Trying to explain) No, no       a piker is
a tin horn.

Princess. Tin horn?

Jarvis. Well, a sort of pawn in this game of
chess       along with your kings and queens and castles
and things. (Seriously, yet playfully) Could a
good, hard-working, reliable vassal work his way
up to be a Duke or a Lord, or something like that?

Princess. (Almost playing with him) You're
an ambitious vassal, aren't you? I'm afraid you
wouldn't be content with being anything less than a
king.

Jarvis. (Meaningly) A king       a prince       or a bandit.

Princess. A bandit? And why a bandit?

[27]Jarvis. A king might command       a prince request       a bandit seize.

Princess. Seize what?

Jarvis. (Daringly) That which a mere vassal
can only admire. (Knock at door. Both brought back to earth.)

Princess. There he is now.

Jarvis. Hooray!

Princess. What shall I call you?

Jarvis. (Whispering) Oh, any old thing       Warren,
Mr. Warren. (Pause. Princess crosses to
door, hesitates a moment, then opens it.)

Princess. Come in.

(Enter Duke. Stops at sight of Jarvis.)

Duke. Oh, I'm intruding. (Spoken as though
he expected Jarvis to go.)

Princess. Allow me to present Mr. Warren,
whom I am bringing from America to solve the mystery
of the castle. My cousin, Duke D'Alva. (She
crosses l.)

Jarvis. (Cross to Duke       easily) Glad to know
You. (Princess back r.)

Duke. (Patronizingly) I am honored. Interesting
task you have undertaken. May I ask if that is
your regular profession?

Jarvis. That is my business, solving mysteries,
looking up the family skeleton, hunting out spooks.
What we call in America a Ghost Breaker!

Duke. Ghost Breaker? A strange calling. I indeed
never heard of anything more extraordinary.

Jarvis. It is not surprising, your Excellency. We
are living in an age of specialists       and like every
other profession, this calls for its own peculiar training.

Princess. (Interrupting) I am so glad you are
[28]here, cousin       you will be able to tell Mr. Warren,
so much better than I, all the circumstances.

Duke. I'll be delighted to throw any light I can
on the mystery, but first tell me       (To Princess)       why
did you leave your brother to come to America?

Princess. (Takes locket from reticule) This
little locket is what brought me to America.

Duke. (Crosses to her, holding out hand to take
it) May I see it?

Princess. (Takes out memo.) No, Carlos, you
may see the locket       no one must see the memorandum.

Duke. Memorandum?

Princess. Yes.

Jarvis. (Seated on trunk       to Duke)
A wise precaution.

Duke. (Picking up locket) Curious old piece
of work       and you came all the way to America for this?

Princess. Yes.

Duke. You were very fortunate to find it so
soon. (Cross r.)

Princess. I knew where to go to find it       and yet
I was nearly too late. Think of it, after that dear
old locket had lain in an antique shop for ten years,
suddenly in one day there came two inquiries for it.
(Jarvis sits looking at Carlos.) Mine was the second.
A distinguished-looking gentleman had been
there in the morning, described it roughly to the old
man and got him to hunt for it. He had just found
it when I came in. I doubled the distinguished-looking
gentleman's offer and got it. (Another look
at Duke.) Who do you suppose wanted that locket,
Carlos?

Duke. (r., being cornered and with effort to
throw it off lightly) I see that it has already
[29]occurred to you that I am the distinguished-looking
gentleman whose offer you doubled.

Princess. (With curiosity) But how did you
learn about the memorandum, Carlos? (Jarvis sits
on trunk.)

Duke. I didn't, Cousin. I had not the slightest
suspicion that the locket contained the supposed secret.
I was merely following my pet hobby, trying
to recover some of those precious heirlooms which
have been scattered to the four winds. (Quickly)
You would be surprised, Mr. Warren, to see the
collection I have already rescued and which some
day may be yours, Maria.

Jarvis. (Breaking in impatiently) Well, so much
for the treasure. Now let's hear about the ghost.
What's your opinion of this, your Excellency? Do
you put any stock in ghosts?

Duke. Yes, Mr. Warren, I am convinced there
are such things.

Jarvis. You believe that this castle is haunted?

Duke. I know it.

Jarvis. You think this ghost is dangerous to encounter       that
it is the cause of the deaths and disappearances in the castle?

Duke. I do.

Jarvis. Well, what do you think about that?
Ghosts               That's a pretty broad term, your Excellency.
Can you tell me just what you believe this ghost is?

Duke. There are certain occult forces in this
world, Mr. Warren, that science cannot fathom, and
some of them are manifested in that castle now. A
priest might call it a demon or a fiend; a psychologist,
perhaps a returning spirit. I can't say       but I
know there is something real, a malignant force
which lurks in that castle, and while it haunts those
halls, it is madness for any man to expose himself there.

[30]Jarvis. Have you ever seen this ghost?

Princess. My brother has.

Jarvis. What?

Princess. Twice.

Jarvis. Good night!

Princess. So has my father, and the others when
they disappeared. No one has seen it three times and lived.

Jarvis. (Interrupting and looking at Duke) In
just what way do you connect this spook with the treasure?

Duke. Spook? I see no connection. What do you mean?

Jarvis. Oh, there is always money where the ghost walks.

Duke. I don't know what your experience has
been, Mr. Warren. You are evidently a brave man       but
you have yet to encounter a real ghost.

Jarvis. Brave! It takes no bravery to fight a
coward. That is what this ghost is       it's a coward
like every other ghost. I tell you that men are not
half so afraid of spirits as spirits are afraid of men.
Face the supernatural       and it is beaten to a frazzle
before the fight begins. Spooks       horse-thieves       and
peevish wild-cats can all be tamed by the same little charm.

Princess. (Mystified) Charm?

Duke. (Leaning forward) What is it?

Jarvis. I'd hate to tell you. It's part of my system.
(Taking out pistol.)

Duke. (Scornfully) I had been hoping, Mr.
Warren, that you had some subtle method of handling
this problem, but you evidently propose to meet
the forces of the supernatural with firearms. I       I
may tell you that this specter has been shot at before
without the slightest effect.

Jarvis. (Smiling) Quite likely, your Excellency.
I have seen rifle fire that had not the slightest
[31]effect on a wild-cat for the very reason that the
firing was wilder than the cat.

Duke. (As though pitying him) I am sorry for
you Mr. Warren. You will find the ghost more real than the treasure.

Princess. (Rising) But the treasure is real,
Carlos. Would I have crossed the ocean for this
locket unless I knew? Why, with this paper anybody       a
total stranger       could walk right up to the
very stone that hides it              

Jarvis. (Meaningly) Pretty dangerous paper to
have around. Look out somebody does not get there ahead of you.

Duke. (Meaningly to Jarvis) Yes, it is a dangerous
paper       if it leads anyone into the castle.

Jarvis. (Laughingly) Well, your Excellency,
I'd go a long way for the fun of unravelling a good
mystery with a little spice of danger thrown in.

Duke. You needn't have gone so far, Mr. Warren.
You are leaving a very unusual case behind
you in New York. The papers are full of it. Have
you read them? (Picking up newspaper.) It will
interest you too, Cousin. You were at the Manhattan
last night, I believe.

Princess. Yes!
(Jarvis and Princess look at
each other and Duke reads from newspaper.)

Jarvis. Why, no               (Glancing at trunk.) I
was so wrapped up in my baggage I really didn't
have a chance. (Looks at Princess.)

Duke. "Pistol duel in Manhattan Hotel. Colonel
James Marcum, a prominent and wealthy Kentuckian,
nearly met his death at five o'clock this
morning in a pistol duel in his room at the Manhattan
Hotel." (Glancing down a little further) "At
a late hour the police had no clue to the identity of
his assailant, except the remarkable fact that the
person is still hiding somewhere in the hotel."

[32]Jarvis. (Interrupting) He's probably a long way
from the hotel by this time.

Duke. (Looking at paper) They say that he
couldn't have gotten out without being seen.

Jarvis. That's the theory of the police or reporters.

Duke. What do you think?

Jarvis. He might have escaped in a thousand
ways       but that work is hardly in my line. That
belongs to the "Gum-shoes."

Duke. Gum-shoes?

Jarvis. Yes, ordinary detectives. (Enter Nita.)

Nita. Excuse, Madame              

Princess. No, Nita! Not just yet. I'll call you when I want you.

Jarvis. We are keeping you from getting settled,
I am afraid. (Cross toward door.) So, if you will
excuse me, I'll see you at luncheon, perhaps.
Hooray! I am glad to have made your acquaintance, your Excellency.

Duke. Thank you, Mr. Warren, I find you most
interesting. I shall be glad to hear more of your
remarkable profession. (Warren crosses to door
and opens it, disclosing two detectives and steward.)

Detective. Are you Miss M. T. Ar       ra       gan?

Princess. (l.c.) Yes!

Detective. You was at the Manhattan Hotel last night?

Princess. Yes.

Detective. The lock on your door was broken?

Princess. Yes.

Detective. (Removes hat) I am from headquarters,
Madame, and I have orders to clear up one
or two little matters with that affair at the hotel last night.

Duke. Orders, orders! To break in here       what headquarters?

Detective. Police headquarters.

[33]Duke. Do you know whom you are addressing?

Detective. Say       that will be about all from you!

Princess. Yes, Carlos. Please let me attend to
this matter. Won't you come in, gentlemen?

Detective. Thanks. (Realizing they are already
in the room) That's all, Steward. (Exit Steward;
enter Detectives, closing door.
Jarvis slips wounded hand into coat pocket.)

Jarvis. Yes, we were just discussing that mystery, Inspector.

Duke. You are, I take it, one of the       er       gum-shoes?
(Jarvis laughs and goes up stage.)

Detective. (Glaring angrily for a moment, walks
over toward him and shouts in his face) Gum-shoe!
Say, are you trying to be funny?

Duke. Well, sir, you are talking rather loud and
with undue asperity. I presume I have offended you.

Detective. You presume! That's a hot one!
Say, who are you, anyhow?

Duke. I am Carlos Hernando Duke D'Alva. I
have other titles, but they would hardly interest you.

Detective. Dook de Alver       and then some, eh?
Ain't that nice? Well, if you was the Archbishop
of Canterbury I'd run yer in and take yer 'shore if
yer give me any more lip! (To Princess, sucks his
teeth contemptuously and turns his back on Duke.
Produces notebook from pocket and addresses
Princess.) As you was saying when we was interrupted,
you was in the hotel when the shooting occurred. Did you hear it?

Princess. Yes, I heard two shots.

Detective. Did you hear anything else?

Princess. Yes, I heard some people running near my door.

Detective. Any one come in?

Princess. Yes, my maid was frightened and came in.

[34]Detective. Aha! How did the lock on your door get broken?

Princess. It was broken when I came. I explained
all that at the hotel.

Detective. Um       all right. What about the colored
man who came to your room and carried away a large bundle.

Princess. That was my servant. I sent for him.
They were purchases I made too late to put in my
trunk. They are here, unopened; you may examine
them if you wish.

Detective. That's all right, Miss, but what do
you know about this? (Produces knife from pocket       walks
slowly to her, examining it.) The initial on it is "W."

Princess. Did I leave that? Thank you. I'm
so glad you found it.

Detective. Then it's yours? Who is W? Your
name is Aragon, I believe.

Princess. I am Maria Theresa of Aragon.

Detective. But who is W?

Princess. Why, er, it isn't W       you had it upside
down. It is M       Maria Theresa.

Detective. That's all right, ma'am. Now there's
just one thing more.

Duke. (Cross and touch Detective on arm)
You will pardon me, but I wish to inform you that
this man's name is Warren              

Detective. (Crossing toward him) Say! Who's
conducting this inquiry, you er me?

Duke. But, my dear man              

Detective. I am not your dear man. Cut that!
You get out of here. (Forces him toward door.)

Princess. Yes, do go, Carlos. Leave us to attend
to this matter. I am sure we can finish this better without you.

Duke. I merely wished to point out              

Detective. (Interrupting and hustling Duke
[35]out) You hear what the lady says. (Second Detective
cross to Duke.) Cut it, or out yer goes,
and if ye butt in again I'll fan yer. Do you hear?
(Second Detective slaps Duke on arm, motions
him to door r.)

Duke. (At door) Infernal outrage! I shall report
this to the King!

Detective. To the King, huh? Did you get
that, Tom? Well, what do you know about that?
(Second Detective closes door.)

Jarvis. Don't be disturbed, gentlemen; he's quite
harmless. You heard him talking about the King       he
suffers from Regalmania. He has grandiose ideas.

Detective. (Aside) What does that mean, Tom?

Second Detective. (With gesture to head) Wheels.

Detective. You mean he is crazy?

Jarvis. Yes, he is at times; but he is not at all dangerous.

Detective. You lookin' out for him?

Jarvis. Yes, that's my job.

Detective. Sorry I had to be rough with him
like that, Miss, but you saw he was gumming the
game. I'm going back to New York in the pilot
boat shortly and there wasn't no time to waste. Now
just one question more. How do you account for
the blood on that knob of your door?

Princess. Blood, on my door               Why, I              

Jarvis. I think I can explain that, Inspector.

Detective. Go ahead, then.

Jarvis. (Cross c.) Allow me.

Princess. Certainly.

Jarvis. The colored man, the one you were talking
about, the one who brought the bundle, that
bundle there, carelessly broke the blade of that knife
[36]and cut his hand. That was it, wasn't it? You see
the large blade is snapped off near the handle.

Detective. Where is this colored man now?

Princess. He is in stateroom 729.

Detective. All right, I will just take a look at
him. 729? Sorry to bother you. They was the
Chief's orders. Good-bye. (Exit.)

Princess. But his hand isn't cut.

Jarvis. (Cross to 'phone) No, not yet       but it
soon will be. Hello, give me 729. (Pause.) Hello,
hello, hello, Rusty? Damn it all, answer me, do you
hear me? (Pause.) Yes, I know I did, but I am
telling you to talk now. Do just what I tell you
and do it quick. Take your knife and cut your left
hand. What? No, no, you a       damned fool, don't
cut it off, but just enough to make it bleed a little
and then tie it up with a handkerchief. Never
mind. Do it quick, and remember, don't answer
questions. You're deaf and dumb again.
(Hangs up receiver and turns to Princess.)
By gee, you're
game! You certainly buffaloed that Detective.
Then your cousin Carlos broke in at the psychological
moment to scatter their gum-shoe wits. (Laugh.)

Princess. They believe he's crazy.

Jarvis. That's just it. Now they won't listen to
him. Yes, he'll be crazy, all right. Do you think
you can handle him?

Princess. Yes, you have your hand dressed.

Jarvis. Then I'll hunt up the ship's surgeon       and
be back directly. Gee, you're game! (Cross to
door r.
Duke enters at door r.
Jarvis turns.)
Crazy! That's funny! (Jarvis exits, laughing.)

Duke. (Showing suppressed emotion, stands r.c.
glaring at Princess) Well!

Princess. Well!

Duke. Well, I'm waiting!

Princess. For what, Carlos?

[37]Duke. For some explanation. Who is this man Warren?

Princess. He is a professional ghost breaker, as
he explained.

Duke. How did you find him?

Princess. I met him quite by accident.

Duke. What do you know about him?

Princess. Why, he is as well known in America
as you are in Spain.

Duke. Indeed! (Cross to center.) Well, he will
be better known when I turn him over to the police.

Princess. Why, Carlos, what do you mean?

Duke. I think you know that which I mean,
Maria. (Detective sticks head in door.)

Detective. It's all right, Madame, but you might
have told us that your nigger was a dummy.

Duke. (To Princess) One moment, gentlemen,
one moment. (Detectives enter.) If this person
is famous, these gentlemen should know him. Do
you know Warren, the Ghost Breaker?

Detective. The what?

Duke. The Ghost Breaker!

Detective. (Both grinning) He's off again,
Tom. (Enter Jarvis.)

Duke. Now we'll see. Is this man Warren, the
Ghost Breaker? (Warren winks at Detectives.)

Detective. (To Second Detective) He's hip,
all right.

Jarvis. Agree with anything he says.

Duke. (Furiously) Answer my question       is
this man Warren, the Ghost Breaker?

Detective. Now, that's all right, Dook. Sure
he's a Ghost Breaker, ain't he, Tom?

Second Detective. Surest thing you know.

Duke. Sacristi, am I, Carlos Hernando D'Alva,
to be mocked at by two grinning, bull-necked scullions?
(Ship's officer appears in door.)

[38]Ship's Officer. Hurry up, there, if you're going
ashore with the pilot!

Detectives. (As they go through door) You're
all right, Dook, old boy! Ghost Breaker! Ha, ha!
(They exit.)

Duke. (Crossing toward door) I'll see the Captain.

Jarvis. (Back against door) I think not just yet!

CURTAIN




[39]
ACT III


Scene: The main room of an Old Spanish tavern,
Segura, Spain. Singing and mandolins heard from Wine Room.

At Rise, Maximo, an old discharged Spanish veteran,
and Gaspar, a villager, discovered playing
cards at table down c. This continues some
time. Maximo slaps down cards exultantly,
leans back in chair and laughs. Gaspar stares
peevishly at cards.

Dolores discovered gazing out of window, d.l.
Enter Vardos, old follower of Prince Basillio,
c.l., carrying basket, covered by lid or napkin.
Seeing Dolores. Spaniard on steps.

Lights full up, amber and white. Blue lights behind
in windows, r. and l.

Vardos. Still watching for a signal, Senorita?

Dolores. (Turning to Vardos) Yes, Vardos.
Have you any news?

Vardos. Nothing. Here's the basket of food untouched
as usual. This is the fifteenth night.

Dolores. Once tonight I thought I saw a light in
the tower, Vardos.

Vardos. If you did, Senorita, it was an unblessed flame.

Dolores. You haven't given up hope, have you, Vardos?

Vardos. I gave up hope when the Prince went
into the castle. Tonight I waited till an hour past
sundown, and twice I called. Once a wail came back
[40]to me. It sounded like a sigh of the damned. When
I called the second time, something moved in the turret
of the keep, like a man waving; and my heart
leaped for joy. Then, with a harsh cry, a black,
ugly bird flew from the turret straight toward where
the sun had set       on my left, mind you, the sinister
side, the left, the left! (Castanets heard off stage,
left.)

Dolores. Oh, if her Highness were only here.

Vardos. What can she do?

Dolores. She would go straight to the castle, and
will Segura have it said that they let her go alone as
they did the Prince?

Vardos. God forbid it should come to that.
(Gives basket.) Good night, Senorita. (Start for
door down r.)

Dolores. Good night       (Crosses c.)       Vardos.
You will go again tomorrow night?

Vardos. Yes, Senorita, willingly, until I know it
is useless. (Off stage voice: "Bravo, Senorita!")
Good night! (Off stage voice: "Bravo, Senorita!"
Laughing and clapping of hands. Exit c. Vardos.)

(Exit Maximo, Gaspar and Spaniard, door r.
Dolores lifts napkin and looks into basket;
crosses and exits d.r. Enter door l.c. Robledo;
stands, looks about insolently for a second.)

Robledo. Eh       hey, you, Pedro! (Receiving no
answer, he crosses to table l.c., bangs crop on table
and shouts again.) Hey, you, Pedro! What's the
matter here? Where are you? (Enter Pedro, door
r. Seeing Robledo, is immediately scared and anxious
to please.)

Pedro. Oh, Senor Robledo!

[41]Robledo. Wake up! What's the matter with you?

Pedro. One thousand pardons, Senor. What can
I do for you?

Robledo. My horse is outside; he has had a hard
ride. Wash him off, and don't give him any water
until he is cool.

Pedro. Yes, Senor, it shall be just as you say.
(Starting.)

Robledo. And leave the saddle on. I may want
to use him again.

Pedro. Yes, Senor. Yes, Senor. (Starts toward
door c. Robledo halts him.)

Robledo. Where is your daughter?

Pedro. I will call her, Senor. (He crosses to
door r., calling.) Dolores, Dolores! She will come,
Senor. She will come. (Cross to door l.c.)

Robledo. And, Pedro              

Pedro. Yes, Senor              

Robledo. If that rat-infested larder of yours is
empty, get it filled before the Duke arrives.

Pedro. The Duke coming here, Senor! When?

Robledo. Tonight! Don't stand and stare.
Hurry up and see to my horse.

Pedro. Yes, Senor. Yes, Senor. (Exit door
l.c. Dolores entering r.)

Dolores. Yes, Father? (Sees Robledo.) Oh,
it's you.

Robledo. (Pause       cross toward her) Well, well!
Can't you say you're glad to see me?

Dolores. I can, but I won't. Where's my father?

Robledo. Never mind your father. I want to talk to you.

Dolores. You do? Well, you won't in that tone.
(Start to cross left.)

Robledo. (Intercepting her c.) I won't hey?       And
why not? You little spit-fire!

Dolores. What do you want to say to me?

[42]Robledo. You little devil! (She starts away; he
grasps her wrist.) Come here! (Throws her quickly
and easily around stage l., still holding her wrist.)
Say, what's come over you these days? You are
about as fond of me and as sweet tempered as a
tigress. What have I done?

Dolores. It is what you have not done, Don Robledo.
For fifteen days your Prince has been in need
of you and you have not had the courage to go to him.
(Enter Maximo door r. and beckons
Gaspar and Villagers up.)
Let go my wrist! (Struggling.
Maximo, Gaspar and Villagers watch end
of scene.) Let go my wrist!

Robledo. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! You
can't get away. Do not try. (She strikes him, frees
herself and crosses l. to window.) You little cat,
I'll trim those claws! (Villagers laugh. Maximo
nudges Gaspar.)

Gaspar. Sh! sh! sh! Look out!

Robledo. (To them) Well, what are you laughing at?

Maximo. Why, why               (Stammering.)

Gaspar. A jest in the wine room, Senor.

Robledo. Huh! Lucky for you! Get out of my way!
(Pushes them aside and swaggers through door r.)

Dolores. Gaspar! Maximo! Come here quickly!

Maximo. (Crossing to Dolores) What is it?

Gaspar. What is the matter? (Crossing to Dolores.)

Dolores. A light! A light in the castle!

Gaspar. I thought I saw it a while ago.

Maximo. I don't see it.

Dolores. But I tell you I did see it. (She runs
r.c., calling) Father       Father       come quickly.

Pedro. (Entering r.) What is it? What are you
looking at? (Cross c.)

[43]Dolores. (l.c., pointing out window) A light       a
light in the castle. I saw it!

Pedro. (Going to window) Nombre de Dios.
(Maximo and Gaspar back to l.c.)

Dolores. (c. to Gaspar and Maximo)
Well, why don't you do something? Are you going to
stand there like scared sheep, and let a man, your
Prince, signal to you in vain?

Robledo. Who's the little devil tearing to pieces
now? (c. cross to Dolores.)

Dolores. You, Don Robledo, sword-fighter, toreador,
fire-eater, hero of a hundred duels       you       Don
Robledo       coward! (He chucks Dolores under the
chin. She throws his hand off.) I asked you to
go into the castle and rescue your Prince. I ask
you now to answer the signal that I just saw in the
tower window. Perhaps your Prince has just
crawled to that tower window where he can see our
lights. Perhaps he has burned something, a scrap
of paper, in the hope that some of you gentlemen
would notice it and come to his assistance, but he
doesn't know what cowards you are or he wouldn't
have wasted his matches. Don Robledo       coward!

Robledo. Coward, never! A fair fight in the
open and I'll meet the best man that walks the earth.
(Turns to Villagers.) Any two or three! (To
table l.)

Dolores. I don't ask you to kill one or two or
three of these poor whimpering sheep! I ask you
to dare something. (Duke enters c.) I ask you
and these gentlemen       (Point to Villagers)       to go
to the aid of your Prince       and there isn't a man
among you who dares! God, how I could love such a man!

Duke. (Down c., sarcastically to
Dolores) A pretty speech, Senorita!

Robledo. (Seeing Duke, removes hat and bows)
Your Excellency!

[44]Gaspar. The Duke D'Alva! (Villagers remove
hats and bow to Duke.)

Pedro. His Excellency!

Villagers. The Duke, His Excellency, etc.

Duke. Charming sentiments you express for
your fellow townsmen, whose healthy common-sense
prevents them from rushing to a fool's death. Still,
all fools are not dead yet. One of them will be
here tonight. And you, Senorita, will doubtless be
pleased to look upon him, as he has come all the way
from America for the privilege of entering the castle
and playing your hero.

Dolores. (To Robledo) And did her Highness
have to go all the way to America to find him?

Duke. Yes, he's from America, where all the
fools come from. (Everybody laughs but Dolores.
To Robledo) A word with you alone, Senor.

(Robledo looks at Gaspar and Maximo.
Pedro, scared, motions Villagers off to r.
Pedro, Maximo and Villagers exit door r.)

Dolores. Can I get your Excellency anything?

Duke. Don't mind me. I'll look out for myself.
Her Highness will be here very soon and will doubtless
remain here for the night. I drove ahead to prepare you.

Dolores. Yes, your Excellency! (Bowing       exit
door r.)

Duke. (Half sits on table l.,
watches Dolores off.
To Robledo) You've got work before you       Robledo.

Robledo. (Center) I'm ready, Excellency.

Duke. (Rising, across to Robledo) Yes, but this
American may be dangerous.

Robledo. In what way?

Duke. Unless he is stopped he will go into that
castle tonight       and I look upon you to stop him.
[45]He is coming here to solve the mystery and to find
the Prince. I shall endeavor to stop him, but if I
fail, Robledo, it rests with you.

Robledo. I can assure your Excellency I will convince
the American that his presence in the castle
tonight is quite unnecessary. Have you any instructions?

Duke. Any way you please, Robledo       means are
of no consequence in this world. What I want is results.
Only don't underestimate your man. He will
shoot, and I think he will shoot quick.

Robledo. Good! (Enter Pedro door r.
with tray and bottles and two glasses. Cross and put them on
table up c.)

Duke. (Taking coin from pocket) Here, take
this and have them drink to my health and that of
her Highness! (Robledo bows and exits r.)

Pedro. Is there anything else your Excellency desires?

Duke. Yes, hot water, soap and towels. (Looks at hands.)

Pedro. This way, your Excellency. (Exit Duke
and Pedro upstairs and off l.)

Robledo. (Heard off stage r.) To his Gracious
Excellency, the Duke D'Alva!

Villagers. (Off stage) The Duke! The Duke! The Duke!

(Enter Dolores r., crossing to window l.)

Robledo. Louder, you beggars, louder, or I'll
give you something to yell for!

Villagers. (Much louder) The Duke! The
Duke! Long live the Duke! The Duke! etc.

(Lights seen of automobile approaching.)

[46]Dolores. Her Highness! (Calls) Father! Father!

Pedro. (Entering) What is it, Dolores?

Dolores. Quick! Her Highness is here!

Pedro. Her Highness! (He bustles downstairs.)
Her Highness! (Calls off r.) Her Highness!

(Villagers enter door r.
Enter Princess, Nita
and Jose in motor clothes.
Princess comes c.
Jose door l.
Nita left center up stage.
Dolores l.c. Pedro right center, c.
Villagers in door r., bowing low.)

Pedro. Your Highness does my humble inn great
honor               (Villagers bow.)

Princess. Thank you. (She nods to Villagers,
extends her hand to Dolores, who carries it to
her lips, curtseying.)

Dolores. Your gracious Highness, we are ill prepared
for this great favor. Your exalted cousin
gave but short warning of your coming.

Princess. My child, any place to remove the dust
of travel will do for the present. Jose, I shall want
the car later.

Nita. (l.c.) Your Highness is not thinking of
going on to the castle tonight?

Princess. I must have news.

Nita. But you're all worn out. You're all unstrung.

Princess. When Mr. Warren comes, tell him I
will be down directly.

Dolores. I will tell the Senor American, your Highness.

Princess. Thank you. (Exit Princess and
Nita, Pedro showing them upstairs.)

(Enter Jarvis d.c.;
followed by Rusty, both carrying suitcases.
Dolores bows. Rusty comes to
[47]Dolores. Jarvis l.c.
Rusty crosses Jarvis
to l. Dolores returns bow.)

Dolores. Gentlemen       a man!

Jarvis. Rusty, we're discovered! Did you by any
chance address me, Senorita?

Dolores. I called the attention of these valiant
gentlemen of Segura to the only man who dares to
enter the castle.

Jarvis. How did you know?

Dolores. All Segura knows by this time.

(Enter Robledo door r.,
pushing through Villagers;
Dolores tries to stop him; he pushes her
aside, swaggering toward Jarvis.)

Robledo. So you're the brave American, Senor?

Jarvis. I'm an American.
(Turning to Rusty on l.)
Here's another one. (Rusty salutes.)
We're both Americans.

Robledo. And you both want to die?
(Rusty makes wry face and big eyes.)

Jarvis. (l.c.) Well, I'm not really anxious
about it, Senor.

Robledo. Better keep out of the castle, then.

Jarvis. Oh, you mean that ghost? Oh, I'm not
afraid of a little thing like that, Senor.

Robledo. No? (Turns to Dolores c.)
Well, Senorita, we gentlemen of Segura will drink to your
American. (To Jarvis) The maddest fool that
ever came to Spain! (Robledo crosses to Dolores,
chucks her under chin, laughing. Dolores throws
his hand off; motions Villagers off, and exits after
them. Jarvis and Rusty watch them off.)

Rusty. He's a nice man.

Jarvis. Pile the bags up there, Rusty. (Put bags
on table l.)

Rusty. Yas, sir.

[48]Jarvis. Looks like we were in for a warm reception.

Rusty. Yas, sir, 'tis a trifle warm. (Crosses below
table l., back to audience.)

Dolores. Pardon, Senor. Her Highness wishes
me to tell you that she will be down directly.

Jarvis. Thank you, Senorita, and who, may I
ask, was the cheerful individual that flattered me
with such a toast?

Dolores. (At c., looking after
Robledo       crosses to Jarvis) Don Robledo, Senor.

Jarvis. Don Robledo       sounds dangerous, but
doesn't mean much to me.

Dolores. It may mean much before you reach
the castle. Let me tell you something. Quick, your
hand, Senor! No, the other one. (Grasps his hand.)
I'll pretend to read your palm. Every one of those
breaks in your life-line means a moment when you
stood face to face with death, and yet, see those little
squares of protection around each break! Senor
American, there is one break which you have not yet
reached, and the protecting square is not perfect like the others.

Jarvis. I reckon that square will take care of
itself when the time comes.

Dolores. But the time is now, Senor.

Jarvis. So       and are the senorita's eyes so sharp
that she can tell the day and the hour?

Dolores. Not my eyes, Senor American, but my
ears. (Duke comes downstairs.) In all my experience
I have seen but one hand like yours       it speaks
of danger, and that hand belongs to Don Robledo.

Duke. (Still on stairs) Well, Mr. Warren!

Dolores. Pardon, Senor! (Curtsies to Jarvis
and steps back from him.)

Jarvis. Good-bye, Senorita. Many thanks for
your occult wisdom. I'll take good care of that little
[49]square. (Dolores crosses, bows to Duke, exits r.,
closing door.)





The Ghost Breaker

Page 46



Duke. (Coming down) Well, Mr. Warren,
looking into the future? (Lays coat on table c.
Jarvis l.c.)

Jarvis. Yes, Duke. The immediate future promises
to be very interesting. A dark man is to cross my path.

Duke. (r.c.) Do you believe in such foolery?

Jarvis. I like to, on this occasion, for I hope it
means someone I very much want to meet.

Duke. Mr. Warren, I feel a certain responsibility
for Her Highness' actions, and the prospect of
your death tonight is most uncomfortable.

Jarvis. You think I won't come back?

Duke. I think if you go to that castle tonight you
take your life in your hands.

Jarvis. I've got a pretty good grip.

Duke. Look here. You Americans are shrewd
traders. You get dollar for dollar when you bargain.
You are not giving away your life for nothing.
Now, what was the price?

Jarvis. Oh, not very much. The deal was made
on bargain day. My life happened to be a little below par.

Duke. Very well, I will release you from your
end of the bargain.

Jarvis. Your Excellency, I am overwhelmed, but
the price is paid and we're on the job, aren't we, Rusty?

Rusty. Yas, sir, we most certainly is!

Duke. I suppose that means that you will keep
faith with Her Highness?

Jarvis. Yes.

Duke. I never saw a man quite so anxious to be
killed; but there it is: Fools rush in where angels
fear to tread.

[50]Jarvis. I'd rather be an energetic fool than an
angel with cold feet.

Duke. I am sorry for you.

Jarvis. (Crossing to Duke) Your Excellency,
I decline your offer and your advice and your sympathy,
and I'll tell you why. I once saw a gambler
lay down four aces. Just think of it: four fat aces.
He looked the dealer straight in the eye and said:
"The play ain't natural." Now, you tried to have
me arrested on the steamer, you have tried to block
me in every move I have made. Now, all of a sudden
you express the utmost anxiety as to what's going
to happen to me in the castle. You even offer
to buy me off. You advise me to stay out. Shall I
take your advice? No. "The play ain't natural."

Duke. You have intruded into a matter which
you neither understand nor appreciate. If, as you
say, the play seems unnatural, throw the cards and
stay out of the game.

Jarvis. No, I'll stay right in the game, but I am
going to watch the dealer. Well, come along, Rusty.
(Cross to Rusty.) Let's see if we can find the
landlord. (Picking up bags.)

Rusty. I'd like to find a piece of chicken.

Jarvis. Chicken, Rusty? What put that in your head?

Rusty. I's powerful hungry, Marse Warren.

Jarvis. What       again?

Rusty. No, sir       it's the same old hunger.

Jarvis. Well, Rusty, you are not going to get
anything to eat until we finish the job.

Rusty. Good Lord, have I got to wait till you're
dead before I eat? (They start with bags to cross
to stairway. Enter Princess on stairs.)

Duke. Well, all Segura will be buzzing with
your ghost hunt tonight. The whole town will sit
up to hear of the outcome.

[51]Jarvis. And where are you going to get the returns, Duke?

Duke. Unfortunately, I must leave at once. I
have an urgent summons to Madrid.

Jarvis. Well, that's too bad. I'm sorry you're
leaving us. Won't you even be around at the finish, your Excellency?

Duke. I am sorry, Mr. Warren, but I must go.

Jarvis. Well, I call that a shame.

Princess. (Coming downstairs       to Pedro
entering r.) Pedro, this is Mr. Warren. Attend to his
wants.

Pedro. (Bowing) Yes, your Highness! (Princess
crosses l.c. Pedro goes upstairs.) This way.
(Jarvis and Rusty following Pedro upstairs.)

Jarvis. Your Highness, I'd like a couple of good
horses and two good lanterns.

Princess. Pedro.

Pedro. Yes, your Highness. (Pedro exits.)

Duke. Lanterns? Looking for an honest man,
Mr. Warren? (c. Lays hat on table c.)

Jarvis. (Over banister) Not in this neck of the
woods, your Excellency.
(Exit Jarvis and Rusty.)

Princess. Carlos, what news of my brother have you heard?

Duke. (l.c.) Nothing, Maria.

Princess. And yet you are leaving for Madrid.

Duke. The message is from His Majesty.

Princess. But why must you go so soon?

Duke. You know my ride is a long one.

Princess. But, Carlos, my brother may be dying,
dead       and yet you have not the time and the courage
to help me find him.

Duke. What need of me? You have your Ghost Breaker.

Princess. So, Carlos, that is your excuse?

Duke. I make no excuse, Maria. I need none.
That Yankee adventurer stands between you and
[52]me. Send him away, and I will do anything you
ask. I'll put off my journey now to the King. I'll
send one of my men into the castle to find your brother.

Princess. Yes, you will send one of your men       but
you are not brave enough to go there yourself.
Yet you ask me to send away this man who of all is
willing to sacrifice even his life for me.

Duke. If he stays, I'll go.

Princess. Very well, then you force me to
choose. I do. I choose a man.

Duke. You love him?

Princess. Perhaps. (r. Turns away.)

Duke. Well, Maria, you are sending him to his
death. (Enter Jarvis on stairs.) Success to you,
Mr. Ghost Breaker, when you beard the spectre in
his den. (Takes hat and coat from table.)

Jarvis. (Coming downstairs) Thank you, your
Excellency. (With mock dignity) I'll do my best.
(Changes expression.) To put salt on the spectre's tail.

Duke. Good-bye! (Exit l.c.)

Jarvis. Good-bye.

Princess. (c.) Mr. Warren, we must start at once.

Jarvis. Courage       if your brother is there, I'll
find him. You must be patient and remain here
where you are safe, and try to rest.

Princess. I cannot rest until I know what has
happened to him. I shall go mad if I am left alone.

Jarvis. But it is not safe for you to go.

Princess. Nevertheless, Mr. Warren, I will go
to my brother tonight.

Jarvis. Now, my dear child! (Pause.) I beg
your pardon, but please       oh, please let me insist on one condition.

Princess. Name it.

[53]Jarvis. Let me go ahead and look over the
ground. I will signal when it is safe to follow.

Princess. How can you signal?

Jarvis. With a light       (Cross to window l.)       from
one of those towers. You can see it from here.
You won't have long to wait. It will shine within an hour.

Princess. (l.c.) But if you       if it does not shine?

Jarvis. Well, then I'll be too busy swapping lead
for brimstone with Mr. Spook to stop and hang a lantern.

Princess. Oh, but you are brave! You must
have the locket with the memorandum. (Start to stairs.)

Jarvis. Yes, of course, where is it?

Princess. It's in my room. I won't be long.
(On stairs.)

Jarvis. Suppose you give me that, and we'll start at once.

Princess. Very well. (Exit upstairs and off.)

Jarvis. (Calling) Rusty! Oh, Rusty!

Rusty. (Off) Yas, sir! Yas, sir!

Jarvis. Bring down my hat and coat. We're starting.

Rusty. Yas, sir.

Jarvis. (l.c.) I wouldn't change places with
that spook for all the gold       (Enter Rusty)       that
she thinks is in that castle. (Rusty comes down
with hat and coat.) Oh, don't hurry like that, Rusty       I
hate to see you hurry.

Rusty. (On bottom step) I smell something
cooking       smells like a Spanish pork chop. (Gives
hat and coat to Jarvis.)

Princess. (Calling from upstairs) Mr. Warren       Mr.
Warren               (Darts up steps; is met half-way
by Princess.) Mr. Warren              

Jarvis. Well?

[54]Princess. The locket!

Jarvis. The locket gone?

Princess. Yes.

Jarvis. And the memorandum?

Princess. Gone, too.

Jarvis. Quick, Rusty! The horses!

Rusty. Yas, sir.

Jarvis. We've no time to lose.

Rusty. Yas, sir. (Exits.)

Jarvis. (Both on stairs) Your Highness, I've
struck the first trail of the spook that is haunting your castle.

Princess. You think              

Jarvis. I think your cousin has not gone to Madrid.
Time is everything now.

Princess. You know the way?

Jarvis. North road       second turn to the right.

Princess. Yes, that leads to the postern gate.

(Enter Robledo       stands in arch under stairs, revolver
drawn.)

Jarvis. I understand. (Starting.)

Princess. Wait! This little cross! Will you
wear it for me tonight? (Slips chain over Jarvis'
head. Robledo looks up and steps back in alcove.)

Jarvis. Only for tonight?

Princess. You may never see tomorrow.

Jarvis. If I don't see you tomorrow, forgive me
for telling you tonight that I love you. (Raises hand
to stop her reply.) Don't rebuke me tonight. Wait
until tomorrow, if tomorrow ever comes. (Pause.)
And now your humble vassal goes forth in his lady's
cause       and while all Segura waits, ghosts and Ghost
Breaker shall stalk those halls. Your Highness,
within the hour I will hang your signal from the
castle. (Carries her hands to his lips.)

Princess. God be with you! (Exits upstairs.)

[55]Jarvis. (Watching her off) Highness.       Highness               (Starts
to go. Robledo cocks revolver.
Jarvis stops, listens, looks around, starts to fold
coat, whistles "Dixie," moves downstairs until near
lamp, throws coat at lamp       lights out. Pause. Two
shots are fired in the dark.
Jarvis crosses left c.
Robledo crosses down r.c., falls on second shot.
Pause. Jarvis whistles "Dixie."
Exits door l.c.)

CURTAIN



[56]
ACT IV


Scene: The Hall of the Knights, in the haunted
castle. On walls a few old weapons, thick dust
everywhere. Moonlight streams through round
window high in wall r., striking picture. Curtain
rises slowly while orchestra plays "I
Dreamed I Dwelt in Marble Halls." Wind
moans through grated windows, rats squeal and
cross moonlight on floor; light flickers on tower wall.

(Enter Jarvis from door l.
with lantern unlit       turns and calls cautiously.)

Jarvis. Come on in, Rusty. (Enter Rusty with
lighted lantern.) They've been in this room. Do
you smell that, Rusty? (Cross r.)

Rusty. (l.c.) Marse Warren, I'm so scared I
can't smell nothin'.

Jarvis. The room's full of it       somebody's been
carrying a smoky lantern. (Dull thud off left.)

Rusty. Good God Almighty, what's that? (Jarvis
crosses r.c. over table, lights lantern and then
stands looking around room.) I want to go home!
(Put lantern down c.)

Jarvis. (Looking about) We've been in this room before.

Rusty. Is this where that poundin' came from?
(Cross c. to Jarvis.)

Jarvis. I reckon that pounding and the smoky
lanterns went together. (Rusty[57]
sees armor on
stairs; backs into Jarvis and sinks to knees; head on
floor.)





The Ghost Breaker

Page 62



Rusty. O               oh!

Jarvis. (Whirls with gun drawn) What's the matter?

Rusty. (Pointing to armor on stairs) Look       look       look
at them big black things       see 'em standin' there?

Jarvis. (Laughing; putting away gun) These
are the same black things that scared you before       don't
you remember?

Rusty. I'm so scared I can't remember anything!

Jarvis. They're nothing but suits of armor. Get
up on your pins and don't you bump me again.
(Rusty rises.) The next one of those rear-end collisions
and I'm liable to let some moonlight into you.
You've been treading on my heels ever since we
came in here, and when I stop you bump into me.

Rusty. I'm powerful scared I might lose you!

Jarvis. A fine chance! (Looking about.) Well,
Rusty, we've been through this old castle pretty
thoroughly now, from dungeon to tower, and not a
sign of the Prince or the Duke or any one else, unless
they pound or carry a smoky lantern. It's a
clue, Rusty, it's a clue. We'll stick right here till
we find out where it leads. I'll swear the Duke
never went to Madrid, but came straight here from the inn.
(Jarvis crosses to fireplace r.
Rusty follows.)
Get away from me. (Strikes a match and
holds in chimney.) There's a fine chance for a fire.
Good, it draws. The chimney's clear. Now, then,
bust up the table and start a fire.

Rusty. How can I break it? Oh, it's rotten!

Jarvis. You won't feel half so scared with a good
blaze behind you. (Rusty picks up pieces of table.)
I'll scout around a bit.

[58]Rusty. (Drops pieces of table) Don't you do no
scoutin' outside this room!

Jarvis. Well, come on, Rusty       get busy and
build that fire.

Rusty. (Dropping to floor and begins fussing
with foot) Just as soon as I get this here shoe off.

Jarvis. (Looking at him) What's the matter
with your shoes? (Cross l.c.)

Rusty. 'Tain't my shoe       it's my foot. You
know I was holdin' them horses and waitin' and
waitin' for you to come out. Dem guns went off
and all dem horses jumped right on me.

Jarvis. There were only two horses, Rusty.

Rusty. I was countin' their feet.

Jarvis. Well, tie up your shoe and get busy.
(Looking around.)

Rusty. Yas, sir. (Rises, picks up pieces of
table, crosses to fireplace.)

Jarvis. This room was probably used as a banquet hall.

Rusty. (Gathering up few pieces of table and
taking them to fireplace, puts them on fire; looks
up) Yeah       when we goin' to eat?

Jarvis. Not till we have finished this job.

Rusty. (Putting pieces of table on fire       still at
fireplace, back to audience) Tuesday       Wednesday       Thursday               Ah
can't wait no longer than Saturday.
(Strikes match and lights fire. Glow from fire.)

Jarvis. (Runs up steps at back, looking left)
That way leads through those two long rooms to the postern gate.

Rusty. (Looking up) That's where that black
thing followed me.
(Crosses to Jarvis l.c. slowly.)

Jarvis. Well, a black thing followed me, treading
on my heels every step I've taken.

Rusty. Oh, I couldn't see where I was steppin'.

[59]Jarvis. (Looking about) That goes to the Armory.

Rusty. (l.c. Jarvis on steps)
Ah seen eyes in
there, and a cold, grimy, green, slimy smell in there.
Ain't that where that broad-faced bird flew at me
and I fell down them slippery stairs?

Jarvis. (Laughing) That broad-faced bird was
an owl, Rusty       just a common, ordinary owl. You know what an owl is.

Rusty. O       ooh       ooh!

Jarvis. (Sees door r.c.) Where can that door
lead to? That's it. (Jarvis goes to the door in
r.c. Steps on trap and falls suddenly.) Wow!
That was a close one. (Lantern goes out.)

Rusty. (Advancing) Lord, Marse Warren,
what is it? (Starts up to Jarvis.)

Jarvis. Get back! Give me that lantern.
(Rusty hands lantern.)
Give me your hand. Can you hold me?
(Rusty holds out hand and Jarvis cautiously
steps on trap door; it sinks and other end rises.)
God! I thought so. Water and a long drop! No
wonder people disappear in this castle. Good Lord,
what if her brother went down there? Rusty, whatever
happens, keep clear of this. If you step on this
you will never see Kentucky again for sure.
(Groan heard off left.)

Rusty. Did you hear that groan?
(Wind changes to low moan.)

Jarvis. Groan               There it is again. It sounded
just like a man.

Rusty. Ough! Ough!

Jarvis. Shut up! (Crosses to l.c.)

Rusty. Marse Warren       look out!

Jarvis. Listen! (Crosses and stands moment at
door. Wind moans.) I guess it's the wind. (He
crosses to fireplace.) This place is getting on my nerves.

Rusty. (r.c.) That wasn't no wind, Marse
[60]Warren. Ah hope to die if that wasn't a sure
enough human groan. (He looks at picture l.)
And Ah want to tell you som'pin' else. Have you
ever been in church or somewhere and all of a sudden
a feelin' come over you that there was eyes a-starin'
at the back of your head? You just knowed
it       until you couldn't stand it no longer, and just
turned around and see who it was?

Jarvis. Why, yes, Rusty, I have had that happen. Why?

Rusty. That's just the way I feel now, like there
was eyes a-lookin' at me. (Turns to picture.) You
see that picture? Seems like that feller was lookin'
at me       like he'd step right out of the frame. (He
points to armor on steps.) Or them two battleship
boogies       just jump right down here.

Jarvis. It's been a good many years since those
boys jumped, Rusty. (Noise off stage of running.)
Hark! Listen! (He crosses to l.c., pistol drawn;
stands listening.) Somebody's running       coming this
way               (Dull thud at back.)

Rusty. I want to go home!

Jarvis. What do you know about that?

Rusty. I don't want to know nothin' about it.

Jarvis. I thought so.

Rusty. What is it?

Jarvis. The man with a smoky lantern has been
up those stairs.

Rusty. You ain't goin' up there, is you?

Jarvis. I am not       because the Duke or some of
his men are probably waiting for me at the top of
the stairs with a big long gun, and I'm no book hero.

Rusty. Suppose it's the Prince?

Jarvis. Well, suppose it is the Prince. He might
blow my head off, because he doesn't know what I
came here for       and if it's someone else, they'll blow
my head off, because they do know.

Rusty. (Looks at ceiling and following supposed
[61]sounds with head r.c.) Sounds like somebody was
runnin' round.

Jarvis. (c.) They're trying to scare us, Rusty.
They're probably watching every move we make.
That's where that pounding comes from. Why don't
they shoot? They're trying to scare us, like they
did the poor boobs down in the village. (Rusty
crosses to fireplace.) They want to get us out of
here. They want to get us out of this room. Rusty,
someone was working in the room. Now, where
was he working? Where was he              

Rusty. (Meanwhile has crossed to mantel and
picked up hammer and chisel) Look here, Marse
Warren       look y'ere! (A few steps from fireplace.)

Jarvis. (Crossing to Rusty) What is it, Rusty?

Rusty. (Handing them to Jarvis) Look at them.

Jarvis. Where did you find them, Rusty?

Rusty. (Pointing to mantel) Up there.

Jarvis. Good boy, Rusty! Now I'll tell you
something. These are his tools. Someone was working
in this room, so we've beaten him to it. Now,
where was he working? (Hands on floor.) Mortar
on floor. (Hands on mantel.) Mortar on the
mantel              
(Puts down tools, looking up and pointing.)
Look at that! That's where he was working,
Rusty, and we've beat him to it       we've beat him!

(Long pause. Both turn simultaneously and look at
picture. Jarvis draws revolver.
Rusty turns to
Jarvis and sees that he looks at picture.)

Rusty. (Scared voice) Did you feel that, too?

(Jarvis crosses slowly and cautiously to picture;
feels all around picture and lights a match to examine
it; passes light all around frame.)

Jarvis. (Backing away) By God, that's weird!
You could feel that just as plain              
(Backs to
steps and sits on balustrade, over which figure in armor
is standing.) By God, that's weird! (In awed
[62]voice. Figure in armor raises sword slowly directly
behind Jarvis.)

Rusty. (Looking at picture) It sure is, Marse
Warren, it sure is               (Rusty turns just in time
to see sword raised above Jarvis' head; screams)
Look out! (Ducks behind table in turret r. Fight
then takes place between figure in armor and Jarvis.
Figure finally gets on trap r.c. and disappears
out of sight.) Where is he? (From behind hiding-place.)

Jarvis. Water and a long drop. There's another
of the Duke's men gone to hell.

Rusty. I knowed them battleship boogies was spooks.

Jarvis. (Picks up sword man in armor dropped;
c.) We'll just take a look at this other fellow. (He
goes to make a swipe at figure on other side of stairs       sees
Rusty.) What's the matter? Are you scared?

Rusty. You can't scare me       I'm scared already.

(Jarvis makes feint at figure. No response; feints
again, as though to strike, meaning to draw man
out if he is in armor; no response; goes up
steps, knocks armor over.)

Jarvis. I guess he's harmless. (Drops sword at
foot of steps.)

Rusty. A       ah! (Running up steps and picking
up armor.) I'll just fix him so he won't jump no
more! (Cross to trap.)

Jarvis. What are you going to do?

Rusty. I'm going to sink this other battleship!

Jarvis. Hold on       wait a minute. I reckon we
can use that. It takes a thief to catch a thief, they
say. We'll just outspook Mr. Ghost. Now, come
on, Rusty. Get into this hardware as fast as you can.

[63]Rusty. Marse Warren, I don't want to be no spook!

Jarvis. Listen! Somebody was working in this
room. It's a cinch that the treasure is here, and it's
a bigger cinch he'll come back to get it when we've gone.

Rusty. You ain't going to leave me here alone?

Jarvis. Sure, I'm going to put you in this, so
you can watch. I'm going to make a bluff that we're
both gone. You'll be as safe as a church in this.
No one would ever think of looking for one of us in
this armor. You watch, and when he starts to work,
then yell your head off.

Rusty. I'll yell so loud they will hear me in Kentucky.

Jarvis. You give your best yell, and then I'll nail him.

Rusty. If you don't nail him       he'll nail me!

(Business Jarvis putting armor on Rusty.
Breastplate, back and legs are put on together; belt fastened
around waist first, then legs; next collar; then
arms; last helmet; this done during the following dialogue.)

Rusty. Marse Warren, you must think a heap
of Miss Princess to go prowling around in this boogy
house in the dark.

Jarvis. What makes you think that?

Rusty. Marse Warren, I knowed you since you was a baby.

Jarvis. What's that got to do with it?

Rusty. She 'gin you that jewelry that's hanging
round your neck, didn't she? She's kind of crazy
about you, too, ain't she?

Jarvis. How do you know?

Rusty. Aw       I know, all right.

Jarvis. But how do you know?

Rusty. Waal, I'm goin' to tell you, and then
[64]you'll know how I know. Just before them horses
all jumped on me, when I was waitin' for you in the
road, I heard a window go up, slap, and there was
the Princess a-lookin' at the moon, just like a picture
in the moonlight; just a-lookin' at the moon,
and she says       she says              

Jarvis. What did she say?

Rusty. Well, no lady never talks that way at the
moon unless she's in love.

Jarvis. What did she say?

Rusty. She says       looking at the moon, she says,
"The world has begun all over again for me." And
then she went right on and says, "God be with you,
my American!" I'm the only American around here
'cept you, Marse Warren.

Jarvis. You heard her say that? God bless you
for that, Rusty! (With helmet in hand.) Here, put
your head into this Stetson.

Rusty. Oh! Oh!

Jarvis. What's the matter?

Rusty. Full of spider webs.

(Jarvis puts helmet
on again.)

Jarvis. Gloves       here. How do you feel?

Rusty. All in. Do I look like a spook?

Jarvis. You're a wonderful sight! (Pushing
him away.) Now, Rusty, get over here. Where is
your sword? (Jarvis down steps;
Rusty sneezes.)
I never heard of a ghost sneezing before.

Rusty. Marse Warren, I'm catching cold.

Jarvis. (Up steps to Rusty) Now, Rusty, keep
your ears and eyes open. Don't move a muscle. If
any one comes, yell your head off, but don't sneeze.

Rusty. Marse Warren, I want to go home!

Jarvis. We haven't any home, Rusty.

Rusty. Marse Warren, I don't ever expect to get
out of this boogy house nohow. (Call is heard off
stage l.)

Jarvis. Well, Rusty, there is something.
(Faint
[65]call heard; very indistinct.) What's that? I'd almost
swear that was a call or a groan. (Another
call; Jarvis blows out lantern.)
There it is again.
(Light is thrown on door as by someone carrying
lantern. Pause.) Hark! Listen! There's a light,
Rusty. It's coming this way. It's coming, Rusty!
It's coming back. Remember the high sign, Rusty,
and don't sneeze.

(Jarvis hides above door l.
Enter Dolores and the Princess
and Maximo carrying
lantern d.l., cautiously coming forward.)

Dolores. No one here either, your Highness.
(Cross stage r.c.)

Princess. (c.) We must go on, Dolores. We
must find him before it's too late. Oh, I never will
forgive myself for sending him to this dreadful place!

Dolores. (Cross to fire) Look! Here is a fire.
They've been in this room. (Maximo comes across
at back with lighted lantern to r.c.)

Princess. Perhaps they have already been killed.

Jarvis. Your Highness! (l.c.)

Princess. Mr. Warren       Mr. Warren! Thank
God you are still alive!

Jarvis. Your Highness       it's madness for you to
come to this place. How did you get here?

Princess. (Crossing toward him) Heaven only
knows. We have been wandering through this
dreadful place for hours, calling to you       trying to
find you before it was too late.

Jarvis. Too late? What do you mean?

Princess. My brother is safe, thank God!

Jarvis. Where is he?

Princess. On his way to get help from the King.

Jarvis. Where has he been?

Princess. Right here in this castle, a prisoner       since
the day he entered.

Jarvis. A prisoner?

Princess. Yes, he succeeded in making his
[66]escape tonight, and has gone direct to the King for help.

Jarvis. How did you learn this?

Dolores. (c.) From Robledo. Your bullet went
straight, Senor. He is dying. He confessed to the
Holy Father. I promised to be with him at the end. (Weeps.)

Jarvis. (Crosses to Dolores, c.)
The end               (Realizing
Dolores cared for Robledo.) Then       you               I
didn't know. I might have               I'm sorry.

Dolores. 'Tis better so, Senor. My Prince still
lives. (Jarvis steps back c.)

Princess. (Cross to Dolores) Oh, Dolores, my
poor child! Maximo, take her back to the inn as
quietly as possible. (They exit.) Oh, Mr. Warren,
let us leave this dreadful place!

Jarvis. Not I, your Highness. You go with
them, and wait for me at the inn.

Princess. You cannot persuade me again, Mr.
Warren. I will remain.

Jarvis. Please.

Princess. Return with us, then.

Jarvis. Your Highness, I promised to solve the
mystery of this castle and to find the treasure. My
task is an easy one now.

Princess. Then I will share it with you.

Jarvis. And you groped your way through this
old castle to find me. You are game.

Princess. You faced death, perhaps, for me.

Jarvis. You're trembling       you're frightened       you're
cold       your hands are cold!

Princess. Oh, I'm not              

(Jarvis takes Princess
to fire; she sits.)

Jarvis. Come over here. You must have been
scared to death prowling through the blackness.

Princess. Every nerve of my body is on edge
with the happenings of this dreadful place!

[67]Jarvis. Oh, don't cry! Go on, then       cry       cry       cry
some more. Just forget you are a Princess and
cry, that's it. That's fine. I'll round up this spook
tonight for good, and then the vassal's task is done.
His fate is in your hands, Highness. What's to become
of him? (Love scene.) Don't send me away.
I've loved you from the first, and I shall always love
you. I'm no Prince or Duke. I know I'm just a
plain American citizen, a man       and all the man in
me cries out that I love you! Don't send me away.

Princess. You must go.

Jarvis. You're going to send me away?

Princess. Yes, you must leave Spain. Your life
would never be safe here. (Duke sneezes from
behind picture.)

Princess. What was that? (She goes to lower
end of fireplace; Jarvis r.c.)

Jarvis. Oh, see, that       that's Rusty.

Princess. That would frighten anyone.

Jarvis. I figured that I might need a ghost myself,
but Rusty disobeyed orders. Rusty, I told you not to sneeze.

Rusty. Dat was somebody else, Marse Warren!
I didn't sneeze!

Princess. Mr. Warren.

Jarvis. Don't move. Your Highness, I've got
your ghost at last. (Pointing gun at picture.)
There is somebody behind that picture! Come out,
or I'll shoot you full of holes.

Duke. (Lights at window change to red. Duke
coming out) Don't shoot.

Jarvis. (c.) Your Excellency, you're a long way
from Madrid.

Duke. Madrid               You fool, you have fallen
right into the trap. (Crosses c.) What I have done
has been for your sake, Maria. I purposely deceived
him, so that I might get here ahead of him and
[68]watch. See, there are his tools. (Crosses r.) And
you yourself interrupted him at his work. (Points over mantel.)

Jarvis. That's an unlucky gesture. How did you
know the treasure was there?

Duke. That's where you were working.

Jarvis. You forgot I have never seen the memorandum.

Duke. Until you stole it. Can't you see, Maria?

Princess. Yes, one of you two stole the locket.

Jarvis. Which one of us two? (Walking over
to Duke.) You can't lie yourself out of this. Twice
tonight you tried to have me murdered. Why didn't
you have the nerve to come out in the open? I told
you all ghosts were cowards       but you haven't got
the courage of a rabbit. If it weren't for her, I'd
blow your damned head off, and send you down
after that other poor devil! You've got him to answer
for, sooner or later. Now, see here       give me
that locket               No, give her the locket       or, by the
living God, I'll break your               Come on!

Princess. (Light outside and first border and
foots change to amber) Carlos!

Duke. (Cross to c. and
Princess; gives locket)
You play a good game, Mr. Warren. Are all Americans like you?

Jarvis. They all play the game in Kentucky.

Duke. (Cross to door l.) And I thought all
Americans were fools.

Jarvis. I saw that from the first, and it helped.

Duke. Mr. Warren, take her advice, and return
to Kentucky. (Exit l.)

Jarvis. Say, hold on              

Princess. (Stopping Jarvis c.)
What kind of a place is Kentucky?

Jarvis. God's good country, lady. Must I go back alone?

[69]Princess. You must go, but you need not go
alone.

Jarvis. You mean              ? Say it! Say it!

Princess. I love you! (They embrace.)

STAGE MANAGER'S PLOT


Act I       
Manhattan Hotel at five o'clock in the morning.
Stage dimly lighted by night lamp from side of
bed. Theresa is sleeping. Modern, up-to-date
hotel room. Furniture dark and a general atmosphere
of the best.

Act II       
Stateroom on S.S. "Aquitania," with doors leading
off to bath and bedroom of the suite. White
walls, dark plush hangings and gold furniture.
Dark carpet. Atmosphere of a liner just before
leaving dock.

Act III       
An old Spanish tavern on the outskirts of
Segura with a suggestion of past refinement,
but now in a condition of decay. Mandolin
and guitar heard in wine room at opening, with
singing.

ACT IV       
An old Spanish castle, deserted, crumbling, covered
with the dust of ages. Wind effect, etc.,
to create an atmosphere of spookiness at rise.

The House Detective in the First Act doubles
Pedro, the innkeeper, in the Third Act.

Hotel Porter in First Act doubles Vardos in Third
Act. Also can do the fight in armor.

Steward in Second Act doubles Jose in Third Act.

Maximo and Gaspar are unimportant characters
in the opening of the Third and can be played by
extras.

Clarence

Comedy in 4 acts by Booth Tarkington. 5 males, 5 females. 2
interiors. Costumes, modern. Plays 2         hours.

One of the "five million", Clarence served where he was sent       though
it was no further than Texas. As an entomologist he
found       on this side of the ocean       no field for his specialty, so
they set him to driving mules.

Now, reduced to civil life and seeking a job, he finds a position
in the home of one Wheeler, a wealthy man with a family.
And because he'd "been in the army" he becomes guide, philosopher
and friend to the members of that distracted family
group. Clarence's position is an anomolous one. He mends the
plumbing, tunes the piano, types       off stage       and plays the saxophone.
And around him revolves such a group of characters
as only Booth Tarkington could offer. It is a real American
comedy, at which the audience ripples with appreciative and
delighted laughter.

Those marvelous young people, Cora and Bobby, are portrait
sketches warranted to appeal to everyone.

Royalty, $25.00. Price, 75 cents.


The Charm School

Comedy in 3 acts by Alice Duer Miller and Robert Milton.
6 males, 10 females. (May be played by 5 males and 8 females).
(Any number of school girls may be used in the ensembles).
2 interiors. Costumes, modern. Plays 2         hours.

A young automobile salesman just out of his 'teens inherits a
girl's school and insists on running it himself, according to his
own ideas, chief of which is that the dominant feature in the
education of the young girl of today should be CHARM.

In the end the young man gives up the school and promises
to wait until the youngest of his pupils reaches a marriagable
age.

"The Charm School" has the freshness of youth, the inspiration
of a novel idea, the charm of originality, and wholesome,
amusing entertainment. We strongly recommend it for high
school production.

First produced in New York, then toured the country. Two
companies now playing it in England. Royalty, $25.00. Price,
75 cents.

A Full House

Farcical comedy in 3 acts. By Fred Jackson. 7 males, 7
females. 1 interior. Modern costumes. Plays 2         hours. This
newest and funniest farce was written by Fred Jackson, the
well-known story writer, and is backed up by the prestige of
an impressive New York success and the promise of unlimited
fun presented in the most attractive form. A cleverer farce
has not been seen for many a long day. "A Full House" is a
house full of laughs. Royalty, $25. Price, 75 cents.

The Famous Mrs. Fair


A play in 4 acts. By James Forbes, author of "The Commuters",
"The Traveling Salesman", etc. 3 males, 10 females.
2 interiors. Costumes modern. Plays 2         hours.

Mrs. Fair was a major abroad and won a medal for bravery.
Her husband was displeased when Mrs. Fair came home to a
fame which lifted her out of his life. The dissatisfaction grew
as she became absorbed in public functions. Mr. Forbes traces
the widening of the rift between husband and wife with great
skill in the first two acts. These are light comedy. In the third
the mood becomes serious and we find that Mrs. Fair's absence
from home has set the husband to philandering and the daughter
to intimacy with a gay set. Indeed, only through the joint
efforts of husband and wife to save the girl from danger, is
harmony again established.

A true comedy, written with keen insight. Royalty, $35.00.
Price, 75 cents.


Nothing But the Truth

Comedy in 3 acts. By James Montgomery. 5 males, 6 females.
Costumes, modern. 2 interiors. Plays 2         hours.

Is it possible to tell the absolute truth       even for twenty-four
hours? It is       at least Bob Bennett, hero or "Nothing But
the Truth", accomplished the feat. The bet he made with his
business partners, and the trouble he got into is the subject of
William Collier's tremendous comedy hit. "Nothing But the
Truth" can be whole-heartedly recommended as one of the
most sprightly, amusing and popular comedies. Royalty, $25.00.
Price, 60 cents.

On the Hiring Line

Comedy in 3 acts, by Harvey O'Higgins and Harriet Ford.
5 males, 4 females. 1 interior. Costumes, modern. Plays 2        
hours.

Sherman Fessenden, unable to induce servants to remain at
his Jersey home, hits upon the expedient of engaging detectives
as domestics.

His second wife, an actress, weary of the country, has succeeded
in discouraging every other cook and butler against
remaining long, believing that she will convince her husband
that country life is dead. So she is deeply disappointed when
she finds she cannot discourage the new servants.

The sleuths, believing they are called to report on those living
with the Fessendens, warn Fessenden that his wife has been
receiving love-notes from an actor friend, and that his daughter
is planning to elope with a supposed thief.

One sleuth causes an uproar making a mess of the situations
he has witnessed. Fessenden, however, has learned a lesson
and is willing to leave the servant problem to his wife.

Enjoyed long runs in New York and Chicago. Royalty, $25.00.
Price, 75 cents.

Daddy Long-Legs


A charming comedy in 4 acts, by Jean Webster. 6 males,
7 females, and 6 orphans, but by easy doubling of some characters,
may be played by 4 males, 4 females and 3 orphans.
The orphans appear only in the first act and may be played
by small girls. 4 easy interiors. Costumes modern. Plays 2        
hours.

The New York Times wrote the following:

"If you will take your pencil and write down, one below
the other, the words delightful, charming, sweet, beautiful and
entertaining, and then draw a line and add them up, the answer
will be 'Daddy Long-Legs'. To that result you might even add
brilliant, pathetic and humorous, but the answer even then
would be just what it was before       the play which Miss Jean
Webster has made from her book, 'Daddy Long-Legs'. To attempt
to describe the simplicity and beauty of 'Daddy Long-Legs'
would be like attempting to describe the first breath of
Spring after an exceedingly tiresome and hard Winter."

Enjoyed a two-years' run in New York and was then toured
for over three years. Royalty, $25.00. Price, 75 cents.


To the Ladies


A hilarious comedy in 3 acts, by George S. Kaufman and
Marc Connelly. 11 males, 3 females. 3 interiors. Costumes,
modern. Plays 2         hours.

The authors of "Dulcy" have divulged a secret known to
every woman       and to some men, though the men don't admit it.

The central figures are young Leonard Beebe and his wife
Elsie, a little girl from Mobile. Leonard is the average young
American clerk, the kind who read all the "Success" stories in
the magazines and believe them. Elsie has determined to make
him something more. She has her hands full       even has to
make an after dinner speech for him       but she does it and the
play shows how.

Helen Hayes played Elsie and Otto Kruger impersonated
Leonard in New York, where it ran a whole season. Here's a
clean and wholesome play, deliciously funny and altogether a
diverting evening's entertainment. Royalty, $25.00. Price, 75
cents.


Three Live Ghosts

Comedy in 3 acts by Frederick Isham and Max Marcin. 6
males, 4 females (2 policemen). 1 interior throughout. Costumes,
modern. Plays 2         hours.

"Three Live Ghosts" is brim full of fun and humor and is
sure to keep audiences in gales of laughter. The New York
critics described it as the most ingenious and amusing comedy
of the season, genuinely funny. It played a fall season in
New York, then toured the big cities. A lively comedy of merit.
Royalty, $25.00. Price, 75 cents.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
