THE ROOTS OF THE MOUNTAINS
WHEREIN IS TOLD SOMEWHAT OF
THE LIVES OF THE MEN OF BURG-
DALE THEIR FRIENDS THEIR
NEIGHBOURS THEIR FOEMEN AND
THEIR FELLOWS IN ARMS
BY WILLIAM MORRIS
Whiles carried o&rsquo;er the iron road,
We hurry by some fair abode;
The garden bright amidst the hay,
The yellow wain upon the way,
The dining men, the wind that sweeps
Light locks from off the sun-sweet heaps&mdash;
The gable grey, the hoary roof,
Here now&mdash;and now so far aloof.
How sorely then we long to stay
And midst its sweetness wear the day,
And &rsquo;neath its changing shadows sit,
And feel ourselves a part of it.
Such rest, such stay, I strove to win
With these same leaves that lie herein.

p. 1CHAPTER
I.&nbsp; OF BURGSTEAD AND ITS FOLK AND ITS NEIGHBOURS.
Once upon a time amidst the
mountains and hills and falling streams of a fair land there was
a town or thorp in a certain valley.&nbsp; This was well-nigh
encompassed by a wall of sheer cliffs; toward the East and the
great mountains they drew together till they went near to meet,
and left but a narrow path on either side of a stony stream that
came rattling down into the Dale: toward the river at that end
the hills lowered somewhat, though they still ended in sheer
rocks; but up from it, and more especially on the north side,
they swelled into great shoulders of land, then dipped a little,
and rose again into the sides of huge fells clad with pine-woods,
and cleft here and there by deep ghylls: thence again they rose
higher and steeper, and ever higher till they drew dark and naked
out of the woods to meet the snow-fields and ice-rivers of the
high mountains.&nbsp; But that was far away from the pass by the
little river into the valley; and the said river was no drain
from the snow-fields white and thick with the grinding of the
ice, but clear and bright were its waters that came from wells
amidst the bare rocky heaths.
The upper end of the valley, where it first began to open out
from the pass, was rugged and broken by rocks and ridges of
water-borne stones, but presently it smoothed itself into mere
grassy swellings and knolls, and at last into a fair and fertile
plain swelling up into a green wave, as it were, against the
rock-wall which encompassed it on all sides save where the river
came gushing out of the strait pass at the east end, and where at
the west end it poured itself out of the Dale toward the lowlands
and the plain of the great river.
Now the valley was some ten miles of our measure from that
place of the rocks and the stone-ridges, to where the faces of
the hills drew somewhat anigh to the river again at the west, and
p. 2then fell
aback along the edge of the great plain; like as when ye fare
a-sailing past two nesses of a river-mouth, and the main-sea
lieth open before you.
Besides the river afore-mentioned, which men called the
Weltering Water, there were other waters in the Dale.&nbsp; Near
the eastern pass, entangled in the rocky ground was a deep tarn
full of cold springs and about two acres in measure, and
therefrom ran a stream which fell into the Weltering Water amidst
the grassy knolls.&nbsp; Black seemed the waters of that tarn
which on one side washed the rocks-wall of the Dale; ugly and
aweful it seemed to men, and none knew what lay beneath its
waters save black mis-shapen trouts that few cared to bring to
net or angle: and it was called the Death-Tarn.
Other waters yet there were: here and there from the hills on
both sides, but especially from the south side, came trickles of
water that ran in pretty brooks down to the river; and some of
these sprang bubbling up amidst the foot-mounds of the
sheer-rocks; some had cleft a rugged and strait way through them,
and came tumbling down into the Dale at diverse heights from
their faces.&nbsp; But on the north side about halfway down the
Dale, one stream somewhat bigger than the others, and dealing
with softer ground, had cleft for itself a wider way; and the
folk had laboured this way wider yet, till they had made them a
road running north along the west side of the stream.&nbsp; Sooth
to say, except for the strait pass along the river at the eastern
end, and the wider pass at the western, they had no other way
(save one of which a word anon) out of the Dale but such as
mountain goats and bold cragsmen might take; and even of these
but few.
This midway stream was called the Wildlake, and the way along
it Wildlake&rsquo;s Way, because it came to them out of the wood,
which on that north side stretched away from nigh to the lip of
the valley-wall up to the pine woods and the high fells on the
east and north, and down to the plain country on the west and
south.
p. 3Now when
the Weltering Water came out of the rocky tangle near the pass,
it was turned aside by the ground till it swung right up to the
feet of the Southern crags; then it turned and slowly bent round
again northward, and at last fairly doubled back on itself before
it turned again to run westward; so that when, after its second
double, it had come to flowing softly westward under the northern
crags, it had cast two thirds of a girdle round about a space of
land a little below the grassy knolls and tofts aforesaid; and
there in that fair space between the folds of the Weltering Water
stood the Thorp whereof the tale hath told.
The men thereof had widened and deepened the Weltering Water
about them, and had bridged it over to the plain meads; and
athwart the throat of the space left clear by the water they had
built them a strong wall though not very high, with a gate amidst
and a tower on either side thereof.&nbsp; Moreover, on the face
of the cliff which was but a stone&rsquo;s throw from the gate
they had made them stairs and ladders to go up by; and on a knoll
nigh the brow had built a watch-tower of stone strong and great,
lest war should come into the land from over the hills.&nbsp;
That tower was ancient, and therefrom the Thorp had its name and
the whole valley also; and it was called Burgstead in
Burgdale.
So long as the Weltering Water ran straight along by the
northern cliffs after it had left Burgstead, betwixt the water
and the cliffs was a wide flat way fashioned by man&rsquo;s
hand.&nbsp; Thus was the water again a good defence to the Thorp,
for it ran slow and deep there, and there was no other ground
betwixt it and the cliffs save that road, which was easy to bar
across so that no foemen might pass without battle, and this road
was called the Portway.&nbsp; For a long mile the river ran under
the northern cliffs, and then turned into the midst of the Dale,
and went its way westward a broad stream winding in gentle laps
and folds here and there down to the out-gate of the Dale.&nbsp;
But the Portway held on still underneath the rock-wall, till the
sheer-rocks grew somewhat broken, and were cumbered with certain
screes, and at last p.
4the wayfarer came upon the break in them, and the ghyll
through which ran the Wildlake with Wildlake&rsquo;s Way beside
it, but the Portway still went on all down the Dale and away to
the Plain-country.
That road in the ghyll, which was neither wide nor smooth, the
wayfarer into the wood must follow, till it lifted itself out of
the ghyll, and left the Wildlake coming rattling down by many
steps from the east; and now the way went straight north through
the woodland, ever mounting higher, (because the whole set of the
land was toward the high fells,) but not in any cleft or
ghyll.&nbsp; The wood itself thereabout was thick, a blended
growth of diverse kinds of trees, but most of oak and ash; light
and air enough came through their boughs to suffer the holly and
bramble and eglantine and other small wood to grow together into
thickets, which no man could pass without hewing a way.&nbsp; But
before it is told whereto Wildlake&rsquo;s Way led, it must be
said that on the east side of the ghyll, where it first began
just over the Portway, the hill&rsquo;s brow was clear of wood
for a certain space, and there, overlooking all the Dale, was the
Mote-stead of the Dalesmen, marked out by a great ring of stones,
amidst of which was the mound for the Judges and the Altar of the
Gods before it.&nbsp; And this was the holy place of the men of
the Dale and of other folk whereof the tale shall now tell.
For when Wildlake&rsquo;s Way had gone some three miles from
the Mote-stead, the trees began to thin, and presently afterwards
was a clearing and the dwellings of men, built of timber as may
well be thought.&nbsp; These houses were neither rich nor great,
nor was the folk a mighty folk, because they were but a few,
albeit body by body they were stout carles enough.&nbsp; They had
not affinity with the Dalesmen, and did not wed with them, yet it
is to be deemed that they were somewhat akin to them.&nbsp; To be
short, though they were freemen, yet as regards the Dalesmen were
they well-nigh their servants; for they were but poor in goods,
and had to lean upon them somewhat.&nbsp; No tillage they  a
name="page5">p. 5had among those
high trees; and of beasts nought save some flocks of goats and a
few asses.&nbsp; Hunters they were, and charcoal-burners, and
therein the deftest of men, and they could shoot well in the bow
withal: so they trucked their charcoal and their smoked venison
and their peltries with the Dalesmen for wheat and wine and
weapons and weed; and the Dalesmen gave them main good
pennyworths, as men who had abundance wherewith to uphold their
kinsmen, though they were but far-away kin.&nbsp; Stout hands had
these Woodlanders and true hearts as any; but they were
few-spoken and to those that needed them not somewhat surly of
speech and grim of visage: brown-skinned they were, but
light-haired; well-eyed, with but little red in their cheeks:
their women were not very fair, for they toiled like the men, or
more.&nbsp; They were thought to be wiser than most men in
foreseeing things to come.&nbsp; They were much given to spells,
and songs of wizardry, and were very mindful of the old
story-lays, wherein they were far more wordy than in their daily
speech.&nbsp; Much skill had they in runes, and were exceeding
deft in scoring them on treen bowls, and on staves, and
door-posts and roof-beams and standing-beds and such like
things.&nbsp; Many a day when the snow was drifting over their
roofs, and hanging heavy on the tree-boughs, and the wind was
roaring through the trees aloft and rattling about the close
thicket, when the boughs were clattering in the wind, and
crashing down beneath the weight of the gathering freezing snow,
when all beasts and men lay close in their lairs, would they sit
long hours about the house-fire with the knife or the gouge in
hand, with the timber twixt their knees and the whetstone beside
them, hearkening to some tale of old times and the days when
their banner was abroad in the world; and they the while
wheedling into growth out of the tough wood knots and blossoms
and leaves and the images of beasts and warriors and women.
They were called nought save the Woodland-Carles in that day,
though time had been when they had borne a nobler name: and their
abode was called Carlstead.&nbsp; Shortly, for all they had  a
name="page6">p. 6and all they
had not, for all they were and all they were not, they were
well-beloved by their friends and feared by their foes.
Now when Wildlake&rsquo;s Way was gotten to Carlstead, there
was an end of it toward the north; though beyond it in a right
line the wood was thinner, because of the hewing of the
Carles.&nbsp; But the road itself turned west at once and went on
through the wood, till some four miles further it first thinned
and then ceased altogether, the ground going down-hill all the
way: for this was the lower flank of the first great upheaval
toward the high mountains.&nbsp; But presently, after the wood
was ended, the land broke into swelling downs and winding dales
of no great height or depth, with a few scattered trees about the
hillsides, mostly thorns or scrubby oaks, gnarled and bent and
kept down by the western wind: here and there also were
yew-trees, and whiles the hillsides would be grown over with
box-wood, but none very great; and often juniper grew
abundantly.&nbsp; This then was the country of the Shepherds, who
were friends both of the Dalesmen and the Woodlanders.&nbsp; They
dwelt not in any fenced town or thorp, but their homesteads were
scattered about as was handy for water and shelter.&nbsp;
Nevertheless they had their own stronghold; for amidmost of their
country, on the highest of a certain down above a bottom where a
willowy stream winded, was a great earthwork: the walls thereof
were high and clean and overlapping at the entering in, and
amidst of it was a deep well of water, so that it was a very
defensible place: and thereto would they drive their flocks and
herds when war was in the land, for nought but a very great host
might win it; and this stronghold they called Greenbury.
These Shepherd-Folk were strong and tall like the Woodlanders,
for they were partly of the same blood, but burnt they were both
ruddy and brown: they were of more words than the Woodlanders but
yet not many-worded.&nbsp; They knew well all those old
story-lays, (and this partly by the minstrelsy of the
Woodlanders,) but they had scant skill in wizardry, and would
send for the Woodlanders, both men and women, to do whatso they
needed therein.&nbsp; They  span
class="pagenum">p. 7were very hale and long-lived, whereas
they dwelt in clear bright air, and they mostly went light-clad
even in the winter, so strong and merry were they.&nbsp; They
wedded with the Woodlanders and the Dalesmen both; at least
certain houses of them did so.&nbsp; They grew no corn; nought
but a few pot-herbs, but had their meal of the Dalesmen; and in
the summer they drave some of their milch-kine into the Dale for
the abundance of grass there; whereas their own hills and bents
and winding valleys were not plenteously watered, except here and
there as in the bottom under Greenbury.&nbsp; No swine they had,
and but few horses, but of sheep very many, and of the best both
for their flesh and their wool.&nbsp; Yet were they nought so
deft craftsmen at the loom as were the Dalesmen, and their women
were not very eager at the weaving, though they loathed not the
spindle and rock.&nbsp; Shortly, they were merry folk
well-beloved of the Dalesmen, quick to wrath, though it abode not
long with them; not very curious in their houses and halls, which
were but little, and were decked mostly with the handiwork of the
Woodland-Carles their guests; who when they were abiding with
them, would oft stand long hours nose to beam, scoring and
nicking and hammering, answering no word spoken to them but with
aye or no, desiring nought save the endurance of the
daylight.&nbsp; Moreover, this shepherd-folk heeded not gay
raiment over-much, but commonly went clad in white woollen or
sheep-brown weed.
But beyond this shepherd-folk were more downs and more,
scantily peopled, and that after a while by folk with whom they
had no kinship or affinity, and who were at whiles their
foes.&nbsp; Yet was there no enduring enmity between them; and
ever after war and battle came peace; and all blood-wites were
duly paid and no long feud followed: nor were the Dalesmen and
the Woodlanders always in these wars, though at whiles they
were.&nbsp; Thus then it fared with these people.
But now that we have told of the folks with whom the Dalesmen
had kinship, affinity, and friendship, tell we of their chief  a
name="page8">p. 8abode,
Burgstead to wit, and of its fashion.&nbsp; As hath been told, it
lay upon the land made nigh into an isle by the folds of the
Weltering Water towards the uppermost end of the Dale; and it was
warded by the deep water, and by the wall aforesaid with its
towers.&nbsp; Now the Dale at its widest, to wit where Wildlake
fell into it, was but nine furlongs over, but at Burgstead it was
far narrower; so that betwixt the wall and the wandering stream
there was but a space of fifty acres, and therein lay Burgstead
in a space of the shape of a sword-pommel: and the houses of the
kinships lay about it, amidst of gardens and orchards, but little
ordered into streets and lanes, save that a way went clean
through everything from the tower-warded gate to the bridge over
the Water, which was warded by two other towers on its hither
side.
As to the houses, they were some bigger, some smaller, as the
housemates needed.&nbsp; Some were old, but not very old, save
two only, and some quite new, but of these there were not many:
they were all built fairly of stone and lime, with much fair and
curious carved work of knots and beasts and men round about the
doors; or whiles a wale of such-like work all along the
house-front.&nbsp; For as deft as were the Woodlanders with knife
and gouge on the oaken beams, even so deft were the Dalesmen with
mallet and chisel on the face of the hewn stone; and this was a
great pastime about the Thorp.&nbsp; Within these houses had but
a hall and solar, with shut-beds out from the hall on one side or
two, with whatso of kitchen and buttery and out-bower men deemed
handy.&nbsp; Many men dwelt in each house, either kinsfolk, or
such as were joined to the kindred.
Near to the gate of Burgstead in that street aforesaid and
facing east was the biggest house of the Thorp; it was one of the
two abovesaid which were older than any other.&nbsp; Its
door-posts and the lintel of the door were carved with knots and
twining stems fairer than other houses of that stead; and on the
wall beside the door carved over many stones was an image  a
name="page9">p. 9wrought in the
likeness of a man with a wide face, which was terrible to behold,
although it smiled: he bore a bent bow in his hand with an arrow
fitted to its string, and about the head of him was a ring of
rays like the beams of the sun, and at his feet was a dragon,
which had crept, as it were, from amidst of the blossomed knots
of the door-post wherewith the tail of him was yet
entwined.&nbsp; And this head with the ring of rays about it was
wrought into the adornment of that house, both within and
without, in many other places, but on never another house of the
Dale; and it was called the House of the Face.&nbsp; Thereof hath
the tale much to tell hereafter, but as now it goeth on to tell
of the ways of life of the Dalesmen.
In Burgstead was no Mote-hall or Town-house or Church, such as
we wot of in these days; and their market-place was wheresoever
any might choose to pitch a booth: but for the most part this was
done in the wide street betwixt the gate and the bridge.&nbsp; As
to a meeting-place, were there any small matters between man and
man, these would the Alderman or one of the Wardens deal with,
sitting in Court with the neighbours on the wide space just
outside the Gate: but if it were to do with greater matters, such
as great manslayings and blood-wites, or the making of war or
ending of it, or the choosing of the Alderman and the Wardens,
such matters must be put off to the Folk-mote, which could but be
held in the place aforesaid where was the Doom-ring and the Altar
of the Gods; and at that Folk-mote both the Shepherd-Folk and the
Woodland-Carles foregathered with the Dalesmen, and duly said
their say.&nbsp; There also they held their great casts and made
offerings to the Gods for the Fruitfulness of the Year, the
ingathering of the increase, and in Memory of their
Forefathers.&nbsp; Natheless at Yule-tide also they feasted from
house to house to be glad with the rest of Midwinter, and many a
cup drank at those feasts to the memory of the fathers, and the
days when the world was wider to them, and their banners fared
far afield.
p. 10But
besides these dwellings of men in the field between the wall and
the water, there were homesteads up and down the Dale whereso men
found it easy and pleasant to dwell: their halls were built of
much the same fashion as those within the Thorp; but many had a
high garth-wall cast about them, so that they might make a stout
defence in their own houses if war came into the Dale.
As to their work afield; in many places the Dale was fair with
growth of trees, and especially were there long groves of sweet
chestnut standing on the grass, of the fruit whereof the folk had
much gain.&nbsp; Also on the south side nigh to the western end
was a wood or two of yew-trees very great and old, whence they
gat them bow-staves, for the Dalesmen also shot well in the
bow.&nbsp; Much wheat and rye they raised in the Dale, and
especially at the nether end thereof.&nbsp; Apples and pears and
cherries and plums they had in plenty; of which trees, some grew
about the borders of the acres, some in the gardens of the Thorp
and the homesteads.&nbsp; On the slopes that had grown from the
breaking down here and there of the Northern cliffs, and which
faced the South and the Sun&rsquo;s burning, were rows of goodly
vines, whereof the folk made them enough and to spare of strong
wine both white and red.
As to their beasts; swine they had a many, but not many sheep,
since herein they trusted to their trucking with their friends
the Shepherds; they had horses, and yet but a few, for they were
stout in going afoot; and, had they a journey to make with women
big with babes, or with children or outworn elders, they would
yoke their oxen to their wains, and go fair and softly whither
they would.&nbsp; But the said oxen and all their neat were
exceeding big and fair, far other than the little beasts of the
Shepherd-Folk; they were either dun of colour, or white with
black horns (and those very great) and black tail-tufts and
ear-tips.&nbsp; Asses they had, and mules for the paths of the
mountains to the east; geese and hens enough, and dogs not a few,

dun of colour, shag-haired.
As to their wares; they were very deft weavers of wool and
flax, and made a shift to dye the thrums in fair colours; since
both woad and madder came to them good cheap by means of the
merchants of the plain country, and of greening weeds was
abundance at hand.&nbsp; Good smiths they were in all the metals:
they washed somewhat of gold out of the sands of the Weltering
Water, and copper and tin they fetched from the rocks of the
eastern mountains; but of silver they saw little, and iron they
must buy of the merchants of the plain, who came to them twice in
the year, to wit in the spring and the late autumn just before
the snows.&nbsp; Their wares they bought with wool spun and in
the fleece, and fine cloth, and skins of wine and young neat both
steers and heifers, and wrought copper bowls, and gold and copper
by weight, for they had no stamped money.&nbsp; And they guested
these merchants well, for they loved them, because of the tales
they told them of the Plain and its cities, and the manslayings
therein, and the fall of Kings and Dukes, and the uprising of
Captains.
Thus then lived this folk in much plenty and ease of life,
though not delicately nor desiring things out of measure.&nbsp;
They wrought with their hands and wearied themselves; and they
rested from their toil and feasted and were merry: to-morrow was
not a burden to them, nor yesterday a thing which they would fain
forget: life shamed them not, nor did death make them afraid.
As for the Dale wherein they dwelt, it was indeed most fair
and lovely, and they deemed it the Blessing of the Earth, and
they trod its flowery grass beside its rippled streams amidst its
green tree-boughs proudly and joyfully with goodly bodies and
merry hearts.

12CHAPTER II.&nbsp; OF FACE-OF-GOD AND HIS KINDRED.
Tells the tale, that on an evening
of late autumn when the weather was fair, calm, and sunny, there
came a man out of the wood hard by the Mote-stead aforesaid, who
sat him down at the roots of the Speech-mound, casting down
before him a roe-buck which he had just slain in the wood.&nbsp;
He was a young man of three and twenty summers; he was so clad
that he had on him a sheep-brown kirtle and leggings of like
stuff bound about with white leather thongs; he bore a
short-sword in his girdle and a little axe withal; the sword with
fair wrought gilded hilts and a dew-shoe of like fashion to its
sheath.&nbsp; He had his quiver at his back and bare in his hand
his bow unstrung.&nbsp; He was tall and strong, very fair of
fashion both of limbs and face, white-skinned, but for the
sun&rsquo;s tanning, and ruddy-cheeked: his beard was little and
fine, his hair yellow and curling, cut somewhat close, but for
its length so plenteous, and so thick, that none could fail to
note it.&nbsp; He had no hat nor hood upon his head, nought but a
fillet of golden beads.
As he sat down he glanced at the dale below him with a
well-pleased look, and then cast his eyes down to the grass at
his feet, as though to hold a little longer all unchanged the
image of the fair place he had just seen.&nbsp; The sun was low
in the heavens, and his slant beams fell yellow all up the dale,
gilding the chestnut groves grown dusk and grey with autumn, and
the black masses of the elm-boughs, and gleaming back here and
there from the pools of the Weltering Water.&nbsp; Down in the
midmost meadows the long-horned dun kine were moving slowly as
they fed along the edges of the stream, and a dog was bounding
about with exceeding swiftness here and there among them.&nbsp;
At a sharply curved bight of the river the man could see a little
vermilion flame flickering about, and above it a thin blue veil
of smoke hanging in the air, and clinging to the boughs of the
willows anear; about it were a dozen menfolk clear to see, some
sitting, some standing,  span
class="pagenum">p. 13some walking to and fro, but all in
company together: four of were brown-clad and short-skirted like
himself, and from above the hand of one came a flash of light as
the sun smote upon the steel of his spear.&nbsp; The others were
long-skirted and clad gayer, and amongst them were red and blue
and green and white garments, and they were clear to be seen for
women.&nbsp; Just as the young man looked up again, those of them
who were sitting down rose up, and those that were strolling drew
nigh, and they joined hands together, and fell to dancing on the
grass, and the dog and another one with him came up to the
dancers and raced about and betwixt them; and so clear to see
were they all and so little, being far away, that they looked
like dainty well-wrought puppets.
The young man sat smiling at it for a little, and then rose up
and shouldered his venison, and went down into Wildlake&rsquo;s
Way, and presently was fairly in the Dale and striding along the
Portway beside the northern cliffs, whose greyness was gilded yet
by the last rays of the sun, though in a minute or two it would
go under the western rim.&nbsp; He went fast and cheerily,
murmuring to himself snatches of old songs; none overtook him on
the road, but he overtook divers folk going alone or in company
toward Burgstead; swains and old men, mothers and maidens coming
from the field and the acre, or going from house to house; and
one or two he met but not many.&nbsp; All these greeted him
kindly, and he them again; but he stayed not to speak with any,
but went as one in haste.
It was dusk by then he passed under the gate of Burgstead; he
went straight thence to the door of the House of the Face, and
entered as one who is at home, and need go no further, nor abide
a bidding.
The hall he came into straight out of the open air was long
and somewhat narrow and not right high; it was well-nigh dark now
within, but since he knew where to look, he could see by the
flicker that leapt up now and then from the smouldering brands of
the hearth amidmost the hall under the luffer, that there were  a
name="page14">p. 14but three men
therein, and belike they were even they whom he looked to find
there, and for their part they looked for his coming, and knew
his step.
He set down his venison on the floor, and cried out in a
cheery voice: &lsquo;Ho, Kettel!&nbsp; Are all men gone without
doors to sleep so near the winter-tide, that the Hall is as dark
as a cave?&nbsp; Hither to me!&nbsp; Or art thou also
sleeping?&rsquo;
A voice came from the further side of the hearth: &lsquo;Yea,
lord, asleep I am, and have been, and dreaming; and in my dream I
dealt with the flesh-pots and the cake-board, and thou shalt see
my dream come true presently to thy gain.&rsquo;
Quoth another voice: &lsquo;Kettel hath had out that share of
his dream already belike, if the saw sayeth sooth about
cooks.&nbsp; All ye have been away, so belike he hath done as
Rafe&rsquo;s dog when Rafe ran away from the slain
buck.&rsquo;
He laughed therewith, and Kettel with him, and a third voice
joined the laughter.&nbsp; The young man also laughed and said:
&lsquo;Here I bring the venison which my kinsman desired; but as
ye see I have brought it over-late: but take it, Kettel.&nbsp;
When cometh my father from the stithy?&rsquo;
Quoth Kettel: &lsquo;My lord hath been hard at it shaping the
Yule-tide sword, and doth not lightly leave such work, as ye wot,
but he will be here presently, for he has sent to bid us dight
for supper straightway.&rsquo;
Said the young man: &lsquo;Where are there lords in the dale,
Kettel, or hast thou made some thyself, that thou must be always
throwing them in my teeth?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Son of the Alderman,&rsquo; said Kettel, &lsquo;ye call
me Kettel, which is no name of mine, so why should I not call
thee lord, which is no dignity of thine, since it goes well over
my tongue from old use and wont?&nbsp; But here comes my mate of
the kettle, and the women and lads.&nbsp; Sit down by the hearth
away from their hurry, and I will fetch thee the
hand-water.&rsquo;
The young man sat down, and Kettel took up the venison  a
name="page15">p. 15and went his
ways toward the door at the lower end of the hall; but ere he
reached it it opened, and a noisy crowd entered of men, women,
boys, and dogs, some bearing great wax candles, some bowls and
cups and dishes and trenchers, and some the boards for the
meal.
The young man sat quiet smiling and winking his eyes at the
sudden flood of light let into the dark place; he took in without
looking at this or the other thing the aspect of his
Fathers&rsquo; House, so long familiar to him; yet to-night he
had a pleasure in it above his wont, and in all the stir of the
household; for the thought of the wood wherein he had wandered
all day yet hung heavy upon him.&nbsp; Came one of the girls and
cast fresh brands on the smouldering fire and stirred it into a
blaze, and the wax candles were set up on the da&iuml;s, so that
between them and the mew-quickened fire every corner of the hall
was bright.&nbsp; As aforesaid it was long and narrow,
over-arched with stone and not right high, the windows high up
under the springing of the roof-arch and all on the side toward
the street; over against them were the arches of the shut-beds of
the housemates.&nbsp; The walls were bare that evening, but folk
were wont to hang up hallings of woven pictures thereon when
feasts and high-days were toward; and all along the walls were
the tenter-hooks for that purpose, and divers weapons and tools
were hanging from them here and there.&nbsp; About the da&iuml;s
behind the thwart-table were now stuck for adornment leavy boughs
of oak now just beginning to turn with the first frosts.&nbsp;
High up on the gable wall above the tenter-hooks for the hangings
were carven fair imagery and knots and twining stems; for there
in the hewn atone was set forth that same image with the rayed
head that was on the outside wall, and he was smiting the dragon
and slaying him; but here inside the house all this was stained
in fair and lively colours, and the sun-like rays round the head
of the image were of beaten gold.&nbsp; At the lower end of the
hall were two doors going into the butteries, and kitchen, and
other p.
16out-bowers; and above these doors was a loft upborne by
stone pillars, which loft was the sleeping chamber of the goodman
of the house; but the outward door was halfway between the said
loft and the hearth of the hall.
So the young man took the shoes from his feet and then sat
watching the women and lads arraying the boards, till Kettel came
again to him with an old woman bearing the ewer and basin, who
washed his feet and poured the water over his hands, and gave him
the towel with fair-broidered ends to dry them withal.
Scarce had he made an end of this ere through the outer door
came in three men and a young woman with them; the foremost of
these was a man younger by some two years than the first-comer,
but so like him that none might misdoubt that he was his brother;
the next was an old man with a long white beard, but hale and
upright; and lastly came a man of middle-age, who led the young
woman by the hand.&nbsp; He was taller than the first of the
young men, though the other who entered with him outwent him in
height; a stark carle he was, broad across the shoulders, thin in
the flank, long-armed and big-handed; very noble and
well-fashioned of countenance, with a straight nose and grey eyes
underneath a broad brow: his hair grown somewhat scanty was done
about with a fillet of golden beads like the young men his
sons.&nbsp; For indeed this was their father, and the master of
the House.
His name was Iron-face, for he was the deftest of
weapon-smiths, and he was the Alderman of the Dalesmen, and
well-beloved of them; his kindred was deemed the noblest of the
Dale, and long had they dwelt in the House of the Face.&nbsp; But
of his sons the youngest, the new-comer, was named Hall-face, and
his brother the elder Face-of-god; which name was of old use
amongst the kindred, and many great men and stout warriors had
borne it aforetime: and this young man, in great love had he been
gotten, and in much hope had he been reared, and therefore had he
been named after the best of the kindred.&nbsp; But  a
name="page17">p. 17his mother,
who was hight the Jewel, and had been a very fair woman, was dead
now, and Iron-face lacked a wife.
Face-of-god was well-beloved of his kindred and of all the
Folk of the Dale, and he had gotten a to-name, and was called
Gold-mane because of the abundance and fairness of his hair.
As for the young woman that was led in by Iron-face, she was
the betrothed of Face-of-god, and her name was the Bride.&nbsp;
She looked with such eyes of love on him when she saw him in the
hall, as though she had never seen him before but once, nor loved
him but since yesterday; though in truth they had grown up
together and had seen each other most days of the year for many
years.&nbsp; She was of the kindred with whom the chiefs and
great men of the Face mostly wedded, which was indeed far away
kindred of them.&nbsp; She was a fair woman and strong: not
easily daunted amidst perils she was hardy and handy and
light-foot: she could swim as well as any, and could shoot well
in the bow, and wield sword and spear: yet was she kind and
compassionate, and of great courtesy, and the very dogs and kine
trusted in her and loved her.&nbsp; Her hair was dark red of hue,
long and fine and plenteous, her eyes great and brown, her brow
broad and very fair, her lips fine and red: her cheek not ruddy,
yet nowise sallow, but clear and bright: tall she was and of
excellent fashion, but well-knit and well-measured rather than
slender and wavering as the willow-bough.&nbsp; Her voice was
sweet and soft, her words few, but exceeding dear to the
listener.&nbsp; In short, she was a woman born to be the ransom
of her Folk.
Now as to the names which the menfolk of the Face bore, and
they an ancient kindred, a kindred of chieftains, it has been
said that in times past their image of the God of the Earth had
over his treen face a mask of beaten gold fashioned to the shape
of the image; and that when the Alderman of the Folk died, he to
wit who served the God and bore on his arm the gold-ring between
the people and the altar, this visor or face of God was laid over
the face of him who had been in a manner his priest,  a
name="page18">p. 18and therewith
he was borne to mound; and the new Alderman and priest had it in
charge to fashion a new visor for the God; and whereas for long
this great kindred had been chieftains of the people, they had
been, and were all so named, that the word Face was ever a part
of their names.
CHAPTER III.&nbsp; THEY TALK OF DIVERS MATTERS IN THE
HALL.
Now Face-of-god, who is also called
Gold-mane, rose up to meet the new-comers, and each of them
greeted him kindly, and the Bride kissed him on the cheek, and he
her in likewise; and he looked kindly on her, and took her hand,
and went on up the hall to the da&iuml;s, following his father
and the old man; as for him, he was of the kindred of the House,
and was foster-father of Iron-face and of his sons both; and his
name was Stone-face: a stark warrior had he been when he was
young, and even now he could do a man&rsquo;s work in the
battlefield, and his understanding was as good as that of a man
in his prime.&nbsp; So went these and four others up on to the
da&iuml;s and sat down before the thwart-table looking down the
hall, for the meat was now on the board; and of the others there
were some fifty men and women who were deemed to be of the
kindred and sat at the endlong tables.
So then the Alderman stood up and made the sign of the Hammer
over the meat, the token of his craft and of his God.&nbsp; Then
they fell to with good hearts, for there was enough and to spare
of meat and drink.&nbsp; There was bread and flesh (though not
Gold-mane&rsquo;s venison), and leeks and roasted chestnuts of
the grove, and red-cheeked apples of the garth, and honey enough
of that year&rsquo;s gathering, and medlars sharp and mellow:
moreover, good wine of the western bents went up and down the
hall in great gilded copper bowls and in mazers girt and lipped
with gold.
p. 19But
when they were full of meat, and had drunken somewhat, they fell
to speech, and Iron-face spake aloud to his son, who had but been
speaking softly to the Bride as one playmate to the other: but
the Alderman said: &lsquo;Scarce are the wood-deer grown,
kinsman, when I must needs eat sheep&rsquo;s flesh on a Thursday,
though my son has lain abroad in the woods all night to hunt for
me.&rsquo;
And therewith he smiled in the young man&rsquo;s face; but
Gold-mane reddened and said: &lsquo;So is it, kinsman, I can hit
what I can see; but not what is hidden.&rsquo;
Iron-face laughed and said: &lsquo;Hast thou been to the
Woodland-Carles? are their women fairer than our
cousins?&rsquo;
Face-of-god took up the Bride&rsquo;s hand in his and kissed
it and laid it to his cheek; and then turned to his father and
said: &lsquo;Nay, father, I saw not the Wood-carles, nor went to
their abode; and on no day do I lust after their women.&nbsp;
Moreover, I brought home a roebuck of the fattest; but I was
over-late for Kettel, and the flesh was ready for the board by
then I came.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Well, son,&rsquo; quoth Iron-face, for he was merry,
&lsquo;a roebuck is but a little deer for such big men as are
thou and I.&nbsp; But I rede thee take the Bride along with thee
the next time; and she shall seek whilest thou sleepest, and hit
when thou missest.&rsquo;
Then Face-of-god smiled, but he frowned somewhat also, and he
said: &lsquo;Well were that, indeed!&nbsp; But if ye must needs
drag a true tale out of me: that roebuck I shot at the very edge
of the wood nigh to the Mote-stead as I was coming home: harts
had I seen in the wood and its lawns, and boars, and bucks, and
loosed not at them: for indeed when I awoke in the morning in
that wood-lawn ye wot of, I wandered up and down with my bow
unbent.&nbsp; So it was that I fared as if I were seeking
something, I know not what, that should fill up something lacking
to me, I know not what.&nbsp; Thus I felt in myself even so long
as I was underneath the black boughs, and there was none beside
me and before me, and none to turn aback to: but when I came out
again into the p.
20sunshine, and I saw the fair dale, and the happy abode
lying before me, and folk abroad in the meads merry in the
eventide; then was I full fain of it, and loathed the wood as an
empty thing that had nought to give me; and lo you! all that I
had been longing for in the wood, was it not in this House and
ready to my hand?&mdash;and that is good meseemeth.&rsquo;
Therewith he drank of the cup which the Bride put into his
hand after she had kissed the rim, but when he had set it down
again he spake once more:
&lsquo;And yet now I am sitting honoured and well-beloved in
the House of my Fathers, with the holy hearth sparkling and
gleaming down there before me; and she that shall bear my
children sitting soft and kind by my side, and the bold lads I
shall one day lead in battle drinking out of my very cup: now it
seems to me that amidst all this, the dark cold wood, wherein
abide but the beasts and the Foes of the Gods, is bidding me to
it and drawing me thither.&nbsp; Narrow is the Dale and the World
is wide; I would it were dawn and daylight, that I might be afoot
again.&rsquo;
And he half rose up from his place.&nbsp; But his father bent
his brow on him and said: &lsquo;Kinsman, thou hast a long tongue
for a half-trained whelp: nor see I whitherward thy mind is
wandering, but if it be on the road of a lad&rsquo;s desire to go
further and fare worse.&nbsp; Hearken then, I will offer thee
somewhat!&nbsp; Soon shall the West-country merchants be here
with their winter truck.&nbsp; How sayest thou? hast thou a mind
to fare back with them, and look on the Plain and its Cities, and
take and give with the strangers?&nbsp; To whom indeed thou shalt
be nothing save a purse with a few lumps of gold in it, or maybe
a spear in the stranger&rsquo;s band on the stricken field, or a
bow on the wall of an alien city.&nbsp; This is a craft which
thou mayst well learn, since thou shalt be a chieftain; a craft
good to learn, however grievous it be in the learning.&nbsp; And
I myself have been there; for in my youth I desired sore to look
on the world beyond the mountains; so I went, and I filled my
belly with the fruit of my own desires, and a bitter  a
name="page21">p. 21meat was
that; but now that it has passed through me, and I yet alive,
belike I am more of a grown man for having endured its
gripe.&nbsp; Even so may it well be with thee, son; so go if thou
wilt; and thou shalt go with my blessing, and with gold and wares
and wain and spearmen.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;I thank thee, for
it is well offered; but I will not go, for I have no lust for the
Plain and its Cities; I love the Dale well, and all that is round
about it; therein will I live and die.&rsquo;
Therewith he fell a-musing; and the Bride looked at him
anxiously, but spake not.&nbsp; Sooth to say her heart was
sinking, as though she foreboded some new thing, which should
thrust itself into their merry life.
But the old man Stone-face took up the word and said:
&lsquo;Son Gold-mane, it behoveth me to speak, since belike I
know the wild-wood better than most, and have done for these
three-score and ten years; to my cost.&nbsp; Now I perceive that
thou longest for the wood and the innermost of it; and wot ye
what?&nbsp; This longing will at whiles entangle the sons of our
chieftains, though this Alderman that now is hath been free
therefrom, which is well for him.&nbsp; For, time was this
longing came over me, and I went whither it led me: overlong it
were to tell of all that befell me because of it, and how my
heart bled thereby.&nbsp; So sorry were the tidings that came of
it, that now meseemeth my heart should be of stone and not my
face, had it not been for the love wherewith I have loved the
sons of the kindred.&nbsp; Therefore, son, it were not ill if ye
went west away with the merchants this winter, and learned the
dealings of the cities, and brought us back tales
thereof.&rsquo;
But Gold-mane cried out somewhat angrily, &lsquo;I tell thee,
foster-father, that I have no mind for the cities and their men
and their fools and their whores and their runagates.&nbsp; But
as for the wood and its wonders, I have done with it, save for
hunting there along with others of the Folk.&nbsp; So let thy
mind be at ease; and for  span
class="pagenum">p. 22the rest, I will do what the Alderman
commandeth, and whatso my father craveth of me.&rsquo;
&lsquo;And that is well, son,&rsquo; said Stone-face,
&lsquo;if what ye say come to pass, as sore I misdoubt me it will
not.&nbsp; But well it were, well it were!&nbsp; For such things
are in the wood, yea and before ye come to its innermost, as may
well try the stoutest heart.&nbsp; Therein are Kobbolds, and
Wights that love not men, things unto whom the grief of men is as
the sound of the fiddle-bow unto us.&nbsp; And there abide the
ghosts of those that may not rest; and there wander the dwarfs
and the mountain-dwellers, the dealers in marvels, the givers of
gifts that destroy Houses; the forgers of the curse that clingeth
and the murder that flitteth to and fro.&nbsp; There moreover are
the lairs of Wights in the shapes of women, that draw a young
man&rsquo;s heart out of his body, and fill up the empty place
with desire never to be satisfied, that they may mock him
therewith and waste his manhood and destroy him.&nbsp; Nor say I
much of the strong-thieves that dwell there, since thou art a
valiant sword; or of them who have been made Wolves of the Holy
Places; or of the Murder-Carles, the remnants and off-scourings
of wicked and wretched Folks&mdash;men who think as much of the
life of a man as of the life of a fly.&nbsp; Yet happiest is the
man whom they shall tear in pieces, than he who shall live
burdened by the curse of the Foes of the Gods.&rsquo;
The housemaster looked on his son as the old carle spake, and
a cloud gathered on his face a while; and when Stone-face had
made an end he spake:
&lsquo;This is long and evil talk for the end of a merry day,
O fosterer!&nbsp; Wilt thou not drink a draught, O Redesman, and
then stand up and set thy fiddle-bow a-dancing, and cause it draw
some fair words after it?&nbsp; For my cousin&rsquo;s face hath
grown sadder than a young maid&rsquo;s should be, and my
son&rsquo;s eyes gleam with thoughts that are far away from us
and abroad in the wild-wood seeking marvels.&rsquo;
Then arose a man of middle-age from the top of the endlong  a
name="page23">p. 23bench on the
east side of the hall: a man tall, thin and scant-haired, with a
nose like an eagle&rsquo;s neb: he reached out his hand for the
bowl, and when they had given to him he handled it, and raised it
aloft and cried:
&lsquo;Here I drink a double health to Face-of-god and the
Bride, and the love that lieth between them, and the love betwixt
them twain and us.&rsquo;
He drank therewith, and the wine went up and down the hall,
and all men drank, both carles and queens, with shouting and
great joy.&nbsp; Then Redesman put down the cup (for it had come
into his hands again), and reached his hand to the wall behind
him, and took down his fiddle hanging there in its case, and drew
it out and fell to tuning it, while the hall grew silent to
hearken: then he handled the bow and laid it on the strings till
they wailed and chuckled sweetly, and when the song was well
awake and stirring briskly, then he lifted up his voice and
sang:
The Minstrel saith:
&lsquo;O why on this morning, ye maids, are ye
tripping
&nbsp;&nbsp; Aloof from the meadows yet fresh with the dew,
Where under the west wind the river is lipping
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fragrance of mint, the white blooms and the
blue?
For rough is the Portway where panting ye
wander;
&nbsp;&nbsp; On your feet and your gown-hems the dust lieth
dun;
Come trip through the grass and the meadow-sweet yonder,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And forget neath the willows the sword of the
sun.
The Maidens answer:
Though fair are the moon-daisies down by the
river,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And soft is the grass and the white clover sweet; br
/>
Though twixt us and the rock-wall the hot glare doth quiver, br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the dust of the wheel-way is dun on our
feet;
Yet here on the way shall we walk on this
morning
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though the sun burneth here, and sweet, cool is the
mead;
p. 24For here
when in old days the Burg gave its warning,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stood stark under weapons the doughty of deed.
Here came on the aliens their proud words
a-crying,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And here on our threshold they stumbled and fell; br
/>
Here silent at even the steel-clad were lying,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And here were our mothers the story to tell.
Here then on the morn of the eve of the
wedding
&nbsp;&nbsp; We pray to the Mighty that we too may bear
Such war-walls for warding of orchard and steading,
&nbsp;&nbsp; That the new days be merry as old days were
dear.&rsquo;
Therewith he made an end, and shouts and glad cries arose all
about the hall; and an old man arose and cried: &lsquo;A cup to
the memory of the Mighty of the Day of the Warding of the
Ways.&rsquo;&nbsp; For you must know this song told of a custom
of the Folk, held in memory of a time of bygone battle, wherein
they had overthrown a great host of aliens on the Portway betwixt
the river and the cliffs, two furlongs from the gate of
Burgstead.&nbsp; So now two weeks before Midsummer those maidens
who were presently to be wedded went early in the morning to that
place clad in very fair raiment, swords girt to their sides and
spears in their hands, and abode there on the highway from morn
till even as though they were a guard to it.&nbsp; And they made
merry there, singing songs and telling tales of times past: and
at the sunsetting their grooms came to fetch them away to the
Feast of the Eve of the Wedding.
While the song was a-singing Face-of-god took the
Bride&rsquo;s hand in his and caressed it, and was soft and
blithe with her; and she reddened and trembled for pleasure, and
called to mind wedding feasts that had been, and fair brides that
she had seen thereat, and she forgot her fears and her heart was
at peace again.
And Iron-face looked well-pleased on the two from time to
time, and smiled, but forbore words to them.
But up and down the hall men talked with one another about  a
name="page25">p. 25things long
ago betid: for their hearts were high and they desired deeds; but
in that fair Dale so happy were the years from day to day that
there was but little to tell of.&nbsp; So deepened the night and
waned, and Gold-mane and the Bride still talked sweetly together,
and at whiles kindly to the others; and by seeming he had clean
forgotten the wood and its wonders.
Then at last the Alderman called for the cup of good-night,
and men drank thereof and went their ways to bed.
CHAPTER IV.&nbsp; FACE-OF-GOD FARETH TO THE WOOD AGAIN.
When it was the earliest morning
and dawn was but just beginning, Face-of-god awoke and rose up
from his bed, and came forth into the hall naked in his shirt,
and stood by the hearth, wherein the piled-up embers were yet
red, and looked about and could see nothing stirring in the
dimness: then he fetched water and washed the night-tide off him,
and clad himself in haste, and was even as he was yesterday, save
that he left his bow and quiver in their place and took instead a
short casting-spear; moreover he took a leathern scrip and went
therewith to the buttery, and set therein bread and flesh and a
little gilded beaker; and all this he did with but little noise;
for he would not be questioned, lest he should have to answer
himself as well as others.
Thus he went quietly out of doors, for the door was but
latched, since no bolts or bars or locks were used in Burgstead,
and through the town-gate, which stood open, save when rumours of
war were about.&nbsp; He turned his face straight towards
Wildlake&rsquo;s Way, walking briskly, but at whiles looking back
over his shoulder toward the East to note what way was made by
the dawning, and how the sky lightened above the mountain
passes.
p. 26By then
he was come to the place where the Maiden Ward was held in the
summer the dawn was so far forward that all things had their due
colours, and were clear to see in the shadowless day.&nbsp; It
was a bright morning, with an easterly air stirring that drave
away the haze and dried the meadows, which had otherwise been
rimy; for it was cold.&nbsp; Gold-mane lingered on the place a
little, and his eyes fell on the road, as dusty yet as in
Redesman&rsquo;s song; for the autumn had been very dry, and the
strip of green that edged the outside of the way was worn and
dusty also.&nbsp; On the edge of it, half in the dusty road, half
on the worn grass, was a long twine of briony red-berried and
black-leaved; and right in the midst of the road were two twigs
of great-leaved sturdy pollard oak, as though they had been
thrown aside there yesterday by women or children a-sporting; and
the deep white dust yet held the marks of feet, some bare, some
shod, crossing each other here and there.&nbsp; Face-of-god
smiled as he passed on, as a man with a happy thought; for his
mind showed him a picture of the Bride as she would be leading
the Maiden Ward next summer, and singing first among the singers,
and he saw her as clearly as he had often seen her verily, and
before him was the fashion of her hands and all her body, and the
little mark on her right wrist, and the place where her arm
whitened, because the sleeve guarded it against the sun, which
had long been pleasant unto him, and the little hollow in her
chin, and the lock of red-brown hair waving in the wind above her
brow, and shining in the sun as brightly as the Alderman&rsquo;s
cunningest work of golden wire.&nbsp; Soft and sweet seemed that
picture, till he almost seemed to hear her sweet voice calling to
him, and desire of her so took hold of the youth, that it stirred
him up to go swiftlier as he strode on, the day brightening
behind him.
Now was it nigh sunrise, and he began to meet folk on the way,
though not many; since for most their way lay afield, and not
towards the Burg.&nbsp; The first was a Woodlander, tall and
gaunt, striding beside his ass, whose panniers were laden with  a
name="page27">p.
27charcoal.&nbsp; The carle&rsquo;s daughter, a little
maiden of seven winters, riding on the ass&rsquo;s back betwixt
the panniers, and prattling to herself in the cold morning; for
she was pleased with the clear light in the east, and the smooth
wide turf of the meadows, as one who had not often been far from
the shadow of the heavy trees of the wood, and their dark wall
round about the clearing where they dwelt.&nbsp; Face-of-god gave
the twain the sele of the day in merry fashion as he passed them
by, and the sober dark-faced man nodded to him but spake no word,
and the child stayed her prattle to watch him as he went by.
Then came the sound of the rattle of wheels, and, as he
doubled an angle of the rock-wall, he came upon a wain drawn by
four dun kine, wherein lay a young woman all muffled up against
the cold with furs and cloths; beside the yoke-beasts went her
man, a well-knit trim-faced Dalesman clad bravely in holiday
raiment, girt with a goodly sword, bearing a bright steel helm on
his head, in his hand a long spear with a gay red and white shaft
done about with copper bands.&nbsp; He looked merry and proud of
his wain-load, and the woman was smiling kindly on him from out
of her scarlet and fur; but now she turned a weary happy face on
Gold-mane, for they knew him, as did all men of the Dale.
So he stopped when they met, for the goodman had already
stayed his slow beasts, and the goodwife had risen a little on
her cushions to greet him, yet slowly and but a little, for she
was great with child, and not far from her time.&nbsp; That knew
Gold-mane well, and what was toward, and why the goodman wore his
fine clothes, and why the wain was decked with oak-boughs and the
yoke-beasts with their best gilded bells and copper-adorned
harness.&nbsp; For it was a custom with many of the kindreds that
the goodwife should fare to her father&rsquo;s house to lie in
with her first babe, and the day of her coming home was made a
great feast in the house.&nbsp; So then Face-of-god cried out:
&lsquo;Hail to thee, O Warcliff!&nbsp; Shrewd is the wind this
morning, and thou dost well to heed it carefully, this thine
orchard, this thy garden, this thy  span
class="pagenum">p. 28fair apple-tree!&nbsp; To a good hall
thou wendest, and the Wine of Increase shall be sweet there this
even.&rsquo;
Then smiled Warcliff all across his face, and the goodwife
hung her head and reddened.&nbsp; Said the goodman: &lsquo;Wilt
thou not be with us, son of the Alderman, as surely thy father
shall be?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;though I were fain
of it: my own matters carry me away.&rsquo;
&lsquo;What matters?&rsquo; said Warcliff; &lsquo;perchance
thou art for the cities this autumn?&rsquo;
Face-of-god answered somewhat stiffly: &lsquo;Nay, I am
not;&rsquo; and then more kindly, and smiling, &lsquo;All roads
lead not down to the Plain, friend.&rsquo;
&lsquo;What road then farest thou away from us?&rsquo; said
the goodwife.
&lsquo;The way of my will,&rsquo; he answered.
&lsquo;And what way is that?&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;take
heed, lest I get a longing to know.&nbsp; For then must thou
needs tell me, or deal with the carle there beside
thee.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay, goodwife,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;let not
that longing take thee; for on that matter I am even as wise as
thou.&nbsp; Now good speed to thee and to the
new-comer!&rsquo;
Therewith he went close up to the wain, and reached out his
hand to her, and she gave him hers and he kissed it, and so went
his ways smiling kindly on them.&nbsp; Then the carle cried to
his kine, and they bent down their heads to the yoke; and
presently, as he walked on, he heard the rumble of the wain
mingling with the tinkling of their bells, which in a little
while became measured and musical, and sounded above the creaking
of the axles and the rattle of the gear and the roll of the great
wheels over the road: and so it grew thinner and thinner till it
all died away behind him.
He was now come to where the river turned away from the sheer
rock-wall, which was not so high there as in most other places,
as there had been in old time long screes from the cliff, which
had now grown together, with the waxing of herbs and the  a
name="page29">p. 29washing down
of the earth on to them, and made a steady slope or low hill
going down riverward.&nbsp; Over this the road lifted itself
above the level of the meadows, keeping a little way from the
cliffs, while on the other side its bank was somewhat broken and
steep here and there.&nbsp; As Face-of-god came up to one of
these broken places, the sun rose over the eastern pass, and the
meadows grew golden with its long beams.&nbsp; He lingered, and
looked back under his hand, and as he did so heard the voices and
laughter of women coming up from the slope below him, and
presently a young woman came struggling up the broken bank with
hand and knee, and cast herself down on the roadside turf
laughing and panting.&nbsp; She was a long-limbed light-made
woman, dark-faced and black-haired: amidst her laughter she
looked up and saw Gold-mane, who had stopped at once when he saw
her; she held out her hands to him, and said lightly, though her
face flushed withal:
&lsquo;Come hither, thou, and help the others to climb the
bank; for they are beaten in the race, and now must they do after
my will; that was the forfeit.&rsquo;
He went up to her, and took her hands and kissed them, as was
the custom of the Dale, and said:
&lsquo;Hail to thee, Long-coat! who be they, and whither away
this morning early?&rsquo;
She looked hard at him, and fondly belike, as she answered
slowly: &lsquo;They be the two maidens of my father&rsquo;s
house, whom thou knowest; and our errand, all three of us, is to
Burgstead, the Feast of the Wine of Increase which shall be drunk
this even.&rsquo;
As she spake came another woman half up the bank, to whom went
Face-of-god, and, taking her hands, drew her up while she laughed
merrily in his face: he saluted her as he had Long-coat, and then
with a laugh turned about to wait for the third; who came indeed,
but after a little while, for she had abided, hearing their
voices.&nbsp; Her also Gold-mane drew up, and kissed  a
name="page30">p. 30her hands,
and she lay on the grass by Long-coat, but the second maiden
stood up beside the young man.&nbsp; She was white-skinned and
golden-haired, a very fair damsel, whereas the last-comer was but
comely, as were well-nigh all the women of the Dale.
Said Face-of-god, looking on the three: &lsquo;How comes it,
maidens, that ye are but in your kirtles this sharp autumn
morning? or where have ye left your gowns or your
cloaks?&rsquo;
For indeed they were clad but in close-fitting blue kirtles of
fine wool, embroidered about the hems with gold and coloured
threads.
The last-comer laughed and said: &lsquo;What ails thee,
Gold-mane, to be so careful of us, as if thou wert our mother or
our nurse?&nbsp; Yet if thou must needs know, there hang our
gowns on the thorn-bush down yonder; for we have been running a
match and a forfeit; to wit, that she who was last on the highway
should go down again and bring them up all three; and now that is
my day&rsquo;s work: but since thou art here, Alderman&rsquo;s
son, thou shalt go down instead of me and fetch them
up.&rsquo;
But he laughed merrily and outright, and said: &lsquo;That
will I not, for there be but twenty-four hours in the day, and
what between eating and drinking and talking to fair maidens, I
have enough to do in every one of them.&nbsp; Wasteful are ye
women, and simple is your forfeit.&nbsp; Now will I, who am the
Alderman&rsquo;s son, give forth a doom, and will ordain that one
of you fetch up the gowns yourselves, and that Long-coat be the
one; for she is the fleetest-footed and ablest thereto.&nbsp;
Will ye take my doom? for later on I shall not be
wiser.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said the fair woman, &lsquo;not because
thou art the Alderman&rsquo;s son, but because thou art the
fairest man of the Dale, and mayst bid us poor souls what thou
wilt.&rsquo;
Face-of-god reddened at her words, and the speaker and the
last-comer laughed; but Long-coat held her peace: she cast one
very sober look on him, and then ran lightly down the bent; he
drew near the edge of it, and watched her going; for her
light-foot p.
31slimness was fair to look on: and he noted that when she
was nigh the thorn-bush whereon hung the bright-broidered gowns,
and deemed belike that she was not seen, she kissed both her
hands where he had kissed them erst.
Thereat he drew aback and turned away shyly, scarce looking at
the other twain, who smiled on him with somewhat jeering looks;
but he bade them farewell and departed speedily; and if they
spoke, it was but softly, for he heard their voices no more.
He went on under the sunlight which was now gilding the
outstanding stones of the cliffs, and still his mind was set upon
the Bride; and his meeting with the mother of the yet unborn
baby, and with the three women with their freshness and fairness,
did somehow turn his thought the more upon her, since she was the
woman who was to be his amongst all women, for she was far fairer
than any one of them; and through all manner of life and through
all kinds of deeds would he be with her, and know more of her
fairness and kindness than any other could: and him-seemed he
could see pictures of her and of him amidst all these deeds and
ways.
Now he went very swiftly; for he was eager, though he knew not
for what, and he thought but little of the things on which his
eyes fell.&nbsp; He met none else on the road till he was come to
Wildlake&rsquo;s Way, though he saw folk enough down in the
meadows; he was soon amidst the first of the trees, and without
making any stay set his face east and somewhat north, that is,
toward the slopes that led to the great mountains.&nbsp; He said
to himself aloud, as he wended the wood: &lsquo;Strange!
yestereven I thought much of the wood, and I set my mind on not
going thither, and this morning I thought nothing of it, and here
am I amidst its trees, and wending towards its
innermost.&rsquo;
His way was easy at first, because the wood for a little space
was all of beech, so that there was no undergrowth, and he went
lightly betwixt the tall grey and smooth boles; albeit his heart
was nought so gay as it was in the dale amidst the
sunshine.&nbsp; After a while the beech-wood grew thinner, and at
last gave out p.
32altogether, and he came into a space of rough broken
ground with nought but a few scrubby oaks and thorn-bushes
growing thereon here and there.&nbsp; The sun was high in the
heavens now, and shone brightly down on the waste, though there
were a few white clouds high up above him.&nbsp; The rabbits
scuttled out of the grass before him; here and there he turned
aside from a stone on which lay coiled an adder sunning itself;
now and again both hart and hind bounded away from before him, or
a sounder of wild swine ran grunting away toward closer
covert.&nbsp; But nought did he see but the common sights and
sounds of the woodland; nor did he look for aught else, for he
knew this part of the woodland indifferent well.
He held on over this treeless waste for an hour or more, when
the ground began to be less rugged, and he came upon trees again,
but thinly scattered, oak and ash and hornbeam not right great,
with thickets of holly and blackthorn between them.&nbsp; The set
of the ground was still steadily up to the east and north-east,
and he followed it as one who wendeth an assured way.&nbsp; At
last before him seemed to rise a wall of trees and thicket; but
when he drew near to it, lo! an opening in a certain place, and a
little path as if men were wont to thread the tangle of the wood
thereby; though hitherto he had noted no slot of men, nor any
sign of them, since he had plunged into the deep of the
beech-wood.&nbsp; He took the path as one who needs must, and
went his ways as it led.&nbsp; In sooth it was well-nigh blind,
but he was a deft woodsman, and by means of it skirted many a
close thicket that had otherwise stayed him.&nbsp; So on he went,
and though the boughs were close enough overhead, and the sun
came through but in flecks, he judged that it was growing towards
noon, and he wotted well that he was growing aweary.&nbsp; For he
had been long afoot, and the more part of the time on a rough
way, or breasting a slope which was at whiles steep enough.
At last the track led him skirting about an exceeding close
thicket into a small clearing, through which ran a little
woodland p.
33rill amidst rushes and dead leaves: there was a low
mound near the eastern side of this wood-lawn, as though there
had been once a dwelling of man there, but no other sign or slot
of man was there.
So Face-of-god made stay in that place, casting himself down
beside the rill to rest him and eat and drink somewhat.&nbsp;
Whatever thoughts had been with him through the wood (and they
been many) concerning his House and his name, and his father, and
the journey he might make to the cities of the Westland, and what
was to befall him when he was wedded, and what war or trouble
should be on his hands&mdash;all this was now mingled together
and confused by this rest amidst his weariness.&nbsp; He laid
down his scrip, and drew his meat from it and ate what he would,
and dipping his gilded beaker into the brook, drank water
smacking of the damp musty savour of the woodland; and then his
head sank back on a little mound in the short turf, and he fell
asleep at once.&nbsp; A long dream he had in short space; and
therein were blent his thoughts of the morning with the deeds of
yesterday; and other matters long forgotten in his waking hours
came back to his slumber in unordered confusion: all which made
up for him pictures clear, but of little meaning, save that, as
oft befalls in dreams, whatever he was a-doing he felt himself
belated.
When he awoke, smiling at something strange in his gone-by
dream, he looked up to the heavens, thinking to see signs of the
even at hand, for he seemed to have been dreaming so long.&nbsp;
The sky was thinly overcast by now, but by his wonted woodcraft
he knew the whereabouts of the sun, and that it was scant an hour
after noon.&nbsp; He sat there till he was wholly awake, and then
drank once more of the woodland water; and he said to himself,
but out loud, for he was fain of the sound of a man&rsquo;s
voice, though it were but his own:
&lsquo;What is mine errand hither?&nbsp; Whither wend I?&nbsp;
What shall I have done to-morrow that I have hitherto left
undone?&nbsp; p.
34Or what manner of man shall I be then other than I am
now?&rsquo;
Yet though he said the words he failed to think the thought,
or it left him in a moment of time, and he thought but of the
Bride and her kindness.&nbsp; Yet that abode with him but a
moment, and again he saw himself and those two women on the
highway edge, and Long-coat lingering on the slope below, kissing
his kisses on her hands; and he was sorry that she desired him
over-much, for she was a fair woman and a friendly.&nbsp; But all
that also flowed from him at once, and he had no thought in him
but that he also desired something that he lacked: and this was a
burden to him, and he rose up frowning, and said to himself,
&lsquo;Am I become a mere sport of dreams, whether I sleep or
wake?&nbsp; I will go backward&mdash;or forward, but will think
no more.&rsquo;
Then he ordered his gear again, and took the path onward and
upward toward the Great Mountains; and the track was even fainter
than before for a while, so that he had to seek his way
diligently.
CHAPTER V.&nbsp; FACE-OF-GOD FALLS IN WITH MENFOLK ON THE
MOUNTAIN.
Now he plodded on steadily, and for
a long time the forest changed but little, and of wild things he
saw only a few of those that love the closest covert.&nbsp; The
ground still went up and up, though at whiles were hollows, and
steeper bents out of them again, and the half-blind path or slot
still led past the close thickets and fallen trees, and he made
way without let or hindrance.&nbsp; At last once more the wood
began to thin, and the trees themselves to be smaller and gnarled
and ill-grown: therewithal the day was waning, and the sky was
quite clear again as the afternoon grew into a fair autumn
evening.
Now the trees failed altogether, and the slope grown steeper
p. 35was
covered with heather and ling; and looking up, he saw before him
quite near by seeming in the clear even (though indeed they were
yet far away) the snowy peaks flushed with the sinking sun
against the frosty dark-grey eastern sky; and below them the dark
rock-mountains, and below these again, and nigh to him indeed,
the fells covered with pine-woods and looking like a wall to the
heaths he trod.
He stayed a little while and turned his head to look at the
way whereby he had come; but that way a swell of the oak-forest
hid everything but the wood itself, making a wall behind him as
the pine-wood made a wall before.&nbsp; There came across him
then a sharp memory of the boding words which Stone-face had
spoken last night, and he felt as if he were now indeed within
the trap.&nbsp; But presently he laughed and said: &lsquo;I am a
fool: this comes of being alone in the dark wood and the dismal
waste, after the merry faces of the Dale had swept away my
foolish musings of yesterday and the day before.&nbsp; Lo! here I
stand, a man of the Face, sword and axe by my side; if death
come, it can but come once; and if I fear not death, what shall
make me afraid?&nbsp; The Gods hate me not, and will not hurt me;
and they are not ugly, but beauteous.&rsquo;
Therewith he strode on again, and soon came to a place where
the ground sank into a shallow valley and the ling gave place to
grass for a while, and there were tall old pines scattered about,
and betwixt them grey rocks; this he passed through, climbing a
steep bent out of it, and the pines were all about him now,
though growing wide apart, till at last he came to where they
thickened into a wood, not very close, wherethrough he went
merrily, singing to himself and swinging his spear.&nbsp; He was
soon through this wood, and came on to a wide well-grassed
wood-lawn, hedged by the wood aforesaid on three sides, but
sloping up slowly toward the black wall of the thicker pine-wood
on the fourth side, and about half a furlong overthwart and
endlong.&nbsp; The sun had set while he was in the last wood, but
it was p.
36still broad daylight on the wood-lawn, and as he stood
there he was ware of a house under the pine-wood on the other
side, built long and low, much like the houses of the
Woodland-Carles, but rougher fashioned and of unhewn trees.&nbsp;
He gazed on it, and said aloud to himself as his wont was:
&lsquo;Marvellous! here is a dwelling of man, scarce a
day&rsquo;s journey from Burgstead; yet have I never heard tell
of it: may happen some of the Woodland-Carles have built it, and
are on some errand of hunting peltries up in the mountains, or
maybe are seeking copper and tin among the rocks.&nbsp; Well, at
least let us go see what manner of men dwell there, and if they
are minded for a guest to-night; for fain were I of a bed beneath
a roof, and of a board with strong meat and drink on
it.&rsquo;
Therewith he set forward, not heeding much that the wood he
had passed through was hard on his left hand; but he had gone but
twenty paces when he saw a red thing at the edge of the wood, and
then a glitter, and a spear came whistling forth, and smote his
own spear so hard close to the steel that it flew out of his
hand; then came a great shout, and a man clad in a scarlet kirtle
ran forth on him.&nbsp; Face-of-god had his axe in his hand in a
twinkling, and ran at once to meet his foe; but the man had the
hill on his side as he rushed on with a short-sword in his
hand.&nbsp; Axe and sword clashed together for a moment of time,
and then both the men rolled over on the grass together, and
Face-of-god as he fell deemed that he heard the shrill cry of a
woman.&nbsp; Now Face-of-god found that he was the nethermost,
for if he was strong, yet was his foe stronger; the axe had flown
out of his hand also, while the strange man still kept a hold of
his short-sword; and presently, though he still struggled all he
could, he saw the man draw back his hand to smite with the said
sword; and at that nick of time the foeman&rsquo;s knee was on
his breast, his left hand was doubled back behind him, and his
right wrist was gripped hard in the stranger&rsquo;s left
hand.&nbsp; Even therewith his ears, sharpened by the coming
death, heard the sound of footsteps and fluttering raiment
drawing near; p.
37something dark came between him and the sky; there was
the sound of a great stroke, and the big man loosened his grip
and fell off him to one side.
Face-of-god leapt up and ran to his axe and got hold of it;
but turning round found himself face to face with a tall woman
holding in her hand a stout staff like the limb of a tree.&nbsp;
She was calm and smiling, though forsooth it was she who had
stricken the stroke and stayed the sword from his throat.&nbsp;
His hand and axe dropped down to his side when he saw what it was
that faced him, and that the woman was young and fair; so he
spake to her and said:
&lsquo;What aileth, maiden? is this man thy foe? doth he
oppress thee? shall I slay him?&rsquo;
She laughed and said: &lsquo;Thou art open-handed in thy
proffers: he might have asked the like concerning thee but a
minute ago.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, yea,&rsquo; said Gold-mane, laughing also,
&lsquo;but he asked it not of thee.&rsquo;
&lsquo;That is sooth,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but since thou
hast asked me, I will tell thee that if thou slay him it will be
my harm as well as his; and in my country a man that taketh a
gift is not wont to break the giver&rsquo;s head with it
straightway.&nbsp; The man is my brother, O stranger, and
presently, if thou wilt, thou mayst be eating at the same board
with him.&nbsp; Or if thou wilt, thou mayst go thy ways unhurt
into the wood.&nbsp; But I had liefer of the twain that thou wert
in our house to-night; for thou hast a wrong against
us.&rsquo;
Her voice was sweet and clear, and she spake the last words
kindly, and drew somewhat nigher to Gold-mane.&nbsp; Therewithal
the smitten man sat up, and put his hand to his head, and quoth
he:
&lsquo;Angry is my sister! good it is to wear the helm abroad
when she shaketh the nut-trees.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;it is thy luck that thou
wert bare-headed, else had I been forced to smite thee on the
face.&nbsp; Thou churl, since when hath it been our wont to
thrust knives into a guest, who is come of great kin, a man of
gentle heart and fair face?&nbsp; Come hither and handsel him
self-doom for thy fool&rsquo;s onset!&rsquo;
p. 38The man
rose to his feet and said: &lsquo;Well, sister, least said,
soonest mended.&nbsp; A clout on the head is worse than a
woman&rsquo;s chiding; but since ye have given me one, ye may
forbear the other.&rsquo;
Therewith he drew near to them.&nbsp; He was a very big-made
man, most stalwarth, with dark red hair and a thin pointed beard;
his nose was straight and fine, his eyes grey and well-opened,
but somewhat fierce withal.&nbsp; Yet was he in nowise
evil-looking; he seemed some thirty summers old.&nbsp; He was
clad in a short scarlet kirtle, a goodly garment, with a hood of
like web pulled off his head on to his shoulders: he bore a great
gold ring on his left arm, and a collar of gold came down on to
his breast from under his hood.
As for the woman, she was clad in a long white linen smock,
and over it a short gown of dark blue woollen, and she had skin
shoes on her feet.
Now the man came up to Face-of-god, and took his hand and
said: &lsquo;I deemed thee a foe, and I may not have over-many
foes alive: but it seems that thou art to be a friend, and that
is well and better; so herewith I handsel thee self-doom in the
matter of the onslaught.&rsquo;
Then Face-of-god laughed and said: &lsquo;The doom is soon
given forth; against the tumble on the grass I set the clout on
the head; there is nought left over to pay to any man&rsquo;s
son.&rsquo;
Said the scarlet-clad man: &lsquo;Belike by thine eyes thou
art a true man, and wilt not bewray me.&nbsp; Now is there no
foeman here, but rather maybe a friend both now and in time to
come.&rsquo;&nbsp; Therewith he cast his arms about Face-of-god
and kissed him.&nbsp; But Face-of-god turned about to the woman
and said: &lsquo;Is the peace wholly made?&rsquo;
She shook her head and said soberly: &lsquo;Nay, thou art too
fair for a woman to kiss.&rsquo;
He flushed red, as his wont was when a woman praised him; yet
was his heart full of pleasure and well-liking.&nbsp; But she
laid her hand on his shoulder and said: &lsquo;Now is it for thee
to choose p.
39betwixt the wild-wood and the hall, and whether thou
wilt be a guest or a wayfarer this night.&rsquo;
As she touched him there took hold of him a sweetness of
pleasure he had never felt erst, and he answered: &lsquo;I will
be thy guest and not thy stranger.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Come then,&rsquo; she said, and took his hand in hers,
so that he scarce felt the earth under his feet, as they went all
three together toward the house in the gathering dusk, while
eastward where the peaks of the great mountains dipped was a
light that told of the rising of the moon.
CHAPTER VI.&nbsp; OF FACE-OF-GOD AND THOSE
MOUNTAIN-DWELLERS.
A yard or two from the threshold
Gold-mane hung back a moment, entangled in some such misgiving as
a man is wont to feel when he is just about to do some new deed,
but is not yet deep in the story; his new friends noted that, for
they smiled each in their own way, and the woman drew her hand
away from his.&nbsp; Face-of-god held out his still as though to
take hers again, and therewithal he changed countenance and said
as though he had stayed but to ask that question:
&lsquo;Tell me thy name, tall man; and thou, fair woman, tell
me thine; for how can we talk together else?&rsquo;
The man laughed outright and said: &lsquo;The young chieftain
thinks that this house also should be his!&nbsp; Nay, young man,
I know what is in thy thought, be not ashamed that thou art wary;
and be assured!&nbsp; We shall hurt thee no more than thou hast
been hurt.&nbsp; Now as to my name; the name that was born with
me is gone: the name that was given me hath been taken from me:
now I belike must give myself a name, and that shall be
Wild-wearer; but it may be that thou thyself shalt one day give
me another, and call me Guest.&rsquo;
p. 40His
sister gazed at him solemnly as he spoke, and Face-of-god
beholding her the while, deemed that her beauty grew and grew
till she seemed as aweful as a Goddess; and into his mind it came
that this over-strong man and over-lovely woman were nought
mortal, and they withal dealing with him as father and mother
deal with a wayward child: then for a moment his heart failed
him, and he longed for the peace of Burgdale, and even the lonely
wood.&nbsp; But therewith she turned to him and let her hand come
into his again, and looked kindly on him and said: &lsquo;And as
for me, call me the Friend; the name is good and will serve for
many things.&rsquo;
He looked down from her face and his eyes lighted on her hand,
and when he noted even amid the evening dusk how fair and lovely
it was fashioned, and yet as though it were deft in the crafts
that the daughters of menfolk use, his fear departed, and the
pleasure of his longing filled his heart, and he drew her hand to
him to kiss it; but she held it back.&nbsp; Then he said:
&lsquo;It is the custom of the Dale to all women.&rsquo;
So she let him kiss her hand, heeding the kiss nothing, and
said soberly:
&lsquo;Then art thou of Burgdale, and if it were lawful to
guess, I would say that thy name is Face-of-god, of the House of
the Face.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Even so it is,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but in the Dale
those that love me do mostly call me Gold-mane.&rsquo;
&lsquo;It is well named,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and seldom
wilt thou be called otherwise, for thou wilt be
well-beloved.&nbsp; But come in now, Gold-mane, for night is at
hand, and here have we meat and lodging such as an hungry and
weary man may take; though we be broken people, dwellers in the
waste.&rsquo;
Therewith she led him gently over the threshold into the hall,
and it seemed to him as if she were the fairest and the noblest
of all the Queens of ancient story.
When he was in the house he looked and saw that, rough as  a
name="page41">p. 41it was
without it lacked not fairness within.&nbsp; The floor was of
hard-trodden earth strewn with pine-twigs, and with here and
there brown bearskins laid on it: there was a standing table near
the upper end athwart the hall, and a days beyond that, but no
endlong table.&nbsp; Gold-mane looked to the shut-beds, and saw
that they were large and fair, though there were but a few of
them; and at the lower end was a loft for a sleeping chamber
dight very fairly with broidered cloths.&nbsp; The hangings on
the walls, though they left some places bare which were hung with
fresh boughs, were fairer than any he had ever seen, so that he
deemed that they must come from far countries and the City of
Cities: therein were images wrought of warriors and fair women of
old time and their dealings with the Gods and the Giants, and
Wondrous wights; and he deemed that this was the story of some
great kindred, and that their token and the sign of their banner
must needs be the Wood-wolf, for everywhere was it wrought in
these pictured webs.&nbsp; Perforce he looked long and earnestly
at these fair things, for the hall was not dark yet, because the
brands on the hearth were flaming their last, and when
Wild-wearer beheld him so gazing, he stood up and looked too for
a moment, and then smote his right hand on the hilt of his sword,
and turned away and strode up and down the hall as one in angry
thought.
But the woman, even the Friend, bestirred herself for the
service of the guest, and brought water for his hands and feet,
and when she had washed him, bore him the wine of Welcome and
drank to him and bade him drink; and he all the while was
shamefaced; for it was to him as if one of the Ladies of the
Heavenly Burg were doing him service.&nbsp; Then she went away by
a door at the lower end of the hall, and Wild-wearer came and sat
down by Gold-mane, and fell a-talking with him about the ways of
the Dalesmen, and their garths, and the pastures and growths
thereof; and what temper the carles themselves were of; which
were good men, which were ill, which was loved and which scorned;
no otherwise than if he had been the goodman of some neighbouring
p. 42dale; and
Gold-mane told him whatso he knew, for he saw no harm
therein.
After a while the outer door opened, and there came in a woman
of some five-and-twenty winters, trimly and strongly built;
short-skirted she was and clad as a hunter, with a bow in her
hand and a quiver at her back: she unslung a pouch, which she
emptied at Wild-wearer&rsquo;s feet of a leash of hares and two
brace of mountain grouse; of Face-of-god she took but little
heed.
Said Wild-wearer: &lsquo;This is good for to-morrow, not for
to-day; the meat is well-nigh on the board.&rsquo;
Then Gold-mane smiled, for he called to mind his home-coming
of yesterday.&nbsp; But the woman said:
&lsquo;The fault is not mine; she told me of the coming guest
but three hours agone.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Ay?&rsquo; said Wild-wearer, &lsquo;she looked for a
guest then?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, certes,&rsquo; said the woman, &lsquo;else why
went I forth this afternoon, as wearied as I was with
yesterday?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said Wild-wearer, &lsquo;get to thy
due work or go play; I meddle not with meat! and for thee all
jests are as bitter earnest.&rsquo;
&lsquo;And with thee, chief,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;it is no
otherwise; surely I am made on thy model.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Thy tongue is longer, friend,&rsquo; said he;
&lsquo;now tarry if thou wilt, and if the supper&rsquo;s service
craveth thee not.&rsquo;
She turned away with one keen look at Face-of-god, and
departed through the door at the lower end of the hall.
By this time the hall was dusk, for there were no candles
there, and the hearth-fire was but smouldering.&nbsp; Wild-wearer
sat silent and musing now, and Face-of-god spake not, for he was
deep in wild and happy dreams.&nbsp; At last the lower door
opened and the fair woman came into the hall with a torch in
either hand, after whom came the huntress, now clad in a dark
blue kirtle, and an old woman yet straight and hale; and these
twain bore in the victuals and the table-gear.&nbsp; Then the
three fell to dighting the  span
class="pagenum">p. 43board, and when it was all ready, and
Gold-mane and Wild-wearer were set down to it, and with them the
fair woman and the huntress, the old woman threw good store of
fresh brands on the hearth, so that the light shone into every
corner; and even therewith the outer door opened, and four more
men entered, whereof one was old, but big and stalwarth, the
other three young: they were all clad roughly in sheep-brown
weed, but had helms upon their heads and spears in their hands
and great swords girt to their sides; and they seemed doughty men
and ready for battle.&nbsp; One of the young men cast down by the
door the carcass of a big-horned mountain sheep, and then they
all trooped off to the out-bower by the lower door, and came back
presently fairly clad and without their weapons.&nbsp;
Wild-wearer nodded to them kindly, and they sat at table paying
no more heed to Face-of-god than to cast him a nod for
salutation.
Then said the old woman to them: &lsquo;Well, lads, have ye
been doing or sleeping?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Sleeping, mother,&rsquo; said one of the young men,
&lsquo;as was but due after last night was, and to-morrow shall
be.&rsquo;
Said the huntress: &lsquo;Hold thy peace, Wood-wise, and let
thy tongue help thy teeth to deal with thy meat; for this is not
the talking hour.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay, Bow-may,&rsquo; said another of the swains,
&lsquo;since here is a new man, now is the time to talk to
him.&rsquo;
Said the huntress: &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis thine hands that talk
best, Wood-wont; it is not they that shall bring thee to
shame.&rsquo;
Spake the third: &lsquo;What have we to do with shame here,
far away from dooms and doomers, and elders, and wardens, and
guarded castles?&nbsp; If the new man listeth to speak, let him
speak; or to fight, then let him; it shall ever be man to
man.&rsquo;
Then spake the old woman: &lsquo;Son Wood-wicked, hold thy
peace, and forget the steel that ever eggeth thee on to
draw.&rsquo;
Therewith she set the last matters on the board, while the
three swains sat and eyed Gold-mane somewhat fiercely, now that
p. 44words had
stirred them, and he had sat there saying nothing, as one who was
better than they, and contemned them; but now spake
Wild-wearer:
&lsquo;Whoso hungreth let him eat!&nbsp; Whoso would slumber,
let him to bed.&nbsp; But he who would bicker, it must needs be
with me.&nbsp; Here is a man of the Dale, who hath sought the
wood in peace, and hath found us.&nbsp; His hand is ready and his
heart is guileless: if ye fear him, run away to the wood, and
come back when he is gone; but none shall mock him while I sit
by: now, lads, be merry and blithe with the guest.&rsquo;
Then the young men greeted Gold-mane, and the old man said:
&lsquo;Art thou of Burgstead? then wilt thou be of the House of
the Face, and thy name will be Face-of-god; for that man is
called the fairest of the Dale, and there shall be none fairer
than thou.&rsquo;
Face-of-god laughed and said: &lsquo;There be but few mirrors
in Burgdale, and I have no mind to journey west to the cities to
see what manner of man I be: that were ill husbandry.&nbsp; But
now I have heard the names of the three swains, tell me thy name,
father!&rsquo;
Spake the huntress: &lsquo;This is my father&rsquo;s brother,
and his name is Wood-father; or ye shall call him so: and I am
called Bow-may because I shoot well in the bow: and this old
carline is my eme&rsquo;s wife, and now belike my mother, if I
need one.&nbsp; But thou, fair-faced Dalesman, little dost thou
need a mirror in the Dale so long as women abide there; for their
faces shall be instead of mirrors to tell thee whether thou be
fair and lovely.&rsquo;
Thereat they all laughed and fell to their victual, which was
abundant, of wood-venison and mountain-fowl, but of bread was no
great plenty; wine lacked not, and that of the best; and
Gold-mane noted that the cups and the apparel of the horns and
mazers were not of gold nor gilded copper, but of silver; and he
marvelled thereat, for in the Dale silver was rare.
So they ate and drank, and Gold-mane looked ever on the
Friend, and spake much with her, and he deemed her friendly  a
name="page45">p. 45indeed, and
she seemed most pleased when he spoke best, and led him on to do
so.&nbsp; Wild-wearer was but of few words, and those somewhat
harsh; yet was he as a man striving to be courteous and blithe;
but of the others Bow-may was the greatest speaker.
Wild-wearer called healths to the Sun, and the Moon, and the
Hosts of Heaven; to the Gods of the Earth; to the Woodwights; and
to the Guest.&nbsp; Other healths also he called, the meaning of
which was dark to Gold-mane; to wit, the Jaws of the Wolf; the
Silver Arm; the Red Hand; the Golden Bushel; and the Ragged
Sword.&nbsp; But when he asked the Friend concerning these names
what they might signify, she shook her head and answered not.
At last Wild-wearer cried out: &lsquo;Now, lads, the night
weareth and the guest is weary: therefore whoso of you hath in
him any minstrelsy, now let him make it, for later on it shall be
over-late.&rsquo;
Then arose Wood-wont and went to his shut-bed and groped
therein, and took from out of it a fiddle in its case; and he
opened the case and drew from it a very goodly fiddle, and he
stood on the floor amidst of the hall and Bow-may his cousin with
him; and he laid his bow on the fiddle and woke up song in it,
and when it was well awake she fell a-singing, and he to
answering her song, and at the last all they of the house sang
together; and this is the meaning of the words which they
sang:
She singeth.
Now is the rain upon the day,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And every water&rsquo;s wide;
Why busk ye then to wear the way,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And whither will ye ride?
He singeth.
Our kine are on the eyot still,
&nbsp;&nbsp; The eddies lap them round;
p. 46All dykes
the wind-worn waters fill,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And waneth grass and ground.
She singeth.
O ride ye to the river&rsquo;s brim
&nbsp;&nbsp; In war-weed fair to see?
Or winter waters will ye swim
&nbsp;&nbsp; In hauberks to the knee?
He singeth.
Wild is the day, and dim with rain,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our sheep are warded ill;
The wood-wolves gather for the plain,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their ravening maws to fill.
She singeth.
Nay, what is this, and what have ye,
&nbsp;&nbsp; A hunter&rsquo;s band, to bear
The Banner of our Battle-glee
&nbsp;&nbsp; The skulking wolves to scare?
He singeth.
O women, when we wend our ways
&nbsp;&nbsp; To deal with death and dread,
The Banner of our Fathers&rsquo; Days
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must flap the wind o&rsquo;erhead.
She singeth.
Ah, for the maidens that ye leave!
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who now shall save the hay?
What grooms shall kiss our lips at eve,
&nbsp;&nbsp; When June hath mastered May?
He singeth.
The wheat is won, the seed is sown,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here toileth many a maid,
p. 47And ere
the hay knee-deep hath grown
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your grooms the grass shall wade.
They sing all together.
Then fair befall the mountain-side
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereon the play shall be!
And fair befall the summer-tide
&nbsp;&nbsp; That whoso lives shall see.
Face-of-god thought the song goodly, but to the others it was
well known.&nbsp; Then said Wood-father:
&lsquo;O foster-son, thy foster-brother hath sung well for a
wood abider; but we are deeming that his singing shall be but as
a starling to a throstle matched against thy new-come
guest.&nbsp; Therefore, Dalesman, sing us a song of the Dale, and
if ye will, let it be of gardens and pleasant houses of stone,
and fair damsels therein, and swains with them who toil not
over-much for a scant livelihood, as do they of the waste, whose
heads may not be seen in the Holy Places.&rsquo;
Said Gold-mane: &lsquo;Father, it is ill to set the words of a
lonely man afar from his kin against the song that cometh from
the heart of a noble house; yet may I not gainsay thee, but will
sing to thee what I may call to mind, and it is called the Song
of the Ford.&rsquo;
Therewith he sang in a sweet and clear voice: and this is the
meaning of his words:
In hay-tide, through the day new-born,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the meads we come;
Our hauberks brush the blossomed corn
&nbsp;&nbsp; A furlong short of home.
Ere yet the gables we behold
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forth flasheth the red sun,
And smites our fallow helms and cold
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though all the fight be done.
p.
48In this last mend of mowing-grass
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet doth the clover smell,
Crushed neath our feet red with the pass
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where hell was blent with hell.
And now the willowy stream is nigh,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Down wend we to the ford;
No shafts across its fishes fly,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor flasheth there a sword.
But lo! what gleameth on the bank
&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the water wan,
As when our blood the mouse-ear drank
&nbsp;&nbsp; And red the river ran?
Nay, hasten to the ripple clear,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Look at the grass beyond!
Lo ye the dainty band and dear
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of maidens fair and fond!
Lo how they needs must take the stream!
&nbsp;&nbsp; The water hides their feet;
On fair kind arms the gold doth gleam,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And midst the ford we meet.
Up through the garden two and two,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And on the flowers we drip;
Their wet feet kiss the morning dew
&nbsp;&nbsp; As lip lies close to lip.
Here now we sing; here now we stay:
&nbsp;&nbsp; By these grey walls we tell
The love that lived from out the fray,
&nbsp;&nbsp; The love that fought and fell.
When he was done they all said that he had sung well, and  a
name="page49">p. 49that the song
was sweet.&nbsp; Yet did Wild-wearer smile somewhat; and Bow-may
said outright: &lsquo;Soft is the song, and hath been made by
lads and minstrels rather than by warriors.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay, kinswoman,&rsquo; said Wood-father, &lsquo;thou
art hard to please; the guest is kind, and hath given us that I
asked for, and I give him all thanks therefor.&rsquo;
Face-of-god smiled, but he heeded little what they said, for
as he sang he had noted that the Friend looked kindly on him; and
he thought he saw that once or twice she put out her hand as if
to touch him, but drew it back again each time.&nbsp; She spake
after a little and said:
&lsquo;Here now hath been a stream of song running betwixt the
Mountain and the Dale even as doth a river; and this is good to
come between our dreams of what hath been and what shall
be.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then she turned to Gold-mane, and said to him
scarce loud enough for all to hear:
&lsquo;Herewith I bid thee good-night, O Dalesman; and this
other word I have to thee: heed not what befalleth in the night,
but sleep thy best, for nought shall be to thy scathe.&nbsp; And
when thou wakest in the morning, if we are yet here, it is well;
but if we are not, then abide us no long while, but break thy
fast on the victual thou wilt find upon the board, and so depart
and go thy ways home.&nbsp; And yet thou mayst look to it to see
us again before thou diest.&rsquo;
Therewith she held out her hand to him, and he took it and
kissed it; and she went to her chamber-aloft at the lower end of
the hall.&nbsp; And when she was gone, once more he had a deeming
of her that she was of the kindred of the Gods.&nbsp; At her
departure him-seemed that the hall grew dull and small and smoky,
and the night seemed long to him and doubtful the coming of the
day.
p.
50CHAPTER VII.&nbsp; FACE-OF-GOD TALKETH WITH THE FRIEND
ON THE MOUNTAIN.
So now went all men to bed; and
Face-to-god&rsquo;s shut-bed was over against the outer door and
toward the lower end of the hall, and on the panel about it hung
the weapons and shields of men.&nbsp; Fair was that chamber and
roomy, and the man was weary despite his eagerness, so that he
went to sleep as soon as his head touched the pillow; but within
a while (he deemed about two hours after midnight) he was awaked
by the clattering of the weapons against the panel, and the sound
of men&rsquo;s hands taking them down; and when he was fully
awake, he heard withal men going up and down the house as if on
errands: but he called to mind what the Friend had said to him,
and he did not so much as turn himself toward the hall; for he
said: &lsquo;Belike these men are outlaws and Wolves of the Holy
Places, yet by seeming they are good fellows and nought churlish,
nor have I to do with taking up the feud against them.&nbsp; I
will abide the morning.&nbsp; Yet meseemeth that she drew me
hither: for what cause?&rsquo;
Therewith he fell asleep again, and dreamed no more.&nbsp; But
when he awoke the sun was shining broad upon the hall-floor, and
he sat up and listened, but could hear no sound save the moaning
of the wind in the pine-boughs and the chatter of the starlings
about the gables of the house; and the place seemed so exceeding
lonely to him that he was in a manner feared by that
loneliness.
Then he arose and clad himself, and went forth into the hall
and gazed about him, and at first he deemed indeed that there was
no one therein.&nbsp; But at last he looked and beheld the upper
gable and there underneath a most goodly hanging was the glorious
shape of a woman sitting on a bench covered over with a cloth of
gold and silver; and he looked and looked to see if the woman
might stir, and if she were alive, and she turned her head toward
him, and lo it was the Friend; and his heart rose to his mouth
for wonder and fear and desire.&nbsp; For now he doubted whether
the p. 51other
folk were aught save shows and shadows, and she the Goddess who
had fashioned them out of nothing for his bewilderment, presently
to return to nothing.
Yet whatever he might fear or doubt, he went up the hall
towards her till he was quite nigh to her, and there he stood
silent, wondering at her beauty and desiring her kindness.
Grey-eyed she was like her brother; but her hair the colour of
red wheat: her lips full and red, her chin round, her nose fine
and straight.&nbsp; Her hands and all her body fashioned
exceeding sweetly and delicately; yet not as if she were an image
of which the like might be found if the craftsman were but deft
enough to make a perfect thing, but in such a way that there was
none like to her for those that had eyes to behold her as she
was; and none could ever be made like to her, even by such a
master-craftsman as could fashion a body without a blemish.
She was clad in a white smock, whose hems were broidered with
gold wire and precious gems of the Mountains, and over that a
gown woven of gold and silver: scarce hath the world such
another.&nbsp; On her head was a fillet of gold and gems, and
there were wondrous gold rings on her arms: her feet lay bare on
the dark grey wolf-skin that was stretched before her.
She smiled kindly upon his solemn and troubled face, and her
voice sounded strangely familiar to him coming from all that
loveliness, as she said: &lsquo;Hail, Face-of-god! here am I left
alone, although I deemed last night that I should be gone with
the others.&nbsp; Therefore am I fain to show myself to thee in
fairer array than yesternight; for though we dwell in the
wild-wood, from the solace of folk, yet are we not of
thralls&rsquo; blood.&nbsp; But come now, I bid thee break thy
fast and talk with me a little while; and then shalt thou depart
in peace.&rsquo;
Spake Face-of-god, and his voice trembled as he spake:
&lsquo;What art thou?&nbsp; Last night I deemed at whiles once
and again that thou wert of the Gods; and now that I behold thee
thus, and it is broad daylight, and of those others is no more to
be seen p.
52than if they had never lived, I cannot but deem that it
is even so, and that thou comest from the City that shall never
perish.&nbsp; Now if thou be a goddess, I have nought to pray
thee, save to slay me speedily if thou hast a mind for my
death.&nbsp; But if thou art a woman&mdash;&rsquo;
She broke in: &lsquo;Gold-mane, stay thy prayer and hold thy
peace for this time, lest thou repent when repentance availeth
not.&nbsp; And this I say because I am none of the Gods nor akin
to them, save far off through the generations, as art thou also,
and all men of goodly kindred.&nbsp; Now I bid thee eat thy meat,
since &rsquo;tis ill talking betwixt a full man and a fasting;
and I have dight it myself with mine own hands; for Bow-may and
the Wood-mother went away with the rest three hours before
dawn.&nbsp; Come sit and eat as thou hast a hardy heart; as
forsooth thou shouldest do if I were a very goddess.&nbsp; Take
heed, friend, lest I take thee for some damsel of the lower Dale
arrayed in Earl&rsquo;s garments.&rsquo;
She laughed therewith, and leaned toward him and put forth her
hand to him, and he took it and caressed it; and the exceeding
beauty of her body and of the raiment which was as it were a part
of her and her loveliness, made her laughter and her friendly
words strange to him, as if one did not belong to the other; as
in a dream it might be.&nbsp; Nevertheless he did as she bade
him, and sat at the board and ate, while she leaned forward on
the arm of her chair and spake to him in friendly wise.&nbsp; And
he wondered as she spake that she knew so much of him and his:
and he kept saying to himself: &lsquo;She drew me hither;
wherefore did she so?&rsquo;
But she said: &lsquo;Gold-mane, how fareth thy father the
Alderman? is he as good a wright as ever?&rsquo;
He told her: Yea, that ever was his hammer on the iron, the
copper, and the gold, and that no wright in the Dale was as deft
as he.
Said she: &lsquo;Would he not have had thee seek to the
Cities, to see the ways of the outer world?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said he.
p. 53She
said: &lsquo;Thou wert wise to naysay that offer; thou shalt have
enough to do in the Dale and round about it in twelve
months&rsquo; time.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Art thou foresighted?&rsquo; said he.
&lsquo;Folk have called me so,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but I
wot not.&nbsp; But thy brother Hall-face, how fareth
he?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Well;&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;to my deeming he is the
Sword of our House, and the Warrior of the Dale, if the days were
ready for him.&rsquo;
&lsquo;And Stone-face, that stark ancient,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;doth he still love the Folk of the Dale, and hate all
other folks?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I know not that, but I know
that he loveth as, and above all me and my father.&rsquo;
Again she spake: &lsquo;How fareth the Bride, the fair maid to
whom thou art affianced?&rsquo;
As she spake, it was to him as if his heart was stricken cold;
but he put a force upon himself, and neither reddened nor
whitened, nor changed countenance in any way; so he answered:
&lsquo;She was well the eve of yesterday.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he
remembered what she was, and her beauty and valour, and he
constrained himself to say: &lsquo;Each day she groweth fairer;
there is no man&rsquo;s son and no daughter of woman that does
not love her; yea, the very beasts of field and fold love
her.&rsquo;
The Friend looked at him steadily and spake no word, but a red
flush mounted to her cheeks and brow and changed her face; and he
marvelled thereat; for still he misdoubted that she was a
Goddess.&nbsp; But it passed away in a moment, and she smiled and
said:
&lsquo;Guest, thou seemest to wonder that I know concerning
thee and the Dale and thy kindred.&nbsp; But now shalt thou wot
that I have been in the Dale once and again, and my brother
oftener still; and that I have seen thee before
yesterday.&rsquo;
&lsquo;That is marvellous,&rsquo; quoth he, &lsquo;for sure am
I that I have not seen thee.&rsquo;
p.
54&lsquo;Yet thou hast seen me,&rsquo; she said;
&lsquo;yet not altogether as I am now;&rsquo; and therewith she
smiled on him friendly.
&lsquo;How is this?&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;art thou a
skin-changer?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, in a fashion,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Hearken! dost thou perchance remember a day of last summer
when there was a market holden in Burgstead; and there stood in
the way over against the House of the Face a tall old carle who
was trucking deer-skins for diverse gear; and with him was a
queen, tall and dark-skinned, somewhat well-liking, her hair
bound up in a white coif so that none of it could be seen; by the
token that she had a large stone of mountain blue set in silver
stuck in the said coif?&rsquo;
As she spoke she set her hand to her bosom and drew something
from it, and held forth her hand to Gold-mane, and lo amidst the
palm the great blue stone set in silver.
&lsquo;Wondrous as a dream is this,&rsquo; said Face-of-god,
&lsquo;for these twain I remember well, and what
followed.&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;I will tell thee that.&nbsp; There came a man
of the Shepherd-Folk, drunk or foolish, or both, who began to
chaffer with the big carle; but ever on the queen were his eyes
set, and presently he put forth his hand to her to clip her,
whereon the big carle hove up his fist and smote him, so that he
fell to earth noseling.&nbsp; Then ran the folk together to hale
off the stranger and help the shepherd, and it was like that the
stranger should be mishandled.&nbsp; Then there thrust through
the press a young man with yellow hair and grey eyes, who cried
out, &ldquo;Fellows, let be!&nbsp; The stranger had the right of
it; this is no matter to make a quarrel or a court case of.&nbsp;
Let the market go on!&nbsp; This man and maid are true
folk.&rdquo;&nbsp; So when the folk heard the young man and his
bidding, they forebore and let the carle and the queen be, and
the shepherd went his ways little hurt.&nbsp; Now then, who was
this young man?&rsquo;
Quoth Gold-mane: &lsquo;It was even I, and meseemeth it was no
great deed to do.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and the big carle was my
brother, and the tall queen, it was myself.&rsquo;
p.
55&lsquo;How then,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;for she was as
dark-skinned as a dwarf, and thou so bright and fair?&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;Well, if the woods are good for nothing else,
yet are they good for the growing of herbs, and I know the craft
of simpling; and with one of these herbs had I stained my skin
and my brother&rsquo;s also.&nbsp; And it showed the darker
beneath the white coif.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but why must ye needs fare
in feigned shapes?&nbsp; Ye would have been welcome guests in the
Dale howsoever ye had come.&rsquo;
&lsquo;I may not tell thee hereof as now,&rsquo; said she.
Said Gold-mane: &lsquo;Yet thou mayst belike tell me wherefore
was that thy brother desired to slay me yesterday, if he knew me,
who I was.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Gold-mane,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;thou art not slain,
so little story need be made of that: for the rest, belike he
knew thee not at that moment.&nbsp; So it falls with us, that we
look to see foes rather than friends in the wild-woods.&nbsp;
Many uncouth things are therein.&nbsp; Moreover, I must tell thee
of my brother that whiles he is as the stalled bull late let
loose, and nothing is good to him save battle and onset; and then
is he blind and knows not friend from foe.&rsquo;&nbsp; Said
Face-of-god: &lsquo;Thou hast asked of me and mine; wilt thou not
tell me of thee and thine?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;not as now; thou must
betake thee to the way.&nbsp; Whither wert thou wending when thou
happenedst upon us?&rsquo;
He said: &lsquo;I know not; I was seeking something, but I
knew not what&mdash;meseemeth that now I have found
it.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Art thou for the great mountains seeking gems?&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yet go not thither to-day: for who knoweth
what thou shalt meet there that shall be thy foe?&rsquo;
He said: &lsquo;Nay, nay; I have nought to do but to abide
here as long as I may, looking upon thee and hearkening to thy
voice.&rsquo;
Her eyes were upon his, but yet she did not seem to see him,
and for a while she answered not; and still he wondered that mere
words should come from so fair a thing; for whether she moved  a
name="page56">p. 56foot, or
hand, or knee, or turned this way or that, each time she stirred
it was a caress to his very heart.
He spake again: &lsquo;May I not abide here a while?&nbsp;
What scathe may be in that?&rsquo;
&lsquo;It is not so,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;thou must depart,
and that straightway: lo, there lieth thy spear which the
Wood-mother hath brought in from the waste.&nbsp; Take thy gear
to thee and wend thy ways.&nbsp; Have patience!&nbsp; I will lead
thee to the place where we first met and there give thee
farewell.&rsquo;
Therewith she arose and he also perforce, and when they came
to the doorway she stepped across the threshold and then turned
back and gave him her hand and so led him forth, the sun flashing
back from her golden raiment.&nbsp; Together they went over the
short grey grass of that hillside till they came to the place
where he had arisen from that wrestle with her brother.&nbsp;
There she stayed him and said:
&lsquo;This is the place; here must we part.&rsquo;
But his heart failed him and he faltered in his speech as he
said:
&lsquo;When shall I see thee again?&nbsp; Wilt thou slay me if
I seek to thee hither once more?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Hearken,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;autumn is now a-dying
into winter: let winter and its snows go past: nor seek to me
hither; for me thou should&rsquo;st not find, but thy death thou
mightest well fall in with; and I would not that thou shouldest
die.&nbsp; When winter is gone, and spring is on the land, if
thou hast not forgotten us thou shalt meet us again.&nbsp; Yet
shalt thou go further than this Woodland Hall.&nbsp; In Shadowy
Vale shalt thou seek to me then, and there will I talk with
thee.&rsquo;
&lsquo;And where,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;is Shadowy Vale? for
thereof have I never heard tell.&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;The token when it cometh to thee shall show
thee thereof and the way thither.&nbsp; Art thou a babbler,
Gold-mane?&rsquo;
He said: &lsquo;I have won no prize for babbling
hitherto.&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;If thou listest to babble concerning what
hath befallen p.
57thee on the Mountain, so do, and repent it once only,
that is, thy life long.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Why should I say any word thereof?&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Dost thou not know the sweetness of such a tale
untold?&rsquo;
He spake as one who is somewhat wrathful, and she answered
humbly and kindly:
&lsquo;Well is that.&nbsp; Bide thou the token that shall lead
thee to Shadowy Vale.&nbsp; Farewell now.&rsquo;
She drew her hand from his, and turned and went her ways
swiftly to the house: he could not choose but gaze on her as she
went glittering-bright and fair in that grey place of the
mountains, till the dark doorway swallowed up her beauty.&nbsp;
Then he turned away and took the path through the pine-woods,
muttering to himself as he went:
&lsquo;What thing have I done now that hitherto I had not
done?&nbsp; What manner of man am I to-day other than the man I
was yesterday?&rsquo;
CHAPTER VIII.&nbsp; FACE-OF-GOD COMETH HOME AGAIN TO
BURGSTEAD.
Face-of-God went back through the
wood by the way he had come, paying little heed to the things
about him.&nbsp; For whatever he thought of strayed not one whit
from the image of the Fair Woman of the Mountain-side.
He went through the wood swiftlier than yesterday, and made no
stay for noon or aught else, nor did he linger on the road when
he was come into the Dale, either to speak to any or to note what
they did.&nbsp; So he came to the House of the Face about dusk,
and found no man within the hall either carle or queen.&nbsp; So
he cried out on the folk, and there came in a damsel of the
house, whom he greeted kindly and she him again.&nbsp; He bade
her bring the washing-water, and she did so and washed his feet
and his p.
58hands.&nbsp; She was a fair maid enough, as were most in
the Dale, but he heeded her little; and when she was done he
kissed not her cheek for her pains, as his wont was, but let her
go her ways unthanked.&nbsp; But he went to his shut-bed and
opened his chest, and drew fair raiment from it, and did off his
wood-gear, and did on him a goodly scarlet kirtle fairly
broidered, and a collar with gems of price therein, and other
braveries.&nbsp; And when he was so attired he came out into the
hall, and there was old Stone-face standing by the hearth, which
was blazing brightly with fresh brands, so that things were clear
to see.
Stone-face noted Gold-mane&rsquo;s gay raiment, for he was not
wont to wear such attire, save on the feasts and high days when
he behoved to.&nbsp; So the old man smiled and said:
&lsquo;Welcome back from the Wood!&nbsp; But what is it?&nbsp;
Hast thou been wedded there, or who hath made thee Earl and
King?&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;Foster-father, sooth it is that I
have been to the wood, but there have I seen nought of manfolk
worse than myself.&nbsp; Now as to my raiment, needs must I keep
it from the moth.&nbsp; And I am weary withal, and this kirtle is
light and easy to me.&nbsp; Moreover, I look to see the Bride
here again, and I would pleasure her with the sight of gay
raiment upon me.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Stone-face, &lsquo;hast thou not seen
some woman in the wood arrayed like the image of a God? and hath
she not bidden thee thus to worship her to-night?&nbsp; For I
know that such wights be in the wood, and that such is their
wont.&rsquo;
Said Gold-mane: &lsquo;I worship nought save the Gods and the
Fathers.&nbsp; Nor saw I in the wood any such as thou
sayest.&rsquo;
Therewith Stone-face shook his head; but after a while he
said:
&lsquo;Art thou for the wood to-morrow?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Gold-mane angrily, knitting his
brows.
&lsquo;The morrow of to-morrow,&rsquo; said Stone-face,
&lsquo;is the day when we look to see the Westland merchants:
after all, wilt thou not go hence with them when they wend their
ways back before the first snows fall?&rsquo;
p.
59&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I have no mind to it,
fosterer; cease egging me on hereto.&rsquo;
Then Stone-face shook his head again, and looked on him long,
and muttered: &lsquo;To the wood wilt thou go to-morrow or next
day; or some day when doomed is thine undoing.&rsquo;
Therewith entered the service and torches, and presently after
came the Alderman with Hall-face; and Iron-face greeted his son
and said to him: &lsquo;Thou hast not hit the time to do on thy
gay raiment, for the Bride will not be here to-night; she bideth
still at the Feast at the Apple-tree House: or wilt thou be
there, son?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;I am
over-weary.&nbsp; And as for my raiment, it is well; it is for
thine honour and the honour of the name.&rsquo;
So to table they went, and Iron-face asked his son of his ways
again, and whether he was quite fixed in his mind not to go down
to the Plain and the Cities: &lsquo;For,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;the morrow of to-morrow shall the merchants be here, and
this were great news for them if the son of the Alderman should
be their faring-fellow back.&rsquo;
But Face-of-god answered without any haste or heat:
&lsquo;Nay, father, it may not be: fear not, thou shalt see that
I have a good will to work and live in the Dale.&rsquo;
And in good sooth, though he was a young man and loved mirth
and the ways of his own will, he was a stalwarth workman, and few
could mow a match with him in the hay-month and win it; or fell
trees as certainly and swiftly, or drive as straight and clean a
furrow through the stiff land of the lower Dale; and in other
matters also was he deft and sturdy.
CHAPTER IX.&nbsp; THOSE BRETHREN FARE TO THE YEWWOOD WITH THE
BRIDE.
Next morning Face-of-god dight
himself for work, and took his axe; for his brother Hall-face had
bidden him go down with him to the Yew-wood and cut timber there,
p. 60since he
of all men knew where to go straight to the sticks that would
quarter best for bow-staves; whereas the Alderman had the right
of hewing in that wood.&nbsp; So they went forth, those brethren,
from the House of the Face, but when they were gotten to the
gate, who should be there but the Bride awaiting them, and she
with an ass duly saddled for bearing the yew-sticks.&nbsp;
Because Hall-face had told her that he and belike Gold-mane were
going to hew in the wood, and she thought it good to be of the
company, as oft had befallen erst.&nbsp; When they met she
greeted Face-of-god and kissed him as her wont was; and he looked
upon her and saw how fair she was, and how kind and friendly were
her eyes that beheld him, and how her whole face was eager for
him as their lips parted.&nbsp; Then his heart failed him, when
he knew that he no longer desired her as she did him, and he said
within himself:
&lsquo;Would that she had been of our nighest kindred!&nbsp;
Would that I had had a sister and that this were she!&rsquo;
So the three went along the highway down the Dale, and
Hall-face and the Bride talked merrily together and laughed, for
she was happy, since she knew that Gold-mane had been to the wood
and was back safe and much as he had been before.&nbsp; So indeed
it seemed of him; for though at first he was moody and of few
words, yet presently he cursed himself for a mar-sport, and so
fell into the talk, and enforced himself to be merry; and soon he
was so indeed; for he thought: &lsquo;She drew me thither: she
hath a deed for me to do.&nbsp; I shall do the deed and have my
reward.&nbsp; Soon will the spring-tide be here, and I shall be a
young man yet when it comes.&rsquo;
So came they to the place where he had met the three maidens
yesterday; there they also turned from the highway; and as they
went down the bent, Gold-mane could not but turn his eyes on the
beauty of the Bride and the lovely ways of her body: but
presently he remembered all that had betid, and turned away again
as one who is noting what it behoves him not to note.&nbsp; And
he said to himself: &lsquo;Where art thou, Gold-mane?&nbsp; Whose
art thou?&nbsp; p.
61Yea, even if that had been but a dream that I have
dreamed, yet would that this fair woman were my
sister!&rsquo;
So came they to the Yew-wood, and the brethren fell to work,
and the Bride with them, for she was deft with the axe and strong
withal.&nbsp; But at midday they rested on the green slope
without the Yew-wood; and they ate bread and flesh and onions and
apples, and drank red wine of the Dale.&nbsp; And while they were
resting after their meat, the Bride sang to them, and her song
was a lay of time past; and here ye have somewhat of it:
&rsquo;Tis over the hill and over the dale br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Men ride from the city fast and far,
If they may have a soothfast tale,
&nbsp;&nbsp; True tidings of the host of war.
And first they hap on men-at-arms,
&nbsp;&nbsp; All clad in steel from head to foot:
Now tell true tale of the new-come harms,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the gathered hosts of the mountain-root.
Fair sirs, from murder-carles we flee,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose fashion is as the mountain-trolls&rsquo;; br
/>
No man can tell how many they be,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the voice of their host as the thunder
rolls.
They were weary men at the ending of day,
&nbsp;&nbsp; But they spurred nor stayed for longer word.
Now ye, O merchants, whither away?
&nbsp;&nbsp; What do ye there with the helm and the sword?
O we must fight for life and gear,
&nbsp;&nbsp; For our beasts are spent and our wains are
stayed,
And the host of the Mountain-men draws near,
&nbsp;&nbsp; That maketh all the world afraid.
p.
62They left the chapmen on the hill,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And through the eve and through the night
They rode to have true tidings still,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And were there on the way when the dawn was
bright.
O damsels fair, what do ye then
&nbsp;&nbsp; To loiter thus upon the way,
And have no fear of the Mountain-men,
&nbsp;&nbsp; The host of the carles that strip and slay?
O riders weary with the road,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come eat and drink on the grass hereby!
And lay you down in a fair abode
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the midday sun is broad and high;
Then unto you shall we come aback,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lead you forth to the Mountain-men,
To note their plenty and their lack,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And have true tidings there and then.
&rsquo;Tis over the hill and over the dale br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; They ride from the mountain fast and far;
And now have they learned a soothfast tale,
&nbsp;&nbsp; True tidings of the host of war.
It was summer-tide and the Month of Hay,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And men and maids must fare afield;
But we saw the place were the bow-staves lay,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the hall was hung with spear and shield.
When the moon was high we drank in the hall, br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they drank to the guests and were kind and
blithe,
And they said: Come back when the chestnuts fall,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the wine-carts wend across the hythe.
Come oft and o&rsquo;er again, they said;
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wander your ways; but we abide
p. 63For all
the world in the little stead;
&nbsp;&nbsp; For wise are we, though the world be wide.
Yea, come in arms if ye will, they said;
&nbsp;&nbsp; And despite your host shall we abide
For life or death in the little stead;
&nbsp;&nbsp; For wise are we, though the world be wide.
So she made an end and looked at the fairness of the dale
spreading wide before her, and a robin came nigh from out of a
thorn-bush and sung his song also, the sweet herald of coming
winter; and the lapwings wheeled about, black and white, above
the meadow by the river, sending forth their wheedling pipe as
they hung above the soft turf.
She felt the brothers near her, and knew their friendliness
from of old, and she was happy; nor had she looked closer at
Gold-mane would she have noted any change in him belike; for the
meat and the good wine, and the fair sunny time, and the
Bride&rsquo;s sweet voice, and the ancient song softened his
heart while it fed the desire therein.
So in a while they arose from their rest and did what was left
them of their work, and so went back to Burgstead through the
fair afternoon; by seeming all three in all content.&nbsp; But
yet Gold-mane, as from time to time he looked upon the Bride,
kept saying to himself: &lsquo;O if she had been but my sister!
sweet had the kinship been!&rsquo;
CHAPTER X.&nbsp; NEW TIDINGS IN THE DALE.
It was three days thereafter that
Gold-mane, leading an ass, went along the highway to fetch home
certain fleeces which were needed for the house from a stead a
little west of Wildlake; but he had gone scant half a mile ere he
fell in with a p.
64throng of folk going to Burgstead.&nbsp; They were of
the Shepherds; they had weapons with them, and some were clad in
coats of fence.&nbsp; They went along making a great noise, for
they were all talking each to each at the same time, and seemed
very hot and eager about some matter.&nbsp; When they saw
Gold-mane anigh, they stopped, and the throng opened as if to let
him into their midmost; so he mingled with them, and they stood
in a ring about him and an old man more ill-favoured than it was
the wont of the Dalesmen to be.
For he was long, stooping, gaunt and spindle-shanked, his
hands big and crippled with gout: his cheeks were red after an
old man&rsquo;s fashion, covered with a crimson network like a
pippin; his lips thin and not well hiding his few teeth; his nose
long like a snipe&rsquo;s neb.&nbsp; In short, a shame and a
laughing-stock to the Folk, and a man whom the kindreds had in
small esteem, and that for good reasons.
Face-of-god knew him at once for a notable close-fist and
starve-all fool of the Shepherds; and his name was now become
Penny-thumb the Lean, whatever it might once have been.
So Face-of-god greeted all men, and they him again; and he
said: &lsquo;What aileth you, neighbours?&nbsp; Your weapons, are
bare, but I see not that they be bloody.&nbsp; What is it,
goodman Penny-thumb?&rsquo;
Penny-thumb did but groan for all answer; but a stout carle
who stood by with a broad grin on his face answered and said:
&lsquo;Face-of-god, evil tidings be abroad; the strong-thieves
of the wood are astir; and some deem that the wood-wights be
helping them.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, and what is the deed they have done?&rsquo; said
Gold-mane.
Said the carle: &lsquo;Thou knowest Penny-thumb&rsquo;s
abode?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea surely,&rsquo; said Face-of-god; &lsquo;fair are
the water-meadows about it; great gain of cheese can be gotten
thence.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Hast thou been within the house?&rsquo; said the
carle.
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Gold-mane.
p. 65Then
spake Penny-thumb: &lsquo;Within is scant gear: we gather for
others to scatter; we make meat for others&rsquo;
mouths.&rsquo;
The carle laughed: &lsquo;Sooth is that,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;that there is little gear therein now; for the
strong-thieves have voided both hall and bower and
byre.&rsquo;
&lsquo;And when was that?&rsquo; said Face-of-god.
&lsquo;The night before last night,&rsquo; said the carle,
&lsquo;the door was smitten on, and when none answered it was
broken down.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; quoth Penny-thumb, &lsquo;a host entered,
and they in arms.&rsquo;
&lsquo;No host was within,&rsquo; said the carle,
&lsquo;nought but Penny-thumb and his sister and his
sister&rsquo;s son, and three carles that work for him; and one
of them, Rusty to wit, was the worst man of the
hill-country.&nbsp; These then the host whereof the goodman
telleth bound, but without doing them any scathe; and they
ransacked the house, and took away much gear; yet left
some.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Thou liest,&rsquo; said Penny-thumb; &lsquo;they took
little and left none.&rsquo;
Thereat all men laughed, for this seemed to them good game,
and another man said: &lsquo;Well, neighbour Penny-thumb, if it
was so little, thou hast done unneighbourly in giving us such a
heap of trouble about it.&rsquo;
And they laughed again, but the first carle said: &lsquo;True
it is, goodman, that thou wert exceeding eager to raise the hue
and cry after that little when we happed upon thee and thy
housemates bound in your chairs yesterday morning.&nbsp; Well,
Alderman&rsquo;s son, short is the tale to tell: we could not
fail to follow the gear, and the slot led us into the wood, and
ill is the going there for us shepherds, who are used to the bare
downs, save Rusty, who was a good woodsman and lifted the slot
for us; so he outwent us all, and ran out of sight of us, so
presently we came upon him dead-slain, with the manslayer&rsquo;s
spear in his breast.&nbsp; What then could we do but turn back
again, for now was the wood blind now Rusty was dead, and we knew
not whither to follow the fray; and the man himself was but
little loss: so back we turned, and told goodman Penny-thumb of
all this, for we had left him  span
class="pagenum">p. 66alone in his hall lamenting his gear;
so we bided to-day&rsquo;s morn, and have come out now, with our
neighbour and the spear, and the dead corpse of Rusty.&nbsp;
Stand aside, neighbours, and let the Alderman&rsquo;s son see
it.&rsquo;
They did so, and there was the corpse of a thin-faced tall
wiry man, somewhat foxy of aspect, lying on a hand-bier covered
with black cloth.
&lsquo;Yea, Face-of-god,&rsquo; said the carle, &lsquo;he is
not good to see now he is dead, yet alive was he worser: but,
look you, though the man was no good man, yet was he of our
people, and the feud is with us; so we would see the Alderman,
and do him to wit of the tidings, that he may call the neighbours
together to seek a blood-wite for Rusty and atonement for the
ransacking.&nbsp; Or what sayest thou?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Have ye the spear that ye found in Rusty?&rsquo; quoth
Gold-mane.
&lsquo;Yea verily,&rsquo; said the carle.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hither
with it, neighbours; give it to the Alderman&rsquo;s
son.&rsquo;
So the spear came into his hand, and he looked at it and
said:
&lsquo;This is no spear of the smiths&rsquo; work of the Dale,
as my father will tell you.&nbsp; We take but little keep of the
forging of spearheads here, so that they be well-tempered and
made so as to ride well on the shaft; but this head, daintily is
it wrought, the blood-trench as clean and trim as though it were
an Earl&rsquo;s sword.&nbsp; See you withal this inlaying of
runes on the steel?&nbsp; It is done with no tin or copper, but
with very silver; and these bands about the shaft be of silver
also.&nbsp; It is a fair weapon, and the owner hath a loss of it
greater than his gain in the slaying of Rusty; and he will have
left it in the wound so that he might be known hereafter, and
that he might be said not to have murdered Rusty but to have
slain him.&nbsp; Or how think ye?&rsquo;
They all said that this seemed like to be; but that if the man
who had slain Rusty were one of the ransackers they might have a
blood-wite of him, if they could find him.&nbsp; Gold-mane said
that so it was, and therewithal he gave the shepherds good-speed
and went on his way.
p. 67But
they came to Burgstead and found the Alderman, and in due time
was a Court held, and a finding uttered, and outlawry given forth
for the manslaying and the ransacking against certain men
unknown.&nbsp; As for the spear, it was laid up in the House of
the Face.
But Face-of-god pondered these matters in his mind, for such
ransackings there had been none of in late years; and he said to
himself that his friends of the Mountain must have other folk, of
which the Dalesmen knew nought, whose gear they could lift, or
how could they live in that place.&nbsp; And he marvelled that
they should risk drawing the Dalesmen&rsquo;s wrath upon them;
whereas they of the Dale were strong men not easily daunted,
albeit peaceable enough if not stirred to wrath.&nbsp; For in
good sooth he had no doubt concerning that spear, whose it was
and whence it came: for that very weapon had been leaning against
the panel of his shut-bed the night he slept on the Mountain, and
all the other spears that he saw there were more or less of the
same fashion, and adorned with silver.
Albeit all that he knew, and all that he thought of, he kept
in his own heart and said nothing of it.
So wore the autumn into early winter; and the Westland
merchants came in due time, and departed without Face-of-god,
though his father made him that offer one last time.&nbsp; He
went to and fro about his work in the Dale, and seemed to most
men&rsquo;s eyes nought changed from what he had been.&nbsp; But
the Bride noted that he saw her less often than his wont was, and
abode with her a lesser space when he met her; and she could not
think what this might mean; nor had she heart to ask him thereof,
though she was sorry and grieved, but rather withdrew her company
from him somewhat; and when she perceived that he noted it not,
and made no question of it, then was she the sorrier.
But the first winter-snow came on with a great storm of wind
from the north-east, so that no man stirred abroad who was not
compelled thereto, and those who went abroad risked life and limb
p.
68thereby.&nbsp; Next morning all was calm again, and the
snow was deep, but it did not endure long, for the wind shifted
to the southwest and the thaw came, and three days after, when
folk could fare easily again up and down the Dale, came tidings
to Burgstead and the Alderman from the Lower Dale, how a house
called Greentofts had been ransacked there, and none knew by
whom.&nbsp; Now the goodman of Greentofts was little loved of the
neighbours: he was grasping and overbearing, and had often cowed
others out of their due: he was very cross-grained, both at home
and abroad: his wife had fled from his hand, neither did his sons
find it good to abide with him: therewithal he was wealthy of
goods, a strong man and a deft man-at-arms.&nbsp; When his sons
and his wife departed from him, and none other of the Dalesmen
cared to abide with him, he went down into the Plain, and got
thence men to be with him for hire, men who were not well seen to
in their own land.&nbsp; These to the number of twelve abode with
him, and did his bidding whenso it pleased them.&nbsp; Two more
had he had who had been slain by good men of the Dale for their
masterful ways; and no blood-wite had been paid for them, because
of their ill-doings, though they had not been made outlaws.&nbsp;
This man of Greentofts was called Harts-bane after his father,
who was a great hunter.
Now the full tidings of the ransacking were these: The storm
began two hours before sunset, and an hour thereafter, when it
was quite dark, for without none could see because the wind was
at its height and the drift of the snow was hard and full, the
hall-door flew open; and at first men thought it had been the
wind, until they saw in the dimness (for all lights but the fire
on the hearth had been quenched) certain things tumbling in which
at first they deemed were wolves; but when they took swords and
staves against them, lo they were met by swords and axes, and
they saw that the seeming wolves were men with wolf-skins drawn
over them.&nbsp; So the new-comers cowed them that they threw
down their weapons, and were bound in their places; but when they
p. 69were
bound, and had had time to note who the ransackers were, they saw
that there were but six of them all told, who had cowed and bound
Harts-bane and his twelve masterful men; and this they deemed a
great shaming to them, as might well be.
So then the stead was ransacked, and those wolves took away
what they would, and went their ways through the fierce storm,
and none could tell whether they had lived or died in it; but at
least neither the men nor their prey were seen again; nor did
they leave any slot, for next morning the snow lay deep over
everything.
No doubt had Gold-mane but that these ransackers were his
friends of the Mountain; but he held his peace, abiding till the
winter should be over.
CHAPTER XI.&nbsp; MEN MAKE OATH AT BURGSTEAD ON THE HOLY
BOAR.
A week after the ransacking at
Greentofts the snow and the winter came on in earnest, and all
the Dale lay in snow, and men went on skids when they fared up
and down the Dale or on the Mountain.
All was now tidingless till Yule over, and in Burgstead was
there feasting and joyance enough; and especially at the House of
the Face was high-tide holden, and the Alderman and his sons and
Stone-face and all the kindred and all their men sat in glorious
attire within the hall; and many others were there of the best of
the kindreds of Burgstead who had been bidden.
Face-of-god sat between his father and Stone-face; and he
looked up and down the tables and the hall and saw not the Bride,
and his heart misgave him because she was not there, and he
wondered what had befallen and if she were sick of sorrow.
But Iron-face beheld him how he gazed about, and he laughed;
for he was exceeding merry that night and fared as a young
man.&nbsp; p.
70Then he said to his son: &lsquo;Whom seekest thou, son?
is there someone lacking?&rsquo;
Face-of-god reddened as one who lies unused to it, and
said:
&lsquo;Yea, kinsman, so it is that I was seeking the Bride my
kinswoman.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Iron-face, &lsquo;call her not
kinswoman: therein is ill-luck, lest it seem that thou art to wed
one too nigh thine own blood.&nbsp; Call her the Bride only: to
thee and to me the name is good.&nbsp; Well, son, desirest thou
sorely to see her?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, yea, surely,&rsquo; said Face-of-god; but his eyes
went all about the hall still, as though his mind strayed from
the place and that home of his.
Said Iron-face: &lsquo;Have patience, son, thou shalt see her
anon, and that in such guise as shall please thee.&rsquo;
Therewithal came the maidens with the ewers of wine, and they
filled all horns and beakers, and then stood by the endlong
tables on either side laughing and talking with the carles and
the older women; and the hall was a fair sight to see, for the
many candles burned bright and the fire on the hearth flared up,
and those maids were clad in fair raiment, and there was none of
them but was comely, and some were fair, and some very fair: the
walls also were hung with goodly pictured cloths, and the image
of the God of the Face looked down smiling terribly from the
gable-end above the high-seat.
Thus as they sat they heard the sound of a horn winded close
outside the hall door, and the door was smitten on.&nbsp; Then
rose Iron-face smiling merrily, and cried out:
&lsquo;Enter ye, whether ye be friends or foes: for if ye be
foemen, yet shall ye keep the holy peace of Yule, unless ye be
the foes of all kindreds and nations, and then shall we slay
you.&rsquo;
Thereat some who knew what was toward laughed; but Gold-mane,
who had been away from Burgstead some days past, marvelled and
knit his brows, and let his right hand fall on his
sword-hilt.&nbsp; For this folk, who were of merry ways, were
wont p. 71to
deal diversely with the Yule-tide customs in the manner of shows;
and he knew not that this was one of them.
Now was the Outer door thrown open, and there entered seven
men, whereof two were all-armed in bright war-gear, and two bore
slug-horns, and two bore up somewhat on a dish covered over with
a piece of rich cloth, and the seventh stood before them all
wrapped up in a dark fur mantle.
Thus they stood a moment; and when he saw their number, back
to Gold-mane&rsquo;s heart came the thought of those folk on the
Mountain: for indeed he was somewhat out of himself for doubt and
longing, else would he have deemed that all this was but a
Yule-tide play.
Now the men with the slug-horns set them to their mouths and
blew a long blast; while the first of the new-comers set hand to
the clasps of the fur cloak and let it fall to the ground, and
lo! a woman exceeding beauteous, clad in glistering raiment of
gold and fine web; her hair wreathed with bay, and in her hand a
naked sword with goodly-wrought golden hilt and polished
blue-gleaming blade.
Face-of-god started up in his sear, and stared like a man
new-wakened from a strange dream: because for one moment he
deemed verily that it was the Woman of the Mountain arrayed as he
had last seen her, and he cried aloud &lsquo;The Friend, the
Friend!&rsquo;
His father brake out into loud laughter thereat, and clapped
his son on the shoulder and said: &lsquo;Yea, yea, lad, thou
mayst well say the Friend; for this is thine old playmate whom
thou hast been looking round the hall for, arrayed this eve in
such fashion as is meet for her goodliness and her
worthiness.&nbsp; Yea, this is the Friend indeed!&rsquo;
Then waxed Face-of-god as red as blood for shame, and he sat
him down in his place again: for now he wotted what was toward,
and saw that this fair woman was the Bride.
But Stone-face from the other side looked keenly on him.
p. 72Then
blew the horns again, and the Bride stepped daintily up the hall,
and the sweet odour of her raiment went from her about the
fire-warmed dwelling, and her beauty moved all hearts with
love.&nbsp; So stood she at the high-table; and those two who
bore the burden set it down thereon and drew off the covering,
and lo! there was the Holy Boar of Yule on which men were wont to
make oath of deeds that they would do in the coming year,
according to the custom of their forefathers.&nbsp; Then the
Bride laid the goodly sword beside the dish, and then went round
the table and sat down betwixt Face-of-god and Stone-face, and
turned kindly to Gold-mane, and was glad; for now was his fair
face as its wont was to be.&nbsp; He in turn smiled upon her, for
she was fair and kind and his fellow for many a day.
Now the men-at-arms stood each side the Boar, and out from
them on each side stood the two hornsmen: then these blew up
again, whereon the Alderman stood up and cried:
&lsquo;Ye sons of the brave who have any deed that ye may be
desirous of doing, come up, come lay your hand on the sword, and
the point of the sword to the Holy Beast, and swear the oath that
lieth on your hearts.&rsquo;
Therewith he sat down, and there strode a man up the hall,
strong-built and sturdy, but short of stature; black-haired,
red-bearded, and ruddy-faced: and he stood on the da&iuml;s, and
took up the sword and laid its point on the Boar, and said:
&lsquo;I am Bristler, son of Brightling, a man of the
Shepherds.&nbsp; Here by the Holy Boar I swear to follow up the
ransackers of Penny-thumb and the slayers of Rusty.&nbsp; And I
take this feud upon me, although they be no good men, because I
am of the kin and it falleth to me, since others forbear; and
when the Court was hallowed hereon I was away out of the Dale and
the Downs.&nbsp; So help me the Warrior, and the God of the
Earth.&rsquo;
Then the Alderman nodded his head to him kindly, and reached
him out a cup of wine, and as he drank there went up a rumour of
praise from the hall; and men said that his oath was  a
name="page73">p. 73manly and
that he was like to keep it; for he was a good man-at-arms and a
stout heart.
Then came up three men of the Shepherds and two of the Dale
and swore to help Bristler in his feud, and men thought it well
sworn.
After that came a braggart, a man very gay of his raiment, and
swore with many words that if he lived the year through he would
be a captain over the men of the Plain, and would come back again
with many gifts for his friends in the Dale.&nbsp; This men
deemed foolishly sworn, for they knew the man; so they jeered at
him and laughed as he went back to his place ashamed.
Then swore three others oaths not hard to be kept, and men
laughed and were merry.
At last uprose the Alderman, and said: &lsquo;Kinsmen, and
good fellows, good days and peaceable are in the Dale as now; and
of such days little is the story, and little it availeth to swear
a deed of derring-do: yet three things I swear by this Beast; and
first to gainsay no man&rsquo;s asking if I may perform it; and
next to set right above law and mercy above custom; and lastly,
if the days change and war cometh to us or we go to meet it, I
will be no backwarder in the onset than three fathoms behind the
foremost.&nbsp; So help me the Warrior, and the God of the Face
and the Holy Earth!&rsquo;
p.
74Therewith he sat down, and all men shouted for joy of
him, and said that it was most like that he would keep his
oath.
Last of all uprose Face-of-god and took up the sword and
looked at it; and so bright was the blade that he saw in it the
image of the golden braveries which the Bride bore, and even some
broken image of her face.&nbsp; Then he handled the hilt and laid
the point on the Boar, and cried:
&lsquo;Hereby I swear to wed the fairest woman of the Earth
before the year is worn to an end; and that whether the Dalesmen
gainsay me or the men beyond the Dale.&nbsp; So help me the
Warrior, and the God of the Face and the Holy Earth!&rsquo;
Therewith he sat down; and once more men shouted for the love
of him and of the Bride, and they said he had sworn well and like
a chieftain.
But the Bride noted him that neither were his eyes nor his
voice like to their wont as he swore, for she knew him well; and
thereat was she ill at ease, for now whatever was new in him was
to her a threat of evil to come.
Stone-face also noted him, and he knew the young man better
than all others save the Bride, and he saw withal that she was
ill-pleased, and he said to himself: &lsquo;I will speak to my
fosterling to-morrow if I may find him alone.&rsquo;
So came the swearing to an end, and they fell to on their meat
and feasted on the Boar of Atonement after they had duly given
the Gods their due share, and the wine went about the hall and
men were merry till they drank the parting cup and fared to rest
in the shut-beds, and whereso else they might in the Hall and the
House, for there were many men there.
CHAPTER XII.&nbsp; STONE-FACE TELLETH CONCERNING THE
WOOD-WIGHTS.
Early on the morrow Gold-mane arose
and clad himself and went out-a-doors and over the trodden snow
on to the bridge over the Weltering Water, and there betook
himself into one of the coins of safety built over the up-stream
piles; there he leaned against the wall and turned his face to
the Thorp, and fell to pondering on his case.&nbsp; And first he
thought about his oath, and how that he had sworn to wed the
Mountain Woman, although his kindred and her kindred should
gainsay him, yea and herself also.&nbsp; Great seemed that oath
to him, yet at that moment he wished he had made it greater, and
made all the kindred, yea and the Bride herself, sure of the
meaning of the words of it: and he deemed himself a dastard that
he had not done so.&nbsp; Then he  span
class="pagenum">p. 75looked round him and beheld the
winter, and he fell into mere longing that the spring were come
and the token from the Mountain.&nbsp; Things seemed too hard for
him to deal with, and he between a mighty folk and two wayward
women; and he went nigh to wish that he had taken his
father&rsquo;s offer and gone down to the Cities; and even had he
met his bane: well were that!&nbsp; And, as young folk will, he
set to work making a picture of his deeds there, had he been
there.&nbsp; He showed himself the stricken fight in the plain,
and the press, and the struggle, and the breaking of the serried
band, and himself amidst the ring of foemen doing most valiantly,
and falling there at last, his shield o&rsquo;er-heavy with the
weight of foemen&rsquo;s spears for a man to uphold it.&nbsp;
Then the victory of his folk and the lamentation and praise over
the slain man of the Mountain Dales, and the burial of the
valiant warrior, the praising weeping folk meeting him at the
City-gate, laid stark and cold in his arms on the gold-hung
garlanded bier.
There ended his dream, and he laughed aloud and said: &lsquo;I
am a fool!&nbsp; All this were good and sweet if I should see it
myself; and forsooth that is how I am thinking of it, as if I
still alive should see myself dead and famous!&rsquo;
Then he turned a little and looked at the houses of the Thorp
lying dark about the snowy ways under the starlit heavens of the
winter morning: dark they were indeed and grey, save where here
and there the half-burned Yule-fire reddened the windows of a
hall, or where, as in one place, the candle of some early waker
shone white in a chamber window.&nbsp; There was scarce a man
astir, he deemed, and no sound reached him save the crowing of
the cocks muffled by their houses, and a faint sound of beasts in
the byres.
Thus he stood a while, his thoughts wandering now, till
presently he heard footsteps coming his way down the street and
turned toward them, and lo it was the old man Stone-face.&nbsp;
He had seen Gold-mane go out, and had risen and followed him that
he might talk with him apart.&nbsp; Gold-mane greeted him kindly,
p. 76though,
sooth to say, he was but half content to see him; since he
doubted, what was verily the case, that his foster-father would
give him many words, counselling him to refrain from going to the
wood, and this was loathsome to him; but he spake and said:
&lsquo;Meseems, father, that the eastern sky is brightening
toward dawn.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; quoth Stone-face.
&lsquo;It will be light in an hour,&rsquo; said
Face-of-god.
&lsquo;Even so,&rsquo; said Stone-face.
&lsquo;And a fair day for the morrow of Yule,&rsquo; said the
swain.
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said Stone-face, &lsquo;and what wilt thou
do with the fair day?&nbsp; Wilt thou to the wood?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Maybe, father,&rsquo; said Gold-mane; &lsquo;Hall-face
and some of the swains are talking of elks up the fells which may
be trapped in the drifts, and if they go a-hunting them, I may go
in their company.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Ah, son,&rsquo; quoth Stone-face, &lsquo;thou wilt look
to see other kind of beasts than elks.&nbsp; Things may ye fall
in with there who may not be impounded in the snow like to elks,
but can go light-foot on the top of the soft drift from one place
to another.&rsquo;
Said Gold-mane: &lsquo;Father, fear me not; I shall either
refrain me from the wood, or if I go, I shall go to hunt the
wood-deer with other hunters.&nbsp; But since thou hast come to
me, tell me more about the wood, for thy tales thereof are
fair.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said Stone-face, &lsquo;fair tales of foul
things, as oft it befalleth in the world.&nbsp; Hearken now! if
thou deemest that what thou seekest shall come readier to thine
hand because of the winter and the snow, thou errest.&nbsp; For
the wights that waylay the bodies and souls of the mighty in the
wild-wood heed such matters nothing; yea and at Yule-tide are
they most abroad, and most armed for the fray.&nbsp; Even such an
one have I seen time agone, when the snow was deep and the wind
was rough; and it was in the likeness of a woman clad in such
raiment as the Bride bore last night, and she trod the snow
light-foot in thin raiment where it would  a
name="page77">p. 77scarce bear
the skids of a deft snow-runner.&nbsp; Even so she stood before
me; the icy wind blew her raiment round about her, and drifted
the hair from her garlanded head toward me, and she as fair and
fresh as in the midsummer days.&nbsp; Up the fell she fared,
sweetest of all things to look on, and beckoned on me to follow;
on me, the Warrior, the Stout-heart; and I followed, and between
us grief was born; but I it was that fostered that child and not
she.&nbsp; Always when she would be, was she merry and lovely;
and even so is she now, for she is of those that be
long-lived.&nbsp; And I wot that thou hast seen even such an
one!&rsquo;
&lsquo;Tell me more of thy tales, foster-father,&rsquo; said
Gold-mane, &lsquo;and fear not for me!&rsquo;
&lsquo;Ah, son,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;mayst thou have no such
tales to tell to those that shall be young when thou art
old.&nbsp; Yet hearken!&nbsp; We sat in the hall together and
there was no third; and methought that the birds sang and the
flowers bloomed, and sweet was their savour, though it was
midwinter.&nbsp; A rose-wreath was on her head; grapes were on
the board, and fair unwrinkled summer apples on the day that we
feasted together.&nbsp; When was the feast? sayst thou.&nbsp;
Long ago.&nbsp; What was the hall, thou sayest, wherein ye
feasted?&nbsp; I know not if it were on the earth or under it, or
if we rode the clouds that even.&nbsp; But on the morrow what was
there but the stark wood and the drift of the snow, and the iron
wind howling through the branches, and a lonely man, a wanderer
rising from the ground.&nbsp; A wanderer through the wood and up
the fell, and up the high mountain, and up and up to the edges of
the ice-river and the green caves of the ice-hills.&nbsp; A
wanderer in spring, in summer, autumn and winter, with an empty
heart and a burning never-satisfied desire; who hath seen in the
uncouth places many an evil unmanly shape, many a foul hag and
changing ugly semblance; who hath suffered hunger and thirst and
wounding and fever, and hath seen many things, but hath never
again seen that fair woman, or that lovely feast-hall.
&lsquo;All praise and honour to the House of the Face, and the
p. 78bounteous
valiant men thereof! and the like praise and honour to the fair
women whom they wed of the valiant and goodly House of the
Steer!&rsquo;
&lsquo;Even so say I,&rsquo; quoth Gold-mane calmly;
&lsquo;but now wend we aback to the House, for it is morning
indeed, and folk will be stirring there.&rsquo;
So they turned from the bridge together; and Stone-face was
kind and fatherly, and was telling his foster-son many wise
things concerning the life of a chieftain, and the giving-out of
dooms and the gathering for battle; to all which talk Face-of-god
seemed to hearken gladly, but indeed hearkened not at all; for
verily his eyes were beholding that snowy waste, and the fair
woman upon it; even such an one as Stone-face had told of.
CHAPTER XIII.&nbsp; THEY FARE TO THE HUNTING OF THE ELK.
When they came into the Hall, the
hearth-fire had been quickened, and the sleepers on the floor had
been wakened, and all folk were astir.&nbsp; So the old man sat
down by the hearth while Gold-mane busied himself in fetching
wood and water, and in sweeping out the Hall, and other such
works of the early morning.&nbsp; In a little while Hall-face and
the other young men and warriors were afoot duly clad, and the
Alderman came from his chamber and greeted all men kindly.&nbsp;
Soon meat was set upon the boards, and men broke their fast; and
day dawned while they were about it, and ere it was all done the
sun rose clear and golden, so that all men knew that the day
would be fair, for the frost seemed hard and enduring.
Then the eager young men and the hunters, and those who knew
the mountain best drew together about the hearth, and fell to
talking of the hunting of the elk; and there were three there who
knew both the woods and also the fells right up to the ice-rivers
p. 79better
than any other; and these said that they who were fain of the
hunting of the elk would have no likelier time than that day for
a year to come.&nbsp; Short was the rede betwixt them, for they
said they would go to the work at once and make the most of the
short winter daylight.&nbsp; So they went each to his place, and
some outside that House to their fathers&rsquo; houses to fetch
each man his gear.&nbsp; Face-of-god for his part went to his
shut-bed, and stood by his chest, and opened it, and drew out of
it a fine hauberk of ring-mail which his father had made for him:
for though Face-of-god was a deft wright, he was not by a long
way so deft as his father, who was the deftest of all men of that
time and country; so that the alien merchants would give him what
he would for his hauberks and helms, whenso he would chaffer with
them, which was but seldom.&nbsp; So Face-of-god did on this
hauberk over his kirtle, and over it he cast his foul-weather
weed, so that none might see it: he girt a strong war-sword to
his side, cast his quiver over his shoulder, and took his bow in
his hand, although he had little lust to shoot elks that day,
even as Stone-face had said; therewithal he took his skids, and
went forth of the hall to the gate of the Burg; whereto gathered
the whole company of twenty-three, and Gold-mane the
twenty-fourth.&nbsp; And each man there had his skids and his bow
and quiver, and whatso other weapon, as short-sword, or
wood-knife, or axe, seemed good to him.
So they went out-a-gates, and clomb the stairway in the cliff
which led to the ancient watch-tower: for it was on the lower
slopes of the fells which lay near to the Weltering Water that
they looked to find the elks, and this was the nighest road
thereto.&nbsp; When they had gotten to the top they lost no time,
but went their ways nearly due east, making way easily where
there were but scattered trees close to the lip of the sheer
cliffs.
They went merrily on their skids over the close-lying snow,
and were soon up on the great shoulders of the fells that went up
from the bank of the Weltering Water: at noon they came into  a
name="page80">p. 80a little dale
wherein were a few trees, and there they abided to eat their
meat, and were very merry, making for themselves tables and
benches of the drifted snow, and piling it up to windward as a
defence against the wind, which had now arisen, little but bitter
from the south-east; so that some, and they the wisest, began to
look for foul weather: wherefore they tarried the shorter while
in the said dale or hollow.
But they were scarcely on their way again before the aforesaid
south-east wind began to grow bigger, and at last blew a gale,
and brought up with it a drift of fine snow, through which they
yet made their way, but slowly, till the drift grew so thick that
they could not see each other five paces apart.
Then perforce they made stay, and gathered together under a
bent which by good luck they happened upon, where they were
sheltered from the worst of the drift.&nbsp; There they abode,
till in less than an hour&rsquo;s space the drift abated and the
wind fell, and in a little while after it was quite clear, with
the sun shining brightly and the young waxing moon white and high
up in the heavens; and the frost was harder than ever.
This seemed good to them; but now that they could see each
other&rsquo;s faces they fell to telling over their company, and
there was none missing save Face-of-god.&nbsp; They were somewhat
dismayed thereat, but knew not what to do, and they deemed he
might not be far off, either a little behind or a little ahead;
and Hall-face said:
&lsquo;There is no need to make this to-do about my brother;
he can take good care of himself; neither does a warrior of the
Face die because of a little cold and frost and snow-drift.&nbsp;
Withal Gold-mane is a wilful man, and of late days hath been
wilful beyond his wont; let us now find the elks.&rsquo;
So they went on their ways hoping to fall in with him
again.&nbsp; No long story need be made of their hunting, for not
very far from where they had taken shelter they came upon the
elks, many of them, impounded in the drifts, pretty much where
the deft p.
81hunters looked to find them.&nbsp; There then was battle
between the elks and the men, till the beasts were all slain and
only one man hurt: then they made them sleighs from wood which
they found in the hollows thereby, and they laid the carcasses
thereon, and so turned their faces homeward, dragging their prey
with them.&nbsp; But they met not Face-of-god either there or on
the way home; and Hall-face said: &lsquo;Maybe Gold-mane will lie
on the fell to-night; and I would I were with him; for adventures
oft befall such folk when they abide in the wilds.&rsquo;
Now it was late at night by then they reached Burgstead, so
laden as they were with the dead beasts; but they heeded the
night little, for the moon was well-nigh as bright as day for
them.&nbsp; But when they came to the gate of the Thorp, there
were assembled the goodmen and swains to meet them with torches
and wine in their honour.&nbsp; There also was Gold-mane come
back before them, yea for these two hours; and he stood clad in
his holiday raiment and smiled on them.
Then was there some jeering at him that he was come back
empty-handed from the hunting, and that he was not able to abide
the wind and the drift; but he laughed thereat, for all this was
but game and play, since men knew him for a keen hunter and a
stout woodsman; and they had deemed it a heavy loss of him if he
had been cast away, as some feared he had been: and his brother
Hall-face embraced him and kissed him, and said to him:
&lsquo;Now the next time that thou farest to the wood will I be
with thee foot to foot, and never leave thee, and then meseemeth
I shall wot of the tale that hath befallen thee, and belike it
shall be no sorry one.&rsquo;
Face-of-god laughed and answered but little, and they all
betook them to the House of the Face and held high feast therein,
for as late as the night was, in honour of this Hunting of the
Elk.
No man cared to question Face-of-god closely as to how or
where he had strayed from the hunt; for he had told his own tale
at once as soon as he came home, to wit, that his right-foot
skid-strap had broken, and even while he stopped to mend it came
on p. 82that
drift and weather; and that he could not move from that place
without losing his way, and that when it had cleared he knew not
whither they had gone because the snow had covered their
slot.&nbsp; So he deemed it not unlike that they had gone back,
and that he might come up with one or two on the way, and that in
any case he wotted well that they could look after themselves; so
he turned back, not going very swiftly.&nbsp; All this seemed
like enough, and a little matter except to jest about, so no man
made any question concerning it: only old Stone-face said to
himself:
&lsquo;Now were I fain to have a true tale out of him, but it
is little likely that anything shall come of my much questioning;
and it is ill forcing a young man to tell lies.&rsquo;
So he held his peace, and the feast went on merrily and
blithely.
CHAPTER XIV.&nbsp; CONCERNING FACE-OF-GOD AND THE
MOUNTAIN.
But it must be told of Gold-mane
that what had befallen him was in this wise.&nbsp; His skid-strap
brake in good sooth, and he stayed to mend it; but when he had
done what was needful, he looked up and saw no man nigh, what for
the drift, and that they had gone on somewhat; so he rose to his
feet, and without more delay, instead of keeping on toward the
elk-ground and the way his face had been set, he turned himself
north-and-by-east, and went his ways swiftly towards that
a&iacute;rt, because he deemed that it might lead him to the
Mountain-hall where he had guested.&nbsp; He abode not for the
storm to clear, but swept off through the thick of it; and indeed
the wind was somewhat at his back, so that he went the
swiftlier.&nbsp; But when the drift was gotten to its very worst,
he sheltered himself for a little in a hollow behind a thorn-bush
he stumbled upon.&nbsp; As soon as it began to abate he went on
again, and at last when it was quite clear, and the sun shone
out, he found himself on a long slope of the fells  a
name="page83">p. 83covered deep
with smooth white snow, and at the higher end a great crag rising
bare fifty feet above the snow, and more rocks, but none so
great, and broken ground as he judged (the snow being deep) about
it on the hither side; and on the further, three great pine-trees
all bent down and mingled together by their load of snow.
Thitherward he made, as a man might, seeing nothing else to
note before him; but he had not made many strides when forth from
behind the crag by the pine-trees came a man; and at first
Face-of-god thought it might be one of his hunting-fellows gone
astray, and he hailed him in a loud voice, but as he looked he
saw the sun flash back from a bright helm on the
new-comer&rsquo;s head; albeit he kept on his way till there was
but a space of two hundred yards between them; when lo! the
helm-bearer notched a shaft to his bent bow and loosed at
Face-of-god, and the arrow came whistling and passed six inches
by his right ear.&nbsp; Then Face-of-god stopped perplexed with
his case; for he was on the deep snow in his skids, with his bow
unbent, and he knew not how to bend it speedily.&nbsp; He was
loth to turn his back and flee, and indeed he scarce deemed that
it would help him.&nbsp; Meanwhile of his tarrying the archer
loosed again at him, and this time the shaft flew close to his
left ear.&nbsp; Then Face-of-god thought to cast himself down
into the snow, but he was ashamed; till there came a third shaft
which flew over his head amidmost and close to it.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Good shooting on the Mountain!&rsquo; muttered he;
&lsquo;the next shaft will be amidst my breast, and who knows
whether the Alderman&rsquo;s handiwork will keep it
out.&rsquo;
So he cried aloud: &lsquo;Thou shootest well, brother; but art
thou a foe?&nbsp; If thou art, I have a sword by my side, and so
hast thou; come hither to me, and let us fight it out friendly if
we must needs fight.&rsquo;
A laugh came down the wind to him clear but somewhat shrill,
and the archer came swiftly towards him on his skids with no
weapon in his hand save his bow; so that Face-of-god did not draw
his sword, but stood wondering.
p. 84As they
drew nearer he beheld the face of the new-comer, and deemed that
he had seen it before; and soon, for all that it was hooded close
by the ill-weather raiment, he perceived it to be the face of
Bow-may, ruddy and smiling.
She laughed out loud again, as she stopped herself within
three feet of him, and said:
&lsquo;Yea, friend Yellow-hair, we heard of the elks and
looked to see thee hereabouts, and I knew thee at once when I
came out from behind the crag and saw thee stand
bewildered.&rsquo;
Said Gold-mane: &lsquo;Hail to thee, Bow-may! and glad am I to
see thee.&nbsp; But thou liest in saying that thou knewest me;
else why didst thou shoot those three shafts at me?&nbsp; Surely
thou art not so quick as that with all thy friends: these be
sharp greetings of you Mountain-folk.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Thou lad with the sweet mouth,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;I like to see thee and hear thee talk, but now must I
hasten thy departure; so stand we here no longer.&nbsp; Let us
get down into the wood where we can do off our skids and sit
down, and then will I tell thee the tidings.&nbsp; Come
on!&rsquo;
And she caught his hand in hers, and they went speedily down
the slopes toward the great oak-wood, the wind whistling past
their ears.
&lsquo;Whither are we going?&rsquo; said he.
Said she: &lsquo;I am to show thee the way back home, which
thou wilt not know surely amidst this snow.&nbsp; Come, no words!
thou shalt not have my tale from me till we are in the wood: so
the sooner we are there the sooner shalt thou be
pleased.&rsquo;
So Face-of-god held his peace, and they went on swiftly side
by side.&nbsp; But it was not Bow-may&rsquo;s wont to be silent
for long, so presently she said:
&lsquo;Thou art good so do as I bid thee; but see thou, sweet
playmate, for all thou art a chieftain&rsquo;s son, thou wert but
feather-brained to ask me why I shot at thee.&nbsp; I shoot at
thee! that were a fine tale to tell her this even!&nbsp; Or dost
thou think that I could  span
class="pagenum">p. 85shoot at a big man on the snow at two
hundred paces and miss him three times?&nbsp; Unless I aimed to
miss.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, Bow-may,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;art thou so deft a
Bow-may?&nbsp; Thou shalt be in my company whenso I fare to
battle.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;therein thou sayest but
the bare truth: nowhere else shall I be, and thou shalt find my
bow no worse than a good shield.&rsquo;
He laughed somewhat lightly; but she looked on him soberly and
said: &lsquo;Laugh in that fashion on the day of battle, and we
shall be well content with thee!&rsquo;
So on they sped very swiftly, for their way was mostly down
hill, so that they were soon amongst the outskirting trees of the
wood, and presently after reached the edge of the thicket, beyond
which the ground was but thinly covered with snow.
There they took off their skids, and went into the thick wood
and sat down under a hornbeam tree; and ere Gold-mane could open
his mouth to speak Bow-may began and said:
&lsquo;Well it was that I fell in with thee, Dalesman, else
had there been murders of men to tell of; but ever she ordereth
all things wisely, though unwisely hast thou done to seek to
her.&nbsp; Hearken! dost thou think that thou hast done well that
thou hast me here with my tale?&nbsp; Well, hadst thou busied
thyself with the slaying of elks, or with sitting quietly at
home, yet shouldest thou have heard my tale, and thou shouldest
have seen me in Burgstead in a day or two to tell thee concerning
the flitting of the token.&nbsp; And ill it is that I have missed
it, for fain had I been to behold the House of the Face, and to
have seen thee sitting there in thy dignity amidst the kindred of
chieftains.&rsquo;
And she sighed therewith.&nbsp; But he said: &lsquo;Hold up
thine heart, Bow-may!&nbsp; On the word of a true man that shall
befall thee one day.&nbsp; But come, playmate, give me thy
tale!&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I must now tell thee in
the wild-wood what else I had told thee in the Hall.&nbsp;
Hearken closely, for this is the message:
p.
86&lsquo;Seek not to me again till thou hast the
token; else assuredly wilt thou be slain, and I
shall be sorry for many a day.&nbsp; Thereof as now I may
not tell thee more.&nbsp; Now as to the token: When
March is worn two weeks fail not to go to and fro on the place of
the Maiden Ward for an hour before sunrise every day till thou
hear tidings.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; quoth Bow-may, &lsquo;hast thou hearkened
and understood?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said he.
She said: &lsquo;Then tell me the words of my message
concerning the token.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he did so word for
word.&nbsp; Then she said:
&lsquo;It is well, there is no more to say.&nbsp; Now must I
lead thee till thou knowest the wood; and then mayst thou get on
to the smooth snow again, and so home merrily.&nbsp; Yet, thou
grey-eyed fellow, I will have my pay of thee before I do that
last work.&rsquo;
Therewith she turned about to him and took his head between
her hands, and kissed him well favouredly both cheeks and mouth;
and she laughed, albeit the tears stood in her eyes as she said:
&lsquo;Now smelleth the wood sweeter, and summer will come back
again.&nbsp; And even thus will I do once more when we stand side
by side in battle array.&rsquo;
He smiled kindly on her and nodded as they both rose up from
the earth: she had taken off her foul-weather gloves while they
spake, and he kissed her hand, which was shapely of fashion
albeit somewhat brown, and hard of palm, and he said in friendly
wise:
&lsquo;Thou art a merry faring-fellow, Bow-may, and belike
shalt be withal a true fighting-fellow.&nbsp; Come now, thou
shalt be my sister and I thy brother, in despite of those three
shafts across the snow.&rsquo;
He laughed therewith; she laughed not, but seemed glad, and
said soberly:
&lsquo;Yea, I may well be thy sister; for belike I also am of
the people of the Gods, who have come into these Dales by many
far ways.&nbsp; I am of the House of the Ragged Sword of the
Kindred of the Wolf.&nbsp; Come, brother, let us toward
Wildlake&rsquo;s Way.&rsquo;
Therewith she went before him and led through the thicket  a
name="page87">p. 87as by an
assured and wonted path, and he followed hard at heel; but his
thought went from her for a while; for those words of brother and
sister that he had spoken called to his mind the Bride, and their
kindness of little children, and the days when they seemed to
have nought to do but to make the sun brighter, and the flowers
fairer, and the grass greener, and the birds happier each for the
other; and a hard and evil thing it seemed to him that now he
should be making all these things nought and dreary to her, now
when he had become a man and deeds lay before him.&nbsp; Yet
again was he solaced by what Bow-may had said concerning battle
to come; for he deemed that she must have had this from the
Friend&rsquo;s foreseeing; and he longed sore for deeds to do,
wherein all these things might be cleared up and washen clean as
it were.
So passed they through the wood a long way, and it was getting
dark therein, and Gold-mane said:
&lsquo;Hold now, Bow-may, for I am at home here.&rsquo;
She looked around and said: &lsquo;Yea, so it is: I was
thinking of many things.&nbsp; Farewell and live merrily till
March comes and the token!&rsquo;
Therewith she turned and went her ways and was soon out of
sight, and he went lightly through the wood, and then on skids
over the hard snow along the Dale&rsquo;s edge till he was come
to the watch-tower, when the moon was bright in heaven.
Thus was he at Burgstead and the House of the Face betimes,
and before the hunters were gotten back.
CHAPTER XV.&nbsp; MURDER AMONGST THE FOLK OF THE
WOODLANDERS.
So wore away midwinter
tidingless.&nbsp; Stone-face spake no more to Face-of-god about
the wood and its wights, when he saw that the young man had come
back hale and merry, seemed not to crave over-much to go back
thither.&nbsp; As for  span
class="pagenum">p. 88the Bride, she was sad, and more than
misdoubted all; but dauntless as she was in matters that try
men&rsquo;s hardihood, she yet lacked heart to ask of Face-of-god
what had befallen him since the autumn-tide, or where he was with
her.&nbsp; So she put a force upon herself not to look sad or
craving when she was in his company, as full oft she was; for he
rather sought her than shunned her.&nbsp; For when he saw her
thus, he deemed things were changing with her as they had changed
with him, and he bethought him of what he had spoken to Bow-may,
and deemed that even so he might speak with the Bride when the
time came, and that she would not be grieved beyond measure, and
all would be well.
Now came on the thaw, and the snow went, and the grass grew
all up and down the Dale, and all waters were big.&nbsp; And
about this time arose rumours of strange men in the wood,
uncouth, vile, and murderous, and many of the feebler sort were
made timorous thereby.
But a little before March was born came new tidings from the
Woodlanders; to wit: There came on a time to the house of a
woodland carle, a worthy goodman well renowned of all, two
wayfarers in the first watch of the night; and these men said
that they were wending down to the Plain from a far-away dale,
Rose-dale to wit, which all men had heard of, and that they had
strayed from the way and were exceeding weary, and they craved a
meal&rsquo;s meat and lodging for the night.
This the goodman might nowise gainsay, and he saw no harm in
it, wherefore he bade them abide and be merry.
These men, said they who told the tidings, were outlanders,
and no man had seen any like them before: they were armed, and
bore short bows made of horn, and round targets, and
coats-of-fence done over with horn scales; they had crooked
swords girt to their sides, and axes of steel forged all in one
piece, right good weapons.&nbsp; They were clad in scarlet and
had much silver on their raiment and about their weapons, and
great rings of the same on their arms; and all this silver seemed
brand-new.
p. 89Now the
Woodland Carle gave them of such things as he had, and was kind
and blithe to them: there were in his house besides himself five
men of his sons and kindred, and his wife and three daughters and
two other maids.&nbsp; So they feasted after the
Woodlanders&rsquo; fashion, and went to bed a little before
midnight.&nbsp; Two hours after, the carle awoke and heard a
little stir, and he looked and saw the guests on their feet
amidst the hall clad in all their war-gear; and they had betwixt
them his two youngest daughters, maids of fifteen and twelve
winters, and had bound their hands and done clouts over their
mouths, so that they might not cry out; and they were just at
point to carry them off.&nbsp; Thereat the goodman, naked as he
was, caught up his sword and made at these murder-carles, and or
ever they were ware of him he had hewn down one and turned to
face the other, who smote at him with his steel axe and gave him
a great wound on the shoulder, and therewithal fled out at the
open door and forth into the wood.
The Woodlander made no stay to raise the cry (there was no
need, for the hall was astir now from end to end, and men getting
to their weapons), but ran out after the felon even as he was;
and, in spite of his grievous hurt, overran him no long way from
the house before he had gotten into the thicket.&nbsp; But the
man was nimble and strong, and the goodman unsteady from his
wound, and by then the others of the household came up with the
hue and cry he had gotten two more sore wounds and was just
making an end of throttling the felon with his bare hands.&nbsp;
So he fell into their arms fainting from weakness, and for all
they could do he died in two hours&rsquo; time from that
axe-wound in his shoulder, and another on the side of the head,
and a knife-thrust in his side; and he was a man of sixty
winters.
But the stranger he had slain outright; and the one whom he
had smitten in the hall died before the dawn, thrusting all help
aside, and making no sound of speech.
When these tidings came to Burgstead they seemed great to men,
and to Gold-mane more than all.&nbsp; So he and many others  a
name="page90">p. 90took their
weapons and fared up to Wildlake&rsquo;s Way, and so came to the
Woodland Carles.&nbsp; But the Woodlanders had borne out the
carcasses of those felons and laid them on the green before
Wood-grey&rsquo;s door (for that was the name of the dead
goodman), and they were saying that they would not bury such
accursed folk, but would bear them a little way so that they
should not be vexed with the stink of them, and cast them into
the thicket for the wolf and the wild-cat and the stoat to deal
with; and they should lie there, weapons and silver and all; and
they deemed it base to strip such wretches, for who would wear
their raiment or bear their weapons after them.
There was a great ring of folk round about them when they of
Burgstead drew near, and they shouted for joy to see their
neighbours, and made way before them.&nbsp; Then the Dalesmen
cursed these murderers who had slain so good a man, and they all
praised his manliness, whereas he ran out into the night naked
and wounded after his foe, and had fallen like his folk of old
time.
It was a bright spring afternoon in that clearing of the Wood,
and they looked at the two dead men closely; and Gold-mane, who
had been somewhat silent and moody till then, became merry and
wordy; for he beheld the men and saw that they were utterly
strange to him: they were short of stature, crooked-legged,
long-armed, very strong for their size: with small blue eyes,
snubbed-nosed, wide-mouthed, thin-lipped, very swarthy of skin,
exceeding foul of favour.&nbsp; He and all others wondered who
they were, and whence they came, for never had they seen their
like; and the Woodlanders, who often guested outlanders strayed
from the way of divers kindreds and nations, said also that none
such had they ever seen.&nbsp; But Stone-face, who stood by
Gold-mane, shook his head and quoth he:
&lsquo;The Wild-wood holdeth many marvels, and these be of
them: the spawn of evil wights quickeneth therein, and at other
whiles it melteth away again like the snow; so may it be with
these carcasses.&rsquo;
p. 91And
some of the older folk of the Woodlanders who stood by hearkened
what he said, and deemed his words wise, for they remembered
their ancient lore and many a tale of old time.
Thereafter they of Burgstead went into Wood-grey&rsquo;s hall,
or as many of them as might, for it was but a poor place and not
right great.&nbsp; There they saw the goodman laid on the
da&iuml;s in all his war-gear, under the last tie-beam of his
hall, whereon was carved amidst much goodly work of knots and
flowers and twining stems the image of the Wolf of the Waste, his
jaws open and gaping: the wife and daughters of the goodman and
other women of the folk stood about the bier singing some old
song in a low voice, and some sobbing therewithal, for the man
was much beloved: and much people of the Woodlanders was in the
hall, and it was somewhat dusk within.
So the Burgstead men greeted that folk kindly and humbly, and
again they fell to praising the dead man, saying how his deed
should long be remembered in the Dale and wide about; and they
called him a fearless man and of great worth.&nbsp; And the women
hearkened, and ceased their crooning and their sobbing, and stood
up proudly and raised their heads with gleaming eyes; and as the
words of the Burgstead men ended, they lifted up their voices and
sang loudly and clearly, standing together in a row, ten of them,
on the da&iuml;s of that poor hall, facing the gable and the
wolf-adorned tie-beam, heeding nought as they sang what was about
or behind them.
And this is some of what they sang:
Why sit ye bare in the spinning-room?
Why weave ye naked at the loom?
Bare and white as the moon we be,
That the Earth and the drifting night may see.
Now what is the worst of all your work?
What curse amidst the web shall lurk?
p.
92The worst of the work our hands shall win
Is wrack and ruin round the kin.
Shall the woollen yarn and the flaxen thread br
/>
Be gear for living men or dead?
The woollen yarn and the flaxen thread
Shall flare &rsquo;twixt living men and dead.
O what is the ending of your day?
When shall ye rise and wend away?
Our day shall end to-morrow morn,
When we hear the voice of the battle-horn.
Where first shall eyes of men behold
This weaving of the moonlight cold?
There where the alien host abides
The gathering on the Mountain-sides.
How long aloft shall the fair web fly
When the bows are bent and the spears draw nigh?
From eve to morn and morn till eve
Aloft shall fly the work we weave.
What then is this, the web ye win?
What wood-beast waxeth stark therein?
We weave the Wolf and the gift of war
From the men that were to the men that are.
So sang they: and much were all men moved at their singing,
and there was none but called to mind the old days of the
Fathers, and the years when their banner went wide in the
world.
But the Woodlanders feasted them of Burgstead what they might,
and then went the Dalesmen back to their houses; but on  a
name="page93">p. 93the
morrow&rsquo;s morrow they fared thither again, and Wood-grey was
laid in mound amidst a great assemblage of the Folk.
Many men said that there was no doubt that those two felons
were of the company of those who had ransacked the steads of
Penny-thumb and Harts-bane; and so at first deemed Bristler the
son of Brightling: but after a while, when he had had time to
think of it, he changed his mind; for he said that such men as
these would have slain first and ransacked afterwards: and some
who loved neither Penny-thumb nor Harts-bane said that they would
not have been at the pains to choose for ransacking the two worst
men about the Dale, whose loss was no loss to any but
themselves.
As for Gold-mane he knew not what to think, except that his
friends of the Mountain had had nought to do with it.
So wore the days awhile.
CHAPTER XVI.&nbsp; THE BRIDE SPEAKETH WITH FACE-OF-GOD.
February had died into March, and
March was now twelve days old, on a fair and sunny day an hour
before noon; and Face-of-god was in a meadow a scant mile down
the Dale from Burgstead.&nbsp; He had been driving a bull into a
goodman&rsquo;s byre nearby, and had had to spend toil and
patience both in getting him out of the fields and into the byre;
for the beast was hot with the spring days and the new
grass.&nbsp; So now he was resting himself in happy mood in an
exceeding pleasant place, a little meadow to wit, on one side
whereof was a great orchard or grove of sweet chestnuts, which
went right up to the feet of the Southern Cliffs: across the
meadow ran a clear brook towards the Weltering Water, free from
big stones, in some places dammed up for the flooding of the deep
pasture-meadow, and with the grass growing on its lips down to
the very water.&nbsp; There  span
class="pagenum">p. 94was a low bank just outside the
chestnut trees, as if someone had raised a dyke about them when
they were young, which had been trodden low and spreading through
the lapse of years by the faring of many men and beasts.&nbsp;
The primroses bloomed thick upon it now, and here and there along
it was a low blackthorn bush in full blossom; from the mid-meadow
and right down to the lip of the brook was the grass well nigh
hidden by the blossoms of the meadow-saffron, with daffodils
sprinkled about amongst them, and in the trees and bushes the
birds, and chiefly the blackbirds, were singing their
loudest.
There sat Face-of-god on the bank resting after his toil, and
happy was his mood; since in two days&rsquo; wearing he should be
pacing the Maiden Ward awaiting the token that was to lead him to
Shadowy Vale; so he sat calling to mind the Friend as he had last
seen her, and striving as it were to set her image standing on
the flowery grass before him, till all the beauty of the meadow
seemed bare and empty to him without her.&nbsp; Then it fell into
his mind that this had been a beloved trysting-place betwixt him
and the Bride, and that often when they were little would they
come to gather chestnuts in the grove, and thereafter sit and
prattle on the old dyke; or in spring when the season was warm
would they go barefoot into the brook, seeking its treasures of
troutlets and flowers and clean-washed agate pebbles.&nbsp; Yea,
and time not long ago had they met here to talk as lovers, and
sat on that very bank in all the kindness of good days without a
blemish, and both he and she had loved the place well for its
wealth of blossoms and deep grass and goodly trees and clear
running stream.
As he thought of all this, and how often there he had praised
to himself her beauty, which he scarce dared praise to her, he
frowned and slowly rose to his feet, and turned toward the
chestnut-grove, as though he would go thence that way; but or
ever he stepped down from the dyke he turned about again, and
even therewith, like the very image and ghost of his thought, lo!
the p. 95Bride
herself coming up from out the brook and wending toward him, her
wet naked feet gleaming in the sun as they trod down the tender
meadow-saffron and brushed past the tufts of daffodils.&nbsp; He
stood staring at her discomforted, for on that day he had much to
think of that seemed happy to him, and he deemed that she would
now question him, and his mind pondered divers ways of answering
her, and none seemed good to him.&nbsp; She drew near and let her
skirts fall over her feet, and came to him, her gown hem dragging
over the flowers: then she stood straight up before him and
greeted him, but reached not forth her hand to him nor touched
him.&nbsp; Her face was paler that its wont, and her voice
trembled as she spake to him and said:
&lsquo;Face-of-god, I would ask thee a gift.&rsquo;
&lsquo;All gifts,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that thou mayest ask,
and I may give, lie open to thee.&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;If I be alive when the time comes this gift
thou mayst well give me.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Sweet kinswoman,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;tell me what it
is that thou wouldest have of me.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he was
ill-at-ease as he waited for her answer.
She said: &lsquo;Ah, kinsman, kinsman!&nbsp; Woe on the day
that maketh kinship accursed to me because thou desirest
it!&rsquo;
He held his peace and was exceeding sorry; and she said:
&lsquo;This is the gift that I ask of thee, that in the days
to come when thou art wedded, thou wilt give me the second
man-child whom thou begettest.&rsquo;
He said: &lsquo;This shalt thou have, and would that I might
give thee much more.&nbsp; Would that we were little children
together other again, as when we played here in other
days.&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;I would have a token of thee that thou shalt
show to the God, and swear on it to give me the gift.&nbsp; For
the times change.&rsquo;
&lsquo;What token wilt thou have?&rsquo; said he.
She said: &lsquo;When next thou farest to the Wood, thou shalt
bring me back, it maybe a flower from the bank ye sit upon, or  a
name="page96">p. 96a splinter
from the da&iuml;s of the hall wherein ye feast, or maybe a ring
or some matter that the strangers are wont to wear.&nbsp; That
shall be the token.&rsquo;
She spoke slowly, hanging her head adown, but she lifted it
presently and looked into his face and said:
&lsquo;Woe&rsquo;s me, woe&rsquo;s me, Gold-mane!&nbsp; How
evil is this day, when bewailing me I may not bewail thee
also!&nbsp; For I know that thine heart is glad.&nbsp; All
through the winter have I kept this hidden in my heart, and durst
not speak to thee.&nbsp; But now the spring-tide hath driven me
to it.&nbsp; Let summer come, and who shall say?&rsquo;
Great was his grief, and his shame kept him silent, and he had
no word to say; and again she said:
&lsquo;Tell me, Gold-mane, when goest thou thither?&rsquo;
He said: &lsquo;I know not surely, may happen in two days, may
happen in ten.&nbsp; Why askest thou?&rsquo;
&lsquo;O friend!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;is it a new thing
that I should ask thee whither thou goest and whence thou comest,
and the times of thy coming and going.&nbsp; Farewell
to-day!&nbsp; Forget not the token.&nbsp; Woe&rsquo;s me, that I
may not kiss thy fair face!&rsquo;
She spread her arms abroad and lifted up her face as one who
waileth, but no sound came from her lips; then she turned about
and went away as she had come.
But as for him he stood there after she was gone in all
confusion, as if he were undone: for he felt his manhood lessened
that he should thus and so sorely have hurt a friend, and in a
manner against his will.&nbsp; And yet he was somewhat wroth with
her, that she had come upon him so suddenly, and spoken to him
with such mastery, and in so few words, and he with none to make
answer to her, and that she had so marred his pleasure and his
hope of that fair day.&nbsp; Then he sat him down again on the
flowery bank, and little by little his heart softened, and he
once more called to mind many a time when they had been there
before, and the plays and the games they had had together there
when they were little.&nbsp; And he bethought him of the days
that were long to him then,  span
class="pagenum">p. 97and now seemed short to him, and as
if they were all grown together into one story, and that a sweet
one.&nbsp; Then his breast heaved with a sob, and the tears rose
to his eyes and burned and stung him, and he fell a-weeping for
that sweet tale, and wept as he had wept once before on that old
dyke when there had been some child&rsquo;s quarrel between them,
and she had gone away and left him.
Then after a while he ceased his weeping, and looked about him
lest anyone might be coming, and then he arose and went to and
fro in the chestnut-grove for a good while, and afterwards went
his ways from that meadow, saying to himself: &lsquo;Yet
remaineth to me the morrow of to-morrow, and that is the first of
the days of the watching for the token.&rsquo;
But all that day he was slow to meet the eyes of men; and in
the hall that eve he was silent and moody; for from time to time
it came over him that some of his manhood had departed from
him.
CHAPTER XVII.&nbsp; THE TOKEN COMETH FROM THE MOUNTAIN.
The next day wore away tidingless;
and the day after Face-of-god arose betimes; for it was the first
day of his watch, and he was at the Maiden Ward before the time
appointed on a very fair and bright morning, and he went to and
fro on that place, and had no tidings.&nbsp; So he came away
somewhat cast down, and said within himself: &lsquo;Is it but a
lie and a mocking when all is said?&rsquo;
On the morrow he went thither again, and the morn was wild and
stormy with drift of rain, and low clouds hurrying over the
earth, though for the sunrise they lifted a little in the east,
and the sun came up over the passes, amidst the red and angry
rack of clouds.&nbsp; This morn also gave him no tidings of the
token, and he p.
98was wroth and perturbed in spirit: but towards evening
he said:
&lsquo;It is well: ten days she gave me, so that she might be
able to send without fail on one of them; she will not fail
me.&rsquo;
So again on the morrow he was there betimes, and the morn was
windy as on the day before, but the clouds higher and of better
promise for the day.&nbsp; Face-of-god walked to and fro on the
Maiden Ward, and as he turned toward Burgstead for the tenth
time, he heard, as he deemed, a bow-string twang afar off, and
even therewith came a shaft flying heavily like a winged bird,
which smote a great standing stone on the other side of the way,
where of old some chieftain had been buried, and fell to earth at
its foot.&nbsp; He went up to it and handled it, and saw that
there was a piece of thin parchment wrapped about it, which
indeed he was eager to unwrap at once, but forebore; because he
was on the highway, and people were already astir, and even then
passed by him a goodman of the Dale with a man of his going
afield together, and they gave him the sele of the day.&nbsp; So
he went along the highway a little till he came to a place where
was a footbridge over into the meadow.&nbsp; He crossed thereby
and went swiftly till he reached a rising ground grown over with
hazel-trees; there he sat down among the rabbit-holes, the
primrose and wild-garlic blooming about him, and three blackbirds
answering one another from the edges of the coppice.&nbsp;
Straightway when he had looked and seen none coming he broke the
threads that were wound about the scroll and the arrow, and
unrolled the parchment; and there was writing thereon in black
ink of small letters, but very fair, and this is what he read
therein:
Come thou to the Mountain Hall by the path
which thou knowest of, on the morrow of the day whereon
thou readest this.&nbsp; Rise betimes and come armed,
for there are other men than we in the wood; to whom
thy death should be a gain.&nbsp; When thou art come to
the Hall, thou shalt find no man therein; but a
great hound only, tied to a bench nigh the
da&iuml;s.&nbsp; Call him by his name, Sure-foot to
wit, and give him to eat from the meat upon the board,
and give him water  span
class="pagenum">p. 99to drink.&nbsp; If the day
is then far spent, as it is like to be, abide thou
with the hound in the hall through the night, and eat of
what thou shalt find there; but see that the hound fares
not abroad till the morrow&rsquo;s morn: then lead him out
and bring him to the north-east corner of the Hall, and he
shall lift the slot for thee that leadeth to the Shadowy
Yale.&nbsp; Follow him and all good go with thee.

Now when he had read this, earth seemed fair indeed about him,
and he scarce knew whither to turn or what to do to make the most
of his joy.&nbsp; He presently went back to Burgstead and into
the House of the Face, where all men were astir now, and the day
was clearing.&nbsp; He hid the shaft under his kirtle, for he
would not that any should see it; so he went to his shut-bed and
laid it up in his chest, wherein he kept his chiefest treasures;
but the writing on the scroll he set in his bosom and so hid
it.&nbsp; He went joyfully and proudly, as one who knoweth more
tidings and better than those around him.&nbsp; But Stone-face
beheld him, and said &lsquo;Foster-son, thou art happy.&nbsp; Is
it that the spring-tide is in thy blood, and maketh thee blithe
with all things, or hast thou some new tidings?&nbsp; Nay, I
would not have an answer out of thee; but here is good rede: when
next thou goest into the wood, it were nought so ill for thee to
have a valiant old carle by thy side; one that loveth thee, and
would die for thee if need were; one who might watch when thou
wert seeking.&nbsp; Or else beware! for there are evil things
abroad in the Wood, and moreover the brethren of those two felons
who were slain at Carlstead.&rsquo;
Then Gold-mane constrained himself to answer the old carle
softly; and he thanked him kindly for his offer, and said that so
it should be before long.&nbsp; So the talk between them fell,
and Stone-face went away somewhat well-pleased.
And now was Face-of-god become wary; and he would not draw
men&rsquo;s eyes and speech on him; so he went afield with
Hall-face to deal with the lambs and the ewes, and did like other
men.&nbsp; No less wary was he in the hall that even, and neither
spake much nor little; and when his father spake to him
concerning the Bride,  span
class="pagenum">p. 100and made game of him as a somewhat
sluggish groom, he did not change countenance, but answered
lightly what came to hand.
On the morrow ere the earliest dawn he was afoot, and he clad
himself and did on his hauberk, his father&rsquo;s work, which
was fine-wrought and a stout defence, and reached down to his
knees; and over that he did on a goodly green kirtle well
embroidered: he girt his war-sword to his side, and it was the
work of his father&rsquo;s father, and a very good sword: its
name was Dale-warden.&nbsp; He did a good helm on his head, and
slung a targe at his back, and took two spears in his hand, short
but strong-shafted and well-steeled.&nbsp; Thus arrayed he left
Burgstead before the dawn, and came to Wildlake&rsquo;s Way and
betook him to the Woodland.&nbsp; He made no stop or stay on the
path, but ate his meat standing by an oak-tree close by the
half-blind track.&nbsp; When he came to the little wood-lawn,
where was the toft of the ancient house, he looked all round
about him, for he deemed that a likely place for those ugly
wood-wights to set on him; but nought befell him, though he
stooped and drank of the woodland rill warily enough.&nbsp; So he
passed on; and there were other places also where he fared
warily, because they seemed like to hold lurking felons; though
forsooth the whole wood might well serve their turn.&nbsp; But no
evil befell him, and at last, when it yet lacked an hour to
sunset, he came to the wood-lawn where Wild-wearer had made his
onset that other eve.
He went straight up to the house, his heart beating, and he
scarce believing but that he should find the Friend abiding him
there: but when he pushed the door it gave way before him at
once, and he entered and found no man therein, and the walls
stripped bare and no shield or weapon hanging on the
panels.&nbsp; But the hound he saw tied to a bench nigh the
da&iuml;s, and the bristles on the beast&rsquo;s neck arose, and
he snarled on Face-of-god, and strained on his leathern
leash.&nbsp; Then Face-of-god went up to him and called him by
his name, Sure-foot, and gave him his hand to lick, and he
brought him water, and fed him with flesh from  a
name="page101">p. 101the meat on
the board; so the beast became friendly and wagged his tail and
whined and slobbered his hand.
Then he went all about the house, and saw and heard no living
thing therein save the mice in the panels and Sure-foot.&nbsp; So
he came back to the da&iuml;s, and sat him down at the board and
ate his fill, and thought concerning his case.&nbsp; And it came
into his mind that the Woman of the Mountain had some deed for
him to do which would try his manliness and exalt his fame; and
his heart rose high and he was glad, and he saw himself sitting
beside her on the da&iuml;s of a very fair hall beloved and
honoured of all the folk, and none had aught to say against him
or owed him any grudge.&nbsp; Thus he pleased himself in thinking
of the good days to come, sitting there till the hall grew dusk
and dark and the night-wind moaned about it.
Then after a while he arose and raked together the brands on
the hearth, and made light in the hall and looked to the
door.&nbsp; And he found there were bolts and bars thereto, so he
shot the bolts and drew the bars into their places and made all
as sure as might be.&nbsp; Then he brought Sure-foot down from
the da&iuml;s, and tied him up so that he might lie down athwart
the door, and then lay down his hauberk with his naked sword
ready to his hand, and slept long while.
When he awoke it was darker than when he had lain him for the
moon had set; yet he deemed that the day was at point of
breaking.&nbsp; So he fetched water and washed the night off him,
and saw a little glimmer of the dawn.&nbsp; Then he ate somewhat
of the meat on the board, and did on his helm and his other gear,
and unbarred the door, and led Sure-foot without, and brought him
to the north-east corner of the house, and in a little while he
lifted the slot and they departed, the man and the hound, just as
broke dawn from over the mountains.
Sure-foot led right into the heart of the pine-wood, and it
was dark enough therein, with nought but a feeble glimmer for
some while, and long was the way therethrough; but in two
hours&rsquo; p.
102space was there something of a break, and they came to
the shore of a dark deep tarn on whose windless and green waters
the daylight shone fully.&nbsp; The hound skirted the water, and
led on unchecked till the trees began to grow smaller and the air
colder for all that the sun was higher; for they had been going
up and up all the way.
So at last after a six hours&rsquo; journey they came clean
out of the pine-wood, and before them lay the black wilderness of
the bare mountains, and beyond them, looking quite near now, the
great ice-peaks, the wall of the world.&nbsp; It was but an hour
short of noon by this time, and the high sun shone down on a
barren boggy moss which lay betwixt them and the rocky
waste.&nbsp; Sure-foot made no stay, but threaded the ways that
went betwixt the quagmires, and in another hour led Face-of-god
into a winding valley blinded by great rocks, and everywhere
stony and rough, with a trickle of water running amidst of
it.&nbsp; The hound fared on up the dale to where the water was
bridged by a great fallen stone, and so over it and up a steep
bent on the further side, on to a marvellously rough
mountain-neck, whiles mere black sand cumbered with scattered
rocks and stones, whiles beset with mires grown over with the
cottony mire-grass; here and there a little scanty grass growing;
otherwhere nought but dwarf willow ever dying ever growing,
mingled with moss or red-blossomed sengreen; and all blending
together into mere desolation.
Few living things they saw there; up on the neck a few sheep
were grazing the scanty grass, but there was none to tend them;
yet Face-of-god deemed the sight of them good, for there must be
men anigh who owned them.&nbsp; For the rest, the whimbrel
laughed across the mires; high up in heaven a great eagle was
hanging; once and again a grey fox leapt up before them, and the
heath-fowl whirred up from under Face-of-god&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp;
A raven who was sitting croaking on a rock in that first dale
stirred uneasily on his perch as he saw them, and when they were
passed flapped his wings and flew after them croaking still.
p. 103Now
they fared over that neck somewhat east, making but slow way
because the ground was so broken and rocky; and in another
hour&rsquo;s space Sure-foot led down-hill due east to where the
stony neck sank into another desolate miry heath still falling
toward the east, but whose further side was walled by a rampart
of crags cleft at their tops into marvellous-shapes, coal-black,
ungrassed and unmossed.&nbsp; Thitherward the hound led straight,
and Gold-mane followed wondering: as he drew near them he saw
that they were not very high, the tallest peak scant fifty feet
from the face of the heath.
They made their way through the scattered rocks at the foot of
these crags, till, just where the rock-wall seemed the closest,
the way through the stones turned into a path going through it
skew-wise; and it was now so clear a path that belike it had been
bettered by men&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; Down thereby Face-of-god
followed the hound, deeming that he was come to the gates of the
Shadowy Vale, and the path went down steeply and swiftly.&nbsp;
But when he had gone down a while, the rocks on his right hand
sank lower for a space, so that he could look over and see what
lay beneath.
There lay below him a long narrow vale quite plain at the
bottom, walled on the further side as on the hither by sheer
rocks of black stone.&nbsp; The plain was grown over with grass,
but he could see no tree therein: a deep river, dark and green,
ran through the vale, sometimes through its midmost, sometimes
lapping the further rock-wall: and he thought indeed that on many
a day in the year the sun would never shine on that valley.
Thus much he saw, and then the rocks rose again and shut it
from his sight; and at last they drew so close together over head
that he was in a way going through a cave with little daylight
coming from above, and in the end he was in a cave indeed and
mere darkness: but with the last feeble glimmer of light he
thought he saw carved on a smooth space of the living rock at his
left hand the image of a wolf.
p. 104This
cave lasted but a little way, and soon the hound and the man were
going once more between sheer black rocks, and the path grew
steeper yet and was cut into steps.&nbsp; At last there was a
sharp turn, and they stood on the top of a long stony scree, down
which Sure-foot bounded eagerly, giving tongue as he went; but
Face-of-god stood still and looked, for now the whole Dale lay
open before him.
That river ran from north to south, and at the south end the
cliffs drew so close to it that looking thence no outgate could
be seen; but at the north end there was as it were a dreary
street of rocks, the river flowing amidmost and leaving little
foothold on either side, somewhat as it was with the pass leading
from the mountains into Burgdale.
Amidmost of the Dale a little toward the north end he saw a
doom-ring of black stones, and hard by it an ancient hall builded
of the same black stone both wall and roof, and thitherward was
Sure-foot now running.&nbsp; Face-of-god looked up and down the
Dale and could see no break in the wall of sheer rock: toward the
southern end he saw a few booths and cots built roughly of stone
and thatched with turf; thereabout he saw a few folk moving
about, the most of whom seemed to be women and children; there
were some sheep and lambs near these cots, and a herd of fifty or
so of somewhat goodly mountain-kine were feeding higher up the
valley.&nbsp; He could look down into the river from where he
stood, and he saw that it ran between rocky banks going straight
down from the face of the meadow, which was rather high above the
water, so that it seemed little likely that the water should rise
over its banks, either in summer or winter; and in summer was it
like to be highest, because the vale was so near to the high
mountains and their snows.
p.
105CHAPTER XVIII.&nbsp; FACE-OF-GOD TALKETH WITH THE
FRIEND IN SHADOWY VALE.
It was now about two hours after
noon, and a broad band of sunlight lay upon the grass of the vale
below Gold-mane&rsquo;s feet; he went lightly down the scree, and
strode forward over the level grass toward the Doom-ring, his
helm and war-gear glittering bright in the sun.&nbsp; He must
needs go through the Doom-ring to come to the Hall, and as he
stepped out from behind the last of the big upright-stones, he
saw a woman standing on the threshold of the Hall-door, which was
but some score of paces from him, and knew her at once for the
Friend.
She was clad like himself in a green kirtle gaily embroidered
and fitting close to her body, and had no gown or cloak over it;
she had a golden fillet on her head beset with blue mountain
stones, and her hair hung loose behind her.
Her beauty was so exceeding, and so far beyond all memory of
her that his mind had held, that once more fear of her fell upon
Face-of-god, and he stood still with beating heart till she
should speak to him.&nbsp; But she came forward swiftly with both
her hands held out, smiling and happy-faced, and looking very
kindly on him, and she took his hands and said to him:
&lsquo;Now welcome, Gold-mane, welcome, Face-of-god! and twice
welcome art thou and threefold.&nbsp; Lo! this is the day that
thou asked for: art thou happy in it?&rsquo;
He lifted her hands to his lips and kissed them timorously,
but said nought; and therewithal Sure-foot came running forth
from the Hall, and fell to bounding round about them, barking
noisily after the manner of dogs who have met their masters
again; and still she held his hands and beheld him kindly.&nbsp;
Then she called the hound to her, and patted him on the neck and
quieted him, and then turned to Face-of-god and laughed happily
and said:
&lsquo;I do not bid thee hold thy peace; yet thou sayest
nought.&nbsp; Is well with thee?&rsquo;
p.
106&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and more than
well.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Thou seemest to me a goodly warrior,&rsquo; she said;
&lsquo;hast thou met any foemen yesterday or this
morning?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;none hindered me; thou hast
made the ways easy to me.&rsquo;
She said soberly, &lsquo;Such as I might do, I did.&nbsp; But
we may not wield everything, for our foes are many, and I feared
for thee.&nbsp; But come thou into our house, which is ours, and
far more ours than the booth before the pine-wood.&rsquo;
She took his hand again and led him toward the door, but
Face-of-god looked up, and above the lintel he saw carved on the
dark stone that image of the Wolf, even as he had seen it carved
on Wood-grey&rsquo;s tie-beam; and therewith such thoughts came
into his mind that he stopped to look, pressing the
Friend&rsquo;s hand hard as though bidding her note it.&nbsp; The
stone wherein the image was carved was darker than the other
building stones, and might be called black; the jaws of the
wood-beast were open and gaping, and had been painted with
cinnabar, but wind and weather had worn away the most of the
colour.
Spake the Friend: &lsquo;So it is: thou beholdest the token of
the God and Father of out Fathers, that telleth the tale of so
many days, that the days which now pass by us be to them but as
the drop in the sea of waters.&nbsp; Thou beholdest the sign of
our sorrow, the memory of our wrong; yet is it also the token of
our hope.&nbsp; Maybe it shall lead thee far.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Whither?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; But she answered not a
great while, and he looked at her as she stood a-gazing on the
image, and saw how the tears stole out of her eyes and ran adown
her cheeks.&nbsp; Then again came the thought to him of
Wood-grey&rsquo;s hall, and the women of the kindred standing
before the Wolf and singing of him; and though there was little
comeliness in them and she was so exceeding beauteous, he could
not but deem that they were akin to her.
But after a while she wiped the tears from her face and turned
p. 107to him
and said: &lsquo;My friend, the Wolf shall lead thee no-whither
but where I also shall be, whatsoever peril or grief may beset
the road or lurk at the ending thereof.&nbsp; Thou shalt be no
thrall, to labour while I look on.&rsquo;
His heart swelled within him as she spoke, and he was at point
to beseech her love that moment; but now her face had grown gay
and bright again, and she said while he was gathering words to
speak withal:
&lsquo;Come in, Gold-mane, come into our house; for I have
many things to say to thee.&nbsp; And moreover thou art so
hushed, and so fearsome in thy mail, that I think thou yet
deemest me to be a Wight of the Waste, such as Stone-face thy
Fosterer told thee tales of, and forewarned thee.&nbsp; So would
I eat before thee, and sign the meat with the sign of the
Earth-god&rsquo;s Hammer, to show thee that he is in error
concerning me, and that I am a very woman flesh and fell, as my
kindred were before me.&rsquo;
He laughed and was exceeding glad, and said: &lsquo;Tell me
now, kind friend, dost thou deem that Stone-face&rsquo;s tales
are mere mockery of his dreams, and that he is beguiled by empty
semblances or less?&nbsp; Or are there such Wights in the
Waste.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;the man is a true man; and
of these things are there many ancient tales which we may not
doubt.&nbsp; Yet so it is that such wights have I never yet seen,
nor aught to scare me save evil men: belike it is that I have
been over-much busied in dealing with sorrow and ruin to look
after them: or it may be that they feared me and the
wrath-breeding grief of the kindred.&rsquo;
He looked at her earnestly, and the wisdom of her heart seemed
to enter into his; but she said: &lsquo;It is of men we must
talk, and of me and thee.&nbsp; Come with me, my
friend.&rsquo;
And she stepped lightly over the threshold and drew him
in.&nbsp; The Hall was stern and grim and somewhat dusky, for its
windows were but small: it was all of stone, both walls and
roof.&nbsp; There was no timber-work therein save the benches and
chairs, a little about the doors at the lower end that led to the
buttery p.
108and out-bowers; and this seemed to have been wrought of
late years; yea, the chairs against the gable on the da&iuml;s
were of stone built into the wall, adorned with carving somewhat
sparingly, the image of the Wolf being done over the midmost of
them.&nbsp; He looked up and down the Hall, and deemed it some
seventy feet over all from end to end; and he could see in the
dimness those same goodly hangings on the wall which he had seen
in the woodland booth.
She led him up to the da&iuml;s, and stood there leaning up
against the arm of one of those stone seats silent for a while;
then she turned and looked at him, and said:
&lsquo;Yea, thou lookest a goodly warrior; yet am I glad that
thou camest hither without battle.&nbsp; Tell me,
Gold-mane,&rsquo; she said, taking one of his spears from his
hand, &lsquo;art thou deft with the spear?&rsquo;
&lsquo;I have been called so,&rsquo; said he.
She looked at him sweetly and said: &lsquo;Canst thou show me
the feat of spear-throwing in this Hall, or shall we wend outside
presently that I may see thee throw?&rsquo;
&lsquo;The Hall sufficeth,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Shall
I set this steel in the lintel of the buttery door
yonder?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, if thou canst,&rsquo; she said.
He smiled and took the spear from her, and poised it and shook
it till it quivered again, then suddenly drew back his arm and
cast, and the shaft sped whistling down the dim hall, and smote
the aforesaid door-lintel and stuck there quivering: then he
sprang down from the da&iuml;s, and ran down the hall, and put
forth his hand and pulled it forth from the wood, and was on the
da&iuml;s again in a trice, and cast again, and the second time
set the spear in the same place, and then took his other spear
from the board and cast it, and there stood the two staves in the
wood side by side; then he went soberly down the hall and drew
them both out of the wood and came back to her, while she stood
watching him, her cheek flushed, her lips a little parted.
p. 109She
said: &lsquo;Good spear-casting, forsooth! and far above what our
folk can do, who be no great throwers of the spear.&rsquo;
Gold-mane laughed: &lsquo;Sooth is that,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;or hardly were I here to teach thee
spear-throwing.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Wilt thou never be paid for that simple
onslaught?&rsquo; she said.
&lsquo;Have I been paid then?&rsquo; said he.
She reddened, for she remembered her word to him on the
mountain; and he put his hand on her shoulder and kissed her
cheek, but timorously; nor did she withstand him or shrink aback,
but said soberly:
&lsquo;Good indeed is thy spear-throwing, and meseems my
brother will love thee when he hath seen thee strike a stroke or
two in wrath.&nbsp; But, fair warrior, there be no foemen here:
so get thee to the lower end of the Hall, and in the bower beyond
shalt thou find fresh water; there wash the waste from off thee,
and do off thine helm and hauberk, and come back speedily and eat
with me; for I hunger, and so dost thou.&rsquo;
He did as she bade him, and came back presently bearing in his
hand both helm and hauberk, and he looked light-limbed and trim
and lissome, an exceeding goodly man.
CHAPTER XIX.&nbsp; THE FAIR WOMAN TELLETH FACE-OF-GOD OF HER
KINDRED.
When he came back to the da&iuml;s
he saw that there was meat upon the board, and the Friend said to
him:
&lsquo;Now art thou Gold-mane indeed: but come now, sit by me
and eat, though the Wood-woman giveth thee but a sorry banquet, O
guest; but from the Dale it is, and we be too far now from the
dwellings of men to have delicate meat on the board, though
to-night when they come back thy cheer shall be better.&nbsp; Yet
even then thou shalt have no such dainties as Stone-face hath
imagined for thee at the hands of the Wood-wight.&rsquo;
p. 110She
laughed therewith, and he no less; and in sooth the meat was but
simple, of curds and new cheese, meat of the herdsmen.&nbsp; But
Face-of-god said gaily: &lsquo;Sweet it shall be to me; good is
all that the Friend giveth.&rsquo;
Then she raised her hand and made the sign of the Hammer over
the board, and looked up at him and said:
&lsquo;Hath the Earth-god changed my face, Gold-mane, to what
I verily am?&rsquo;
He held his face close to hers and looked into it, and
him-seemed it was as pure as the waters of a mountain lake, and
as fine and well-wrought every deal of it as when his father had
wrought in his stithy many days and fashioned a small piece of
great mastery.&nbsp; He was ashamed to kiss her again, but he
said to himself, &lsquo;This is the fairest woman of the world,
whom I have sworn to wed this year.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he spake
aloud and said:
&lsquo;I see the face of the Friend, and it will not change to
me.&rsquo;
Again she reddened a little, and the happy look in her face
seemed to grow yet sweeter, and he was bewildered with longing
and delight.
But she stood up and went to an ambrye in the wall and brought
forth a horn shod and lipped with silver of ancient fashion, and
she poured wine into it and held it forth and said:
&lsquo;O guest from the Dale, I pledge thee! and when thou
hast drunk to me in turn we will talk of weighty matters.&nbsp;
For indeed I bear hopes in my hands too heavy for the daughters
of men to bear; and thou art a chieftain&rsquo;s son, and mayst
well help me to bear them; so let us talk simply and without
guile, as folk that trust one another.&rsquo;
So she drank and held out the horn to him, and he took the
horn and her hand both, and he kissed her hand and said:
&lsquo;Here in this Hall I drink to the Sons of the Wolf,
whosoever they be.&rsquo;&nbsp; Therewith he drank and he said:
&lsquo;Simply and guilelessly indeed will I talk with thee; for I
am weary of lies, and for thy sake have I told a many.&rsquo;
p.
111&lsquo;Thou shalt tell no more,&rsquo; she said;
&lsquo;and as for the health thou hast drunk, it is good, and
shall profit thee.&nbsp; Now sit we here in these ancient seats
and let us talk.&rsquo;
So they sat them down while the sun was westering in the March
afternoon, and she said:
&lsquo;Tell me first what tidings have been in the
Dale.&rsquo;
So he told her of the ransackings and of the murder at
Carlstead.
She said: &lsquo;These tidings have we heard before, and some
deal of them we know better than ye do, or can; for we were the
ransackers of Penny-thumb and Harts-bane.&nbsp; Thereof will I
say more presently.&nbsp; What other tidings hast thou to tell
of?&nbsp; What oaths were sworn upon the Boar last
Yule?&rsquo;
So he told her of the oath of Bristler the son of
Brightling.&nbsp; She smiled and said: &lsquo;He shall keep his
oath, and yet redden no blade.&rsquo;
Then he told of his father&rsquo;s oath, and she said:
&lsquo;It is good; but even so would he do and no oath
sworn.&nbsp; All men may trust Iron-face.&nbsp; And thou, my
friend, what oath didst thou swear?&rsquo;
His face grew somewhat troubled as he said: &lsquo;I swore to
wed the fairest woman in the world, though the Dalesmen gainsaid
me, and they beyond the Dale.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and there is no need to
ask thee whom thou didst mean by thy &ldquo;fairest woman,&rdquo;
for I have seen that thou deemest me fair enough.&nbsp; My
friend, maybe thy kindred will be against it, and the kindred of
the Bride; and it might be that my kindred would have gainsaid it
if things were not as they are.&nbsp; But though all men gainsay
it, yet will not I.&nbsp; It is meet and right that we twain
wed.&rsquo;
She spake very soberly and quietly, but when she had spoken
there was nothing in his heart but joy and gladness: yet shame of
her loveliness refrained him, and he cast down his eyes before
hers.&nbsp; Then she said in a kind voice:
&lsquo;I know thee, how glad thou art of this word of mine,
because p.
112thou lookest on me with eyes of love, and thinkest of
me as better than I am; though I am no ill woman and no
beguiler.&nbsp; But this is not all that I have to say to thee,
though it be much; for there are more folk in the world than thou
and I only.&nbsp; But I told thee this first, that thou mightest
trust me in all things.&nbsp; So, my friend, if thou canst,
refrain thy joy and thy longing a little, and hearken to what
concerneth thee and me, and thy people and mine.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Fair woman and sweet friend,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;thou knowest of a gladness which is hard to bear if one
must lay it aside for a while; and of a longing which is hard to
refrain if it mingle with another longing&mdash;knowest thou
not?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I know it.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yet,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;I will forbear as
thou biddest me.&nbsp; Tell me, then, what were the felons who
were slain at Carlstead?&nbsp; Knowest thou of them?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Over well,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;they are our foes
this many a year; and since we met last autumn they have become
foes of you Dalesmen also.&nbsp; Soon shall ye have tidings of
them; and it was against them that I bade thee arm
yesterday.&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;Is it against them that thou wouldst
have us do battle along with thy folk?&rsquo;
&lsquo;So it is,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;no other foemen have
we.&nbsp; And now, Gold-mane, thou art become a friend of the
Wolf, and shalt before long be of affinity with our House; that
other day thou didst ask me to tell thee of me and mine, and now
will I do according to thine asking.&nbsp; Short shall my tale
be; because maybe thou shalt hear it told again, and in goodly
wise, before thine whole folk.
&lsquo;As thou wottest we be now outlaws and Wolves&rsquo;
Heads; and whiles we lift the gear of men, but ever if we may of
ill men and not of good; there is no worthy goodman of the Dale
from whom we would take one hoof, or a skin of wine, or a cake of
wax.
&lsquo;Wherefore are we outlaws?&nbsp; Because we have been
driven p.
113from our own, and we bore away our lives and our
weapons, and little else; and for our lands, thou seest this Vale
in the howling wilderness and how narrow and poor it is, though
it hath been the nurse of warriors in time past.
&lsquo;Hearken!&nbsp; Time long ago came the kindred of the
Wolf to these Mountains of the World; and they were in a pass in
the stony maze and the utter wilderness of the Mountains, and the
foe was behind them in numbers not to be borne up against.&nbsp;
And so it befell that the pass forked, and there were two ways
before our Folk; and one part of them would take the way to the
north and the other the way to the south; and they could not
agree which way the whole Folk should take.&nbsp; So they
sundered into two companies, and one took one way and one
another.&nbsp; Now as to those who fared by the southern road, we
knew not what befell them, nor for long and long had we any tale
of them.
&lsquo;But we who took the northern road, we happened on this
Vale amidst the wilderness, and we were weary of fleeing from the
over-mastering foe; and the dale seemed enough, and a refuge, and
a place to dwell in, and no man was there before us, and few were
like to find it, and we were but a few.&nbsp; So we dwelt here in
this Vale for as wild as it is, the place where the sun shineth
never in the winter, and scant is the summer sunshine
therein.&nbsp; Here we raised a Doom-ring and builded us a Hall,
wherein thou now sittest beside me, O friend, and we dwelt here
many seasons.
&lsquo;We had a few sheep in the wilderness, and a few neat
fed down the grass of the Vale; and we found gems and copper in
the rocks about us wherewith at whiles to chaffer with the
aliens, and fish we drew from our river the Shivering
Flood.&nbsp; Also it is not to be hidden that in those days we
did not spare to lift the goods of men; yea, whiles would our
warriors fare down unto the edges of the Plain and lie in wait
there till the time served, and then drive the spoil from under
the very walls of the  span
class="pagenum">p. 114Cities.&nbsp; Our men were not
little-hearted, nor did our women lament the death of warriors
over-much, for they were there to bear more warriors to the
Folk.
&lsquo;But the seasons passed, and the Folk multiplied in
Shadowy Vale, and livelihood seemed like to fail them, and needs
must they seek wider lands.&nbsp; So by ways which thou wilt one
day wot of, we came into a valley that lieth north-west of
Shadowy Vale: a land like thine of Burgdale, or better; wide it
was, plenteous of grass and trees, well watered, full of all
things that man can desire.
&lsquo;Were there men before us in this Dale? sayest
thou.&nbsp; Yea, but not very many, and they feeble in battle,
weak of heart, though strong of body.&nbsp; These, when they saw
the Sons of the Wolf with weapons in their hands, felt themselves
puny before us, and their hearts failed them; and they came to us
with gifts, and offered to share the Dale between them and us,
for they said there was enough for both folks.&nbsp; So we took
their offer and became their friends; and some of our Houses
wedded wives of the strangers, and gave them their women to
wife.&nbsp; Therein they did amiss; for the blended Folk as the
generations passed became softer than our blood, and many were
untrusty and greedy and tyrannous, and the days of the whoredom
fell upon us, and when we deemed ourselves the mightiest then
were we the nearest to our fall.&nbsp; But the House whereof I am
would never wed with these Westlanders, and other Houses there
were who had affinity with us who chiefly wedded with us of the
Wolf, and their fathers had come with ours into that fruitful
Dale; and these were called the Red Hand, and the Silver Arm, and
the Golden Bushel, and the Ragged Sword.&nbsp; Thou hast heard
those names once before, friend?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; he said, and as he spoke the picture of
that other day came back to him, and he called to mind all that
he had said, and his happiness of that hour seemed the more and
the sweeter for that memory.
p. 115She
went on: &lsquo;Fair and goodly is that Dale as mine own eyes
have seen, and plentiful of all things, and up in its mountains
to the east are caves and pits whence silver is digged
abundantly; therefore is the Dale called Silver-dale.&nbsp; Hast
thou heard thereof, my friend?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;though I have
marvelled whence ye gat such foison of silver.&rsquo;
He looked on her and marvelled, for now she seemed as if it
were another woman: her eyes were gleaming bright, her lips were
parted; there was a bright red flush on the pommels of her two
cheeks as she spake again and said:
&lsquo;Happy lived the Folk in Silver-dale for many and many
winters and summers: the seasons were good and no lack was there:
little sickness there was and less war, and all seemed better
than well.&nbsp; It is strange that ye Dalesmen have not heard of
Silver-dale.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but I have not; of
Rose-dale have I heard, as a land very far away: but no further
do we know of toward that a&iacute;rt.&nbsp; Lieth Silver-dale
anywhere nigh to Rose-dale?&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;It is the next dale to it, yet is it a far
journey betwixt the two, for the ice-sea pusheth a horn in
betwixt them; and even below the ice the mountain-neck is
passable to none save a bold crag-climber, and to him only
bearing his life in his hands.&nbsp; But, my friend, I am but
lingering over my tale, because it grieveth me sore to have to
tell it.&nbsp; Hearken then!&nbsp; In the days when I had seen
but ten summers, and my brother was a very young man, but
exceeding strong, and as beautiful as thou art now, war fell on
us without rumour or warning; for there swarmed into Silver-dale,
though not by the ways whereby we had entered it, a host of
aliens, short of stature, crooked of limb, foul of aspect, but
fierce warriors and armed full well: they were men having no
country to go back to, though they had no women or children with
them, as we had when we were young in these lands, but used all
women whom they took as their beastly lust bade them, making them
their thralls if they  span
class="pagenum">p. 116slew them not.&nbsp; Soon we found
that these foemen asked no more of us than all we had, and
therewithal our lives to be cast away or used for their service
as beasts of burden or pleasure.&nbsp; There then we gathered our
fighting-men and withstood them; and if we had been all of the
kindreds of the Wolf and the fruit of the wives of warriors, we
should have driven back these felons and saved the Dale, though
it maybe more than half ruined: but the most part of us were of
that mingled blood, or of the generations of the Dalesmen whom we
had conquered long ago, and stout as they were of body their
hearts failed them, and they gave themselves up to the aliens to
be as their oxen and asses.
&lsquo;Why make a long tale of it?&nbsp; We who were left, and
could brook death but not thraldom, fought it out together, women
as well as men, till the sweetness of life and a happy chance for
escape bid us flee, vanquished but free men.&nbsp; For at the end
of three days&rsquo; fight we had been driven up to the
easternmost end of the Dale, and up anigh to the jaws of the pass
whereby the Folk had first come into Silver-dale, and we had
those with us who knew every cranny of that way, while to
strangers who knew it not it was utterly impassable; night was
coming on also, and even those murder-carles were weary with
slaying; and, moreover, on this last day, when they saw that they
had won all, they were fighting to keep, and not to slay, and a
few stubborn carles and queens, of what use would they be, or
where was the gain of risking life to win them?
&lsquo;So they forbore us, and night came on moonless and
dark; and it was the early spring season, when the days are not
yet long, and so by night and cloud we fled away, and back again
to Shadowy Vale.
&lsquo;Forsooth, we were but a few; for when we were gotten
into this Vale, this strip of grass and water in the wilderness,
and had told up our company, we were but two hundred and thirty
and five of men and women and children.&nbsp; For there were an
hundred and thirty and three grown men of all ages, and of women
grown seventy and five, and one score and seven children, whereof
I was one; p.
117for, as thou mayst deem, it was easier for grown men
with weapons in their hands to escape from that slaughter than
for women and children.
&lsquo;There sat we in yonder Doom-ring and took counsel, and
to some it seemed good that we should all dwell together in
Shadowy Vale, and beset the skirts of the foemen till the days
should better; but others deemed that there was little avail
therein; and there was a mighty man of the kindred, Stone-wolf by
name, a man of middle-age, and he said, that late in life had he
tasted of war, and though the banquet was made bitter with
defeat, yet did the meat seem wholesome to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come
down with me to the Cities of the Plain,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;all you who are stout warriors; and leave we here the old
men and the swains and the women and children.&nbsp; Hateful are
the folk there, and full of malice, but soft withal and
dastardly.&nbsp; Let us go down thither and make ourselves strong
amongst them, and sell our valour for their wealth till we come
to rule them, and they make us their kings, and we establish the
Folk of the Wolf amongst the aliens; then will we come back
hither and bring away that which we have left.&rdquo;
&lsquo;So he spake, and the more part of the warriors yea said
his rede, and they went with him to the Westland, and amongst
these was my brother Folk-might (for that is his name in the
kindred).&nbsp; And I sorrowed at his departure, for he had borne
me thither out of the flames and the clash of swords and the
press of battle, and to me had he ever been kind and loving,
albeit he hath had the Words of hard and froward used on him full
oft.
&lsquo;So in this Vale abode we that were left, and the
seasons passed; some of the elders died, and some of the children
also; but more children were born, for amongst us were men and
women to whom it was lawful to wed with each other.&nbsp; Even
with this scanty remnant was left some of the life of the kindred
of old days; and after we had been here but a little while, the
young men, yea and the old also, and even some of the women,
would steal through passes that we, and we only, knew of, and
would fall upon p.
118the Aliens in Silver-dale as occasion served, and lift
their goods both live and dead; and this became both a craft and
a pastime amongst us.&nbsp; Nor may I hide that we sometimes went
lifting otherwhere; for in the summer and autumn we would fare
west a little and abide in the woods the season through, and hunt
the deer thereof, and whiles would we drive the spoil from the
scattered folk not far from your Shepherd-Folk; but with the
Shepherds themselves and with you Dalesmen we meddled not.
&lsquo;Now that little wood-lawn with the toft of an ancient
dwelling in it, wherein, saith Bow-may, thou didst once rest, was
one of our summer abodes; and later on we built the hall under
the pine-wood that thou knowest.
&lsquo;Thus then grew up our young men; and our maids were
little softer; e&rsquo;en such as Bow-may is (and kind is she
withal), and it seemed in very sooth as if the Spirit of the Wolf
was with us, and the roughness of the Waste made us fierce; and
law we had not and heeded not, though love was amongst
us.&rsquo;
She stopped awhile and fell a-musing, and her face softened,
and she turned to him with that sweet happy look upon it and
said:
&lsquo;Desolate and dreary is the Dale, thou deemest, friend;
and yet for me I love it and its dark-green water, and it is to
me as if the Fathers of the kindred visit it and hold converse
with us; and there I grew up when I was little, before I knew
what a woman was, and strange communings had I with the
wilderness.&nbsp; Friend, when we are wedded, and thou art a
great chieftain, as thou wilt be, I shall ask of thee the boon to
suffer me to abide here at whiles that I may remember the days
when I was little and the love of the kindred waxed in
me.&rsquo;
&lsquo;This is but a little thing to ask,&rsquo; said
Face-of-god; &lsquo;I would thou hadst asked me more.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Fear not,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I shall ask thee for
much and many things; and some of them belike thou shalt deny
me.&rsquo;
He shook his head; but she smiled in his face and said:
&lsquo;Yea, so it is, friend; but hearken.&nbsp; The seasons
passed, and p.
119six years wore, and I was grown a tall slim maiden,
fleet of foot and able to endure toil enough, though I never bore
weapons, nor have done.&nbsp; So on a fair even of midsummer when
we were together, the most of us, round about this Hall and the
Doom-ring, we saw a tall man in bright war-gear come forth into
the Dale by the path that thou camest, and then another and
another till there were two score and seven men-at-arms standing
on the grass below the scree yonder; by that time had we gotten
some weapons in our hands, and we stood together to meet the
new-comers, but they drew no sword and notched no shaft, but came
towards us laughing and joyous, and lo! it was my brother
Folk-might and his men, those that were left of them, come back
to us from the Westland.
&lsquo;Glad indeed was I to behold him; and for him when he
had taken me in his arms and looked up and down the Dale, he
cried out: &lsquo;In many fair places and many rich dwellings
have I been; but this is the hour that I have looked
for.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Now when we asked him concerning Stone-wolf and the
others who were missing (for ten tens of stalwarth men had fared
to the Westland), he swept out his hand toward the west and said
with a solemn face: &ldquo;There they lie, and grass groweth over
their bones, and we who have come aback, and ye who have abided,
these are now the children of the Wolf: there are no more now on
the earth.&rdquo;
&lsquo;Let be!&nbsp; It was a fair even and high was the feast
in the Hall that night, and sweet was the converse with our folk
come back.&nbsp; A glad man was my brother Folk-might when he
heard that for years past we had been lifting the gear of men,
and chiefly of the Aliens in Silver-dale: and he himself was
become learned in war and a deft leader of men.
&lsquo;So the days passed and the seasons, and we lived on as
we might; but with Folk-might&rsquo;s return there began to grow
up in all our hearts what had long been flourishing in mine, and
that was the hope of one day winning back our own again, and
dying amidst the dear groves of Silver-dale.&nbsp; Within these
years we had p.
120increased somewhat in number; for if we had lost those
warriors in the Westland, and some old men who had died in the
Dale, yet our children had grown up (I have now seen twenty and
one summers) and more were growing up.&nbsp; Moreover, after the
first year, from the time when we began to fall upon the Dusky
Men of Silver-dale, from time to time they who went on such
adventures set free such thralls of our blood as they could fall
in with and whom they could trust in, and they dwelt (and yet
dwell) with us in the Dale: first and last we have taken in three
score and twelve of such men, and a score of women-thralls
withal.
&lsquo;Now during these seasons, and not very long ago, after
I was a woman grown, the thought came to me, and to Folk-might
also, that there were kindreds of the people dwelling anear us
whom we might so deal with that they should become our friends
and brothers in arms, and that through them we might win back
Silver-dale.
&lsquo;Of Rose-dale we wotted already that the Folk were
nought of our blood, feeble in the field, cowed by the Dusky Men,
and at last made thralls to them; so nought was to do
there.&nbsp; But Folk-might went to and fro to gather tidings: at
whiles I with him, at whiles one or more of Wood-father&rsquo;s
children, who with their father and mother and Bow-may have
abided in the Vale ever since the Great Undoing.
&lsquo;Soon he fell in with thy Folk, and first of all with
the Woodlanders, and that was a joy to him; for wot ye
what?&nbsp; He got to know that these men were the children of
those of our Folk who had sundered from us in the mountain passes
time long and long ago; and he loved them, for he saw that they
were hardy and trusty, and warriors at heart.
&lsquo;Then he went amongst the Shepherd-Folk, and he deemed
them good men easily stirred, and deemed that they might soon be
won to friendship; and he knew that they were mostly come from
the Houses of the Woodlanders, so that they also were of the
kindred.
&lsquo;And last he came into Burgdale, and found there a merry
p. 121and
happy Folk, little wont to war, but stout-hearted, and nowise
puny either of body or soul; he went there often and learned much
about them, and deemed that they would not be hard to win to
fellowship.&nbsp; And he found that the House of the Face was the
chiefest house there; and that the Alderman and his sons were
well beloved of all the folk, and that they were the men to be
won first, since through them should all others be won.&nbsp; I
also went to Burgstead with him twice, as I told thee erst; and I
saw thee, and I deemed that thou wouldest lightly become our
friend; and it came into my mind that I myself might wed thee,
and that the House of the Face thereby might have affinity
thenceforth with the Children of the Wolf.&rsquo;
He said: &lsquo;Why didst thou deem thus of me, O
friend?&rsquo;
She laughed and said: &lsquo;Dost thou long to hear me say the
words when thou knowest my thought well?&nbsp; So be it.&nbsp; I
saw thee both young and fair; and I knew thee to be the son of a
noble, worthy, guileless man and of a beauteous woman of great
wits and good rede.&nbsp; And I found thee to be kind and
open-handed and simple like thy father, and like thy mother wiser
than thou thyself knew of thyself; and that thou wert desirous of
deeds and fain of women.&rsquo;
She was silent for a while, and he also: then he said:
&lsquo;Didst thou draw me to the woods and to thee?&rsquo;
She reddened and said: &lsquo;I am no spell-wife: but true it
is that Wood-mother made a waxen image of thee, and thrust
through the heart thereof the pin of my girdle-buckle, and
stroked it every morning with an oak-bough over which she had
sung spells.&nbsp; But dost thou not remember, Gold-mane, how
that one day last Hay-month, as ye were resting in the meadows in
the cool of the evening, there came to you a minstrel that played
to you on the fiddle, and therewith sang a song that melted all
your hearts, and that this song told of the Wild-wood, and what
was therein of desire and peril and beguiling and death, and love
unto Death itself?&nbsp; Dost thou remember, friend?&rsquo;
p.
122&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and how when the
minstrel was done Stone-face fell to telling us more tales yet of
the woodland, and the minstrel sang again and yet again, till his
tales had entered into my very heart.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and that minstrel was
Wood-wont; and I sent him to sing to thee and thine, deeming that
if thou didst hearken, thou would&rsquo;st seek the woodland and
happen upon us.&rsquo;
He laughed and said: &lsquo;Thou didst not doubt but that if
we met, thou mightest do with me as thou wouldest?&rsquo;
&lsquo;So it is,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that I doubted it
little.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Therein wert thou wise,&rsquo; said Face-of-god;
&lsquo;but now that we are talking without guile to each other,
mightest thou tell me wherefore it was that Folk-might made that
onslaught upon me?&nbsp; For certain it is that he was minded to
slay me.&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;It was sooth what I told thee, that whiles he
groweth so battle-eager that whatso edge-tool he beareth must
needs come out of the scabbard; but there was more in it than
that, which I could not tell thee erst.&nbsp; Two days before thy
coming he had been down to Burgstead in the guise of an old carle
such as thou sawest him with me in the market-place.&nbsp; There
was he guested in your Hall, and once more saw thee and the Bride
together; and he saw the eyes of love wherewith she looked on
thee (for so much he told me), and deemed that thou didst take
her love but lightly.&nbsp; And he himself looked on her with
such love (and this he told me not) that he deemed nought good
enough for her, and would have had thee give thyself up wholly to
her; for my brother is a generous man, my friend.&nbsp; So when I
told him on the morn of that day whereon we met that we looked to
see thee that eve (for indeed I am somewhat foreseeing), he said:
&ldquo;Look thou, Sun-beam, if he cometh, it is not unlike that I
shall drive a spear through him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wherefore?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;can he serve our turn
when he is dead?&rdquo;&nbsp; Said he: &ldquo;I care
little.&nbsp; Mine own turn will I serve.&nbsp; Thou sayest
Wherefore?&nbsp; I tell thee this stripling beguileth to
her torment the fairest woman that is in the  a
name="page123">p.
123world&mdash;such an one as is meet to be the mother of
chieftains, and to stand by warriors in their day of peril.&nbsp;
I have seen her; and thus have I seen her.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then said
I: &ldquo;Greatly forsooth shalt thou pleasure her by slaying
him!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he answered: &ldquo;I shall pleasure
myself.&nbsp; And one day she shall thank me, when she taketh my
hand in hers and we go together to the Bride-bed.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Therewith came over me a clear foresight of the hours to come,
and I said to him: &ldquo;Yea, Folk-might, cast the spear and
draw the sword; but him thou shalt not slay: and thou shalt one
day see him standing with us before the shafts of the Dusky
Men.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I spake; but he looked fiercely at me, and
departed and shunned me all that day, and by good hap I was hard
at hand when thou drewest nigh our abode.&nbsp; Nay, Gold-mane,
what would&rsquo;st thou with thy sword?&nbsp; Why art thou so
red and wrathful?&nbsp; Would&rsquo;st thou fight with my brother
because he loveth thy friend, thine old playmate, thy kinswoman,
and thinketh pity of her sorrow?&rsquo;
He said, with knit brow and gleaming eyes: &lsquo;Would the
man take her away from me perforce?&rsquo;
&lsquo;My friend,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;thou art not yet so
wise as not to be a fool at whiles.&nbsp; Is it not so that she
herself hath taken herself from thee, since she hath come to know
that thou hast given thyself to another?&nbsp; Hath she noted
nought of thee this winter and spring?&nbsp; Is she well pleased
with the ways of thee?&rsquo;
He said: &lsquo;Thou hast spoken simply with me, and I will do
no less with thee.&nbsp; It was but four days agone that she did
me to wit that she knew of me how I sought my love on the
Mountain; and she put me to sore shame, and afterwards I wept for
her sorrow.&rsquo;
Therewith he told her all that the Bride had said to him, as
he well might, for he had forgotten no word of it.
Then said the Friend: &lsquo;She shall have the token that she
craveth, and it is I that shall give it to her.&rsquo;
Therewith she took from her finger a ring wherein was set a
very fair changeful mountain-stone, and gave it to him, and
said:
p.
124&lsquo;Thou shalt give her this and tell her whence
thou hadst it; and tell her that I bid her remember that
To-morrow is a new day.&rsquo;
CHAPTER XX.&nbsp; THOSE TWO TOGETHER HOLD THE RING OF THE
EARTH-GOD.
And now they fell silent both of
them, and sat hearkening the sounds of the Dale, from the whistle
of the plover down by the water-side to the far-off voices of the
children and maidens about the kine in the lower meadows.&nbsp;
At last Gold-mane took up the word and said:
&lsquo;Sweet friend, tell me the uttermost of what thou
would&rsquo;st have of me.&nbsp; Is it not that I should stand by
thee and thine in the Folk-mote of the Dalesmen, and speak for
you when ye pray us for help against your foemen; and then again
that I do my best when ye and we are arrayed for battle against
the Dusky Men?&nbsp; This is easy to do, and great is the reward
thou offerest me.&rsquo;
&lsquo;I look for this service of thee,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;and none other.&rsquo;
&lsquo;And when I go down to the battle,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;shalt thou be sorry for our sundering?&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;There shall be no sundering; I shall wend
with thee.&rsquo;
Said he: &lsquo;And if I were slain in the battle,
would&rsquo;st thou lament me?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Thou shalt not be slain,&rsquo; she said.
Again was there silence betwixt them, till at last he
said:
&lsquo;This then is why thou didst draw me to thee in the
Wild-wood?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said she.
Again for a while no word was spoken, and Face-of-god looked
on her till she cast her eyes down before him.
Then at last he spake, and the colour came and went in his
face as he said: &lsquo;Tell me thy name what it is.&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;I am called the Sun-beam.&rsquo;
Then he said, and his voice trembled therewith: &lsquo;O
Sun-beam, I have been seeking pleasant and cunning words, and can
find p.
125none such.&nbsp; But tell me this if thou wilt: dost
thou desire me as I desire thee? or is it that thou wilt suffer
me to wed thee and bed thee at last as mere payment for the help
that I shall give to thee and thine?&nbsp; Nay, doubt it not that
I will take the payment, if this is what thou wilt give me and
nought else.&nbsp; Yet tell me.&rsquo;
Her face grew troubled, and she said:
&lsquo;Gold-mane, maybe that thou hast now asked me one
question too many; for this is no fair game to be played between
us.&nbsp; For thee, as I deem, there are this day but two people
in the world, and that is thou and I, and the earth is for us two
alone.&nbsp; But, my friend, though I have seen but twenty and
one summers, it is nowise so with me, and to me there are many in
the world; and chiefly the Folk of the Wolf, amidst whose very
heart I have grown up.&nbsp; Moreover, I can think of her whom I
have supplanted, the Bride to wit; and I know her, and how bitter
and empty her days shall be for a while, and how vain all our
redes for her shall seem to her.&nbsp; Yea, I know her sorrow,
and see it and grieve for it: so canst not thou, unless thou
verily see her before thee, her face unhappy, and her voice
changed and hard.&nbsp; Well, I will tell thee what thou
askest.&nbsp; When I drew thee to me on the Mountain I thought
but of the friendship and brotherhood to be knitted up between
our two Folks, nor did I anywise desire thy love of a young
man.&nbsp; But when I saw thee on the heath and in the Hall that
day, it pleased me to think that a man so fair and chieftain-like
should one day lie by my side; and again when I saw that the love
of me had taken hold of thee, I would not have thee grieved
because of me, but would have thee happy.&nbsp; And now what
shall I say?&mdash;I know not; I cannot tell.&nbsp; Yet am I the
Friend, as erst I called myself.
&lsquo;And, Gold-mane, I have seen hitherto but the outward
show and image of thee, and though that be goodly, how would it
be if thou didst shame me with little-heartedness and evil
deeds?&nbsp; Let me see thee in the Folk-mote and the battle, and
then may I answer thee.&rsquo;
p. 126Then
she held her peace, and he answered nothing; and she turned her
face from him and said:
&lsquo;Out on it! have I beguiled myself as well as
thee?&nbsp; These are but empty words I have been saying.&nbsp;
If thou wilt drag the truth out of me, this is the very truth:
that to-day is happy to me as it is to thee, and that I have
longed sore for its coming.&nbsp; O Gold-mane, O speech-friend,
if thou wert to pray me or command me that I lie in thine arms
to-night, I should know not how to gainsay thee.&nbsp; Yet I
beseech thee to forbear, lest thy death and mine come of
it.&nbsp; And why should we die, O friend, when we are so young,
and the world lies so fair before us, and the happy days are at
hand when the Children of the Wolf and the kindreds of the Dale
shall deliver the Folk, and all days shall be good and all
years?&rsquo;
They had both risen up as she spake, and now he put forth his
hands to her and took her in his arms, wondering the while, as he
drew her to him, how much slenderer and smaller and weaker she
seemed in his embrace than he had thought of her; and when their
lips met, he felt that she kissed him as he her.&nbsp; Then he
held her by the shoulders at arms&rsquo; length from him, and
beheld her face how her eyes were closed and her lips
quivering.&nbsp; But before him, in a moment of time, passed a
picture of the life to be in the fair Dale, and all she would
give him there, and the days good and lovely from morn to eve and
eve to morn; and though in that moment it was hard for him to
speak, at last he spoke in a voice hoarse at first, and said:
&lsquo;Thou sayest sooth, O friend; we will not die, but live;
I will not drag our deaths upon us both, nor put a sword in the
hands of Folk-might, who loves me not.&rsquo;
Then he kissed her on the brow and said: &lsquo;Now shalt thou
take me by the hand and lead me forth from the Hall.&nbsp; For
the day is waxing old, and here meseemeth in this dim hall there
are words crossing in the air about us&mdash;words spoken in days
long ago, and tales of old time, that keep egging me on to do my
will p. 127and
die, because that is all that the world hath for a valiant man;
and to such words I would not hearken, for in this hour I have no
will to die, nor can I think of death.&rsquo;
She took his hand and led him forth without more words, and
they went hand in hand and paced slowly round the Doom-ring, the
light air breathing upon them till their faces were as calm and
quiet as their wont was, and hers especially as bright and happy
as when he had first seen her that day.
The sun was sinking now, and only sent one golden ray into the
valley through a cleft in the western rock-wall, but the sky
overhead was bright and clear; from the meadows came the sound of
the lowing of kine and the voices of children a-sporting, and it
seemed to Gold-mane that they were drawing nigher, both the
children and the kine, and somewhat he begrudged it that he
should not be alone with the Friend.
Now when they had made half the circuit of the Doom-ring, the
Sun-beam stopped him, and then led him through the Ring of
Stones, and brought him up to the altar which was amidst of it;
and the altar was a great black stone hewn smooth and clean, and
with the image of the Wolf carven on the front thereof; and on
its face lay the gold ring which the priest or captain of the
Folk bore on his arm between the God and the people at all
folk-motes.
So she said: &lsquo;This is the altar of the God of Earth, and
often hath it been reddened by mighty men; and thereon lieth the
Ring of the Sons of the Wolf; and now it were well that we swore
troth on that ring before my brother cometh; for now will he soon
be here.&rsquo;
Then Gold-mane took the Ring and thrust his right hand through
it, and took her right hand in his; so that the Ring lay on both
their hands, and therewith he spake aloud:
&lsquo;I am Face-of-god of the House of the Face, and I do
thee to wit, O God of the Earth, that I pledge my troth to this
woman, the Sun-beam of the Kindred of the Wolf, to beget my
offspring p.
128on her, and to live with her, and to die with her: so
help me, thou God of the Earth, and the Warrior and the God of
the Face!&rsquo;
Then spake the Sun-beam: &lsquo;I, the Sun-beam of the
Children of the Wolf, pledge my troth to Face-of-god to lie in
his bed and to bear his children and none other&rsquo;s, and to
be his speech-friend till I die: so help me the Wolf and the
Warrior and the God of the Earth!&rsquo;
Then they laid the Ring on the altar again, and they kissed
each other long and sweetly, and then turned away from the altar
and departed from the Doom-ring, going hand in hand together down
the meadow, and as they went, the noise of the kine and the
children grew nearer and nearer, and presently came the whole
company of them round a ness of the rock-wall; there were some
thirty little lads and lasses driving on the milch-kine, with
half a score of older maids and grown women, one of whom was
Bow-may, who was lightly and scantily clad, as one who heeds not
the weather, or deems all months midsummer.
The children came running up merrily when they saw the
Sun-beam, but stopped short shyly when they noted the tall fair
stranger with her.&nbsp; They were all strong and sturdy
children, and some very fair, but brown with the weather, if not
with the sun.&nbsp; Bow-may came up to Gold-mane and took his
hand and greeted him kindly and said:
&lsquo;So here thou art at last in Shadowy Vale; and I hope
that thou art content therewith, and as happy as I would wish
thee to be.&nbsp; Well, this is the first time; and when thou
comest the second time it may well be that the world shall be
growing better.&rsquo;
She held the distaff which she bore in her hand (for she had
been spinning) as if it were a spear; her limbs were goodly and
shapely, and she trod the thick grass of the Vale with a kind of
wary firmness, as though foemen might be lurking nearby.&nbsp;
The Sun-beam smiled upon her kindly and said:
&lsquo;That shall not fail to be, Bow-may: ye have won a new
friend p.
129to-day.&nbsp; But tell me, when dost thou look to see
the men here, for I was down by the water when they went away
yesterday?&rsquo;
&lsquo;They shall come into the Dale a little after
sunset,&rsquo; said Bow-may.
&lsquo;Shall I abide them, my friend?&rsquo; said Gold-mane,
turning to the Sun-beam.
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;for what else art thou
come hither? or art thou so pressed to depart from us?&nbsp; Last
time we met thou wert not so hasty to sunder.&rsquo;
They smiled on each other; and Bow-may looked on them and
laughed outright; then a flush showed in her cheeks through the
tan of them, and she turned toward the children and the other
women who were busied about the milking of the kine.
But those two sat down together on a bank amidst the plain
meadow, facing the river and the eastern rock-wall, and the
Sun-beam said:
&lsquo;I am fain to speak to thee and to see thine eyes
watching me while I speak; and now, my friend, I will tell thee
something unasked which has to do with what e&rsquo;en now thou
didst ask me; for I would have thee trust me wholly, and know me
for what I am.&nbsp; Time was I schemed and planned for this day
of betrothal; but now I tell thee it has become no longer needful
for bringing to pass our fellowship in arms with thy
people.&nbsp; Yea yesterday, ere he went on a hunt, whereof he
shall tell thee, Folk-might was against it, in words at least;
and yet as one who would have it done if he might have no part in
it.&nbsp; So, in good sooth, this hand that lieth in thine is the
hand of a wilful woman, who desireth a man, and would keep him
for her speech-friend.&nbsp; Now art thou fond and happy; yet
bear in mind that there are deeds to be done, and the troth we
have just plighted must be paid for.&nbsp; So hearken, I bid
thee.&nbsp; Dost thou care to know why the wheedling of thee is
no longer needful to us?&rsquo;
He said: &lsquo;A little while ago I should have said, Yea, If
thy lips say the words.&nbsp; But now, O friend, it seemeth as if
thine p.
130heart were already become a part of mine, and I feel as
if the chieftain were growing up in me and the longing for deeds:
so I say, Tell me, for I were fain to hear what toucheth the
welfare of thy Folk and their fellowship with my Folk; for on
that also have I set my heart?&rsquo;
She said gravely and with solemn eyes:
&lsquo;What thou sayest is good: full glad am I that I have
not plighted my troth to a mere goodly lad, but rather to a
chieftain and a warrior.&nbsp; Now then hearken!&nbsp; Since I
saw thee first in the autumn this hath happened, that the Dusky
Men, increasing both in numbers and insolence, have it in their
hearts to win more than Silver-dale, and it is years since they
have fallen upon Rose-dale and conquered it, rather by murder
than by battle, and made all men thralls there, for feeble were
the Folk thereof; and doubt it not but that they will look into
Burgdale before long.&nbsp; They are already abroad in the woods,
and were it not for the fear of the Wolf they would be thicker
therein, and faring wider; for we have slain many of them, coming
upon them unawares; and they know not where we dwell, nor who we
be: so they fear to spread about over-much and pry into unknown
places lest the Wolf howl on them.&nbsp; Yet beware! for they
will gather in numbers that we may not meet, and then will they
swarm into the Dale; and if ye would live your happy life that ye
love so well, ye must now fight for it; and in that battle must
ye needs join yourselves to us, that we may help each
other.&nbsp; Herein have ye nought to choose, for now with you it
is no longer a thing to talk of whether ye will help certain
strangers and guests and thereby win some gain to yourselves, but
whether ye have the hearts to fight for yourselves, and the wits
to be the fellows of tall men and stout warriors who have pledged
their lives to win or die for it.&rsquo;
She was silent a little and then turned and looked fondly on
Face-of-god and said:
&lsquo;Therefore, Gold-mane, we need thee no longer; for thou
must needs fight in our battle.&nbsp; I have no longer aught to
do to wheedle p.
131thee to love me.&nbsp; Yet if thou wilt love me, then
am I a glad woman.&rsquo;
He said: &lsquo;Thou wottest well that thou hast all my love,
neither will I fail thee in the battle.&nbsp; I am not
little-hearted, though I would have given myself to thee for no
reward.&rsquo;
&lsquo;It is well,&rsquo; said the Sun-beam; &lsquo;nought is
undone by that which I have done.&nbsp; Moreover, it is good that
we have plighted troth to-day.&nbsp; For Folk-might will
presently hear thereof, and he must needs abide the thing which
is done.&nbsp; Hearken! he cometh.&rsquo;
For as she spoke there came a glad cry from the women and
children, and those two stood up and turned toward the west and
beheld the warriors of the Wolf coming down into the Dale by the
way that Gold-mane had come.
&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said the Sun-beam, &lsquo;here are your
brethren in arms, let us go greet them; they will rejoice in
thee.&rsquo;
So they went thither, and there stood eighty and seven men on
the grass below the scree and Folk-might their captain; and
besides some valiant women, and a few carles who were on watch on
the waste, and a half score who had been left in the Dale, these
were all the warriors of the Wolf.&nbsp; They were clad in no
holiday raiment, not even Folk-might, but were in sheep-brown
gear of the coarsest, like to husbandmen late come from the
plough, but armed well and goodly.
But when the twain drew near, the men clashed their spears on
their shields, and cried out for joy of them, for they all knew
what Face-of-god&rsquo;s presence there betokened of fellowship
with the kindreds; but Folk-might came forward and took
Face-of-god&rsquo;s hand and greeted him and said:
&lsquo;Hail, son of the Alderman!&nbsp; Here hast thou come
into the ancient abode of chieftains and warriors, and belike
deeds await thee also.&rsquo;
Yet his brow was knitted as he said these words, and he spake
slowly, as one that constraineth himself; but presently his face
cleared somewhat and he said:
p.
132&lsquo;Dalesman, it behoveth thy people to bestir them
if ye would live and see good days.&nbsp; Hath my sister told
thee what is toward?&nbsp; Or what sayest thou?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Hail to thee, son of the Wolf!&rsquo; said
Face-of-god.&nbsp; &lsquo;Thy sister hath told me all; and even
if these Dusky Felons were not our foe-men also, yet could I have
my way, we should have given thee all help, and should have
brought back peace and good days to thy folk.&rsquo;
Then Folk-might flushed red and spake, as he cast out his hand
towards the warriors and up and down toward the Dale:
&lsquo;These be my folk, and these only: and as to peace, only
those of us know of it who are old men.&nbsp; Yet is it well; and
if we and ye together be strong enough to bring back good days to
the feeble men whom the Dusky Ones torment in Silver-dale it
shall be better yet.&rsquo;
Then he turned about to his sister, and looked keenly into her
eyes till she reddened, and took her hand and looked at the wrist
and said:
&lsquo;O sister, see I not the mark on thy wrist of the Ring
of the God of the Earth?&nbsp; Have not oaths been sworn since
yesterday?&rsquo;
&lsquo;True it is,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that this man and I
have plighted troth together at the altar of the
Doom-ring.&rsquo;
Said Folk-might: &lsquo;Thou wilt have thy will, and I may not
amend it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Therewith he turned about to Face-of-god
and said:
&lsquo;Thou must look to it to keep this oath, whatever other
one thou hast failed in.&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god somewhat wrathfully: &lsquo;I shall keep it,
whether thou biddest me to keep it or break it.&rsquo;
&lsquo;That is well,&rsquo; said Folk-might, &lsquo;and then
for all that hath gone before thou mayest in a manner pay, if
thou art dauntless before the foe.&rsquo;
&lsquo;I look to be no blencher in the battle,&rsquo; said
Face-of-god; &lsquo;that is not the fashion of our kindred,
whosoever may be before us.&nbsp; Yea, and even were it thy
blade, O mighty warrior of the Wolf, I would do my best to meet
it in manly fashion.&rsquo;
p. 133As he
spake he half drew forth Dale-warden from his sheath, looking
steadily into the eyes of Folk-might; and the Sun-beam looked
upon him happily.&nbsp; But Folk-might laughed and said:
&lsquo;Thy sword is good, and I deem that thine heart will not
fail thee; but it is by my side and not in face of me that thou
shalt redden the good blade: I see not the day when we twain
shall hew at each other.&rsquo;
Then in a while he spake again:
&lsquo;Thou must pardon us if our words are rough; for we have
stood in rough places, where we had to speak both short and loud,
whereas there was much to do.&nbsp; But now will we twain talk of
matters that concern chieftains who are going on a hard
adventure.&nbsp; And ye women, do ye dight the Hall for the
evening feast, which shall be the feast of the troth-plight for
you twain.&nbsp; This indeed we owe thee, O guest; for little
shall be thine heritage which thou shalt have with my sister,
over and above that thy sword winneth for thee.&rsquo;
But the Sun-beam said: &lsquo;Hast thou any
to-night?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;Spear-god, how many was
it?&rsquo;
There came forward a tall man bearing an axe in his right
hand, and carrying over his shoulder by his left hand a bundle of
silver arm-rings just such as Gold-mane had seen on the felons
who were slain by Wood-grey&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; The carle cast
them on the ground and then knelt down and fell to telling them
over; and then looked up and said: &lsquo;Twelve yesterday in the
wood where the battle was going on; and this morning seven by the
tarn in the pine-wood and six near this eastern edge of the wood:
one score and five all told.&nbsp; But, Folk-might, they are
coming nigh to Shadowy Vale.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Sooth is that,&rsquo; said Folk-might; &lsquo;but it
shall be looked to.&nbsp; Come now apart with me,
Face-of-god.&rsquo;
So the others went their ways toward the Hall, while
Folk-might led the Burgdaler to a sheltered nook under the sheer
rocks, and there they sat down to talk, and Folk-might asked  a
name="page134">p. 134Gold-mane
closely of the muster of the Dalesmen and the Shepherds and the
Woodland Caries, and he was well pleased when Face-of-god told
him of how many could march to a stricken field, and of their
archery, and of their weapons and their goodness.
All this took some time in the telling, and now night was
coming on apace, and Folk-might said:
&lsquo;Now will it be time to go to the Hall; but keep in thy
mind that these Dusky Men will overrun you unless ye deal with
them betimes.&nbsp; These are of the kind that ye must cast fear
into their hearts by falling on them; for if ye abide till they
fall upon you, they are like the winter wolves that swarm on and
on, how many soever ye slay.&nbsp; And this above all things
shall help you, that we shall bring you whereas ye shall fall on
them unawares and destroy them as boys do with a wasp&rsquo;s
nest.&nbsp; Yet shall many a mother&rsquo;s son bite the
dust.
&lsquo;Is it not so that in four weeks&rsquo; time is your
spring-feast and market at Burgstead, and thereafter the great
Folk-mote?&rsquo;
&lsquo;So it is,&rsquo; said Gold-mane.
&lsquo;Thither shall I come then,&rsquo; said Folk-might,
&lsquo;and give myself out for the slayer of Rusty and the
ransacker of Harts-bane and Penny-thumb; and therefor shall I
offer good blood-wite and theft-wite; and thy father shall take
that; for he is a just man.&nbsp; Then shall I tell my
tale.&nbsp; Yet it may be thou shalt see us before if battle
betide.&nbsp; And now fair befall this new year; for soon shall
the scabbards be empty and the white swords be dancing in the
air, and spears and axes shall be the growth of this
spring-tide.&rsquo;
And he leaped up from his seat and walked to and fro before
Gold-mane, and now was it grown quite dark.&nbsp; Then Folk-might
turned to Face-of-god and said:
&lsquo;Come, guest, the windows of the Hall are yellow; let us
to the feast.&nbsp; To-morrow shalt thou get thee to the
beginning of this work.&nbsp; I hope of thee that thou art a good
sword; else have I p.
135done a folly and my sister a worse one.&nbsp; But now
forget that, and feast.&rsquo;
Gold-mane arose, not very well at ease, for the man seemed
overbearing; yet how might he fall upon the Sun-beam&rsquo;s
kindred, and the captain of these new brethren in arms?&nbsp; So
he spake not.&nbsp; But Folk-might said to him:
&lsquo;Yet I would not have thee forget that I was wroth with
thee when I saw thee to-day; and had it not been for the coming
battle I had drawn sword upon thee.&rsquo;
Then Face-of-god&rsquo;s wrath was stirred, and he said:
&lsquo;There is yet time for that! but why art thou wroth with
me?&nbsp; And I shall tell thee that there is little manliness in
thy chiding.&nbsp; For how may I fight with thee, thou the
brother of my plighted speech-friend and my captain in this
battle?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Therein thou sayest sooth,&rsquo; said Folk-might;
&lsquo;but hard it was to see you two standing together; and thou
canst not give the Bride to me as I give my sister to thee.&nbsp;
For I have seen her, and I have seen her looking at thee; and I
know that she will not have it so.&rsquo;
Then they went on together toward the Hall, and Face-of-god
was silent and somewhat troubled; and as they drew near to the
Hall, Folk-might spake again:
&lsquo;Yet time may amend it; and if not, there is the battle,
and maybe the end.&nbsp; Now be we merry!&rsquo;
So they went into the Hall together, and there was the
Sun-beam gloriously arrayed, as erst in the woodland bower, and
Face-of-god sat on the da&iuml;s beside her, and the uttermost
sweetness of desire entered into his soul as he noted her eyes
and her mouth, that were grown so kind to him, and her hand that
strayed toward his.
The Hall was full of folk, and all those warriors were there
with Wood-father and his sons, and Wood-mother, and Bow-may and
many other women; and Gold-mane looked down the Hall and deemed
that he had never seen such stalwarth bodies of men, or  a
name="page136">p. 136so bold and
meet for battle: as for the women he had seen fairer in Burgdale,
but these were fair of their own fashion, shapely and well-knit,
and strong-armed and large-limbed, yet sweet-voiced and gentle
withal.&nbsp; Nay, the very lads of fifteen winters or so,
whereof a few were there, seemed bold and bright-eyed and keen of
wit, and it seemed like that if the warriors fared afield these
would be with them.
So wore the feast; and Folk-might as aforetime amongst the
healths called on men to drink to the Jaws of the Wolf, and the
Red Hand, and the Silver Arm, and the Golden Bushel, and the
Ragged Sword.&nbsp; But now had Face-of-god no need to ask what
these meant, since he knew that they were the names of the
kindreds of the Wolf.&nbsp; They drank also to the troth-plight
and to those twain, and shouted aloud over the health and clashed
their weapons: and Gold-mane wondered what echo of that shout
would reach to Burgstead.
Then sang men songs of old time, and amongst them Wood-wont
stood with his fiddle amidst the Hall and Bow-may beside him, and
they sang in turn to it sweetly and clearly; and this is some of
what they sang:
She singeth.
Wild is the waste and long leagues over;
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whither then wend ye spear and sword,
Where nought shall see your helms but the plover,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Far and far from the dear Dale&rsquo;s sward?
He singeth.
Many a league shall we wend together
&nbsp;&nbsp; With helm and spear and bended bow.
Hark! how the wind blows up for weather:
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dark shall the night be whither we go.
Dark shall the night be round the byre,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And dark as we drive the brindled kine;
p. 137Dark and
dark round the beacon-fire,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dark down in the pass round our wavering line.
Turn on thy path, O fair-foot maiden,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And come our ways by the pathless road;
Look how the clouds hang low and laden
&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the walls of the old abode!
She singeth.
Bare are my feet for the rough waste&rsquo;s
wending,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wild is the wind, and my kirtle&rsquo;s thin;
Faint shall I be ere the long way&rsquo;s ending
&nbsp;&nbsp; Drops down to the Dale and the grief therein.
He singeth.
Do on the brogues of the wild-wood rover,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Do on the byrnies&rsquo; ring-close mail;
Take thou the staff that the barbs hang over,
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er the wind and the waste and the way to
prevail.
Come, for how from thee shall I sunder?
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, that a tale may arise in the land;
Come, that the night may be held for a wonder,
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Wolf was led by a maiden&rsquo;s hand!
She singeth.
Now will I fare as ye are faring,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wend no way but the way ye wend;
And bear but the burdens ye are bearing,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And end the day as ye shall end.
And many an eve when the clouds are drifting br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Down through the Dale till they dim the roof,
Shall they tell in the Hall of the Maiden&rsquo;s Lifting,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And how we drave the spoil aloof.
 span
class="pagenum">p. 138They sing together.
Over the moss through the wind and the
weather,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the morn and the eve and the death of the
day,
Wend we man and maid together,
&nbsp;&nbsp; For out of the waste is born the fray.
Then the Sun-beam spake to Gold-mane softly, and told him how
this song was made by a minstrel concerning a foray in the early
days of their first abode in Shadowy Vale, and how in good sooth
a maiden led the fray and was the captain of the warriors:
&lsquo;Erst,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;this was counted as a
wonder; but now we are so few that it is no wonder though the
women will do whatsoever they may.&rsquo;
So they talked, and Gold-mane was very happy; but ere the
good-night cup was drunk, Folk-might spake to Face-of-god and
said:
&lsquo;It were well that ye rose betimes in the morning: but
thou shalt not go back by the way thou camest.&nbsp; Wood-wise
and another shall go with thee, and show thee a way across the
necks and the heaths, which is rough enough as far as toil goes,
but where thy life shall be safer; and thereby shalt thou hit the
ghyll of the Weltering Water, and so come down safely into
Burgdale.&nbsp; Now that we are friends and fellows, it is no
hurt for thee to know the shortest way to Shadowy Vale.&nbsp;
What thou shalt tell concerning us in Burgdale I leave the tale
thereof to thee; yet belike thou wilt not tell everything till I
come to Burgstead at the spring market-tide.&nbsp; Now must I
presently to bed; for before daylight to-morrow must I be
following the hunt along with two score good men of
ours.&rsquo;
&lsquo;What beast is afield then?&rsquo; said Gold-mane.
Said Folk-might: &lsquo;The beasts that beset our lives, the
Dusky Men.&nbsp; In these days we have learned how to find
companies of them; and forsooth every week they draw nigher to
this Dale; and some day they should happen upon us if we were not
to look p.
139to it, and then would there be a murder great and grim;
therefore we scour the heaths round about, and the skirts of the
woodland, and we fall upon these felons in divers guises, so that
they may not know us for the same men; whiles are we clad in
homespun, as to-day, and seem like to field-working carles;
whiles in scarlet and gold, like knights of the Westland; whiles
in wolf-skins; whiles in white glittering gear, like the Wights
of the Waste: and in all guises these felons, for all their
fierce hearts, fear us, and flee from us, and we follow and slay
them, and so minish their numbers somewhat against the great day
of battle.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Tell me,&rsquo; said Gold-mane; &lsquo;when we fall
upon Silver-dale shall their thralls, the old Dale-dwellers,
fight for them or for us?&rsquo;
Said Folk-might: &lsquo;The Dusky Men will not dare to put
weapons into the hands of their thralls.&nbsp; Nay, the thralls
shall help us; for though they have but small stomach for the
fight, yet joyfully when the fight is over shall they cut their
masters&rsquo; throats.&rsquo;
&lsquo;How is it with these thralls?&rsquo; said
Gold-mane.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have never seen a thrall.&rsquo;
&lsquo;But I,&rsquo; said Folk-might, &lsquo;have seen a many
down in the Cities.&nbsp; And there were thralls who were the
tyrants of thralls, and held the whip over them; and of the
others there were some who were not very hardly entreated.&nbsp;
But with these it is otherwise, and they all bear grievous pains
daily; for the Dusky Men are as hogs in a garden of lilies.&nbsp;
Whatsoever is fair there have they defiled and deflowered, and
they wallow in our fair halls as swine strayed from the
dunghill.&nbsp; No delight in life, no sweet days do they have
for themselves, and they begrudge the delight of others
therein.&nbsp; Therefore their thralls know no rest or solace;
their reward of toil is many stripes, and the healing of their
stripes grievous toil.&nbsp; To many have they appointed to dig
and mine in the silver-yielding cliffs, and of all the tasks is
that the sorest, and there do stripes abound the most.&nbsp; Such
thralls art thou happy not to behold till thou hast set them
free; as we shall do.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Tell me again,&rsquo; said Face-of-god; &lsquo;Is there
no mixed folk p.
140between these Dusky Men and the Dalesmen, since they
have no women of their own, but lie with the women of the
Dale?&nbsp; Moreover, do not the poor folk of the Dale beget and
bear children, so that there are thralls born of
thralls?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Wisely thou askest this,&rsquo; said Folk-might,
&lsquo;but thereof shall I tell thee, that when a Dusky Carle
mingles with a woman of the Dale, the child which she beareth
shall oftenest favour his race and not hers; or else shall it be
witless, a fool natural.&nbsp; But as for the children of these
poor thralls; yea, the masters cause them to breed if so their
masterships will, and when the children are born, they keep them
or slay them as they will, as they would with whelps or
calves.&nbsp; To be short, year by year these vile wretches grow
fiercer and more beastly, and their thralls more hapless and
down-trodden; and now at last is come the time either to do or to
die, as ye men of Burgdale shall speedily find out.&nbsp; But now
must I go sleep if I am to be where I look to be at sunrise
to-morrow.&rsquo;
Therewith he called for the sleeping-cup, and it was drunk,
and all men fared to bed.&nbsp; But the Sun-beam took
Gold-mane&rsquo;s hand ere they parted, and said:
&lsquo;I shall arise betimes on the morrow; so I say not
farewell to-night; yea, and after to-morrow it shall not be long
ere we meet again.&rsquo;
So Gold-mane lay down in that ancient hall, and it seemed to
him ere he slept as if his own kindred were slipping away from
him and he were becoming a child of the Wolf.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
yet,&rsquo; said he to himself, &lsquo;I am become a man; for my
Friend, now she no longer telleth me to do or forbear, and I
tremble.&nbsp; Nay, rather she is fain to take the word from me;
and this great warrior and ripe man, he talketh with me as if I
were a chieftain meet for converse with chieftains.&nbsp; Even so
it is and shall be.&rsquo;
And soon thereafter he fell asleep in the Hall in Shadowy
Vale.
p.
141CHAPTER XXI.&nbsp; FACE-OF-GOD LOOKETH ON THE DUSKY
MEN.
When he awoke again he saw a man
standing over him, and knew him for Wood-wise: he was clad in his
war-gear, and had his quiver at his back and his bow in his hand,
for Wood-father&rsquo;s children were all good bowmen, though not
so sure as Bow-may.&nbsp; He spake to Face-of-god:
&lsquo;Dawn is in the sky, Dalesman; there is yet time for
thee to wash the night off of thee in our bath of the Shivering
Flood and to put thy mouth to the milk-bowl; but time for nought
else: for I and Bow-may are appointed thy fellows for the road,
and it were well that we were back home speedily.&rsquo;
So Face-of-god leapt up and went forth from the Hall, and
Wood-wise led to where was a pool in the river with steps cut
down to it in the rocky bank.
&lsquo;This,&rsquo; said Wood-wise, &lsquo;is the
Carle&rsquo;s Bath; but the Queen&rsquo;s is lower down, where
the water is wider and shallower below the little mid-dale
force.&rsquo;
So Gold-mane stripped off his raiment and leapt into the
ice-cold pool; and they had brought his weapons and war-gear with
them; so when he came out he clad and armed himself for the road,
and then turned with Wood-wise toward the outgate of the Dale;
and soon they saw two men coming from lower down the water in
such wise that they would presently cross their path, and as yet
it was little more than twilight, so that they saw not at first
who they were, but as they drew nearer they knew them for the
Sun-beam and Bow-may.&nbsp; The Sun-beam was clad but in her
white linen smock and blue gown as he had first seen her, her
hair was wet and dripping with the river, her face fresh and
rosy: she carried in her two hands a great bowl of milk, and
stepped delicately, lest she should spill it.&nbsp; But Bow-may
was clad in her war-gear with helm and byrny, and a quiver at her
back, and a bended bow in her hand.&nbsp; So they greeted  a
name="page142">p. 142each other
kindly, and the Sun-beam gave the bowl to Face-of-god and
said:
&lsquo;Drink, guest, for thou hast a long and thirsty road
before thee.&rsquo;
So Face-of-god drank, and gave her the bowl back again, and
she smiled on him and drank, and the others after her till the
bowl was empty: then Bow-may put her hand on Wood-wise&rsquo;s
shoulder, and they led on toward the outgate, while those twain
followed them hand in hand.&nbsp; But the Sun-beam said:
&lsquo;This then is the new day I spoke of, and lo! it
bringeth our sundering with it; yet shall it be no longer than a
day when all is said, and new days shall follow after.&nbsp; And
now, my friend, I shall see thee no later than the April market;
for doubt not that I shall go thither with Folk-might, whether he
will or not.&nbsp; Also as I led thee out of the house when we
last met, so shall I lead thee out of the Dale to-day, and I will
go with thee a little way on the waste; and therefore am I shod
this morning, as thou seest, for the ways on the waste are
rough.&nbsp; And now I bid thee have courage while my hand
holdeth thine.&nbsp; For afterwards I need not bid thee anything;
for thou wilt have enough to do when thou comest to thy Folk, and
must needs think more of warriors then than of
maidens.&rsquo;
He looked at her and longed for her, but said soberly:
&lsquo;Thou art kind, O friend, and thinkest kindly of me
ever.&nbsp; But methinks it were not well done for thee to wend
with me over a deal of the waste, and come back by thyself alone,
when ye have so many foemen nearby.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;they be nought so near as
that yet, and I wot that Folk-might hath gone forth toward the
north-west, where he looketh to fall in with a company of the
foemen.&nbsp; His battle shall be a guard unto us.&rsquo;
&lsquo;I pray thee turn back at the top of the outgate,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;and be not venturesome.&nbsp; Thou wottest that
the pitcher is not broken the first time it goeth to the well,
nor maybe the twentieth, but at last it cometh not
back.&rsquo;
p. 143She
said: &lsquo;Nevertheless I shall have my will herein.&nbsp; And
it is but a little way I will wend with thee.&rsquo;
Therewith were they come to the scree, and talk fell down
between them as they clomb it; but when they were in the darksome
passage of the rocks, and could scarce see one another,
Face-of-god said:
&lsquo;Where then is another outgate from the Dale?&nbsp; Is
it not up the water?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and there is none other:
at the lower end the rocks rise sheer from out the water, and a
little further down is a great force thundering betwixt them; so
that by no boat or raft may ye come out of the Dale.&nbsp; But
the outgate up the water is called the Road of War, as this is
named the Path of Peace.&nbsp; But now are all ways ways of
war.&rsquo;
&lsquo;There is peace in my heart,&rsquo; said Gold-mane.
She answered not for a while, but pressed his hand, and he
felt her breath on his cheek; and even therewithal they came out
of the dark, and Gold-mane saw that her cheek was flushed; and
now she spake:
&lsquo;One thing would I say to thee, my friend.&nbsp; Thou
hast seen me amongst men of war, amongst outlaws who seek
violence; thou hast heard me bid my brother to count the slain,
and I shrinking not; thou knowest (for I have told thee) how I
have schemed and schemed for victorious battle.&nbsp; Yet I would
not have thee think of me as a Chooser of the Slain, a warrior
maiden, or as of one who hath no joy save in the battle whereto
she biddeth others.&nbsp; O friend, the many peaceful hours that
I have had on the grass down yonder, sitting with my rock and
spindle in hand, the children round about my knees hearkening to
some old story so well remembered by me! or the milking of the
kine in the dewy summer even, when all was still but for the
voice of the water and the cries of the happy children, and there
round about me were the dear and beauteous maidens with whom I
had grown up, happy amidst all our troubles, since their life was
free and p.
144they knew no guile.&nbsp; In such times my heart was at
peace indeed, and it seemed to me as if we had won all we needed;
as if war and turmoil were over, after they had brought about
peace and good days for our little folk.
&lsquo;And as for the days that be, are they not as that
rugged pass, full of bitter winds and the voice of hurrying
waters, that leadeth yonder to Silver-dale, as thou hast divined?
and there is nought good in it save that the breath of life is
therein, and that it leadeth to pleasant places and the peace and
plenty of the fair dale.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Sweet friend,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;what thou sayest
is better than well: for time shall be, if we come alive out of
this pass of battle and bitter strife, when I shall lead thee
into Burgdale to dwell there.&nbsp; And thou wottest of our
people that there is little strife and grudging amongst them, and
that they are merry, and fair to look on, both men and women; and
no man there lacketh what the earth may give us, and it is a
saying amongst us that there may a man have that which he
desireth save the sun and moon in his hands to play with: and of
this gladness, which is made up of many little matters, what
story may be told?&nbsp; Yet amongst it shall I live and thou
with me; and ill indeed it were if it wearied thee and thou wert
ever longing for some day of victorious strife, and to behold me
coming back from battle high-raised on the shields of men and
crowned with bay; if thine ears must ever be tickled with the
talk of men and their songs concerning my warrior deeds.&nbsp;
For thus it shall not be.&nbsp; When I drive the herds it shall
be at the neighbours&rsquo; bidding whereso they will; not necks
of men shall I smite, but the stalks of the tall wheat, and the
boles of the timber-trees which the woodreeve hath marked for
felling; the stilts of the plough rather than the hilts of the
sword shall harden my hands; my shafts shall be for the deer, and
my spears for the wood-boar, till war and sorrow fall upon us,
and I fight for the ceasing of war and trouble.&nbsp; And though
I be called a chief and of the blood of chiefs, yet shall I not
be masterful to the goodman of the Dale, but rather to my hound;
for my chieftainship  span
class="pagenum">p. 145shall be that I shall be well
beloved and trusted, and that no man shall grudge against
me.&nbsp; Canst thou learn to love such a life, which to me
seemeth lovely?&nbsp; And thou? of whom I say that thou art as if
thou wert come down from the golden chairs of the Burg of the
Gods.&rsquo;
They were well-nigh out of the steep path by now, and the
daylight was bright about them; there she stayed her feet a
moment and turned to him and said:
&lsquo;All this should I love even now, if the grief of our
Folk were but healed, and hereafter shall I learn yet more of thy
well-beloved face.&rsquo;
Therewith she laid her face to his and kissed him fondly, and
put his hand to her side and held it there, saying: &lsquo;Soon
shall we be one in body and in soul.&rsquo;
And he laughed with joy and pride of life, and took her hand
and led her on again, and said:
&lsquo;Yet feel the cold rings of my hauberk, my friend; look
at the spears that cumber my hand, and at Dale-warden hanging by
my side.&nbsp; Thou shalt yet see me as the Slain&rsquo;s Chooser
would see her speech-friend; for there is much to do ere we win
wheat-harvest in Burgdale.&rsquo;
Therewith they stepped together on to the level ground of the
waste, and saw Bow-may sitting on a stone hard by, and Wood-wise
standing beside her bending his bow.&nbsp; Bow-may smiled on
Gold-mane and rose up, and they all went on together, turning so
that they went nearly alongside the wall of the Vale, but
westering a little; then the Sun-beam said:
&lsquo;Many a time have I trodden this heath alongside our
rock-wall; for if ye wend a little further as our faces are
turned, ye come to the crags over the place where the Shivering
Flood goeth out of Shadowy Vale.&nbsp; There when ye have clomb a
little may&rsquo;st thou stand on the edge of the rock-wall, and
look down and behold the Flood swirling and eddying in the black
gorge of the rocks, and see presently the reek of the force go
up, and hear the p.
146thunder of the waters as they pour over it: and all
this about us now is as the garden of our house&mdash;is it not
so, Bow-may?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;and there are goodly
cluster-berries to be gotten hereabout in the autumn; many a time
have the Sun-beam and I reddened our lips with them.&nbsp; Yet is
it best to be wary when war is abroad and hot withal.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said the Sun-beam, &lsquo;and all this
place comes into the story of our House: lo!&nbsp; Gold-mane, two
score paces before us a little on our right hand those five grey
stones.&nbsp; They are called the Rocks of the Elders: for there
in the first days of our abiding in Shadowy Vale the Elders were
wont to come together to talk privily upon our
matters.&rsquo;
Face-of-god looked thither as she spoke, but therewith saw
Bow-may, who went on the left hand of the Sun-beam, as
Face-of-god on her right hand, notch a shaft on her bent bow, and
Wood-wise, who was on his right hand, saw it also and did the
like, and therewithal Face-of-god got his target on to his arm,
and even as he did so Bow-may cried out suddenly:
&lsquo;Yea, yea!&nbsp; Cast thyself on to the ground,
Sun-beam!&nbsp; Gold-mane, targe and spear, targe and
spear!&nbsp; For I see steel gleaming yonder out from behind the
Elders&rsquo; Rocks.&rsquo;
Scarce were the words out of her mouth ere three shafts came
flying, and the bow-strings twanged.&nbsp; Gold-mane felt that
one smote his helm and glanced from it.&nbsp; Therewithal he saw
the Sun-beam fall to earth, though he knew not if she had but
cast herself down as Bow-may bade.&nbsp; Bow-may&rsquo;s string
twanged at once, and a yell came from the foemen: but Wood-wise
loosed not, but set his hand to his mouth and gave a loud wild
cry&mdash;Ha! ha! ha! ha!&nbsp; How-ow-ow!&mdash;ending in a long
and exceeding great whoop like nought but the wolf&rsquo;s
howl.&nbsp; Now Gold-mane thinking swiftly, in a moment of time,
as war-meet men do, judged that if the Sun-beam were hurt (and
she had made no cry), it were yet wiser to fall on the foe before
turning to tend her, or else all might be lost; so he rushed
forward spear in hand and target on  span
class="pagenum">p. 147arm, and saw, as he opened up the
flank of the Elders&rsquo; Rocks, six men, whereof one leaned
aback on the rock with Bow-may&rsquo;s shaft in his shoulder, and
two others were just in act of loosing at him.&nbsp; In a moment,
as he rushed at them, one shaft went whistling by him, and the
other glanced from off his target; he cast a spear as he bounded
on, and saw it smite one of the shooters full in the naked face,
and saw the blood spout out and change his face and the man roll
over, and then in another moment four men were hewing at him with
their short steel axes.&nbsp; He thrust out his target against
them, and then let the weight of his body come on his other
spear, and drave it through the second shooter&rsquo;s throat,
and even therewith was smitten on the helm so hard that, though
the Alderman&rsquo;s work held out, he fell to his knees, holding
his target over his head and striving to draw forth Dale-warden;
in that nick of time a shaft whistled close by his ear, and as he
rose to his feet again he saw his foeman rolling over and over,
clutching at the ling with both hands.&nbsp; Then rang out again
the terrible wolf-whoop from Wood-wise&rsquo;s mouth, and both he
and Bow-may loosed a shaft, for the two other foes had turned
their backs and were fleeing fast.&nbsp; Again Bow-may hit the
clout, and the Dusky Man fell dead at once, but Wood-wise&rsquo;s
arrow flew over the felon&rsquo;s shoulder as he ran.&nbsp; Then
in a trice was Gold-mane bounding after him like the hare just
roused from her form; for it came into his head that these felons
had beheld them coming up out of the Vale, and that if even this
one man escaped, he would bring his company down upon the
Vale-dwellers.
Strong and light-foot as any was Face-of-god, and though he
was cumbered with his hauberk, yet was Iron-face&rsquo;s
handiwork far lighter than the war-coat of the Dusky Man, and the
race was soon over.&nbsp; The felon turned breathless to meet
Gold-mane, who drave his target against him and cast him to
earth, and as he strove to rise smote off his head at one stroke;
for Dale-warden was a good sword and the Dalesman as fierce of
mood as might be.&nbsp; There he let the felon lie, and, turning,
walked p.
148back swiftly toward the Elders&rsquo; Rocks, and found
there Wood-wise and the dead foemen, for the carle had slain the
wounded, and he was now drawing the silver arm-rings off the
slain men; for all these Dusky Felons bore silver
arm-rings.&nbsp; But Bow-may was walking towards the Sun-beam,
and thitherward followed Gold-mane speedily.
He found her sitting on a tussock of grass close by where she
had fallen, her face pale, her eyes eager and gleaming; she
looked up at him as he drew nigher and said:
&lsquo;Friend, art thou hurt?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and thou?&nbsp; Thou art
pale.&rsquo;
&lsquo;I am not hurt,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; Then she smiled
and said again:
&lsquo;Did I not tell thee that I am no warrior like Bow-may
here?&nbsp; Such deeds make maidens pale.&rsquo;
Said Bow-may: &lsquo;If ye will have the truth, Gold-mane, she
is not wont to grow pale when battle is nigh her.&nbsp; Look you,
she hath had the gift of a new delight, and findeth it sweeter
and softer than she had any thought of; and now hath she feared
lest it should be taken from her.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Bow-may saith but the sooth,&rsquo; said the Sun-beam
simply, &lsquo;and kind it is of her to say it.&nbsp; I saw thee,
Bow-may, and good was thy shooting, and I love thee for
it.&rsquo;
Said Bow-may: &lsquo;I never shoot otherwise than well.&nbsp;
But those idle shooters of the Dusky Ones, whereabouts nigh to
thee went their shafts?&rsquo;
Said the Sun-beam: &lsquo;One just lifted the hair by my left
ear, and that was not so ill-aimed; as for the other, it pierced
my raiment by my right knee, and pinned me to the earth, so that
I tottered and fell, and my gown and smock are grievously
wounded, both of them.&rsquo;
And she took the folds of the garments in her hands to show
the rents therein; and her colour was come again, and she was
glad.
&lsquo;What were best to do now?&rsquo; she said.
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;Let us tarry a little; for some of
thy p.
149carles shall surely come up from the Vale: because they
will have heard Wood-wise&rsquo;s whoop, since the wind sets that
way.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, they will come,&rsquo; said the Sun-beam.
&lsquo;Good is that,&rsquo; said Face-of-god; &lsquo;for they
shall take the dead felons and cast them where they be not seen
if perchance any more stray hereby.&nbsp; For if they wind them,
they may well happen on the path down to the Vale.&nbsp; Also, my
friend, it were well if thou wert to bid a good few of the carles
that are in the Vale to keep watch and ward about here, lest
there be more foemen wandering about the waste.&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;Thou art wise in war, Gold-mane; I will do as
thou biddest me.&nbsp; But soothly this is a perilous thing that
the Dusky Men are gotten so close to the Vale.&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;This will Folk-might look to when he
cometh home; and it is most like that he will deem it good to
fall on them somewhere a good way aloof, so as to draw them off
from wandering over the waste.&nbsp; Also I will do my best to
busy them when I am home in Burgdale.&rsquo;
Therewith came up Wood-wise, and fell to talk with them; and
his mind it was that these foemen were but a band of strayers,
and had had no inkling of Shadowy Vale till they had heard them
talking together as they came up the path from the Vale, and that
then they had made that ambush behind the Elders&rsquo; Rocks, so
that they might slay the men, and then bear off the woman.&nbsp;
He said withal that it would be best to carry their corpses
further on, so that they might be cast over the cliffs into the
fierce stream of the Shivering Flood.
Amidst this talk came up men from the Vale, a score of them,
well armed; and they ran to meet the wayfarers; and when they
heard what had befallen, they rejoiced exceedingly, and were
above all glad that Face-of-god had shown himself doughty and
deft; and they deemed his rede wise, to set a watch thereabouts
till Folk-might came home, and said that they would do even
so.
Then spake the Sun-beam and said:
p.
150&lsquo;Now must ye wayfarers depart; for the road is
but rough, and the day not over-long.&rsquo;
Then she turned to Face-of-god and put her hand on his
shoulder, and brought her face close to his and spake to him
softly:
&lsquo;Doth this second parting seem at all strange to thee,
and that I am now so familiar to thee, I whom thou didst once
deem to be a very goddess?&nbsp; And now thou hast seen me redden
before thine eyes because of thee; and thou hast seen me grow
pale with fear because of thee; and thou hast felt my caresses
which I might not refrain; even as if I were altogether such a
maiden as ye warriors hang about for a nine days&rsquo; wonder,
and then all is over save an aching heart&mdash;wilt thou do so
with me?&nbsp; Tell me, have I not belittled myself before thee
as if I asked thee to scorn me?&nbsp; For thus desire dealeth
both with maid and man.&rsquo;
He said: &lsquo;In all this there is but one thing for me to
say, and that is that I love thee; and surely none the less, but
rather the more, because thou lovest me, and art of my kind, and
mayest share in my deeds and think well of them.&nbsp; Now is my
heart full of joy, and one thing only weigheth on it; and that is
that my kinswoman the Bride begrudgeth our love together.&nbsp;
For this is the thing that of all things most misliketh me, that
any should bear a grudge against me.&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;Forget not the token, and my message to
her.&rsquo;
&lsquo;I will not forget it,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
now I bid thee to kiss me even before all these that are looking
on; for there is nought to belittle us therein, since we be
troth-plight.&rsquo;
And indeed those folk stood all round about them gazing on
them, but a little aloof, that they might not hear their words if
they were minded to talk privily.&nbsp; For they had long loved
the Sun-beam, and now the love of Face-of-god had begun to spring
up in their hearts.
So the twain embraced and kissed one another, and made no
haste thereover; and those men deemed that but meet and right,
and clashed their weapons on their shields in token of their
joy.
p. 151Then
Face-of-god turned about and strode out of the ring of men, with
Bow-may and Wood-wise beside him, and they went on their journey
over the necks towards Burgstead.&nbsp; But the Sun-beam turned
slowly from that place toward the Vale, and two of the stoutest
carles went along with her to guard her from harm, and she went
down into the Vale pondering all these things in her heart.
Then the other carles dragged off the corpses of the Dusky Men
till they had brought them to the sheer rocks above the Shivering
Flood, and there they tossed them over into the boiling caldron
of the force, and so departed taking with them the silver
arm-rings of the slain to add to the tale.
But when they came back into the Vale the Sun-beam duly
ordered that watch and ward to keep the ingate thereto, and note
all that should befall till Folk-might came home.
CHAPTER XXII.&nbsp; FACE-OF-GOD COMETH HOME TO
BURGSTEAD.
But Face-of-god with Bow-may and
Wood-wise fared over the waste, going at first alongside the
cliffs of the Shivering Flood, and then afterwards turning
somewhat to the west.&nbsp; They soon had to climb a very high
and steep bent going up to a mountain-neck; and the way over the
neck was rough indeed when they were on it, and they toiled out
of it into a barren valley, and out of the valley again on to a
rough neck; and such-like their journey the day long, for they
were going athwart all those great dykes that went from the
ice-mountains toward the lower dales like the outspread fingers
of a hand or the roots of a great tree.&nbsp; And the
ice-mountains they had on their left hands and whiles at their
backs.
They went very warily, with their bows bended and spear in
hand, but saw no man, good or bad, and but few living
things.&nbsp; p.
152At noon they rested in a valley where was a stream, but
no grass, nought but stones and sand; but where they were at
least sheltered from the wind, which was mostly very great in
these high wastes; and there Bow-may drew meat and wine from a
wallet she bore, and they ate and drank, and were merry enough;
and Bow-may said:
&lsquo;I would I were going all the way with thee, Gold-mane;
for I long sore to let my eyes rest a while on the land where I
shall one day live.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;art thou minded to
dwell there?&nbsp; We shall be glad of that.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Whither are thy wits straying?&rsquo; said she;
&lsquo;whether I am minded to it or not, I shall dwell
there.&rsquo;
And Wood-wise nodded a yea to her.&nbsp; But Face-of-god
said:
&lsquo;Good will be thy dwelling; but wherefore must it be
so?&rsquo;
Then Wood-wise laughed and said: &lsquo;I shall tell thee in
fewer words than she will, and time presses now: Wood-father and
Wood-mother, and I and my two brethren and this woman have ever
been about and anigh the Sun-beam; and we deem that war and other
troubles have made us of closer kin to her than we were born,
whether ye call it brotherhood or what not, and never shall we
sunder from her in life or in death.&nbsp; So when thou goest to
Burgdale with her, there shall we be.&rsquo;
Then was Face-of-god glad when he found that they deemed his
wedding so settled and sure; but Wood-wise fell to making ready
for the road.&nbsp; And Face-of-god said to him:
&lsquo;Tell me one thing, Wood-wise; that whoop that thou
gavest forth when we were at handy-strokes e&rsquo;en
now&mdash;is it but a cry of thine own or is it of thy Folk, and
shall I hear it again?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Thou may&rsquo;st look to hear it many a time,&rsquo;
said Wood-wise, &lsquo;for it is the cry of the Wolf.&nbsp;
Seldom indeed hath battle been joined where men of our blood are,
but that cry is given forth.&nbsp; Come now, to the
road!&rsquo;
So they went their ways and the road worsened upon them, and
p. 153toilsome
was the climbing up steep bents and the scaling of doubtful paths
in the cliff-sides, so that the journey, though the distance of
it were not so long to the fowl flying, was much eked out for
them, and it was not till near nightfall that they came on the
ghyll of the Weltering Water some six miles above
Burgstead.&nbsp; Forsooth Wood-wise said that the way might be
made less toilsome though far longer by turning back eastward a
little past the vale where they had rested at midday; and that
seemed good to Gold-mane, in case they should be wending
hereafter in a great company between Burgdale and Shadowy
Vale.
But now those two went with Face-of-god down a path in the
side of the cliff whereby him-seemed he had gone before; and they
came down into the ghyll and sat down together on a stone by the
water-side, and Face-of-god spake to them kindly, for he deemed
them good and trusty faring-fellows.
&lsquo;Bow-may,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;thou saidst a while ago
that thou wouldst be fain to look on Burgdale; and indeed it is
fair and lovely, and ye may soon be in it if ye will.&nbsp; Ye
shall both be more than welcome to the house of my father, and
heartily I bid you thither.&nbsp; For night is on us, and the way
back is long and toilsome and beset with peril.&nbsp; Sister
Bow-may, thou wottest that it would be a sore grief to me if thou
camest to any harm, and thou also, fellow Wood-wise.&nbsp;
Daylight is a good faring-fellow over the waste.&rsquo;
Said Bow-may: &lsquo;Thou art kind, Gold-mane, and that is thy
wont, I know; and fain were I to-night of the candles in thine
hall.&nbsp; But we may not tarry; for thou wottest how busy we be
at home; and Sun-beam needeth me, if it were only to make her
sure that no Dusky Man is bearing off thine head by its lovely
locks.&nbsp; Neither shall we journey in the mirk night; for look
you, the moon yonder.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;parting is ill at
the best, and I would I could give you twain a gift, and
especially to thee, my sister Bow-may.&rsquo;
Said Wood-wise: &lsquo;Thou may&rsquo;st well do that; or at
least promise the gift; and that is all one as if we held it in
our hands.&rsquo;
p.
154&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said Bow-may, &lsquo;Wood-wise and I
have been thinking in one way belike; and I was at point to ask a
gift of thee.&rsquo;
&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; said Gold-mane.&nbsp; &lsquo;Surely
it is thine, if it were but a guerdon for thy good
shooting.&rsquo;
She laughed and handled the skirts of his hauberk as she
said:
&lsquo;Show us the dint in thine helm that the steel axe made
this morning.&rsquo;
&lsquo;There is no such great dint,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;my
father forged that helm, and his work is better than
good.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said Bow-may, &lsquo;and might I have
hauberk and helm of his handiwork, and Wood-wise a good sword of
the same, then were I a glad woman, and this man a happy
carle.&rsquo;
Said Gold-mane: &lsquo;I am well pleased at thine asking, and
so shall Iron-face be when he heareth of thine archery; and how
that Hall-face were now his only son but for thy close
shooting.&nbsp; But now must I to the way; for my heart tells me
that there may have been tidings in Burgstead this while I have
been aloof.&rsquo;
So they rose all three, and Bow-may said:
&lsquo;Thou art a kind brother, and soon shall we meet again;
and that will be well.&rsquo;
Then he put his hands on her shoulders and kissed both her
cheeks; and he kissed Wood-wise, and turned and went his ways,
threading the stony tangle about the Weltering Water, which was
now at middle height, and running clear and strong; so turning
once he beheld Wood-wise and Bow-may climbing the path up the
side of the ghyll, and Bow-may turned to him also and waved her
bow as token of farewell.&nbsp; Then he went upon his way, which
was rough enough to follow by night, though the moon was shining
brightly high aloft.&nbsp; Yet as he knew his road he made but
little of it all, and in somewhat more than an hour and a half
was come out of the pass into the broken ground at the head of
the Dale, and began to make his way speedily under the bright
moonlight toward the Gate, still going close by the water.&nbsp;
But as he went he heard of a sudden cries and rumour not far from
him, p.
155unwonted in that place, where none dwelt, and where the
only folk he might look to see were those who cast an angle into
the pools and eddies of the Water.&nbsp; Moreover, he saw about
the place whence came the cries torches moving swiftly hither and
thither; so that he looked to hear of new tidings, and stayed his
feet and looked keenly about him on every side; and just then,
between his rough path and the shimmer of the dancing moonlit
water, he saw the moon smite on something gleaming; so, as
quietly as he could, he got his target on his arm, and shortened
his spear in his right hand, and then turned sharply toward that
gleam.&nbsp; Even therewith up sprang a man on his right hand,
and then another in front of him just betwixt him and the water;
an axe gleamed bright in the moon, and he caught a great stroke
on his target, and therewith drave his left shoulder straight
forward, so that the man before him fell over into the water with
a mighty splash; for they were at the very edge of the deepest
eddy of the Water.&nbsp; Then he spun round on his heel, heeding
not that another stroke had fallen on his right shoulder, yet
ill-aimed, and not with the full edge, so that it ran down his
byrny and rent it not.&nbsp; So he sent the thrust of his spear
crashing through the face and skull of the smiter, and looked not
to him as he fell, but stood still, brandishing his spear and
crying out, &lsquo;For the Burg and the Face!&nbsp; For the Burg
and the Face!&rsquo;
No other foe came against him, but like to the echo of his cry
rose a clear shout not far aloof, &lsquo;For the Face, for the
Face!&nbsp; For the Burg and the Face!&rsquo;&nbsp; He muttered,
&lsquo;So ends the day as it begun,&rsquo; and shouted loud
again, &lsquo;For the Burg and the Face!&rsquo;&nbsp; And in a
minute more came breaking forth from the stone-heaps into the
moonlit space before the water the tall shapes of the men of
Burgstead, the red torchlight and the moonlight flashing back
from their war-gear and weapons; for every man had his sword or
spear in hand.
Hall-face was the first of them, and he threw his arms about
his brother and said: &lsquo;Well met, Gold-mane, though thou
comest p.
156amongst us like Stone-fist of the Mountain.&nbsp; Art
thou hurt?&nbsp; With whom hast thou dealt?&nbsp; Where be
they?&nbsp; Whence comest thou?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay, I am not hurt,&rsquo; said Face-of-god.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Stint thy questions then, till thou hast told me whom thou
seekest with spear and sword and candle.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Two felons were they,&rsquo; said Hall-face,
&lsquo;even such as ye saw lying dead at Wood-grey&rsquo;s the
other day.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Then may ye sheathe your swords and go home,&rsquo;
said Gold-mane, &lsquo;for one lieth at the bottom of the eddy,
and the other, thy feet are well-nigh treading on him,
Hall-face.&rsquo;
Then arose a rumour of praise and victory, and they brought
the torches nigh and looked at the fallen man, and found that he
was stark dead; so they even let him lie there till the morrow,
and all turned about toward the Thorp; and many looked on
Face-of-god and wondered concerning him, whence he was and what
had befallen him.&nbsp; Indeed, they would have asked him
thereof, but could not get at him to ask; but whoso could, went
as nigh to Hall-face and him as they might, to hearken to the
talk between the brothers.
So as they went along Hall-face did verily ask him whence he
came: &lsquo;For was it not so,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that thou
didst enter into the wood seeking some adventure early in the
morning the day before yesterday?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Sooth is that,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;and I
came to Shadowy Vale, and thence am I come this
morning.&rsquo;
Said Hall-face: &lsquo;I know not Shadowy Vale, nor doth any
of us.&nbsp; This is a new word.&nbsp; How say ye, friends, doth
any man here know of Shadowy Vale?&rsquo;
They all said, &lsquo;Nay.&rsquo;
Then said Hall-face: &lsquo;Hast thou been amongst mere ghosts
and marvels, brother, or cometh this tale of thy
minstrelsy?&rsquo;
&lsquo;For all your words,&rsquo; said Gold-mane, &lsquo;to
that Vale have I been; and, to speak shortly (for I desire to
have your tale, and am waiting for it), I will tell thee that I
found there no marvels  span
class="pagenum">p. 157or strange wights, but a folk of
valiant men; a folk small in numbers, but great of heart; a folk
come, as we be, from the Fathers and the Gods.&nbsp; And this,
moreover, is to be said of them, that they are the foes of these
felons of whom ye were chasing these twain.&nbsp; And these same
Dusky Men of Silver-dale would slay them every man if they might;
and if we look not to it they will soon be doing the same by us;
for they are many, and as venomous as adders, as fierce as bears,
and as foul as swine.&nbsp; But these valiant men, who bear on
their banner the image of the Wolf, should be our fellows in
arms, and they have good will thereto; and they shall show us the
way to Silver-dale by blind paths, so that we may fall upon these
felons while they dwell there tormenting the poor people of the
land, and thus may we destroy them as lads a hornet&rsquo;s
nest.&nbsp; Or else the days shall be hard for us.&rsquo;
The men who hung about them drank in his words greedily.&nbsp;
But Hall-face was silent a little while, and then he said:
&lsquo;Brother Gold-mane, these be great tidings.&nbsp; Time was
when we might have deemed them but a minstrel&rsquo;s tale; for
Silver-dale we know not, of which thou speakest so glibly, nor
the Dusky Men, any more than the Shadowy Vale.&nbsp; Howbeit,
things have befallen these two last days so strange and new, that
putting them together with the murder at Wood-grey&rsquo;s, and
thy words which seem somewhat wild, it may well seem to us that
tidings unlooked for are coming our way.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Come, then,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;give me
what thou hast in thy scrip, and trust me, I shall not jeer at
thy tale.&rsquo;
Said Hall-face: &lsquo;I also will be short with the tale; and
that the more, as meseemeth it is not yet done, and that thou
thyself shalt share in the ending of it.&nbsp; It was the day
before yesterday, that is the day when thou departedst into the
woods on that adventure whereof thou shalt one day tell me more,
wilt thou not?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, in good time,&rsquo; said Face-of-god.
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; quoth Hall-face, &lsquo;we went into the
woods that day and in the morning, but after sunrise, to the
number of a score: p.
158we looked to meet a bear and a she-bear with cubs in a
certain place; for one of the Woodlanders, a keen hunter, had
told us of their lair.&nbsp; Also we were wishful to slay some of
the wild-swine, the yearlings, if we might.&nbsp; Therefore,
though we had no helms or shields or coats of fence, we had
bowshot a plenty, and good store of casting-weapons, besides our
wood-knives and an axe or so; and some of us, of whom I was one,
bore our battle-swords, as we are wont ever to do, be the foe
beast or man.
&lsquo;Thus armed we went up Wildlake&rsquo;s Way and came to
Carlstead, where half-a-score Woodlanders joined themselves to
us, so that we became a band.&nbsp; We went up the half-cleared
places past Carlstead for a mile, and then turned east into the
wood, and went I know not how far, for the Woodlanders led us by
crooked paths, but two hours wore away in our going, till we came
to the place where they looked to find the bears.&nbsp; It is a
place that may well be noted, for it is unlike the wood round
about.&nbsp; There is a close thicket some two furlongs about of
thorn and briar and ill-grown ash and oak and other trees,
planted by the birds belike; and it stands as it were in an
island amidst of a wide-spreading woodlawn of fine turf, set
about in the most goodly fashion with great tall straight-boled
oak-trees, that seem to have been planted of set purpose by
man&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Yea, dost thou know the place?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Methinks I do,&rsquo; said Gold-mane, &lsquo;and I seem
to have heard the Woodlanders give it a name and call it
Boars-bait.&rsquo;
&lsquo;That may be,&rsquo; said Hall-face.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
there we were, the dogs and the men, and we drew nigh the thicket
and beset it, and doubted not to find prey therein: but when we
would set the dogs at the thicket to enter it, they were uneasy,
and would not take up the slot, but growled and turned about this
way and that, so that we deemed that they winded some fierce
beast at our flanks or backs.
&lsquo;Even so it was, and fierce enough and deadly was the
beast; for suddenly we heard bow-strings twang, and shafts came
flying; and Iron-shield of the Upper Dale, who was close beside
me, leapt p.
159up into the air and fell down dead with an arrow
through his back.&nbsp; Then I bethought me in the twinkling of
an eye, and I cried out, &ldquo;The foe are on us! take the cover
of the tree-boles and be wary!&nbsp; For the Burg and the
Face!&nbsp; For the Burg and the Face!&rdquo;
&lsquo;So we scattered and covered ourselves with the
oak-boles, but besides Iron-shield, who was slain outright, two
goodmen were sorely hurt, to wit Bald-face, a man of our house,
and Stonyford of the Lower Dale.
&lsquo;I looked from behind my tree-bole, a great one; and far
off down the glades I saw men moving, clad in gay raiment; but
nearer to me, not a hundred yards from my cover, I saw an arm
clad in scarlet come out from behind a tree-bole, so I loosed at
it, and missed not; for straight there tottered out from behind
the tree one of those dusky foul-favoured men like to those that
were slain by Wood-grey.&nbsp; I had another shaft ready notched,
so I loosed and set the shaft in his throat, and he fell.
&lsquo;Straightway was a yelling and howling about us like the
cries of scalded curs, and the oak-wood swarmed thick with these
felons rushing on us; for it seems that the man whom I had slain
was a chief amongst them, or we judged so by his goodly
raiment.
&lsquo;Methought then our last day was come.&nbsp; What could
we do but run together again after we had loosed at a venture,
and so withstand them sword and spear in hand?&nbsp; Some fell
beneath our shot, but not many, for they came on very
swiftly.
&lsquo;So they fell on us; but for all their fierceness and
their numbers they might not break our array, and we slew four
and hurt many by sword-hewing and spear-casting and push of
spear; and five of us were hurt and one slain by their
dart-casting.&nbsp; So they drew off from us a little, and strove
to spread out and fall to shooting at us again; but this we would
not suffer, but pushed on as they fell back, keeping as close
together as we might for the trees.&nbsp; For we said that we
would all die together if needs must; and verily the stour was
hard.
&lsquo;Yet hearken!&nbsp; In that nick of time rose up a
strange cry not p.
160far from us, Ha! ha! ha! ha!&nbsp; How-ow-ow! ending
like the howl of a wolf, and then another and another and
another, till the whole wood rang again.
&lsquo;At first we deemed that here were come fresh foemen,
and that we were undone indeed; but when they heard it, the
foe-men before us faltered and gave way, and at last turned their
backs and fled, and we followed, keeping well together still:
thereby the more part of these men escaped us, for they fled
wildly here and there from those who bore that cry with them; so
we knew that our work was being done for us; therefore we stood,
and saw tall men clad in sheep-brown weed running through the
glades pursuing those felons and smiting them down, till both
fleers and pursuers passed out of our sight like men in a dream,
or as when ye roll up a pictured cloth to lay it in the
coffer.
&lsquo;But to Stone-face&rsquo;s mind those brown-clad men
were the Wights of the Wood that be of the Fathers&rsquo; blood,
and our very friends; and when some of us would yet have gone
forward and foregathered with them, and followed the chase along
with them, Stone-face gainsaid it, bidding us not to run into the
arms of a second death, when we had but just escaped from the
first.&nbsp; Sooth to say, moreover, we had divers hurt men that
needed looking to.
&lsquo;So what with one thing, what with another, we turned
back: but War-cliff&rsquo;s brother, a tall man, had felled two
of those felons with an oak sapling which he had torn from the
thicket; but he had not slain them, and by now they were just
awakening from their swoon, and were sitting up looking round
them with fierce rolling eyes, expecting the stroke, for Raven of
Longscree was standing over them with a naked war-sword in his
hand.&nbsp; But now that our blood was cool, we were loth to slay
them as they lay in our hands; so we bound them and brought them
away with us; and our own dead we carried also on such biers as
we might lightly make there, and with them three that were so
grievously hurt that they might not go afoot, these we left at
Carlstead: they were Tardy the Son of the Untamed, and Swan of
Bull-meadow, p.
161both of the Lower Dale, and a Woodlander, Undoomed to
wit.&nbsp; But the dead were Iron-shield aforesaid, and
Wool-sark, and the Hewer, a Woodlander.
&lsquo;So came we sadly at eventide to Burgstead with the two
dead Burgdalers, and the captive felons, and the wounded of us
that might go afoot; and ye may judge that they of Burgdale and
our father deemed these tidings great enough, and wotted not what
next should befall.&nbsp; Stone-face would have had those two
felons slain there and then; for no true tale could we get out of
them, nor indeed any word at all.&nbsp; But the Alderman would
not have it so; and he deemed they might serve our turn as
hostages if any of our folk should be taken: for one and all we
deemed, and still deem, that war is on us and that new folk have
gathered on our skirts.
&lsquo;So the captives were shut up in the red out-bower of
our house; and our father was minded that thou mightest tell us
somewhat of them when thou wert come home.&nbsp; But about dusk
to-day the word went that they had broken out and gotten them
weapons and fled up the Dale; and so it was.
&lsquo;But to-morrow morning will a Gate-thing be holden, and
there it will be looked for of thee that thou tell us a true tale
of thy goings.&nbsp; For it is deemed, and it is my deeming
especially, that thou may&rsquo;st tell us more of these men than
thou hast yet told us.&nbsp; Is it not so?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, surely,&rsquo; said Gold-mane, &lsquo;I can make
as many words as ye will about it; yet when all is said, it will
come to much the same tale as I have already told thee.&nbsp; Yet
belike, if ye are minded to take up the sword to defend you, I
may tell you in what wise to lay hold on the hilts.&rsquo;
&lsquo;And that is well,&rsquo; said Hall-face, &lsquo;and no
less do I look for of thee.&nbsp; But lo! here are we come to the
Gate of the Burg that abideth battle.&rsquo;
p.
162CHAPTER XXIII.&nbsp; TALK IN THE HALL OF THE HOUSE OF
THE FACE.
In sooth they were come to the very
Gate of Burgstead, and the great gates were shut, and only a
wicket was open, and a half score of stout men in all their
war-gear were holding ward thereby.&nbsp; They gave place to
Hall-face and his company, albeit some of the warders followed
them through the wicket that they might hear the story told.
The street was full of folk, both men and women, talking
together eagerly concerning all these tidings, and when they saw
the men of the Hue-and-cry they came thronging about them, so
that they might scarce get to the door of the House of the Face
because of the press; so Hall-face (who was a very tall man)
cried out:
&lsquo;Good people, all is well! the runaways are slain, and
Face-of-god is come back with us; give place a little, that we
may come into our house.&rsquo;
Then the throng set up a shout, and made way a little, so that
Hall-face and Gold-mane and the others could get to the
door.&nbsp; And they entered into the Hall, and saw much folk
therein; and men were sitting at table, for supper was not yet
over.&nbsp; But when they saw the new-comers they mostly rose up
from the board and stood silent to hear the tale, for they had
been talking many together each to each, so that the Hall was
full of confused noise.
So Hall-face again cried out: &lsquo;Men in this hall, good is
the tidings.&nbsp; The runaways are slain; and it was Face-of-god
who slew them as he came back safe from the waste.&rsquo;
Then they shouted for joy, and the brethren and Stone-face
with them (for he had entered with them from the street) went up
on to the da&iuml;s, while the others of the Hue-and-cry gat them
seats where they might at the endlong tables.
But when Face-of-god came up on to the da&iuml;s, there sat
Iron-face looking down on the thronged Hall with a ruddy cheerful
countenance, p.
163and beside him sat the Bride; for he had caused her to
be brought thither when he had heard of the tidings of
battle.&nbsp; She was daintily clad in a flame-coloured kirtle
embroidered with gold about the bosom and sleeves, and there was
a fillet of golden roses on her ruddy hair.&nbsp; Her eyes shone
bright and eager, and the pommels of her cheeks were flushed and
red contrary to their wont.&nbsp; Needs must Gold-mane sit by
her, and when he came close to her he knew not what to do, but he
put forth his hand to her, yet with a troubled countenance; for
he feared her grief mingled with her beauty: as for her, she
wavered in her mind whether she should forbear to touch him or
not; but she saw that men about were looking at them, and
especially was Iron-face looking on her: therefore she stood up
and took Gold-mane&rsquo;s hand and kissed his face as she had
been wont to do, and by then was her face as white as paper; and
her anguish pierced his heart, so that he well-nigh groaned for
grief of her.&nbsp; But Iron-face looked on her and said
kindly:
&lsquo;Kinswoman, thou art pale; thou hast feared for thy mate
amidst all these tidings of war, and still fearest for him.&nbsp;
But pluck up a heart; for the man is a deft warrior for all his
fair face, which thou lovest as a woman should, and his hands may
yet save his head.&nbsp; And if he be slain, yet are there other
men of the kindred, and the earth will not be a desert to thee
even then.&rsquo;
She looked at Iron-face, and the colour was come back to her
face somewhat, and she said:
&lsquo;It is true; I have feared for him; for he goeth into
perilous places.&nbsp; But for thee, thou art kind, and I thank
thee for it.&rsquo;
And therewith she kissed Iron-face and sat down in her place,
and strove to overmaster her grief, that her face might not be
changed by it; for now were thoughts of battle, and valiant hopes
arising in men&rsquo;s hearts; and it seemed to her too grievous
if she should mar that feast on the eve of battle.
But Iron-face kissed and embraced his son and said: &lsquo;Art
thou late come from the waste?&nbsp; Hast thou seen new
things?&nbsp; p.
164We look to have a notable tale from thee; though here
also have been tidings, and it is not unlike that we shall
presently have new work on our hands.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Father,&rsquo; quoth Face-of-god, &lsquo;I deem that
when thou hast heard my tale thou wilt think no less of it than
that there are valiant folk to be holpen, poor folk to be
delivered, and evil folk to be swept from off the face of the
earth.&rsquo;
&lsquo;It is well, son,&rsquo; said Iron-face.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
see that thy tale is long; let it alone for to-night.&nbsp;
To-morrow shall we hold a Gate-thing, and then shall we hear all
that thou hast to tell.&nbsp; Now eat thy meat and drink a bowl
of wine, and comfort thy troth-plight maiden.&rsquo;
So Gold-mane sat down by the Bride, and ate and drank as he
needs must; but he was ill at ease and he durst not speak to
her.&nbsp; For, on the one hand, he thought concerning his love
for the Sun-beam, and how sweet and good a thing it was that she
should take him by the hand and lead him into noble deeds and
great fame, caressing him so softly and sweetly the while; and,
on the other hand, there sat the Bride beside him, sorrowful and
angry, begrudging all that sweetness of love, as though it were
something foul and unseemly; and heavy on him lay the weight of
that grudge, for he was a man of a friendly heart.
Stone-face sat outward from him on the other side of the
Bride; and he leaned across her towards Gold-mane and said:
&lsquo;Fair shall be thy tale to-morrow, if thou tellest us
all thine adventure.&nbsp; Or wilt thou tell us less than
all?&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;In good time shalt thou know it all,
foster-father; but it is not unlike that by the time that thou
hast heard it, there shall be so many other things to tell of,
that my tale shall seem of little account to thee&mdash;even as
the saw saith that one nail driveth out the other.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said Stone-face, &lsquo;but one tale belike
shall be knit up with the others, as it fareth with the figures
that come one after other on the weaver&rsquo;s cloth; though one
maketh not the other, yet one cometh of the other.&rsquo;
p. 165Said
Face-of-god: &lsquo;Wise art thou now, foster-father, but thou
shalt be wiser yet in this matter by then a month hath worn: and
to-morrow shalt thou know enough to set thine hands
a-work.&rsquo;
So the talk fell between them; and the night wore, and the men
of Burgdale feasted in their ancient hall with merry hearts,
little weighed down by thought of the battle that might be and
the trouble to come; for they were valorous and kindly folk.
CHAPTER XXIV.&nbsp; FACE-OF-GOD GIVETH THAT TOKEN TO THE
BRIDE.
Now on the morrow, when Face-of-god
arose and other men with him, and the Hall was astir and there
was no little throng therein, the Bride came up to him; for she
had slept in the House of the Face by the bidding of the
Alderman; and she spake to him before all men, and bade him come
forth with her into the garden, because she would speak to him
apart.&nbsp; He yeasaid her, though with a heavy heart; and to
the folk about that seemed meet and due, since those twain were
deemed to be troth-plight, and they smiled kindly on them as they
went out of the Hall together.
So they came into the garden, where the pear-trees were
blossoming over the spring lilies, and the cherries were
showering their flowers on the deep green grass, and everything
smelled sweetly on the warm windless spring morning.
She led the way, going before him till they came by a smooth
grass path between the berry bushes, to a square space of grass
about which were barberry trees, their first tender leaves bright
green in the sun against the dry yellowish twigs.&nbsp; There was
a sundial amidmost of the grass, and betwixt the garden-boughs
one could see the long grey roof of the ancient hall; and sweet
familiar sounds of the nesting birds and men and women going on
their errands were all about in the scented air.&nbsp; She turned
p. 166about at
the sundial and faced Face-of-god, her hand lightly laid on the
scored brass, and spake with no anger in her voice:
&lsquo;I ask thee if thou hast brought me the token whereon
thou shalt swear to give me that gift.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said he; and therewith drew the ring from
his bosom, and held it out to her.&nbsp; She reached out her hand
to him slowly and took it, and their fingers met as she did so,
and he noted that her hand was warm and firm and wholesome as he
well remembered it.
She said: &lsquo;Whence hadst thou this fair
finger-ring?&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;My friend there in the
mountain-valley drew it from off her finger for thee, and bade me
bear thee a message.&rsquo;
Her face flushed red: &lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and
doth she send me a message?&nbsp; Then doth she know of me, and
ye have talked of me together.&nbsp; Well, give the
message!&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;She saith, that thou shalt bear in
mind, That to-morrow is a new day.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;for her it is so, and for
thee; but not for me.&nbsp; But now I have brought thee here that
thou mightest swear thine oath to me; lay thine hand on this ring
and on this brazen plate whereby the sun measures the hours of
the day for happy folk, and swear by the spring-tide of the year
and all glad things that find a mate, and by the God of the Earth
that rejoiceth in the life of man.&rsquo;
Then he laid his hand on the finger-ring as it lay on the
dial-plate and said:
&lsquo;By the spring-tide and the live things that long to
multiply their kind; by the God of the Earth that rejoiceth in
the life of man, I swear to give to my kinswoman the Bride the
second man-child that I beget; to be hers, to leave or cherish,
to love or hate, as her will may bid her.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he
looked on her soberly and said: &lsquo;It is duly sworn; is it
enough?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; she said; but he saw how the tears ran out
of her eyes and wetted the bosom of her kirtle, and she hung her
head for p.
167shame of her grief.&nbsp; And Gold-mane was all
abashed, and had no word to say; for he knew that no word of his
might comfort her; and he deemed it ill done to stay there and
behold her sorrow; and he knew not how to get him gone, and be
glad elsewhere, and leave her alone.
Then, as if she had read his thought, she looked up at him and
said smiling a little amidst of her tears:
&lsquo;I bid thee stay by me till the flood is over; for I
have yet a word to say to thee.&rsquo;
So he stood there gazing down on the grass in his turn, and
not daring to raise his eyes to her face, and the minutes seemed
long to him: till at last she said in a voice scarcely yet clear
of weeping:
&lsquo;Wilt thou say anything to me, and tell me what thou
hast done, and why, and what thou deemest will come of
it?&rsquo;
He said: &lsquo;I will tell the truth as I know it, because
thou askest it of me, and not because I would excuse myself
before thee.&nbsp; What have I done?&nbsp; Yesterday I plighted
my troth to wed the woman that I met last autumn in the
wood.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; I wot not why, but that I longed for
her.&nbsp; Yet I must tell thee that it seemed to me, and yet
seemeth, that I might do no otherwise&mdash;that there was
nothing else in the world for me to do.&nbsp; What do I deem will
come of it, sayest thou?&nbsp; This, that we shall be happy
together, she and I, till the day of our death.&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;And even so long shall I be sorry: so far are
we sundered now.&nbsp; Alas! who looked for it?&nbsp; And whither
shall I turn to now?&rsquo;
Said Gold-mane: &lsquo;She bade me tell thee that to-morrow is
a new day: meseemeth I know her meaning.&rsquo;
&lsquo;No word of hers hath any meaning to me,&rsquo; said the
Bride.
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but hast thou not heard
these rumours of war that are in the Dale?&nbsp; Shall not these
things avail thee?&nbsp; Much may grow out of them; and thou with
the mighty heart, so faithful and compassionate!&rsquo;
p. 168She
said: &lsquo;What sayest thou?&nbsp; What may grow out of
them?&nbsp; Yea, I have heard those rumours as a man sick to
death heareth men talk of their business down in the street while
he lieth on his bed; and already he hath done with it all, and
hath no world to mend or mar.&nbsp; For me nought shall grow out
of it.&nbsp; What meanest thou?&rsquo;
Said Gold-mane: &lsquo;Is there nought in the fellowship of
Folks, and the aiding of the valiant, and the deliverance of the
hapless?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;there is nought to
me.&nbsp; I cannot think of it to-day nor yet to-morrow
belike.&nbsp; Yet true it is that I may mingle in it, though
thinking nought of it.&nbsp; But this shall not avail
me.&rsquo;
She was silent a little, but presently spake and said:
&lsquo;Thou sayest right; it is not thou that hast done this, but
the woman who sent me the ring and the message of an old
saw.&nbsp; O that she should be born to sunder us!&nbsp; How hath
it befallen that I am now so little to thee and she so
much?&rsquo;
And again she was silent; and after a while Face-of-god spake
kindly and softly and said: &lsquo;Kinswoman, wilt thou for ever
begrudge our love? this grudge lieth heavy on my soul, and it is
I alone that have to bear it.&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;This is but a light burden for thee to bear,
when thou hast nought else to bear!&nbsp; But do I begrudge thee
thy love, Gold-mane?&nbsp; I know not that.&nbsp; Rather
meseemeth I do not believe in it&mdash;nor shall do
ever.&rsquo;
Then she held her peace a long while, nor did he speak one
word: and they were so still, that a robin came hopping about
them, close to the hem of her kirtle, and a starling pitched in
the apple-tree hard by and whistled and chuckled, turning about
and about, heeding them nought.&nbsp; Then at last she lifted up
her face from looking on the grass and said: &lsquo;These are
idle words and avail nothing: one thing only I know, that we are
sundered.&nbsp; And now it repenteth me that I have shown thee my
tears and my grief and my sickness of the earth and those that
dwell thereon.&nbsp; I am ashamed of it, as if thou hadst smitten
me, and I had come and  span
class="pagenum">p. 169shown thee the stripes, and said,
See what thou hast done! hast thou no pity?&nbsp; Yea, thou
pitiest me, and wilt try to forget thy pity.&nbsp; Belike thou
art right when thou sayest, To-morrow is a new day; belike
matters will arise that will call me back to life, and I shall
once more take heed of the joy and sorrow of my people.&nbsp;
Nay, it is most like that this I shall feign to do even
now.&nbsp; But if to-morrow be a new day, it is to-day now and
not to-morrow, and so shall it be for long.&nbsp; Hereof belike
we shall talk no more, thou and I.&nbsp; For as the days wear,
the dealings between us shall be that thou shalt but get thee
away from my life, and I shall be nought to thee but the name of
a kinswoman.&nbsp; Thus should it be even wert thou to strive to
make it otherwise; and thou shalt not strive.&nbsp; So let
all this be; for this is not the word I had to say to thee.&nbsp;
But hearken! now are we sundered, and it irketh me beyond measure
that folk know it not, and are kind, and rejoice in our love, and
deem it a happy thing for the folk; and this burden I may bear no
longer.&nbsp; So I shall declare unto men that I will not wed
thee; and belike they may wonder why it is, till they see thee
wedded to the Woman of the Mountain.&nbsp; Art thou content that
so it shall be?&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;Nay, thou shalt not take this all
upon thyself; I also shall declare unto the Folk that I will wed
none but her, the Mountain-Woman.&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;This shalt thou not do; I forbid it
thee.&nbsp; And I will take it all upon myself.&nbsp;
Shall I have it said of me that I am unmeet to wed thee, and that
thou hast found me out at last and at latest?&nbsp; I lay this
upon thee, that wheresoever I declare this and whatsoever I may
say, thou shalt hold thy peace.&nbsp; This at least thou
may&rsquo;st do for me.&nbsp; Wilt thou?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;though it shall put me to
shame.&rsquo;
Again she was silent for a little; then she said:
&lsquo;O Gold-mane, this would I take upon myself not soothly
for any shame of seeming to be thy cast-off; but because it is I
who needs must bear all the sorrow of our sundering; and I have
the p. 170will
to bear it greater and heavier, that I may be as the women of old
time, and they that have come from the Gods, lest I belittle my
life with malice and spite and confusion, and it become poisonous
to me.&nbsp; Be at peace! be at peace!&nbsp; And leave all to the
wearing of the years; and forget not that which thou hast
sworn!&rsquo;
Therewith she turned and went from that green place toward the
House of the Face, walking slowly through the garden amongst the
sweet odours, beneath the fair blossoms, a body most dainty and
beauteous of fashion, but the casket of grievous sorrow, which
all that goodliness availed not.
But Face-of-god lingered in that place a little, and for that
little while the joy of his life was dulled and overworn; and the
days before his wandering on the mountain seemed to him free and
careless and happy days that he could not but regret.&nbsp; He
was ashamed, moreover, that this so unquenchable grief should
come but of him, and the pleasure of his life, which he himself
had found out for himself, and which was but such a little
portion of the Earth and the deeds thereof.&nbsp; But presently
his thought wandered from all this, and as he turned away from
the sundial and went his ways through the garden, he called to
mind his longing for the day of the spring market, when he should
see the Sun-beam again and be cherished by the sweetness of her
love.
CHAPTER XXV.&nbsp; OF THE GATE-THING AT BURGSTEAD.
But now must he hasten, for the
Gate-thing was to be holden two hours before noon; so he betook
him speedily to the Hall, and took his shield and did on a goodly
helm and girt his sword to his side, for men must needs go to all
folk-motes with their weapons and clad in war-gear.&nbsp; Thus he
went forth to the Gate with many others, and there already were
many folk assembled in the space aforesaid betwixt the Gate of
the Burg and the sheer rocks on the face of which were the steps
that led p.
171up to the ancient Tower on the height.&nbsp; The
Alderman was sitting on the great stone by the Gate-side which
was his appointed place, and beside him on the stone bench were
the six Wardens of the Burg; but of the six Wardens of the Dale
there were but three, for the others had not yet heard tell of
the battle or had got the summons to the Thing, since they had
been about their business down the Dale.
Face-of-god took his place silently amongst the neighbours,
but men made way for him, so that he must needs stand in front,
facing his father and the Wardens; and there went up a murmur of
expectation round about him, both because the word had gone about
that he had a tale of new tidings to tell, and also because men
deemed him their best and handiest man, though he was yet so
young.
Now the Alderman looked around and beheld a great throng
gathered together, and he looked on the shadow of the Gate which
the southering sun was casting on the hard white ground of the
Thing-stead, and he saw that it had just taken in the
standing-stone which was in the midst of the place.&nbsp; On the
face of the said stone was carven the image of a fighting man
with shield on arm and axe in hand; for it had been set there in
old time in memory of the man who had bidden the Folk build the
Gate and its wall, and had showed them how to fashion it: for he
was a deft house-smith as well as a great warrior; and his name
was Iron-hand.&nbsp; So when the Alderman saw that this stone was
wholly within the shadow of the Gate he knew that it was the due
time for the hallowing-in of the Thing.&nbsp; So he bade one of
the wardens who sat beside him and had a great slug-horn slung
about him, to rise and set the horn to his mouth.
So that man arose and blew three great blasts that went
bellowing about the towers and down the street, and beat back
again from the face of the sheer rocks and up them and over into
the wild-wood; and the sound of it went on the light west-wind
along the lips of the Dale toward the mountain wastes.&nbsp; And
many a p.
172goodman, when he heard the voice of the horn in the
bright spring morning, left spade or axe or plough-stilts, or the
foddering of the ewes and their younglings, and turned back home
to fetch his sword and helm and hasten to the Thing, though he
knew not why it was summoned: and women wending over the meadows,
who had not yet heard of the battle in the wood, hearkened and
stood still on the green grass or amidst the ripples of the ford,
and the threat of coming trouble smote heavy on their hearts, for
they knew that great tidings must be towards if a Thing must
needs be summoned so close to the Great Folk-mote.
But now the Alderman stood up and spake amidst the silence
that followed the last echoes of the horn:
&lsquo;Now is hallowed in this Gate-thing of the Burgstead Men
and the Men of the Dale, wherein they shall take counsel
concerning matters late befallen, that press hard upon
them.&nbsp; Let no man break the peace of the Holy Thing, lest he
become a man accursed in holy places from the plain up to the
mountain, and from the mountain down to the plain; a man not to
be cherished of any man of good will, not be holpen with victuals
or edge-tool or draught-beast; a man to be sheltered under no
roof-tree, and warmed at no hearth of man: so help us the Warrior
and the God of the Earth, and Him of the Face, and all the
Fathers!&rsquo;
When he had spoken men clashed their weapons in token of
assent; and he sat down again, and there was silence for a
space.&nbsp; But presently came thrusting forward a goodman of
the Dale, who seemed as if he had come hurriedly to the Thing;
for his face was running down with sweat, his wide-rimmed iron
cap sat awry over his brow, and he was girt with a rusty sword
without a scabbard, and the girdle was ill-braced up about his
loins.&nbsp; So he said:
&lsquo;I am Red-coat of Waterless of the Lower Dale.&nbsp;
Early this morning as I was going afield I met on the way a man
akin to me, Fox of Upton to wit, and he told me that men were
being summoned to a Gate-thing.&nbsp; So I turned back home, and
caught up p.
173any weapon that came handy, and here I am, Alderman,
asking thee of the tidings which hath driven thee to call this
Thing so hard on the Great Folk-mote, for I know them nothing
so.&rsquo;
Then stood up Iron-face the Alderman and said: &lsquo;This is
well asked, and soon shall ye be as wise as I am on this
matter.&nbsp; Know ye, O men of Burgstead and the Dale, that we
had not called this Gate-thing so hard on the Great Folk-mote had
not great need been to look into troublous matters.&nbsp; Long
have ye dwelt in peace, and it is years on years now since any
foeman hath fallen on the Dale: but, as ye will bear in mind,
last autumn were there ransackings in the Dale and amidst of the
Shepherds after the manner of deeds of war; and it troubleth us
that none can say who wrought these ill deeds.&nbsp; Next, but a
little while agone, was Wood-grey, a valiant goodman of the
Woodlanders, slain close to his own door by evil men.&nbsp; These
men we took at first for mere gangrel felons and outcasts from
their own folk: though there were some who spoke against that
from the beginning.
&lsquo;But thirdly are new tidings again: for three days ago,
while some of the folk were hunting peaceably in the Wild-wood
and thinking no evil, they were fallen upon of set purpose by a
host of men-at-arms, and nought would serve but mere battle for
dear life, so that many of our neighbours were hurt, and three
slain outright; and now mark this, that those who there fell upon
our folk were clad and armed even as the two felons that slew
Wood-grey, and moreover were like them in aspect of body.&nbsp;
Now stand forth Hall-face my son, and answer to my questions in a
loud voice, so that all may hear thee.&rsquo;
So Hall-face stood forth, clad in gleaming war-gear, with an
axe over his shoulder, and seemed a doughty warrior.&nbsp; And
Iron-face said to him:
&lsquo;Tell me, son, those whom ye met in the wood, and of
whom ye brought home two captives, how much like were they to the
murder-carles at Wood-grey&rsquo;s?&rsquo;
Said Hall-face: &lsquo;As like as peas out of the same cod,
and to p.
174our eyes all those whom we saw in the wood might have
been sons of one father and one mother, so much alike were
they.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said the Alderman; &lsquo;now tell me how
many by thy deeming fell upon you in the wood?&rsquo;
Said Hall-face: &lsquo;We deemed that if they were any less
than threescore, they were little less.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Great was the odds,&rsquo; said the Alderman.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Or how many were ye?&rsquo;
&lsquo;One score and seven,&rsquo; said Hall-face.
Said the Alderman: &lsquo;And yet ye escaped with life all
save those three?&rsquo;
Hall-face said: &lsquo;I deem that scarce one should have come
back alive, had it not been that as we fought came a noise like
the howling of wolves, and thereat the foemen turned and fled,
and there followed on the fleers tall men clad in sheep-brown
raiment, who smote them down as they fled.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Here then is the story, neighbours,&rsquo; said the
Alderman, &lsquo;and ye may see thereby that if those slayers of
Wood-grey were outcast, their band is a great one; but it seemeth
rather that they were men of a folk whose craft it is to rob with
the armed hand, and to slay the robbed; and that they are now
gathering on our borders for war.&nbsp; Yet, moreover, they have
foemen in the woods who should be fellows-in-arms of us.&nbsp;
How sayest thou, Stone-face?&nbsp; Thou art old, and hast seen
many wars in the Dale, and knowest the Wild-wood to its
innermost.
&lsquo;Alderman,&rsquo; said Stone-face, &lsquo;and ye
neighbours of the Dale, maybe these foes whom ye have met are not
of the race of man, but are trolls and wood-wights.&nbsp; Now if
they be trolls it is ill, for then is the world growing worser,
and the wood shall be right perilous for those who needs must
fare therein.&nbsp; Yet if they be men it is a worse matter; for
the trolls would not come out of the waste into the sunlight of
the Dale.&nbsp; But these foes, if they be men, are lusting after
our fair Dale to eat it up, and it is most like that they are
gathering a huge host to fall upon us at home.&nbsp;  a
name="page175">p. 175Such things
I have heard of when I was young, and the aspect of the evil men
who overran the kindreds of old time, according to all tales and
lays that I have heard, is even such as the aspect of those whom
we have seen of late.&nbsp; As to those wolves who saved the
neighbours and chased their foemen, there is one here who belike
knoweth more of all this than we do, and that, O Alderman, is thy
son whom I have fostered, Face-of-god to wit.&nbsp; Bid him
answer to thy questioning, and tell us what he hath seen and
heard of late; then shall we verily know the whole story as far
as it can be known.&rsquo;
Then men pressed round, and were eager to hear what
Face-of-god would be saying.&nbsp; But or ever the Alderman could
begin to question him, the throng was cloven by new-comers, and
these were the men who had been sent to bring home the corpses of
the Dusky Men: so they had cast loaded hooks into the Weltering
Water, and had dragged up him whom Face-of-god had shoved into
the eddy, and who had sunk like a stone just where he fell, and
now they were bringing him on a bier along with him who had been
slain a-land.&nbsp; They were set down in the place before the
Alderman, and men who had not seen them before looked eagerly on
them that they might behold the aspect of their foemen; and
nought lovely were they to look on; for the drowned man was
already bleached and swollen with the water, and the other, his
face was all wryed and twisted with that spear-thrust in the
mouth.
Then the Alderman said: &lsquo;I would question my son
Face-of-god.&nbsp; Let him stand forth!&rsquo;
And therewith he smiled merrily in his son&rsquo;s face, for
he was standing right in front of him; and he said:
&lsquo;Ask of me, Alderman, and I will answer.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Kinsman,&rsquo; said Iron-face, &lsquo;look at these
two dead men, and tell me, if thou hast seen any such besides
those two murder-carles who were slain at Carlstead; or if thou
knowest aught of their folk?&rsquo;
p. 176Said
Face-of-god: &lsquo;Yesterday I saw six others like to these both
in array and of body, and three of them I slew, for we were in
battle with them early in the morning.&rsquo;
There was a murmur of joy at this word, since all men took
these felons for deadly foemen; but Iron-face said: &lsquo;What
meanest thou by &ldquo;we&rdquo;?&rsquo;
&lsquo;I and the men who had guested me overnight,&rsquo; said
Face-of-god, &lsquo;and they slew the other three; or rather a
woman of them slew the felons.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Valiant she was; all good go with her hand!&rsquo; said
the Alderman.&nbsp; &lsquo;But what be these people, and where do
they dwell?&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;As to what they are, they are of the
kindred of the Gods and the Fathers, valiant men, and
guest-cherishing: rich have they been, and now are poor: and
their poverty cometh of these same felons, who mastered them by
numbers not to be withstood.&nbsp; As to where they dwell: when I
say the name of their dwelling-place men mock at me, as if I
named some valley in the moon: yet came I to Burgdale thence in
one day across the mountain-necks led by sure guides, and I tell
thee that the name of their abode is Shadowy Vale.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said Iron-face, &lsquo;knoweth any man here
of Shadowy Vale, or where it is?&rsquo;
None answered for a while; but there was an old man who was
sitting on the shafts of a wain on the outskirts of the throng,
and when he heard this word he asked his neighbour what the
Alderman was saying, and he told him.&nbsp; Then said that
elder:
&lsquo;Give me place; for I have a word to say
hereon.&rsquo;&nbsp; Therewith he arose, and made his way to the
front of the ring of men, and said: &lsquo;Alderman, thou knowest
me?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said Iron-face, &lsquo;thou art called the
Fiddle, because of thy sweet speech and thy minstrelsy; whereof I
mind me well in the time when I was young and thou no longer
young.&rsquo;
&lsquo;So it is,&rsquo; said the Fiddle.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now
hearken!&nbsp; When I was very young I heard of a vale lying far
away across the mountain-necks;  span
class="pagenum">p. 177a vale where the sun shone never in
winter and scantily in summer; for my sworn foster-brother,
Fight-fain, a bold man and a great hunter, had happened upon it;
and on a day in full midsummer he brought me thither; and even
now I see the Vale before me as in a picture; a marvellous place,
well grassed, treeless, narrow, betwixt great cliff-walls of
black stone, with a green river running through it towards a
yawning gap and a huge force.&nbsp; Amidst that Vale was a
doom-ring of black stones, and nigh thereto a feast-hall well
builded of the like stones, over whose door was carven the image
of a wolf with red gaping jaws, and within it (for we entered
into it) were stone benches on the da&iuml;s.&nbsp; Thence we
came away, and thither again we went in late autumn, and so dusk
and cold it was at that season, that we knew not what to call it
save the valley of deep shade.&nbsp; But its real name we never
knew; for there was no man there to give us a name or tell us any
tale thereof; but all was waste there; the wimbrel laughed across
its water, the raven croaked from its crags, the eagle screamed
over it, and the voices of its waters never ceased; and thus we
left it.&nbsp; So the seasons passed, and we went thither no
more: for Fight-fain died, and without him wandering over the
waste was irksome to me; so never have I seen that valley again,
or heard men tell thereof.
&lsquo;Now, neighbours, have I told you of a valley which
seemeth to be Shadowy Vale; and this is true and no made-up
story.&rsquo;
The Alderman nodded kindly to him, and then said to
Face-of-god: &lsquo;Kinsman, is this word according with what
thou knowest of Shadowy Vale?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, on all points,&rsquo; said Face-of-god; &lsquo;he
hath put before me a picture of the valley.&nbsp; And whereas he
saith, that in his youth it was waste, this also goeth with my
knowledge thereof.&nbsp; For once was it peopled, and then was
waste, and now again is it peopled.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Tell us then more of the folk thereof,&rsquo; said the
Alderman; &lsquo;are they many?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;they are
not.&nbsp; How might they be  span
class="pagenum">p. 178many, dwelling in that narrow Vale
amid the wastes?&nbsp; But they are valiant, both men and women,
and strong and well-liking.&nbsp; Once they dwelt in a fair dale
called Silver-dale, the name whereof will be to you as a name in
a lay; and there were they wealthy and happy.&nbsp; Then fell
upon them this murderous Folk, whom they call the Dusky Men; and
they fought and were overcome, and many of them were slain, and
many enthralled, and the remnant of them escaped through the
passes of the mountains and came back to dwell in Shadowy Vale,
where their forefathers had dwelt long and long ago; and this
overthrow befell them ten years agone.&nbsp; But now their old
foemen have broken out from Silver-dale and have taken to
scouring the wood seeking prey; so they fall upon these Dusky Men
as occasion serves, and slay them without pity, as if they were
adders or evil dragons; and indeed they be worse.&nbsp; And these
valiant men know for certain that their foemen are now of mind to
fall upon this Dale and destroy it, as they have done with others
nigher to them.&nbsp; And they will slay our men, and lie with
our women against their will, and enthrall our children, and
torment all those that lie under their hands till life shall be
worse than death to them.&nbsp; Therefore, O Alderman and
Wardens, and ye neighbours all, it behoveth you to take counsel
what we shall do, and that speedily.&rsquo;
There was again a murmur, as of men nothing daunted, but
intent on taking some way through the coming trouble.&nbsp; But
no man said aught till the Alderman spake:
&lsquo;When didst thou first happen upon this Earl-folk,
son?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Late last autumn,&rsquo; said Face-of-god.
Said Iron-face: &lsquo;Then mightest thou have told us of this
tale before.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said his son, &lsquo;but I knew it not, or
but little of it, till two days agone.&nbsp; In the autumn I
wandered in the woodland, and on the fell I happened on a few of
this folk dwelling in a booth by the pine-wood; and they were
kind and guest-fain with me, and gave me meat and drink and
lodging, and bade me come to  span
class="pagenum">p. 179Shadowy Vale in the spring, when I
should know more of them.&nbsp; And that was I fain of; for they
are wise and goodly men.&nbsp; But I deemed no more of those that
I saw there save as men who had been outlawed by their own folk
for deeds that were unlawful belike, but not shameful, and were
biding their time of return, and were living as they might
meanwhile.&nbsp; But of the whole Folk and their foemen knew I no
more than ye did, till two days agone, when I met them again in
Shadowy Vale.&nbsp; Also I think before long ye shall see their
chieftain in Burgstead, for he hath a word for us.&nbsp; Lastly,
my mind it is that those brown-clad men who helped Hall-face and
his company in the wood were nought but men of this Earl-kin
seeking their foemen; for indeed they told me that they had come
upon a battle in the woodland wherein they had slain their
foemen.&nbsp; Now have I told you all that ye need to know
concerning these matters.&rsquo;
Again was there silence as Iron-face sat pondering a question
for his son; then a goodman of the Upper Dale, Gritgarth to wit,
spake and said:
&lsquo;Gold-mane mine, tell us how many is this folk; I mean
their fighting-men?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Well asked, neighbour,&rsquo; said Iron-face.
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;Their fighting-men of full age may be
five score; but besides that there shall be some two or three
score of women that will fight, whoever says them nay; and many
of these are little worse in the field than men; or no worse, for
they shoot well in the bow.&nbsp; Moreover, there will be a full
score of swains not yet twenty winters old whom ye may not hinder
to fight if anything is a-doing.&rsquo;
&lsquo;This is no great host,&rsquo; said the Alderman;
&lsquo;yet if they deem there is little to lose by fighting, and
nought to gain by sitting still, they may go far in winning their
desire; and that more especially if they may draw into their
quarrel some other valiant Folk more in number than they
be.&nbsp; I marvel not, though, they were kind to thee, son
Gold-mane, if they knew who thou wert.&rsquo;
p.
180&lsquo;They knew it,&rsquo; said Face-of-god.
&lsquo;Neighbours,&rsquo; said the Alderman, &lsquo;have ye
any rede hereon, and aught to say to back your rede?&rsquo;
Then spake the Fiddle: &lsquo;As ye know and may see, I am now
very old, and, as the word goes, unmeet for battle: yet might I
get me to the field, either on mine own legs or on the legs of
some four-foot beast, I would strike, if it were but one stroke,
on these pests of the earth.&nbsp; And, Alderman, meseemeth we
shall do amiss if we bid not the Earl-folk of Shadowy Vale to be
our fellows in arms in this adventure.&nbsp; For look you, how
few soever they be, they will be sure to know the ways of our
foemen, and the mountain passes, and the surest and nighest roads
across the necks and the mires of the waste; and though they be
not a host, yet shall they be worth a host to us?&rsquo;
When men heard his words they shouted for joy of them; for
hatred of the Dusky Men who should so mar their happy life in the
Dale was growing up in them, and the more that hatred waxed, the
more waxed their love of those valiant ones.
Now Red-coat of Waterless spake again: he was a big man, both
tall and broad, ruddy-faced and red-haired, some forty winters
old.&nbsp; He said:
&lsquo;Life hath been well with us of the Lower Dale, and we
deem that we have much to lose in losing it.&nbsp; Yet ill would
the bargain be to buy life with thralldom: we have been
over-merry hitherto for that.&nbsp; Therefore I say, to
battle!&nbsp; And as to these men, these well-wishers of
Face-of-god, if they also are minded for battle with our foes, we
were fools indeed if we did not join them to our company, were
they but one score instead of six.&rsquo;
Men shouted again, and they said that Red-coat had spoken
well.&nbsp; Then one after other the goodmen of the Dale came and
gave their word for fellowship in arms with the Men of Shadowy
Vale, if there were such as Face-of-god had said, which they
doubted not; and amongst them that spake were Fox of Nethertown,
and Warwell, and Gritgarth, and Bearswain, and Warcliff, and  a
name="page181">p. 181Hart of
Highcliff, and Worm of Willowholm, and Bullsbane, and Highneb of
the Marsh: all these were stout men-at-arms and men of good
counsel.
Last of all the Alderman spake and said:
&lsquo;As to the war, that must we needs meet if all be sooth
that we have heard, and I doubt it not.
&lsquo;Now therefore let us look to it like wise men while
time yet serves.&nbsp; Ye shall know that the muster of the
Dalesmen will bring under shield eight long hundreds of men
well-armed, and of the Shepherd-Folk four hundreds, and of the
Woodlanders two hundreds; and this is a goodly host if it be well
ordered and wisely led.&nbsp; Now am I your Alderman and your
Doomster, and I can heave up a sword as well as another maybe,
nor do I think that I shall blench in the battle; yet I misdoubt
me that I am no leader or orderer of men-of-war: therefore ye
will do wisely to choose a wiser man-at-arms than I be for your
War-leader; and if at the Great Folk-mote, when all the Houses
and Kindreds are gathered, men yeasay your choosing, then let him
abide; but if they naysay it, let him give place to
another.&nbsp; For time presses.&nbsp; Will ye so
choose?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, yea!&rsquo; cried all men.
&lsquo;Good is that, neighbours,&rsquo; said the
Alderman.&nbsp; &lsquo;Whom will ye have for War-leader?&nbsp;
Consider well.&rsquo;
Short was their rede, for every man opened his mouth and cried
out &lsquo;Face-of-god!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then said the Alderman:
&lsquo;The man is young and untried; yet though he is so near
akin to me, I will say that ye will do wisely to take him; for he
is both deft of his hands and brisk; and moreover, of this matter
he knoweth more than all we together.&nbsp; Now therefore I
declare him your War-leader till the time of the Great
Folk-mote.&rsquo;
Then all men shouted with great glee and clashed their
weapons; but some few put their heads together and spake apart a
little while, and then one of them, Red-coat of Waterless to wit,
came forward and said: &lsquo;Alderman, some of us deem it good
that p.
182Stone-face, the old man wise in war and in the ways of
the Wood, should be named as a counsellor to the War-leader; and
Hall-face, a very brisk and strong young man, to be his right
hand and sword-bearer.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Good is that,&rsquo; said Iron-face.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Neighbours, will ye have it so?&rsquo;&nbsp; This also
they yeasaid without delay, and the Alderman declared Stone-face
and Hall-face the helpers of Face-of-god in this business.&nbsp;
Then he said:
&lsquo;If any hath aught to say concerning what is best to be
done at once, it were good that he said it now before all and not
to murmur and grudge hereafter.&rsquo;
None spake save the Fiddle, who said: &lsquo;Alderman and
War-leader, one thing would I say: that if these foemen are
anywise akin to those overrunners of the Folks of whom the tales
went in my youth (for I also as well as Stone-face mind me well
of those tales concerning them), it shall not avail us to sit
still and await their onset.&nbsp; For then may they not be
withstood, when they have gathered head and burst out and over
the folk that have been happy, even as the waters that overtop a
dyke and cover with their muddy ruin the deep green grass and the
flower-buds of spring.&nbsp; Therefore my rede is, as soon as may
be to go seek these folk in the woodland and wheresoever else
they may be wandering.&nbsp; What sayest thou,
Face-of-god?&rsquo;
&lsquo;My rede is as thine,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;and to
begin with, I do now call upon ten tens of good men to meet me in
arms at the beginning of Wildlake&rsquo;s Way to-morrow morning
at daybreak; and I bid my brother Hall-face to summon such as are
most meet thereto.&nbsp; For this I deem good, that we scour the
wood daily at present till we hear fresh tidings from them of
Shadowy Vale, who are nigher than we to the foemen.&nbsp; Now,
neighbours, are ye ready to meet me?&rsquo;
Then all shouted, &lsquo;Yea, we will go, we will
go!&rsquo;
Said the Alderman: &lsquo;Now have we made provision for the
war in that which is nearest to our hands.&nbsp; Yet have we to
deal with p.
183the matter of the fellowship with the Folk whom
Face-of-god hath seen.&nbsp; This is a matter for thee, son, at
least till the Great Folk-mote is holden.&nbsp; Tell me then,
shall we send a messenger to Shadowy Vale to speak with this
folk, or shall we abide the chieftain&rsquo;s coming?&rsquo;
&lsquo;By my rede,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;we shall
abide his coming: for first, though I might well make my way
thither, I doubt if I could give any the bearings, so that he
could come there without me; and belike I am needed at home,
since I am become War-leader.&nbsp; Moreover, when your messenger
cometh to Shadowy Vale, he may well chance to find neither the
chieftain there, nor the best of his men; for whiles are they
here, and whiles there, as they wend following after the Dusky
Men.&rsquo;
&lsquo;It is well, son,&rsquo; said the Alderman, &lsquo;let
it be as thou sayest: soothly this matter must needs be brought
before the Great Folk-mote.&nbsp; Now will I ask if any other
hath any word to say, or any rede to give before this Gate-thing
sundereth?&rsquo;
But no man came forward, and all men seemed well content and
of good heart; and it was now well past noontide.
CHAPTER XXVI.&nbsp; THE ENDING OF THE GATE-THING.
But just as the Alderman was on the
point of rising to declare the breaking-up of the Thing, there
came a stir in the throng and it opened, and a warrior came forth
into the innermost of the ring of men, arrayed in goodly
glittering War-gear; clad in such wise that a tunicle of precious
gold-wrought web covered the hauberk all but the sleeves thereof,
and the hem of it beset with blue mountain-stones smote against
the ankles and well-nigh touched the feet, shod with sandals
gold-embroidered and gemmed.&nbsp; This warrior bore a goodly
gilded helm on the head, and held in hand a spear with
gold-garlanded shaft, and was girt with a sword whose hilts and
scabbard both were adorned with gold and gems: beardless,  a
name="page184">p.
184smooth-cheeked, exceeding fair of face was the warrior,
but pale and somewhat haggard-eyed: and those who were nearby
beheld and wondered; for they saw that there was come the Bride
arrayed for war and battle, as if she were a messenger from the
House of the Gods, and the Burg that endureth for ever.
Then she fell to speech in a voice which at first was somewhat
hoarse and broken, but cleared as she went on, and she said:
&lsquo;There sittest thou, O Alderman of Burgdale!&nbsp; Is
Face-of-god thy son anywhere nigh, so that he can hear
me?&rsquo;
But Iron-face wondered at her word, and said: &lsquo;He is
beside thee, as he should be.&rsquo;&nbsp; For indeed Face-of-god
was touching her, shoulder to shoulder.&nbsp; But she looked not
to the right hand nor the left, but said:
&lsquo;Hearken, Iron-face!&nbsp; Chief of the House of the
Face, Alderman of the Dale, and ye also, neighbours and goodmen
of the Dale: I am a woman called the Bride, of the House of the
Steer, and ye have heard that I have plighted my troth to
Face-of-god to wed with him, to love him, and lie in his
bed.&nbsp; But it is not so: we are not troth-plight; nor will I
wed with him, nor any other, but will wend with you to the war,
and play my part therein according to what might is in me; nor
will I be worser than the wives of Shadowy Vale.&rsquo;
Face-of-god heard her words with no change of countenance; but
Iron-face reddened over all his face, and stared at her, and knit
his brows and said:
&lsquo;Maiden, what are these words?&nbsp; What have we done
to thee?&nbsp; Have I not been to thee as a father, and loved
thee dearly?&nbsp; Is not my son goodly and manly and deft in
arms?&nbsp; Hath it not ever been the wont of the House of the
Face to wed in the House of the Steer? and in these two Houses
there hath never yet been a goodlier man and a lovelier maiden
than are ye two.&nbsp; What have we done then?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Ye have done nought against me,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;and all that thou sayest is sooth; yet will I not wed with
Face-of-god.&rsquo;
p. 185Yet
fiercer waxed the face of the Alderman, and he said in a loud
voice:
&lsquo;But how if I tell thee that I will speak with thy
kindred of the Steer, and thou shalt do after my bidding whether
thou wilt or whether thou wilt not?&rsquo;
&lsquo;And how will ye compel me thereto?&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are there thralls in the Dale?&nbsp; Or will
ye make me an outlaw?&nbsp; Who shall heed it?&nbsp; Or I shall
betake me to Shadowy Vale and become one of their
warrior-maidens.&rsquo;
Now was the Alderman&rsquo;s face changing from red to white,
and belike he forgat the Thing, and what he was doing there, and
he cried out:
&lsquo;This is an evil day, and who shall help me?&nbsp; Thou,
Face-of-god, what hast thou to say?&nbsp; Wilt thou let this
woman go without a word?&nbsp; What hath bewitched
thee?&rsquo;
But never a word spake his son, but stood looking straight
forward, cold and calm by seeming.&nbsp; Then turned Iron-face
again to the Bride, and said in a softer voice:
&lsquo;Tell me, maiden, whom I erst called daughter, what hath
befallen, that thou wilt leave my son; thou who wert once so kind
and loving to him; whose hand was always seeking his, whose eyes
were ever following his; who wouldst go where he bade, and come
when he called.&nbsp; What hath betid that ye have cast him out,
and flee from our House?&rsquo;
She flushed red beneath her helm and said:
&lsquo;There is war in the land, and I have seen it coming,
and that things shall change around us.&nbsp; I have looked about
me and seen men happy and women content, and children weary for
mere mirth and joy.&nbsp; And I have thought, in a day, or two
days or three, all this shall be changed, and the women shall be,
some anxious and wearied with waiting, some casting all hope
away; and the men, some shall come back to the garth no more, and
some shall come back maimed and useless, and there shall be loss
of friends and fellows, and mirth departed, and dull days and
empty hours, p.
186and the children wandering about marvelling at the
sorrow of the house.&nbsp; All this I saw before me, and grief
and pain and wounding and death; and I said: Shall I be any
better than the worst of the folk that loveth me?&nbsp; Nay, this
shall never be; and since I have learned to be deft with mine
hands in all the play of war, and that I am as strong as many a
man, and as hardy-hearted as any, I will give myself to the
Warrior and the God of the Face; and the battle-field shall be my
home, and the after-grief of the fight my banquet and holiday,
that I may bear the burden of my people, in the battle and out of
it; and know every sorrow that the Dale hath; and cast aside as a
grievous and ugly thing the bed of the warrior that the maiden
desires, and the toying of lips and hands and soft words of
desire, and all the joy that dwelleth in the Castle of Love and
the Garden thereof; while the world outside is sick and sorry,
and the fields lie waste and the harvest burneth.&nbsp; Even so
have I sworn, even so will I do.&rsquo;
Her eyes glittered and her cheek was flushed, and her voice
was clear and ringing now; and when she ended there arose a
murmur of praise from the men round about her.&nbsp; But
Iron-face said coldly:
&lsquo;These are great words; but I know not what they
mean.&nbsp; If thou wilt to the field and fight among the carles
(and that I would not naysay, for it hath oft been done and
praised aforetime), why shouldest thou not go side by side with
Face-of-god and as his plighted maiden?&rsquo;
The light which the sweetness of speech had brought into her
face had died out of it now, and she looked weary and hapless as
she answered him slowly:
&lsquo;I will not wed with Face-of-god, but will fare afield
as a virgin of war, as I have sworn to the Warrior.&rsquo;
Then waxed Iron-face exceeding wroth, and he rose up before
all men and cried loudly and fiercely:
&lsquo;There is some lie abroad, that windeth about us as the
gossamers in the lanes of an autumn morning.&rsquo;
And therewith he strode up to Face-of-god as though he had  a
name="page187">p. 187nought to
do with the Thing; and he stood before him and cried out at him
while all men wondered:
&lsquo;Thou! what hast thou done to turn this maiden&rsquo;s
heart to stone?&nbsp; Who is it that is devising guile with thee
to throw aside this worthy wedding in a worthy House, with whom
our sons are ever wont to wed?&nbsp; Speak, tell the
tale!&rsquo;
But Face-of-god held his peace and stood calm and proud before
all men.
Then the blood mounted to Iron-face&rsquo;s head, and he
forgat folk and kindred and the war to come, and he cried so that
all the place rang with the words of his anger:
&lsquo;Thou dastard!&nbsp; I see thee now; it is thou that
hast done this, and not the maiden; and now thou hast made her
bear a double burden, and set her on to speak for thee, whilst
thou standest by saying nought, and wilt take no scruple&rsquo;s
weight of her shame upon thee!&rsquo;
But his son spake never a word, and Iron-face cried:
&lsquo;Out on thee!&nbsp; I know thee now, and why thou wouldest
not to the West-land last winter.&nbsp; I am no fool; I know
thee.&nbsp; Where hast thou hidden the stranger woman?&rsquo;
Therewith he drew forth his sword and hove it aloft as if to
hew down Face-of-god, who spake not nor flinched nor raised a
hand from his side.&nbsp; But the Bride threw herself in front of
Gold-mane, while there arose an angry cry of &lsquo;The Peace of
the Holy Thing!&nbsp; Peace-breaking, peace-breaking!&rsquo; and
some cried, &lsquo;For the War-leader, the War-leader!&rsquo; and
as men could for the press they drew forth their swords, and
there was tumult and noise all over the Thing-stead.
But Stone-face caught hold of the Alderman&rsquo;s right arm
and dragged down the sword, and the big carle, Red-coat of
Waterless, came up behind him and cast his arms about his middle
and drew him back; and presently he looked around him, and slowly
sheathed his sword, and went back to his place and sat him down;
and in a little while the noise abated and swords were sheathed,
p. 188and men
waxed quiet again, and the Alderman arose and said in a loud
voice, but in the wonted way of the head man of the Thing:
&lsquo;Here hath been trouble in the Holy Thing; a violent man
hath troubled it, and drawn sword on a neighbour; will the
neighbours give the dooming hereof into the hands of the
Alderman?&rsquo;
Now all knew Iron-face, and they cried out, &lsquo;That will
we.&rsquo;&nbsp; So he spake again:
&lsquo;I doom the troubler of the Peace of the Holy Thing to
pay a fine, to wit double the blood-wite that would be duly paid
for a full-grown freeman of the kindreds.&rsquo;
Then the cry went up and men yeasaid his doom, and all said
that it was well and fairly doomed; and Iron-face sat still.
But Stone-face stood forth and said:
&lsquo;Here have been wild words in the air; and dreams have
taken shape and come amongst us, and have bewitched us, so that
friends and kin have wrangled.&nbsp; And meseemeth that this is
through the wizardry of these felons, who, even dead as they are,
have cast spells over us.&nbsp; Good it were to cast them into
the Death Tarn, and then to get to our work; for there is much to
do.&rsquo;
All men yeasaid that; and Forkbeard of Lea went with those who
had borne the corpses thither to cast them into the black
pool.
But the Fiddle spake and said:
&lsquo;Stone-face sayeth sooth.&nbsp; O Alderman, thou art no
young man, yet am I old enough to be thy father; so will I give
thee a rede, and say this: Face-of-god thy son is no liar or
dastard or beguiler, but he is a young man and exceeding goodly
of fashion, well-spoken and kind; so that few women may look on
him and hear him without desiring his kindness and love, and to
such men as this many things happen.&nbsp; Moreover, he hath now
become our captain, and is a deft warrior with his hands, and as
I deem, a sober and careful leader of men; therefore we need him
and his courage and his skill of leading.&nbsp; So rage not
against him as if he had done an ill deed not to be
forgiven&mdash;whatever he hath done,  span
class="pagenum">p. 189whereof we know not&mdash;for life
is long before him, and most like we shall still have to thank
him for many good deeds towards us.&nbsp; As for the maiden, she
is both lovely and wise.&nbsp; She hath a sorrow at her heart,
and we deem that we know what it is.&nbsp; Yet hath she not lied
when she said that she would bear the burden of the griefs of the
people.&nbsp; Even so shall she do; and whether she will, or
whether she will not, that shall heal her own griefs.&nbsp; For
to-morrow is a new day.&nbsp; Therefore, if thou do after my
rede, thou wilt not meddle betwixt these twain, but wilt remember
all that we have to do, and that war is coming upon us.&nbsp; And
when that is over, we shall turn round and behold each other, and
see that we are not wholly what we were before; and then shall
that which were hard to forgive, be forgotten, and that which is
remembered be easy to forgive.&rsquo;
So he spake; and Iron-face sat still and put his left hand to
his beard as one who pondereth; but the Bride looked in the face
of the old man the Fiddle, and then she turned and looked at
Gold-mane, and her face softened, and she stood before the
Alderman, and bent down before him and held out both her hands to
him the palms upward.&nbsp; Then she said: &lsquo;Thou hast been
wroth with me, and I marvel not; for thy hope, and the hope which
we all had, hath deceived thee.&nbsp; But kind indeed hast thou
been to me ere now: therefore I pray thee take it not amiss if I
call to thy mind the oath which thou swearedst on the Holy Boar
last Yule, that thou wouldst not gainsay the prayer of any man if
thou couldest perform it; therefore I bid thee naysay not mine:
and that is, that thou wilt ask me no more about this matter, but
wilt suffer me to fare afield like any swain of the Dale, and to
deal so with my folk that they shall not hinder me.&nbsp; Also I
pray thee that thou wilt put no shame upon Face-of-god my
playmate and my kinsman, nor show thine anger to him openly, even
if for a little while thy love for him be abated.&nbsp; No more
than this will I ask of thee.&rsquo;
All men who heard her were moved to the heart by her kindness
p. 190and the
sweetness of her voice, which was like to the robin singing
suddenly on a frosty morning of early winter.&nbsp; But as for
Gold-mane, his heart was smitten sorely by it, and her sorrow and
her friendliness grieved him out of measure.
But Iron-face answered after a little while, speaking slowly
and hoarsely, and with the shame yet clinging to him of a man who
has been wroth and has speedily let his wrath run off him.&nbsp;
So he said:
&lsquo;It is well, my daughter.&nbsp; I have no will to
forswear myself; nor hast thou asked me a thing which is
over-hard.&nbsp; Yet indeed I would that to-day were yesterday,
or that many days were worn away.&rsquo;
Then he stood up and cried in a loud voice over the
throng:
&lsquo;Let none forget the muster; but hold him ready against
the time that the Warden shall come to him.&nbsp; Let all men
obey the War-leader, Face-of-god, without question or
delay.&nbsp; As to the fine of the peace-breaker, it shall be
laid on the altar of the God at the Great Folk-mote.&nbsp;
Herewith is the Thing broken up.&rsquo;
Then all men shouted and clashed their weapons, and so
sundered, and went about their business.
And the talk of men it was that the breaking of the
troth-plight between those twain was ill; for they loved
Face-of-god, and as for the Bride they deemed her the Dearest of
the kindreds and the Jewel of the Folk, and as if she were the
fairest and the kindest of all the Gods.&nbsp; Neither did the
wrath of Iron-face mislike any; but they said he had done well
and manly both to be wroth and to let his wrath run off
him.&nbsp; As to the war which was to come, they kept a good
heart about it, and deemed it as a game to be played, wherein
they might show themselves deft and valiant, and so get back to
their merry life again.
So wore the day through afternoon to even and night.

191CHAPTER XXVII.&nbsp; FACE-OF-GOD LEADETH A BAND THROUGH
THE WOOD.
Next morning tryst was held
faithfully, and an hundred and a half were gathered together on
Wildlake&rsquo;s Way; and Face-of-god ordered them into three
companies.&nbsp; He made Hall-face leader over the first one, and
bade him hold on his way northward, and then to make for
Boars-bait and see if he should meet with anything thereabout
where the battle had been.&nbsp; Red-coat of Waterless he made
captain of the second band; and he had it in charge to wend
eastward along the edge of the Dale, and not to go deep into the
wood, but to go as far as he might within the time appointed,
toward the Mountains.&nbsp; Furthermore, he bade both Hall-face
and Red-coat to bring their bands back to Wildlake&rsquo;s Way by
the morrow at sunset, where other goodmen should be come to take
the places of their men; and then if he and his company were back
again, he would bid them further what to do; but if not, as
seemed likely, then Hall-face&rsquo;s band to go west toward the
Shepherd country half a day&rsquo;s journey, and so back, and
Red-coat&rsquo;s east along the Dale&rsquo;s lip again for the
like time, and then back, so that there might be a constant watch
and ward of the Dale kept against the Felons.
All being ordered Gold-mane led his own company north-east
through the thick wood, thinking that he might so fare as to come
nigh to Silver-dale, or at least to hear tidings thereof.&nbsp;
This intent he told to Stone-face, but the old man shook his head
and said:
&lsquo;Good is this if it may be done; but it is not for
everyone to go down to Hell in his lifetime and come back safe
with a tale thereof.&nbsp; However, whither thou wilt lead,
thither will I follow, though assured death waylayeth
us.&rsquo;
And the old carle was joyous and proud to be on this
adventure, and said, that it was good indeed that his foster-son
had with p.
192him a man well stricken in years, who had both seen
many things, and learned many, and had good rede to give to
valiant men.
So they went on their ways, and fared very warily when they
were gotten beyond those parts of the wood which they knew
well.&nbsp; By this time they were strung out in a long line; and
they noted their road carefully, blazing the trees on either side
when there were trees, and piling up little stone-heaps where the
trees failed them.&nbsp; For Stone-face said that oft it befell
men amidst the thicket and the waste to be misled by wights that
begrudged men their lives, so that they went round and round in a
ring which they might not depart from till they died; and no man
doubted his word herein.
All day they went, and met no foe, nay, no man at all; nought
but the wild things of the wood; and that day the wood changed
little about them from mile to mile.&nbsp; There were many
thickets across their road which they had to go round about; so
that to the crow flying over the tree-tops the journey had not
been long to the place where night came upon them, and where they
had to make the wood their bedchamber.
That night they lighted no fire, but ate such cold victual as
they might carry with them; nor had they shot any venison, since
they had with them more than enough; they made little noise or
stir therefore and fell asleep when they had set the watch.
On the morrow they arose betimes, and broke their fast and
went their ways till noon: by then the wood had thinned somewhat,
and there was little underwood betwixt the scrubby oak and ash
which were pretty nigh all the trees about: the ground also was
broken, and here and there rocky, and they went into and out of
rough little dales, most of which had in them a brook of water
running west and southwest; and now Face-of-god led his men
somewhat more easterly; and still for some while they met no
man.
At last, about four hours after noon, when they were going
less warily, because they had hitherto come across nothing to  a
name="page193">p. 193hinder
them, rising over the brow of a somewhat steep ridge, they saw
down in the valley below them a half score of men sitting by the
brook-side eating and drinking, their weapons lying beside them,
and along with them stood a woman with her hands tied behind her
back.
They saw at once that these men were of the Felons, so they
that had their bows bent, loosed at them without more ado, while
the others ran in upon them with sword and spear.&nbsp; The
felons leapt up and ran scattering down the dale, such of them as
were not smitten by the shafts; but he who was nighest to the
woman, ere he ran, turned and caught up a sword from the ground
and thrust it through her, and the next moment fell across the
brook with an arrow in his back.
No one of the felons was nimble enough to escape from the
fleet-foot hunters of Burgdale, and they were all slain there to
the number of eleven.
But when they came back to the woman to tend her, she breathed
her last in their hands: she was a young and fair woman,
black-haired and dark-eyed.&nbsp; She had on her body a gown of
rich web, but nought else: she had been bruised and sore
mishandled, and the Burgdale carles wept for pity of her, and for
wrath, as they straightened her limbs on the turf of the little
valley.&nbsp; They let her lie there a little, whilst they
searched round about, lest there should be any other poor soul
needing their help, or any felon lurking thereby; but they found
nought else save a bundle wherein was another rich gown and
divers woman&rsquo;s gear, and sundry rings and jewels, and
therewithal the weapons and war-gear of a knight, delicately
wrought after the Westland fashion: these seemed to them to
betoken other foul deeds of these murder-carles.&nbsp; So when
they had abided a while, they laid the dead woman in mould by the
brook-side, and buried with her the other woman&rsquo;s attire
and the knight&rsquo;s gear, all but his sword and shield, which
they had away with them: then they cast the carcasses of the
felons into the brake, but brought away their weapons and the
silver rings from p.
194their arms, which they wore like all the others of them
whom they had fallen in with; and so went on their way to the
north-east, full of wrath against those dastards of the
Earth.
It was hard on sunset when they left the valley of murder, and
they went no long way thence before they must needs make stay for
the night; and when they had arrayed their sleeping-stead the
moon was up, and they saw that before them lay the close wood
again, for they had made their lair on the top of a little
ridge.
There then they lay, and nought stirred them in the night, and
betimes on the morrow they were afoot, and entered the abovesaid
thicket, wherein two of them, keen hunters, had been aforetime,
but had not gone deep into it.&nbsp; Through this wood they went
all day toward the north-east, and met nought but the wild things
therein.&nbsp; At last, when it was near sunset, they came out of
the thicket into a small plain, or shallow dale rather, with no
great trees in it, but thorn-brakes here and there where the
ground sank into hollows; a little river ran through the midst of
it, and winded round about a height whose face toward the river
went down sheer into the water, but away from it sank down in a
long slope to where the thick wood began again: and this height
or burg looked well-nigh west.
Thitherward they went; but as they were drawing nigh to the
river, and were on the top of a bent above a bushy hollow between
them and the water, they espied a man standing in the river near
the bank, who saw them not, because he was stooping down intent
on something in the bank or under it: so they gat them speedily
down into the hollow without noise, that they might get some
tidings of the man.
Then Face-of-god bade his men abide hidden under the bushes
and stole forward quietly up the further bank of the hollow, his
target on his arm and his spear poised.&nbsp; When he was behind
the last bush on the top of the bent he was within half a
spear-cast of the water and the man; so he looked on him and saw
that he was quite naked except for a clout about his middle.
p.
195Face-of-god saw at once that he was not one of the
Dusky Men; he was a black-haired man, but white-skinned, and of
fair stature, though not so tall as the Burgdale folk.&nbsp; He
was busied in tickling trouts, and just as Face-of-god came out
from the bush into the westering sunlight, he threw up a fish on
to the bank, and looked up therewithal, and beheld the weaponed
man glittering, and uttered a cry, but fled not when he saw the
spear poised for casting.
Then Face-of-god spake to him and said: &lsquo;Come hither,
Woodsman! we will not harm thee, but we desire speech of thee:
and it will not avail thee to flee, since I have bowmen of the
best in the hollow yonder.&rsquo;
The man put forth his hands towards him as if praying him to
forbear casting, and looked at him hard, and then came dripping
from out the water, and seemed not greatly afeard; for he stooped
down and picked up the trouts he had taken, and came towards
Face-of-god stringing the last-caught one through the gills on to
the withy whereon were the others: and Face-of-god saw that he
was a goodly man of some thirty winters.
Then Face-of-god looked on him with friendly eyes and
said:
&lsquo;Art thou a foemen? or wilt thou be helpful to
us?&rsquo;
He answered in the speech of the kindreds with the hoarse
voice of a much weather-beaten man:
&lsquo;Thou seest, lord, that I am naked and
unarmed.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yet may&rsquo;st thou bewray us,&rsquo; said
Face-of-god.&nbsp; &lsquo;What man art thou?&rsquo;
Said the man: &lsquo;I am the runaway thrall of evil men; I
have fled from Rose-dale and the Dusky Men.&nbsp; Hast thou the
heart to hurt me?&rsquo;
&lsquo;We are the foemen of the Dusky Men,&rsquo; said
Face-of-God; &lsquo;wilt thou help us against them?&rsquo;
The man knit his brows and said: &lsquo;Yea, if ye will give
me your word not to suffer me to fall into their hands
alive.&nbsp; But whence art thou, to be so bold?&rsquo;
p. 196Said
Face-of-god: &lsquo;We are of Burgdale; and I will swear to thee
on the edge of the sword that thou shalt not fall alive into the
hands of the Dusky Men.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Of Burgdale have I heard,&rsquo; said the man;
&lsquo;and in sooth thou seemest not such a man as would bewray a
hapless man.&nbsp; But now had I best bring you to some
lurking-place where ye shall not be easily found of these devils,
who now oft-times scour the woods hereabout.&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;Come first and see my fellows; and
then if thou thinkest we have need to hide, it is
well.&rsquo;
So the man went side by side with him towards their lair, and
as they went Gold-mane noted marks of stripes on his back and
sides, and said: &lsquo;Sorely hast thou been mishandled, poor
man!&rsquo;
Then the man turned on him and said somewhat fiercely:
&lsquo;Said I not that I had been a thrall of the Dusky Men? how
then should I have escaped tormenting and scourging, if I had
been with them for but three days?&rsquo;
As he spake they came about a thorn-bush, and there were the
Burgdale men down in the hollow; and the man said: &lsquo;Are
these thy fellows?&nbsp; Call to mind that thou hast sworn by the
edge of the sword not to hurt me.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Poor man!&rsquo; said Face-of-god; &lsquo;these are thy
friends, unless thou bewrayest us.&rsquo;
Then he cried aloud to his folk: &lsquo;Here is now a good
hap! this is a runaway thrall of the Dusky Men; of him shall we
hear tidings; so cherish him all ye may.&rsquo;
So the carles thronged about him and bestirred themselves to
help him, and one gave him his surcoat for a kirtle, and another
cast a cloak about him; and they brought him meat and drink, such
as they had ready to hand: and the man looked as if he scarce
believed in all this, but deemed himself to be in a dream.&nbsp;
But presently he turned to Face-of-god and said:
&lsquo;Now I see so many men and weapons I deem that ye have
no need to skulk in caves to-night, though I know of good ones:
p. 197yet
shall ye do well not to light a fire till moon-setting; for the
flame ye may lightly hide, but the smoke may be seen from far
aloof.&rsquo;
But they bade him to meat, and he needed no second bidding but
ate lustily, and they gave him wine, and he drank a great draught
and sighed as for joy.&nbsp; Then he said in a trembling voice,
as though he feared a naysay:
&lsquo;If ye are from Burgdale ye shall be faring back again
presently; and I pray you to take me with you.&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;Yea surely, friend, that will we do,
and rejoice in thee.&rsquo;
Then he drank another cup which Warcliff held out to him, and
spake again: &lsquo;Yet if ye would abide here till about noon
to-morrow, or mayhappen a little later, I would bring other
runaways to see you; and them also might ye take with you: ye may
think when ye see them that ye shall have small gain of their
company; for poor wretched folk they be, like to myself.&nbsp;
Yet since ye seek for tidings, herein might they do you more
service than I; for amongst them are some who came out of the
hapless Dale within this moon; and it is six months since I
escaped.&nbsp; Moreover, though they may look spent and outworn
now, yet if ye give them a little rest, and feed them well, they
shall yet do many a day&rsquo;s work for you: and I tell you that
if ye take them for thralls, and put collars on their necks, and
use them no worse than a goodman useth his oxen and his asses,
beating them not save when they are idle or at fault, it shall be
to them as if they were come to heaven out of hell, and to such
goodhap as they have not thought of, save in dreams, for many and
many a day.&nbsp; And thus I entreat you to do because ye seem to
me to be happy and merciful men, who will not begrudge us this
happiness.&rsquo;
The carles of Burgdale listened eagerly to what he said, and
they looked at him with great eyes and marvelled; and their
hearts were moved with pity towards him; and Stone-face said:
p.
198&lsquo;Herein, O War-leader, need I give thee no rede,
for thou mayst see clearly that all we deem that we should lose
our manhood and become the dastards of the Warrior if we did not
abide the coming of these poor men, and take them back to the
Dale, and cherish them.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said Wolf of Whitegarth, &lsquo;and great
thanks we owe to this man that he biddeth us this: for great will
be the gain to us if we become so like the Gods that we may
deliver the poor from misery.&nbsp; Now must I needs think how
they shall wonder when they come to Burgdale and find out how
happy it is to dwell there.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;thus shall we
do, whatever cometh of it.&nbsp; But, friend of the wood, as to
thralls, there be none such in the Dale, but therein are all men
friends and neighbours, and even so shall ye be.&rsquo;
And he fell a-musing, when he bethought him of how little he
had known of sorrow.
But that man, when he beheld the happy faces of the
Burgdalers, and hearkened to their friendly voices, and
understood what they said, and he also was become strong with the
meat and drink, he bowed his head adown and wept a long while;
and they meddled not with him, till he turned again to them and
said:
&lsquo;Since ye are in arms, and seem to be seeking your
foemen, I suppose ye wot that these tyrants and man-quellers will
fall upon you in Burgdale ere the summer is well worn.&rsquo;
&lsquo;So much we deem indeed,&rsquo; said Face-of-god,
&lsquo;but we were fain to hear the certainty of it, and how thou
knowest thereof.&rsquo;
Said the man: &lsquo;It was six moons ago that I fled, as I
have told you; and even then it was the common talk amongst our
masters that there were fair dales to the south which they would
overrun.&nbsp; Man would say to man: We were over many in
Silver-dale, and we needed more thralls, because those we had
were lessening, and especially the women; now are we more at ease
p. 199in
Rose-dale, though we have sent thralls to Silver-dale; but yet we
can bear no more men from thence to eat up our stock from us: let
them fare south to the happy dales, and conquer them, and we will
go with them and help therein, whether we come back to Rose-dale
or no.&nbsp; Such talk did I hear then with mine own ears: but
some of those whom I shall bring to you to-morrow shall know
better what is doing, since they have fled from Rose-dale but a
few days.&nbsp; Moreover, there is a man and a woman who have
fled from Silver-dale itself, and are but a month from it,
journeying all the time save when they must needs hide; and these
say that their masters have got to know the way to Burgdale, and
are minded for it before the winter, as I said; and nought else
but the ways thither do they desire to know, since they have no
fear.&rsquo;
By then was night come, and though the moon was high in
heaven, and lighted all that waste, the Burgdalers must needs
light a fire for cooking their meat, whatsoever that woodsman
might say; moreover, the night was cold and somewhat
frosty.&nbsp; A little before they had come to that place they
had shot a fat buck and some smaller deer, but of other meat they
had no great store, though there was wine enough.&nbsp; So they
lit their fire in the thickest of the thorn-bush to hide it all
they might, and thereat they cooked their venison and the trouts
which the runaway had taken, and they fell to, and ate and drank
and were merry, making much of that poor man till him-seemed he
was gotten into the company of the kindest of the Gods.
But when they were full, Face-of-god spake to him, and asked
him his name; and he named himself Dallach; but said he:
&lsquo;Lord, this is according to the naming of men in Rose-dale
before we were enthralled: but now what names have thralls?&nbsp;
Also I am not altogether of the blood of them of Rose-dale, but
of better and more warrior-like kin.&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;Thou hast named Silver-dale; knowest
thou it?&rsquo;
p.
200Dallach answered: &lsquo;I have never seen it.&nbsp; It
is far hence; in a week&rsquo;s journey, making all diligence,
and not being forced to hide and skulk like those runaways, ye
shall come to the mouth thereof lying west, where its rock-walls
fall off toward the plain.&rsquo;
&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;is there no other
way into that Dale?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay, none that folk wot of,&rsquo; said Dallach,
&lsquo;except to bold cragsmen with their lives in their
hands.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Knowest thou aught of the affairs of
Silver-dale?&rsquo; said Face-of-god.
Said Dallach: &lsquo;Somewhat I know: we wot that but a few
years ago there was a valiant folk dwelling therein, who were
lords of the whole dale, and that they were vanquished by the
Dusky Men: but whether they were all slain and enthralled we wot
not; but we deem it otherwise.&nbsp; As for me it is of their
blood that I am partly come; for my father&rsquo;s father came
thence to settle in Rose-dale, and wedded a woman of the Dale,
who was my father&rsquo;s mother.&rsquo;
&lsquo;When was it that ye fell under the Dusky Men?&rsquo;
said Face-of-god.
Said Dallach: &lsquo;It was five years ago.&nbsp; They came
into the Dale a great company, all in arms.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Was there battle betwixt you?&rsquo; said
Face-of-god.
&lsquo;Alas! not so,&rsquo; said Dallach.&nbsp; &lsquo;We were
a happy folk there; but soft and delicate: for the Dale is
exceeding fertile, and beareth wealth in abundance, both corn and
oil and wine and fruit, and of beasts for man&rsquo;s service the
best that may be.&nbsp; Would that there had been battle, and
that I had died therein with those that had a heart to fight; and
even so saith now every man, yea, every woman in the Dale.&nbsp;
But it was not so when the elders met in our Council-House on the
day when the Dusky Men bade us pay them tribute and give them
houses to dwell in and lands to live by.&nbsp; Then had we
weapons in our hands, but no hearts to use them.&rsquo;
p.
201&lsquo;What befell then?&rsquo; said the goodman of
Whitegarth.
Said Dallach: &lsquo;Look ye to it, lords, that it befall not
in Burgdale!&nbsp; We gave them all they asked for, and deemed we
had much left.&nbsp; What befell, sayst thou?&nbsp; We sat quiet;
we went about our work in fear and trembling, for grim and
hideous were they to look on.&nbsp; At first they meddled not
much with us, save to take from our houses what they would of
meat and drink, or raiment, or plenishing.&nbsp; And all this we
deemed we might bear, and that we needed no more than to toil a
little more each day so as to win somewhat more of wealth.&nbsp;
But soon we found that it would not be so; for they had no mind
to till the teeming earth or work in the acres we had given them,
or to sit at the loom, or hammer in the stithy, or do any manlike
work; it was we that must do all that for their behoof, and it
was altogether for them that we laboured, and nought for
ourselves; and our bodies were only so much our own as they were
needful to be kept alive for labour.&nbsp; Herein were our tasks
harder than the toil of any mules or asses, save for the younger
and goodlier of the women, whom they would keep fair and delicate
to be their bed-thralls.
&lsquo;Yet not even so were our bodies safe from their malice:
for these men were not only tyrants, but fools and madmen.&nbsp;
Let alone that there were few days without stripes and torments
to satiate their fury or their pleasure, so that in all streets
and nigh any house might you hear wailing and screaming and
groaning; but moreover, though a wise man would not willingly
slay his own thrall any more than his own horse or ox, yet did
these men so wax in folly and malice, that they would often hew
at man or woman as they met them in the way from mere grimness of
soul; and if they slew them it was well.&nbsp; Thereof indeed
came quarrels enough betwixt master and master, for they are much
given to man-slaying amongst themselves: but what profit to us
thereof?&nbsp; Nay, if the dead man were a chieftain, then woe
betide the thralls! for thereof must many an one be slain on his
grave-mound to serve him on the hell-road.&nbsp; To be short: we
have heard of men who be  span
class="pagenum">p. 202fierce, and men who be grim; but
these we may scarce believe us to be men at all, but trolls
rather; and ill will it be if their race waxeth in the
world.&rsquo;
The Burgdale men hearkened with all their ears, and wondered
that such things could befall; and they rejoiced at the work that
lay before them, and their hearts rose high at the thought of
battle in that behalf, and the fame that should come of it.&nbsp;
As for the runaway, they made so much of him that the man
marvelled; for they dealt with him like a woman cherishing a son,
and knew not how to be kind enough to him.
CHAPTER XXVIII.&nbsp; THE MEN OF BURGDALE MEET THE
RUNAWAYS.
Now ere the night was far spent,
Dallach arose and said:
&lsquo;Kind folk, ye will presently be sleeping; but I bid you
keep a good watch, and if ye will be ruled by me, ye will kindle
no fire on the morrow, for the smoke riseth thick in the morning
air, and is as a beacon.&nbsp; As for me, I shall leave you here
to rest, and I myself will fare on mine errand.&rsquo;
They bade him sleep and rest him after so many toils and
hardships, saying that they were not tied to an hour to be back
in Burgdale; but he said: &lsquo;Nay, the moon is high, and it is
as good as daylight to me, who could find my way even by
starlight; and your tarrying here is nowise safe.&nbsp; Moreover,
if I could find those folk and bring them part of the way by
night and cloud it were well; for if we were taken again, burning
quick would be the best death by which we should die.&nbsp; As
for me, now am I strong with meat and drink and hope; and when I
come to Burgdale there will be time enough for resting and
slumber.&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;Shall I not wend with thee to see
these people and the lairs wherein they hide?&rsquo;
The man smiled: &lsquo;Nay, earl,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that
shall not be.&nbsp;  span
class="pagenum">p. 203For wot ye what?&nbsp; If they were
to see me in company of a man-at-arms they would deem that I was
bringing the foe upon them, and would flee, or mayhappen would
fall upon us.&nbsp; For as for me, when I saw thee, thou wert
close anigh me, so I knew thee to be no Dusky Man; but they would
see the glitter of thine arms from afar, and to them all weaponed
men are foemen.&nbsp; Thou, lord, knowest not the heart of a
thrall, nor the fear and doubt that is in it.&nbsp; Nay, I myself
must cast off these clothes that ye have given me, and fare
naked, lest they mistrust me.&nbsp; Only I will take a spear in
my hand, and sling a knife round my neck, if ye will give them to
me; for if the worst happen, I will not be taken
alive.&rsquo;
Therewith he cast off his raiment, and they gave him the
weapons and wished him good speed, and he went his way twixt
moonlight and shadow; but the Burgdalers went to sleep when they
had set a watch.
Early in the morning they awoke, and the sun was shining and
the thrushes singing in the thorn-brake, and all seemed fair and
peaceful, and a little haze still hung about the face of the burg
over the river.&nbsp; So they went down to the water and washed
the night from off them; and thence the most part of them went
back to their lair among the thorn-bushes: but four of them went
up the dale into the oak-wood to shoot a buck, and five more they
sent out to watch their skirts around them; and Face-of-god with
old Stone-face went over a ford of the stream, and came on to the
lower slope of the burg, and so went up it to the top.&nbsp;
Thence they looked about to see if aught were stirring, but they
saw little save the waste and the wood, which on the north-east
was thick of big trees stretching out a long way.&nbsp; Their own
lair was clear to see over its bank and the bushes thereof, and
that misliked Face-of-god, lest any foe should climb the burg
that day.&nbsp; The morning was clear, and Face-of-god looking
north-and-by-west deemed he saw smoke rising into the air over
the tree-covered ridges that hid the further distance toward that
a&iacute;rt, though further east uphove the black shoulders of
the Great that p.
204Waste and the snowy peaks behind them.&nbsp; The said
smoke was not such as cometh from one great fire, but was like a
thin veil staining the pale blue sky, as when men are burning
ling on the heath-side and it is seen aloof.
He showed that smoke to Stone-face, who smiled and said:
&lsquo;Now will they be lighting the cooking fires in
Rose-dale: would I were there with a few hundreds of axes and
staves at my back!&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, smiling in his face,
&lsquo;but where I pray thee are these elves and wood-wights,
that we meet them not?&nbsp; Grim things there are in the woods,
and things fair enough also: but meseemeth that the trolls and
the elves of thy young years have been frighted away.&rsquo;
Said Stone-face: &lsquo;Maybe, foster-son; that hath been seen
ere now, that when one race of man overrunneth the land inhabited
by another, the wights and elves that love the vanquished are
seen no more, or get them away far off into the outermost wilds,
where few men ever come.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;that may well
be.&nbsp; But deemest thou by that token that we shall be
vanquished?&rsquo;
&lsquo;As for us, I know not,&rsquo; said Stone-face;
&lsquo;but thy friends of Shadowy Vale have been
vanquished.&nbsp; Moreover, concerning these felons whom now we
are hunting, are we all so sure that they be men?&nbsp; Certain
it is, that when I go into battle with them, I shall smite with
no more pity than my sword, as if I were smiting things that may
not feel the woes of man.&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;Yea, even so shall it be with
me.&nbsp; But what thinkest thou of these runaways?&nbsp; Shall
we have tidings of them, or shall Dallach bring the foe upon
us?&nbsp; It was for the sake of that question that I have clomb
the burg: and that we might watch the land about us.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Stone-face, &lsquo;I have seen many
men, and I deem of Dallach that he is a true man.&nbsp; I deem we
shall soon have tidings of his fellows; and they may have seen
the elves and wood-wights: I would fain ask them thereof, and am
eager to see them.&rsquo;
p. 205Said
Face-of-god: &lsquo;And I somewhat dread to see them, and their
rags and their misery and the weals of their stripes.&nbsp; It
irked me to see Dallach when he first fell to his meat last
night, how he ate like a dog for fear and famine.&nbsp; How shall
it be, moreover, when we have them in the Dale, and they fall to
the deed of kind there, as they needs must.&nbsp; Will they not
bear us evil and thrall-like men?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Maybe,&rsquo; said Stone-face, &lsquo;and maybe not;
for they have been thralls but for a little while: and I deem
that in no long time shall ye see them much bettered by plenteous
meat and rest.&nbsp; And after all is said, this Dallach bore him
like a valiant man; also it was valiant of him to flee; and of
the others may ye say the like.&nbsp; But look you! there are men
going down yonder towards our lair: belike those shall be our
guests, and there be no Dusky Men amongst them.&nbsp; Come, let
us home!&rsquo;
So Face-of-god looked and beheld from the height of the burg
shapes of men grey and colourless creeping toward the lair from
sunshine to shadow, like wild creatures shy and fearful of the
hunter, or so he deemed of them.
So he turned away, angry and sad of heart, and the twain went
down the burg and across the water to their camp, having seen
little to tell of from the height.
When they came to their campment there were their folk
standing in a ring round about Dallach and the other
runaways.&nbsp; They made way for the War-leader and Stone-face,
who came amongst them and beheld the Runaways, that they were
many more than they looked to see; for they were of carles one
score and three, and of women eighteen, all told save
Dallach.&nbsp; When they saw those twain come through the ring of
men and perceived that they were chieftains, some of them fell
down on their knees before them and held out their joined hands
to them, and kissed the Burgdalers&rsquo; feet and the hems of
their garments, while the tears streamed out of their eyes: some
stood moving little and staring before them stupidly: and some
kept glancing from face to face of the well-liking  a
name="page206">p. 206happy
Burgdale carles, though for a while even their faces were sad and
downcast at the sight of the poor men: some also kept murmuring
one or two words in their country tongue, and Dallach told
Face-of-god that these were crying out for victual.
It must be said of these poor folk that they were of divers
conditions, and chiefly of three: and first there were seven of
Rose-dale and five of Silver-dale late come to the wood (of these
Silver-dalers Dallach had told but of two, for the other three
were but just come).&nbsp; Of these twelve were seven women, and
all, save two of the women, were clad in one scanty kirtle or
shirt only; for such was the wont of the Dusky Men with their
thralls.&nbsp; They had brought away weapons, and had amongst
them six axes and a spear, and a sword, and five knives, and one
man had a shield.
Yet though these were clad and armed, yet in some wise were
they the worst of all; they were so timorous and cringing, and
most of them heavy-eyed and sullen and down-looking.&nbsp; Many
of them had been grievously mishandled: one man had had his left
hand smitten off; another was docked of three of his toes, and
the gristle of his nose slit up; one was halt, and four had been
ear-cropped, nor did any lack weals of whipping.&nbsp; Of the
Silver-dale new-comers the three men were the worst of all the
Runaways, with wild wandering eyes, but sullen also, and cringing
if any drew nigh, and would not look anyone in the face, save
presently Face-of-god, on whom they were soon fond to fawn, as a
dog on his master.&nbsp; But the women who were with them, and
who were well-nigh as timorous as the men, were those two
gaily-dad ones, and they were soft-handed and white-skinned, save
for the last days of weather in the wood; for they had been
bed-thralls of the Dusky Men.
Such were the new-comers to the wood.&nbsp; But others had
been, like Dallach, months therein; it may be said that there
were eighteen of these, carles and queens together.&nbsp; Little
raiment they had amongst them, and some were all but stark naked,
so that on these might well be seen as on Dallach the marks of
old p.
207stripes, and of these also were there men who had been
shorn of some member or other, and they were all burnt and
blackened by the weather of the woodland; yet for all their
nakedness, they bore themselves bolder and more manlike than the
later comers, nor did they altogether lack weapons taken from
their foemen, and most of them had some edge-tool or
another.&nbsp; Of these folk were four from Silver-dale, though
Dallach knew it not.
Besides these were a half score and one who had been years in
the wood instead of months; weather-beaten indeed were these,
shaggy and rough-skinned like wild men of kind.&nbsp; Some of
them had made themselves skin breeches or clouts, some went stark
naked; of weapons of the Dale had they few, but they bore bows of
hazel or wych-elm strung with deer-gut, and shafts headed with
flint stones; staves also of the same fashion, and great clubs of
oak or holly: some of them also had made them targets of skin and
willow-twigs, for these were the warriors of the Runaways: they
had a few steel knives amongst them, but had mostly learned the
craft of using sharp flints for knives: but four of these were
women.
Three of these men were of the kindreds of the Wolf from
Silver-dale, and had been in the wood for hard upon ten years,
and wild as they were, and without hope of meeting their fellows
again, they went proudly and boldly amongst the others,
overtopping them by the head and more.&nbsp; For the greater part
of these men were somewhat short of stature, though by nature
strong and stout of body.
It must be told that though Dallach had thus gotten all these
many Runaways together, yet had they not been dwelling together
as one folk; for they durst not, lest the Dusky Men should hear
thereof and fall upon them, but they had kept themselves as best
they could in caves and in brakes three together or two, or even
faring alone as Dallach did: only as he was a strong and
stout-hearted man, he went to and fro and wandered about more
than the others, so that he foregathered  a
name="page208">p. 208with most
of them and knew them.&nbsp; He said also that he doubted not but
that there were more Runaways in the wood, but these were all he
could come at.&nbsp; Divers who had fled had died from time to
time, and some had been caught and cruelly slain by their
masters.&nbsp; They were none of them old; the oldest, said
Dallach, scant of forty winters, though many from their aspect
might have been old enough.
So Face-of-god looked and beheld all these poor people; and
said to himself, that he might well have dreaded that
sight.&nbsp; For here was he brought face to face with the Sorrow
of the Earth, whereof he had known nought heretofore, save it
might be as a tale in a minstrel&rsquo;s song.&nbsp; And when he
thought of the minutes that had made the hours, and the hours
that had made the days that these men had passed through, his
heart failed him, and he was dumb and might not speak, though he
perceived that the men of Burgdale looked for speech from him;
but he waved his hand to his folk, and they understood him, for
they had heard Dallach say that some of them were crying for
victual.&nbsp; So they set to work and dighted for them such meat
as they had, and they set them down on the grass and made
themselves their carvers and serving-men, and bade them eat what
they would of such as there was.&nbsp; Yet, indeed, it grieved
the Burgdalers again to note how these folk were driven to eat;
for they themselves, though they were merry folk, were exceeding
courteous at table, and of great observance of manners: whereas
these poor Runaways ate, some of them like hungry dogs, and some
hiding their meat as if they feared it should be taken from them,
and some cowering over it like falcons, and scarce any with a
manlike pleasure in their meal.&nbsp; And, their eating over, the
more part of them sat dull and mopish, and as if all things were
forgotten for the time present.
Albeit presently Dallach bestirred him and said to
Face-of-god: &lsquo;Lord of the Earl-folk, if I might give thee
rede, it were best to turn your faces to Burgdale without more
tarrying.&nbsp; For we are over-nigh to Rose-dale, being but thus
many in company.&nbsp;  span
class="pagenum">p. 209But when we come to our next
resting-place, then shall bring thee to speech with the
last-comers from Silver-dale; for there they talk with the tongue
of the kindreds; but we of Rose-dale for the more part talk
otherwise; though in my house it came down from father to
son.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, gazing still on that
unhappy folk, as they sat or lay upon the grass at rest for a
little while: but him-seemed as he gazed that some memories of
past time stirred in some of them; for some, they hung their
heads and the tears stole out of their eyes and rolled down their
cheeks.&nbsp; But those older Runaways of Silver-dale were not
crouched down like most of the others, but strode up and down
like beasts in a den; yet were the tears on the face of one of
these.&nbsp; Then Face-of-god constrained himself, and spake to
the folk, and said: &lsquo;We are now over-nigh to our foes of
Rose-dale to lie here any longer, being too few to fall upon
them.&nbsp; We will come hither again with a host when we have
duly questioned these men who have sought refuge with us: and let
us call yonder height the Burg of the Runaways, and it shall be a
landmark for us when we are on the road to Rose-dale.&rsquo;
Then the Burgdalers bade the Runaways courteously and kindly
to arise and take the road with them; and by that time were their
men all come in; and four of them had venison with them, which
was needful, if they were to eat that night or the morrow, as the
guests had eaten them to the bone.
So they tarried no more, but set out on the homeward way; and
Face-of-god bade Dallach walk beside him, and asked him such
concerning Rose-dale and its Dusky Men.&nbsp; Dallach told him
that these were not so many as they were masterful, not being
above eight hundreds of men, all fighting-men.&nbsp; As to women,
they had none of their own race, but lay with the Daleswomen at
their will, and begat children of them; and all or most of the
said children favoured the race of their begetters.&nbsp; Of the
men-children they reared most, but the women-children they slew
at once; for p.
210they valued not women of their own blood: but besides
the women of the Dale, they would go at whiles in bands to the
edges of the Plain and beguile wayfarers, and bring back with
them thence women to be their bed-thralls; albeit some of these
were bought with a price from the Westland men.
As to the number of the folk of Rose-dale, its own folk, he
said they would number some five thousand souls, one with
another; of whom some thousand might be fit to bear arms if they
had the heart thereto, as they had none.&nbsp; Yet being closely
questioned, he deemed that they might fall on their masters from
behind, if battle were joined.
He said that the folk of Rose-dale had been a goodly folk
before they were enthralled, and peaceable with one another, but
that now it was a sport of the Dusky Men to set a match between
their thralls to fight it out with sword and buckler or
otherwise; and the vanquished man, if he were not sore hurt, they
would scourge, or shear some member from him, or even slay him
outright, if the match between the owners were so made.&nbsp; And
many other sad and grievous tales he told to Face-of-god, more
than need be told again; so that the War-leader went along sorry
and angry, with his teeth set, and his hand on the
sword-hilt.
Thus they went till night fell on them, and they could scarce
see the signs they had made on their outward journey.&nbsp; Then
they made stay in a little valley, having set a watch duly; and
since they were by this time far from Rose-dale, and were a great
company as regarded scattered bands of the foe, they lighted
their fires and cooked their venison, and made good cheer to the
Runaways, and so went to sleep in the wild-wood.
When morning was come they gat them at once to the road; and
if the Burgdalers were eager to be out of the wood, their
eagerness was as nought to the eagerness of the Runaways, most of
whom could not be easy now, and deemed every minute lost unless
they were wending on to the Dale; so that this day they  a
name="page211">p. 211were
willing to get over the more ground, whereas they had not set out
on their road till afternoon yesterday.
Howsoever, they rested at noontide, and Face-of-god bade
Dallach bring him to speech with others of the Runaways, and
first that he might talk with those three men of the kindreds who
had fled from Silver-dale in early days.&nbsp; So Dallach brought
them to him; but he found that though they spake the tongue, they
were so few-spoken from wildness and loneliness, at least at
first, that nought could come from them that was not dragged from
them.
These men said that they had been in the wood more than nine
years, so that they knew but little of the conditions of the Dale
in that present day.&nbsp; However, as to what Dallach had said
concerning the Dusky Men, they strengthened his words; and they
said that the Dusky Men took no delight save in beholding
torments and misery, and that they doubted if they were men or
trolls.&nbsp; They said that since they had dwelt in the wood
they had slain not a few of the foemen, waylaying them as
occasion served, but that in this warfare they had lost two of
their fellows.&nbsp; When Face-of-god asked them of their deeming
of the numbers of the Dusky Men, they said that before those
bands had broken into Rose-dale, they counted them, as far as
they could call to mind, at about three thousand men, all
warriors; and that somewhat less than one thousand had gone up
into Rose-dale, and some had died, and many had been cast away in
the wild-wood, their fellows knew not how.&nbsp; Yet had not
their numbers in Silver-dale diminished; because two years after
they (the speakers) had fled, came three more Dusky Companies or
Tribes into Silver-dale, and each of these tribes was of three
long hundreds; and with their coming had the cruelty and misery
much increased in the Dale, so that the thralls began to die
fast; and that drave the Dusky Men beyond the borders of
Silver-dale, so that they fell upon Rose-dale.&nbsp; When asked
how many of the kindreds might yet be abiding in Silver-dale,
their faces clouded, and they seemed exceeding wroth, and
answered, that they would willingly hope  a
name="page212">p. 212that most
of those that had not been slain at the time of the overthrow
were now dead, yet indeed they feared there were yet some alive,
and mayhappen not a few women.
By then must they get on foot again, and so the talk fell
between them; but when they made stay for the night, after they
had done their meat, Face-of-god prayed Dallach bring to him some
of the latest-come folk from Silver-dale, and he brought to him
the man and the woman who had been in the Dale within that
moon.&nbsp; As to the man, if those of the Earl-folk had been
few-spoken from fierceness and wildness, he was no less so from
mere dulness and weariness of misery; but the woman&rsquo;s
tongue went glibly enough, and it seemed to pleasure her to talk
about her past miseries.&nbsp; As aforesaid, she was better clad
than most of those of Rose-dale, and indeed might be called gaily
clad, and where her raiment was befouled or rent, it was from the
roughness of the wood and its weather, and not from the
thralldom.&nbsp; She was a young and fair woman, black-haired and
grey-eyed.&nbsp; She had washed herself that day in a woodland
stream which they had crossed on the road, and had arrayed her
garments as trimly as she might, and had plucked some fumitory,
wherewith she had made a garland for her head.&nbsp; She sat down
on the grass in front of Face-of-god, while the man her mate
stood leaning against a tree and looked on her greedily.&nbsp;
The Burgdale carles drew near to her to hearken her story, and
looked kindly on the twain.&nbsp; She smiled on them, but
especially on Face-of-god, and said:
&lsquo;Thou hast sent for me, lord, and I wot well thou
wouldst hear my tale shortly, for it would be long to tell if I
were to tell it fully, and bring into it all that I have endured,
which has been bitter enough, for all that ye see me smooth of
skin and well-liking of body.&nbsp; I have been the bed-thrall of
one of the chieftains of the Dusky Men, at whose house many of
their great men would assemble, so that ye may ask me whatso ye
will; as I have heard much talk and may call it to mind.&nbsp;
Now if ye ask me whether I have fled because of the shame that I,
a free woman p.
213come of free folk, should be a mere thrall in the bed
of the foes of my kin, and with no price paid for me, I must
needs say it is not so; since over long have we of the Dale been
thralls to be ashamed of such a matter.&nbsp; And again, if ye
deem that I have fled because I have been burdened with grievous
toil and been driven thereto by the whip, ye may look on my hands
and my body and ye will see that I have toiled little therewith:
nor again did I flee because I could not endure a few stripes now
and again; for such usage do thralls look for, even when they are
delicately kept for the sake of the fairness of their bodies, and
this they may well endure; yea also, and the mere fear of death
by torment now and again.&nbsp; But before me lay death both
assured and horrible; so I took mine own counsel, and told none
for fear of bewrayal, save him who guarded me; and that was this
man; who fled not from fear, but from love of me, and to him I
have given all that I might give.&nbsp; So we got out of the
house and down the Dale by night and cloud, and hid for one whole
day in the Dale itself, where I trembled and feared, so that I
deemed I should die of fear; but this man was well pleased with
my company, and with the lack of toil and beating even for the
day.&nbsp; And in the night again we fled and reached the
wild-wood before dawn, and well-nigh fell into the hands of those
who were hunting us, and had outgone us the day before, as we lay
hid.&nbsp; Well, what is to say?&nbsp; They saw us not, else had
we not been here, but scattered piece-meal over the land.&nbsp;
This carle knew the passes of the wood, because he had followed
his master therein, who was a great hunter in the wastes,
contrary to the wont of these men, and he had lain a night on the
burg yonder; therefore he brought me thither, because he knew
that thereabout was plenty of prey easy to take, and he had a bow
with him; and there we fell in with others of our folk who had
fled before, and with Dallach; who e&rsquo;en now told us what
was hard to believe, that there was a fair young man like one of
the Gods leading a band of goodly warriors, and seeking for us to
bring us into a peaceful and happy land; and this man would  a
name="page214">p. 214not have
gone with him because he feared that he might fall into thralldom
of other folk, who would take me away from him; but for me, I
said I would go in any case, for I was weary of the wood and its
roughness and toil, and that if I had a new master he would
scarcely be worse than my old one was at his best, and him I
could endure.&nbsp; So I went, and glad and glad I am, whatever
ye will do with me.&nbsp; And now will I answer whatso ye may ask
of me.&rsquo;
She laid her limbs together daintily and looked fondly on
Face-of-god, and the carle scowled at her somewhat at first, but
presently, as he watched her, his face smoothed itself out of its
wrinkles.
But Face-of-god pondered a little while, and then asked the
woman if she had heard any words to remember of late days
concerning the affairs of the Dusky Men and their intent; and he
said:
&lsquo;I pray thee, sister, be truthful in thine answer, for
somewhat lieth on it.&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;How could I speak aught but the sooth to
thee, O lovely lord?&nbsp; The last word spoken hereof I mind me
well: for my master had been mishandling me, and I was sullen to
him after the smart, and he mocked and jeered me, and said: Ye
women deem we cannot do without you, but ye are fools, and know
nothing; we are going to conquer a new land where the women are
plenty, and far fairer than ye be; and we shall leave you to fare
afield like the other thralls, or work in the digging of silver;
and belike ye wot what that meaneth.&nbsp; Also he said that they
would leave us to the new tribe of their folk, far wilder than
they, whom they looked for in the Dale in about a moon&rsquo;s
wearing; so that they needs must seek to other lands.&nbsp; Also
this same talk would we hear whenever it pleased any of them to
mock us their bed-thralls.&nbsp; Now, my sweet lord, this is
nought but the very sooth.&rsquo;
Again spake Face-of-god after a while:
&lsquo;Tell me, sister, hast thou heard of any of the Dusky
Men being slain in the wood?&rsquo;
p.
215&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; she said, and turned pale therewith
and caught her breath as one choking; but said in a little
while:
&lsquo;This alone was it hard for me to tell thee amongst all
the I griefs I have borne, whereof I might have told thee many
tales, and will do one day if thou wilt suffer it; but fear makes
this hard for me.&nbsp; For in very sooth this was the cause of
my fleeing, that my master was brought in slain by an arrow in
the wood; and he was to be borne to bale and burned in three
days&rsquo; wearing; and we three bed-thralls of his, and three
of the best of the men-thralls, were to be burned quick on his
bale-fire after sore torments; therefore I fled, and hid a knife
in my bosom, that I might not be taken alive; but sweet was life
to me, and belike I should not have smitten myself.&rsquo;
And she wept sore for pity of herself before them all.&nbsp;
But Face-of-god said:
&lsquo;Knowest thou, sister, by whom the man was
slain?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; she said, still sobbing; &lsquo;but I heard
nought thereof, nor had I noted it in my terror.&nbsp; The death
of others, who were slain before him, and the loss of many, we
knew not how, made them more bitterly cruel with us.&rsquo;
And again was she weeping; but Face-of-god said kindly to her:
&lsquo;Weep no more, sister, for now shall all thy troubles be
over; I feel in my heart that we shall overcome these felons, and
make an end of them, and there then is Burgdale for thee in its
length and breadth, or thine own Dale to dwell in
freely.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;never will I go back
thither!&rsquo; and she turned round to him and kissed his feet,
and then arose and turned a little toward her mate; and the carle
caught her by the hand and led her away, and seemed glad so to
do.
So once again they fell asleep in the woods, and again the
next morning fared on their way early that they might come into
Burgdale before nightfall.&nbsp; When they stayed a while at
noontide and ate, Face-of-god again had talk with the Runaways,
and this time with those of Rose-dale, and he heard much the same
story p.
216from them that he had heard before, told in divers
ways, till his heart was sick with the hearing of it.
On this last day Face-of-god led his men well athwart the
wood, so that he hit Wildlake&rsquo;s Way without coming to
Carl-stead; and he came down into the Dale some four hours after
noon on a bright day of latter March.&nbsp; At the ingate to the
Dale he found watches set, the men whereof told him that the
tidings were not right great.&nbsp; Hall-face&rsquo;s company had
fallen in with a band of the Felons three score in number in the
oak-wood nigh to Boars-bait, and had slain some and chased the
rest, since they found it hard to follow them home as they ran
for the tangled thicket: of the Burgdalers had two been slain and
five hurt in this battle.
As for Red-coat&rsquo;s company, they had fallen in with no
foemen.
CHAPTER XXIX.&nbsp; THEY BRING THE RUNAWAYS TO
BURGSTEAD.
So now being out of the wood, they
went peaceably and safely along the Portway, the Runaways
mingling with the Dalesmen.&nbsp; Strange showed amidst the
health and wealth of the Dale the rags and misery and nakedness
of the thralls, like a dream amidst the trim gaiety of spring;
and whomsoever they met, or came up with on the road, whatso his
business might be, could not refrain himself from following them,
but mingled with the men-at-arms, and asked them of the tidings;
and when they heard who these poor people were, even delivered
thralls of the Foemen, they were glad at heart and cried out for
joy; and many of the women, nay, of the men also, when they first
came across that misery from out the heart of their own pleasant
life, wept for pity and love of the poor folk, now at last set
free, and blessed the swords that should do the like by the whole
people.
They went slowly as men began to gather about them; yea,  a
name="page217">p. 217some of the
good folk that lived hard by must needs fare home to their houses
to fetch cakes and wine for the guests; and they made them sit
down and rest on the green grass by the side of the Portway, and
eat and drink to cheer their hearts; others, women and young
swains, while they rested went down into the meadows and plucked
of the spring flowers, and twined them hastily with deft and
well-wont fingers into chaplets and garlands for their heads and
bodies.&nbsp; Thus indeed they covered their nakedness, till the
lowering faces and weather-beaten skins of those hardly-entreated
thralls looked grimly out from amidst the knots of cowslip and
oxlip, and the branches of the milk-white blackthorn bloom, and
the long trumpets of the daffodils, of the hue that wrappeth
round the quill which the webster takes in hand when she would
pleasure her soul with the sight of the yellow growing upon the
dark green web.
So they went on again as the evening was waning, and when they
were gotten within a furlong of the Gate, lo! there was come the
minstrelsy, the pipe and the tabor, the fiddle and the harp, and
the folk that had learned to sing the sweetest, both men and
women, and Redesman at the head of them all.
Then fell the throng into an ordered company; first went the
music, and then a score of Face-of-god&rsquo;s warriors with
drawn swords and uplifted spears; and then the flower-bedecked
misery of the Runaways, men and women going together, gaunt,
befouled, and hollow-eyed, with here and there a flushed cheek or
gleaming eye, or tear-bedewed face, as the joy and triumph of the
eve pierced through their wonted weariness of grief; then the
rest of the warriors, and lastly the mingled crowd of Dalesfolk,
tall men and fair women gaily arrayed, clean-faced,
clear-skinned, and sleek-haired, with glancing eyes and ruddy
lips.
And now Redesman turned about to the music and drew his bow
across his fiddle, and the other bows ran out in concert, and the
harps followed the story of them, and he lifted up his voice and
sang the words of an old song, and all the singers joined him  a
name="page218">p. 218and blended
their voices with his.&nbsp; And these are some of the words
which they sang:
Lo! here is Spring, and all we are living, br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We that were wan with Winter&rsquo;s fear;
Reach out your hands to her hands that are giving,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest ye lose her love and the light of the year.
Many a morn did we wake to sorrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp; When low on the land the cloud-wrath lay;
Many an eve we feared to-morrow,
&nbsp;&nbsp; The unbegun unfinished day.
Ah we&mdash;we hoped not, and thou wert
tardy;
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nought wert thou helping; nought we prayed.
Where was the eager heart, the hardy?
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where was the sweet-voiced unafraid?
But now thou lovest, now thou leadest,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is gone the grief of our minds?
What was the word of the tale, that thou heedest
&nbsp;&nbsp; E&rsquo;en as the breath of the bygone winds?
Green and green is thy garment growing
&nbsp;&nbsp; Over thy blossoming limbs beneath;
Up o&rsquo;er our feet rise the blades of thy sowing,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Pierced are our hearts with thine odorous
breath.
But where art thou wending, thou new-comer? br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hurrying on to the Courts of the Sun?
Where art thou now in the House of the Summer?
&nbsp;&nbsp; Told are thy days and thy deed is done.
Spring has been here for us that are living br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; After the days of Winter&rsquo;s fear;
p. 219Here in
our hands is the wealth of her giving,
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Love of the Earth, and the Light of the
Year.
Thus came they to the Gate, and lo! the Bride thereby, leaning
against a buttress, gazing with no dull eyes at the coming
throng.&nbsp; She was now clad in her woman&rsquo;s attire again,
to wit a light flame-coloured gown over a green kirtle; but she
yet bore a gilded helm on her head and a sword girt to her side
in token of her oath to the God.&nbsp; She had been in
Hall-face&rsquo;s company in that last battle, and had done a
man&rsquo;s service there, fighting very valiantly, but had not
been hurt, and had come back to Burgstead when the shift of men
was.
Now she drew herself up and stood a little way before the Gate
and looked forth on the throng, and when her eyes beheld the
Runaways amidst of the weaponed carles of Burgdale, her face
flushed, and her eyes filled with tears as she stood, partly
wondering, partly deeming what they were.&nbsp; She waited till
Stone-face came by her, and then she took the old man by the
sleeve, and drew him apart a little and said to him: &lsquo;What
meaneth this show, my friend?&nbsp; Who hath clad these folk thus
strangely; and who be these three naked tall ones, so
fierce-looking, but somewhat noble of aspect?&rsquo;
For indeed those three men of the kindreds, when they had
gotten into the Dale, and had rested them, and drunk a cup of
wine, and when they had seen the chaplets and wreaths of the
spring-flowers wherewith they were bedecked, and had smelt the
sweet savour of them, fell to walking proudly, heeding not their
nakedness; for no rag had they upon them save breech-clouts of
deer-skin: they had changed weapons with the Burgdale carles; and
one had gotten a great axe, which he bore over his shoulder, and
the shaft thereof was all done about with copper; and another had
shouldered a long heavy thrusting-spear, and the third, an
exceeding tall man, bore a long broad-bladed war-sword.&nbsp;
Thus they went, brown of skin beneath their flower-garlands,
their long hair p.
220bleached by the sun falling about their shoulders; high
they strode amongst the shuffling carles and tripping women of
the later-come thralls.&nbsp; But when they heard the music, and
saw that they were coming to the Gate in triumph, strange
thoughts of old memories swelled up in their hearts, and they
refrained them not from weeping, for they felt that the joy of
life had come back to them.
Nor must it be deemed that these were the only ones amongst
the Runaways whose hearts were cheered and softened: already were
many of them coming back to life, as they felt their worn bodies
caressed by the clear soft air of Burgdale, and the sweetness of
the flowers that hung about them, and saw all round about the
kind and happy faces of their well-willers.
So Stone-face looked on the Bride as she stood with face yet
tear-bedewed, awaiting his answer, and said:
&lsquo;Daughter, thou sayest who clad these folk thus?&nbsp;
It was misery that hath so dight them; and they are the images of
what we shall be if we love foul life better than fair death, and
so fall into the hands of the Felons, who were the masters of
these men.&nbsp; As for the tall naked men, they are of our own
blood, and kinsmen to Face-of-god&rsquo;s new friends; and they
are of the best of the vanquished: it was in early days that they
fled from thralldom; as we may have to do.&nbsp; Now, daughter, I
bid thee be as joyous as thou art valiant, and then shall all be
well.&rsquo;
Therewith she smiled on him, and he departed, and she stood a
little while, as the throng moved on and was swallowed by the
Gate, and looked after them; and for all her pity for the other
folk, she thought chiefly of those fearless tall men who were of
the blood of those with whom it was lawful to wed.
There she stood as the wind dried the tears upon her cheeks,
thinking of the sorrow which these folk had endured, and their
stripes and mocking, their squalor and famine; and she wondered
and looked on her own fair and shapely hands with the precious
finger-rings thereon, and on the dainty cloth and trim broidery
of her sleeve; and she touched her smooth cheek with the back  a
name="page221">p. 221of her
hand, and smiled, and felt the spring sweet in her mouth, and its
savour goodly in her nostrils; and therewith she called to mind
the aspect of her lovely body, as whiles she had seen it imaged,
all its full measure, in the clear pool at midsummer, or
piece-meal, in the shining steel of the Westland mirror.&nbsp;
She thought also with what joy she drew the breath of life, yea,
even amidst of grief, and of how sweet and pure and well-nurtured
she was, and how well beloved of many friends and the whole folk,
and she set all this beside those woeful bodies and lowering
faces, and felt shame of her sorrow of heart, and the pain it had
brought to her; and ever amidst shame and pity of all that misery
rose up before her the images of those tall fierce men, and it
seemed to her as if she had seen something like to them in some
dream or imagination of her mind.
So came the Burgdalers and their guests into the street of
Burgstead amidst music and singing; and the throng was great
there.&nbsp; Then Face-of-god bade make a ring about the
strangers, and they did so, and he and the Runaways alone were in
the midst of it; and he spake in a loud voice and said:
&lsquo;Men of the Dale and the Burg, these folk whom here ye
see in such a sorry plight are they whom our deadly foes have
rejoiced to torment; let us therefore rejoice to cherish
them.&nbsp; Now let those men come forth who deem that they have
enough and more, so that they may each take into their houses
some two or three of these friends such as would be fain to be
together.&nbsp; And since I am War-leader, and have the right
hereto, I will first choose them whom I will lead into the House
of the Face.&nbsp; And lo you! will I have this man (and he laid
his hand on Dallach),who is he whom I first came across, and who
found us all these others, and next I will have yonder tall
carles, the three of them, because I perceive them to be men meet
to be with a War-leader, and to follow him in battle.&rsquo;
Therewith he drew the three Men of the Wolf towards him, but
Dallach already was standing beside him.&nbsp; And folk rejoiced
in Face-of-god.
p. 222But
the Bride came forward next, and spake to him meekly and
simply:
&lsquo;War-leader, let me have of the women those who need me
most, that I may bring them to the House of the Steer, and try if
there be not some good days yet to be found for them, wherein
they shall but remember the past grief as an ugly
dream.&rsquo;
Then Face-of-god looked on her, and him-seemed he had never
seen her so fair; and all the shame wherewith he had beheld her
of late was gone from him, and his heart ran over with friendly
love towards her as she looked into his face with kindly eyes;
and he said:
&lsquo;Kinswoman, take thy choice as thy kindness biddeth, and
happy shall they be whom thou choosest.&rsquo;
She bowed her head soberly, and chose from among the guests
four women of the saddest and most grievous, and no man of their
kindred spake for going along with them; then she went her ways
home, leading one of them by the hand, and strange was it to see
those twain going through sun and shade together, that poor
wretch along with the goodliest of women.
Then came forward one after other of the worthy goodmen of the
Dale, and especially such as were old, and they led away one one
man, and another two, and another three, and often would a man
crave to go with a woman or a woman with a man, and it was not
gainsaid them.&nbsp; So were all the guests apportioned, and
ill-content were those goodmen that had to depart without a
guest; and one man would say to another: &lsquo;Such-an-one, be
not downcast; this guest shall be between us, if he will, and
shall dwell with thee and me month about; but this first month
with me, since I was first comer.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so forth was
it said.
Now to prevent the time to come, it may be said about the
Runaways, that when they had been a little while amongst the
Burgdalers, well fed and well clad and kindly cherished, it was
marvellous how they were bettered in aspect of body, and it began
p. 223to be
seen of them that they were well-favoured people, and divers of
the women exceeding goodly, black-haired and grey-eyed, and very
clear-skinned and white-skinned; most of them were young, and the
oldest had not seen above forty winters.&nbsp; They of Rose-dale,
and especially such as had first fled away to the wood, were very
soon seen to be merry and kindly folk; but they who had been
longest in captivity, and notably those from Silver-dale who were
not of the kindreds, were for a long time sullen and heavy, and
it availed little to trust to them for the doing of work; albeit
they would follow about their friends of Burgdale with the love
of a dog; also they were, divers of them, somewhat thievish, and
if they lacked anything would liefer take it by stealth than ask
for it; which forsooth the Burgdale men took not amiss, but
deemed of it as a jest rather.
Very few of the Runaways had any will to fare back to their
old homes, or indeed could be got to go into the wood, or, after
a day or two, to say any word of Rose-dale or Silver-dale.&nbsp;
In this and other matters the Burgdalers dealt with them as with
children who must have their way; for they deemed that their
guests had much time to make up; also they were well content when
they saw how goodly they were, for these Dalesmen loved to see
men goodly of body and of a cheerful countenance.
As for Dallach and the three Silver-dale men of the kindred,
they went gladly whereas the Burgdale men would have them; and
half a score others took weapons in their hands when the war was
foughten: concerning which more hereafter.
But on the even whereof the tale now tells, Face-of-god and
Stone-face and their company met after nightfall in the Hall of
the Face clad in glorious raiment, and therewith were Dallach and
the men of Silver-dale, washen and docked of their long hair,
after the fashion of warriors who bear the helm; and they were
clad in gay attire, with battle-swords girt to their sides and
gold rings on their arms.&nbsp; Somewhat stern and sad-eyed were
those Silver-dalers yet, though they looked on those about them
kindly p.
224and courteously when they met their eyes; and
Face-of-god yearned towards them when he called to mind the
beauty and wisdom and loving-kindness of the Sun-beam.&nbsp; They
were, as aforesaid, strong men and tall, and one of them taller
than any amidst that house of tall men.&nbsp; Their names were
Wolf-stone, the tallest, and God-swain, and Spear-fist; and
God-swain the youngest was of thirty winters, and Wolf-stone of
forty.&nbsp; They came into the Hall in such wise, that when they
were washed and attired, and all men were assembled in the Hall,
and the Alderman and the chieftains sitting on the da&iuml;s,
Face-of-god brought them in from the out-bower, holding Dallach
by the right hand and Wolf-stone by the left; and he looked but a
stripling beside that huge man.
And when the men in the Hall beheld such goodly warriors, and
remembered their grief late past, they all stood up and shouted
for joy of them.&nbsp; But Face-of-god passed up the Hall with
them, and stood before the da&iuml;s and said:
&lsquo;O Alderman of the Dale and Chief of the House of the
Face, here I bring to you the foes of our foemen, whom I have met
in the Wild-wood, and bidden to our House; and meseemeth they
will be our friends, and stand beside us in the day of
battle.&nbsp; Therefore I say, take these guests and me together,
or put us all to the door together; and if thou wilt take them,
then show them to such places as thou deemest meet.&rsquo;
Then stood up the Alderman and said:
&lsquo;Men of Silver-dale and Rose-dale, I bid you
welcome!&nbsp; Be ye our friends, and abide here with us as long
as seemeth good to you, and share in all that is ours.&nbsp; Son
Face-of-god, show these warriors to seats on the da&iuml;s beside
thee, and cherish them as well as thou knowest how.&rsquo;
Then Face-of-god brought them up on to the da&iuml;s and sat
down on the right hand of his father, with Dallach on his right
hand, and then Wolf-stone out from him; then sat Stone-face, that
there might be a man of the Dale to talk with them and  a
name="page225">p. 225serve them;
and on his right hand first Spear-fist and then God-swain.&nbsp;
And when they were all sat down, and the meat was on the board,
Iron-face turned to his son Face-of-god and took his hand, and
said in a loud voice, so that many might hear him:
&lsquo;Son Face-of-god, son Gold-mane, thou bearest with thee
both ill luck and good.&nbsp; Erewhile, when thou wanderedst out
into the Wild-wood, seeking thou knewest not what from out of the
Land of Dreams, thou didst but bring aback to us grief and shame;
but now that thou hast gone forth with the neighbours seeking thy
foemen, thou hast come aback to us with thine hands full of
honour and joy for us, and we thank thee for thy gifts, and I
call thee a lucky man.&nbsp; Herewith, kinsman, I drink to thee
and the lasting of thy luck.&rsquo;
Therewith he stood up and drank the health of the War-leader
and the Guests: and all men were exceeding joyous thereat, when
they called to mind his wrath at the Gate-thing, and they shouted
for gladness as they drank that health, and the feast became
exceeding merry in the House of the Face; and as to the war to
come, it seemed to them as if it were over and done in all
triumph.
CHAPTER XXX.&nbsp; HALL-FACE GOETH TOWARD ROSE-DALE.
On the morrow Face-of-god took
counsel with Hall-face and Stone-face as to what were best to be
done, and they sat on the da&iuml;s in the Hall to talk it
over.
Short was the time that had worn since that day in Shadowy
Vale, for it was but eight days since then; yet so many things
had befallen in that time, and, to speak shortly, the outlook for
the Burgdalers had changed so much, that the time seemed long to
all the three, and especially to Face-of-god.
It was yet twenty days till the Great Folk-mote should
beholden, p.
226and to Hall-face the time seemed long enough to do
somewhat, and he deemed it were good to gather force and fall on
the Dusky Men in Rose-dale, since now they had gotten men who
could lead them the nighest way and by the safest passes, and who
knew all the ways of the foemen.&nbsp; But to Stone-face this
rede seemed not so good; for they would have to go and come back,
and fight and conquer, in less time than twenty days, or be
belated of the Folk-mote, and meanwhile much might happen.
&lsquo;For,&rsquo; said Stone-face, &lsquo;we may deem the
fighting-men of Rose-dale to be little less than one thousand,
and however we fall on them, even if it be unawares at first,
they shall fight stubbornly; so that we may not send against them
many less than they be, and that shall strip Burgdale of its
fighting-men, so that whatever befalls, we that be left shall
have to bide at home.&rsquo;
Now was Face-of-god of the same mind as Stone-face; and he
said moreover: &lsquo;When we go to Rose-dale we must abide there
a while unless we be overthrown.&nbsp; For if ye conquer it and
come away at once, presently shall the tidings come to the ears
of the Dusky Men in Silver-dale, and they shall join themselves
to those of Rose-dale who have fled before you, and between them
they shall destroy the unhappy people therein; for ye cannot take
them all away with you: and that shall they do all the more now,
when they look to have new thralls in Burgdale, both men and
women.&nbsp; And this we may not suffer, but must abide till we
have met all our foemen and have overcome them, so that the poor
folk there shall be safe from them till they have learned how to
defend their dale.&nbsp; Now my rede is, that we send out the
War-arrow at once up and down the Dale, and to the Shepherds and
Woodlanders, and appoint a day for the Muster and Weapon-show of
all our Folk, and that day to be the day before the Spring
Market, that is to say, four days before the Great Folk-mote, and
meantime that we keep sure watch about the border of the wood,
and now and again scour the wood, so as to clear the Dale of
their wandering bands.&rsquo;
p.
227&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said Hall-face; &lsquo;and I pray
thee, brother, let me have an hundred of men and thy Dallach, and
let us go somewhat deep into the wood towards Rose-dale, and see
what we may come across; peradventure it might be something
better than hart or wild-swine.&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;I see no harm therein, if Dallach
goeth with thee freely; for I will have no force put on him or
any other of the Runaways.&nbsp; Yet meseemeth it were not ill
for thee to find the road to Rose-dale; for I have it in my mind
to send a company thither to give those Rose-dale man-quellers
somewhat to do at home when we fall upon Silver-dale.&nbsp;
Therefore go find Dallach, and get thy men together at once; for
the sooner thou art gone on thy way the better.&nbsp; But this I
bid thee, go no further than three days out, that ye may be back
home betimes.&rsquo;
At this word Hall-face&rsquo;s eyes gleamed with joy, and he
went out from the Hall straightway and sought Dallach, and found
him at the Gate.&nbsp; Iron-face had given him a new sword, a
good one, and had bidden him call it Thicket-clearer, and he
would not leave it any moment of the day or night, but would lay
it under his pillow at night as a child does with a new toy; and
now he was leaning against a buttress and drawing the said sword
half out of the scabbard and poring over its blade, which was
indeed fair enough, being wrought with dark grey waving lines
like the eddies of the Weltering Water.
So Hall-face greeted him, and smiled and said:
&lsquo;Guest, if thou wilt, thou may&rsquo;st take that new
blade of my father&rsquo;s work which thou lovest so, a journey
which shall rejoice it.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said Dallach, &lsquo;I suppose that thou
wouldest fare on thy brother&rsquo;s footsteps, and deemest that
I am the man to lead thee on the road, and even farther than he
went; and though it might be thought by some that I have seen
enough of Rose-dale and the parts thereabout for one while, yet
will I go with thee; for now am I a man again, body and
soul.&rsquo;
And therewith he drew Thicket-clearer right out of his sheath
p. 228and
waved him in the air.&nbsp; And Hall-face was glad of him and
said he was well apaid of his help.&nbsp; So they went away
together to gather men, and on the morrow Hall-face departed and
went into the Wild-wood with Dallach and an hundred and two score
men.
But as for Face-of-god, he fared up and down the Dale
following the War-arrow, and went into all houses, and talked
with the folk, both young and old, men and women, and told them
closely all that had betid and all that was like to betide; and
he was well pleased with that which he saw and heard; for all
took his words well, and were nought afeard or dismayed by the
tidings; and he saw that they would not hang aback.&nbsp;
Meantime the days wore, and Hall-face came not back till the
seventh day, and he brought with him twelve more Runaways, of
whom five were women.&nbsp; But he had lost four men, and had
with him Dallach and five others of the Dalesmen borne upon
litters sore hurt; and this was his story:
They got to the Burg of the Runaways on the forenoon of the
third day, and thereby came on five carles of the
Runaways&mdash;men who had missed meeting Dallach that other day,
but knew what had been done; for one of them had been sick and
could not come with him, and he had told the others: so now they
were hanging about the Burg of the Runaways hoping somewhat that
he might come again; and they met the Burgdalers full of joy, and
brought them trouts that they had caught in the river.
As for the other runaways, namely, five women and two more
carles&mdash;they had gotten them close to the entrance into
Silver-dale, where by night and cloud they came on a campment of
the Dusky Men, who were leading home these seven poor wretches,
runaways whom they had caught, that they might slay them most
evilly in Rose-stead.&nbsp; So Hall-face fell on the Dusky Men,
and delivered their captives, but slew not all the foe, and they
that fled brought pursuers on them who came up with them the next
day, so near was Rose-dale, though they made all diligence
homeward.&nbsp; The  span
class="pagenum">p. 229Burgdalers must needs turn and fight
with those pursuers, and at last they drave them aback so that
they might go on their ways home.&nbsp; They let not the grass
grow beneath their feet thereafter, till they were assured by
meeting a band of the Woodlanders, who had gone forth to help
them, and with whom they rested a little.&nbsp; But neither so
were they quite done with the foemen, who came upon them next day
a very many: these however they and the Woodlanders, who were all
fresh and unwounded and very valiant, speedily put to the worse;
and so they came on to Burgstead, leaving those of them who were
sorest hurt to be tended by the Woodlanders at Carlstead, who, as
might be looked for, deal with them very lovingly.
It was in the first fight that they suffered that loss of
slain and wounded; and therein the newly delivered thralls fought
valiantly against their masters: as for Dallach, it was no
marvel, said Hall-face, that he was hurt; but rather a marvel
that he was not slain, so little he recked of point and edge, if
he might but slay the foemen.
Such was Hall-face&rsquo;s-tale; and Face-of-god deemed that
he had done unwisely to let him go that journey; for the slaying
of a few Dusky Men was but a light gain to set against the loss
of so many Burgdalers; yet was he glad of the deliverance of
those Runaways, and deemed it a gain indeed.&nbsp; But henceforth
would he hold all still till he should have tidings of
Folk-might; so nought was done thereafter save the warding of the
Dale, from the country of the Shepherds to the Waste above the
Eastern passes.
But Face-of-god himself went up amongst the Shepherds, and
abode with a goodman hight Hound-under-Greenbury, who gathered to
him the folk from the country-side, and they went up on to
Greenbury, and sat on the green grass while he spoke with them
and told them, as he had told the others, what had been done and
what should be done.&nbsp; And they heard him gladly, and he
deemed that there would be no blenching in them, for they were
all in one tale to live and die with their friends of Burgdale,
p. 230and they
said that they would have no other word save that to bear to the
Great Folk-mote.
So he went away well-pleased, and he fared on thence to the
Woodlanders, and guested at the house of a valiant man hight
Wargrove, who on the morrow morn called the folk together to a
green lawn of the Wild-wood, so that there was scarce a soul of
them that was not there.&nbsp; Then he laid the whole matter
before them; and if the Dalesmen had been merry and ready, and
the Shepherds stout-hearted and friendly, yet were the
Wood-landers more eager still, so that every hour seemed long to
them till they stood in their war-gear; and they told him that
now at last was the hour drawing nigh which they had dreamed of,
but had scarce dared to hope for, when the lost way should be
found, and the crooked made straight, and that which had been
broken should be mended; that their meat and drink, and sleeping
and waking, and all that they did were now become to them but the
means of living till the day was come whereon the two remnants of
the children of the Wolf should meet and become one Folk to live
or die together.
Then went Face-of-god back to Burgstead again, and as he stood
anigh the Thing-stead once more, and looked down on the Dale as
he had beheld it last autumn, he bethought him that with all that
had been done and all that had been promised, the earth was
clearing of her trouble, and that now there was nought betwixt
him and the happy days of life which the Dale should give to the
dwellers therein, save the gathering hosts of the battle-field
and the day when the last word should be spoken and the first
stroke smitten.&nbsp; So he went down on to the Portway well
content.
Thereafter till the day of the Weapon-show there is nought to
tell of, save that Dallach and the other wounded men began to
grow whole again; and all men sat at home, or went on the
woodland ward, expecting great tidings after the holding of the
Folk-mote.
p.
231CHAPTER XXXI.&nbsp; OF THE WEAPON-SHOW OF THE MEN OF
BURGDALE AND THEIR NEIGHBOURS.
Now on the day appointed for the
Weapon-show came the Folk flock-meal to the great and wide meadow
that was cleft by Wildlake as it ran to join the Weltering
Water.&nbsp; Early in the morning, even before sunrise, had the
wains full of women and children begun to come thither.&nbsp;
Also there came little horses and asses from the Shepherd country
with one or two or three damsels or children sitting on each, and
by wain-side or by beast strode the men of the house, merry and
fair in their war-gear.&nbsp; The Woodlanders, moreover, man and
woman, elder and swain and young damsel, streamed out of the wood
from Carlstead, eager to make the day begin before the sunrise,
and end before his setting.
Then all men fell to pitching of tents and tilting over of
wains; for the April sun was hot in the Dale, and when he arose
the meads were gay with more than the spring flowers; for the
tents and the tilts were stained and broidered with many colours,
and there was none who had not furbished up his war-gear so that
all shone and glittered.&nbsp; And many wore gay surcoats over
their armour, and the women were clad in all their bravery, and
the Houses mostly of a suit; for one bore blue and another
corn-colour, and another green, and another brazil, and so forth,
and all gleaming and glowing with broidery of gold and bright
hues.&nbsp; But the women of the Shepherds were all clad in
white, embroidered with green boughs and red blossoms, and the
Woodland women wore dark red kirtles.&nbsp; Moreover, the women
had set garlands of flowers on their heads and the helms of the
men, and for the most part they were slim of body and tall and
light-limbed, and as dainty to look upon as the willow-boughs
that waved on the brook-side.
Thither had the goodmen who were guesting the Runaways brought
their guests, even now much bettered by their new soft days; and
much the poor folk marvelled at all this joyance, and  a
name="page232">p. 232they scarce
knew where they were; but to some it brought back to their minds
days of joyance before the thralldom and all that they had lost,
so that their hearts were heavy a while, till they saw the
warriors of the kindreds streaming into the mead and bethought
them why they carried steel.
Now by then the sun was fully up there was a great throng on
the Portway, and this was the folk of the Burg on their way to
the Weapon-mead.&nbsp; The men-at-arms were in the midst of the
throng, and at the head of them was the War-leader, with the
banner of the Face before him, wherein was done the image of the
God with the ray-ringed head.&nbsp; But at the rearward of the
warriors went the Alderman and the Burg-wardens, before whom was
borne the banner of the Burg pictured with the Gate and its
Towers; but in the midst betwixt those two was the banner of the
Steer, a white beast on a green field.
So when the Dale-wardens who were down in the meadow heard the
music and beheld who were coming, they bade the companies of the
Dale and the Shepherds and the Woodlanders who were down there to
pitch their banners in a half circle about the ingle of the
meadow which was made by the streams of Wildlake and the
Weltering Water, and gather to them to be ordered there under
their leaders of scores and half-hundreds and hundreds; and even
so they did.&nbsp; But the banners of the Dale without the Burg
were the Bridge, and the Bull, and the Vine, and the
Sickle.&nbsp; And the Shepherds had three banners, to wit
Greenbury, and the Fleece, and the Thorn.
As for the Woodlanders, they said that they were abiding their
great banner, but it should come in good time; &lsquo;and
meantime,&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;here are the war-tokens that
we shall fight under; for they are good enough banners for us
poor men, the remnant of the valiant of time past.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Therewith they showed two great spears, and athwart the one was
tied an arrow, its point dipped in blood, its feathers singed
with fire; and they said, &lsquo;This is the banner of the
War-shaft.&rsquo;
p. 233On
the other spear there was nought; but the head thereof was great
and long, and they had so burnished the steel that the sun smote
out a ray of light from it, so that it might be seen from
afar.&nbsp; And they said: &lsquo;This is the Banner of the
Spear!&nbsp; Down yonder where the ravens are gathering ye shall
see a banner flying over us.&nbsp; There shall fall many a
mother&rsquo;s son.&rsquo;
Smiled the Dale-wardens, and said that these were good banners
to fight under; and those that stood nearby shouted for the
valiancy of the Woodland Carles.
Now the Dale-wardens went to the entrance from the Portway to
the meadow, and there met the Men of the Burg, and two of them
went one on either side of the War-leader to show him to his
seat, and the others abode till the Alderman and Burg-wardens
came up, and then joined themselves to them, and the horns blew
up both in the meadow and on the road, and the new-comers went
their ways to their appointed places amidst the shouts of the
Dalesmen; and the women and children and old men from the Burg
followed after, till all the mead was covered with bright raiment
and glittering gear, save within the ring of men at the further
end.
So came the War-leader to his seat of green turf raised in the
ingle aforesaid; and he stood beside it till the Alderman and
Wardens had taken their places on a seat behind him raised higher
than his; below him on the step of his seat sat the Scrivener
with his pen and ink-horn and scroll of parchment, and men had
brought him a smooth shield whereon to write.
On the left side of Face-of-god stood the men of the Face all
glittering in their arms, and amongst them were Wolf-stone and
his two fellows, but Dallach was not yet whole of his
hurts.&nbsp; On his right were the folk of the House of the
Steer: the leader of that House was an old white-bearded man,
grandfather of the Bride, for her father was dead; and who but
the Bride herself stood beside him in her glorious war-gear,
looking as if she were new come from the City of the Gods,
thought most men; but  span
class="pagenum">p. 234those who beheld her closely deemed
that she looked heavy-eyed and haggard, as if she were
aweary.&nbsp; Nevertheless, wheresoever she passed, and whosoever
looked on her (and all men looked on her), there arose a murmur
of praise and love; and the women, and especially the young ones,
said how fair her deed was, and how meet she was for it; and some
of them were for doing on war-gear and faring to battle with the
carles; and of these some were sober and solemn, as was well seen
afterwards, and some spake lightly: some also fell to boasting of
how they could run and climb and swim and shoot in the bow, and
fell to baring of their arms to show how strong they were: and
indeed they were no weaklings, though their arms were fair.
There then stood the ring of men, each company under its
banner; and beyond them stood the women and children and men
unmeet for battle; and beyond them again the tilted wains and the
tents.
Now Face-of-god sat him down on the turf-seat with his bright
helm on his head and his naked sword across his knees, while the
horns blew up loudly, and when they had done, the elder of the
Dale-wardens cried out for silence.&nbsp; Then again arose
Face-of-god and said:
&lsquo;Men of the Dale, and ye friends of the Shepherds, and
ye, O valiant Woodlanders; we are not assembled here to take
counsel, for in three days&rsquo; time shall the Great Folk-mote
be holden, whereat shall be counsel enough.&nbsp; But since I
have been appointed your Chief and War-leader, till such time as
the Folk-mote shall either yeasay or naysay my leadership, I have
sent for you that we may look each other in the face and number
our host and behold our weapons, and see if we be meet for battle
and for the dealing with a great host of foemen.&nbsp; For now no
longer can it be said that we are going to war, but rather that
war is on our borders, and we are blended with it; as many have
learned to their cost; for some have been slain and some sorely
hurt.&nbsp; Therefore I bid you now, all ye that are weaponed,
wend past us p.
235that the tale of you may be taken.&nbsp; But first let
every hundred-leader and half-hundred-leader and score-leader
make sure that he hath his tale aright, and give his word to the
captain of his banner that he in turn may give it out to the
Scrivener with his name and the House and Company that he
leadeth.&rsquo;
So he spake and sat him adown; and the horns blew again in
token that the companies should go past; and the first that came
was Hall-ward of the House of the Steer, and the first of those
that went after him was the Bride, going as if she were his
son.
So he cried out his name, and the name of his House, and said,
&lsquo;An hundred and a half,&rsquo; and passed forth, his men
following him in most goodly array.&nbsp; Each man was girt with
a good sword and bore a long heavy spear over his shoulder, save
a score who bare bows; and no man lacked a helm, a shield, and a
coat of fence.
Then came a goodly man of thirty winters, and stayed before
the Scrivener and cried out:
&lsquo;Write down the House of the Bridge of the Upper Dale at
one hundred, and War-well their leader.&rsquo;
And he strode on, and his men followed clad and weaponed like
those of the Steer, save that some had axes hanging to their
girdles instead of swords; and most bore casting-spears instead
of the long spears, and half a score were bowmen.
Then came Fox of Upton leading the men of the Bull of Middale,
an hundred and a half lacking two; very great and tall were his
men, and they also bore long spears, and one score and two were
bowmen.
Then Fork-beard of Lea, a man well on in years, led on the men
of the Vine, an hundred and a half and five men thereto; two
score of them bare bow in hand and were girt with sword; the rest
bore their swords naked in their right hands, and their shields
(which were but small bucklers) hanging at their backs, and in
the left hand each bore two casting-spears.&nbsp; With these went
two doughty women-at-arms among the bowmen, tall and well-knit,
already growing brown with the spring sun, for their  a
name="page236">p. 236work lay
among the stocks of the vines on the southward-looking bents.
Next came a tall young man, yellow-haired, with a thin red
beard, and gave himself out for Red-beard of the Knolls; he bore
his father&rsquo;s name, as the custom of their house was, but
the old man, who had long been head man of the House of the
Sickle, was late dead in his bed, and the young man had not seen
twenty winters.&nbsp; He bade the Scrivener write the tale of the
Men of the Sickle at an hundred and a half, and his folk fared
past the War-leader joyously, being one half of them bowmen; and
fell shooters they were; the other half were girt with swords,
and bore withal long ashen staves armed with great blades curved
inwards, which weapon they called heft-sax.
All these bands, as the name and the tale of them was declared
were greeted with loud shouts from their fellows and the
bystanders; but now arose a greater shout still, as Stone-face,
clad in goodly glittering array, came forth and said:
&lsquo;I am Stone-face of the House of the Face, and I bring
with me two hundreds of men with their best war-gear and weapons:
write it down, Scrivener!&rsquo;
And he strode on like a young man after those who had gone
past, and after him came the tall Hall-face and his men, a
gallant sight to see: two score bowmen girt with swords, and the
others with naked swords waving aloft, and each bearing two
casting-spears in his left hand.
Then came a man of middle age, broad-shouldered,
yellow-haired, blue-eyed, of wide and ruddy countenance, and
after him a goodly company; and again great was the shout that
went up to the heavens; for he said:
&lsquo;Scrivener, write down that Hound-under-Greenbury, from
amongst the dwellers in the hills where the sheep feed, leadeth
the men who go under the banner of Greenbury, to the tale of an
hundred and four score.&rsquo;
Therewith he passed on, and his men followed, stout, stark,  a
name="page237">p. 237and
merry-faced, girt with swords, and bearing over their shoulders
long-staved axes, and spears not so long as those which the
Dalesmen bore; and they had but a half score of arrow-shot with
them.
Next came a young man, blue-eyed also, with hair the colour of
flax on the distaff, broad-faced and short-nosed, low of stature,
but very strong-built, who cried out in a loud, cheerful
voice:
&lsquo;I am Strongitharm of the Shepherds, and these valiant
men are of the Fleece and the Thorn blended together, for so they
would have it; and their tale is one hundred and two score and
ten.&rsquo;
Then the men of those kindreds went past merry and shouting,
and they were clad and weaponed like to them of Greenbury, but
had with them a score of bowmen.&nbsp; And all these
Shepherd-folk wore over their hauberks white woollen surcoats
broidered with green and red.
Now again uprose the cry, and there stood before the
War-leader a very tall man of fifty winters, dark-faced and
grey-eyed, and he spake slowly and somewhat softly, and said:
&lsquo;War-leader, this is Red-wolf of the Woodlanders leading
the men who go under the sign of the War-shaft, to the number of
an hundred and two.&rsquo;
Then he passed on, and his men after him, tall, lean, and
silent amidst the shouting.&nbsp; All these men bare bows, for
they were keen hunters; each had at his girdle a little axe and a
wood-knife, and some had long swords withal.&nbsp; They wore,
everyone of the carles, short green surcoats over their coats of
fence; but amongst them were three women who bore like weapons to
the men, but were clad in red kirtles under their hauberks, which
were of good ring-mail gleaming over them from throat to
knee.
Last came another tall man, but young, of twenty-five winters,
and spake:
&lsquo;Scrivener, I am Bears-bane of the Woodlanders, and
these that come after me wend under the sign of the Spear, and
they are of the tale of one hundred and seven.&rsquo;
p. 238And
he passed by at once, and his men followed him, clad and weaponed
no otherwise than they of the War-shaft, and with them were two
women.
Now went all those companies back to their banners, and stood
there; and there arose among the bystanders much talk concerning
the Weapon-show, and who were the best arrayed of the
Houses.&nbsp; And of the old men, some spake of past weapon-shows
which they had seen in their youth, and they set them beside this
one, and praised and blamed.&nbsp; So it went on a little while
till the horns blew again, and once more there was silence.&nbsp;
Then arose Face-of-god and said:
&lsquo;Men of Burgdale, and ye Shepherd-folk, and ye of the
Woodland, now shall ye wot how many weaponed men we may bring
together for this war.&nbsp; Scrivener, arise and give forth the
tale of the companies, as they have been told unto
you.&rsquo;
Then the Scrivener stood up on the turf-bench beside
Face-of-god, and spake in a loud voice, reading from his
scroll:
&lsquo;Of the Men of Burgdale there have passed by me nine
hundreds and six; of the Shepherds three hundreds and eight and
ten; and of the Woodlanders two hundreds and nine; so that all
told our men are fourteen hundreds and thirty and
three.&rsquo;
Now in those days men reckoned by long hundreds, so that the
whole tale of the host was one thousand, five hundred, and four
score and one, telling the tale in short hundreds.
When the tale had been given forth and heard, men shouted
again, and they rejoiced that they were so many.&nbsp; For it
exceeded the reckoning which the Alderman had given out at the
Gate-thing.&nbsp; But Face-of-god said:
&lsquo;Neighbours, we have held our Weapon-show; but now hold
you ready, each man, for the Hosting toward very battle; for
belike within seven days shall the leaders of hundreds and
twenties summon you to be ready in arms to take whatso fortune
may befall.&nbsp; Now is sundered the Weapon-show.&nbsp; Be ye as
merry to-day as your hearts bid you to be.&rsquo;
p.
239Therewith he came down from his seat with the Alderman
and the Wardens, and they mingled with the good folk of the Dale
and the Shepherds and the Woodlanders, and merry was their
converse there.&nbsp; It yet lacked an hour of noon; so presently
they fell to and feasted in the green meadow, drinking from wain
to wain and from tent to tent; and thereafter they played and
sported in the meads, shooting at the butts and wrestling, and
trying other masteries.&nbsp; Then they fell to dancing one and
all, and so at last to supper on the green grass in great
merriment.&nbsp; Nor might you have known from the demeanour of
any that any threat of evil overhung the Dale.&nbsp; Nay, so glad
were they, and so friendly, that you might rather have deemed
that this was the land whereof tales tell, wherein people die
not, but live for ever, without growing any older than when they
first come thither, unless they be born into the land itself, and
then they grow into fair manhood, and so abide.&nbsp; In sooth,
both the land and the folk were fair enough to be that land and
the folk thereof.
But a little after sunset they sundered, and some fared home;
but many of them abode in the tents and tilted wains, because the
morrow was the first day of the Spring Market: and already were
some of the Westland chapmen come; yea, two of them were with the
bystanders in the meadow; and more were looked for ere the night
was far spent.
CHAPTER XXXII.&nbsp; THE MEN OF SHADOWY VALE COME TO THE
SPRING MARKET AT BURGSTEAD.
On the morrow betimes in the
morning the Westland chapmen, who were now all come, went out
from the House of the Face, where they were ever wont to be
lodged, and set up their booths adown the street betwixt gate and
bridge.&nbsp; Gay was the show; for the booths were tilted over
with painted cloths, and the merchants themselves were clad in
long gowns of p.
240fine cloth; scarlet, and blue, and white, and green,
and black, with broidered welts of gold and silver; and their
knaves were gaily attired in short coats of divers hues, with
silver rings about their arms, and short swords girt to their
sides.&nbsp; People began to gather about these chapmen at once
when they fell to opening their bales and their packs, and
unloading their wains.&nbsp; There had they iron, both in pigs
and forged scrap and nails; steel they had, and silver, both in
ingots and vessel; pearls from over sea; cinnabar and other
colours for staining, such as were not in the mountains: madder
from the marshes, and purple of the sea, and scarlet grain from
the holm-oaks by its edge, and woad from the deep clayey fields
of the plain; silken thread also from the outer ocean, and rare
webs of silk, and jars of olive oil, and fine pottery, and
scented woods, and sugar of the cane.&nbsp; But gold they had
none with them, for that they took there; and for weapons, save a
few silver-gilt toys, they had no market.
So presently they fell to chaffer; for the carles brought them
little bags of the river-borne gold, so that the weights and
scales were at work; others had with them scrolls and tallies to
tell the number of the beasts which they had to sell, and the
chapmen gave them wares therefor without beholding the beasts;
for they wotted that the Dalesmen lied not in chaffer.&nbsp;
While the day was yet young withal came the Dalesmen from the mid
and nether Dale with their wares and set up their booths; and
they had with them flasks and kegs of the wine which they had to
sell; and bales of the good winter-woven cloth, some grey, some
dyed, and pieces of fine linen; and blades of swords, and knives,
and axes of such fashion as the Westland men used; and golden
cups and chains, and fair rings set with mountain-blue stones,
and copper bowls, and vessels gilt and parcel-gilt, and
mountain-blue for staining.&nbsp; There were men of the Shepherds
also with such fleeces as they could spare from the daily chaffer
with the neighbours.&nbsp; And of the Woodlanders were four
carles and a woman with peltries and dressed deer-skins, and a
few pieces p.
241of well-carven wood-work for bedsteads and chairs and
such like.
Soon was the Burg thronged with folk in all its open places,
and all were eager and merry, and it could not have been told
from their demeanour and countenance that the shadow of a
grievous trouble hung over them.&nbsp; True it was that every man
of the Dale and the neighbours was girt with his sword, or bore
spear or axe or other weapon in his hand, and that most had their
bucklers at their backs and their helms on their heads; but this
was ever their custom at all meetings of men, not because they
dreaded war or were fain of strife, but in token that they were
free men, from whom none should take the weapons without
battle.
Such were the folk of the land: as for the chapmen, they were
well-spoken and courteous, and blithe with the folk, as they well
might be, for they had good pennyworths of them; yet they dealt
with them without using measureless lying, as behoved folk
dealing with simple and proud people; and many was the tale they
told of the tidings of the Cities and the Plain.
There amongst the throng was the Bride in her maiden&rsquo;s
attire, but girt with the sword, going from booth to booth with
her guests of the Runaways, and doing those poor people what
pleasure she might, and giving them gifts from the goods there,
such as they set their hearts on.&nbsp; And the more part of the
Runaways were about among the people of the Fair; but Dallach,
being still weak, sat on a bench by the door of the House of the
Face looking on well-pleased at all the stir of folk.
Hall-face was gone on the woodland ward; while Face-of-god
went among the folk in his most glorious attire; but he soon
betook him to the place of meeting without the Gate, where
Stone-face and some of the elders were sitting along with the
Alderman, beside whom sat the head man of the merchants, clad in
a gown of fine scarlet embroidered with the best work of the
Dale, with a golden chaplet on his head, and a good sword,
golden-hilted, by his side, all which the Alderman had given to
it p. 242him
that morning.&nbsp; These chiefs were talking together concerning
the tidings of the Plain, and many a tale the guest told to the
Dalesmen, some true, some false.&nbsp; For there had been battles
down there, and the fall of kings, and destruction of people, as
oft befalleth in the guileful Cities.&nbsp; He told them also, in
answer to their story of the Dusky Men, of how men even
such-like, but riding on horses, or drawn in wains, an host not
to be numbered, had erewhile overthrown the hosts of the Cities
of the Plain, and had wrought evils scarce to be told of; and how
they had piled up the skulls of slaughtered folk into great hills
beside the city-gates, so that the sun might no longer shine into
the streets; and how because of the death and the rapine, grass
had grown in the kings&rsquo; chambers, and the wolves had chased
deer in the Temples of the Gods.
&lsquo;But,&rsquo; quoth he, &lsquo;I know you, bold tillers
of the soil, valiant scourers of the Wild-wood, that the worst
that can befall you will be to die under shield, and that ye
shall suffer no torment of the thrall.&nbsp; May the undying Gods
bless the threshold of this Gate, and oft may I come hither to
taste of your kindness!&nbsp; May your race, the uncorrupt,
increase and multiply, till your valiant men and clean maidens
make the bitter sweet and purify the earth!&rsquo;
He spake smooth-tongued and smiling, handling the while the
folds of his fine scarlet gown, and belike he meant a full half
of what he said; for he was a man very eloquent of speech, and
had spoken with kings, uncowed and pleased with his speaking; and
for that cause and his riches had he been made chief of the
chapmen.&nbsp; As he spake the heart of Face-of-god swelled
within him, and his cheek flushed; but Iron-face sat up straight
and proud, and a light smile played about his face, as he said
gravely:
&lsquo;Friend of the Westland, I thank thee for the blessing
and the kind word.&nbsp; Such as we are, we are; nor do I deem
that the very Gods shall change us.&nbsp; And if they will be our
friends, it is well; for we desire nought of them save their
friendship; and if they will be our foes, that also shall we
bear; nor will we curse them for  span
class="pagenum">p. 243doing that which their lives bid
them to do.&nbsp; What sayest thou, Face-of-god, my
son?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, father,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;I say that
the very Gods, though they slay me, cannot unmake my life that
has been.&nbsp; If they do deeds, yet shall we also
do.&rsquo;
The Outlander smiled as they spake, and bowed his head to
Iron-face and Face-of-god, and wondered at their pride of heart,
marvelling what they would say to the great men of the Cities if
they should meet them.
But as they sat a-talking, there came two men running to them
from the Portway, their weapons all clattering upon them, and
they heard withal the sound of a horn winded not far off very
loud and clear; and the Chapman&rsquo;s cheek paled: for in sooth
he doubted that war was at hand, after all he had heard of the
Dalesmen&rsquo;s dealings with the Dusky Men.&nbsp; And all
battle was loathsome to him, nor for all the gain of his chaffer
had he come into the Dale, had he known that war was looked
for.
But the chiefs of the Dalesmen stirred not, nor changed
countenance; and some of the goodmen who were in the street nigh
the Gate came forth to see what was toward; for they also had
heard the voice of the horn.
Then one of those messengers came up breathless, and stood
before the chiefs, and said:
&lsquo;New tidings, Alderman; here be weaponed strangers come
into the Dale.&rsquo;
The Alderman smiled on him and said: &lsquo;Yea, son, and are
they a great host of men?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said the man, &lsquo;not above a score as I
deem, and there is a woman with them.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Then shall we abide them here,&rsquo; said the
Alderman, &lsquo;and thou mightest have saved thy breath, and
suffered them to bring tidings of themselves; since they may
scarce bring us war.&nbsp; For no man desireth certain and
present death; and that is all that such a band may win at our
hands in battle to-day; and all who  span
class="pagenum">p. 244come in peace are welcome to
us.&nbsp; What like are they to behold?&rsquo;
Said the man: &lsquo;They are tall men gloriously attired, so
that they seem like kinsmen of the Gods; and they bear flowering
boughs in their hands.&rsquo;
The Alderman laughed, and said: &lsquo;If they be Gods they
are welcome indeed; and they shall grow the wiser for their
coming; for they shall learn how guest-fain the Burgdale men may
be.&nbsp; But if, as I deem, they be like unto us, and but the
children of the Gods, then are they as welcome, and it may be
more so, and our greeting to them shall be as their greeting to
us would be.&rsquo;
Even as he spake the horn was winded nearer yet, and more
loudly, and folk came pouring out of the Gate to learn the
tidings.&nbsp; Presently the strangers came from off the Portway
into the space before the Gate; and their leader was a tall and
goodly man of some thirty winters, in glorious array, helm on
head and sword by side, his surcoat green and flowery like the
spring meads.&nbsp; In his right hand he held a branch of the
blossomed black-thorn (for some was yet in blossom), and his left
had hold of the hand of an exceeding fair woman who went beside
him: behind him was a score of weaponed men in goodly attire,
some bearing bows, some long spears, but each bearing a flowering
bough in hand.
The tall man stopped in the midst of the space, and the
Alderman and they with him stirred not; though, as for
Face-of-god, it was to him as if summer had come suddenly into
the midst of winter, and for the very sweetness of delight his
face grew pale.
Then the new-comer drew nigh to the Alderman and said:
&lsquo;Hail to the Gate and the men of the Gate!&nbsp; Hail to
the kindred of the children of the Gods!&rsquo;
But the Alderman stood up and spake: &lsquo;And hail to thee,
tall man!&nbsp; Fair greeting to thee and thy company!&nbsp; Wilt
thou name thyself with thine own name, or shall I call thee
nought save Guest?&nbsp; Welcome art thou, by whatsoever name
thou wilt be called.&nbsp; Here may&rsquo;st thou and thy folk
abide as long as ye will.&rsquo;
p. 245Said
the new-comer: &lsquo;Thanks have thou for thy greeting and for
thy bidding!&nbsp; And that bidding shall we take, whatsoever may
come of it; for we are minded to abide with thee for a
while.&nbsp; But know thou, O Alderman of the Dalesmen, that I am
not sackless toward thee and thine.&nbsp; My name is Folk-might
of the Children of the Wolf, and this woman is the Sun-beam, my
sister, and these behind me are of my kindred, and are well
beloved and trusty.&nbsp; We are no evil men or wrong-doers; yet
have we been driven into sore straits, wherein men must needs at
whiles do deeds that make their friends few and their foes
many.&nbsp; So it may be that I am thy foeman.&nbsp; Yet, if thou
doubtest of me that I shall be a baneful guest, thou shalt have
our weapons of us, and then mayest thou do thy will upon us
without dread; and here first of all is my sword!&rsquo;
Therewith he cast down the flowering branch he was bearing,
and pulled his sword from out his sheath, and took it by the
point, and held out the hilt to Iron-face.
But the Alderman smiled kindly on him and said:
&lsquo;The blade is a good one, and I say it who know the
craft of sword-forging; but I need it not, for thou seest I have
a sword by my side.&nbsp; Keep your weapons, one and all; for ye
have come amongst many and those no weaklings: and if so be that
thy guilt against us is so great that we must needs fall on you,
ye will need all your war-gear.&nbsp; But hereof is no need to
speak till the time of the Folk-mote, which will be holden in
three days&rsquo; wearing; so let us forbear this matter till
then; for I deem we shall have enough to say of other
matters.&nbsp; Now, Folk-might, sit down beside me, and thou
also, Sun-beam, fairest of women.&rsquo;
Therewith he looked into her face and reddened, and said:
&lsquo;Yet belike thou hast a word of greeting for my son,
Face-of-god, unless it be so that ye have not seen him
before?&rsquo;
Then Face-of-god came forward, and took Folk-might by the hand
and kissed him; and he stood before the Sun-beam and took her
hand, and the world waxed a wonder to him as he kissed  a
name="page246">p. 246her cheeks;
and in no wise did she change countenance, save that her eyes
softened, and she gazed at him full kindly from the happiness of
her soul.
Then Face-of-god said: &lsquo;Welcome, Guests, who erewhile
guested me so well: now beginneth the day of your well-doing to
the men of Burgdale; therefore will we do to you as well as we
may.&rsquo;
Then Folk-might and the Sun-beam sat them down with the
chieftains, one on either side of the Alderman, but Face-of-god
passed forth to the others, and greeted them one by one: of them
was Wood-father and his three sons, and Bow-may; and they
rejoiced exceedingly to see him, and Bow-may said:
&lsquo;Now it gladdens my heart to look upon thee alive and
thriving, and to remember that day last winter when I met thee on
the snow, and turned thee back from the perilous path to thy
pleasure, which the Dusky Men were besetting, of whom thou
knewest nought.&nbsp; Yea, it was merry that tide; but this is
better.&nbsp; Nay, friend,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;it availeth
thee nought to strive to look out of the back of thine head: let
it be enough to thee that she is there.&nbsp; Thou art now become
a great chieftain, and she is no less; and this is a meeting of
chieftains, and the folk are looking on and expecting demeanour
of them as of the Gods; and she is not to be dealt with as if she
were the daughter of some little goodman with whom one hath made
tryst in the meadows.&nbsp; There! hearken to me for a while; at
least till I tell thee that thou seemest to me to hold thine head
higher than when last I saw thee; though that is no long time
either.&nbsp; Hast thou been in battle again since that
day?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I have stricken no stroke
since I slew two felons within the same hour that we
parted.&nbsp; And thou, sister, what hast thou done?&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;The grey goose hath been on the wing thrice
since that, bearing on it the bane of evil things.&rsquo;
Then said Wood-wise: &lsquo;Kinswoman, tell him of that
battle, since thou art deft with thy tongue.&rsquo;
p. 247She
said: &lsquo;Weary on battles! it is nought save this: twelve
days agone needs must every fighting-man of the Wolf, carle or of
queen, wend away from Shadowy Vale, while those unmeet for battle
we hid away in the caves at the nether end of the Dale: but
Sun-beam would not endure that night, and fared with us, though
she handled no weapon.&nbsp; All this we had to do because we had
learned that a great company of the Dusky Men were over-nigh to
our Dale, and needs must we fall upon them, lest they should
learn too much, and spread the story.&nbsp; Well, so wise was
Folk-might that we came on them unawares by night and cloud at
the edge of the Pine-wood, and but one of our men was slain, and
of them not one escaped; and when the fight was over we counted
four score and ten of their arm-rings.&rsquo;
He said: &lsquo;Did that or aught else come of our meeting
with them that morning?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;nought came of it: those
we slew were but a straying band.&nbsp; Nay, the four score and
ten slain in the Pine-wood knew not of Shadowy Vale belike, and
had no intent for it: they were but scouring the wood seeking
their warriors that had gone out from Silver-dale and came not
aback.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Thou art wise in war, Bow-may,&rsquo; said Face-of-god,
and he smiled withal.
Bow-may reddened and said: &lsquo;Friend Gold-mane, dost thou
perchance deem that there is aught ill in my warring?&nbsp; And
the Sun-beam, she naysayeth the bearing of weapons; though I deem
that she hath little fear of them when they come her
way.&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;Nay, I deem no ill of it, but much
good.&nbsp; For I suppose that thou hast learned overmuch of the
wont of the Dusky Men, and hast seen their thralls?&rsquo;
She knitted her brows, and all the merriment went out of her
face at that word, and she answered: &lsquo;Yea, thou hast it;
for I have both seen their thralls and been in the Dale of
thralldom; and how then can I do less than I do?&nbsp; But for
thee, I perceive that thou hast been nigh unto our foes and hast
fallen in with p.
248their thralls; and that is well; for whatso tales we
had told thee thereof it is like thou wouldst not have trowed in,
as now thou must do, since thou thyself hast seen these poor
folk.&nbsp; But now I will tell thee, Gold-mane, that my soul is
sick of these comings and goings for the slaughter of a few
wretches; and I long for the Great Day of Battle, when it will be
seen whether we shall live or die; and though I laugh and jest,
yet doth the wearing of the days wear me.&rsquo;
He looked kindly on her and said: &lsquo;I am War-leader of
this Folk, and trust me that the waiting-tide shall not be long;
wherefore now, sister, be merry to-day, for that is but meet and
right; and cast aside thy care, for presently shalt thou behold
many new friends.&nbsp; But now meseemeth overlong have ye been
standing before our Gate, and it is time that ye should see the
inside of our Burg and the inside of our House.&rsquo;
Indeed by this time so many men had come out of the street
that the place before the Gate was all thronged, and from where
he stood Face-of-god could scarce see his father, or Folk-might
and the Sun-beam and the chieftains.
So he took Wood-father by the hand, and close behind him came
Wood-wise and Bow-may, and he cried out for way that he might
speak with the Alderman, and men gave way to them, and he led
those new-comers close up to the gate-seats of the Elders, and as
he clove the press smiling and bright-eyed and happy, all gazed
on him; but the Sun-beam, who was sitting between Iron-face and
the Westland Chapman, and who heretofore had been agaze with eyes
beholding little, past whose ears the words went unheard, and
whose mind wandered into thoughts of things unfashioned yet, when
she beheld him close to her again, then, taken unawares, her eyes
caressed him, and she turned as red as a rose, as she felt all
the sweetness of desire go forth from her to meet him.&nbsp; So
that, he perceiving it, his voice was the clearer and sweeter for
the inward joy he felt, as he said:
&lsquo;Alderman, meseemeth it is now time that we bring our
Guests p.
249into the House of our Fathers; for since they are in
warlike array, and we are no longer living in peace, and I am now
War-leader of the Dale, I deem it but meet that I should have the
guesting of them.&nbsp; Moreover, when we are come into our
House, I will bid thee look into thy treasury, that thou
may&rsquo;st find therein somewhat which it may pleasure us to
give to our Guests.&rsquo;
Said Iron-face: &lsquo;Thou sayest well, son, and since the
day is now worn past noon, and these folk are but just come from
the Waste, therefore such as we have of meat and drink abideth
them.&nbsp; And surely there is within our house a coffer which
belongeth to thee and me; and forsooth I know not why we keep the
treasures hoarded therein, save that it be for this cause: that
if we were to give to our friends that which we ourselves use and
love, which would be of all things pleasant to us, if we gave
them such goods, they would be worn and worsened by our use of
them.&nbsp; For this reason, therefore, do we keep fair things
which we use not, so that we may give them to our friends.
&lsquo;Now, Guests, both of the Waste and the Westland, since
here is no Gate-thing or meeting of the Dale-wardens, and we sit
here but for our pleasure, let us go take our pleasure within
doors for a while, if it seem good to you.&rsquo;
Therewith he arose, and the folk made way for him and his
Guests; and Folk-might went on the right hand of Iron-face, and
beside him went the Chapman, who looked on him with a half-smile,
as though he knew somewhat of him.&nbsp; But on the other side of
Iron-face went the Sun-beam, whose hand he held, and after these
came Face-of-god, leading in the rest of the New-comers, who yet
held the flowery branches in their hands.
Now so much had Face-of-god told the Dalesmen, that they
deemed they all knew these men for their battle-fellows of whom
they had heard tell; and this the more as the men were so goodly
and manly of aspect, especially Folk-might, so that they seemed
as if they were nigh akin to the Gods.&nbsp; As for the Sun-beam,
they knew not how to praise her beauty enough, but they said that
p. 250they had
never known before how fair the Gods might be.&nbsp; So they
raised a great shout of welcome as the men came through the Gate
into the Burg, and all men turned their backs on the booths, so
eager were they to behold closely these new friends.
But as the Guests went from the Gate to the House of the Face,
going very slowly because of the press, there in the front of the
throng stood the Bride with the women of the Runaways, whom she
had caused to be clad very fairly; and she was fain to do them a
pleasure by bringing them to sight of these new-comers, of whom
she had not heard who they were, though she had heard the cry
that strangers were at hand.&nbsp; So there she stood smiling a
little with the pleasure of showing a fair sight to the poor
people, as folk do with children.&nbsp; But when she saw those
twain going on each side of the Alderman she knew them at once;
and when the Sun-beam, who was on his left side, passed so close
to her that she could see the very smoothness and dainty fashion
of her skin, then was she astonied, and the world seemed strange
to her, and till they were gone by, and for a while afterwards,
she knew not where she was nor what she did, though it seemed to
her as if she still saw the face of that fair woman as in a
picture.
But the Sun-beam had noted her at first, even amongst the fair
women of Burgstead, and she so steady and bright beside the
wandering timorous eyes and lowering faces of the thralls.&nbsp;
But suddenly, as eye met eye, she saw her face change; she saw
her cheek whiten, her eyes stare, and her lips quiver, and she
knew at once who it was; for she had not seen her before as
Folk-might had.&nbsp; Then the Sun-beam cast her eyes adown, lest
her compassion might show in her face, and be a fresh grief to
her that had lost the wedding and the love; and so she passed
on.
As for Folk-might, he had seen her at once amongst all that
folk as he came into the street, and in sooth he was looking for
her; and when he saw her face change, as the sight of the
Sun-beam smote upon her heart, his own face burned with shame and
anger, and he looked back at her as he went toward the
House.&nbsp; p.
251But she saw him not, nor noted him; and none deemed it
strange that he looked long on the Bride, the treasure of
Burgstead.&nbsp; But for some while Folk-might was few-spoken and
sharp-spoken amongst the chieftains; for he was slow to master
his longing and his wrath.
So when all the Guests had entered the door of the House of
the Face, the Alderman turned back, and, standing on the
threshold of his House, spake unto the throng:
&lsquo;Men of the Dale, and ye Outlanders who may be here,
know that this is a happy day; for hither have come to us Guests,
men of the kindred of the Gods, and they are even those of whom
Face-of-god my son hath told you.&nbsp; And they are friends of
our friends and foes of our foes.&nbsp; These men are now in my
House, as is but right; but when they come forth I look to you to
cherish them in the best way ye know, and make much of them, as
of those who may help us and who may by us be holpen.&rsquo;
Therewith he went in again and into the Hall, and bade show
the New-comers to the da&iuml;s; and wine of the best, and meat
such as was to hand, was set before them.&nbsp; He bade men also
get ready high feast as great as might be against the evening;
and they did his bidding straightway.
CHAPTER XXXIII.&nbsp; THE ALDERMAN GIVES GIFTS TO THEM OF
SHADOWY VALE.
In the Hall of the Face Folk-might
sat on the da&iuml;s at the right hand of the Alderman, and the
Sun-beam on his left hand.&nbsp; But Iron-face also had beheld
the Bride how her face changed, and he knew the cause, and was
grieved and angry and ashamed thereof: also he bethought him how
this stranger was sitting in the very place where the Bride used
to sit, and of all the love, as of a very daughter, that he had
had for her; howbeit he constrained himself to talk courteously
and kindly both to Folk-might and  span
class="pagenum">p. 252the Sun-beam, as behoved the Chief
of the House and the Alderman of the Dale.&nbsp; Moreover, he was
not a little moved by the goodliness and wisdom of the Sun-beam
and the manliness of Folk-might, who was the most chieftain-like
of men.
But while they sat there Face-of-god went from man to man of
the Guests, and made much of each, but especially of Wood-father
and his sons and Bow-may, and they loved him, and praised him,
and deemed him the best of hall-mates.&nbsp; Nor might the
Sun-beam altogether refrain her from looking lovingly on him, and
it could be seen of her that she deemed he was doing well, and
like a wise leader and chieftain.
So wore away awhile, and men were fulfilled of meat and drink;
so then the Alderman arose and spake, and said:
&lsquo;Is it not so, Guests, that ye would now gladly behold
our market, and the goodly wares which the chapmen have brought
us from the Cities?&rsquo;
Then most men cried out: &lsquo;Yea, yea!&rsquo; and Iron-face
said:
&lsquo;Then shall ye go, nor be holden by me from your
pleasure.&nbsp; And ye kinsmen who are the most guest-fain and
the wisest, go ye with our friends, and make all things easy and
happy for them.&nbsp; But first of all, Guests, I were well
pleased if ye would take some small matters out of our abundance;
for it were well that ye see them ere ye stand before the
chapmen&rsquo;s booths, lest ye chaffer with them for what ye
have already.&rsquo;
They all praised his bounty and thanked him for his goodwill:
so he arose to go to his treasury, and bade certain of his folk
go along with him to bear in the gifts.&nbsp; But ere he had
taken three steps down the hall, Face-of-god prevented him and
said:
&lsquo;Kinsman, if thou hast anywhere a hauberk somewhat
better than folk are wont to bear, such as thine own hand
fashioneth, and a sword of the like stuff, I would have thee give
them, the sword to my brother-in-arms Wood-wise here, and the
war-coat to my sister Bow-may, who shooteth so well in the bow
that none may shoot closer, and very few as close; and her shaft
it was p.
253that delivered me when my skull was amongst the axes of
the Dusky Men: else had I not been here.&rsquo;
Thereat Bow-may reddened and looked down, like a scholar who
hath been over-praised for his learning and diligence; but the
Alderman smiled on her and said:
&lsquo;I thank thee, son, that thou hast let me know what
these our two friends may be fain of: and as for this
damsel-at-arms, it is a little thing that thou askest for her,
and we might have found her something more worthy of her
goodliness; yet forsooth, since we are all bound for the place
where shafts and staves shall be good cheap, a greater treasure
might be of less avail to her.&rsquo;
Thereat men laughed, and the Alderman went down the Hall with
those bearers of gifts, and was away for a space while they drank
and made merry: but presently back they came from the treasury
bearing loads of goodly things which were laid on one of the
endlong boards.&nbsp; Then began the gift-giving: and first he
gave unto Folk-might six golden cups marvellously fashioned, the
work of four generations of wrights in the Dale, and he himself
had wrought the last two thereof.&nbsp; To Sun-beam he gave a
girdle of gold, fashioned with great mastery, whereon were images
of the Gods and the Fathers, and warriors, and beasts of the
field and fowls of the air; and as he girt it about her loins, he
said in a soft voice so that few heard:
&lsquo;Sun-beam, thou fair woman, time has been when thou wert
to us as the edge of the poisonous sword or the midnight torch of
the murderer; but now I know not how it will be, or if the grief
which thou hast given me will ever wear out or not.&nbsp; And now
that I have beheld thee, I have little to do to blame my son; for
indeed when I look on thee I cannot deem that there is any evil
in thee.&nbsp; Yea, however it may be, take thou this gift as the
reward of thine exceeding beauty.&rsquo;
She looked on him with kind eyes, and said meekly:
&lsquo;Indeed, if I have hurt thee unwittingly, I grieve to
have hurt so good a man.&nbsp; Hereafter belike we may talk more
of this, but p.
254now I will but say, that whereas at first I needed but
to win thy son&rsquo;s goodwill, so that our Folk might come to
life and thriving again, now it is come to this, that he holdeth
my heart in his hand and may do what he will with it; therefore I
pray thee withhold not thy love either from him or from
me.&rsquo;
He looked on her wondering, and said: &lsquo;Thou art such an
one as might make the old man young, and the boy grow into
manhood suddenly; and thy voice is as sweet as the voice of the
song-birds singing in the dawn of early summer soundeth to him
who hath been sick unto death, but who hath escaped it and is
mending.&nbsp; And yet I fear thee.&rsquo;
Therewith he kissed her hand and turned unto the others, and
he gave unto Bow-may a hauberk of ring-mail of his own
fashioning, a sure defence and a wonderful work, and the collar
thereof was done with gold and gems.
But he said to her: &lsquo;Fair damsel-at-arms, faithful is
thy face, and the fashion of thee is goodly: now art thou become
one of the best of our friends, and this is little enough to give
thee; yet would we fain ward thy body against the foeman; so
grieve us not by gainsaying us.&rsquo;
And Bow-may was exceeding glad, and scarce knew how to cease
handling that marvel of ring-mail.
Then to Wood-wise Iron-face gave a most goodly sword, the
blade all marked with dark lines like the stream of an eddying
river, the hilts of steel and gold marvellously wrought; and all
the work of a smith who had dwelt in the house of his
father&rsquo;s father, and was a great warrior.
Unto Wood-father he gave a very goodly helm parcel-gilded; and
to his sons and the other folk fair gifts of weapons and jewels
and girdles and cups and other good things; so that their hearts
were full of joy, and they all praised his open hand.
Then some of the best and merriest of the kinsmen of the Face,
and Face-of-god with them, brought the Guests out into the street
and among the booths.&nbsp; There Face-of-god beheld  a
name="page255">p. 255the Bride
again; and she was standing by the booth of a chapman and dealing
with him for a piece of goodly silken cloth to be a gown for one
of her guests, and she was talking and smiling as she chaffered
with him, as her wont was; for she was ever very friendly of
demeanour with all men.&nbsp; But he noted that she was yet
exceeding pale, and he was right sorry thereof, for he loved her
friendly; yet now had he no shame for all that had befallen, when
he bethought him of the Sun-beam and the love she had for
him.&nbsp; And also he had a deeming that the Bride would better
of her grief.
CHAPTER XXXIV.&nbsp; THE CHIEFTAINS TAKE COUNSEL IN THE HALL
OF THE FACE.
Then turned Face-of-god back into
the Hall, and saw where Iron-face sat at the da&iuml;s, and with
him Folk-might and Stone-face and the Elder of the Dale-wardens,
and Sun-beam withal; so he went soberly up to the board, and sat
himself down thereat beside Stone-face, over against Folk-might
and his father, beside whom sat the Sun-beam; and Folk-might
looked on him gravely, as a man powerful and trustworthy, yet was
his look somewhat sour.
Then the Alderman said: &lsquo;My son, I said not to thee come
back presently, because I wotted that thou wouldst surely do so,
knowing that we have much to speak of.&nbsp; For, whatever these
thy friends may have done, or whatsoever thou hast done with them
to grieve us, all that must be set aside at this present time,
since the matter in hand is to save the Dale and its folk.&nbsp;
What sayest thou hereon?&nbsp; Since, young as thou mayst be,
thou art our War-leader, and doubtless shalt so be after the
Folk-mote hath been holden.&rsquo;
Face-of-god answered not hastily: indeed, as he sat thinking
for a minute or two, the fair spring day seemed to darken about
p. 256them or
to glare into the light of flames amidst the night-tide; and the
joyous clamour without doors seemed to grow hoarse and fearful as
the sound of wailing and shrieking.&nbsp; But he spake firmly and
simply in a clear voice, and said:
&lsquo;There can be no two words concerning what we have to
aim at; these Dusky Men we must slay everyone, though we be fewer
than they be.&rsquo;
Folk-might smiled and nodded his head; but the others sat
staring down the hall or into the hangings.
Then spake Folk-might: &lsquo;Thou wert a boy methought when I
cast my spear at thee last autumn, Face-of-god, but now hast thou
grown into a man.&nbsp; Now tell me, what deemest thou we must do
to slay them all?&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;Once again it is clear that we must
fall upon them at home in Rose-dale and Silver-dale.&rsquo;
Again Folk-might nodded: but Iron-face said:
&lsquo;Needeth this?&nbsp; May we not ward the Dale and send
many bands into the wood to fall upon them when we meet
them?&nbsp; Yea, and so doing these our guests have already slain
many, as this valiant man hath told me e&rsquo;en now.&nbsp; Will
ye not slay so many at last, that they shall learn to fear us,
and abide at home and leave us at peace?&rsquo;
But Face-of-god said: &lsquo;Meseemeth, father, that this is
not thy rede, and that thou sayest this but to try me: and
perchance ye have been talking about me when I was without in the
street e&rsquo;en now.&nbsp; Even if it might be that we should
thus cow these felons into abiding at home and tormenting their
own thralls at their ease, yet how then are our friends of the
Wolf holpen to their own again?&nbsp; And I shall tell thee that
I have promised to this man and this woman that I will give them
no less than a man&rsquo;s help in this matter.&nbsp; Moreover, I
have spoken in every house of the Dale, and to the Shepherds and
the Woodlanders, and there is no man amongst them but will follow
me in the quarrel.&nbsp; Furthermore, they have heard of the
thralldom that is p.
257done on men no great way from their own houses; yea,
they have seen it; and they remember the old saw, &ldquo;Grief in
thy neighbour&rsquo;s hall is grief in thy garth,&rdquo; and sure
it is, father, that whether thou or I gainsay them, go they will
to deliver the thralls of the Dusky Men, and will leave us alone
in the Dale.&rsquo;
&lsquo;This is no less than sooth,&rsquo; said the
Dale-warden, &lsquo;never have men gone forth more joyously to a
merry-making than all men of us shall wend to this
war.&rsquo;
&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;of one thing ye
may be sure, that these men will not abide our pleasure till we
cut them all off in scattered bands, nor will they sit deedless
at home.&nbsp; Nor indeed may they; for we have heard from their
thralls that they look to have fresh tribes of them come to hand
to eat their meat and waste their servants, and these and they
must find new abodes and new thralls; and they are now warned by
the overthrows and slayings that they have had at our hands that
we are astir, and they will not delay long, but will fall upon us
with all their host; it might even be to-day or
to-morrow.&rsquo;
Said Folk-might: &lsquo;In all this thou sayest sooth, brother
of the Dale; and to cut this matter short, I will tell you all,
that yesterday we had with us a runaway from Silver-dale (it is
overlong to tell how we fell in with her; for it was a
woman).&nbsp; But she told us that this very moon is a new tribe
come into the Dale, six long hundreds in number, and twice as
many more are looked for in two eights of days, and that ere this
moon hath waned, that is, in twenty-four days, they will wend
their ways straight for Burgdale, for they know the ways
thereto.&nbsp; So I say that Face-of-god is right in all
wise.&nbsp; But tell me, brother, hast thou thought of how we
shall come upon these men?&rsquo;
&lsquo;How many men wilt thou lead into battle?&rsquo; said
Face-of-god.
Folk-might reddened, and said: &lsquo;A few, a few; maybe
two-hundreds all told.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;but some special
gain wilt thou be to us.&rsquo;
p.
258&lsquo;So I deem at least,&rsquo; said Folk-might.
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;Good is that.&nbsp; Now have we held
our Weapon-show in the Dale, and we find that we together with
you be sixteen long hundreds of men; and the tale of the foemen
that be now in Silver-dale, new-comers and all, shall be three
thousands or thereabout, and in Rose-dale hard on a
thousand.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Scarce so many,&rsquo; said Folk-might; &lsquo;some of
the felons have died; we told over our silver arm-rings
yesterday, and the tale was three hundred and eighty and
six.&nbsp; Besides, they were never so many as thou
deemest.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;yet at least they
shall outnumber us sorely.&nbsp; We may scarce leave the Dale
unguarded when our host is gone; therefore I deem that we shall
have but one thousand of men for our onslaught on
Silver-dale.&rsquo;
&lsquo;How come ye to that?&rsquo; said Stone-face.
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;Abide a while, fosterer!&nbsp; Though
the odds between us be great, it is not to be hidden that I wot
how ye of the Wolf know of privy passes into Silver-dale; yea,
into the heart thereof; and this is the special gain ye have to
give us.&nbsp; Therefore we, the thousand men, falling on the foe
unawares, shall make a great slaughter of them; and if the murder
be but grim enough, those thralls of theirs shall fear us and not
them, as already they hate them and not us, so that we may look
to them for rooting out these sorry weeds after the
overthrow.&nbsp; And what with one thing, what with another, we
may cherish a good hope of clearing Silver-dale at one stroke
with the said thousand men.
&lsquo;There remaineth Rose-dale, which will be easier to deal
with, because the Dusky Men therein are fewer and the thralls as
many: that also would I fall on at the same time as we fall on
Silver-dale with the men that are left over from the Silver-dale
onslaught.&nbsp; Wherefore my rede is, that we gather all those
unmeet for battle in the field into this Burg, with ten tens of
men to strengthen them; which shall be enough for them, along
with the old men, and lads, and sturdy women, to defend
themselves till help comes, if aught  span
class="pagenum">p. 259of evil befall, or to flee into the
mountains, or at the worst to die valiantly.&nbsp; Then let the
other five hundreds fare up to Rose-dale, and fall on the Dusky
Men therein about the same time, but not before our onslaught on
Silver-dale: thus shall hand help foot, so that stumbling be not
falling; and we may well hope that our rede shall
thrive.&rsquo;
Then was he silent, and the Sun-beam looked upon him with
gleaming eyes and parted lips, waiting eagerly to hear what
Folk-might would say.&nbsp; He held his peace a while, drumming
on the board with his fingers, and none else spake a word.&nbsp;
At last he said:
&lsquo;War-leader of Burgdale, all that thou hast spoken likes
me well, and even so must it be done, saving that parting of our
host and sending one part to fall upon Rose-dale.&nbsp; I say,
nay; let us put all our might into that one stroke on
Silver-dale, and then we are undone indeed if we fail; but so
shall we be if we fail anywise; but if we win Silver-dale, then
shall Rose-dale lie open before us.&rsquo;
&lsquo;My brother,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;thou art a
tried warrior, and I but a lad: but dost thou not see this, that
whatever we do, we shall not at one onslaught slay all the Dusky
Men of Silver-dale, and those that flee before us shall betake
them to Rose-dale, and tell all the tale, and what shall hinder
them then from falling on Burgdale (since they are no great way
from it) after they have murdered what they will of the unhappy
people under their hands?&rsquo;
Said Folk-might: &lsquo;I say not but that there is a risk
thereof, but in war we must needs run such risks, and all should
be risked rather than that our blow on Silver-dale be
light.&nbsp; For we be the fewer; and if the foemen have time to
call that to mind, then are we all lost.&rsquo;
Said Stone-face: &lsquo;Meseemeth, War-leader, that there is
nought much to dread in leaving Rose-dale to itself for a while;
for not only may we follow hard on the fleers if they flee to
Rose-dale, and be there no long time after them, before they have
time to stir p.
260their host; but also after the overthrow we shall be
free to send men back to Burgdale by way of Shadowy Vale.&nbsp; I
deem that herein Folk-might hath the right of it.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Even so say I,&rsquo; said the Alderman;
&lsquo;besides, we might theft leave more folk behind us for the
warding of the Dale.&nbsp; So, son, the risk whereof thou
speakest groweth the lesser the longer it is looked
on.&rsquo;
Then spake the Dale-warden: &lsquo;Yet saving your wisdom,
Alderman, the risk is there yet.&nbsp; For if these felons come
into the Dale at all, even if the folk left behind hold the Burg
and keep themselves unmurdered, yet may they not hinder the foe
from spoiling our homesteads; so that our folk coming back in
triumph shall find ruin at home, and spend weary days in hunting
their foemen, who shall, many of them, escape into the
Wild-wood.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said the Sun-beam, &lsquo;sooth is that;
and Face-of-god is wise to think of it and of other
matters.&nbsp; Yet one thing we must bear in mind, that all may
not go smoothly in our day&rsquo;s work in Silver-dale; so we
must have force there to fall back on, in case we miss our stroke
at first.&nbsp; Therefore, I say, send we no man to Rose-dale,
and leave we no able man-at-arms behind in the Burg, so that we
have with us every blade that may be gathered.&rsquo;
Iron-face smiled and said: &lsquo;Thou art wise, damsel; and I
marvel that so fair-fashioned a thing as thou can think so hardly
of the meeting of the fallow blades.&nbsp; But hearken! will not
the Dusky Men hear that we have stripped the Dale of
fighting-men, and may they not then give our host the go-by and
send folk to ruin us?&rsquo;
There was silence while Face-of-god looked down on the board;
but presently he lifted up his face and said:
&lsquo;Folk-might was right when he said that all must be
risked.&nbsp; Let us leave Rose-dale till we have overcome them
of Silver-dale.&nbsp; Moreover, my father, thou must not deem of
these felons as if they were of like wits to us, to forecast the
deeds to come, and weigh the chances nicely, and unravel tangled
clews.&nbsp; Rather they move  span
class="pagenum">p. 261like to the stares in autumn, or the
winter wild-geese, and will all be thrust forward by some sting
that entereth into their imaginations.&nbsp; Therefore, if they
have appointed one moon to wear before they fall upon us, they
will not stir till then, and we have time enough to do what must
be done.&nbsp; Wherefore am I now of one mind with the rest of
you.&nbsp; Now meseemeth it were well that these things which we
have spoken here, and shall speak, should not be noised abroad
openly; nay, at the Folk-mote it would be well that nought be
said about the day or the way of our onslaught on Silver-dale,
lest the foe take warning and be on their guard.&nbsp; Though,
sooth to say, did I deem that if they had word of our intent they
of Rose-dale would join themselves to them of Silver-dale, and
that we should thus have all our foes in one net, then were I
fain if the word would reach them.&nbsp; For my soul loathes the
hunting that shall befall up and down the wood for the slaying of
a man here, and two or three there, and the wearing of the days
in wandering up and down with weapons in the hand, and the
spinning out of hatred and delaying of peace.&rsquo;
Then Iron-face reached his hand across the board and took his
son&rsquo;s hand, and said:
&lsquo;Hail to thee, son, for thy word!&nbsp; Herein thou
speakest as if from my very soul, and fain am I of such a
War-leader.&rsquo;
And desire drew the eyes of the Sun-beam to Face-of-god, and
she beheld him proudly.&nbsp; But he said:
&lsquo;All hath been spoken that the others of us may speak;
and now it falleth to the part of Folk-might to order our goings
for the tryst for the onslaught, and the trysting-place shall be
in Shadowy Vale.&nbsp; How sayest thou, Chief of the
Wolf?&rsquo;
Said Folk-might: &lsquo;I have little to say; and it is for
the War-leader to see to this closely and piecemeal.&nbsp; I
deem, as we all deem, that there should be no delay; yet were it
best to wend not all together to Shadowy Vale, but in divers
bands, as soon as ye may after the Folk-mote, by the sure and
nigh ways that we shall show you.&nbsp; And when we are gathered
there, short is the rede, for all  span
class="pagenum">p. 262is ready there to wend by the passes
which we know throughly, and whereby it is but two days&rsquo;
journey to the head of Silver-dale, nigh to the caves of the
silver, where the felons dwell the thickest.&rsquo;
He set his teeth, and his colour came and went: for as
constantly as the onslaught had been in his mind, yet whenever he
spake of the great day of battle, hope and joy and anger wrought
a tumult in his soul; and now that it was so nigh withal, he
could not refrain his joy.
But he spake again: &lsquo;Now therefore, War-leader, it is
for thee to order the goings of thy folk.&nbsp; But I will tell
thee that they shall not need to take aught with them save their
weapons and victual for the way, that is, for thirty hours;
because all is ready for them in Shadowy Vale, though it be but a
poor place as to victual.&nbsp; Canst thou tell us, therefore,
what thou wilt do?&rsquo;
Face-of-god had knit his brows and become gloomy of
countenance; but now his face cleared, and he set his hand to his
pouch, and drew forth a written parchment, and said:
&lsquo;This is the order whereof I have bethought me.&nbsp;
Before the Folk-mote I and the Wardens shall speak to the leaders
of hundreds, who be mostly here at the Fair, and give them the
day and the hour whereon they shall, each hundred, take their
weapons and wend to Shadowy Vale, and also the place where they
shall meet the men of yours who shall lead them across the
Waste.&nbsp; These hundred-leaders shall then go straightway and
give the word to the captains of scores, and the captains of
scores to the captains of tens; and if, as is scarce doubtful,
the Folk-mote yea-says the onslaught and the fellowship with you
of the Wolf, then shall those leaders of tens bring their men to
the trysting-place, and so go their ways to Shadowy Vale.&nbsp;
Now here I have the roll of our Weapon-show, and I will look to
it that none shall be passed over; and if ye ask me in what order
they had best get on the way, my rede is that a two hundred
should depart on the very evening of the day of the Folk-mote,
and these to be of our  span
class="pagenum">p. 263folk of the Upper Dale; and on the
morning of the morrow of the Folk-mote another two hundreds from
the Dale; and in the evening of the same day the folk of the
Shepherds, three hundreds or more, and that will be easy to them;
again on the next day two more bands of the Lower Dale, one in
the morning, one in the evening.&nbsp; Lastly, in the earliest
dawn of the third day from the Folk-mote shall the Woodlanders
wend their ways.&nbsp; But one hundred of men let us leave behind
for the warding of the Burg, even as we agreed before.&nbsp; As
for the place of tryst for the faring over the Waste, let it be
the end of the knolls just by the jaws of the pass yonder, where
the Weltering Water comes into the Dale from the East.&nbsp; How
say ye?&rsquo;
They all said, and Folk-might especially, that it was right
well devised, and that thus it should be done.
Then turned Face-of-god to the Dale-warden, and said:
&lsquo;It were good, brother, that we saw the other wardens as
soon as may be, to do them to wit of this order, and what they
have to do.&rsquo;
Therewith he arose and took the Elder of the Dale-wardens away
with him, and the twain set about their business
straight-way.&nbsp; Neither did the others abide long in the
Hall, but went out into the Burg to see the chapmen and their
wares.&nbsp; There the Alderman bought what he needed of iron and
steel and other matters; and Folk-might cheapened him a dagger
curiously wrought, and a web of gold and silk for the Sun-beam,
for which wares he paid in silver arm-rings, new-wrought and of
strange fashion.
But amidst of the chaffer was now a great ring of men; and in
the midst of the ring stood Redesman, fiddle and bow in hand, and
with him were four damsels wondrously arrayed; for the first was
clad in a smock so craftily wrought with threads of green and
many colours, that it seemed like a piece of the green field
beset with primroses and cowslips and harebells and windflowers,
rather than a garment woven and sewn; and in her hand she bore a
p. 264naked
sword, with golden hilts and gleaming blade.&nbsp; But the second
bore on her roses done in like manner, both blossoms and green
leaves, wherewith her body was covered decently, which else had
been naked.&nbsp; The third was clad as though she were wading
the wheat-field to the waist, and above was wrapped in the leaves
and bunches of the wine-tree.&nbsp; And the fourth was clad in a
scarlet gown flecked with white wool to set forth the
winter&rsquo;s snow, and broidered over with the burning brands
of the Holy Hearth; and she bore on her head a garland of
mistletoe.&nbsp; And these four damsels were clearly seen to
image the four seasons of the year&mdash;Spring, Summer, Autumn,
and Winter.&nbsp; But amidst them stood a fountain or conduit of
gilded work cunningly wrought, and full of the best wine of the
Dale, and gilded cups and beakers hung about it.
So now Redesman fell to caressing his fiddle with the bow till
it began to make sweet music, and therewith the hearts of all
danced with it; and presently words come into his mouth, and he
fell to singing; and the damsels answered him:
Earth-wielders, that fashion the
Dale-dwellers&rsquo; treasure,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Soft are ye by seeming, yet hardy of heart!
No warrior amongst us withstandeth your pleasure;
&nbsp;&nbsp; No man from his meadow may thrust you apart.
Fresh and fair are your bodies, but far beyond
telling
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the years of your lives, and the craft ye have
stored.
Come give us a word, then, concerning our dwelling,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the days to befall us, the fruit of the
sword.
Winter saith:
When last in the feast-hall the Yule-fire
flickered,
&nbsp;&nbsp; The foot of no foeman fared over the snow,
And nought but the wind with the ash-branches bickered:
&nbsp;&nbsp; Next Yule ye may deem it a long time ago.

class="pagenum">p. 265Autumn saith:
Loud laughed ye last year in the wheat-field
a-smiting;
&nbsp;&nbsp; And ye laughed as your backs drave the beam of the
press.
When the edge of the war-sword the acres are lighting
&nbsp;&nbsp; Look up to the Banner and laugh ye no less.
Summer saith:
Ye called and I came, and how good was the
greeting,
&nbsp;&nbsp; When ye wrapped me in roses both bosom and side! br
/>
Here yet shall I long, and be fain of our meeting,
&nbsp;&nbsp; As hidden from battle your coming I bide.
Spring saith:
I am here for your comfort, and lo! what I
carry;
&nbsp;&nbsp; The blade with the bright edges bared to the sun. br
/>
To the field, to the work then, that e&rsquo;en I may tarry
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the end of the tale in my first days begun!
Therewith the throng opened, and a young man stepped lightly
into the ring, clad in very fair armour, with a gilded helm on
his head; and he took the sword from the hand of the Maiden of
Spring, and waved it in the air till the westering sun flashed
back from it.&nbsp; Then each of the four damsels went up to the
swain and kissed his mouth; and Redesman drew the bow across the
strings, and the four damsels sang together, standing round about
the young warrior:
It was but a while since for earth&rsquo;s sake
we trembled,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lest the increase our life-days had won for the
Dale,
All the wealth that the moons and the years had assembled,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Should be but a mock for the days of your bale.
But now we behold the sun smite on the token br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the hand of the Champion, the heart of a man; br
/>
p. 266We look
down the long years and see them unbroken;
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forth fareth the Folk by the ways it began.
So bid ye these chapmen in autumn returning, br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To bring iron for ploughshares and steel for the
scythe,
And the over-sea oil that hath felt the sun&rsquo;s burning, br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fair webs for your women soft-spoken and
blithe;
And pledge ye your word in the market to meet
them,
&nbsp;&nbsp; As many a man and as many a maid,
As eager as ever, as guest-fain to greet them,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bide till the booth from the waggon is made.
Come, guests of our lovers! for we, the
year-wielders,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bid each man and all to come hither and take
A cup from our hands midst the peace of our shielders,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And drink to the days of the Dale that we make.
Then went the damsels to that wine-fountain, and drew thence
cups of the best and brightest wine of the Dale, and went round
about the ring, and gave drink to whomsoever would, both of the
chapmen and the others; while the weaponed youth stood in the
midst bearing aloft his sword and shield like an image in a holy
place, and Redesman&rsquo;s bow still went up and down the
strings, and drew forth a sweet and merry tune.
Great game it was now to see the stark Burgdale carles
dragging the Men of the Plain, little loth, up to the front of
the ring, that they might stretch out their hands for a cup, and
how many a one, as he took it, took as much as he might of the
damsel&rsquo;s hand withal.&nbsp; As for the damsels, they played
the Holy Play very daintily, neither reddening nor laughing, but
faring so solemnly, and withal so sweetly and bright-faced, that
it might well have been deemed that they were in very sooth
Maidens of the God of Earth sent from the ever-enduring Hall to
cheer the hearts of men.
So simply and blithely did the Men of Burgdale disport them  a
name="page267">p. 267after the
manner of their fathers, trusting in their valour and beholding
the good days to be.
So wore the evening, and when night was come, men feasted
throughout the Burg from house to house, and every hall was
full.&nbsp; But the Guests from Shadowy Vale feasted in the Hall
of the Face in all glee and goodwill; and with them were the
chief of the chapmen and two others; but the rest of them had
been laid hold of by goodmen of the Burg, and dragged into their
feast-halls, for they were fain of those guests and their
tales.&nbsp; One of the chapmen in the House of the Face knew
Folk-might, and hailed him by the name he had borne in the
Cities, Regulus to wit; indeed, the chief chapman knew him, and
even somewhat over-well, for he had been held to ransom by
Folk-might in those past days, and even yet feared him, because
he, the chapman, had played somewhat of a dastard&rsquo;s part to
him.&nbsp; But the other was an open-hearted and merry fellow,
and no weakling; and Folk-might was fain of his talk concerning
times bygone, and the fields they had foughten in, and other
adventures that had befallen them, both good and evil.
As for Face-of-god, he went about the Hall soberly, and spake
no more than behoved him, so as not to seem a mar-feast; for the
image of the slaughter to be yet abode with him, and his heart
foreboded the after-grief of the battle.&nbsp; He had no speech
with the Sun-beam till men were sundering after the feast, and
then he came close to her amidst of the turmoil, and said:
&lsquo;Time presses on me these days; but if thou wouldest
speak with me to-morrow as I would with thee, then mightest thou
go on the Bridge of the Burg about sunrise, and I will be there,
and we two only.&rsquo;
Her face, which had been somewhat sad that evening (for she
had been watching his), brightened at that word, and she took his
hand as folk came thronging round about them, and said:
&lsquo;Yea, friend, I shall be there, and fain of
thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; And therewithal they sundered for that
night.
p. 268And
all men went to sleep throughout the Burg: howbeit they set a
watch at the Burg-Gate; and Hall-face, when he was coming back
from the woodland ward about sunset, fell in with Redcoat of
Waterless and four score men on the Portway coming to meet him
and take his place.&nbsp; All which was clean contrary to the
wont of the Burgdalers, who at most whiles held no watch and
ward, not even in Fair-time.
CHAPTER XXXV.&nbsp; FACE-OF-GOD TALKETH WITH THE
SUN-BEAM.
Face-of-God was at the Bridge on
the morrow before sun-rising, and as he turned about at the
Bridge-foot he saw the Sun-beam coming down the street; and his
heart rose to his mouth at the sight of her, and he went to meet
her and took her by the hand; and there were no words between
them till they had kissed and caressed each other, for there was
no one stirring about them.&nbsp; So they went over the Bridge
into the meadows, and eastward of the beaten path thereover.
The grass was growing thick and strong, and it was full of
flowers, as the cowslip and the oxlip, and the chequered
daffodil, and the wild tulip: the black-thorn was well-nigh done
blooming, but the hawthorn was in bud, and in some places growing
white.&nbsp; It was a fair morning, warm and cloudless, but the
night had been misty, and the haze still hung about the meadows
of the Dale where they were wettest, and the grass and its
flowers were heavy with dew, so that the Sun-beam went barefoot
in the meadow.&nbsp; She had a dark cloak cast over her kirtle,
and had left her glittering gown behind her in the House.
They went along hand in hand exceeding fain of each other, and
the sun rose as they went, and the long beams of gold shone
through the tops of the tall trees across the grass they trod,
and a light wind rose up in the north, as Face-of-god stayed a
moment p.
269and turned toward the Face of the Sun and prayed to
Him, while the Sun-beam&rsquo;s hand left the War-leader&rsquo;s
hand and stole up to his golden locks and lay amongst them.
Presently they went on, and the feet of Face-of-god led him
unwitting toward the chestnut grove by the old dyke where he had
met the Bride such a little while ago, till he bethought whither
he was going and stopped short and reddened; and the Sun-beam
noted it, but spake not; but he said: &lsquo;Hereby is a fair
place for us to sit and talk till the day&rsquo;s work
beginneth.&rsquo;
So then he turned aside, and soon they came to a hawthorn
brake out of which arose a great tall-stemmed oak, showing no
green as yet save a little on its lower twigs; and anigh it, yet
with room for its boughs to grow freely, was a great bird-cherry
tree, all covered now with sweet-smelling white blossoms.&nbsp;
There they sat down on the trunk of a tree felled last year, and
she cast off her cloak, and took his face between her two hands
and kissed him long and fondly, and for a while their joy had no
word.&nbsp; But when speech came to them, it was she that spake
first and said:
&lsquo;Gold-mane, my dear, sorely I wonder at thee and at me,
how we are changed since that day last autumn when I first saw
thee.&nbsp; Whiles I think, didst thou not laugh when thou wert
by thyself that day, and mock at me privily, that I must needs
take such wisdom on myself, and lesson thee standing like a
stripling before me.&nbsp; Dost thou not call it all to mind and
make merry over it, now that thou art become a great chieftain
and a wise warrior, and I am yet what I always was, a young
maiden of the kindred; save that now I abide no longer for my
love?&rsquo;
Her face was exceeding bright and rippled with joyous smiles,
and he looked at her and deemed that her heart was overflowing
with happiness, and he wondered at her indeed that she was so
glad of him, and he said:
&lsquo;Yea, indeed, oft do I see that morning in the woodland
hall and thee and me therein, as one looketh on a picture; yea
verily, p.
270and I laugh, yet is it for very bliss; neither do I
mock at all.&nbsp; Did I not deem thee a God then? and am I not
most happy now when I can call it thus to mind?&nbsp; And as to
thee, thou wert wise then, and yet art thou wise now.&nbsp; Yea,
I thought thee a God; and if we are changed, is it not rather
that thou hast lifted me up to thee, and not come down to
me?&rsquo;
Yet therewithal he knit his brows somewhat and said:
&lsquo;Yet thou hast not to tell me that all thy love for thy
Folk, and thy yearning hope for its recoverance, was but a
painted show.&nbsp; Else why shouldst thou love me the better now
that I am become a chieftain, and therefore am more meet to
understand thy hope and thy sorrow?&nbsp; Did I not behold thee
as we stood before the Wolf of the Hall of Shadowy Vale, how the
tears stood in thine eyes as thou beheldest him, and thine hand
in mine quivered and clung to me, and thou wert all changed in a
moment of time?&nbsp; Was all this then but a seeming and a
beguilement?&rsquo;
&lsquo;O young man,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;hast thou not said
it, that we stood there close together, and my hand in thine and
desire growing up in me?&nbsp; Dost thou not know how this also
quickeneth the story of our Folk, and our goodwill towards the
living, and remembrance of the dead?&nbsp; Shall they have lived
and desired, and we deny desire and life?&nbsp; Or tell me: what
was it made thee so chieftain-like in the Hall yesterday, so that
thou wert the master of all our wills, for as self-willed as some
of us were?&nbsp; Was it not that I, whom thou deemest lovely,
was thereby watching thee and rejoicing in thee?&nbsp; Did not
the sweetness of thy love quicken thee?&nbsp; Yet because of that
was thy warrior&rsquo;s wisdom and thy foresight an empty
show?&nbsp; Heedest thou nought the Folk of the Dale?&nbsp;
Wouldest thou sunder from the children of the Fathers, and dwell
amongst strangers?&rsquo;
He kissed her and smiled on her and said: &lsquo;Did I not say
of thee that thou wert wiser than the daughters of men?&nbsp; See
how wise thou hast made me!&rsquo;
p. 271She
spake again: &lsquo;Nay, nay, there was no feigning in my love
for my people.&nbsp; How couldest thou think it, when the Fathers
and the kindred have made this body that thou lovest, and the
voice of their songs is in the speech thou deemest
sweet?&rsquo;
He said: &lsquo;Sweet friend, I deemed not that there was
feigning in thee: I was but wondering what I am and how I was
fashioned, that I should make thee so glad that thou couldst for
a while forget thy hope of the days before we met.&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;O how glad, how glad!&nbsp; Yet was I nought
hapless.&nbsp; In despite of all trouble I had no down-weighing
grief, and I had the hope of my people before me.&nbsp; Good were
my days; but I knew not till now how glad a child of man may
be.&rsquo;
Their words were hushed for a while amidst their
caresses.&nbsp; Then she said:
&lsquo;Gold-mane, my friend, I mocked not my past self because
I deem that I was a fool then, but because I see now that all
that my wisdom could do, would have come about without my wisdom;
and that thou, deeming thyself something less than wise, didst
accomplish the thing I craved, and that which thou didst crave
also; and withal wisdom embraced thee, along with
love.&rsquo;
Therewith she cast her arms about him and said:
&lsquo;O friend, I mock myself of this: that erst thou
deemedst me a God and fearedst me, but now thou seemest to me to
be a God, and I fear thee.&nbsp; Yea, though I have longed so
sore to be with thee since the day of Shadowy Vale, and though I
have wearied of the slow wearing of the days, and it hath
tormented me; yet now that I am with thee, I bless the torment of
my longing; for it is but my longing that compelleth me to cast
away my fear of thee and caress thee, because I have learned how
sweet it is to love thee thus.&rsquo;
He wound his arms about her, and sweeter was their longing
than mere joy; and though their love was beyond measure, yet was
therein no shame to aught, not even to the lovely Dale and that
fair season of spring, so goodly they were among the children of
men.
p. 272In a
while they arose and turned homeward, and went over the open
meadow, and it was yet early, and the dew was as heavy on the
grass as before, though the wide sunlight was now upon it,
glittering on the wet blades, and shining through the bells of
the chequered daffodils till they looked like gouts of blood.
&lsquo;Look,&rsquo; said Sun-beam, as they went along by the
same way whereas they came, &lsquo;deemest thou not that other
speech-friends besides us have been abroad to talk together apart
on this morning of the eve of battle.&nbsp; It is nought
unwonted, that we do, even though we forget the trouble of the
people to think of our own joy for a while.&rsquo;
The smile died out of her face as she spoke, and she said:
&lsquo;O friend, this much may I say for myself in all sooth,
that indeed I would die for the kindred and its good days, nor
falter therein; but if I am to die, might I but die in thine
arms!&rsquo;
He looked very lovingly on her, and put his arm about her and
kissed her and said: &lsquo;What ails us to stand in the
doom-ring and bear witness against ourselves before the
kindred?&nbsp; Now I will say, that whatsoever the kindred may or
can call upon me to do, that will I do, nor grudge the deed: I am
sackless before them.&nbsp; But that is true which I spake to
thee when we came together up out of Shadowy Vale, to wit, that I
am no strifeful man, but a peaceful; and I look to it to win
through this war, and find on the other side either death, or
life amongst a happy folk; and I deem that this is mostly the
mind of our people.&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;Thou shalt not die, thou shalt not
die!&rsquo;
&lsquo;Mayhappen not,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;yet yesterday I
could not but look into the slaughter to come, and it seemed to
me a grim thing, and darkened the day for me; and I grew acold as
a man walking with the dead.&nbsp; But tell me: thou sayest I
shall not die; dost thou say this only because I am become dear
to thee, or dost thou speak it out of thy foresight of things to
come?&rsquo;
She stopped and looked silently a while over the meadows
towards the houses of the Thorp: they were standing now on  a
name="page273">p. 273the border
of a shallow brook that ran down toward the Weltering Water; it
had a little strand of fine sand like the sea-shore, driven close
together, and all moist, because that brook was used to flood the
meadow for the feeding of the grass; and the last evening the
hatches which held up the water had been drawn, so that much had
ebbed away and left the strand aforesaid.
After a while the Sun-beam turned to Face-of-god, and she was
become somewhat pale; she said:
&lsquo;Nay, I have striven to see, and can see nought save the
picture of hope and fear that I make for myself.&nbsp; So it oft
befalleth foreseeing women, that the love of a man cloudeth their
vision.&nbsp; Be content, dear friend; it is for life or death;
but whichso it be, the same for me and thee together?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and well content I am; so
now let each of us trust in the other to be both good and dear,
even as I trusted in thee the first hour that I looked on
thee.&rsquo;
&lsquo;It is well,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;it is well.&nbsp;
How fair thou art; and how fair is the morn, and this our Dale in
the goodly season; and all this abideth us when the battle is
over.&rsquo;
Once more her voice became sweet and wheedling, and the smile
lit up her face again, and she pointed down to the sand with her
finger, and said:
&lsquo;See thou!&nbsp; Here indeed have other lovers passed by
across the brook.&nbsp; Shall we wish them good luck?&rsquo;
He laughed and looked down on the sand, and said:
&lsquo;Thou art in haste to make a story up.&nbsp; Indeed I
see that these first footprints are of a woman, for no carle of
the Dale has a foot as small; for we be tall fellows; and these
others withal are a man&rsquo;s footprints; and if they showed
that they had been walking side by side, simple had been thy
tale; but so it is not.&nbsp; I cannot say that these two pairs
of feet went over the brook within five minutes of each other;
but sure it is that they could not have been faring side by
side.&nbsp; Well, belike they were lovers bickering, and we may
wish them luck out of that.&nbsp; Truly  a
name="page274">p. 274it is well
seen that Bow-may hath done thine hunting for thee, dear friend;
or else wouldest thou have lacked venison; for thou hast no
hunter&rsquo;s eye.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but wish them luck, and
give me thine hand upon it.&rsquo;
He took her hand, and fondled it, and said: &lsquo;By this
hand of my speech-friend, I wish these twain all luck, in love
and in leisure, in faring and fighting, in sowing and samming, in
getting and giving.&nbsp; Is it well enough wished?&nbsp; If so
it be, then come thy ways, dear friend; for the day&rsquo;s work
is at hand.&rsquo;
&lsquo;It is well wished,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now
hearken: by the valiant hand of the War-leader, by the hand that
shall unloose my girdle, I wish these twain to be as happy as we
be.&rsquo;
He made as if to draw her away, but she hung aback to set the
print of her foot beside the woman&rsquo;s foot, and then they
went on together, and soon crossed the Bridge, and came home to
the House of the Face.
When they had broken their fast, Face-of-god would straight
get to his business of ordering matters for the warfare, and was
wishful to speak with Folk-might; but found him not, either in
the House or the street.&nbsp; But a man said:
&lsquo;I saw the tall Guest come abroad from the House and go
toward the Bridge very early in the morning.&rsquo;
The Sun-beam, who was anigh when that was spoken, heard it and
smiled, and said: &lsquo;Gold-mane, deemest thou that it was my
brother whom we blessed?&rsquo;
&lsquo;I wot not,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;but I would he were
here, for this gear must speedily be looked to.&rsquo;
Nevertheless it was nigh an hour before Folk-might came home
to the House.&nbsp; He strode in lightly and gaily, and shaking
the crest of his war-helm as he went.&nbsp; He looked friendly on
Face-of-god, and said to him:
&lsquo;Thou hast been seeking me, War-leader; but grudge it
not that I have caused thee to tarry.&nbsp; For as things have
gone, I am p.
275twice the man for thine helping that I was yester-eve;
and thou art so ready and deft, that all will be done in due
time.&rsquo;
He looked as if he would have had Face-of-god ask of him what
made him so fain, but Face-of-god said only:
&lsquo;I am glad of thy gladness; but now let us dally no
longer, for I have many folk to see to-day and much to set
a-going.&rsquo;
So therewith they spake together a while, and then went their
ways together toward Carlstead and the Woodlanders.
CHAPTER XXXVI.&nbsp; FOLK-MIGHT SPEAKETH WITH THE BRIDE.
It must be told that those
footprints which Face-of-god and the Sun-beam had blessed betwixt
jest and earnest had more to do with them than they wotted
of.&nbsp; For Folk-might, who had had many thoughts and longings
since he had seen the Bride again, rose up early about sunrise,
and went out-a-doors, and wandered about the Burg, letting his
eyes stray over the goodly stone houses and their trim gardens,
yet noting them little, since the Bride was not there.
At last he came to where there was an open place,
straight-sided, longer than it was wide, with a wall on each side
of it, over which showed the blossomed boughs of pear and cherry
and plum-trees: on either hand before the wall was a row of great
lindens, now showing their first tender green, especially on
their lower twigs, where they were sheltered by the wall.&nbsp;
At the nether end of this place Folk-might saw a grey stone
house, and he went towards it betwixt the lindens, for it seemed
right great, and presently was but a score of paces from its
door, and as yet there was no man, carle or queen, stirring about
it.
It was a long low house with a very steep roof; but belike the
hall was built over some undercroft, for many steps went up to
the door on either hand; and the doorway was low, with a  a
name="page276">p. 276straight
lintel under its arch.&nbsp; This house, like the House of the
Face, seemed ancient and somewhat strange, and Folk-might could
not choose but take note of it.&nbsp; The front was all of good
ashlar work, but it was carven all over, without heed being paid
to the joints of the stones, into one picture of a flowery
meadow, with tall trees and bushes in it, and fowl perched in the
trees and running through the grass, and sheep and kine and oxen
and horses feeding down the meadow; and over the door at the top
of the stair was wrought a great steer bigger than all the other
neat, whose head was turned toward the sun-rising and uplifted
with open mouth, as though he were lowing aloud.&nbsp; Exceeding
fair seemed that house to Folk-might, and as though it were the
dwelling of some great kindred.
But he had scarce gone over it with his eyes, and was just
about to draw nigher yet to it, when the door at the top of those
steps opened, and a woman came out of the house clad in a green
kirtle and a gown of brazil, with a golden-hilted sword girt to
her side.&nbsp; Folk-might saw at once that it was the Bride, and
drew aback behind one of the trees so that she might not see him,
if she had not already seen him, as it seemed not that she had,
for she stayed but for a moment on the top of the stair, looking
out down the tree-rows, and then came down the stair and went
soberly along the road, passing so close to Folk-might that he
could see the fashion of her beauty closely, as one looks into
the work of some deftest artificer.&nbsp; Then it came suddenly
into his head that he would follow her and see whither she was
wending.&nbsp; &lsquo;At least,&rsquo; said he to himself,
&lsquo;if I come not to speech with her, I shall be nigh unto
her, and shall see somewhat of her beauty.&rsquo;
So he came out quietly from behind the tree, and followed her
softly; and he was clad in no garment save his kirtle, and bare
no weapons to clash and jingle, though he had his helm on his
head for lack of a softer hat.&nbsp; He kept her well in sight,
and she went straight onward and looked not back.&nbsp; She went
by the way p.
277whereas he had come, till they were in the main street,
wherein as yet was no one afoot; she made her way to the Bridge,
and passed over it into the meadows; but when she had gone but a
few steps, she stayed a little and looked on the ground, and as
she did so turned a little toward Folk-might, who had drawn back
into the last of the refuges over the up-stream buttresses.&nbsp;
He saw that there was a half-smile on her face, but he could not
tell whether she were glad or sorry.&nbsp; A light wind was
beginning to blow, that stirred her raiment and raised a lock of
hair that had strayed from the golden fillet round about her
head, and she looked most marvellous fair.
Now she looked along the grass that glittered under the beams
of the newly-risen sun, and noted belike how heavy the dew lay on
it; and the grass was high already, for the spring had been hot,
and haysel would be early in the Dale.&nbsp; So she put off her
shoes, that were of deerskin and broidered with golden threads,
and turned somewhat from the way, and hung them up amidst the new
green leaves of a hawthorn bush that stood nearby, and so went
thwart the meadow somewhat eastward straight from that bush, and
her feet shone out like pearls amidst the deep green grass.
Folk-might followed presently, and she stayed not again, nor
turned, nor beheld him; he recked not if she had, for then would
he have come up with her and hailed her, and he knew that she was
no foolish maiden to start at the sight of a man who was the
friend of her Folk.
So they went their ways till she came to the strand of the
water-meadow brook aforesaid, and she went through the little
ripples of the shallow without staying, and on through the tall
deep grass of the meadow beyond, to where they met the brook
again; for it swept round the meadow in a wide curve, and turned
back toward itself; so it was some half furlong over from water
to water.
She stood a while on the brink of the brook here, which was
brim-full and nigh running into the grass, because there was a
dam p. 278just
below the place; and Folk-might drew nigher to her under cover of
the thorn-bushes, and looked at the place about her and beyond
her.&nbsp; The meadow beyond stream was very fair and flowery,
but not right great; for it was bounded by a grove of ancient
chestnut trees, that went on and on toward the southern cliffs of
the Dale: in front of the chestnut wood stood a broken row of
black-thorn bushes, now growing green and losing their blossom,
and he could see betwixt them that there was a grassy bank
running along, as if there had once been a turf-wall and ditch
round about the chestnut trees.&nbsp; For indeed this was the old
place of tryst between Gold-mane and the Bride, whereof the tale
hath told before.
The Bride stayed scarce longer than gave him time to note all
this; but he deemed that she was weeping, though he could not
rightly see her face; for her shoulders heaved, and she hung her
face adown and put up her hands to it.&nbsp; But now she went a
little higher up the stream, where the water was shallower, and
waded the stream and went up over the meadow, still weeping, as
he deemed, and went between the black-thorn bushes, and sat her
down on the grassy bank with her back to the chestnut trees.
Folk-might was ashamed to have seen her weeping, and was
half-minded to turn him back again at once; but love constrained
him, and he said to himself, &lsquo;Where shall I see her again
privily if I pass by this time and place?&rsquo;&nbsp; So he
waited a little till he deemed she might have mastered the
passion of tears, and then came forth from his bush, and went
down to the water and crossed it, and went quietly over the
meadow straight towards her.&nbsp; But he was not half-way
across, when she lifted up her face from between her hands and
beheld the man coming.&nbsp; She neither started nor rose up; but
straightened herself as she sat, and looked right into
Folk-might&rsquo;s eyes as he drew near, though the tears were
not dry on her cheeks.
Now he stood before her, and said: &lsquo;Hail to the Daughter
of a mighty House!&nbsp; Mayst thou live happy!&rsquo;
p. 279She
answered: &lsquo;Hail to thee also, Guest of our Folk!&nbsp; Hast
thou been wandering about our meadows, and happened on me
perchance?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I saw thee come forth from
the House of the Steer, and I followed thee hither.&rsquo;
She reddened a little, and knit her brow, and said:
&lsquo;Thou wilt have something to say to me?&rsquo;
&lsquo;I have much to say to thee,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;yet
it was sweet to me to behold thee, even if I might not speak with
thee.&rsquo;
She looked on him with her deep simple eyes, and neither
reddened again, nor seemed wroth; then she said:
&lsquo;Speak what thou hast in thine heart, and I will hearken
without anger whatsoever it may be; even if thou hast but to tell
me of the passing folly of a mighty man, which in a month or two
he will not remember for sorrow or for joy.&nbsp; Sit here beside
me, and tell me thy thought.&rsquo;
So he sat him adown and said: &lsquo;Yea, I have much to say
to thee, but it is hard to me to say it.&nbsp; But this I will
say: to-day and yesterday make the third time I have seen
thee.&nbsp; The first time thou wert happy and calm, and no
shadow of trouble was on thee; the second time thine happy days
were waning, though thou scarce knewest it; but to-day and
yesterday thou art constrained by the bonds of grief, and
wouldest loosen them if thou mightest.&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;What meanest thou?&nbsp; How knowest thou
this?&nbsp; How may a stranger partake in my joy and my
sorrow?&rsquo;
He said: &lsquo;As for yesterday, all the people might see thy
grief and know it.&nbsp; But when I beheld thee the first time, I
saw thee that thou wert more fair and lovely than all other
women; and when I was away from thee, the thought of thee and
thine image were with me, and I might not put them away; and oft
at such and such a time I wondered and said to myself, what is
she doing now? though god wot I was dealing with tangles and
troubles and rough deeds enough.&nbsp; But the second time I
beheld thee, when I had looked to have great joy in the sight of
thee, my heart was p.
280smitten with a pang of grief; for I saw thee hanging on
the words and the looks of another man, who was light-minded
toward thee, and that thou wert troubled with the anguish of
doubt and fear.&nbsp; And he knew it not, nor saw it, though I
saw it.&rsquo;
Her face grew troubled, and the tearful passion stirred within
her.&nbsp; But she held it aback, and said, as anyone might have
said it:
&lsquo;How wert thou in the Dale, mighty man?&nbsp; We saw
thee not.&rsquo;
He said: &lsquo;I came hither hidden in other semblance than
mine own.&nbsp; But meddle not therewith; it availeth
nought.&nbsp; Let me say this, and do thou hearken to it.&nbsp; I
saw thee yesterday in the street, and thou wert as the ghost of
thine old gladness; although belike thou hast striven with
sorrow; for I see thee with a sword by thy side, and we have been
told that thou, O fairest of women, hast given thyself to the
Warrior to be his damsel.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that is sooth.&rsquo;
He went on: &lsquo;But the face which thou bearedst yesterday
against thy will, amidst all the people, that was because thou
hadst seen my sister the Sun-beam for the first time, and
Face-of-god with her, hand clinging to hand, lip longing for lip,
desire unsatisfied, but glad with all hope.&rsquo;
She laid hand upon hand in the lap of her gown, and looked
down, and her voice trembled as she said:
&lsquo;Doth it avail to talk of this?&rsquo;
He said: &lsquo;I know not: it may avail; for I am grieved,
and shall be whilst thou art grieved; and it is my wont to strive
with my griefs till I amend them.&rsquo;
She turned to him with kind eyes and said:
&lsquo;O mighty man, canst thou clear away the tangle which
besetteth the soul of her whose hope hath bewrayed her?&nbsp;
Canst thou make hope grow up in her heart?&nbsp; Friend, I will
tell thee that when I wed, I shall wed for the sake of the
kindred, hoping for no joy therein.&nbsp; Yea, or if by some
chance the desire of man came again into my heart, I should
strive with it to rid myself of it, for I should know of it that
it was but a wasting folly, that  span
class="pagenum">p. 281should but beguile me, and wound me,
and depart, leaving me empty of joy and heedless of
life.&rsquo;
He shook his head and said: &lsquo;Even so thou deemest now;
but one day it shall be otherwise.&nbsp; Or dost thou love thy
sorrow?&nbsp; I tell thee, as it wears thee and wears thee, thou
shalt hate it, and strive to shake it off.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay, nay,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;I love it not; for
not only it grieveth me, but also it beateth me down and
belittleth me.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Good is that,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know how
strong thine heart is.&nbsp; Now, wilt thou take mine hand, which
is verily the hand of thy friend, and remember what I have told
thee of my grief which cannot be sundered from thine?&nbsp; Shall
we not talk more concerning this?&nbsp; For surely I shall soon
see thee again, and often; since the Warrior, who loveth me
belike, leadeth thee into fellowship with me.&nbsp; Yea, I tell
thee, O friend, that in that fellowship shalt thou find both the
seed of hope, and the sun of desire that shall quicken
it.&rsquo;
Therewith he arose and stood before her, and held out to her
his hand all hardened with the sword-hilt, and she took it, and
stood up facing him, and said:
&lsquo;This much will I tell thee, O friend; that what I have
said to thee this hour, I thought not to have said to any man; or
to talk with a man of the grief that weareth me, or to suffer him
to see my tears; and marvellous I deem it of thee, for all thy
might, that thou hast drawn this speech from out of me, and left
me neither angry nor ashamed, in spite of these tears; and thou
whom I have known not, though thou knewest me!
&lsquo;But now it were best that thou depart, and get thee
home to the House of the Face, where I was once so frequent; for
I wot that thou hast much to do; and as thou sayest, it will be
in warfare that I shall see thee.&nbsp; Now I thank thee for thy
words and the thought thou hast had of me, and the pain which
thou hast taken to heal my hurt: I thank thee, I thank thee, for
as grievous as it is to show one&rsquo;s hurts even to a
friend.&rsquo;
p. 282He
said: &lsquo;O Bride, I thank thee for hearkening to my tale; and
one day shall I thank thee much more.&nbsp; Mayest thou fare well
in the Field and amidst the Folk!&rsquo;
Therewith he kissed her hand, and turned away, and went across
the meadow and the stream, glad at heart and blithe with
everyone; for kindness grew in him as gladness grew.
CHAPTER XXXVII.&nbsp; OF THE FOLK-MOTE OF THE DALESMEN, THE
SHEPHERD-FOLK, AND THE WOODLAND CARLES: THE BANNER OF THE WOLF
DISPLAYED.
Now came the day of the Great
Folk-mote, and there was much thronging from everywhere to the
Mote-stead, but most from Burgstead itself, whereas few of the
Dale-dwellers who had been at the Fair had gone back home.&nbsp;
Albeit some of the Shepherds and of the Dalesmen of the
westernmost Dale had brought light tents, and tilted themselves
in in the night before the Mote down in the meadows below the
Mote-stead.&nbsp; From early morning there had been a stream of
folk on the Portway setting westward; and many came thus early
that they might hold converse with friends and well-wishers; and
some that they might disport them in the woods.&nbsp; Men went in
no ordered bands, as the Burgstead men at least had done on the
day of the Weapon-show, save that a few of them who were arrayed
the bravest gathered about the banners, and went with them to the
Mote-stead; for all the banners must needs be there.
The Folk-mote was to be hallowed-in three hours before noon,
as all men knew; therefore an hour before that time were all men
of the Dale and the Shepherds assembled that might be looked for,
save the Alderman and the chieftains with the banner of the Burg,
and these were not like to come many minutes before the
Hallowing.&nbsp; Folk were gathered on the Field in such wise,
that the men-at-arms made a great ring round about the Doom-ring,
p. 283(albeit
there were many old men there, girt with swords that they should
never heave up again in battle), so that without that ring there
was nought save women and children.&nbsp; But when all the other
Houses were assembled, men looked around, and beheld the place of
the Woodlanders that it was empty; and they marvelled that they
were thus belated.&nbsp; For now all was ready, and a watcher had
gone up to the Tower on the height, and had with him the great
Horn of Warning, which could be heard past the Mote-stead and a
great way down the Dale: and if he saw foes coming from the East
he should blow one blast; if from the South, two; if from the
West, three; if from the North, four.
So half an hour from the appointed time of Hallowing rose the
rumour that the Alderman was on the road, and presently they of
the women who were on the outside of the throng, by drawing nigh
to the edge of the sheer rock, could behold the Banner of the
Burg on the Portway, and soon after could see the wain, done
about with green boughs, wherein sat the chieftains in their
glittering war-gear.&nbsp; Speedily they spread the tidings, and
a confused shout went up into the air; and in a little while the
wain stayed on Wildlake&rsquo;s Way at the bottom of the steep
slope that went up to the Mote-stead, and the banner of the Burg
came on proudly up the hill.&nbsp; Soon all men beheld it, and
saw that the tall Hall-face bore it in front of his brother
Face-of-god, who came on gleaming in war-gear better than most
men had seen; which was indeed of his father&rsquo;s fashioning,
and his father&rsquo;s gift to him that morning.
After Face-of-god came the Alderman, and with him Folk-might
leading the Sun-beam by the hand, and then Stone-face and the
Elder of the Dale-wardens; and then the six Burg-wardens: as to
the other Dale-wardens, they were in their places on the
Field.
So now those who had been standing up turned their faces
toward the Altar of the Gods, and those who had been sitting down
sprang to their feet, and the confused rumour of the throng rose
p. 284into a
clear shout as the chieftains went to their places, and sat them
down on the turf-seats amidst the Doom-ring facing the
Speech-hill and the Altar of the Gods.&nbsp; Amidmost sat the
Alderman, on his right hand Face-of-god, and out from him
Hall-face, and then Stone-face and three of the Wardens; but on
his left hand sat first the two Guests, then the Elder of the
Dale-wardens, and then the other three Burg-wardens; as for the
Banner of the Burg, its staff was stuck into the earth behind
them, and the Banner raised itself in the morning wind and
flapped and rippled over their heads.
There then they sat, and folk abided, and it still lacked some
minutes of the due time, as the Alderman wotted by the shadow of
the great standing-stone betwixt him and the Altar.&nbsp;
Therewithal came the sound of a great horn from out of the wood
on the north side, and men knew it for the horn of the Woodland
Carles, and were glad; for they could not think why they should
be belated; and now men stood up a-tiptoe and on other&rsquo;s
shoulders to look over the heads of the women and children to
behold their coming; but their empty place was at the southwest
corner of the ring of men.
So presently men beheld them marching toward their place,
cleaving the throng of the women and children, a great company;
for besides that they had with them two score more of men under
weapons than on the day of the Weapon-show, all their little ones
and women and outworn elders were with them, some on foot, some
riding on oxen and asses.&nbsp; In their forefront went the two
signs of the Battle-shaft and the War-spear.&nbsp; But moreover,
in front of all was borne a great staff with the cloth of a
banner wrapped round about it, and tied up with a hempen yarn
that it might not be seen.
Stark and mighty men they looked; tall and lean,
broad-shouldered, dark-faced.&nbsp; As they came amongst the
throng the voice of their horn died out, and for a few moments
they fared on with no sound save the tramp of their feet; then
all at once p.
285the man who bare the hidden banner lifted up one hand,
and straightway they fell to singing, and with that song they
came to their place.&nbsp; And this is some of what they
sang:
O white, white Sun, what things of wonder
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hast thou beheld from thy wall of the sky!
All the Roofs of the Rich and the grief thereunder,
&nbsp;&nbsp; As the fear of the Earl-folk flitteth by!
Thou hast seen the Flame steal forth from the
Forest
&nbsp;&nbsp; To slay the slumber of the lands,
As the Dusky Lord whom thou abhorrest
&nbsp;&nbsp; Clomb up to thy Burg unbuilt with hands.
Thou lookest down from thy door the golden, br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor batest thy wide-shining mirth,
As the ramparts fall, and the roof-trees olden
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lie smouldering low on the burning earth.
When flitteth the half-dark night of summer br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the face of the murder great and grim,
&rsquo;Tis thou thyself and no new-comer
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shines golden-bright on the deed undim.
Art thou our friend, O Day-dawn&rsquo;s
Lover?
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full oft thine hand hath sent aslant
Bright beams athwart the Wood-bear&rsquo;s cover,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the feeble folk and the nameless haunt.
Thou hast seen us quail, thou hast seen us
cower,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou hast seen us crouch in the Green Abode,
While for us wert thou slaying slow hour by hour,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And smoothing down the war-rough road.
p.
286Yea, the rocks of the Waste were thy Dawns
upheaving,
&nbsp;&nbsp; To let the days of the years go through;
And thy Noons the tangled brake were cleaving
&nbsp;&nbsp; The slow-foot seasons&rsquo; deed to do.
Then gaze adown on this gift of our giving, br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Wolf comes
wending frith and ford,
And the Folk fares forth from the dead to the living,
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the love of the Lief by the light of the
Sword.
Then ceased the song, and the whole band of the Woodlanders
came pouring tumultuously into the space allotted them, like the
waters pouring over a river-dam, their white swords waving aloft
in the morning sunlight; and wild and strange cries rose up from
amidst them, with sobbing and weeping of joy.&nbsp; But soon
their troubled front sank back into ordered ranks, their bright
blades stood upright in their hands before them, and folk looked
on their company, and deemed it the very Terror of battle and
Render of the ranks of war.&nbsp; Right well were they armed; for
though many of their weapons were ancient and somewhat worn, yet
were they the work of good smiths of old days; and moreover, if
any of them lacked good war-gear of his own, that had the
Alderman and his sons made good to them.
But before the hedge of steel stood the two tall men who held
in their hands the war-tokens of the Battle-shaft and the
War-spear, and betwixt them stood one who was indeed the tallest
man of the whole assembly, who held the great staff of the hidden
banner.&nbsp; And now he reached up his hand, and plucked at the
yarn that bound it, which of set purpose was but feeble, and tore
it off, and then shook the staff aloft with both hands, and
shouted, and lo! the Banner of the Wolf with the Sun-burst behind
him, glittering-bright, new-woven by the women of the kindred,
ran out in the fresh wind, and flapped and rippled before His
warriors there assembled.
p. 287Then
from all over the Mote-stead arose an exceeding great shout, and
all men waved aloft their weapons; but the men of Shadowy Vale
who were standing amidst the men of the Face knew not how to
demean themselves, and some of them ran forth into the Field and
leapt for joy, tossing their swords into the air, and catching
them by the hilts as they fell: and amidst it all the Woodlanders
now stood silent, unmoving, as men abiding the word of onset.
As for that brother and sister: the Sun-beam flushed red all
over her face, and pressed her hands to her bosom, and then the
passion of tears over-mastered her, and her breast heaved, and
the tears gushed out of her eyes, and her body was shaken with
weeping.&nbsp; But Folk-might sat still, looking straight before
him, his eyes glittering, his teeth set, his right hand clutching
hard at the hilts of his sword, which lay naked across his
knees.&nbsp; And the Bride, who stood clad in her begemmed and
glittering war-array in the forefront of the Men of the Steer,
nigh unto the seats of the chieftains, beheld Folk-might, and her
face flushed and brightened, and still she looked upon him.&nbsp;
The Alderman&rsquo;s face was as of one pleased and proud; yet
was its joy shadowed as it were by a cloud of compassion.&nbsp;
Face-of-god sat like the very image of the War-god, and stirred
not, nor looked toward the Sun-beam; for still the thought of the
after-grief of battle, and the death of friends and folk that
loved him, lay heavy on his heart, for all that it beat wildly at
the shouting of the men.
CHAPTER XXXVIII.&nbsp; OF THE GREAT FOLK-MOTE: ATONEMENTS
GIVEN, AND MEN MADE SACKLESS.
Amidst the clamour uprose the
Alderman; for it was clear to all men that the Folk-mote should
be holden at once, and the matters of the War, and the
Fellowship, and the choosing of the War-leader, speedily dealt
with.&nbsp; So the Alderman fell  span
class="pagenum">p. 288to hallowing in the Folk-mote: he
went up to the Altar of the Gods, and took the Gold-ring off it,
and did it on his arm; then he drew his sword and waved it toward
the four a&iacute;rts, and spake; and the noise and shouting
fell, and there was silence but for him:
&lsquo;Herewith I hallow in this Folk-mote of the Men of the
Dale and the Sheepcotes and the Woodland, in the name of the
Warrior and the Earth-god and the Fathers of the kindreds.&nbsp;
Now let not the peace of the Mote be broken.&nbsp; Let not man
rise against man, or bear blade or hand, or stick or stone
against any.&nbsp; If any man break the Peace of the Holy Mote,
let him be a man accursed, a wild-beast in the Holy Places; an
outcast from home and hearth, from bed and board, from mead and
acre; not to be holpen with bread, nor flesh, nor wine; nor flax,
nor wool, nor any cloth; nor with sword, nor shield, nor axe, nor
plough-share; nor with horse, nor ox, nor ass; with no
saddle-beast nor draught-beast; nor with wain, nor boat, nor
way-leading; nor with fire nor water; nor with any world&rsquo;s
wealth.&nbsp; Thus let him who hath cast out man be cast out by
man.&nbsp; Now is hallowed-in the Folk-mote of the Men of the
Dale and the Sheepcotes and the Woodlands.&rsquo;
Therewith he waved his sword again toward the four
a&iacute;rts, and went and sat down in his place.&nbsp; But
presently he arose again, and said:
&lsquo;Now if man hath aught to say against man, and claimeth
boot of any, or would lay guilt on any man&rsquo;s head, let him
come forth and declare it; and the judges shall be named, and the
case shall be tried this afternoon or to-morrow.&nbsp; Yet first
I shall tell you that I, the Alderman of the Dalesmen, doomed one
Iron-face of the House of the Face to pay a double fine, for that
he drew a sword at the Gate-thing of Burgstead with the intent to
break the peace thereof.&nbsp; Thou, Green-sleeve, bring forth
the peace-breaker&rsquo;s fine, that Iron-face may lay the same
on the Altar.&rsquo;
Then came forth a man from the men of the Face bearing a bag,
and he brought it to Iron-face, who went up to the Altar and
poured forth weighed gold from the bag thereon, and said:
p.
289&lsquo;Warden of the Dale, come thou and weigh
it!&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; quoth the Warden, &lsquo;it needeth not, no
man here doubteth thee, Alderman Iron-face.&rsquo;
A murmur of yeasay went up, and none had a word to say against
the Alderman, but they praised him rather: also men were eager to
hear of the war, and the fellowship, and to be done with these
petty matters.&nbsp; Then the Alderman rose again and said:
&lsquo;Hath any man a grief against any other of the Kindreds
of the Dale, or the Sheepcotes, or the Woodlands?&rsquo;
None answered or stirred; so after he had waited a while, he
said:
&lsquo;Is there any who hath any guilt to lay against a
Stranger, an Outlander, being such a man as he deems we can come
at?&rsquo;
Thereat was a stir amongst the Men of the Fleece of the
Shepherds, and their ranks opened, and there came forth an
ill-favoured lean old man, long-nebbed, blear-eyed, and bent,
girt with a rusty old sword, but not otherwise armed.&nbsp; And
all men knew Penny-thumb, who had been ransacked last
autumn.&nbsp; As he came forth, it seemed as if his neighbours
had been trying to hold him back; but a stout, broad-shouldered
man, black-haired and red-bearded, made way for the old man, and
led him out of the throng, and stood by him; and this man was
well armed at all points, and looked a doughty carle.&nbsp; He
stood side by side with Penny-thumb, right in front of the men of
his house, and looked about him at first somewhat uneasily, as
though he were ashamed of his fellow; but though many smiled,
none laughed aloud; and they forbore, partly because they knew
the man to be a good man, partly because of the solemn tide of
the Folk-mote, and partly in sooth because they wished all this
to be over, and were as men who had no time for empty mirth.
Then said the Alderman: &lsquo;What wouldest thou,
Penny-thumb, and thou, Bristler, son of Brightling?&rsquo;
Then Penny-thumb began to speak in a high squeaky voice:  a
name="page290">p.
290&lsquo;Alderman, and Lord of the Folk!&rsquo;&nbsp; But
therewithal Bristle, pulled him back, and said:
&lsquo;I am the man who hath taken this quarrel upon me, and
have sworn upon the Holy Boar to carry this feud through; and we
deem, Alderman, that if they who slew Rusty and ransacked
Penny-thumb be not known now, yet they soon may be.&rsquo;
As he spake, came forth those three men of the Shepherds and
the two Dalesmen who had sworn with him on the Holy Boar.&nbsp;
Then up stood Folk-might, and came forth into the field, and
said:
&lsquo;Bristler, son of Brightling, and ye other good men and
true, it is but sooth that the ransackers and the slayer may soon
be known; and here I declare them unto you: I it was and none
other who slew Rusty; and I was the leader of those who ransacked
Penny-thumb, and cowed Harts-bane of Greentofts.&nbsp; As for the
slaying of Rusty, I slew him because he chased me, and would not
forbear, so that I must either slay or be slain, as hath befallen
me erewhile, and will befall again, methinks.&nbsp; As for the
ransacking of Penny-thumb, I needed the goods that I took, and he
needed them not, since he neither used them, nor gave them away,
and, they being gone, he hath lived no worser than
aforetime.&nbsp; Now I say, that if ye will take the outlawry off
me, which, as I hear, ye laid upon me, not knowing me, then will
I handsel self-doom to thee, Bristler, if thou wilt bear thy
grief to purse, and I will pay thee what thou wilt out of hand;
or if perchance thou wilt call me to Holm, thither will I go, if
thou and I come unslain out of this war.&nbsp; As to the
ransacking and cowing of Harts-bane, I say that I am sackless
therein, because the man is but a ruffler and a man of violence,
and hath cowed many men of the Dale; and if he gainsay me, then
do I call him to the Holm after this war is over; either him or
any man who will take his place before my sword.&rsquo;
Then he held his peace, and man spake to man, and a murmur
arose, as they said for the more part that it was a fair and
manly offer.&nbsp; But Bristler called his fellows and
Penny-thumb to him,  span
class="pagenum">p. 291and they spake together; and
sometimes Penny-thumb&rsquo;s shrill squeak was heard above the
deep-voiced talk of the others; for he was a man that harboured
malice.&nbsp; But at last Bristler spake out and said:
&lsquo;Tall man, we know that thou art a chieftain and of good
will to the men of the Dale and their friends, and that want
drave thee to the ransacking, and need to the manslaying, and
neither the living nor the dead to whom thou art guilty are to be
called good men; therefore will I bring the matter to purse, if
thou wilt handsel me self-doom.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, even so let it be,&rsquo; quoth Folk-might; and
stepped forward and took Bristler by the hand, and handselled him
self-doom.&nbsp; Then said Bristler:
&lsquo;Though Rusty was no good man, and though he followed
thee to slay thee, yet was he in his right therein, since he was
following up his goodman&rsquo;s gear; therefore shalt thou pay a
full blood-wite for him, that is to say, the worth of three
hundreds in weed-stuff in whatso goods thou wilt.&nbsp; As for
the ransacking of Penny-thumb, he shall deem himself well paid if
thou give him our hundreds in weed-stuff for that which thou
didst borrow of him.&rsquo;
Then Penny-thumb set up his squeak again, but no man hearkened
to him, and each man said to his neighbour that it was well
doomed of Bristler, and neither too much nor too little.&nbsp;
But Folk-might bade Wood-wont to bring thither to him that which
he had borne to the Mote; and he brought forth a big sack, and
Folk-might emptied it on the earth, and lo! the silver rings of
the slain felons, and they lay in a heap on the green field, and
they were the best of silver.&nbsp; Then the Elder of the
Dale-wardens weighed out from the heap the blood-wite for Rusty,
according to the due measure of the hundred in weed-stuff, and
delivered it unto Bristler.&nbsp; And Folk-might said:
&lsquo;Draw nigh now, Penny-thumb, and take what thou wilt of
this gear, which I need not, and grudge not at me
henceforward.&rsquo;
But Penny-thumb was afraid, and abode where he was; and  a
name="page292">p. 292Bristler
laughed, and said: &lsquo;Take it, goodman, take it; spare not
other men&rsquo;s goods as thou dost thine own.&rsquo;
And Folk-might stood by, smiling faintly: so Penny-thumb
plucked up a heart, and drew nigh trembling, and took what he
durst from that heap; and all that stood by said that he had
gotten a full double of what had been awarded to him.&nbsp; But
as for him, he went his ways straight from the Mote-stead, and
made no stay till he had gotten him home, and laid the silver up
in a strong coffer; and thereafter he bewailed him sorely that he
had not taken the double of that which he took, since none would
have said him nay.
When he was gone, the Alderman arose and said:
&lsquo;Now, since the fines have been paid duly and freely,
according to the dooming of Bristler, take we off the outlawry
from Folk-might and his fellows, and account them to be sackless
before us.&rsquo;
Then he called for other cases; but no man had aught more to
bring forward against any man, either of the kindreds or the
Strangers.
CHAPTER XXXIX.&nbsp; OF THE GREAT FOLK-MOTE: MEN TAKE REDE OF
THE WAR-FARING, THE FELLOWSHIP, AND THE WAR-LEADER.&nbsp;
FOLK-MIGHT TELLETH WHENCE HIS PEOPLE CAME.&nbsp; THE FOLK-MOTE
SUNDERED.
Now a great silence fell upon the
throng, and they stood as men abiding some new matter.&nbsp; Unto
them arose the Alderman, and said:
&lsquo;Men of the Dale, and ye Shepherds and Woodlanders; it
is well known to you that we have foemen in the wood and beyond
it; and now have we gotten sure tidings, that they will not abide
at home or in the wood, but are minded to fall upon us at
home.&nbsp; Now therefore I will not ask you whether ye will have
peace p. 293or
war; for with these foemen ye may have peace no otherwise save by
war.&nbsp; But if ye think with me, three things have ye to
determine: first, whether ye will abide your foes in your own
houses, or will go meet them at theirs; next, whether ye will
take to you as fellows in arms a valiant folk of the children of
the Gods, who are foemen to our foemen; and lastly, what man ye
will have to be your War-leader.&nbsp; Now, I bid all those here
assembled, to speak hereof, any man of them that will, either
what they may have conceived in their own minds, or what their
kindred may have put into their mouths to speak.&rsquo;
Therewith he sat down, and in a little while came forth old
Hall-ward of the House of the Steer, and stood before the
Alderman, and said: &lsquo;O Alderman, all we say: Since war is
awake we will not tarry, but will go meet our foes while it is
yet time.&nbsp; The valiant men of whom thou tellest shall be our
fellows, were there but three of them.&nbsp; We know no better
War-leader than Face-of-god of the House of the Face.&nbsp; Let
him lead us.&rsquo;
Therewith he went his ways; and next came forth War-well, and
said: &lsquo;The House of the Bridge would have Face-of-god for
War-leader, these tall men for fellows, and the shortest way to
meet the foe.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he went back to his place.
Next came Fox of Upton, and said: &lsquo;Time presses, or much
might be spoken.&nbsp; Thus saith the House of the Bull: Let us
go meet the foe, and take these valiant strangers for
way-leaders, and Face-of-god for War-leader.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he
also went back again.
Then came forth two men together, an old man and a young, and
the old man spake as soon as he stood still: &lsquo;The Men of
the Vine bid me say their will: They will not stay at home to
have their houses burned over their heads, themselves slain on
their own hearths, and their wives haled off to thralldom.&nbsp;
They will take any man for their fellow in arms who will smite
stark strokes on their side.&nbsp; They know Face-of-god, and
were liefer of him for War-leader than any other, and they will
follow him wheresoever he leadeth.&nbsp; Thus my kindred biddeth
me say, and I hight  span
class="pagenum">p. 294Fork-beard of Lea.&nbsp; If I live
through this war, I shall have lived through five.&rsquo;
Therewith he went back to his place; but the young man lifted
up his voice and said: &lsquo;To all this I say yea, and so am I
bidden by the kindred of the Sickle.&nbsp; I am Red-beard of the
Knolls, the son of my father.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he went to his
place again.
Then came forth Stone-face, and said: &lsquo;The House of the
Face saith: Lead us through the wood, O Face-of-god, thou
War-leader, and ye warriors of the Wolf.&nbsp; I am Stone-face,
as men know, and this word hath been given to me by the
kindred.&rsquo;&nbsp; And he took his place again.
Then came forth together the three chiefs of the Shepherds, to
wit Hound-under-Greenbury, Strongitharm, and the Hyllier; and
Strongitharm spake for all three, and said:
&lsquo;The Men of Greenbury, and they of the Fleece and the
Thorn, are of one accord, and bid us say that they are well
pleased to have Face-of-god for War-leader; and that they will
follow him and the warriors of the Wolf to live or die with them;
and that they are ready to go meet the foe at once, and will not
skulk behind the walls of Greenbury.&rsquo;
Therewith the three went back again to their places.
Then came forth that tall man that bare the Banner of the
Wolf, when he had given the staff into the hands of him who stood
next.&nbsp; He came and stood over against the seat of the
chieftains; and for a while he could say no word, but stood
struggling with the strong passion of his joy; but at last he
lifted his hands aloft, and cried out in a loud voice:
&lsquo;O war, war!&nbsp; O death!&nbsp; O wounding and
grief!&nbsp; O loss of friends and kindred! let all this be
rather than the drawing back of meeting hands and the sundering
of yearning hearts!&rsquo; and he went back hastily to his
place.&nbsp; But from the ranks of the Woodlanders ran forth a
young man, and cried out:
&lsquo;As is the word of Red-wolf, so is my word, Bears-bane
of Carlstead; and this is the word which our little Folk hath put
p. 295into our
mouths; and O! that our hands may show the meaning of our mouths;
for nought else can.&rsquo;
Then indeed went up a great shout, though many forebore to cry
out; for now were they too much moved for words or sounds.&nbsp;
And in special was Face-of-god moved; and he scarce knew which
way to look, lest he should break out into sobs and weeping; for
of late he had been much among the Woodlanders, and loved them
much.
Then all the noise and clamour fell, and it was to men as if
they who had come thither a folk, had now become an host of
war.
But once again the Alderman rose up and spake:
&lsquo;Now have ye yeasaid three things: That we take
Face-of-god of the House of the Face for our War-leader; that we
fare under weapons at once against them who would murder us; and
that we take the valiant Folk of the Wolf for our fellows in
arms.&rsquo;
Therewith he stayed his speech, and this time the shout arose
clear and most mighty, with the tossing up of swords and the
clashing of weapons on shields.
Then he said: &lsquo;Now, if any man will speak, here is the
War-leader, and here is the chief of our new friends, to answer
to whatso any of the kindred would have answered.&rsquo;
Thereon came forth the Fiddle from amongst the Men of the
Sickle, and drew somewhat nigh to the Alderman, and said:
&lsquo;Alderman, we would ask of the War-leader if he hath
devised the manner of our assembling, and the way of our
war-faring, and the day of our hosting.&nbsp; More than this I
will not ask of him, because we wot that in so great an assembly
it may be that the foe may have some spy of whom we wot not; and
though this be not likely, yet some folk may babble; therefore it
is best for the wise to be wise everywhere and always.&nbsp;
Therefore my rede it is, that no man ask any more concerning
this, but let it lie with the War-leader to bring us face to face
with the foe as speedily as he may.&rsquo;
All men said that this was well counselled.&nbsp; But
Face-of-god p.
296arose and said: &lsquo;Ye Men of the Dale, ye Shepherds
and Woodlanders, meseemeth the Fiddle hath spoken wisely.&nbsp;
Now therefore I answer him and say, that I have so ordered
everything since the Gate-thing was holden at Burgstead, that we
may come face to face with the foemen by the shortest of
roads.&nbsp; Every man shall be duly summoned to the Hosting, and
if any man fail, let it be accounted a shame to him for
ever.&rsquo;
A great shout followed on his words, and he sat down
again.&nbsp; But Fox of Upton came forth and said:
&lsquo;O Alderman, we have yeasaid the fellowship of the
valiant men who have come to us from out of the waste; but this
we have done, not because we have known them, otherwise than by
what our kinsman Face-of-god hath told us concerning them, but
because we have seen clearly that they will be of much avail to
us in our warfare.&nbsp; Now, therefore, if the tall chieftain
who sitteth beside thee were to do us to wit what he is, and
whence he and his are come, it were well, and fain were we
thereof; but if he listeth not to tell us, that also shall be
well.&rsquo;
Then arose Folk-might in his place; but or ever he could open
his mouth to speak, the tall Red-wolf strode forward bearing with
him the Banner of the Wolf and the Sun-burst, and came and stood
beside him; and the wind ran through the folds of the banner, and
rippled it out above the heads of those twain.&nbsp; Then
Folk-might spake and said:
&lsquo;O Men of the Dale and the Sheepcotes, I
will do as ye bid me do;
And fain were ye of the story if every deal ye knew.
But long, long were its telling, were I to tell it all:
Let it bide till the Cup of Deliverance ye drink from hall to
hall.

&lsquo;Like you we be of the kindreds, of the Sons of the Gods we
come,
Midst the Mid-earth&rsquo;s mighty Woodland of old we had our
home;
But of older time we abided &rsquo;neath the mountains of the
Earth,
O&rsquo;er which the Sun ariseth to waken woe and mirth.

p. 297Great
were we then and many; but the long days wore us thin,
And war, wherein the winner hath weary work to win.
And the woodland wall behind us e&rsquo;en like ourselves was
worn,
And the tramp of the hosts of the foemen adown its glades was
borne
On the wind that bent our wheat-fields.&nbsp; So in the morn we
rose,
And left behind the stubble and the autumn-fruited close,
And went our ways to the westward, nor turned aback to see
The glare of our burning houses rise over brake and tree.
But the foe was fierce and speedy, nor long they tarried
there,
And through the woods of battle our laden wains must fare;
And the Sons of the Wolf were minished, and the maids of the Wolf
waxed few,
As amidst the victory-singing we fared the wild-wood through. br
/>

&lsquo;So saith the ancient story, that west and west we went, br
/>
And many a day of battle we had in brake, on bent;
Whilst here a while we tarried, and there we hastened on,
And still the battle-harvest from many a folk we won.

&lsquo;Of the tale of the days who wotteth?&nbsp; Of the years
what man can tell,
While the Sons of the Wolf were wandering, and knew not where to
dwell?
But at last we clomb the mountains, and mickle was our toil, br
/>
As high the spear-wood clambered of the drivers of the spoil; br
/>
And tangled were the passes and the beacons flared behind,
And the horns of gathering onset came up upon the wind.
So saith the ancient story, that we stood in a mountain-cleft, br
/>
Where the ways and the valleys sundered to the right hand and the
left.
There in the place of sundering all woeful was the rede;
We knew no land before us, and behind was heavy need.
As the sword cleaves through the byrny, so there the mountain
flank
Cleft through the God-kin&rsquo;s people; and ne&rsquo;er again
we drank
p. 298The wine
of war together, or feasted side by side
In the Feast-hall of the Warrior on the fruit of the
battle-tide.
For there we turned and sundered; unto the North we went
And up along the waters, and the clattering stony bent;
And unto the South and the Sheepcotes down went our
sister&rsquo;s sons;
And O for the years passed over since we saw those valiant
ones!&rsquo;
He ceased, and laid his right hand on the banner-staff a
little below the left hand of Red-wolf; and men were so keen to
hear each word that he spake, that there was no cry nor sound of
voices when he had done, only the sound of the rippling banner of
the Wolf over the heads of those twain.&nbsp; The Sun-beam bowed
her head now, and wept silently.&nbsp; But the Bride, she had
drawn her sword, and held it upright in her hand before her, and
the sun smote fire from out of it.
Then it was but a little while before Red-wolf lifted up his
voice, and sang:
&lsquo;Hearken a wonder, O Folk of the
Field,
How they that did sunder stand shield beside shield!
Lo! the old wont and manner by fearless folk
made,
On the Bole of the Banner the brothers&rsquo; hands laid.
Lo! here the token of what hath betid!
Grown whole is the broken, found that which was hid.
Now one way we follow whate&rsquo;er shall
befall;
As seeketh the swallow his yesteryear&rsquo;s hall.
Seldom folk fewer to fight-stead hath fared; br
/>
Ne&rsquo;er have men truer the battle-reed bared.
Grey locks now I carry, and old am I grown, br
/>
Nor looked I to tarry to meet with mine own.
p.
299For we who remember the deeds of old days
Were nought but the ember of battle ablaze.
For what man might aid us? what deed and what
day
Should come where Weird laid us aloof from the way?
What man save that other of Twain rent
apart,
Our war-friend, our Brother, the piece of our heart.
Then hearken the wonder how shield beside
shield
The twain that did sunder wend down to the Field!&rsquo;
Now when he had made an end, men could no longer forebear the
shout; and it went up into the heavens, and was borne by the
west-wind down the Dale to the ears of the stay-at-home women and
men unmeet to go abroad, and it quickened their blood and the
spirits within them as they heard it, and they smiled and were
fain; for they knew that their kinsfolk were glad.
But when there was quiet on the Mote-field again, Folk-might
spake again and said;
&lsquo;It is sooth that my Brother sayeth, and
that now again we wend,
All the Sons of the Wolf together, till the trouble hath an
end.
But as for that tale of the Ancients, it saith that we who
went
To the northward, climbed and stumbled o&rsquo;er many a stony
bent,
Till we happed on that isle of the waste-land, and the grass of
Shadowy Vale,
Where we dwelt till we throve a little, and felt our might
avail.
Then we fared abroad from the shadow and the little-lighted
hold,
And the increase fell to the valiant, and the spoil to the
battle-bold,
And never a man gainsaid us with the weapons in our hands;
And in Silver-dale the happy we gat us life and lands.
&lsquo;So wore the years o&rsquo;er-wealthy;
and meseemeth that ye know
How we sowed and reaped destruction, and the Day of the
overthrow:
p. 300How we
leaned on the staff we had broken, and put our lives in the
hand
Of those whom we had vanquished and the feeble of the land;
And these were the stone of stumbling, and the burden not to be
borne,
When the battle-blast fell on us and our day was over-worn.
Thus then did our wealth bewray us, and left us wise and sad; br
/>
And to you, bold men, it falleth once more to make us glad,
If so your hearts are bidding, and ye deem the deed of worth. br
/>
Such were we; what we shall be, &rsquo;tis yours to say
henceforth.&rsquo;
He said furthermore: &lsquo;How great we have been I have told
you already; and ye shall see for yourselves how little we be
now.&nbsp; Is it enough, and will ye have us for friends and
brothers?&nbsp; How say ye?&rsquo;
They answered with shout upon shout, so that all the place and
the wild-wood round about was full of the voice of their crying;
but when the clamour fell, then spake the Alderman and said:
&lsquo;Friend, and chieftain of the Wolf, thou mayst hear by
this shouting of the people that we have no mind to naysay our
yea-say.&nbsp; And know that it is not our use and manner to seek
the strong for friends, and to thrust aside the weak; but rather
to choose for our friends them who are of like mind to us, men in
whom we put our trust.&nbsp; From henceforth then there is
brotherhood between us; we are yours, and ye are ours; and let
this endure for ever!&rsquo;
Then were all men full of joy; and now at last the battle
seemed at hand, and the peace beyond the battle.
Then men brought the hallowed beasts all garlanded with
flowers into the Doom-ring, and there were they slain and offered
up unto the Gods, to wit the Warrior, the Earth-god, and the
Fathers; and thereafter was solemn feast holden on the Field of
the Folk-mote, and all men were fain and merry.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, not all men abode there the feast through; for or
ever the afternoon was well worn, were many men wending along the
Portway p.
301eastward toward the Upper Dale, each man in his
war-gear and with a scrip hung about him; and these were they who
were bound for the trysting-place and the journey over the
waste.
So the Folk-mote was sundered; and men went to their houses,
and there abode in peace the time of their summoning; since they
wotted well that the Hosting was afoot.
But as for the Woodlanders, who were at the Mote-stead with
all their folk, women, children, and old men, they went not back
again to Carlstead; but prayed the neighbours of the Middle Dale
to suffer them to abide there awhile, which they yeasaid with a
good will.&nbsp; So the Woodlanders tilted themselves in, the
more part of them, down in the meadows below the Mote-stead,
along either side of Wildlake&rsquo;s Way; but their ancient
folk, and some of the women and children, the neighbours would
have into their houses, and the rest they furnished with victual
and all that they needed without price, looking upon them as
their very guests.&nbsp; For indeed they deemed that they could
see that these men would never return to Carlstead, but would
abide with the Men of the Wolf in Silver-dale, once it were
won.&nbsp; And this they deemed but meet and right, yet were they
sorry thereof; for the Woodlanders were well beloved of all the
Dalesmen; and now that they had gotten to know that they were
come of so noble a kindred, they were better beloved yet, and
more looked upon.
CHAPTER XL.&nbsp; OF THE HOSTING IN SHADOWY VALE.
It was on the evening of the fourth
day after the Folk-mote that there came through the Waste to the
rocky edge of Shadowy Vale a band of some fifteen score of
men-at-arms, and with them a multitude of women and children and
old men, some afoot, some riding on asses and bullocks; and with
them were sumpter asses and neat laden with household goods, and
a few goats and kine.&nbsp; And this was the whole folk of the
Woodlanders come p.
302to the Hosting in Shadowy Vale and the Home of the
Children of the Wolf.&nbsp; Their leaders of the way were
Wood-father and Wood-wont and two other carles of Shadowy Vale;
and Red-wolf the tall, and Bears-bane and War-grove were the
captains and chieftains of their company.
Thus then they entered into the narrow pass aforesaid, which
was the ingate to the Vale from the Waste, and little by little
its dimness swallowed up their long line.&nbsp; As they went by
the place where the lowering of the rock-wall gave a glimpse of
the valley, they looked down into it as Face-of-god had done, but
much change was there in little time.&nbsp; There was the black
wall of crags on the other side stretching down to the ghyll of
the great Force; there ran the deep green waters of the Shivering
Flood; but the grass which Face-of-god had seen naked of
everything but a few kine, thereon now the tents of men stood
thick.&nbsp; Their hearts swelled within them as they beheld it,
but they forebore the shout and the cry till they should be well
within the Vale, and so went down silently into the
darkness.&nbsp; But as their eyes caught that dim image of the
Wolf on the wall of the pass, man pointed it out to man, and not
a few turned and kissed it hurriedly; and to them it seemed that
many a kiss had been laid on that dear token since the days of
old, and that the hard stone had been worn away by the fervent
lips of men, and that the air of the mirk place yet quivered with
the vows sworn over the sword-blade.
But down through the dark they went, and so came on to the
stony scree at the end of the pass and into the Vale; and the
whole Folk save the three chieftains flowed over it and stood
about it down on the level grass of the Vale.&nbsp; But those
three stood yet on the top of the scree, bearing the war-signs of
the Shaft and the Spear, and betwixt them the banner of the Wolf
and the Sunburst newly displayed to the winds of Shadowy
Vale.
Up and down the Vale they looked, and saw before the tents of
men the old familiar banners of Burgdale rising and falling in
the evening wind.&nbsp; But amidst of the Doom-ring was pitched a
p. 303great
banner, whereon was done the image of the Wolf with red gaping
jaws on a field of green; and about him stood other banners, to
wit, The Silver Arm on a red field, the Red Hand on a white
field, and on green fields both, the Golden Bushel and the Ragged
Sword.
All about the plain shone glittering war-gear of men as they
moved hither and thither, and a stream of folk began at once to
draw toward the scree to look on those new-comers; and amidst the
helmed Burgdalers and the white-coated Shepherds went the tall
men of the Wolf, bare-headed and unarmed save for their swords,
mingled with the fair strong women of the kindred, treading
barefoot the soft grass of their own Vale.
Presently there was a great throng gathered round about the
Woodlanders, and each man as he joined it waved hand or weapon
toward them, and the joy of their welcome sent a confused clamour
through the air.&nbsp; Then forth from the throng stepped
Folk-might, unarmed save his sword, and behind him was
Face-of-god, in his war-gear save his helm, hand in hand with the
Sun-beam, who was clad in her goodly flowered green kirtle, her
feet naked like her sisters of the kindred.
Then Folk-might cried aloud: &lsquo;A full and free greeting
to our brothers!&nbsp; Well be ye, O Sons of our Ancient
Fathers!&nbsp; And to-day are ye the dearer to us because we see
that ye have brought us a gift, to wit, your wives and children,
and your grandsires unmeet for war.&nbsp; By this token we see
how great is your trust in us, and that it is your meaning never
to sunder from us again.&nbsp; O well be ye; well be
ye!&rsquo;
Then spake Red-wolf, and said: &lsquo;Ye Sons of the Wolf, who
parted from us of old time in that cleft of the mountains, it is
our very selves that we give unto you; and these are a part of
ourselves; how then should we leave them behind us?&nbsp; Bear
witness, O men of Burgdale and the Sheepcotes, that we have
become one Folk with the men of Shadowy Vale, never to be
sundered again!&rsquo;
p. 304Then
all that multitude shouted with a loud voice; and when the shout
had died away, Folk-might spake again:
&lsquo;O Warriors of the Sundering, here shall your wives and
children abide, while we go a little journey to rejoice our
hearts with the hard handplay, and take to us that which we have
missed: and to-morrow morn is appointed for this same journey,
unless ye be over foot-weary with the ways of the
Waste.&rsquo;
Red-wolf smiled as he answered: &lsquo;This ye say in jest,
brother; for ye may see that our day&rsquo;s journey hath not
been over-much for our old men; how then should it weary those
who may yet bear sword?&nbsp; We are ready for the road and eager
for the handplay.&rsquo;
&lsquo;This is well,&rsquo; said Folk-might, &lsquo;and what
was to be looked for.&nbsp; Therefore, brother, do ye and your
counsel-mates come straightway to the Hall of the Wolf; wherein,
after ye have eaten and drunken, shall we take counsel with our
brethren of Burgdale and the Sheepcotes, so that all may be
ordered for battle!&rsquo;
Said Red-wolf: &lsquo;Good is that, if we must needs abide
till to-morrow; for verily we came not hither to eat and drink
and rest our bodies; but it must be as ye will have
it.&rsquo;
Then the Sun-beam left the hand of Face-of-god and came
forward, and held out both her palms to the Woodland-folk, and
spake in a voice that was heard afar, though it were a
woman&rsquo;s, so clear and sweet it was; and she said:
&lsquo;O Warriors of the Sundering, ye who be not needed in
the Hall, and ye our sisters with your little ones and your
fathers, come now to us and down to the tents which we have
arrayed for you, and there think for a little that we are all at
our very home that we long for and have yet to win, and be ye
merry with us and make us merry.&rsquo;
Therewith she stepped forward daintily and entered into their
throng, and took an old man of the Woodlanders by the hand, and
kissed his cheek and led him away, and the coming rest seemed
sweet to him.&nbsp; And then came other women of the Vale, kind
and p. 305fair
and smiling, and led away, some an old mother of the
Wood-landers, some a young wife, some a pair of lads; and not a
few forsooth kissed and embraced the stark warriors, and went
away with them toward the tents, which stood along the side of
the Shivering Flood where it was at its quietest; for there was
the grass the softest and most abundant.&nbsp; There on the green
grass were tables arrayed, and lamps were hung above them on
spears, to be litten when the daylight should fail.&nbsp; And the
best of the victual which the Vale could give was spread on the
boards, along with wine and dainties, bought in Silver-dale, or
on the edges of the Westland with sword-strokes and
arrow-flight.
There then they feasted and were merry; and the Sun-beam and
Bow-may and the other women of the Vale served them at table, and
were very blithe with them, caressing them with soft words, and
with clipping and kissing, as folk who were grown exceeding dear
to them; so that that eve of battle was softer and sweeter to
them than any hour of their life.&nbsp; With these feasters were
God-swain and Spear-fist of the delivered thralls of Silver-dale
as glad as glad might be; but Wolf-stone their eldest was gone
with Dallach to the Council in the Hall.
The men of Burgdale and the Shepherds feasted otherwhere in
all content, nor lacked folk of the Vale to serve them.&nbsp;
Amongst the men of the Face were the ten delivered thralls who
had heart to meet their masters in arms: seven of them were of
Rose-dale and three of Silver-dale.
The Bride was with her kindred of the Steer, with whom were
many men of Shadowy Vale, and she served her friends and fellows
clad in her war-gear, save helm and hauberk, bearing herself as
one who is serving dear guests.&nbsp; And men equalled her for
her beauty to the Gods of the High Place and the Choosers of the
Slain; and they who had not beheld her before marvelled at her,
and her loveliness held all men&rsquo;s hearts in a net of
desire, so that they forebore their meat to gaze upon her; and if
perchance her hand touched some young man, or her cheek or
sweet-breathed p.
306mouth came nigh to his face, he became bewildered and
wist not where he was, nor what to do.&nbsp; Yet was she as lowly
and simple of speech and demeanour as if she were a gooseherd of
fourteen winters.
In the Hall was a goodly company, and all the leaders of the
Folk were therein, and Folk-might and the War-leader sitting in
the midst of those stone seats on the days.&nbsp; There then they
agreed on the whole ordering of the battle and the wending of the
host, as shall be told later on; and this matter was long
a-doing, and when it was done, men went to their places to sleep,
for the night was well worn.
But when men had departed and all was still, Folk-might,
light-clad and without a weapon, left the Hall and walked briskly
toward the nether end of the Vale.&nbsp; He passed by all the
tents, the last whereof were of the House of the Steer, and came
to a place where was a great rock rising straight up from the
plain like sheaves of black staves standing close together; and
it was called Staff-stone, and tales of the elves had been told
concerning it, so that Stone-face had beheld it gladly the day
before.
The moon was just shining into Shadowy Vale, and the grass was
bright wheresoever the shadows of the high cliffs were not, and
the face of Staff-stone shone bright grey as Folk-might came
within sight of it, and he beheld someone sitting at the base of
the rock, and as he drew nigher he saw that it was a woman, and
knew her for the Bride; for he had prayed her to abide him there
that night, because it was nigh to the tents of the House of the
Steer; and his heart was glad as he drew nigh to her.
She sat quietly on a fragment of the black rock, clad as she
had been all day, in her glittering kirtle, but without hauberk
or helm, a wreath of wind-flowers about her head, her feet
crossed over each other, her hands laid palm uppermost in her
lap.&nbsp; She moved not as he drew nigh, but said in a gentle
voice when he was close to her:
&lsquo;Chief of the Wolf, great warrior, thou wouldest speak
with p. 307me;
and good it is that friends should talk together on the eve of
battle, when they may never meet alive again.&rsquo;
He said: &lsquo;My talk shall not be long; for thou and I both
must sleep to-night, since there is work to hand to-morrow.&nbsp;
Now since, as thou sayest, O fairest of women, we may never meet
again alive, I ask thee now at this hour, when we both live and
are near to one another, to suffer me to speak to thee of my love
of thee and desire for thee.&nbsp; Surely thou, who art the
sweetest of all things the Gods and the kindreds have made, wilt
not gainsay me this?&rsquo;
She said very sweetly, yet smiling: &lsquo;Brother of my
father&rsquo;s sons, how can I gainsay thee thy speech?&nbsp;
Nay, hast thou not said it?&nbsp; What more canst thou add to it
that will have fresh meaning to mine ears?&rsquo;
He said: &lsquo;Thou sayest sooth: might I then but kiss thine
hand?&rsquo;
She said, no longer smiling: &lsquo;Yea surely, even so may
all men do who can be called my friends&mdash;and thou art much
my friend.&rsquo;
He took her hand and kissed it, and held it thereafter; nor
did she draw it away.&nbsp; The moon shone brightly on them; but
by its light he could not see if she reddened, but he deemed that
her face was troubled.&nbsp; Then he said: &lsquo;It were better
for me if I might kiss thy face, and take thee in mine
arms.&rsquo;
Then said she: &lsquo;This only shall a man do with me when I
long to do the like with him.&nbsp; And since thou art so much my
friend, I will tell thee that as for this longing, I have it
not.&nbsp; Bethink thee what a little while it is since the lack
of another man&rsquo;s love grieved me sorely.&rsquo;
&lsquo;The time is short,&rsquo; said Folk-might, &lsquo;if we
tell up the hours thereof; but in that short space have a many
things betid.&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;Dost thou know, canst thou guess, how sorely
ashamed I went amongst my people?&nbsp; I durst look no man in
the face for the aching of mine heart, which methought all might
see through my face.&rsquo;
p.
308&lsquo;I knew it well,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;yet of me
wert thou not ashamed but a little while ago, when thou didst
tell me of thy grief.&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;True it is; and thou wert kind to me.&nbsp;
Thou didst become a dear friend to me, methought.&rsquo;
&lsquo;And wilt thou hurt a dear friend?&rsquo; said he.
&lsquo;O no,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;if I might do
otherwise.&nbsp; Yet how if I might not choose?&nbsp; Shall there
be no forgiveness for me then?&rsquo;
He answered nothing; and still he held her hand that strove
not to be gone from his, and she cast down her eyes.&nbsp; Then
he spake in a while:
&lsquo;My friend, I have been thinking of thee and of me; and
now hearken: if thou wilt declare that thou feelest no sweetness
embracing thine heart when I say that I desire thee sorely, as
now I say it; or when I kiss thine hand, as now I kiss it; or
when I pray thee to suffer me to cast mine arms about thee and
kiss thy face, as now I pray it: if thou wilt say this, then will
I take thee by the hand straightway, and lead thee to the tents
of the House of the Steer, and say farewell to thee till the
battle is over.&nbsp; Canst thou say this out of the truth of
thine heart?&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;What then if I cannot say this word?&nbsp;
What then?&rsquo;
But he answered nothing; and she sat still a little while, and
then arose and stood before him, looking him in the eyes, and
said:
&lsquo;I cannot say it.&rsquo;
Then he caught her in his arms and strained her to him, and
then kissed her lips and her face again and again, and she strove
not with him.&nbsp; But at last she said:
&lsquo;Yet after all this shalt thou lead me back to my folk
straight-way; and when the battle is done, if both we are living,
then shall we speak more thereof.&rsquo;
So he took her hand and led her on toward the tents of the
Steer, and for a while he spake nought; for he doubted himself,
what he should say; but at last he spake:
&lsquo;Now is this better for me than if it had not been,
whether I p.
309live or whether I die.&nbsp; Yet thou hast not said
that thou lovest me and desirest me.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Wilt thou compel me?&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;To-night I may not say it.&nbsp; Who shall say what words
my lips shall fashion when we stand together victorious in
Silver-dale; then indeed may the time seem long from
now.&rsquo;
He said: &lsquo;Yea, true is that; yet once again I say that
so measured long and long is the time since first I saw thee in
Burgdale before thou knewest me.&nbsp; Yet now I will not bicker
with thee, for be sure that I am glad at heart.&nbsp; And lo you!
our feet have brought us to the tents of thy people.&nbsp; All
good go with thee!&rsquo;
&lsquo;And with thee, sweet friend,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
Then she lingered a little, turning her head toward the tents,
and then turned her face toward him and laid her hand on his
neck, and drew his head adown to her and kissed his cheek, and
therewith swiftly and lightly departed from him.
Now the night wore and the morning came; and Face-of-god was
abroad very early in the morning, as his custom was; and he
washed the night from off him in the Carles&rsquo; Bath of the
Shivering Flood, and then went round through the encampment of
the host, and saw none stirring save here and there the last
watchmen of the night.&nbsp; He spake with one or two of these,
and then went up to the head of the Vale, where was the pass that
led to Silver-dale; and there he saw the watch, and spake with
them, and they told him that none had as yet come forth from the
pass, and he bade them to blow the horn of warning to rouse up
the Host as soon as the messengers came thence.&nbsp; For
forerunners had been sent up the pass, and had been set to hold
watch at divers places therein to pass on the word from place to
place.
Thence went Face-of-god back toward the Hall; but when he was
yet some way from it, he saw a slender glittering warrior come
forth from the door thereof, who stood for a moment looking round
about, and then came lightly and swiftly toward him; and lo! it
was the Sun-beam, with a long hauberk over her kirtle  a
name="page310">p. 310falling
below her knees, a helm on her head and plated shoes on her
feet.&nbsp; She came up to him, and laid her hand to his cheek
and the golden locks of his head (for he was bare-headed), and
said to him, smiling:
&lsquo;Gold-mane! thou badest me bear arms, and Folk-might
also constrained me thereto.&nbsp; Lo thou!&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;Folk-might is wise then, even as I
am; and forsooth as thou art.&nbsp; For bethink thee if the bow
drawn at a venture should speed the eyeless shaft against thy
breast, and send me forth a wanderer from my Folk!&nbsp; For how
could I bear the sight of the fair Dale, and no hope to see thee
again therein?&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;The heart is light within me to-day.&nbsp;
Deemest thou that this is strange?&nbsp; Or dost thou call to
mind that which thou spakest the other day, that it was of no
avail to stand in the Doom-ring of the Folk and bear witness
against ourselves?&nbsp; This will I not.&nbsp; This is no
light-mindedness that thou beholdest in me, but the valiancy that
the Fathers have set in mine heart.&nbsp; Deem not, O Gold-mane,
fear not, that we shall die before they dight the bride-bed for
us.&rsquo;
He would have kissed her mouth, but she put him away with her
hand, and doffed her helm and laid it on the grass, and said:
&lsquo;This is not the last time that thou shalt kiss me,
Gold-mane, my dear; and yet I long for it as if it were, so high
as the Fathers have raised me up this morn above fear and
sadness.&rsquo;
He said nought, but drew her to him, and wonder so moved him,
that he looked long and closely at her face before he kissed her;
and forsooth he could find no blemish in it: it was as if it were
but new come from the smithy of the Gods, and exceeding longing
took hold of him.&nbsp; But even as their lips met, from the head
of the Vale came the voice of the great horn; and it was answered
straightway by the watchers all down the tents; and presently
arose the shouts of men and the clash of weapons as folk armed
themselves, and laughter therewith, for most men were
battle-merry, and the cries of women shrilly-clear as they  a
name="page311">p. 311hastened
about, busy over the morning meal before the departure of the
Host.&nbsp; But Face-of-god said softly, still caressing the
Sun-beam, and she him:
&lsquo;Thus then we depart from this Valley of the Shadows,
but as thou saidst when first we met therein, there shall be no
sundering of thee and me, but thou shalt go down with me to the
battle.&rsquo;
And he led her by the hand into the Hall of the Wolf, and
there they ate a morsel, and thereafter Face-of-god tarried not,
but busied himself along with Folk-might and the other chieftains
in arraying the Host for departure.
CHAPTER XLI.&nbsp; THE HOST DEPARTETH FROM SHADOWY VALE: THE
FIRST DAY&rsquo;S JOURNEY.
It was about three hours before
noon that the Host began to enter into the pass out of Shadowy
Vale by the river-side; and the women and children, and men
unfightworthy, stood on the higher ground at the foot of the
cliffs to see the Host wend on the way.&nbsp; Of these a many
were of the Woodlanders, who were now one folk with them of
Shadowy Vale.&nbsp; And all these had chosen to abide tidings in
the Vale, deeming that there was little danger therein, since
that last slaughter which Folk-might had made of the Dusky Men;
albeit Face-of-god had offered to send them all to Burgstead with
two score and ten men-at-arms to guard them by the way and to eke
out the warders of the Burg.
Now the fighting-men of Shadowy Vale were two long hundreds
lacking five; of whom two score and ten were women, and three
score and ten lads under twenty winters; but the women, though
you might scarce see fairer of face and body, were doughty in
arms, all good shooters in the bow; and the swains were eager and
light-foot, cragsmen of the best, wont to scaling the cliffs of
the Vale in search of the nests of gerfalcons  a
name="page312">p. 312and
such-like fowl, and swimming the strong streams of the Shivering
Flood; tough bodies and wiry, stronger than most grown men, and
as fearless as the best.
The order of the Departure of the Host was this:
The Woodlanders went first into the pass, and with them were
two score of the ripe Warriors of the Wolf.&nbsp; Then came of
the kindreds of Burgdale, the Men of the Steer, the Bridge, and
the Bull; then the Men of the Vine and the Sickle; then the
Shepherd-folk; and lastly, the Men of the Face led by Stone-face
and Hall-face.&nbsp; With these went another two score of the
dwellers in Shadowy Vale, and the rest were scattered up and down
the bands of the Host to guide them into the best paths and to
make the way easier to them.&nbsp; Face-of-god was sundered from
his kindred, and went along with Folk-might in the forefront of
the Host, while his father the Alderman went as a simple
man-at-arms with his House in the rearward.&nbsp; The Sun-beam
followed her brother and Face-of-god amidst the Warriors of the
Wolf, and with her were Bow-may clad in the Alderman&rsquo;s
gift, and Wood-father and his children.&nbsp; Bow-may had caused
her to doff her hauberk for that day, whereon they looked to fall
in with no foeman.&nbsp; As for the Bride, she went with her
kindred in all her war-gear; and the morning sun shone in the
gems of her apparel, and her jewelled feet fell like flowers upon
the deep grass of the upper Vale, and shone strange and bright
amongst the black stones of the pass.&nbsp; She bore a quiver at
her back and a shining yew bow in her hand, and went amongst the
bowmen, for she was a very deft archer.
So fared they into the pass, leaving peace behind them, with
all their banners displayed, and the banner of the Red-mouthed
Wolf went with the Wolf and the Sun-burst in the forefront of
their battle next after the two captains.
As for their road, the grassy space between the rock-wall and
the water was wide and smooth at first, and the cliffs rose up
like bundles of spear-shafts high and clear from the green grass
p. 313with no
confused litter of fallen stones; so that the men strode on
briskly, their hearts high-raised and full of hope.&nbsp; And as
they went, the sweetness of song stirred in their souls, and at
last Bow-may fell to singing in a loud clear voice, and her
cousin Wood-wise answered her, and all the warriors of the Wolf
who were in their band fell into the song at the ending, and the
sound of their melody went down the water and reached the ears of
those that were entering the pass, and of those who were abiding
till the way should be clear of them: and this is some of what
they sang:
Bow-may singeth:
Hear ye never a voice come crying
&nbsp;&nbsp; Out from the waste where the winds fare wide?
&lsquo;Sons of the Wolf, the days are dying,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And where in the clefts of the rocks do ye hide?
&lsquo;Into your hands hath the Sword been
given,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hard are the palms with the kiss of the hilt;
Through the trackless waste hath the road been riven
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the blade to seek to the heart of the guilt.
&lsquo;And yet ye bide and yet ye tarry;
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dear deem ye the sleep &rsquo;twixt hearth and
board,
And sweet the maiden mouths ye marry,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bright the blade of the bloodless
sword.&rsquo;
Wood-wise singeth:
Yea, here we dwell in the arms of our Mother br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Shadowy Queen, and the hope of the Waste;
Here first we came, when never another
&nbsp;&nbsp; Adown the rocky stair made haste.

Far is the foe, and no sword beholdeth
&nbsp;&nbsp; What deed we work and whither we wend;
p. 314Dear are
the days, and the Year enfoldeth
&nbsp;&nbsp; The love of our life from end to end.

Voice of our Fathers, why will ye move us,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And call up the sun our swords to behold?
Why will ye cry on the foeman to prove us?
&nbsp;&nbsp; Why will ye stir up the heart of the bold?
Bow-may singeth:
Purblind am I, the voice of the chiding;
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then tell me what is the thing ye bear?
What is the gift that your hands are hiding,
&nbsp;&nbsp; The gold-adorned, the dread and dear?
Wood-wise singeth:
Dark in the sheath lies the Anvil&rsquo;s
Brother,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hid is the hammered Death of Men.
Would ye look on the gift of the green-clad Mother?
&nbsp;&nbsp; How then shall ye ask for a gift again?
The Warriors sing:
Show we the Sunlight the Gift of the Mother, br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; As foot follows foot to the foeman&rsquo;s den! br
/>
Gleam Sun, breathe Wind, on the Anvil&rsquo;s Brother,
&nbsp;&nbsp; For bare is the hammered Death of Men.
Therewith they shook their naked swords in the air, and fared
on eagerly, and as swiftly as the pass would have them
fare.&nbsp; But so it was, that when the rearward of the Host was
entering the first of the pass, and was going on the wide smooth
sward, the vanward was gotten to where there was but a narrow
space clear betwixt water and cliff; for otherwhere was a litter
of great rocks and small, hard to be threaded even by those who
knew the passes well; so that men had to tread along the very
verge of the Shivering Flood, and wary must they be, for the
water ran swift p.
315and deep betwixt banks of sheer rock half a fathom
below their very foot-soles, which had but bare space to go on
the narrow a way.&nbsp; So it held on for a while, and then got
safer, and there was more space for going betwixt cliff and
flood; albeit it was toilsome enough, since for some way yet
there was a drift of stones to cumber their feet, some big and
some little, and some very big.&nbsp; After a while the way grew
better, though here and there, where the cliffs lowered, were
wide screes of loose stones that they must needs climb up and
down.&nbsp; Thereafter for a space was there an end of the stony
cumber, but the way betwixt the river and the cliffs narrowed
again, and the black crags grew higher, and at last so exceeding
high, and the way so narrow, that the sky overhead was to them as
though they were at the bottom of a well, and men deemed that
thence they could see the stars at noontide.&nbsp; For some time
withal had the way been mounting up and up, though the cliffs
grew higher over it; till at last they were but going on a narrow
shelf, the Shivering Flood swirling and rattling far below them
betwixt sheer rock-walls grown exceeding high; and above them the
cliffs going up towards the heavens as black as a moonless
starless night of winter.&nbsp; And as the flood thundered below,
so above them roared the ceaseless thunder of the wind of the
pass, that blew exceeding fierce down that strait place; so that
the skirts of their garments were wrapped about their knees by
it, and their feet were well-nigh stayed at whiles as they
breasted the push thereof.
But as they mounted higher and higher yet, the noise of the
waters swelled into a huge roar that drowned the bellowing of the
prisoned wind, and down the pass came drifting a fine rain that
fell not from the sky, for between the clouds of that drift could
folk see the heavens bright and blue above them.&nbsp; This rain
was but the spray of the great force up to whose steps they were
climbing.
Now the way got rougher as they mounted; but this toil was
caused by their gain; for the rock-wall, which thrust out a
buttress p.
316there as if it would have gone to the very edge of the
gap where-through the flood ran, and so have cut the way off
utterly, was here somewhat broken down, and its stones scattered
down the steep bent, so that there was a passage, though a
toilsome one.
Thus then through the wind-borne drift of the great force,
through which men could see the white waters tossing down below,
amidst the clattering thunder of the Shivering Flood and the
rumble of the wind of the gap, that tore through their garments
and hair as if it would rend all to rags and bear it away, the
banners of the Wolf won their way to the crest of the midmost
height of the pass, and the long line of the Host came clambering
after them; and each band of warriors as it reached the top cast
an unheard shout from amidst the tangled fury of wind and
waters.
A little further on and all that turmoil was behind them; the
sun, now grown low, smote the wavering column of spray from the
force at their backs, till the rainbows lay bright across it; and
the sunshine lay wide over a little valley that sloped somewhat
steeply to the west right up from the edge of the river; and
beyond these western slopes could men see a low peak spreading
down on all sides to the plain, till it was like to a bossed
shield, and the name of it was Shield-broad.&nbsp; Dark grey was
the valley everywhere, save that by the side of the water was a
space of bright green-sward hedged about toward the mountain by a
wall of rocks tossed up into wild shapes of spires and jagged
points.&nbsp; The river itself was spread out wide and shallow,
and went rattling about great grey rocks scattered here and there
amidst it, till it gathered itself together to tumble headlong
over three slant steps into the mighty gap below.
From the height in the pass those grey slopes seemed easy to
traverse; but the warriors of the Wolf knew that it was far
otherwise, for they were but the molten rock-sea that in time
long past had flowed forth from Shield-broad and filled up the
whole valley endlong and overthwart, cooling as it flowed, and
the tumbled p.
317hedge of rock round about the green plain by the river
was where the said rock-sea had been stayed by meeting with soft
ground, and had heaped itself up round about the
green-sward.&nbsp; And that great rock-flood as it cooled split
in divers fashions; and the rain and weather had been busy on it
for ages, so that it was worn into a maze of narrow paths, most
of which, after a little, brought the wayfarer to a dead stop, or
else led him back again to the place whence he had started; so
that only those who knew the passes throughly could thread that
maze without immeasurable labour.
Now when the men of the Host looked from the high place
whereon they stood toward the green plain by the river, they saw
on the top of that rock-wall a red pennon waving on a spear, and
beside it three or four weaponed men gleaming bright in the
evening sun; and they waved their swords to the Host, and made
lightning of the sunbeams, and the men of the Host waved swords
to them in turn.&nbsp; For these were the outguards of the Host;
and the place whereon they were was at whiles dwelt in by those
who would drive the spoil in Silver-dale, and midmost of the
green-sward was a booth builded of rough stones and turf, a
refuge for a score of men in rough weather.
So the men of the vanward gat them down the hill, and made the
best of their way toward the grassy plain through that rocky maze
which had once been as a lake of molten glass; and as short as
the way looked from above, it was two hours or ever they came out
of it on to the smooth turf, and it was moonlight and night ere
the House of the Face had gotten on to the green-sward.
There then the Host abode for that night, and after they had
eaten lay down on the green grass and slept as they might.&nbsp;
Bow-may would have brought the Sun-beam into the booth with some
others of the women, but she would not enter it, because she
deemed that otherwise the Bride would abide without; and the
Bride, when she came up, along with the House of the Steer,
beheld the Sun-beam, that Wood-father&rsquo;s children had made a
lair for her without like a hare&rsquo;s form; and forsooth many
a time had she lain  span
class="pagenum">p. 318under the naked heaven in Shadowy
Vale and the waste about it, even as the Bride had in the meadows
of Burgdale.&nbsp; So when the Bride was bidden thereto, she went
meekly into the booth, and lay there with others of the
damsels-at-arms.
CHAPTER XLII.&nbsp; THE HOST COMETH TO THE EDGES OF
SILVER-DALE.
So wore the night, and when the
dawn was come were the two captains afoot, and they went from
band to band to see that all was ready, and all men were astir
betimes, and by the time that the sun smote the eastern side of
Shield-broad ruddy, they had broken their fast and were dight for
departure.&nbsp; Then the horns blew up beside the banners, and
rejoiced the hearts of men.&nbsp; But by the command of the
captains this was the last time that they should sound till they
blew for onset in Silver-dale, because now would they be drawing
nigher and nigher to the foemen, and they wotted not but that
wandering bands of them might be hard on the lips of the pass,
and might hear the horns&rsquo; voice, and turn to see what was
toward.
Forth then went the banners of the Wolf, and the men of the
vanward fell to threading the rock-maze toward the north, and in
two hours&rsquo; time were clear of the Dale under
Shield-broad.&nbsp; All went in the same order as yesterday; but
on this day the Sun-beam would bear her hauberk, and had a sword
girt to her side, and her heart was high and her speech
merry.
When they left the Dale under Shield-broad the way was easy
and wide for a good way, the river flowing betwixt low banks, and
the pass being more like a string of little valleys than a mere
gap, as it had been on the other side of the Dale.&nbsp; But when
one third of the day was past, the way began to narrow on them
again, and to rise up little by little; and at last the
rock-walls drew close to the river, and when men looked toward
the north they p.
319saw no way, and nought but a wall.&nbsp; For the gap of
the Shivering Flood turned now to the east, and the Flood came
down from the east in many falls, as it were over a fearful
stair, through a gap where there was no path between the cliffs
and the water, nought but the boiling flood and its turmoil; so
that they who knew not the road wondered what they should do.
But Folk-might led the banners to where a great buttress of
the cliffs thrust itself into the way, coming well-nigh down to
the water, just at the corner where the river turned eastward,
and they got them about it as they might, and on the other side
thereof lo! another gap exceeding strait, scarce twenty foot
over, wall-sided, rugged beyond measure, going up steeply from
the great valley: a little water ran through it, mostly filling
up the floor of it from side to side; but it was but
shallow.&nbsp; This was now the battle-road of the Host, and the
vanward entered it at once, turning their backs upon the
Shivering Flood.
Full toilsome and dreary was that strait way; often great
stones hung above their heads, bridging the gap and hiding the
sky from them; nor was there any path for them save the stream
itself; so that whiles were they wading its waters to the knee or
higher, and whiles were they striding from stone to stone amidst
the rattle of the waters, and whiles were they stepping warily
along the ledges of rock above the deeper pools, and in all wise
labouring in overcoming the rugged road amidst the twilight of
the gap.
Thus they toiled till the afternoon was well worn, and so at
last they came to where the rock-wall was somewhat broken down on
the north side, and great rocks had fallen across the gap, and
dammed up the waters, which fell scantily over the dam from stone
to stone into a pool at the bottom of it.&nbsp; Up this breach,
then, below the force they scrambled and struggled, for rough
indeed was the road for them; and so came they up out of the gap
on to the open hill-side, a great shoulder of the heath sloping
down from the north, and littered over with big stones, borne
thither p.
320belike by some ice-river of the earlier days; and one
great rock was in special as great as the hall of a wealthy
goodman, and shapen like to a hall with hipped gables, which same
the men of the Wolf called House-stone.
There then the noise and clatter of the vanward rose up on the
face of the heath, and men were exceeding joyous that they had
come so far without mishap.&nbsp; Therewith came weaponed men out
from under House-stone, and they came toward the men of the
vanward, and they were a half-score of the forerunners of the
Wolf; therefore Folk-might and Face-of-god fell at once into
speech with them, and had their tidings; and when they had heard
them, they saw nought to hinder the host from going on their road
to Silver-dale forthright; and there were still three hours of
daylight before them.&nbsp; So the vanward of the host tarried
not, and the captains left word with the men from under
House-stone that the rest of the Host should fare on after them
speedily, and that they should give this word to each company, as
men came up from out the gap.&nbsp; Then they fared speedily up
the hillside, and in an hour&rsquo;s wearing had come to the
crest thereof, and to where the ground fell steadily toward the
north, and hereabout the scattered stones ceased, and on the
other side of the crest the heath began to be soft and boggy, and
at last so soft, that if they had not been wisely led, they had
been bemired oftentimes.&nbsp; At last they came to where the
flows that trickled through the mires drew together into a
stream, so that men could see it running; and thereon some of the
Woodlanders cried out joyously that the waters were running
north; and then all knew that they were drawing nigh to
Silver-dale.
No man they met on the road, nor did they of Shadowy Vale look
to meet any; because the Dusky Men were not great hunters for the
more part, except it were of men, and especially of women; and,
moreover, these hill-slopes of the mountain-necks led no-whither
and were utterly waste and dreary, and there was nought to be
seen there but snipes and bitterns and whimbrel and plover,  a
name="page321">p. 321and here
and there a hill-fox, or the great erne hanging over the heath on
his way to the mountain.
When sunset came, they were getting clear of the miry ground,
and the stream which they had come across amidst of the mires had
got clearer and greater, and rattled down between wide stony
sides over the heath; and here and there it deepened as it cleft
its way through little knolls that rose out of the face of the
mountain-neck.&nbsp; As the Host climbed one of these and was
come to its topmost (it was low enough not to turn the stream),
Face-of-god looked and beheld dark-blue mountains rising up far
off before him, and higher than these, but away to the east, the
snowy peaks of the World-mountains.&nbsp; Then he called to mind
what he had seen from the Burg of the Runaways, and he took
Folk-might by the arm, and pointed toward those far-off
mountains.
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said Folk-might, &lsquo;so it is,
War-leader.&nbsp; Silver-dale lieth between us and yonder blue
ridges, and it is far nigher to us than to them.&rsquo;
But the Sun-beam came close to those twain, and took
Face-of-god by the hand and said: &lsquo;O Gold-mane, dost thou
see?&rsquo; and he turned about and beheld her, and saw how her
cheeks flamed and her eyes glittered, and he said in a low voice:
&lsquo;To-morrow for mirth or silence, for life or
death.&rsquo;
But the whole vanward as they came up stayed to behold the
sight of the mountains on the other side of Silver-dale, and the
banners of the Folk hung over their heads, moving but little in
the soft air of the evening: so went they on their ways.
The sun sank, and dusk came on them as they followed down the
stream, and night came, and was clear and starlit, though the
moon was not yet risen.&nbsp; Now was the ground firm and the
grass sweet and flowery, and wind-worn bushes were scattered
round about them, as they began to go down into the ghyll that
cleft the wall of Silver-dale, and the night-wind blew in their
faces from the very Dale and place of the Battle to be.&nbsp; The
path down was steep at first, but the ghyll was wide, and the  a
name="page322">p. 322sides of it
no longer straight walls, as in the gaps of their earlier
journey, but broken, sloping back, and (as they might see on the
morrow) partly of big stones and shaly grit, partly grown over
with bushes and rough grass, with here and there a little stream
trickling down their sides.&nbsp; As they went, the ghyll widened
out, till at last they were in a valley going down to the plain,
in places steep, in places flat and smooth, the stream ever
rattling down the midst of it, and they on the west side
thereof.&nbsp; The vale was well grassed, and oak-trees and ash
and holly and hazel grew here and there about it; and at last the
Host had before it a wood which filled the vale from side to
side, not much tangled with undergrowth, and quite clear of it
nigh to the stream-side.&nbsp; Thereinto the vanward entered, but
went no long way ere the leaders called a halt and bade pitch the
banners, for that there should they abide the daylight.&nbsp;
Thus it had been determined at the Council of the Hall of the
Wolf; for Folk-might had said: &lsquo;With an Host as great as
ours, and mostly of men come into a land of which they know
nought at all, an onslaught by night is perilous: yea, and our
foes should be over-much scattered, and we should have to wander
about seeking them.&nbsp; Let us rather abide in the wood of
Wood-dale till the morning, and then display our banners on the
hill-side above Silver-dale, so that they may gather together to
fall upon us: in no case shall they keep us out of the
Dale.&rsquo;
There then they stayed, and as each company came up to the
wood, they were marshalled into their due places, so that they
might set the battle in array on the edge of Silver-dale.
CHAPTER XLIII.&nbsp; FACE-OF-GOD LOOKETH ON SILVER-DALE: THE
BOWMEN&rsquo;S BATTLE.
There then they rested, as folk
wearied with the toilsome journey, when they had set sure watches
round about their campment; and they ate quietly what meat they
had p. 323with
them, and so gat them to sleep in the wood on the eve of
battle.
But not all slept; for the two captains went about amongst the
companies, Folk-might to the east, Face-of-god to the west, to
look to the watches, and to see that all was ordered duly.&nbsp;
Also the Sun-beam slept not, but she lay beside Bow-may at the
foot of an oak-tree; she watched Face-of-god as he went away
amidst the men of the Host, and watched and waked abiding his
returning footsteps.
The night was well worn by then he came back to his place in
the vanward, and on his way back he passed through the folk of
the Steer laid along on the grass, all save those of the watch,
and the light of the moon high aloft was mingled with the light
of the earliest dawn; and as it happed he looked down, and lo!
close to his feet the face of the Bride as she lay beside her
grand-sire, her head pillowed on a bundle of bracken.&nbsp; She
was sleeping soundly like a child who has been playing all day,
and whose sleep has come to him unsought and happily.&nbsp; Her
hands were laid together by her side; her cheek was as fair and
clear as it was wont to be at her best; her face looked calm and
happy, and a lock of her dark-red hair strayed from her uncovered
head over her breast and lay across her wrists, so peacefully she
slept.
Face-of-god turned his eyes from her at once, and went by
swiftly, and came to his own company.&nbsp; The Sun-beam saw him
coming, and rose straightway to her feet from beside Bow-may, who
lay fast asleep, and she held out her hands to him; and he took
them and kissed them, and he cast his arms about her and kissed
her mouth and her face, and she his in likewise; and she
said:
&lsquo;O Gold-mane, if this were but the morrow of
to-morrow!&nbsp; Yet shall all be well; shall it not?&rsquo;
Her voice was low, but it waked Bow-may, who sat up at once
broad awake, after the manner of a hunter of the waste ever ready
for the next thing to betide, and moreover the Sun-beam had been
in her thoughts these two days, and she feared for her,  a
name="page324">p. 324lest she
should be slain or maimed.&nbsp; Now she smiled on the Sun-beam
and said:
&lsquo;What is it?&nbsp; Does thy mind forebode evil?&nbsp;
That needeth not.&nbsp; I tell thee it is not so ill for us of
the sword to be in Silver-dale.&nbsp; Thrice have I been there
since the Overthrow, and never more than a half-score in company,
and yet am I whole to-day.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, sister,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;but in
past times ye did your deed and then fled away; but now we come
to abide here, and this night is the last of lurking.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;a little way from this I
saw such things that we had good will to abide here longer, few
as we were, but that we feared to be taken alive.&rsquo;
&lsquo;What things were these?&rsquo; said Face-of-god.
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I will not tell thee now;
but mayhap in the lighted winter feast-hall, when the kindred are
so nigh us and about us that they seem to us as if they were all
the world, I may tell it thee; or mayhap I never
shall.&rsquo;
Said the Sun-beam, smiling: &lsquo;Thou wilt ever be talking,
Bow-may.&nbsp; Now let the War-leader depart, for he will have
much to do.&rsquo;
And she was well at ease that she had seen Face-of-god again;
but he said:
&lsquo;Nay, not so much; all is well-nigh done; in an hour it
will be broad day, and two hours thereafter shall the Banner be
displayed on the edge of Silver-dale.&rsquo;
The cheek of the Sun-beam flushed, and paled again, as she
said: &lsquo;Yea, we shall stand even as our Fathers stood on the
day when, coming from off the waste, they beheld it, and knew it
would be theirs.&nbsp; Ah me! how have I longed for this
morn.&nbsp; But now&mdash;Tell me, Gold-mane, dost thou deem that
I am afraid?&nbsp; And I whom thou hast deemed to be a
God.&rsquo;
Quoth Bow-may: &lsquo;Thou shalt deem her twice a God ere
noon-tide, brother Gold-mane.&nbsp; But come now! the hour of
deadly battle is at hand, and we may not laugh that away; and
therefore p.
325I bid thee remember, Gold-mane, how thou didst promise
to kiss me once more on the verge of deadly battle.&rsquo;
Therewith she stood up before him, and he tarried not, but
kind and smiling took her face between his two hands and kissed
her lips, and she cast her arms about him and kissed him, and
then sank down on the grass again, and turned from him, and laid
her face amongst the grass and the bracken, and they could see
that she was weeping, and her body was shaken with sobs.&nbsp;
But the Sun-beam knelt down to her, and caressed her with her
hand, and spake kind words to her softly, while Face-of-god went
his ways to meet Folk-might.
Now was the dawn fading into full daylight; and between dawn
and sunrise were all men stirring; for the watch had waked the
hundred-leaders, and they the leaders of scores and half-scores,
and they the whole folk; and they sat quietly in the wood and
made no noise.
In the night the watch of the Sickle had fallen in with a
thrall who had stolen up from the Dale to set gins for hares, and
now in the early morning they brought him to the
War-leader.&nbsp; He was even such a man as those with whom
Face-of-god had fallen in before, neither better nor worse than
most of them: he was sore afraid at first, but by then he was
come to the captains he understood that he had happened upon
friends; but he was dull of comprehension and slow of
speech.&nbsp; Albeit Folk-might gathered from him that the Dusky
Men had some inkling of the onslaught; for he said that they had
been gathering together in the marketplace of Silver-stead, and
would do so again soon.&nbsp; Moreover, the captains deemed from
his speech that those new tribes had come to hand sooner than was
looked for, and were even now in the Dale.&nbsp; Folk-might
smiled as one who is not best pleased when he heard these
tidings; but Face-of-god was glad to hear thereof; for what he
loathed most was that the war should drag out in hunting of
scattered bands of the foe.&nbsp; Herewith came Dallach to them
as they talked (for Face-of-god had sent for him),  a
name="page326">p. 326and he fell
to questioning the man further; by whose answers it seemed that
many men also had come into the Dale from Rose-dale, so that they
of the kindreds were like to have their hands full.&nbsp; Lastly
Dallach drew from the thrall that it was on that very morning
that the great Folk-mote of the Dusky Men should be holden in the
market-place of the Stead, which was right great, and about it
were the biggest of the houses wherein the men of the kindred had
once dwelt.
So when they had made an end of questioning the thrall, and
had given him meat and drink, they asked him if he would take
weapons in his hand and lead them on the ways into the Dale,
bidding him look about the wood and note how great and mighty an
host they were.&nbsp; And the carle yeasaid this, after staring
about him a while, and they gave him spear and shield, and he
went with the vanward as a way-leader.
Again presently came a watch of the Shepherds, and they had
found a man and a woman dead and stark naked hanging to the
boughs of a great oak-tree deep in the wood.&nbsp; This men knew
for some vengeance of the Dusky Men, for it was clear to see that
these poor people had been sorely tormented before they were
slain.&nbsp; Also the same watch had stumbled on the dead body of
an old woman, clad in rags, lying amongst the rank grass about a
little flow; she was exceeding lean and hunger-starved, and in
her hand was a frog which she had half eaten.&nbsp; And Dallach,
when he heard of this, said that it was the wont of the Dusky Men
to slay their thralls when they were past work, or to drive them
into the wilderness to die.
Lastly came a watch from the men of the Face, having with them
two more thralls, lusty young men; these they had come upon in
company of their master, who had brought them up into the wood to
shoot him a buck, and therefore they bare bows and arrows.&nbsp;
The watch had slain the master straightway while the thralls
stood looking on.&nbsp; They were much afraid of the weaponed
men, but answered to the questioning much readier than the first
p. 327man; for
they were household thralls, and better fed and clad than he, who
was but a toiler in the fields.&nbsp; They yeasaid all his tale,
and said moreover that the Folk-mote of the Dusky Men should be
holden in the market-place that forenoon, and that most of the
warriors should be there, both the new-comers and the Rose-dale
lords, and that without doubt they should be under arms.
To these men also they gave a good sword and a helm each, and
bade them be brisk with their bows, and they said yea to marching
with the Host; and indeed they feared nothing so much as being
left behind; for if they fell into the hands of the Dusky Men,
and their master missing, they should first be questioned with
torments, and then slain in the evillest manner.
Now whereas things had thus betid, and that they knew thus
much of their foemen, Face-of-god called all the chieftains
together, and they sat on the green grass and held counsel
amongst them, and to one and all it seemed good that they should
suffer the Dusky Men to gather together before they meddled with
them, and then fall upon them in such order and such time as
should seem good to the captains watching how things went; and
this would be easy, whereas they were all lying in the wood in
the same order as they would stand in battle-array if they were
all drawn up together on the brow of the hill.&nbsp; Albeit
Face-of-god deemed it good, after he had heard all that they who
had been in the Stead could tell him thereof, that the
Shepherd-Folk, who were more than three long hundreds, and they
of the Steer, the Bridge, and the Bull, four hundreds in all,
should take their places eastward of the Woodlanders who had led
the vanward.
Straightway the word was borne to these men, and the shift was
made: so that presently the Woodlanders were amidmost of the
Host, and had with them on their right hands the Men of the
Steer, the Bridge, and the Bull, and beyond them the
Shepherd-Folk.&nbsp; But on their left hand lay the Men of the
Vine, then they of the Sickle, and lastly the Men of the Face,
and these three kindreds were over five hundreds of warriors: as
for the Men p.
328of the Wolf, they abode at first with those companies
which they had led through the wastes, though this was changed
afterwards.
All this being done, Face-of-god gave out that all men should
break their fast in peace and leisure; and while men were at
their meat, Folk-might spake to Face-of-god and said:
&lsquo;Come, brother, for I would show thee a goodly thing; and
thou, Dallach, come with us.&rsquo;
Then he brought them by paths in the wood till Face-of-god saw
the sky shine white between the tree-boles, and in a little while
they were come well-nigh out of the thicket, and then they went
warily; for before them was nought but the slopes of Wood-dale,
going down steeply into Silver-dale, with nought to hinder the
sight of it, save here and there bushes or scattered trees; and
so fair and lovely it was that Face-of-god could scarce forbear
to cry out.&nbsp; He saw that it was only at the upper or eastern
end, where the mountains of the Waste went round about it, that
the Dale was narrow; it soon widened out toward the west, and for
the most part was encompassed by no such straight-sided a wall as
was Burgdale, but by sloping hills and bents, mostly indeed
somewhat higher and steeper than the pass wherein they were, but
such as men could well climb if they had a mind to, and there
were any end to their journey.&nbsp; The Dale went due west a
good way, and then winded about to the southwest, and so was
hidden from them thereaway by the bents that lay on their left
hand.&nbsp; As it was wider, so it was not so plain a ground as
was Burgdale, but rose in knolls and little hills here and
there.&nbsp; A river greater than the Weltering Water wound about
amongst the said mounds; and along the side of it out in the open
dale were many goodly houses and homesteads of stone.&nbsp; The
knolls were mostly covered over with vines, and there were goodly
and great trees in groves and clumps, chiefly oak and sweet
chestnut and linden; many were the orchards, now in blossom,
about the homesteads; the pastures of the neat and horses spread
out bright green up from the water-side, and deeper  a
name="page329">p. 329green
showed the acres of the wheat on the lower slopes of the knolls,
and in wide fields away from the river.
Just below the pitch of the hill whereon they were, lay
Silver-stead, the town of the Dale.&nbsp; Hitherto it had been an
unfenced place; but Folk-might pointed to where on the western
side a new white wall was rising, and on which, young as the day
yet was, men were busy laying the stones and spreading the
mortar.&nbsp; Fair seemed that town to Face-of-god: the houses
were all builded of stone, and some of the biggest were roofed
with lead, which also as well as silver was dug out of the
mountains at the eastern end of the Dale.&nbsp; The market-place
was clear to see from where they stood, though there were houses
on all sides of it, so wide it was.&nbsp; From their
standing-place it was but three furlongs to this heart of
Silver-dale; and Face-of-god could see brightly-clad men moving
about in it already.&nbsp; High above their heads he beheld two
great clots of scarlet and yellow raised on poles and pitched in
front of a great stone-built hall roofed with lead, which stood
amidmost of the west end of the Place, and betwixt those poles he
saw on a mound with long slopes at its sides somewhat of white
stone, and amidmost of the whole Place a great stack of
faggot-wood built up four-square.&nbsp; Those red and yellow
things on the poles he deemed would be the banners of the
murder-carles; and Folk-might told him that even so it was, and
that they were but big bunches of strips of woollen cloth, much
like to great ragmops, save that the rags were larger and longer:
no other token of war, said Folk-might, did those folk carry,
save a crookbladed sword, smeared with man&rsquo;s blood, and
bigger than any man might wield in battle.
&lsquo;Art thou far-seeing, War-leader?&rsquo; quoth he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What canst thou see in the market-place?&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;Far-seeing am I above most men, and I
see in the Place a man in scarlet standing by the banner, which
is pitched in front of the great stone hall, near to the mound
with the white stone on it; and meseemeth he beareth a great horn
in his hand.&rsquo;
p. 330Said
Folk-might: &lsquo;Yea, and that stone hall was our Mote-house
when we were lords of the Dale, and thence it was that they who
are now thralls of the Dusky Men sent to them their message and
token of yielding.&nbsp; And as for that white stone, it is the
altar of their god; for they have but one, and he is that same
crook-bladed sword.&nbsp; And now that I look, I see a great
stack of wood amidmost the market-place, and well I know what
that betokeneth.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Lo you!&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;the man with
the horn is gone up on to the altar-mound, and meseemeth he is
setting the little end of the horn to his mouth.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Hearken then!&rsquo; said Folk-might.&nbsp; And in a
moment came the hoarse tuneless sound of the horn down the wind
towards them; and Folk-might said:
&lsquo;I deem I should know what that blast meaneth; and now
is it time that the Host drew nigher to set them in array behind
these very trees.&nbsp; But if ye will, War-leader, we will abide
here and watch the ways of the foemen, and send Dallach with the
word to the Host; also I would have thee suffer me to bid hither
at once two score and ten of the best of the bowmen of our folk
and the Woodlanders, and Wood-wise to lead them, for he knoweth
well the land hereabout, and what is good to do.&rsquo;
&lsquo;It is good,&rsquo; said Face-of-god.&nbsp; &lsquo;Be
speedy, Dallach!&rsquo;
So Dallach departed, running lightly, and the two chiefs abode
there; and the horn in Silver-stead blew at whiles for a little,
and then stayed; and Folk-might said:
&lsquo;Lo you! they come flockmeal to the Mote-stead; the
Place will be filled ere long.&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;Will they make offerings to their god
at the hallowing in of their Folk-mote?&nbsp; Where then are the
slaughter-beasts?&rsquo;
&lsquo;They shall not long be lacking,&rsquo; said
Folk-might.&nbsp; &lsquo;See you it is getting thronged about the
altar and the Mote-house.&rsquo;
Now there were four ways into the Market-place of Silver-stead
p. 331turned
toward the four a&iacute;rts, and the midmost of the
kindreds&rsquo; battle looked right down the southern one, which
went up to the wood, but stopped there in a mere woodland path,
and the more part of the town lay north and west of this way,
albeit there was a way from the east also.&nbsp; But the
hill-side just below the two captains lay two furlongs west of
this southern way; and it went down softly till it was gotten
quite near to the backs of the houses on the south side of the
Market-place, and was sprinkled scantly with bushes and trees as
aforesaid; but at last were there more bushes, which well-nigh
made a hedge across it, reaching from the side of the southern
way; and a foot or two beyond these bushes the ground fell by a
steep and broken bent down to the level of the Market-place, and
betwixt that fringe of bushes and the backs of the houses on the
south side of the Place was less it maybe than a full furlong:
but the southern road aforesaid went down softly into the
Market-place, since it had been fashioned so by men.
Now the two chiefs heard a loud blast of horns come up from
the town, and lo! a great crowd of men wending their ways down
the road from the north, and they came into the market-place with
spears and other weapons tossing in the air, and amidst of these
men, who seemed to be all of the warriors, they saw as they drew
nigher some two score and ten of men clad in long raiment of
yellow and scarlet, with tall spiring hats of strange fashion on
their heads, and in their hands long staves with great blades
like scythes done on to them; and again, in the midst of these
yellow and red glaive-bearers, in the very heart of the throng
were some score of naked folk, they deemed both men and women,
but were not sure, so close was the throng; nor could they see if
they were utterly naked.
&lsquo;Lo you, brother!&rsquo; quoth Folk-might, &lsquo;said I
not that the beasts for the hewing should not tarry?&nbsp; Yonder
naked folk are even they: and ye may well deem that they are the
thralls of the Dusky Men; and meseemeth by the whiteness of their
skins they be of p.
332the best of them.&nbsp; For these felons, it is like,
look to winning great plenty of thralls in Burgdale, and so set
the less store on them they have, and may expend them
freely.&rsquo;
As he spake they heard the sound of men marching in the wood
behind them, and they turned about and saw that there was come
Wood-wise, and with him upwards of two score and ten of the
bowmen of the Woodlanders and the Wolf&mdash;huntsmen, cragsmen,
and scourers of the Waste; men who could shoot the chaffinch on
the twig a hundred yards aloof; who could make a hiding-place of
the bennets of the wayside grass, or the stem of the slender
birch-tree.&nbsp; With these must needs be Bow-may, who was the
closest shooter of all the kindreds.
So then Wood-wise told the War-leader that Dallach had given
the word to the Host, and that all men were astir and would be
there presently in their ordered companies; and Face-of-god spake
to Folk-might, and said: &lsquo;Chief of the Wolf, wilt thou not
give command to these bowmen, and set them to the work; for thou
wottest thereof.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, that will I,&rsquo; said Folk-might, and turned to
Wood-wise, and said: &lsquo;Wood-wise, get ye down the slope, and
loose on these felons, who have a murder on hand, if so be ye
have a chance to do it wisely.&nbsp; But in any case come ye all
back; for all shall be needed yet to-day.&nbsp; So flee if they
pursue, for ye shall have us to flee to.&nbsp; Now be ye wary,
nor let the curse of the Wolf and the Face lie on your
slothfulness.&rsquo;
Wood-wise did but nod his head and lift his hand to his
fellows, who set off after him down the slope without more
tarrying.&nbsp; They went very warily, as if they were hunting a
quarry which would flee from them; and they crept amongst the
grass and stones from bush to bush like serpents, and so, unseen
by the Dusky Men, who indeed were busied over their own matters,
they came to the fringe of bushes above the broken ground
aforesaid, and there they took their stand, and before them below
those steep banks was but the space at the back of the
houses.&nbsp; As to the houses, as aforesaid,  a
name="page333">p. 333they were
not so high as elsewhere about the Market-place; and at the end
of a long low hall there was a gap between its gable and the next
house, whereby they had a clear sight of the Place about the
god&rsquo;s altar and the banners, and the great hall of
Silver-dale, with the double stair that went up to the door
thereof.
There then they made them ready, and Wood-wise set men to
watch that none should come sidelong on them unawares; their bows
were bent and their quivers open, and they were eager for the
fray.
Thus they beheld the Market-place from their cover, and saw
that those folk who were to be hewn to the god were now standing
facing the altar in a half-ring, and behind them in another
half-ring the glaive-bearers who had brought them thither stood
glaive in hand ready to hew them down when the token should be
given; and these were indeed the priests of the god.
There was clear space round about these poor
slaughter-thralls, so that the bowmen could see them well, and
they told up a score of them, half men, half women, and they were
all stark naked save for wreaths of flowers about their middles
and their necks; and they had shackles of lead about their
wrists; which same lead should be taken out of the fire wherein
they should be burned, and from the shape it should take after it
had passed through the fire would the priests foretell the luck
of the deed to be done.
It was clear to be seen from thence that Folk-might was right
when he said that these slaughter-thralls were of the best of the
house-thralls and bed-mates of the Dusky Men, and that these
felons were open-handed to their god, and would not cheat him, or
withhold from him the best and most delicate of all they had.
Now spake Wood-wise to those about him: &lsquo;It is sure that
Folk-might would have us give these poor thralls a chance, and
that we must loose upon the felons who would hew them down; and
if we are to come back again, we can go no nigher.&nbsp; What
sayest thou, Bow-may?&nbsp; Is it nigh enough?&nbsp; Can aught be
done?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, yea,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;nigh enough it is;
but let Gold-ring p.
334be with me and half a score of the very best, whether
they be of our folk or the Woodlanders, men who cannot miss such
a mark; and when we have loosed, then let all loose, and stay not
till our shot be spent.&nbsp; Haste, now haste! time presseth;
for if the Host showeth on the brow of the hill, these felons
will hew down their slaughter-beasts before they turn on their
foemen.&nbsp; Let the grey-goose wing speed trouble and confusion
amongst them.&rsquo;
But ere she had done her words Wood-wise had got to speaking
quietly with the Woodlanders; and Bears-bane, who was amidst
them, chose out eight of the best of his folk, men who doubted
nothing of hitting whatever they could see in the Market-place;
and they took their stand for shooting, and with them besides
Bow-may were two women and four men of the Wolf, and Gold-ring
withal, a carle of fifty winters, long, lean, and wiry, a fell
shooter if ever anyone were.
So all these notched their shafts and laid them on the yew,
and each had between the two last fingers of the shaft-hand
another shaft ready, and a half score more stuck into the ground
before him.
Now giveth Wood-wise the word to these sixteen as to which of
the felons with the glaives they shall each one aim at; and he
saith withal in a soft voice: &lsquo;Help cometh from the Hill;
soon shall battle be joined in Silver-dale.&rsquo;
Thus stand they watching Bow-may and Gold-ring till they draw
home the notches; and amidst their waiting the glaive-bearing
felons fall a-singing a harsh and ugly hymn to their
crooked-sword god, and the Market-stead is thronged endlong and
overthwart with the tribes of the Dusky Men.
There now standeth Bow-may far-sighted and keen-eyed, her face
as pale as a linen sleeve, an awful smile on her glittering eyes
and close-set lips, and she feeling the twisted string of the red
yew and the polished sides of the notch, while the yelling song
of the Dusky priests quavers now and ends with a wild shrill cry,
and she noteth the midmost of the priests beginning to handle  a
name="page335">p. 335his weapon:
then swift and steady she draweth home the notches, while the yew
bow standeth still as the oak-bole ere the summer storm ariseth,
and the twang of the sixteen strings maketh but one fell sound as
the feathered bane of men goeth on its way.
There was silence for a moment of time in the Market of
Silver-stead, as if the bolt of the Gods had fallen there; and
then arose a huge wordless yell from those about the altar, and
one of the priests who was left hove up his glaive two-handed to
smite the naked slaughter-thralls; but or ever the stroke fell,
Bow-may&rsquo;s second shaft was through his throat, and he
rolled over amidst his dead fellows; and the other fifteen had
loosed with her, and then even as they could Wood-wise and the
others of their company; and all they notched and loosed without
tarrying, and no shout, no word came from their lips, only the
twanging strings spake for them; for they deemed the minutes that
hurried by were worth much joy of their lives to be.&nbsp; And
few indeed were the passing minutes ere the dead men lay in heaps
about the Altar of the Crooked Sword, and the wounded men
wallowed amidst them.
CHAPTER XLIV.&nbsp; OF THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE MEN OF THE STEER,
THE BRIDGE, AND THE BULL.
Wild was the turmoil and confusion
in the Market-stead; for the more part of the men therein knew
not what had befallen about the altar, though some clomb up to
the top of that stack of faggots built for the burning of the
thralls, and when they saw what was toward fell to yelling and
cursing; and their fellows on the plain Place could not hear
their story for the clamour, and they also fell to howling as if
a wood full of wild dogs was there.
And still the shafts rained down on that throng from the Bent
of the Bowmen, for another two score men of the Woodlanders  a
name="page336">p. 336had crept
down the hill to them, and shafts failed them not.&nbsp; But the
Dusky Men about the altar, for all their terror, or even maybe
because of it, now began to turn upon the scarce-seen foemen, and
to press up wildly toward the hill-side, though as it were
without any order or aim.&nbsp; Every man of them had his
weapons, and those no mere gilded toys, but their very tools of
battle; and some, but no great number, had their bows with them
and a few shafts; and these began to shoot at whatsoever they
could see on the hill-side, but at first so wildly and hurriedly
that they did no harm.
It must be said of them that at first only those about the
altar fell on toward the hill; for those about the road that led
southward knew not what had betided nor whither to turn.&nbsp; So
that at this beginning of the battle, of all the thousands in the
great Place it was but a few hundreds that set on the Bent of the
Bowmen, and at these the bowmen of the kindreds shot so close and
so wholly together that they fell one over another in the narrow
ways between the houses whereby they must needs go to gather on
the plain ground betwixt the backs of the houses and the break of
the hill-side.&nbsp; But little by little the archers of the
Dusky Men gathered behind the corpses of the slain, and fell to
shooting at what they could see of the men of the kindreds, which
at that while was not much, for as bold as they were, they fought
like wary hunters of the Wood and the Waste.
But now at last throughout all that throng of Felons in the
Market-place the tale began to spread of foemen come into the
Dale and shooting from the Bents, and all they turned their faces
to the hill, and the whole set of the throng was thitherward;
though they fared but slowly, so evil was the order of them, each
man hindering his neighbour as he went.&nbsp; And not only did
the Dusky Men come flockmeal toward the Bent of the Bowmen, but
also they jostled along toward the road that led southward.&nbsp;
That beheld Wood-wise from the Bent, and he was minded to get him
and his aback, now that they had made so  a
name="page337">p. 337great a
slaughter of the foemen; and two or three of his fellows had been
hurt by arrows, and Bow-may, she would have been slain thrice
over but for the hammer-work of the Alderman.&nbsp; And no marvel
was that; for now she stood on a little mound not half covered by
a thin thorn-bush, and notched and loosed at whatever was most
notable, as though she were shooting at the mark on a summer
evening in Shadowy Vale.&nbsp; But as Wood-wise was at point to
give the word to depart, from behind them rang out the merry
sound of the Burgdale horns, and he turned to look at the
wood-side, and lo! thereunder was the hill bright and dark with
men-at-arms, and over them floated the Banners of the Wolf, and
the Banners of the Steer, the Bridge, and the Bull.&nbsp; Then
gave forth the bowmen of the kindreds their first shout, and they
made no stay in their shooting; but shot the eagerer, for they
deemed that help would come without their turning about to draw
it to them: and even so it was.&nbsp; For straightway down the
bent came striding Face-of-god betwixt the two Banners of the
Wolf, and beside him were Red-wolf the tall and War-grove, and
therewithal Wood-wont and Wood-wicked, and many other men of the
Wolf; for now that the men of the kindreds had been brought face
to face with the foe, and there was less need of them for
way-leaders, the more part of them were liefer to fight under
their own banner along with the Woodlanders; so that the company
of those who went under the Wolves was more than three long
hundreds and a half; and the bowmen on the edge of the bent
shouted again and merrily, when they felt that their brothers
were amongst them, and presently was the arrow-storm at its
fiercest, and the twanging of bow-strings and the whistle of the
shafts was as the wind among the clefts of the mountains; for all
the new-comers were bowmen of the best.
But the kindreds of the Steer, the Bridge, and the Bull, they
hung yet a while longer on the hills&rsquo; brow, their banners
floating over them and their horns blowing; and the Dusky  a
name="page338">p. 338Felons in
the Market-place beheld them, and fear and rage at once filled
their hearts, and a fierce and dreadful yell brake out from them,
and joyously did the Men of Burgdale answer them, and song arose
amongst them even such as this:
The Men of the Bridge
sing:
Why stand ye together, why bear ye the
shield,
Now the calf straineth tether at edge of the field?
Now the lamb bleateth stronger and waters run
clear,
And the day groweth longer and glad is the year?
Now the mead-flowers jostle so thick as they
stand,
And singeth the throstle all over the land?
The Men of the Steer
sing:
No cloud the day darkened, no thunder we
heard,
But the horns&rsquo; speech we hearkened as men unafeared.
Yea, so merry it sounded, we turned from the
Dale,
Where all wealth abounded, to wot of its tale.
The Men of the Bridge
sing:
What white boles then bear ye, what wealth of
the woods?
What chafferers hear ye bid loud for your goods?
The Men of the Bull
sing:
O the bright beams we carry are stems of the
steel;
Nor long shall we tarry across them to deal.
Hark the men of the cheaping, how loudly they
cry
On the hook for the reaping of men doomed to die!
They all sing:
Heave spear up! fare forward, O Men of the
Dale!
For the Warrior, our war-ward, shall hearken the tale.
p.
339Therewith they ceased a moment, and then gave a great
and hearty shout all together, and all their horns blew, and they
moved on down the hill as one man, slowly and with no jostling,
the spear-men first, and then they of the axe and the sword; and
on their flanks the deft archers loosed on the stumbling jostling
throng of the Dusky Men, who for their part came on drifting and
surging up the road to the hill.
But when those big spearmen of the Dale had gone a little way
the horns&rsquo; voice died out, and their great-staved spears
rose up from their shoulders into the air, and stood so a moment,
and then slowly fell forward, as the oars of the longship fall
into the row-locks, and then over the shoulders of the foremost
men showed the steel of the five ranks behind them, and their own
spears cast long bars of shadow on the whiteness of the sunny
road.&nbsp; No sound came from them now save the rattle of their
armour and the tramp of their steady feet; but from the Dusky Men
rose up hideous confused yelling, and those that could free
themselves from the tangle of the throng rushed desperately
against the on-rolling hedge of steel, and the whole throng
shoved on behind them.&nbsp; Then met steel and men; here and
there an ash-stave broke; here and there a Dusky Felon rolled
himself unhurt under the ash-staves, and hewed the knees of the
Dalesmen, and a tall man came tottering down; but what men or
wood-wights could endure the push of spears of those mighty
husbandmen?&nbsp; The Dusky Ones shrunk back yelling, or turned
their backs and rushed at their own folk with such fierce agony
that they entered into the throng, till the terror of the spear
reached to the midmost of it and swayed them back on the
hindermost; for neither was there outgate for the felons on the
flanks of the spearmen, since there the feathered death beset
them, and the bowmen (and the Bride amongst the foremost) shot
wholly together, and no shaft flew idly.&nbsp; But the wise
leaders of the Dalesmen would not that they should thrust in too
far amongst the howling throng of the Dusky Men, lest they should
be hemmed in by them; for they were but a handful in regard to
them: so there they  span
class="pagenum">p. 340stayed, barring the way to the Dusky
Men, and the bowmen still loosed from the flanks of them, or
aimed deftly from betwixt the ranks of the spearmen.
And now was there a space of ten strides or more betwixt the
Dalesmen and their foes, over which the spears hung terribly, nor
durst the Dusky Men adventure there; and thereon was nought but
men dead or sorely hurt.&nbsp; Then suddenly a horn rang thrice
shrilly over all the noise and clamour of the throng, and the
ranks of the spearmen opened, and forth into that space strode
two score of the swordsmen and axe-wielders of the Dale, their
weapons raised in their hands, and he who led them was Iron-hand
of the House of the Bull: tall he was, wide-shouldered, exceeding
strong, but beardless and fair-faced.&nbsp; He bore aloft a
two-edged sword, broad-bladed, exceeding heavy, so that few men
could wield it in battle, but not right long; it was an ancient
weapon, and his father before him had called it the
Barley-scythe.&nbsp; With him were some of the best of the
kindreds, as Wolf of Whitegarth, Long-hand of Oakholt, Hart of
Highcliff, and War-well the captain of the Bridge.&nbsp; These
made no tarrying on that space of the dead, but cried aloud their
cries: &lsquo;For the Burg and the Steer! for the Dale and the
Bridge! for the Dale and the Bull!&rsquo; and so fell at once on
the Felons; who fled not, nor had room to flee; and also they
feared not the edge-weapons so sorely as they feared those huge
spears.&nbsp; So they turned fiercely on the swordsmen, and
chiefly on Iron-hand, as he entered in amongst them the first of
all, hewing to the right hand and the left, and many a man fell
before the Barley-scythe; for they were but little before
him.&nbsp; Yet as one fell another took his place, and hewed at
him with the steel axe and the crooked sword; and with many
strokes they clave his shield and brake his helm and rent his
byrny, while he heeded little save smiting with the
Barley-scythe, and the blood ran from his arm and his shoulder
and his thigh.
But War-well had entered in among the foe on his left hand,
and unshielded hove up a great broad-bladed axe, that clave the
p. 341iron
helms of the Dusky Men, and rent their horn-scaled byrnies.&nbsp;
He was not very tall, but his shoulders were huge and his arms
long, and nought could abide his stroke.&nbsp; He cleared a ring
round Iron-hand, whose eyes were growing dim as the blood flowed
from him, and hewed three strokes before him; then turned and
drew the champion out of the throng, and gave him into the arms
of his fellows to stanch the blood that drained away the might of
his limbs; and then with a great wordless roar leaped back again
on the Dusky Men as the lion leapeth on the herd of swine; and
they shrank away before him; and all the swordsmen shouted,
&lsquo;For the Bridge, for the Bridge!&rsquo; and pressed on the
harder, smiting down all before them.&nbsp; On his left hand now
was Hart of Highcliff wielding a good sword hight Chip-driver,
wherewith he had slain and hurt a many, fighting wisely with
sword and shield, and driving the point home through the joints
of the armour.&nbsp; But even therewith, as he drave a great
stroke at a lord of the Dusky Ones, a cast-spear came flying and
smote him on the breast, so that he staggered, and the stroke
fell flatlings on the shield-boss of his foe, and Chip-driver
brake atwain nigh the hilts; but Hart closed with him, and smote
him on the face with the pommel, and tore his axe from his hand
and clave his skull therewith, and slew him with his own weapon,
and fought on valiantly beside War-well.
Now War-well had fought so fiercely that he had rent his own
hauberk with the might of his strokes, and as he raised his arm
to smite a huge stroke, a deft man of the Felons thrust the spike
of his war-axe up under his arm; and when War-well felt the smart
of the steel, he turned on that man, and, letting his axe fall
down to his wrist and hang there by its loop, he caught the
foeman up by the neck and the breech, and drave him against the
other Dusky Ones before him, so that their weapons pierced and
rent their own friend and fellow.&nbsp; Then he put forth the
might of his arms and the pith of his body, and hove up that
felon and cast him on to the heads of his fellow murder-carles,
so that he rent them and was  span
class="pagenum">p. 342rent by them.&nbsp; Then War-well
fell on again with the axe, and all the champions of the Dale
shouted and fell on with him, and the foe shrank away; and the
Dalesmen cleared a space five fathoms&rsquo; length before them,
and the spearmen drew onward and stood on the space whereon the
first onslaught had been.
Then drew those hewers of the Dale together, and forth from
the company came the man that bare the Banner of the Bridget and
the champions gathered round him, and they ordered their ranks
and strode with the Banner before them three times to and fro
across the road athwart the front of the spearmen, and then with
a great shout drew back within the spear-hedge.&nbsp; Albeit five
of the champions of the Dale had been slain outright there, and
the more part of them hurt more or less.
But when all were well within the ranks, once again blew the
horn, and all the spears sank to the rest, and the kindreds drave
the spear-furrow, and a space was swept clear before them, and
the cries and yells of the Dusky Men were so fierce and wild that
the rough voices of the Dalesmen were drowned amidst them.
Forth then came every bowman of the kindred that was there and
loosed on the Dusky Men; and they forsooth had some bowmen
amongst them, but cooped up and jostled as they were they shot
but wildly; whereas each shaft of the Dale went home truly.
But amongst the bowmen forth came the Bride in her glittering
war-gear, and stepped lightly to the front of the spearmen.&nbsp;
Her own yew bow had been smitten by a shaft and broken in her
hand: so she had caught up a short horn bow and a quiver from one
of the slain of the Dusky Men; and now she knelt on one knee
under the shadow of the spears nigh to her grandsire Hall-ward,
and with a pale face and knitted brow notched and loosed, and
notched and loosed on the throng of foemen, as if she were some
daintily fashioned engine of war.
So fared the battle on the road that went from the south into
the Market-stead.&nbsp; Valiantly had the kindred fought there,
and p. 343no
man of them had blenched, and much had they won; but the way was
perilous before them, for the foe was many and many.
CHAPTER XLV.&nbsp; OF FACE-OF-GOD&rsquo;S ONSLAUGHT.
Now the banners of the Wolf flapped
and rippled over the heads of the Woodlanders and the Men of the
Wolf; and the men shot all they might, nor took heed now to cover
themselves against the shafts of the Dusky Men.&nbsp; As for
these, for all they were so many, their arrow-shot was no great
matter, for they were in very evil order, as has been said; and
moreover, their rage was so great to come to handy strokes with
these foemen, that some of them flung away their bows to brandish
the axe or the sword.&nbsp; Nevertheless were some among the
kindred hurt or slain by their arrows.
Now stood Face-of-god with the foremost; and from where he
stood he could see somewhat of the battle of the Dalesmen, and he
wotted that it was thriving; therefore he looked before him and
close around him, and noted what was toward there.&nbsp; The
space betwixt the houses and the break of the bent was crowded
with the fury of the Dusky Men tossing their weapons aloft,
crying to each other and at the kindred, and here and there
loosing a bow-string on them; but whatever was their rage they
might not come a many together past a line within ten fathom of
the bent&rsquo;s end; for three hundred of the best of bowmen
were shooting at them so ceaselessly that no Dusky man was safe
of any bare place of his body, and they fell over one another in
that penfold of slaughter, and for all their madness did but
little.
Yet was the heart of the War-leader troubled; for he wotted
that it might not last for ever, and there seemed no end to the
throng of murder-carles; and the time would come when the
arrowshot would be spent, and they must needs come to handy
strokes, and that with so many.
p. 344Now a
voice spake to him as he gazed with knitted brows and careful
heart on that turmoil of battle:
&lsquo;What now hast thou done with the Sun-beam, and where is
her brother?&nbsp; Is the Chief of the Wolf skulking when our
work is so heavy?&nbsp; And thou meseemeth art overlate on the
field: the mowing of this meadow is no sluggard&rsquo;s
work.&rsquo;
He turned and beheld Bow-may, and gazed on her face for a
moment, and saw her eyes how they glittered, and how the pommels
of her cheeks were burning red and her lips dry and grey; but
before he answered he looked all round about to see what was to
note; and he touched Bow-may on the shoulder and pointed to down
below where a man of the Felons had just come out of the court of
one of the houses: a man taller than most, very gaily arrayed,
with gilded scales all over him, so that, with his dark face and
blue eyes, he looked like some strange dragon.&nbsp; Bow-may
spake not, but stamped her foot with anger.&nbsp; Yet if her
heart were hot, her hand was steady; for she notched a shaft, and
just as the Dusky Chief raised his axe and brandished it aloft,
she loosed, and the shaft flew and smote the felon in the armpit
and the default of the armour, and he fell to earth.&nbsp; But
even as she loosed, Face-of-god cried out in a loud voice:
&lsquo;O lads of battle! shoot close and all together.&nbsp;
Tarry not, tarry not! for we need a little time ere sword meets
sword, and the others of the kindreds are at work!&rsquo;
But Bow-may turned round to him and said: &lsquo;Wilt thou not
answer me?&nbsp; Where is thy kindness gone?&rsquo;
Even as she was speaking she had notched and loosed another
shaft, speaking as folk do who turn from busy work at loom or
bench.
Then said Face-of-god: &lsquo;Shoot on, sister Bow-may!&nbsp;
The Sun-beam is gone with her brother, and he is with the Men of
the Face.&rsquo;
He broke off here, for a man fell beside him hurt in the neck,
and Face-of-god took his bow from his hands and shot a shaft,  a
name="page345">p. 345while one
of the women who had been hurt also tended the newly-wounded
man.&nbsp; Then Face-of-god went on speaking:
&lsquo;She was unwilling to go, but Folk-might and I
constrained her; for we knew that this is the most perilous place
of the battle&mdash;hah! see those three felons, Bow-may! they
are aiming hither.&rsquo;
And again he loosed and Bow-may also, but a shaft rattled on
his helm withal and another smote a Woodlander beside him, and
pierced through the calf of his leg, as he turned and stooped to
take fresh arrows from a sheaf that lay there; but the carle took
it by the notch and the point, and brake it and drew it out, and
then stood up and went on shooting.&nbsp; And Face-of-god spake
again:
&lsquo;Folk-might skulketh not; nor the Men of the Vine, and
the Sickle, and the Face, nor the Shepherd-Folk: soon shall they
be making our work easy to us, if we can hold our own till
then.&nbsp; They are on the other roads that lead into the
square.&nbsp; Now suffer me, and shoot on!&rsquo;
Therewith he looked round about him, and he saw on the left
hand that all was quiet; and before him was the confused throng
of the Dusky Men trampling their own dead and wounded, and not
able as yet to cross that death-line of the arrow so near to
them.&nbsp; But on his right hand he saw how they of the kindreds
held them firm on the way.&nbsp; Then for a moment of time he
considered and thought, till him-seemed he could see the whole
battle yet to be foughten; and his face flushed, and he said
sharply: &lsquo;Bow-may, abide here and shoot, and show the
others where to shoot, while the arrows hold out; but we will go
further for a while, and ye shall follow when we have made the
rent great enough.&rsquo;
She turned to him and said: &lsquo;Why art thou not more
joyous? thou art like an host without music or
banners.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;heed not me, but my
bidding!&rsquo;
She said hastily: &lsquo;I think I shall die here; since for
all we have shot we minish them nowise.&nbsp; Now kiss me this
once amidst the battle, and say farewell.&rsquo;
p. 346He
said: &lsquo;Nay, nay; it shall not go thus.&nbsp; Abide a little
while, and thou shalt see all this tangle open, as the sun
cleaveth the clouds on the autumn morning.&nbsp; Yet lo thou!
since thou wilt have it so.&rsquo;
And he bent forward and kissed her face, and now the tears ran
over it, and she said smiling somewhat: &lsquo;Now is this more
than I looked for, whatso may betide.&rsquo;
But while she was yet speaking he cried in a great voice:
&lsquo;Ye who have spent your shot, or have nigh spent it, to
axe and sword, and follow me to clear the ground &rsquo;twixt the
bent and the halls.&nbsp; Let each help each, but throng not each
other.&nbsp; Shoot wisely, ye bowmen, and keep our backs clear of
the foe.&nbsp; On, on! for the Burg and the Face, for the Burg
and the Face!&rsquo;
Therewith he leapt down the steep of the hill, bounding like
the hart, with Dale-warden naked in his hand; and they that
followed were two score and ten; and the arrows of their bowmen
rained over their heads on the Dusky Men, as they smote down the
first of the foemen, and the others shrieked and shrank from
them, or turned on them smiting wildly and desperately.
But Face-of-god swept round the great sword and plunged into
that sea of turmoil and noise and evil sights and savours, and
even therewith he heard clearly a voice that said:
&lsquo;Goldring, I am hurt; take my bow a while!&rsquo; and knew
it for Bow-may&rsquo;s; but it came to his ears like the song of
a bird without meaning; for it was as if his life were changed at
once; and in a minute or two he had cut thrice with the edge and
thrust twice with the point, eager, but clear-eyed and deft; and
he saw as in a picture the foe before him, and the grey roofs of
Silver-stead, and through the gap in them the tops of the blue
ridges far aloof.&nbsp; And now had three fallen before him, and
they feared him, and turned on him, and smote so many together
that their strokes crossed each other, and one warded him from
the other; and he laughed aloud and shielded himself, and drave
the point of Dale-warden amidst the tangle of weapons through the
open p.
347mouth of a captain of the Felons, and slashed a cheek
with a back-stroke, and swept round the edge to his right hand
and smote off a blue-eyed snub-nosed head; and therewith a
pole-axe smote him on the left side of his helm, so that he
tottered; but he swung himself round, and stood stark and
upright, and gave a short hack with the edge, keeping Dale-warden
well in hand, and a gold-clad felon, a champion of them, and
their tallest on the ground, fell aback, his throat gaping more
than the mouth of him.
Then Face-of-god shouted and waved Dale-warden aloft to the
Banner of the Wolf that floated behind and above him, and he
cried out: &lsquo;As I have promised so have I done!&rsquo;&nbsp;
And he looked about, and beheld how valiantly his fellows had
been doing; for before him now was a space of earth with no man
standing on his feet thereon, like the swathe of the mowers of
June; and beyond that was the crowd of the Dusky Men wavering
like the tall grass abiding the scythe.
But a minute, and they fell to casting at Face-of-god and his
fellows spears and knives and shields and whatsoever would fly;
and a spear smote him on the breast, but entered not; and a
bossed shield fell over his face withal, and a plummet of
sling-lead smote his helm, and he fell to earth; but leapt up
again straightway, and heard as he arose a great shout close to
him, and a shrill cry, and lo! at his left side Bow-may, her
sword in her hand, and the hand red with blood from a shaft-graze
on her wrist, and a white cloth stained with blood about her
neck; and on his right side Wood-wise bearing the banner and
crying the Wolf-whoop; for the whole company was come down from
the slope and stood around him.
Then for a little while was there such a stilling of the
tumult about him there, that he heard great and glad cries from
the Road of the South of &lsquo;The Burg and the Steer!&nbsp; The
Dale and the Bridge!&nbsp; The Dale and the Bull!&rsquo;&nbsp;
And thereafter a terrible great shrieking cry, and a huge voice
that cried: &lsquo;Death,  span
class="pagenum">p. 348death, death to the Dusky
Men!&rsquo;&nbsp; And thereafter again fierce cries and great
tumult of the battle.
Then Face-of-god shook Dale-warden in the air, and strode
forward fiercely, but not speedily, and the whole company went
foot for foot along with him; and as he went, would he or would
he not, song came into his mouth, a song of the meadows of the
Dale, even such as this:
The wheat is done blooming and rust&rsquo;s on
the sickle,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And green are the meadows grown after the scythe. br
/>
Come, hands for the dance!&nbsp; For the toil hath been
mickle,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And &rsquo;twixt haysel and harvest &rsquo;tis time
to be blithe.
And what shall the tale be now dancing is
over,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And kind on the meadow sits maiden by man,
And the old man bethinks him of days of the lover,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the warrior remembers the field that he wan?
Shall we tell of the dear days wherein we are
dwelling,
&nbsp;&nbsp; The best days of our Mother, the cherishing Dale, br
/>
When all round about us the summer is telling,
&nbsp;&nbsp; To ears that may hearken, the heart of the tale?
Shall we sing of these hands and these lips
that caress us,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the limbs that sun-dappled lie light here
beside,
When still in the morning they rise but to bless us,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And oft in the midnight our footsteps abide?
O nay, but to tell of the fathers were
better,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And of how we were fashioned from out of the
earth;
Of how the once lowly spurned strong at the fetter;
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the days of the deeds and beginning of mirth.
And then when the feast-tide is done in the
morning,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall we whet the grey sickle that bideth the
wheat,
p. 349Till wan
grow the edges, and gleam forth a warning
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the field and the fallow where edges shall
meet.
And when cometh the harvest, and hook upon
shoulder
&nbsp;&nbsp; We enter the red wheat from out of the road,
We shall sing, as we wend, of the bold and the bolder,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Burg of their building, the beauteous
abode.
As smiteth the sickle amid the sun&rsquo;s
burning
&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall sing how the sun saw the token unfurled, br
/>
When forth fared the Folk, with no thought of returning,
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the days when the Banner went wide in the
world.
Many saw that he was singing, but heard not the words of his
mouth, for great was the noise and clamour.&nbsp; But he heard
Bow-may, how she laughed by his side, and cried out:
&lsquo;Gold-mane, dear-heart, now art thou merry indeed; and
glad am I, though they told me that I am hurt.&mdash;Ah! now
beware, beware!&rsquo;
For indeed the Dusky Men, seeing the wall of steel rolling
down on them, and cooped up by the houses, so that they scarce
knew how to flee, turned in the face of death, the foremost of
them, and rushed furiously on the array of the Woodlanders, and
all those behind pressed on them like the big wave of the ebbing
sea when the gust of the wind driveth it landward.
The Woodlanders met them, shouting out: &lsquo;The Greenwood
and the Wolf, the Greenwood and the Wolf!&rsquo;&nbsp; But not a
few of them fell there, though they gave not back a foot; for so
fierce now were the Dusky Men, that hewing and thrusting at them
availed nought, unless they were slain outright or stunned; and
even if they fell they rolled themselves up against their tall
foe-men, heeding not death or wounds if they might but slay or
wound.&nbsp; There then fell War-grove and ten others of the
Woodlanders, and four men of the Wolf, but none before he had
slain his foeman; and as each man fell or was hurt grievously,
another took his place.
p. 350Now a
felon leapt up and caught Gold-ring by the neck and drew him
down, while another strove to smite his head off; but the stout
carle drave a wood-knife into the side of the first felon, and
drew it out speedily and smote the other, the smiter, in the face
with the same knife, and therewith they all three rolled together
on the earth amongst the feet of men.&nbsp; Even so did another
felon by Bow-may, and dragged her down to the ground, and smote
her with a long knife as she tumbled down; and this was a feat of
theirs, for they were long-armed like apes.
But as to this felon, Dale-warden&rsquo;s edge split his
skull, and Face-of-god gathered his might together and bestrode
Bow-may, till he had hewed a space round about him with great
two-handed strokes; and yet the blade brake not.&nbsp; Then he
caught up Bow-may from the earth, and the felon&rsquo;s knife had
not pierced her hauberk, but she was astonied, and might not
stand upon her feet; and Face-of-god turned aside a little with
her, and half bore her, half thrust her through the throng to the
rearward of his folk, and left her there with two carlines of the
Wolf who followed the host for leechcraft&rsquo;s sake, and then
turned back shouting: &lsquo;For the Face, for the Face!&rsquo;
and there followed him back to the battle, a band of those who
were fresh as yet, and their blades unbloodied, the young men of
the Woodlands.
The wearier fighters made way for them as they came on
shouting, and Face-of-god was ahead of them all, and leapt at the
foemen as a man unwearied and striking his first stroke, so
wondrous hale he was; and they drave a wedge amidst of the Dusky
Men, and then turned about and stood back to back hewing at all
that drifted on them.&nbsp; But as Face-of-god cleared a space
about him, lo! almost within reach of his sword-point up rose a
grim shape from the earth, tall, grey-haired, and bloody-faced,
who uttered the Wolf-whoop from amidst the terror of his visage,
and turned and swung round his head an axe of the Dusky Men, and
fell to smiting them with their own weapon.&nbsp; The Dusky Men
shrieked in answer to his whoop, and all shrunk  a
name="page351">p. 351from him
and Face-of-god; but a cry of joy went up from the kindred, for
they knew Gold-ring, whom they deemed had been slain.&nbsp; So
they all pressed on together, smiting down the foe before them,
and the Dusky Men, some turned their backs and drave those behind
them, till they too turned and were strained through the passages
and courts of the houses, and some were overthrown and trodden
down as they strove to hold face to the Woodlanders, and some
were hewn down where they stood; but the whole throng of those
that were on their feet drifted toward the Market-place, the
Woodlanders following them ever with point and edge, till betwixt
the bent and the houses no foeman stood up against them.
Then they stood together, and raised the whoop of victory, and
blew their horns long and loud in token of their joy, and the
Woodland men lifted up their voices and sang:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now far, far aloof
&nbsp;&nbsp; Standeth lintel and roof,
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dwelling of days
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the Woodland ways:
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now nought wendeth there
&nbsp;&nbsp; Save the wolf and the bear,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the fox of the waste
&nbsp;&nbsp; Faring soft without haste.
No carle the axe whetteth on oak-laden hill;
No shaft the hart letteth to wend at his will;
None heedeth the thunder-clap over the glade,
And the wind-storm thereunder makes no man afraid.
Is it thus then that endeth man&rsquo;s days on Mid-earth,
For no man there wendeth in sorrow or mirth?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, look down on the road br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the ancient abode!
&nbsp;&nbsp; Betwixt acre and field
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shineth helm, shineth shield.
&nbsp;&nbsp; p.
352And high over the heath
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fares the bane in his sheath;
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the wise men and bold
&nbsp;&nbsp; Go their ways o&rsquo;er the wold.
Now the Warrior hath given them heart and fair day,
Unbidden, undriven, they fare to the fray.
By the rock and the river the banners they bear,
And their battle-staves quiver &rsquo;neath halbert and spear; br
/>
On the hill&rsquo;s brow they gather, and hang o&rsquo;er the
Dale
As the clouds of the Father hang, laden with bale.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down shineth the sun
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the war-deed half done;
&nbsp;&nbsp; All the fore-doomed to die,
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the pale dust they lie.
&nbsp;&nbsp; There they leapt, there they fell,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And their tale shall we tell;
&nbsp;&nbsp; But we, e&rsquo;en in the gate
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the war-garth we wait,
Till the drift of war-weather shall whistle us on,
And we tread all together the way to be won,
To the dear land, the dwelling for whose sake we came
To do deeds for the telling of song-becrowned fame.
Settle helm on the head then!&nbsp; Heave sword for the Dale! br
/>
Nor be mocked of the dead men for deedless and pale.
CHAPTER XLVI.&nbsp; MEN MEET IN THE MARKET OF
SILVER-STEAD.
So sang they; but Face-of-god went
with Red-wolf, who was hurt sorely, but not deadly, and led him
back toward the place just under the break of the bent; and there
he found Bow-may in the hands of the women who were tending her
hurts.&nbsp; She p.
353smiled on him from a pale face as he drew nigh, and he
looked kindly at her, but he might not abide there, for haste was
in his feet.&nbsp; He left Red-wolf to the tending of the women,
and clomb the bent hastily, and when he deemed he was high
enough, he looked about him; and somewhat more than half an hour
had worn since Bow-may had sped the first shaft against the Dusky
Men.
He looked down into the Market-stead, and deemed he could see
that nigh the Mote-house the Dusky Men were gathering into some
better order; but they were no longer drifting toward the
southern bents, but were standing round about the altar as men
abiding somewhat; and he deemed that they had gotten more bowshot
than before, and that most of them bare bows.&nbsp; Though so
many had been slain in the battles of the southern bents, yet was
the Market-stead full of them, so to say, for others had come
thereto in place of those that had fallen.
But now as he looked arose mighty clamour amongst them; and a
little west of the Altar was a stir and a hurrying onward and
around as in the eddies of a swift stream.&nbsp; Face-of-god
wotted not what was betiding there, but he deemed that they were
now ware of the onfall of Folk-might and Hall-face and the men of
Burgdale, for their faces were all turned to where that was to be
looked for.
So he turned and looked on the road to the east of him, where
had been the battle of the Steer, but now it was all gone down
toward the Market-place, and he could but hear the clamour of it;
but nought he saw thereof, because of the houses that hid it.
Then he cast his eyes on the road that entered the
Market-stead from the north, and he saw thereon many men
gathered; and he wotted not what they were; for though there were
weapons amongst them, yet were they not all weaponed, as far as
he could see.
Now as he looked this way and that, and deemed that he must
tarry no longer, but must enter into the courts of the houses  a
name="page354">p. 354before him
and make his way into the Market-stead, lo! a change in the
throng of Dusky Warriors nigh the Mote-house, and the ordered
bands about the Altar fell to drifting toward the western way
with one accord, with great noise and hurry and fierce cries of
wrath.&nbsp; Then made Face-of-god no delay, but ran down the
bent at once, and at the break of it came upon Bow-may standing
upright and sword in hand; and as he passed, she joined herself
to him, and said: &lsquo;What new tidings now,
Gold-mane?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Tidings of battle!&rsquo; he cried; &lsquo;tidings of
victory!&nbsp; Folk-might hath fallen on, and the Dusky Men run
hastily to meet him.&nbsp; Hark, hark!&rsquo;
For as he spoke came a great noise of horns, and Bow-may said:
&lsquo;What horn is that blowing?&rsquo;
He stayed not, but shouted aloud: &lsquo;For the Face, for the
Face!&nbsp; Now will we fall upon their backs!&rsquo;
Therewith was he come to his company, and he cried out to
them: &lsquo;Heard ye the horn, heard ye the horn?&nbsp; Now
follow me into the Market-place; much is yet to do!&rsquo;
Even therewith came the sound of other horns, and all men were
silent a moment, and then shouted all together, for the
Wood-landers knew it for the horn of the Shepherds coming on by
the eastward way.
But Face-of-god waved his sword aloft and set on at once, and
they followed and gat them through the courts of the houses and
their passages into the Market-place.&nbsp; There they found more
room than they looked to find; for the foemen had drawn away on
the left hand toward the battle of Folk-might, and on the right
hand toward the battle of the Steer; and great was the noise and
cry that came thence.
Now stood Face-of-god under the two banners of the Wolf in the
Market-place of Silver-stead, and scarce had he time to be
high-hearted, for needs must he ponder in his mind what thing
were best to do.&nbsp; For on the left hand he deemed the foe was
the p.
355strongest and best ordered; but there also were the
kindreds the doughtiest, and it was little like that the felons
should overcome the spear-casters of the Face and the
glaive-bearers of the Sickle, and the bowmen of the Vine: there
also were the wisest leaders, as the stark elder Stone-face, and
the tall Hall-face, and his father of the unshaken heart, and
above all Folk-might, fierce in his wrath, but his anger burning
steady and clear, like the oaken butt on the hearth of the
hall.
Then as his mind pictured him amongst the foe, it made
therewith another picture of the slender warrior Sun-beam caught
in the tangle of battle, and longing for him and calling for him
amidst the hard hand-play.&nbsp; And thereat his face flushed,
and all his body waxed hot, and he was on the very point of
leading the onset against the foe on the left.&nbsp; But
therewith he bethought him of the bold men of the Steer and the
Bridge and the Bull weary with much fighting; and he remembered
also that the Bride was amongst them and fighting, it might be,
amidst the foremost, and if she were slain how should he ever
hold up his head again.&nbsp; He bethought him also that the
Shepherds, who had fallen on by the eastern road, valiant as they
were, were scarce so well armed or so well led as the
others.&nbsp; Therewithal he bethought him (and again it came
like a picture into his mind) of falling on the foemen by whom
the southern battle was beset, and then the twain of them meeting
the Shepherds, and lastly, all those three companies joined
together clearing the Market-place, and meeting the men under
Folk-might in the midst thereof.
Therefore, scant had he been pondering these things in his
mind for a minute ere he cried out: &lsquo;Blow up horns, blow
up! forward banners, and follow me, O valiant men! to the helping
of the Steer, the Bridge, and the Bull; deep have they thrust
into the Dusky Throng, and belike are hard pressed.&nbsp; Hark
how the clamour ariseth from their besetters!&nbsp; On now,
on!&rsquo;
Therewith hung a star of sunlight on his sword as he raised it
aloft, and the Wolf-whoop rang out terribly in the Market-place,
p. 356for now
had the Woodlanders also learned it, and the hearts of the foemen
sank as they heard the might and the mass thereof.&nbsp; Then the
battle of the Woodlanders swept round and fell upon the flank of
them who were besetting the kindreds, as an iron bar smiteth the
soft fir-wood; and they of the kindreds heard their cry, but
faintly and confusedly, so great was the turmoil of battle about
them.
Now once more was Bow-may by the side of Face-of-god; and if
she had not the might of the mightiest, yet had she the deftness
of the deftest.&nbsp; And now was she calm and cool, shielding
herself with a copper-bossed target, and driving home the point
of her sharp sword; white was her face, and her eyes glittered
amidst it, and she seemed to men like to those on whose heads the
Warrior hath laid the Holy Bread.
As to Wood-wise, he had given the Banner of the red-jawed Wolf
to Stone-wolf, a huge and dreadful warrior some forty winters
old, who had fought in the Great Overthrow, and now hewed down
the Dusky Men, wielding a heavy short-sword left-handed.&nbsp;
But Wood-wise himself fought with a great sword, giving great
strokes to the right hand and the left, and was no more hasty
than is the hewer in the winter wood.
Face-of-god fought wisely and coldly now, and looked more to
warding his friends than destroying his foes, and both to Bow-may
and Wood-wise his sword was a shield; for oft he took the life
from the edge of the upraised axe, and stayed the point of the
foeman in mid-air.
Even so wisely fought the whole band of the Woodlanders and
the Wolves, who got within smiting space of the foe; for they had
no will to cast away their lives when assured victory was so nigh
to them.&nbsp; Sooth to say, the hand-play was not so hard to
them as it had been betwixt the bent and the houses; for the
Dusky Men were intent on dealing with the men of the kindreds
from the southern road, who stood war-wearied before them; and
they were hewing and casting at them, and baying  a
name="page357">p. 357and yelling
like dogs; and though they turned about to meet the storm of the
Woodlanders, yet their hearts failed them withal, and they strove
to edge away from betwixt those two fearful scythes of war,
fighting as men fleeing, not as men in onset.&nbsp; But still the
Woodlanders and the Wolves came on, hewing and thrusting, smiting
down the foemen in heaps, till the Dusky Throng grew thin, and
the staves of the Dalesmen and their bright banners in the
morning sun were clear to see, and at last their very faces,
kindly and familiar, worn and strained with the stress of battle,
or laughing wildly, or pale with the fury of the fight.&nbsp;
Then rose up to the heavens the blended shout of the Woodlanders
and the Dalesmen, and now there was nought of foemen betwixt them
save the dead and the wounded.
Then Face-of-god thrust his sword into its sheath all bloody
as it was, and strode over the dead men to where Hall-ward stood
under the banner of the Steer, and cast his arms about the old
carle, and kissed him for joy of the victory.&nbsp; But Hall-ward
thrust him aback and looked him in the face, and his cheeks were
pale and his lips clenched, and his eyes haggard and staring, and
he said in a harsh voice:
&lsquo;O young man, she is dead!&nbsp; I saw her fall.&nbsp;
The Bride is dead, and thou hast lost thy troth-plight maiden. O
death, death to the Dusky Men!&rsquo;
Then grew Face-of-god as pale as a linen sleeve, and all the
new-comers groaned and cried out.&nbsp; But a bystander said:
&lsquo;Nay, nay, it is nought so bad as that; she is hurt, and
sorely; but she liveth yet.&rsquo;
Face-of-god heard him not.&nbsp; He forgot Dale-warden lying
in his sheath, and he saw that the last speaker had a great
wood-axe broad and heavy in his hand, so he cried: &lsquo;Man,
man, thine axe!&rsquo; and snatched it from him, and turned about
to the foe again, and thrust through the ranks, suffering none to
stay him till all his friends were behind and all his foes before
him.&nbsp; And as he burst forth from the ranks waving his axe
aloft, bare-headed p.
358now, his yellow hair flying abroad, his mouth crying
out, &lsquo;Death, death, death to the Dusky Men!&rsquo; fear of
him smote their hearts, and they howled and fled before him as
they might; for they said that the Dalesmen had prayed their Gods
into the battle.&nbsp; But not so fast could they flee but he was
presently amidst them, smiting down all about him, and they so
terror-stricken that scarce might they raise a hand against
him.&nbsp; All that blended host followed him mad with wrath and
victory, and as they pressed on, they heard behind them the horns
and war-cries of the Shepherds falling on from the east.&nbsp;
Nought they heeded that now, but drave on a fearful storm of war,
and terrible was the slaughter of the Felons.
It was but a few minutes ere they had driven them up against
that great stack of faggots that had been dight for the
burnt-offering of men, and many of the felons had mounted up on
to it, and now in their anguish of fear were shooting arrows and
casting spears on all about them, heeding little if they were
friend or foe.&nbsp; Now were the men of the kindreds at point to
climb this twiggen burg; but by this time the fury of Face-of-god
had run clear, and he knew where he was and what he was doing; so
he stayed his folk, and cried out to them: &lsquo;Forbear, climb
not! let the torch help the sword!&rsquo;&nbsp; And therewith he
looked about and saw the fire-pot which had been set down there
for the kindling of the bale-fire, and the coals were yet red in
it; so he snatched up a dry brand and lighted it thereat, and so
did divers others, and they thrust them among the faggots, and
the fire caught at once, and the tongues of flame began to leap
from faggot to faggot till all was in a light low; for the wood
had been laid for that very end, and smeared with grease and oil
so that the burning to the god might be speedy.
But the fierceness of the kindreds heeded not the fire, nor
overmuch the men who leapt down from the stack before it, but
they left all behind them, faring straight toward the western
outgate from the Market-stead; and Face-of-god still led them on;
p. 359though
by now he was wholly come to his right mind again, albeit the
burden of sorrow yet lay heavy on his heart.&nbsp; He had broken
his axe, and had once more drawn Dale-warden from his sheath, and
many felt his point and edge.
But now, as they chased, came a rush of men upon them again,
as though a new onset were at hand.&nbsp; That saw Face-of-god
and Hall-ward and War-well, and other wise leaders of men, and
they bade their folk forbear the chase, and lock their ranks to
meet the onfall of this new wave of foemen.&nbsp; And they did
so, and stood fast as a wall; but lo! the onrush that drave up
against them was but a fleeing shrieking throng, and no longer an
array of warriors, for many had cast away their weapons, and were
rushing they knew not whither; for they were being thrust on the
bitter edges of Face-of-god&rsquo;s companies by the terror of
the fleers from the onset of the men of the Face, the Sickle, and
the Vine, whom Hall-face and Stone-face were leading, along with
Folk-might.&nbsp; Then once again the men of Face-of-god gave
forth the whoop of victory, and pressed forward again, hewing
their way through the throng of fleers, but turning not to chase
to the right or the left; while at their backs came on the
Shepherd-folk, who had swept down all that withstood them; for
now indeed was the Market-stead getting thinner of living
men.
So led the War-leader his ordered ranks, till at last over the
tangled crowd of runaways he saw the banners of the Burg and the
Face flashing against the sun, and heard the roar of the kindreds
as they drave the chase towards them.&nbsp; Then he lifted up his
sword, and stood still, and all the host behind him stayed and
cast a huge shout up to the heavens, and there they abode the
coming of the other Dalesmen.
But the War-leader sent a message to Hound-under-Greenbury,
bidding him lead the Shepherds to the chase of the Dusky Men, who
were now all fleeing toward the northern outgate of the
Market.&nbsp; Howbeit he called to mind the throng he had seen on
the northern road before they were come into the Market-stead,  a
name="page360">p. 360and deemed
that way also death awaited the foemen, even if the men of the
kindreds forbore them.
But presently the space betwixt the Woodlanders and the men of
the Face was clear of all but the dead, so that friend saw the
face of friend; and it could be seen that the warriors of the
Face were ruddy and smiling for joy, because the battle had been
easy to them, and but few of them had fallen; for the Dusky Men
who had left the Market-stead to fall on them, had had room for
fleeing behind them, and had speedily turned their backs before
the spear-casting of the men of the Face and the onrush of the
swordsmen.
There then stood these victorious men facing one another, and
the banner-bearers on either side came through the throng, and
brought the banners together between the two hosts; and the Wolf
kissed the Face, and the Sickle and the Vine met the Steer and
the Bridge and the Bull: but the Shepherds were yet chasing the
fleers.
There in the forefront stood Hall-face the tall, with the joy
of battle in his eyes.&nbsp; And Stone-face, the wise carle in
war, stood solemn and stark beside him; and there was the goodly
body and the fair and kindly visage of the Alderman smiling on
the faces of his friends.&nbsp; But as for Folk-might, his face
was yet white and aweful with anger, and he looked restlessly up
and down the front of the kindreds, though he spake no word.
Then Face-of-god could no longer forbear, but he thrust
Dale-warden into his sheath, and ran forward and cast his arms
about his father&rsquo;s neck and kissed him; and the blood of
himself and of the foemen was on him, for he had been hurt in
divers places, but not sorely, because of the good hammer-work of
the Alderman.
Then he kissed his brother and Stone-face, and he took
Folk-might by the hand, and was on the point of speaking some
word to him, when the ranks of the Face opened, and lo! the
Sun-beam in her bright war-gear, and the sword girt to her side,
and she unhurt and unsullied.
p. 361Then
was it to him as when he met her first in Shadowy Vale, and he
thought of little else than her; but she stepped lightly up to
him, and unashamed before the whole host she kissed him on the
mouth, and he cast his mailed arms about her, and joy made him
forget many things and what was next to do, though even at that
moment came afresh a great clamour of shrieks and cries from the
northern outgate of the Market-stead: and the burning pile behind
them cast a great wavering flame into the air, contending with
the bright sun of that fair day, now come hard on noontide.&nbsp;
But ere he drew away his face from the Sun-beam&rsquo;s, came
memory to him, and a sharp pang shot through his heart, as he
heard Folk-might say: &lsquo;Where then is the Shield-may of
Burgstead? where is the Bride?&rsquo;
And Face-of-god said under his breath: &lsquo;She is dead, she
is dead!&rsquo;&nbsp; And then he stared out straight before him
and waited till someone else should say it aloud.&nbsp; But
Bow-may stepped forward and said: &lsquo;Chief of the Wolf, be of
good cheer; our kinswoman is hurt, but not deadly.&rsquo;
The Alderman&rsquo;s face changed, and he said: &lsquo;Hast
thou seen her, Bow-may?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;How should I leave
the battle? but others have told me who have seen her.&rsquo;
Folk-might stared into the ranks of men before him, but said
nothing.&nbsp; Said the Alderman: &lsquo;Is she well
tended?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, surely,&rsquo; said Bow-may, &lsquo;since she is
amongst friends, and there are no foemen behind us.&rsquo;
Then came a voice from Folk-might which said: &lsquo;Now were
it best to send good men and deft in arms, and who know
Silver-dale, from house to house, to search for foemen who may be
lurking there.&rsquo;
The Alderman looked kindly and sadly on him and said:
&lsquo;Kinsman Stone-face, and Hall-face my son, the brunt of
the battle is now over, and I am but a simple man amongst you;
therefore, if ye will give me leave, I will go see this poor
kinswoman of ours, and comfort her.&rsquo;
p. 362They
bade him go: so he sheathed his sword, and went through the press
with two men of the Steer toward the southern road; for the Bride
had been brought into a house nigh the corner of the
Market-place.
But Face-of-god looked after his father as he went, and
remembrance of past days came upon him, and such a storm of grief
swept over him, as he thought of the Bride lying pale and
bleeding and brought anigh to her death, that he put his hands to
his face and wept as a child that will not be comforted; nor had
he any shame of all those bystanders, who in sooth were men good
and kindly, and had no shame of his grief or marvelled at it, for
indeed their own hearts were sore for their lovely kinswoman, and
many of them also wept with Face-of-god.&nbsp; But the Sun-beam
stood by and looked on her betrothed, and she thought many things
of the Bride, and was sorry, albeit no tears came into her eyes;
then she looked askance at Folk-might and trembled; but he said
coldly, and in a loud voice:
&lsquo;Needs must we search the houses for the lurking felons,
or many a man will yet be murdered.&nbsp; Let Wood-wicked lead a
band of men at once from house to house.&rsquo;
Then said a man of the Wolf hight Hardgrip: &lsquo;Wood-wicked
was slain betwixt the bent and the houses.&rsquo;
Said Folk-might: &lsquo;Let it be Wood-wise then.&rsquo;
But Bow-may said: &lsquo;Wood-wise is even now hurt in the leg
by a wounded felon, and may not go afoot.&rsquo;
Then said Folk-might: &lsquo;Is Crow the Shaft-speeder
anigh?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, here am I,&rsquo; quoth a tall man of fifty
winters, coming from out the ranks where stood the Wolves.
Said Folk-might: &lsquo;Kinsman Crow, do thou take two score
and ten of doughty men who are not too hot-headed, and search
every house about the Market-place; but if ye come on any house
that makes a stout defence, send ye word thereof to the
Mote-house, where we will presently be, and we shall send you
help.&nbsp; Slay every felon that ye fall in with; but if ye find
in the p.
363houses any of the poor folk crouching and afraid,
comfort their hearts all ye may, and tell them that now is life
come to them.&rsquo;
So Crow fell to getting his band together, and presently
departed with them on his errand.
CHAPTER XLVII.&nbsp; THE KINDREDS WIN THE MOTE-HOUSE.
The din and tumult still came from
the north side of the Market-place, so that all the air was full
of noise; and Face-of-god deemed that the thralls had gotten
weapons into their hands and were slaying their masters.
Now he lifted up his face, and put his hand on
Folk-might&rsquo;s shoulder, and said in a loud voice:
&lsquo;Kinsmen, it were well if our brother were to bid the
banners into the Mote-house of the Wolf, and let all the Host set
itself in array before the said house, and abide till the chasers
of the foe come to us thither; for I perceive that they are now
become many, and are more than those of our kindred.&rsquo;
Then Folk-might looked at him with kind eyes, and said:
&lsquo;Thou sayest well, brother; even so let it
be!&rsquo;
And he lifted up his sword, and Face-of-god cried out in a
loud voice: &lsquo;Forward, banners! blow up horns! fare we forth
with victory!&rsquo;
So the Host drew its ranks together in good order, and they
all set forward, and old Stone-face took the Sun-beam by the hand
and led on behind Folk-might and the War-leader.&nbsp; But when
they came to the Hall, then saw they how the steps that led up to
the door were high and double, going up from each side without
any railing or fool-guard; and crowding the stairs and the
platform thereof was a band of the Dusky Men, as many as could
stand thereon, who shot arrows at the host of the kindreds,
howling like dogs, and chattering like apes; and arrows and  a
name="page364">p. 364spears came
from the windows of the Hall; yea, and on the very roof a score
of these felons were riding the ridge and mocking like the trolls
of old days.
Now when they saw this they stayed a while, and men shielded
them against the shafts; but the leaders drew together in front
of the Host, and Folk-might fell to speech; and his face was very
pale and stern; for now he had had time to think of the case of
the Bride, and fierce wrath, and grief unholpen filled his
soul.&nbsp; So he said:
&lsquo;Brothers, this is my business to deal with; for I see
before me the stair that leadeth to the Mote-house of my people,
and now would I sit there whereas my fathers sat, when peace was
on the Dale, as once more it shall be to-morrow.&nbsp; Therefore
up this stair will I go, and none shall hinder me; and let no man
of the host follow me till I have entered into the Hall, unless
perchance I fall dead by the way; but stand ye still and look
on.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;this is partly the
business of the War-leader.&nbsp; There are two stairs.&nbsp; Be
content to take the southern one, and I will take the
northern.&nbsp; We shall meet on the plain stone at the
top.&rsquo;
But Hall-face said: &lsquo;War-leader, may I speak?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Speak, brother,&rsquo; said Face-of-god.
Said Hall-face: &lsquo;I have done but little to-day,
War-leader.&nbsp; I would stand by thee on the northern stair; so
shall Folk-might be content, if he doeth two men&rsquo;s work who
are not little-hearted.&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;The doom of the War-leader is that
Folk-might shall fall on by the southern stair to slake his grief
and increase his glory, and Face-of-god and Hall-face by the
northern.&nbsp; Haste to the work, O brothers!&rsquo;
And he and Hall-face went to their places, while all looked
on.&nbsp; But the Sun-beam, with her hand still in
Stone-face&rsquo;s, she turned white to the lips, and stared with
wild eyes before her, not knowing where she was; for she had
deemed that the battle was over, and Face-of-god saved from
it.
p. 365But
Folk-might tossed up his head and laughed, and cried out,
&lsquo;At last, at last!&rsquo;&nbsp; And his sword was in his
hand, the Sleep-thorn to wit, a blade of ancient fame; so now he
let it fall and hang to his wrist by the leash, while he clapped
his hands together and uttered the Wolf-whoop mightily, and all
the men of the Wolf that were in the host, and the Woodlanders
withal, uttered it with him.&nbsp; Then he put his shield over
his head and stood before the first of the steps, and the Dusky
Men laughed to see one man come against them, though there was
death in their hearts.&nbsp; But he laughed back at them in
triumph, and set his foot on the step, and let
Sleep-thorn&rsquo;s point go into the throat of a Dusky lord, and
thrust amongst them, hewing right and left, and tumbling men over
the edge of the stair, which was to them as the narrow path along
the cliff-side that hangeth over the unfathomed sea.&nbsp; They
hewed and thrust at him in turn; but so close were they packed
that their weapons crossed about him, and one shielded him from
the other, and they swayed staggering on that fearful verge,
while the Sleep-thorn crept here and there amongst them, lulling
their hot fury.&nbsp; For, as desperate as they were, and
fighting for death and not for life, they had a horror of him and
of the sea of hatred below them, and feared where to set their
feet, and he feared nought at all, but from feet to sword-point
was but an engine of slaughter, while the heart within him
throbbed with fury long held back as he thought upon the Bride
and her wounding, and all the wrongs of his people since their
Great Undoing.
So he smote and thrust, till him-seemed the throng of foes
thinned before him: with his sword-pommel he smote a lord of the
Dusky Ones in the face, so that he fell over the edge amongst the
spears of the kindred; then he thrust the point of Sleep-thorn
towards the Hall-door through the breast of another, and then it
seemed to him that he had but one before him; so he hove up the
edges to cleave him down, but ere the stroke fell, close to his
ears exceeding loud rang out the cry, &lsquo;For the Burg and the
Face! for the Face, for the Face!&rsquo; and he drew aback a
little, and his eyes  span
class="pagenum">p. 366cleared, and lo! it was Hall-face
the tall, his long sword all reddened with battle; and beside him
stood Face-of-god, silent and panting, his face pale with the
fierce anger of the fight, and the weariness which was now at
last gaining upon him.&nbsp; There stood those three with no
other living man upon the plain of the stairs.
Then Face-of-god turned shouting to the Folk, and cried:
&lsquo;Forth now with the banners!&nbsp; For now is the Wolf
come home.&nbsp; On into the Hall, O Kindred of the
Gods!&rsquo;
Then poured the Folk up over the stairs and into the Hall of
the Wolf, the banners flapping over their heads; and first went
the War-leader and Folk-might and Hall-face, and then the three
delivered thralls, Wolf-stone, God-swain, and Spear-fist, and
Dallach with them, though both he and Wolf-stone had been hurt in
the battle; and then came blended together the Men of the Face
along with them of the Wolf who had entered the Market-stead with
them, and with these were Stone-face and Wood-wont and Bow-may,
leading the Sun-beam betwixt them; and now was she come to
herself again, though her face was yet pale, and her eyes gleamed
as she stepped across the threshold of the Hall.
But when a many were gotten in, and the first-comers had had
time to handle their weapons and look about them, a cry of the
utmost wrath broke from Folk-might and those others who
remembered the Hall from of old.&nbsp; For wretched and befouled
was that well-builded house: the hangings rent away; the goodly
painted walls daubed and smeared with wicked tokens of the Alien
murderers: the floor, once bright with polished stones of the
mountain, and strewn with sweet-smelling flowers, was now as foul
as the den of the man-devouring troll of the heaths.&nbsp; From
the fair-carven roof of oak and chestnut-beams hung ugly knots of
rags and shapeless images of the sorcery of the Dusky Men.&nbsp;
And furthermore, and above all, from the last tie-beam of the
roof over the da&iuml;s dangled four shapes of men-at-arms, whom
the older men of the Wolf knew at once for the embalmed bodies of
their four great chieftains, who had been slain on the day of the
p. 367Great
Undoing; and they cried out with horror and rage as they saw them
hanging there in their weapons as they had lived.
There was the Hostage of the Earth, his shield painted with
the green world circled with the worm of the sea.&nbsp; There was
the older Folk-might, the uncle of the living man, bearing a
shield with an oak and a lion done thereon.&nbsp; There was
Wealth-eker, on whose shield was done a golden sheaf of
wheat.&nbsp; There was he who bore a name great from of old,
Folk-wolf to wit, bearing on his shield the axe of the
hewer.&nbsp; There they hung, dusty, befouled, with sightless
eyes and grinning mouths, in the dimmed sunlight of the Hall,
before the eyes of that victorious Host, stricken silent at the
sight of them.
Underneath them on the da&iuml;s stood the last remnant of the
battle of the Dusky Men; and they, as men mad with coming death,
shook their weapons, and with shrieking laughter mocked at the
overcomers, and pointed to the long-dead chiefs, and called on
them in the tongue of the kindreds to come down and lead their
dear kinsmen to the high-seat; and then they cried out to the
living warriors of the Wolf, and bade them better their deed of
slaying, and set to work to make alive again, and cause their
kinsmen to live merry on the earth.
With that last mock they handled their weapons and rushed
howling on the warriors to meet their death; nor was it long
denied them; for the sword of the Wolf, the axe of the Woodland,
and the spear of the Dale soon made an end of the dreadful lives
of these destroyers of the Folks.
CHAPTER XLVIII.&nbsp; MEN SING IN THE MOTE-HOUSE.
Then strode the Warriors of the
Wolf over the bodies of the slain on to the da&iuml;s of their
own Hall; and Folk-might led the Sun-beam by the hand, and now
was his sword in its sheath, and his face was grown calm, though
it was stern and p.
368sad.&nbsp; But even as he trod the da&iuml;s comes a
slim swain of the Wolves twisting himself through the throng, and
so maketh way to Folk-might, and saith to him:
&lsquo;Chieftain, the Alderman of Burgdale sendeth me hither
to say a word to thee; even this, which I am to tell to thee and
the War-leader both: It is most true that our kinswoman the Bride
will not die, but live.&nbsp; So help me, the Warrior and the
Face!&nbsp; This is the word of the Alderman.&rsquo;
When Folk-might heard this, his face changed and he hung his
head; and Face-of-god, who was standing close by, beheld him and
deemed that tears were falling from his eyes on to the
hall-floor.&nbsp; As for him, he grew exceeding glad, and he
turned to the Sun-beam and met her eyes, and saw that she could
scarce refrain her longing for him; and he was abashed for the
sweetness of his love.&nbsp; But she drew close up to him, and
spake to him softly and said:
&lsquo;This is the day that maketh amends; and yet I long for
another day.&nbsp; When I saw thee coming to me that first day in
Shadowy Vale, I thought thee so goodly a warrior that my heart
was in my mouth.&nbsp; But now how goodly thou art!&nbsp; For the
battle is over, and we shall live.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;and none shall
begrudge us our love.&nbsp; Behold thy brother, the hard-heart,
the warrior; he weepeth because he hath heard that the Bride
shall live.&nbsp; Be sure then that she shall not gainsay
him.&nbsp; O fair shall the world be to-morrow!&rsquo;
But she said: &lsquo;O Gold-mane, I have no words.&nbsp; Is
there no minstrelsy amongst us?&rsquo;
Now by this time were many of the men  a
name="page369">p. 369of the Wolf
and the Woodlanders gathered on the da&iuml;s of the Hall; and
the Dalesmen noting this, and wotting that these men were now in
their own Mote-house, withdrew them as they might for the press
toward the nether end thereof.&nbsp; That the Sun-beam noted, and
that all those about her save the War-leader were of the kindreds
of the Wolf and the Woodland, and, still speaking softly, she
said to Face-of-god:
&lsquo;Gold-mane, meseemeth I am now in my wrong place; for
now the Wolf raiseth up his head, but I am departing from
him.&nbsp; Surely I should now be standing amongst my people of
the Face, whereto I am going ere long.&rsquo;
He said: &lsquo;Beloved, I am now become thy kindred and thine
home, and it is meet for thee to stand beside me.&rsquo;
She cast her eyes adown and answered not; and she fell
a-pondering of how sorely she had desired that fair dale, and now
she would leave it, and be content and more than content.
But now the kindreds had sundered, they upon the da&iuml;s
ranked themselves together there in the House which their fathers
had builded; and when they saw themselves so meetly ordered,
their hearts being full with the sweetness of hope accomplished
and the joy of deliverance from death, song arose amongst them,
and they fell to singing together; and this is somewhat of their
singing:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now raise we the lay
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the long-coming day!
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bright, white was the sun
&nbsp;&nbsp; When we saw it begun:
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er its noon now we live;
&nbsp;&nbsp; It hath ceased not to give;
&nbsp;&nbsp; It shall give, and give more
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the wealth of its store.
O fair was the yesterday!&nbsp; Kindly and good
Was the wasteland our guester, and kind was the wood;
Though below us for reaping lay under our hand
The harvest of weeping, the grief of the land;
Dumb cowered the sorrow, nought daring to cry
On the help of to-morrow, the deed drawing nigh.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; span
class="pagenum">p. 370All increase throve
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Dale of our love;
&nbsp;&nbsp; There the ox and the steed
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fed down the mead;
&nbsp;&nbsp; The grapes hung high
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twixt earth and sky,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the apples fell
&nbsp;&nbsp; Round the orchard well.
Yet drear was the land there, and all was for nought;
None put forth a hand there for what the year wrought,
And raised it o&rsquo;erflowing with gifts of the earth.
For man&rsquo;s grief was growing beside of the mirth
Of the springs and the summers that wasted their wealth;
And the birds, the new-comers, made merry by stealth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet here of old
&nbsp;&nbsp; Abode the bold;
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor had they wailed
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though the wheat had failed,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the vine no more
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gave forth her store.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, they found the waste good
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the fearless of mood.
Then to these, that were dwelling aloof from the Dale,
Fared the wild-wind a-telling the worst of the tale;
As men bathed in the morning they saw in the pool
The image of scorning, the throne of the fool.
The picture was gleaming in helm and in sword,
And shone forth its seeming from cups of the board.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forth then they came
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the battle-flame;
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Wood and the Waste
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Dale did they haste:
&nbsp;&nbsp; p.
371They saw the storm rise,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with untroubled eyes
&nbsp;&nbsp; The war-storm they met;
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the rain ruddy-wet.
O&rsquo;er the Dale then was litten the Candle of Day,
Night-sorrow was smitten, and gloom fled away.
How the grief-shackles sunder!&nbsp; How many to morn
Shall awaken and wonder how gladness was born!
O wont unto sorrow, how sweet unto you
Shall be pondering to-morrow what deed is to do!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell many a man
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Neath the edges wan,
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the heat of the play
&nbsp;&nbsp; That fashioned the day.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Praise all ye then
&nbsp;&nbsp; The death of men,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the gift of the aid
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the unafraid!
O strong are the living men mighty to save,
And good is their giving, and gifts that we have!
But the dead, they that gave us once, never again;
Long and long shall they save us sore trouble and pain.
O Banner above us, O God of the strong,
Love them as ye love us that bore down our wrong!
So they sang in the Hall; and there was many a man wept, as
the song ended, for those that should never see the good days of
the Dale, and all the joy that was to be; and men swore, by all
that they loved, that they would never forget those that had
fallen in the Winning of Silver-dale; and that when each year the
Cups of Memory went round, they should be no mere names to them,
but the very men whom they had known and loved.
p.
372CHAPTER XLIX.&nbsp; DALLACH FARETH TO ROSE-DALE: CROW
TELLETH OF HIS ERRAND: THE KINDREDS EAT THEIR MEAT IN
SILVER-DALE.
Now Dallach, who had gone away for
a while, came back again into the Hall; and at his back were a
half score of men who bore ladders with them: they were stout
men, clad in scanty and ragged raiment, but girt with swords and
bearing axes, those of them who were not handling the
ladders.&nbsp; Men looked on them curiously, because they saw
them to be of the roughest of the thralls.&nbsp; They were sullen
and fierce-eyed to behold, and their hands and bare arms were
flecked with blood; and it was easy to see that they had been
chasing the fleers, and making them pay for their many torments
of past days.
But when Face-of-god beheld this he cried out: &lsquo;Ho,
Dallach! is it so that thou hast bethought thee to bring in
hither men to fall to the cleansing of the Hall, and to do away
the defiling of the Dusky Men?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Even so, War-leader,&rsquo; said Dallach; &lsquo;also
ye shall know that all battle is over in Silver-stead; for the
thralls fell in numbers not to be endured on the Dusky Men who
had turned their backs to us, and hindered them from fleeing
north.&nbsp; But though they have slain many, they have not slain
all, and the remnant have fled by divers ways westaway, that they
may gain the wood and the ways to Rose-dale; and the stoutest of
the thralls are at their heels, and ever as they go fresh men
from the fields join in the chase with great joy.&nbsp; I have
gathered together of the best of them two hundreds and a half
well-armed; and if thou wilt give me leave, I will get to me yet
more, and follow hard on the fleers, and so get me home to
Rose-dale; for thither will these runaways to meet whatso of
their kind may be left there.&nbsp; Also I would fain be there to
set some order amongst the poor folk of mine own people, whom
this day&rsquo;s work hath delivered  span
class="pagenum">p. 373from torment.&nbsp; And if thou wilt
suffer a few men of the Dalesmen to come along with me, then
shall all things be better done there.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Luck go with thine hands!&rsquo; said
Face-of-god.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take whomso thou wilt of the Burgdalers
that have a mind to fare with thee to the number of five score;
and send word of thy thriving to Folk-might, the chieftain of the
Dale; as for us, meseemeth that we shall abide here no long
while.&nbsp; How sayest thou, Folk-might, shall Dallach
go?&rsquo;
Then Folk-might, who stood close beside him, looked up and
reddened somewhat, as a man caught heedless when he should be
heedful; but he looked kindly on Face-of-god, and said:
&lsquo;War-leader, so long as thou art in the Dale which ye
kindreds have won back for us, thou art the chieftain, and no
other, and I bid thee do as thou wilt in this matter, and in all
things; and I hereby give command to all my kindred to do
according to thy will everywhere and always, as they love me; and
indeed I deem that thy will shall be theirs; since it is only
fools who know not their well-wishers.&nbsp; How say ye,
kinsmen?&rsquo;
Then those about cried out: &lsquo;Hail to Face-of-god!&nbsp;
Hail to the Dalesmen!&nbsp; Hail to our friends!&rsquo;
But Folk-might went up to Face-of-god, and threw his arms
about him and kissed him, and he said therewithal, so that most
men heard him:
&lsquo;Herewith I kiss not only thee, thou goodly and glorious
warrior! but this kiss and embrace is for all the men of the
kindreds of the Dale and the Shepherds; since I deem that never
have men more valiant dwelt upon the earth.&rsquo;
Therewith all men shouted for joy of him, and were exceeding
glad; but Folk-might spake apart to Face-of-god and said:
&lsquo;Brother, I suppose that thou wilt deem it good to abide
in this Hall or anigh it; for hereabouts now is the heart of the
Host.&nbsp; But as for me, I would have leave to depart for a
little; since I have an errand, whereof thou mayest
wot.&rsquo;
p. 374Then
Face-of-god smiled on him, and said: &lsquo;Go, and all good go
with thee; and tell my father that I would have tidings, since I
may not be there.&rsquo;&nbsp; So he spake; yet in his heart was
he glad that he might not go to behold the Bride lying sick and
sorry.&nbsp; But Folk-might departed without more words; and in
the door of the Hall he met Crow the Shaft-speeder, who would
have spoken to him, and given him the tidings; but Folk-might
said to him: &lsquo;Do thine errand to the War-leader, who is
within the Hall.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so went on his way.
Then came Crow up the Hall, and stood before Face-of-god and
said: &lsquo;War-leader, we have done that which was to be done,
and have cleared all the houses about the Market-stead.&nbsp;
Moreover, by the rede of Dallach we have set certain men of the
poor folk of the Dale, who are well looked to by the others, to
the burying of the slain felons; and they be digging trenches in
the fields on the north side of the Market-stead, and carry the
carcasses thither as they may.&nbsp; But the slain whom they find
of the kindreds do they array out yonder before this Hall.&nbsp;
In all wise are these men tame and biddable, save that they rage
against the Dusky Men, though they fear them yet.&nbsp; As for
us, they deem us Gods come down from heaven to help them.&nbsp;
So much for what is good: now have I an ill word to say; to wit,
that in the houses whereas we have found many thralls alive, yet
also have we found many dead; for amongst these murder-carles
were some of an evil sort, who, when they saw that the battle
would go against them, rushed into the houses hewing down all
before them&mdash;man, woman, and child; so that many of the
halls and chambers we saw running blood like to shambles.&nbsp;
To be short: of them whom they were going to hew to the Gods, we
have found thirteen living and three dead, of which latter is one
woman; and of the living, seven women; and all these, living and
dead, with the leaden shackles yet on them wherein they should be
burned.&nbsp; To all these and others whom we have found, we have
done what of service we could in the way of  a
name="page375">p. 375victual and
clothes, so that they scarce believe that they are on this lower
earth.&nbsp; Moreover, I have with me two score of them, who are
men of some wits, and who know of the stores of victual and other
wares which the felons had, and these will fetch and carry for
you as much as ye will.&nbsp; Is all done rightly,
War-leader?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Right well,&rsquo; said Face-of-god, &lsquo;and we give
thee our thanks therefor.&nbsp; And now it were well if these thy
folk were to dight our dinner for us in some green field the
nighest that may be, and thither shall all the Host be bidden by
sound of horn.&nbsp; Meantime, let us void this Hall till it be
cleansed of the filth of the Dusky Ones; but hereafter shall we
come again to it, and light a fire on the Holy Hearth, and bid
the Gods and the Fathers come back and behold their children
sitting glad in the ancient Hall.&rsquo;
Then men shouted and were exceeding joyous; but Face-of-god
said once more: &lsquo;Bear ye a bench out into the Market-place
over against the door of this Hall: thereon will I sit with other
chieftains of the kindreds, that whoso will may have recourse to
us.&rsquo;
So therewith all the men of the kindreds made their ways out
of the Hall and into the Market-stead, which was by this time
much cleared of the slaughtered felons; and the bale for the
burnt-offering was now but smouldering, and a thin column of blue
smoke was going up wavering amidst the light airs of the
afternoon.&nbsp; Men were somewhat silent now; for they were
stiff and weary with the morning&rsquo;s battle; and a many had
been hurt withal; and on many there yet rested the after-grief of
battle, and sorrow for the loss of friends and well-wishers.
For in the battle had fallen one long hundred and two of the
men of the Host; and of these were two score and five of the
kindreds of the Steer, the Bull, and the Bridge, who had made
such valiant onslaught by the southern road.&nbsp; Of the
Shepherds died one score save three; for though they scattered
the foe at once, yet they fell on with such headlong valour,
rather than wisely, that many were trapped in the throng of the
Dusky Men.&nbsp; p.
376Of the Woodlanders were slain one score and nine; for
hard had been the fight about them, and no man of them spared
himself one whit.&nbsp; Of the men of the Wolf, who were but a
few, fell sixteen men, and all save two of these in
Face-of-god&rsquo;s battle.&nbsp; Of the Burgdale men whom
Folk-might led, to wit, them of the Face, the Vine, and the
Sickle, were but seven men slain outright.&nbsp; In this tale are
told all those who died of their hurts after the day of
battle.&nbsp; Therewithal many others were sorely hurt who
mended, and went about afterwards hale and hearty.
So as the folk abode in the Market-place, somewhat faint and
weary, they heard horns blow up merrily, and Crow the
Shaft-speeder came forth and stood on the mound of the altar, and
bade men fare to dinner, and therewith he led the way, bearing in
his hand the banner of the Golden Bushel, of which House he was;
and they followed him into a fair and great mead on the southwest
of Silver-stead, besprinkled about with ancient trees of sweet
chestnut.&nbsp; There they found the boards spread for them with
the best of victual which the poor down-trodden folk knew how to
dight for them; and especially was there great plenty of good
wine of the sun-smitten bents.
So they fell to their meat, and the poor folk, both men and
women, served them gladly, though they were somewhat afeard of
these fierce sword-wielders, the Gods who had delivered
them.&nbsp; The said thralls were mostly not of those who had
fallen so bitterly on their fleeing masters, but were men and
women of the households, not so roughly treated as the others,
that is to say, those who had been wont to toil under the lash in
the fields and the silver-mines, and were as wild as they durst
be.
As for these waiting-thralls, the men of the kindreds were
gentle and blithe with them, and often as they served them would
they stay their hands (and especially if they were women), and
would draw down their heads to put a morsel in their mouths, or
set the wine-cup to their lips; and they would stroke them and
caress them, and treat them in all wise as their dear
friends.&nbsp; Moreover,  span
class="pagenum">p. 377when any man was full, he would
arise and take hold of one of the thralls, and set him in his
place, and serve him with meat and drink, and talk with him
kindly, so that the poor folk were much bewildered with
joy.&nbsp; And the first that arose from table were the Sun-beam
and Bow-may and Hall-face, with many of the swains and the women
of the Woodlanders; and they went from table to table serving the
others.
The Sun-beam had done off her armour, and went about exceeding
fair and lovely in her kirtle; but Bow-may yet bore her hauberk,
for she loved it, and indeed it was so fine and well-wrought that
it was no great burden.&nbsp; Albeit she had gone down with the
Sun-beam and other women to a fair stream thereby, and there had
they bathed and washed themselves; and Bow-may&rsquo;s hurts,
which were not great, had been looked to and bound up afresh, and
she had come to table unhelmed, with a wreath of wind-flowers
round her head.
There then they feasted; and their hearts were strengthened by
the meat and drink; and if sorrow were blended with their joy,
yet were they high-hearted through both joy and sorrow, looking
forward to the good days to be in the Dales at the Roots of the
Mountains, and the love and fellowship of Folks and of
Houses.
But as for Face-of-god, he went not to the meadow, but abode
sitting on the bench in the Market-place, where were none else
now of the kindreds save the appointed warders.&nbsp; They had
brought him a morsel and a cup of wine, and he had eaten and
drunk; and now he sat there with Dale-warden lying sheathed
across his knees, and seeming to gaze on the thralls of
Silver-dale busied in carrying away the bodies of the slain
felons, after they had stripped them of their raiment and
weapons.&nbsp; Yet indeed all this was before his eyes as a
picture which he noted not.&nbsp; Rather he sat pondering many
things; wondering at his being there in Silver-dale in the hour
of victory; longing for the peace of Burgdale and the
bride-chamber of the Sun-beam.&nbsp; Then went his thought out
toward his old playmate lying hurt in Silver-dale;  a
name="page378">p. 378and his
heart was grieved because of her, yet not for long, though his
thought still dwelt on her; since he deemed that she would live
and presently be happy&mdash;and happy thenceforward for many
years.&nbsp; So pondered Face-of-god in the Market-place of
Silver-dale.
CHAPTER L.&nbsp; FOLK-MIGHT SEETH THE BRIDE AND SPEAKETH WITH
HER.
Now tells the tale of Folk-might,
that he went his ways from the Hall to the house where the Bride
lay; and the swain who had brought the message went along with
him, and he was proud of walking beside so mighty a warrior, and
he talked to Folk-might as they went; and the sound of his voice
was irksome to the chieftain, but he made as though he
hearkened.&nbsp; Yet when they came to the door of the house,
which was just out of the Place on the Southern road (for thereby
had the Bride fallen to earth), he could withhold his grief no
longer, but turned on the threshold and laid his head on the
door-jamb, and sobbed and wept till the tears fell down like
rain.&nbsp; And the boy stood by wondering, and wishing that
Folk-might would forbear weeping, but durst not speak to him.
In a while Folk-might left weeping and went in, and found a
fair hall sore befouled by the felons, and in the corner on a bed
covered with furs the wounded woman; and at first sight he deemed
her not so pale as he looked to see her, as she lay with her long
dark-red hair strewed over the pillow, her head moving about
wearily.&nbsp; A linen cloth was thrown over her body, but her
arms lay out of it before her.&nbsp; Beside her sat the Alderman,
his face sober enough, but not as one in heavy sorrow; and anigh
him was another chair as if someone had but just got up from
it.&nbsp; There was no one else in the hall save two women of the
Woodlanders, one of whom was cooking some potion on the hearth,
and p.
379another was sweeping the floor anigh of bran or some
such stuff, which had been thrown down to sop up the blood.
So Folk-might went up to the Bride, sorely dreading the image
of death which she had grown to be, and sorely loving the woman
she was and would be.
He knelt down by the bedside, heeding Iron-face little, though
he nodded friendly to him, and he held his face close to hers;
but she had her eyes shut and did not open them till he had been
there a little while; and then they opened and fixed themselves
on his without surprise or change.&nbsp; Then she lifted her
right hand (for it was in her left shoulder and side that she had
been hurt) and slowly laid it on his head, and drew his face to
hers and kissed it fondly, as she both smiled and let the tears
run over from her eyes.&nbsp; Then she spake in a weak voice:
&lsquo;Thou seest, chieftain and dear friend, that I may not
stand by thy victorious side to-day.&nbsp; And now, though I were
fain if thou wouldst never leave me, yet needs must thou go about
thy work, since thou art become the Alderman of the Folk of
Silver-dale.&nbsp; Yea, and even if thou wert not to go from me,
yet in a manner should I go from thee.&nbsp; For I am grievously
hurt, and I know by myself, and also the leeches have told me,
that the fever is a-coming on me; so that presently I shall not
know thee, but may deem thee to be a woman, or a hound, or the
very Wolf that is the image of the Father of thy kindred; or
even, it may be, someone else&mdash;that I have played with time
agone.&rsquo;
Her voice faltered and faded out here, and she was silent a
while; then she said:
&lsquo;So depart, kind friend and dear love, bearing this word
with thee, that should I die, I call on Iron-face my kinsman to
bear witness that I bid thee carry me to bale in Silver-dale, and
lay mine ashes with the ashes of thy Fathers, with whom thine own
shall mingle at the last, since I have been of the warriors who
have helped to bring thee aback to the land of thy
folk.&rsquo;
Then she smiled and shut her eyes and said: &lsquo;And if I
live, p. 380as
indeed I hope, and how glad and glad I shall be to live, then
shalt thou bring me to thy house and thy bed, that I may not
depart from thee while both our lives last.&rsquo;
And she opened her eyes and looked at him; and he might not
speak for a while, so ravished as he was betwixt joy and
sorrow.&nbsp; But the Alderman arose and took a gold ring from
off his arm, and spake:
&lsquo;This is the gold ring of the God of the Face, and I
bear it on mine arm betwixt the Folk and the God in all
man-motes, and I bore it through the battle to-day; and it is as
holy a ring as may be; and since ye are plighting troth, and I am
the witness thereof, it were good that ye held this ring together
and called the God to witness, who is akin to the God of the
Earth, as we all be.&nbsp; Take the ring, Folk-might, for I trust
thee; and of all women now alive would I have this woman
happy.&rsquo;
So Folk-might took the ring and thrust his hand through it,
and took her hand, and said:
&lsquo;Ye Fathers, thou God of the Face, thou Earth-god, thou
Warrior, bear witness that my life and my body are plighted to
this woman, the Bride of the House of the Steer!&rsquo;
His face was flushed and bright as he spoke, but as his words
ceased he noted how feebly her hand lay in his, and his face
fell, and he gazed on her timidly.&nbsp; But she lay quiet, and
said softly and slowly:
&lsquo;O Fathers of my kindred!&nbsp; O Warrior and God of the
Earth! bear witness that I plight my troth to this man, to lie in
his grave if I die, and in his bed if I live.&rsquo;
And she smiled on him again, and then closed her eyes; but
opened them presently once more, and said:
&lsquo;Dear friend, how fared it with Gold-mane
to-day?&rsquo;
Said Folk-might: &lsquo;So well he did, that none might have
done better.&nbsp; He fared in the fight as if he had been our
Father the Warrior: he is a great chieftain.&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;Wilt thou give him this message from me, that
in p. 381no
wise he forget the oath which he swore upon the finger-ring as it
lay on the sundial of the Garden of the Face?&nbsp; And say,
moreover, that I am sorry that we shall part, and have between us
such breadth of wild-wood and mountain-neck.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, surely will I give thy message,&rsquo; said
Folk-might; and in his heart he rejoiced, because he heard her
speak as if she were sure of life.&nbsp; Then she said
faintly:
&lsquo;It is now thy work to depart from me, and to do as it
behoveth a chieftain of the people and the Alderman of
Silver-dale.&nbsp; Depart, lest the leeches chide me: farewell,
my dear!&rsquo;
So he laid his face to hers and kissed her, and rose up and
embraced Iron-face, and went his ways without looking back.
But just over the threshold he met old Hall-ward of the House
of the Steer, who was at point to enter, and he greeted him
kindly.&nbsp; The old man looked on him steadily, and said:
&lsquo;To-morrow or the day after I will utter a word to thee, O
Chief of the Wolf.&rsquo;
&lsquo;In a good hour,&rsquo; said Folk-might, &lsquo;for all
thy words are true.&rsquo;&nbsp; Therewith he gat him away from
the house, and came to Face-of-god, where he sat before the altar
of the Crooked Sword; and now were the chiefs come back from
their meat, and were sitting with him; there also were
Wood-father and Wood-wont; but Bow-may was with the Sun-beam, who
was resting softly in the fair meadow after all the turmoil.
So men made place for Folk-might beside the War-leader, who
looked upon his face, and saw that it was sober and unsmiling,
but not heavy or moody with grief.&nbsp; So he deemed that all
was as well as it might be with the Bride, and with a good heart
fell to taking counsel with the others; and kindly and friendly
were the redes which they held there, with no gainsaying of man
by man, for the whole folk was glad at heart.
So there they ordered all matters duly for that present time,
and by then they had made an end, it was past sunset, and men
were lodged in the chief houses about the Market-stead.
Albeit, though they ate their meat with all joy of heart, and
p. 382were
merry in converse one with the other, the men of the Wolf would
by no means feast in their Hall again till it had been cleansed
and hallowed anew.
CHAPTER LI.&nbsp; THE DEAD BORNE TO BALE: THE MOTE-HOUSE
RE-HALLOWED.
On the morrow they bore to bale
their slain men, and there withal what was left of the bodies of
the four chieftains of the Great Undoing.&nbsp; They brought them
into a most fair meadow to the west of Silver-stead, where they
had piled up a very great bale for the burning.&nbsp; In that
meadow was the Doom-ring and Thing-stead of the Folk of the Wolf,
and they had hallowed it when they had first conquered
Silver-dale, and it was deemed far holier than the Mote-house
aforesaid, wherein the men of the kindred might hold no due
court; but rather it was a Feast-hall, and a house where men had
converse together, and wherein precious things and tokens of the
Fathers were stored up.
The Thing-stead in the meadow was flowery and well-grassed,
and a little stream winding about thereby nearly cast a ring
around it; and beyond the stream was a full fair grove of
oak-trees, very tall and ancient.&nbsp; There then they burned
the dead of the Host, wrapped about in exceeding fair
raiment.&nbsp; And when the ashes were gathered, the men of
Burgdale and the Shepherds left those of their folk for the
kindred to bury there in Silver-dale; for they said that they had
a right to claim such guesting for them that had helped to win
back the Dale.
But when the Burning was done and the bale quenched, and the
ashes gathered and buried (and that was on the morrow), then men
bore forth the Banners of the Jaws of the Wolf, and the Red Hand,
and the Silver Arm, and the Golden Bushel, and the Ragged Sword,
and the Wolf of the Woodland; and with great joy and  a
name="page383">p. 383triumph
they brought them into the Mote-house and hung them up over the
da&iuml;s; and they kindled fire on the Holy Hearth by holding up
a disk of bright glass to the sun; and then they sang before the
banners.&nbsp; And this is somewhat of the song that they sang
before them:
Why are ye wending?&nbsp; O whence and
whither?
&nbsp;&nbsp; What shineth over the fallow swords?
What is the joy that ye bear in hither?
&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the tale of your blended words?
No whither we wend, but here have we stayed
us,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here by the ancient Holy Hearth;
Long have the moons and the years delayed us,
&nbsp;&nbsp; But here are we come from the heart of the
dearth.
We are the men of joy belated;
&nbsp;&nbsp; We are the wanderers over the waste;
We are but they that sat and waited,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Watching the empty winds make haste.
Long, long we sat and knew no others,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Save alien folk and the foes of the road;
Till late and at last we met our brothers,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And needs must we to the old abode.
For once on a day they prayed for guesting; br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And how were we then their bede to do?
Wild was the waste for the people&rsquo;s resting,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And deep the wealth of the Dale we knew.
Here were the boards that we must spread
them
&nbsp;&nbsp; Down in the fruitful Dale and dear;
Here were the halls where we would bed them:
&nbsp;&nbsp; And how should we tarry otherwhere?
p.
384Over the waste we came together:
&nbsp;&nbsp; There was the tangle athwart the way;
There was the wind-storm and the weather;
&nbsp;&nbsp; The red rain darkened down the day.
But that day of the days what grief should let
us,
&nbsp;&nbsp; When we saw through the clouds the dale-glad sun? br
/>
We tore at the tangle that beset us,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stood at peace when the day was done.
Hall of the Happy, take our greeting!
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bid thou the Fathers come and see
The Folk-signs on thy walls a-meeting,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And deem to-day what men we be.
Look on the Holy Hearth new-litten,
&nbsp;&nbsp; How the sparks fly twinkling up aloof!
How the wavering smoke by the sunlight smitten,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Curls up around the beam-rich roof!
For here once more is the Wolf abiding,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor ever more from the Dale shall wend,
And never again his head be hiding,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till all days be dark and the world have end.
CHAPTER LII.&nbsp; OF THE NEW BEGINNING OF GOOD DAYS IN
SILVER-DALE.
On the third day there was
high-tide and great joy amongst all men from end to end of the
Dale; and the delivered thralls were feasted and made much of by
the kindreds, so that they scarce knew how to believe their own
five senses that told them the good tidings.
For none strove to grieve them and torment them; what they  a
name="page385">p. 385would, that
did they, and they had all things plenteously; since for all was
there enough and to spare of goods stored up for the Dusky Men,
as corn and wine and oil and spices, and raiment and
silver.&nbsp; Horses were there also, and neat and sheep and
swine in abundance.&nbsp; Withal there was the good and dear
land; the waxing corn on the acres; the blossoming vines on the
hillside; and about the orchards and alongside the ways, the
plum-trees and cherry-trees and pear-trees that had cast their
blossom and were overhung with little young fruit; and the fair
apple-trees a-blossoming, and the chestnuts spreading their
boughs from their twisted trunks over the green grass.&nbsp; And
there was the goodly pasture for the horses and the neat, and the
thymy hill-grass for the sheep; and beyond it all, the thicket of
the great wood, with its unfailing store of goodly timber of ash
and oak and holly and yoke-elm.&nbsp; There need no man lack
unless man compelled him, and all was rich enough and wide enough
for the waxing of a very great folk.
Now, therefore, men betook them to what was their own before
the coming of the Dusky Men; and though at first many of the
delivered thrall-folk feasted somewhat above measure, and though
there were some of them who were not very brisk at working on the
earth for their livelihood; yet were the most part of them quick
of wit and deft of hand, and they mostly fell to presently at
their cunning, both of husbandry and handicraft.&nbsp; Moreover,
they had great love of the kindreds, and especially of the
Woodlanders, and strove to do all things that might pleasure
them.&nbsp; And as for those who were dull and listless because
of their many torments of the last ten years, they would at least
fetch and carry willingly for them of the kindreds; and these
last grudged them not meat and raiment and house-room, even if
they wrought but little for it, because they called to mind the
evil days of their thralldom, and bethought them how few are
men&rsquo;s days upon the earth.
Thus all things throve in Silver-dale, and the days wore on  a
name="page386">p. 386toward the
summer, and the Yule-tide rest beyond it, and the years beyond
and far beyond the winning of Silver-dale.
CHAPTER LIII.&nbsp; OF THE WORD WHICH HALL-WARD OF THE STEER
HAD FOR FOLK-MIGHT.
But of the time then passing, it is
to be said that the whole host abode in Silver-dale in great
mirth and good liking, till they should hear tidings of Dallach
and his company, who had followed hot-foot on the fleers of the
Dusky Men.&nbsp; And on the tenth day after the battle, Iron-face
and his two sons and Stone-face were sitting about sunset under a
great oak-tree by that stream-side which ran through the
Mote-stead; there also was Folk-might, somewhat distraught
because of his love for the Bride, who was now mending of her
hurts.&nbsp; As they sat there in all content they saw folk
coming toward them, three in number, and as they drew nigher they
saw that it was old Hall-ward of the Steer, and the Sun-beam and
Bow-may following him hand in hand.
When they came to the brook Bow-may ran up to the elder to
help him over the stepping-stones; which she did as one who loved
him, as the old man was stark enough to have waded the water
waist-deep.&nbsp; She was no longer in her war-gear, but was clad
after her wont of Shadowy Vale, in nought but a white woollen
kirtle.&nbsp; So she stood in the stream beside the stones, and
let the swift water ripple up over her ankles, while the elder
leaned on her shoulder and looked down upon her kindly.&nbsp; The
Sun-beam followed after them, stepping daintily from stone to
stone, so that she was a fair sight to see; her face was smiling
and happy, and as she stepped forth on to the green grass the
colour flushed up in it, but she cast her eyes adown as one
somewhat shamefaced.
So the chieftains rose up before the leader of the Steer, and
p.
387Folk-might went up to him, and greeted him, and took
his hand and kissed him on the cheek.&nbsp; And Hall-ward
said:
&lsquo;Hail to the chiefs of the kindred, and my earthly
friends!&rsquo;
Then Folk-might bade him sit down by him, and all the men sat
down again; but the Sun-beam leaned her back against a sapling
ash hard by, her feet set close together; and Bow-may went to and
fro in short turns, keeping well within ear-shot.
Then said Hall-ward: &lsquo;Folk-might, I have prayed thy
kinswoman Bow-may to lead me to thee, that I might speak with
thee; and it is good that I find my kinsmen of the Face in thy
company; for I would say a word to thee that concerns them
somewhat.&rsquo;
Said Folk-might: &lsquo;Guest, and warrior of the Steer, thy
words are ever good; and if this time thou comest to ask aught of
me, then shall they be better than good.&rsquo;
Said Hall-ward: &lsquo;Tell me, Folk-might, hast thou seen my
daughter the Bride to-day?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said Folk-might, reddening.
&lsquo;What didst thou deem of her state?&rsquo; said
Hall-ward.
Said Folk-might: &lsquo;Thou knowest thyself that the fever
hath left her, and that she is mending.&rsquo;
Hall-ward said: &lsquo;In a few days belike we shall be
wending home to Burgdale: when deemest thou that the Bride may
travel, if it were but on a litter?&rsquo;
Folk-might was silent, and Hall-ward smiled on him and
said:
&lsquo;Wouldst thou have her tarry, O chief of the
Wolf?&rsquo;
&lsquo;So it is,&rsquo; said Folk-might, &lsquo;that it might
be labour lost for her to journey to Burgdale at
present.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Thinkest thou?&rsquo; said Hall-ward; &lsquo;hast thou
a mind then that if she goeth she shall speedily come back
hither?&rsquo;
&lsquo;It has been in my mind,&rsquo; said Folk-might,
&lsquo;that I should wed her.&nbsp; Wilt thou gainsay it?&nbsp; I
pray thee, Iron-face my friend, and ye Stone-face and Hall-face,
and thou, Face-of-god, my brother, to lay thy words to mine in
this matter.&rsquo;
p. 388Then
said Hall-ward stroking his beard: &lsquo;There will be a seat
missing in the Hall of the Steer, and a sore lack in the heart of
many a man in Burgdale if the Bride come back to us no
more.&nbsp; We looked not to lose the maiden by her wedding; for
it is no long way betwixt the House of the Steer and the House of
the Face.&nbsp; But now, when I arise in the morning and miss
her, I shall take my staff and walk down the street of Burgstead;
for I shall say, The Maiden hath gone to see Iron-face my friend;
she is well in the House of the Face.&nbsp; And then shall I
remember how that the wood and the wastes lie between us.&nbsp;
How sayest thou, Alderman?&rsquo;
&lsquo;A sore lack it will be,&rsquo; said Iron-face;
&lsquo;but all good go with her!&nbsp; Though whiles shall I go
hatless down Burgstead street, and say, Now will I go fetch my
daughter the Bride from the House of the Steer; while many a
day&rsquo;s journey shall lie betwixt us.&rsquo;
Said Hall-ward: &lsquo;I will not beat about the bush,
Folk-might; what gift wilt thou give us for the
maiden?&rsquo;
Said Folk-might: &lsquo;Whatever is mine shall be thine; and
whatsoever of the Dale the kindred and the poor folk begrudge
thee not, that shalt thou have; and deemest thou that they will
begrudge thee aught?&nbsp; Is it enough?&rsquo;
Hall-ward said: &lsquo;I wot not, chieftain; see thou to
it!&nbsp; Bow-may, my friend, bring hither that which I would
have from Silver-dale for the House of the Steer in payment for
our maiden.&rsquo;
Then Bow-may came forward speedily, and went up to the
Sun-beam, and led her by the hand in front of Folk-might and
Hall-ward and the other chieftains.&nbsp; Then Folk-might
started, and leapt up from the ground; for, sooth to say, he had
been thinking so wholly of the Bride, that his sister was not in
his mind, and he had had no deeming of whither Hall-ward was
coming, though the others guessed well enough, and now smiled on
him merrily, when they saw how wild Folk-might stared.&nbsp;  a
name="page389">p. 389As for the
Sun-beam, she stood there blushing like a rose in June, but
looking her brother straight in the face, as Hall-ward said:
&lsquo;Folk-might, chief of the Wolf, since thou wouldst take
our maiden the Bride away from us, I ask thee to make good her
place with this maiden; so that the House of the Steer may not
lack, when they who are wont to wed therein come to us and pray
us for a bedfellow for the best of their kindred.&rsquo;
Then became Folk-might smiling and merry like unto the others,
and he said: &lsquo;Chief of the Steer, this gift is thine,
together with aught else which thou mayst desire of
us.&rsquo;
Then he kissed the Sun-beam, and said: &lsquo;Sister, we
looked for this to befall in some fashion.&nbsp; Yet we deemed
that he that should lead thee away might abide with us for a moon
or two.&nbsp; But now let all this be, since if thou art not to
bear children to the kindreds of Silver-dale, yet shalt thou bear
them to their friends and fellows.&nbsp; And now choose what gift
thou wilt have of us to keep us in thy memory.&rsquo;
She said: &lsquo;The memory of my people shall not fade from
me; yet indeed I ask thee for a gift, to wit, Bow-may, and the
two sons of Wood-father that are left since Wood-wicked was
slain; and belike the elder and his wife will be fain to go with
their sons, and ye will not hinder them.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Even so shall it be done,&rsquo; said Folk-might, and
he was silent a while, pondering; and then he said:
&lsquo;Lo you, friends! doth it not seem strange to you that
peace sundereth as well as war?&nbsp; Indeed I deem it grievous
that ye shall have to miss your well-beloved kinswoman.&nbsp; And
for me, I am now grown so used to this woman my sister, though at
whiles she hath been masterful with me, that I shall often turn
about and think to speak to her, when there lie long days of wood
and waste betwixt her voice and mine.
The Sun-beam laughed in his face, though the tears stood in
her eyes, as she said: &lsquo;Keep up thine heart, brother; for
at least p.
390the way is shorter betwixt Burgdale and Silver-dale
than betwixt life and death; and the road we shall learn
belike.&rsquo;
Said Hall-face: &lsquo;So it is that my brother is no ill
woodman, as ye learned last autumn.&rsquo;
Iron-face smiled, but somewhat sadly; for he beheld
Face-of-god, who had no eyes for anyone save the Sun-beam; and no
marvel was that, for never had she looked fairer.&nbsp; And
forsooth the War-leader was not utterly well-pleased; for he was
deeming that there would be delaying of his wedding, now that the
Sun-beam was to become a maid of the Steer; and in his mind he
half deemed that it would be better if he were to take her by the
hand and lead her home through the wild-wood, he and she alone;
and she looked on him shyly, as though she had a deeming of his
thought.&nbsp; Albeit he knew it might not be, that he, the
chosen War-leader, should trouble the peace of the kindred; for
he wotted that all this was done for peace&rsquo; sake.
So Hall-ward stood forth and took the Sun-beam&rsquo;s right
hand in his, and said:
&lsquo;Now do I take this maiden, Sun-beam of the kindred of
the Wolf, and lead her into the House of the Steer, to be in all
ways one of the maidens of our House, and to wed in the blood
wherein we have been wont to wed.&nbsp; Neither from henceforth
let anyone say that this woman is not of the blood of the Steer;
for we have given her our blood, and she is of us duly and
truly.&rsquo;
Thereafter they talked together merrily for a little, and then
turned toward the houses, for the sun was now down; and as they
went Iron-face spake to his son, and said:
&lsquo;Gold-mane, wilt thou verily keep thine oath to wed the
fairest woman in the world?&nbsp; By how much is this one fairer
than my dear daughter who shall no more dwell in mine
house?&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;Yea, father, I shall keep mine oath;
for the Gods, who know much, know that when I swore last Yule I
was thinking of the fair woman going yonder beside Hall-ward, and
of none other.&rsquo;
p.
391&lsquo;Ah, son!&rsquo; said Iron-face, &lsquo;why didst
thou beguile us?&nbsp; Hadst thou but told us the truth
then!&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, Alderman,&rsquo; said Face-of-god smiling,
&lsquo;and how thou wouldest have raged against me then, when
thou hast scarce forgiven me now!&nbsp; In sooth, father, I
feared to tell you all: I was young; I was one against the
world.&nbsp; Yea, yea; and even that was sweet to me, so sorely
as I loved her&mdash;Hast thou forgotten, father?&rsquo;
Iron-face smiled, and answered not; and so came they to the
house wherein they were guested.
CHAPTER LIV.&nbsp; TIDINGS OF DALLACH: A FOLK-MOTE IN
SILVER-DALE.
Three days thereafter came two
swift runners from Rose-dale with tidings of Dallach.&nbsp; In
all wise had he thriven, and had slain many of the runaways, and
had come happily to Rose-dale: therein by the mere shaking of
their swords had they all their will; for there were but a few of
the Dusky Warriors in the Dale, since the more part had fared to
the slaughter in Silver-stead.&nbsp; Now therefore had Dallach
been made Alderman of Rose-dale; and the Burgdalers who had gone
with him should abide the coming thither of the rest of the
Burgdale Host, and meantime of their coming should uphold the new
Alderman in Rose-dale.&nbsp; Howbeit Dallach sent word that it
was not to be doubted but that many of the Dusky Men had escaped
to the woods, and should yet be the death of many a
mother&rsquo;s son, unless it were well looked to.
And now the more part of the Burgdale men and the Shepherds
began to look toward home, albeit some amongst them had not been
ill-pleased to abide there yet a while; for life was exceeding
soft to them there, though they helped the poor folk gladly in
their husbandry.&nbsp; For especially the women of the Dale,  a
name="page392">p. 392of whom
many were very goodly, hankered after the fair-faced tall
Burgdalers, and were as kind to them as might be.&nbsp; Forsooth
not a few, both carles and queens, of the old thrall-folk prayed
them of Burgdale to take them home thither, that they might see
new things and forget their old torments once for all, yea, even
in dreams.&nbsp; The Burgdalers would not gainsay them, and there
was no one else to hinder; so that there went with the Burgdale
men at their departure hard on five score of the Silver-dale folk
who were not of the kindreds.
And now was a great Folk-mote holden in Silver-dale, whereto
the Burgdale men and the Shepherds were bidden; and thereat the
War-leader gave out the morrow of the morrow for the day of the
departure of the Host.&nbsp; There also were the matters of
Silver-dale duly ordered: the Men of the Wolf would have had the
Woodlanders dwell with them in the fair-builded stead, and take
to them of the goodly stone houses there what they would; but
this they naysaid, choosing rather to dwell in scattered houses,
which they built for themselves at the utmost limit of the
tillage.
Indeed, the most abode not even there a long while; for they
loved the wood and its deeds.&nbsp; So they went forth into the
wood, and cleared them space to dwell in, and builded them halls
such as they loved, and fell to their old woodland crafts of
charcoal-burning and hunting, wherein they throve well.&nbsp; And
good for Silver-dale was their abiding there, since they became a
sure defence and stout outpost against all foemen.&nbsp; For the
rest, wheresoever they dwelt, they were guest-cherishing and
blithe, and were well beloved by all people; and they wedded with
the other Houses of the Children of the Wolf.
As to the other matters whereof they took rede at this
Folk-mote, they had mostly to do with the warding of the Dale,
and the learning of the delivered thralls to handle weapons
duly.&nbsp; For men deemed it most like that they would have to
meet other men of the kindred of the Felons; which indeed fell
out as the years wore.
p.
393Moreover, Folk-might (by the rede of Stone-face) sent
messengers to the Plain and the Cities, unto men whom he knew
there, doing them to wit of the tidings of Silver-dale, and how
that a peaceful and guest-loving people, having good store of
wares, now dwelt therein, so that chapmen might have recourse
thither.
Lastly spake Folk-might and said:
&lsquo;Guests and brothers-in-arms, we have been looking about
our new house, which was our old one, and therein we find great
store of wares which we need not, and which we can but use if ye
use them.&nbsp; Of your kindness therefore we pray you to take of
those things what ye can easily carry.&nbsp; And if ye say the
way is long, as indeed it is, since ye are bent on going through
the wood to Rose-dale, and so on to Burgdale, yet shall we
furnish you with beasts to bear your goods, and with such wains
as may pass through the woodland ways.&rsquo;
Then rose up Fox of Upton and said: &lsquo;O Folk-might, and
ye men of the Wolf, be it known unto you, that if we have done
anything for your help in the winning of Silver-dale, we have
thus done that we might help ourselves also, so that we might
live in peace henceforward, and that we might have your
friendship and fellowship therewithal, so that here in
Silver-dale might wax a mighty folk who joined unto us should be
strong enough to face the whole world.&nbsp; Such are the redes
of wise men when they go a-warring.&nbsp; But we have no will to
go back home again made rich with your wealth; this hath been far
from our thought in this matter.&rsquo;
And there went up a murmur from all the Burgdalers yeasaying
his word.
But Folk-might took up the word again and spake:
&lsquo;Men of Burgdale and the Sheepcotes, what ye say is both
manly and friendly; yet, since we look to see a road made plain
through the woodland betwixt Burgdale and Silver-dale, and that
often ye shall face us in the feast-hall, and whiles stand beside
us in the fray, we must needs pray you not to shame us  a
name="page394">p. 394by
departing empty-handed; for how then may we look upon your faces
again?&nbsp; Stone-face, my friend, thou art old and wise;
therefore I bid thee to help us herein, and speak for us to thy
kindred, that they naysay us not in this matter.&rsquo;
Then stood up Stone-face and said: &lsquo;Forsooth, friends,
Folk-might is in the right herein; for he may look for anger from
the wights that come and go betwixt his kindred and the Gods, if
they see us faring back giftless through the woods.&nbsp;
Moreover, now that ye have seen Silver-dale, ye may wot how rich
a land it is of all good things, and able to bring forth enough
and to spare.&nbsp; And now meseemeth the Gods love this Folk
that shall dwell here; and they shall become a mighty Folk, and a
part of our very selves.&nbsp; Therefore let us take the gifts of
our friends, and thank them blithely.&nbsp; For surely, as saith
Folk-might, henceforth the wood shall become a road betwixt us,
and the thicket a halting-place for friends bearing goodwill in
their hands.&rsquo;
When he had spoken, men yeasaid his words and forbore the
gifts no longer; and the Folk-mote sundered in all
loving-kindness.
CHAPTER LV.&nbsp; DEPARTURE FROM SILVER-DALE.
On morrow of the morrow were the
Burgdale men and they of the Shepherds gathered together in the
Market-stead early in the morning, and they were all ready for
departure; and the men of the Wolf and the Woodlanders, and of
the delivered thralls a great many, stood round about them
grieving that they must go.&nbsp; There was much talk between the
folk of the Dale and the Guests, and many promises were given and
taken to come and go betwixt the two Dales.&nbsp; There also were
the men of the thrall-folk who were to wend home with the
Burgdalers; and they had been stuffed with good things by the men
of the kindreds, and were as fain as might be.
p. 395As
for the Sun-beam, she was somewhat out of herself at first, being
eager and restless beyond her wont, and yet at whiles
weeping-ripe when she called to mind that she was now leaving all
those things, the gain whereof had been a dream to her both
waking and sleeping for these years past.&nbsp; But at last, as
she stood in the door of the Mote-house, and beheld all the
throng of folk happy and friendly, it came over her that she
herself had done her full share to bring all this about, and that
all those pleasant places of Silver-dale now full of the goodly
life of man would be there even as she had striven for them, and
that they would be a part of her left behind, though she were
dwelling otherwhere.
Therewithal she said to herself that it was now her part to
wield the life of men in Burgdale, and begin once more her days
of a chieftain and a swayer of the Folk, and the life of a
stirring woman, which the edge of the sword and the need of the
hard hand-play had taken out of her hands for a while, making her
as a child in the hands of the strong wielders of the blades.
So now she became calm once more, and her face was clad again
with the full measure of that majesty of beauty which had once
overawed Face-of-god amidst his love of her; and folk beheld her
and marvelled at her fairness, and said: &lsquo;She hath an
inward sorrow at leaving the fair Dale wherein her Fathers dwelt,
and where her mother&rsquo;s ashes lie in earth.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Albeit now was her sorrow but little, and much was her hope, and
her foresight of days to be; though all the Dale, yea, every leaf
and twig of it whereby her feet had ever passed, and each stone
of the fair houses, was to her as a picture that she could look
on from henceforth for ever.
Of the Bride it is to be said that she was now much mended,
and she caused men bear her on a litter out into the Marketplace,
that she might look on the departure of her folk.&nbsp; She had
seen Face-of-god once and again since the Day of Battle, and each
time had been kind and blithe with him; and for Iron-face,  a
name="page396">p. 396she loved
him so well that she was ever loth to let him depart from her,
save when Folk-might was with her.
And now was the Alderman standing beside her, and she said to
him: &lsquo;Friend and kinsman, this is the day of departure, and
though I must needs abide behind, and am content to abide, yet
doth mine heart ache with the sundering; for to-morrow when I
wake in the morning there will be no more sending of a messenger
to fetch thee to me.&nbsp; Indeed, great hath been the love
between me and my people, and nought hath come between us to mar
it.&nbsp; Now, kinsman, I would see Gold-mane, my cousin, that I
may bid him farewell; for who knoweth if I shall see him again
hereafter?&rsquo;
Then went Iron-face and found Face-of-god where he was
speaking with Folk-might and the chieftains, and said to him:
&lsquo;Come quickly, for thy cousin the Bride would speak with
thee.&rsquo;
Face-of-god reddened, and paled afterwards, but he went along
with his father silently; and his heart beat as he came and stood
before the litter whereas the Bride lay, clad all in white and
propped up on fair cushions of red silk.&nbsp; She was frail to
look on, and worn and pale yet; but he deemed that she was very
happy.
She smiled on him, and reached out her hand and said:
&lsquo;Welcome once more, cousin!&rsquo;&nbsp; And he held her
hand and kissed it, and was nigh weeping, so sore was he beset by
a throng of memories concerning her and him in the days when they
were little; and he bethought him of her loving-kindness of past
days, beyond that of most children, beyond that of most maidens;
and how there was nothing in his life but she had a share in it,
till the day when he found the Hall on the Mountain.
So he said to her: &lsquo;Kinswoman, is it well with
thee?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I am now nigh whole of my
hurts.&rsquo;
He was silent a while; then he said:
&lsquo;And otherwise art thou merry at heart?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, indeed,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;yet thou wilt not
find it hard to deem that I am sorry of the sundering betwixt me
and Burgdale.&rsquo;
p. 397Again
was he silent, and said in a while: &lsquo;Dost thou deem that I
wrought that sundering?&rsquo;
She smiled kindly on him and said: &lsquo;Gold-mane, my
playmate, thou art become a mighty warrior and a great chief; but
thou art not so mighty as that.&nbsp; Many things lay behind the
sundering which were neither thou nor I.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yet,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;it was but such a little
time agone that all things seemed so sure; and we&mdash;to both
of us was the outlook happy.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Let it be happy still,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;now
begrudging is gone.&nbsp; Belike the sundering came because we
were so sure, and had no defence against the wearing of the days;
even as it fareth with a folk that hath no foes.&rsquo;
He smiled and said: &lsquo;Even as it hath befallen thy
folk, O Bride, a while ago.&rsquo;
She reddened, and reached her hand to him, and he took it and
held it, and said: &lsquo;Shall I see thee again as the days
wear?&rsquo;
Said she: &lsquo;O chieftain of the Folk, thou shalt have much
to do in Burgdale, and the way is long.&nbsp; Yet would I have
thee see my children.&nbsp; Forget not the token on my hand which
thou holdest.&nbsp; But now get thee to thy folk with no more
words; for after all, playmate, the sundering is grievous to me,
and I would not spin out the time thereof.&nbsp;
Farewell!&rsquo;
He said no more, but stooped down and kissed her lips, and
then turned from her, and took his ways to the head of the Host,
and fell to asking and answering, and bidding and arraying; and
in a little time was his heart dancing with joy to think of the
days that lay before him, wherein now all seemed happy.
So was all arrayed for departure when it lacked three hours of
noon.&nbsp; As Folk-might had promised, there were certain light
wains drawn by bullocks abiding the departure of the Host, and of
sumpter bullocks and horses no few; and all these were laden with
fair gifts of the Dale, as silver, and raiment, and
weapons.&nbsp; There were many things fair-wrought in the time of
the Sorrow, p.
398that henceforth should see but little sorrow.&nbsp;
Moreover, there was plenty of provision for the way, both meal
and wine, and sheep and neat; and all things as fair as might be,
and well-arrayed.
It was the Shepherds who were to lead the way; and after them
were arrayed the men of the Vine and the Sickle; then they of the
Steer, the Bridge, and the Bull; and lastly the House of the
Face, with old Stone-face leading them.&nbsp; The Sun-beam was to
journey along with the House of the Steer, which had taken her in
as a maiden of their blood; and though she had so much liefer
have fared with the House of the Face, yet she went meekly as she
was bidden, as one who has gotten a great thing, and will make no
stir about a small one.
Along with her were Wood-father and Wood-mother, and
Wood-wise, now whole of his hurt, and Wood-wont, and
Bow-may.&nbsp; Save Bow-may, they were not very joyous; for they
were fain of Silver-dale, and it irked them to leave it;
moreover, they also had liefer have gone along with the House of
the War-leader.
Last of all went those people of the once thralls of the Dusky
Men who had cast in their lot with the Burgdalers, and they were
exceeding merry; and especially the women of them, they were
chattering like the stares in the autumn evening, when they
gather from the fields in the tall elm-trees before they go to
roost.
Now all the men of the Dale, both of the kindreds and of the
thrall-folk, made way for the Host and its havings, that they
might go their ways down the Dale; albeit the Woodlanders clung
close to the line of their ancient friends, and with them, as men
who were sorry for the sundering, were Wolf-stone and God-swain
and Spear-fist.&nbsp; But the chiefs, they drew around Folk-might
a little beside the way.
Now Red-coat of Waterless, who had been hurt, and was now
whole again, cast his arms about Folk-might and kissed him, and
said:
&lsquo;All the way hence to Burgdale will I sow with good
wishes p.
399for thee and thine, and especially for my dear friend
God-swain of the Silver Arm; and I would wish and long that they
might turn into spells to draw thy feet to usward; for we love
thee well.&rsquo;
In like wise spake other of the Burgdalers; and Folk-might was
kind and blithe with them, and he said:
&lsquo;Friends, forget ye not that the way is no longer from
you to us than it is from us to you.&nbsp; One half of this
matter it is for you to deal with.&rsquo;
&lsquo;True is that,&rsquo; said Red-beard of the Knolls,
&lsquo;but look you, Folk-might, we be but simple husbandmen, and
may not often stir from our meadows and acres; even now I bethink
me that May is amidst us, and I am beginning to be drawn by the
thought of the haysel.&nbsp; Whereas thou&mdash;&rsquo; (and
therewith he reddened) &lsquo;I doubt that thou hast little to do
save the work of chieftains, and we know that such work is but
little missed if it be undone.&rsquo;
Thereat Folk-might laughed; and when the others saw that he
laughed, they laughed also, else had they foreborne for
courtesy&rsquo;s sake.
But Folk-might answered: &lsquo;Nay, chief of the Sickle, I am
not altogether a chieftain, now we have gotten us peace; and
somewhat of a husbandman shall I be.&nbsp; Moreover, doubt ye not
that I shall do my utmost to behold the fair Dale again; for it
is but mountains that meet not.&rsquo;
Now spake Face-of-god to Folk-might, smiling and somewhat
softly, and said: &lsquo;Is all forgiven now, since the day when
we first felt each other&rsquo;s arms?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea, all,&rsquo; said Folk-might; &lsquo;now hath
befallen what I foretold thee in Shadowy Vale, that thou mightest
pay for all that had come and gone, if thou wouldest but look to
it.&nbsp; Indeed thou wert angry with me for that saying on that
eve of Shadowy Vale; but see thou, in those days I was an older
man than thou, and might admonish thee somewhat; but now, though
but few days have gone over thine head, yet many deeds have
abided in thine hand, and thou art much aged.&nbsp; Anger hath
left thee, and wisdom hath  span
class="pagenum">p. 400waxed in thee.&nbsp; As for me, I
may now say this word: May the Folk of Burgdale love the Folk of
Silver-dale as well as I love thee; then shall all be
well.&rsquo;
Then Face-of-god cast his arms about him and kissed him, and
turned away toward Stone-face and Hall-face his brother, where
they stood at the head of the array of the Face; and even
therewith came up the Alderman somewhat sad and sober of
countenance, and he pushed by the War-leader roughly and would
not speak with him.
And now blew up the horns of the Shepherds, and they began to
move on amidst the shouting of the men of Silver-dale; yet were
there amongst the Woodlanders those who wept when they saw their
friends verily departing from them.
But when they of the foremost of the Host were gotten so far
forward that the men of the Face could begin to move, lo! there
was Redesman with his fiddle amongst the leaders; and he had done
a man&rsquo;s work in the day of battle, and all looked kindly on
him.&nbsp; About him on this morn were some who had learned the
craft of singing well together, and knew his minstrelsy, and he
turned to these and nodded as their array moved on, and he drew
his bow across the strings, and straightway they fell a-singing,
even as it might be thus:
Back again to the dear Dale where born was the
kindred,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here wend we all living, and liveth our mirth.
Here afoot fares our joyance, whatever men hindred,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through all wrath of the heavens, all storms of the
earth.
O true, we have left here a part of our
treasure,
&nbsp;&nbsp; The ashes of stout ones, the stems of the shield; br
/>
But the bold lives they spended have sown us new pleasure,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair tales for the telling in fold and on field.
For as oft as we sing of their edges&rsquo;
upheaving,
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the yellowing windows shine forth o&rsquo;er
the night,
p. 401Their
names unforgotten with song interweaving
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall draw forth dear drops from the depths of
delight.
Or when down by our feet the grey sickles are
lying,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And behind us is curling the supper-tide smoke, br
/>
No whit shall they grudge us the joyance undying,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Remembrance of men that put from us the yoke.
When the huddle of ewes from the fells we have
driven,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And we see down the Dale the grey reach of the
roof,
We shall tell of the gift in the battle-joy given,
&nbsp;&nbsp; All the fierceness of friends that drave sorrow
aloof.
Once then we lamented, and mourned them
departed;
&nbsp;&nbsp; Once only, no oftener.&nbsp; Henceforth shall we
fling
Their names up aloft, when the merriest hearted
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the Fathers unseen of our life-days we sing.
Then was there silence in the ranks of men; and many murmured
the names of the fallen as they fared on their way from out the
Market-place of Silver-stead.&nbsp; Then once more Redesman and
his mates took up the song:
Come tell me, O friends, for whom bideth the
maiden
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wet-foot from the river-ford down in the Dale?
For whom hath the goodwife the ox-waggon laden
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the babble of children, brown-handed and
hale?
Come tell me for what are the women abiding, br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till each on the other aweary they lean?
Is it loitering of evil that thus they are chiding,
&nbsp;&nbsp; The slow-footed bearers of sorrow unseen?
Nay, yet were they toiling if sorrow had worn
them,
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or hushed had they bided with lips parched and
wan.
The birds of the air other tidings have borne them&mdash;
&nbsp;&nbsp; How glad through the wood goeth man beside man.
p.
402Then fare forth, O valiant, and loiter no longer
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than the cry of the cuckoo when May is at hand; br
/>
Late waxeth the spring-tide, and daylight grows longer,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And nightly the star-street hangs high o&rsquo;er
the land.
Many lives, many days for the Dale do ye
carry;
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the Host breaketh out from the thicket
unshorn,
It shall be as the sun that refuseth to tarry
&nbsp;&nbsp; On the crown of all mornings, the Midsummer
morn.
Again the song fell down till they were well on the western
way down Silver-dale; and then Redesman handled his fiddle once
more, and again the song rose up, and such-like were the words
which were borne back into the Market-place of Silver-stead:
And yet what is this, and why fare ye so
slowly,
&nbsp;&nbsp; While our echoing halls of our voices are dumb, br
/>
And abideth unlitten the hearth-brand the holy,
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the feet of the kind fare afield till we
come?
For not yet through the wood and its tangle ye
wander;
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now skirt we no thicket, no path by the mere;
Far aloof for our feet leads the Dale-road out yonder;
&nbsp;&nbsp; Full fair is the morning, its doings all clear.
There is nought now our feet on the highway
delaying
&nbsp;&nbsp; Save the friend&rsquo;s loving-kindness, the
sundering of speech;
The well-willer&rsquo;s word that ends words with the saying, br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The loth to depart while each looketh on each.
Fare on then, for nought are ye laden with
sorrow;
&nbsp;&nbsp; The love of this land do ye bear with you still. br
/>
In two Dales of the earth for to-day and to-morrow
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is waxing the oak-tree of peace and good-will.
Thus then they departed from Silver-dale, even as men who were
a portion thereof, and had not utterly left it behind.&nbsp; And
p. 403that
night they lay in the wild-wood not very far from the
Dale&rsquo;s end; for they went softly, faring amongst so many
friends.
CHAPTER LVI.&nbsp; TALK UPON THE WILD-WOOD WAY.
On the morrow morning when they
were on their way again Face-of-god left his own folk to go with
the House of the Steer a while; and amongst them he fell in with
the Sun-beam going along with Bow-may.&nbsp; So they greeted him
kindly, and Face-of-god fell into talk with the Sun-beam as they
went side by side through a great oak-wood, where for a space was
plain green-sward bare of all underwood.
So in their talk he said to her: &lsquo;What deemest thou, my
speech-friend, concerning our coming back to guest in Silver-dale
one day?&rsquo;
&lsquo;The way is long,&rsquo; she said.
&lsquo;That may hinder us but not stay us,&rsquo; said
Face-of-god.
&lsquo;That is sooth,&rsquo; said the Sun-beam.
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;What things shall stay us?&nbsp; Or
deemest thou that we shall never see Silver-dale
again?&rsquo;
She smiled: &lsquo;Even so I think thou deemest,
Gold-mane.&nbsp; But many things shall hinder us besides the long
road.&rsquo;
Said he: &lsquo;Yea, and what things?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Thinkest thou,&rsquo; said the Sun-beam, &lsquo;that
the winning of Silver-stead is the last battle which thou shalt
see?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;nay.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Shall thy Dale&mdash;our Dale&mdash;be free from all
trouble within itself henceforward?&nbsp; Is there a wall built
round it to keep out for ever storm, pestilence, and famine, and
the waywardness of its own folk?&rsquo;
&lsquo;So it is as thou sayest,&rsquo; quoth Face-of-god,
&lsquo;and to meet such troubles and overcome them, or to die in
strife with them, this is a great part of a man&rsquo;s
life.&rsquo;
p.
404&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and hast thou
forgotten that thou art now a great chieftain, and that the folk
shall look to thee to use thee many days in the year?&rsquo;
He laughed and said: &lsquo;So it is.&nbsp; How many days have
gone by since I wandered in the wood last autumn, that the world
should have changed so much!&rsquo;
&lsquo;Many deeds shall now be in thy days,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;and each deed as the corn of wheat from which cometh many
corns; and a man&rsquo;s days on the earth are not over
many.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Then farewell, Silver-dale!&rsquo; said he, waving his
hand toward the north.&nbsp; &lsquo;War and trouble may bring me
back to thee, but it maybe nought else shall.&nbsp;
Farewell!&rsquo;
She looked on him fondly but unsmiling, as he went beside her
strong and warrior-like.&nbsp; Three paces from him went Bow-may,
barefoot, in her white kirtle, but bearing her bow in her hand; a
leash of arrows was in her girdle, her quiver hung at her back,
and she was girt with a sword.&nbsp; On the other side went
Wood-wont and Wood-wise, lightly clad but weaponed.&nbsp;
Wood-mother was riding in an ox-wain just behind them, and
Wood-father went beside her bearing an axe.&nbsp; Scattered all
about them were the men of the Steer, gaily clad, bearing
weapons, so that the oak-wood was bright with them, and the
glades merry with their talk and singing and laughter, and before
them down the glades went the banner of the Steer, and the White
Beast led them the nearest way to Burgdale.
CHAPTER LVII.&nbsp; HOW THE HOST CAME HOME AGAIN.
It was fourteen days before they
came to Rose-dale; for they had much baggage with them, and they
had no mind to weary themselves, and the wood was nothing
loathsome to them, whereas the weather was fair and bright for
the more part.&nbsp; They fell in with no mishap by the
way.&nbsp; But a score and three  span
class="pagenum">p. 405of runaways joined themselves to the
Host, having watched their goings and wotting that they were not
foemen.&nbsp; Of these, some had heard of the overthrow of the
Dusky Men in Silver-dale, and others not.&nbsp; The Burgdalers
received them all, for it seemed to them no great matter for a
score or so of new-comers to the Dale.
But when the Host was come to Rose-dale, they found it fair
arid lovely; and there they met with those of their folk who had
gone with Dallach.&nbsp; But Dallach welcomed the kindreds with
great joy, and bade them abide; for he said that they had the
less need to hasten, since he had sent messengers into Burgdale
to tell men there of the tidings.&nbsp; Albeit they were mostly
loth to tarry; yet when he lay hard on them not to depart as men
on the morrow of a gild-feast, they abode there three days, and
were as well guested as might be, and on their departure they
were laden with gifts from the wealth of Rose-dale by Dallach and
his folk.
Before they went their ways Dallach spake with Face-of-god and
the chiefs of the Dalesmen, and said:
&lsquo;Ye have given me much from the time when ye found me in
the wood a naked wastrel; yet now I would ask you a gift to lay
on the top of all that ye have given me.&rsquo;
Said Face-of-god: &lsquo;Name the gift, and thou shalt have
it; for we deem thee our friend.&rsquo;
&lsquo;I am no less,&rsquo; said Dallach, &lsquo;as in time to
come I may perchance be able to show you.&nbsp; But now I am
asking you to suffer a score or two of your men to abide here
with me this summer, till I see how this folk new-born again is
like to deal with me.&nbsp; For pleasure and a fair life have
become so strange to them, that they scarce know what to do with
them, or how to live; and unless all is to go awry, I must needs
command and forbid; and though belike they love me, yet they fear
me not; so that when my commandment pleaseth them, they do as I
bid, and when it pleaseth them not, they do contrary to my  a
name="page406">p. 406bidding;
for it hath got into their minds that I shall in no case lift a
hand against them, which indeed is the very sooth.&nbsp; But your
folk they fear as warriors of the world, who have slain the Dusky
Men in the Market-place of Silver-stead; and they are of alien
blood to them, men who will do as their friend biddeth (think our
folk) against them who are neither friends or foes.&nbsp; With
such help I shall be well holpen.&rsquo;
In such wise spake Dallach; and Face-of-god and the chiefs
said that so it should be, if men could be found willing to abide
in Rose-dale for a while.&nbsp; And when the matter was put
abroad, there was no lack of such men amongst the younger
warriors, who had noted that the dale was fair amongst dales and
its women fairer yet amongst women.
So two score and ten of the Burgdale men abode in Rose-dale,
no one of whom was of more than twenty and five winters.&nbsp;
Forsooth divers of them set up house in Rose-dale, and never came
back to Burgdale, save as guests.&nbsp; For a half score were
wedded in Rose-dale before the year&rsquo;s ending; and seven
more, who had also taken to them wives of the goodliest of the
Rose-dale women, betook them the next spring to the Burg of the
Runaways, and there built them a stead, and drew a garth about
it, and dug and sowed the banks of the river, which they called
Inglebourne.&nbsp; And as years passed, this same stead throve
exceedingly, and men resorted thither both from Rose-dale and
Burgdale; for it was a pleasant place; and the land, when it was
cured, was sweet and good, and the wood thereabout was full of
deer of all kinds.&nbsp; So their stead was called Inglebourne
after the stream; and in latter days it became a very goodly
habitation of men.
Moreover, some of the once-enthralled folk of Rose-dale, when
they knew that men of their kindred from Silver-dale were going
home with the men of Burgdale to dwell in the Dale, prayed hard
to go along with them; for they looked on the Burgdalers as if
they were new Gods of the Earth.&nbsp; The Burgdale chiefs  a
name="page407">p. 407would not
gainsay these men either, but took with them three score and ten
from Rose-dale, men and women, and promised them dwelling and
livelihood in Burgdale.
So now with good hearts the Host of Burgdale turned their
faces toward their well-beloved Dale; and they made good
diligence, so that in three days&rsquo; time they were come anigh
the edge of the woodland wilderness.&nbsp; Thither in the
even-tide, as they were making ready for their last supper and
bed in the wood, came three men and two women of their folk, who
had been abiding their coming ever since they had had the tidings
of Silver-dale and the battles from Dallach.&nbsp; Great was the
joy of these messengers as they went from company to company of
the warriors, and saw the familiar faces of their friends, and
heard their wonted voices telling all the story of battle and
slaughter.&nbsp; And for their part the men of the Host feasted
these stay-at-homes, and made much of them.&nbsp; But one of
them, a man of the House of the Face, left the Host a little
after nightfall, and bore back to Burgstead at once the tidings
of the coming home of the Host.&nbsp; Albeit since
Dallach&rsquo;s tidings of victory had come to the Dale, the
dwellers in the steads of the country-side had left Burgstead and
gone home to their own houses; so that there was no great
multitude abiding in the Thorp.
So early on the morrow was the Host astir; but ere they came
to Wildlake&rsquo;s Way, the Shepherd-folk turned aside westward
to go home, after they had bidden farewell to their friends and
fellows of the Dale; for their souls longed for the sheepcotes in
the winding valleys under the long grey downs; and the garths
where the last year&rsquo;s ricks shouldered up against the old
stone gables, and where the daws were busy in the tall unfrequent
ash-trees; and the green flowery meadows adown along the bright
streams, where the crowfoot and the paigles were blooming now,
and the harebells were in flower about the thorn-bushes at the
down&rsquo;s foot, whence went the savour of their blossom over
sheep-walk and water-meadow.
p. 408So
these went their ways with many kind words; and two hours
afterwards all the rest of the Host stood on the level ground of
the Portway; but presently were the ranks of war disordered and
broken up by the joy of the women and children, as they fell to
drawing goodman or brother or lover out of the throng to the way
that led speediest to their homesteads and halls.&nbsp; For the
War-leader would not hold the Host together any longer, but
suffered each man to go to his home, deeming that the men of
Burgstead, and chiefly they of the Face and the Steer, would
suffice for a company if any need were, and they would be easily
gathered to meet any hap.
So now the men of the Middle and Lower Dale made for their
houses by the road and the lanes and the meadows, and the men of
the Upper Dale and Burgstead went their ways along the Portway
toward their halls, with the throng of women and children that
had come out to meet them.&nbsp; And now men came home when it
was yet early, and the long day lay before them; and it was, as
it were, made giddy and cumbered with the exceeding joy of
return, and the thought of the day when the fear of death and
sundering had been ever in their hearts.&nbsp; For these new
hours were full of the kissing and embracing of lovers, and the
sweetness of renewed delight in beholding the fair bodies so
sorely desired, and hearkening the soft wheedling of longed-for
voices.&nbsp; There were the cups of friends beneath the chestnut
trees, and the talk of the deeds of the fighting-men, and of the
heavy days of the home-abiders; many a tale told oft and
o&rsquo;er again.&nbsp; There was the singing of old songs and of
new, and the beholding the well-loved nook of the pleasant
places, which death might well have made nought for them; and
they were sweet with the fear of that which was past, and in
their pleasantness was fresh promise for the days to come.
So amid their joyance came evening and nightfall; and though
folk were weary with the fulness of delight, yet now for many
their weariness led them to the chamber of love before the rest
of p. 409deep
night came to them to make them strong for the happy life to be
begun again on the morrow.
House by house they feasted, and few were the lovers that sat
not together that even.&nbsp; But Face-of-god and the Sun-beam
parted at the door of the House of the Face; for needs must she
go with her new folk to the House of the Steer, and needs must
Face-of-god be amongst his own folk in that hour of high-tide,
and sit beside his father beneath the image of the God with the
ray-begirt head.
CHAPTER LVIII.&nbsp; HOW THE MAIDEN WARD WAS HELD IN
BURGDALE.
Now May was well worn when the Host
came home to Burgdale; and on the very morrow of men&rsquo;s
home-coming they began to talk eagerly of the Midsummer Weddings,
and how the Maiden Ward would be the greatest and fairest of all
yet seen, whereas battle and the deliverance from battle stir up
the longing and love both of men and maidens; much also men spake
of the wedding of Face-of-god and the Sun-beam; and needs must
their wedding abide to the time of the Maiden Ward at Midsummer,
and needs also must the Sun-beam go on the Ward with the other
Brides of the Folk.&nbsp; So then must Face-of-god keep his soul
in patience till those few days were over, doing what work came
to hand; and he held his head high among the people, and was well
looked to of every man.
In all matters the Sun-beam helped him, both in doing and in
forbearing; and now so wonderful and rare was her beauty, that
folk looked on her with somewhat of fear, as though she came from
the very folk of the Gods.
Indeed she seemed somewhat changed from what she had been of
late; she was sober of demeanour during these last days of  a
name="page410">p. 410her
maidenhood, and sat amongst the kindred as one communing with
herself: of few words she was and little laughter; but her face
clear, not overcast by any gloom or shaken by passion: soft and
kind was she in converse with others, and sweet were the smiles
that came into her face if others&rsquo; faces seemed to crave
for them.&nbsp; For it must be said that as some folk eat out
their hearts with fear of the coming evils, even so was she
feeding her soul with the joy of the days to be, whatever trouble
might fall upon them, whereof belike she foreboded some.
So wore the days toward Midsummer, when the wheat was getting
past the blossoming, and the grass in the mown fields was growing
deep green again after the shearing of the scythe; when the
leaves were most and biggest; when the roses were beginning to
fall; when the apples were reddening, and the skins of the
grape-berries gathering bloom.&nbsp; High aloft floated the light
clouds over the Dale; deep blue showed the distant fells below
the ice-mountains; the waters dwindled; all things sought the
shadow by daytime, and the twilight of even and the twilight of
dawn were but sundered by three hours of half-dark night.
So in the bright forenoon were seventeen brides assembled in
the Gate of Burgstead (but of the rest of the Dale were twenty
and three looked for), and with these was the Sun-beam, her face
as calm as the mountain lake under a summer sunset, while of the
others many were restless, and babbling like April throstles; and
not a few talked to her eagerly, and in their restless love of
her dragged her about hither and thither.
No men were to be seen that morning; for such was the custom,
that the carles either departed to the fields and the acres, or
abode within doors on the morn of the day of the Maiden Ward; but
there was a throng of women about the Gate and down the street of
Burgstead, and it may well be deemed that they kept not silence
that hour.
So fared the Brides of Burgstead to the place of the Maiden
Ward on the causeway, whereto were come already the other  a
name="page411">p. 411brides from
steads up and down the Dale, or were even then close at hand on
the way; and among them were Long-coat and her two fellows, with
whom Face-of-god had held converse on that morning whereon he had
followed his fate to the Mountain.
There then were they gathered under the cliff-wall of the
Portway; and by the road-side had their grooms built them up
bowers of green boughs to shelter them from the sun&rsquo;s
burning, which were thatched with bulrushes, and decked with
garlands of the fairest flowers of the meadows and the
gardens.
Forsooth they were a lovely sight to look on, for no fairer
women might be seen in the world; and the eldest of them was
scant of five and twenty winters.&nbsp; Every maiden was clad in
as goodly raiment as she might compass; their sleeves and
gown-hems and girdles, yea, their very shoes and sandals were
embroidered so fairly and closely, that as they shifted in the
sun they changed colour like the king-fisher shooting from shadow
to sunshine.&nbsp; According to due custom every maiden bore some
weapon.&nbsp; A few had bows in their hands and quivers at their
backs; some had nought but a sword girt to their sides; some bore
slender-shafted spears, so as not to overburden their shapely
hands; but to some it seemed a merry game to carry long and heavy
thrust-spears, or to bear great war-axes over their
shoulders.&nbsp; Most had their flowing hair coifed with bright
helms; some had burdened their arms with shields; some bore steel
hauberks over their linen smocks: almost all had some piece of
war-gear on their bodies; and one, to wit, Steed-linden of the
Sickle, a tall and fair damsel, was so arrayed that no garment
could be seen on her but bright steel war-gear.
As for the Sun-beam, she was clad in a white kirtle
embroidered from throat to hem with work of green boughs and
flowers of the goodliest fashion, and a garland of roses on her
head.&nbsp; Dale-warden himself was girt to her side by a girdle
fair-wrought of golden wire, and she bore no other weapon or
war-gear; and she let him lie quiet in his scabbard, nor touched
the hilts once; whereas  span
class="pagenum">p. 412some of the other damsels would be
ever drawing their swords out and thrusting them back.&nbsp; But
all noted that goodly weapon, the yoke-fellow of so many great
deeds.
There then on the Portway, between the water and the
rock-wall, rose up plenteous and gleeful talk of clear voices
shrill and soft; and whiles the maidens sang, and whiles they
told tales of old days, and whiles they joined hands and danced
together on the sweet summer dust of the highway.&nbsp; Then they
mostly grew aweary, and sat down on the banks of the road or
under their leafy bowers.
Noon came, and therewithal goodwives of the neighbouring Dale,
who brought them meat and drink, and fruit and fresh flowers from
the teeming gardens; and thereafter for a while they nursed their
joy in their bosoms, and spake but little and softly while the
day was at its hottest in the early afternoon.
Then came out of Burgstead men making semblance of chapmen
with a wain bearing wares, and they made as though they were
wending down the Portway westward to go out of the Dale.&nbsp;
Then arose the weaponed maidens and barred the way to them, and
turned them back amidst fresh-springing merriment.
Again in a while, when the sun was westering and the shadows
growing long, came herdsmen from down the Dale driving neat, and
making as though they would pass by into Burgstead, but to them
also did the maidens gainsay the road, so that needs must they
turn back amidst laughter and mockery, they themselves also
laughing and mocking.
And so at last, when the maidens had been all alone a while,
and it was now hard on sunset, they drew together and stood in a
ring, and fell to singing; and one Gold-may of the House of the
Bridge, a most sweet singer, stood amidst their ring and led
them.&nbsp; And this is somewhat of the meaning of their
words:
The sun will not tarry; now changeth the
light,
Fail the colours that marry the Day to the Night.
p.
413Amid the sun&rsquo;s burning bright weapons we bore, br
/>
For this eve of our earning comes once and no more.
For to-day hath no brother in yesterday&rsquo;s
tide,
And to-morrow no other alike it doth hide.
This day is the token of oath and behest
That ne&rsquo;er shall be broken through ill days and best.
Here the troth hath been given, the oath hath
been done,
To the Folk that hath thriven well under the sun.
And the gifts of its giving our troth-day shall
win
Are the Dale for our living and dear days therein.
O Sun, now thou wanest! yet come back and
see
Amidst all that thou gainest how gainful are we.
O witness of sorrow wide over the earth,
Rise up on the morrow to look on our mirth!
Thy blooms art thou bringing back ever for
men,
And thy birds are a-singing each summer again.
But to men little-hearted what winter is
worse
Than thy summers departed that bore them the curse?
And e&rsquo;en such art thou knowing where
thriveth the year,
And good is all growing save thralldom and fear.
Nought such be our lovers&rsquo; hearts drawing
anigh,
While yet thy light hovers aloft in the sky.
Lo the seeker, the finder of Death in the
Blade!
What lips shall be kinder on lips of mine laid?
La he that hath driven back tribes of the
South!
Sweet-breathed is thine even, but sweeter his mouth.
p.
414Come back from the sea then, O sun! come aback,
Look adown, look on me then, and ask what I lack!
Come many a morrow to gaze on the Dale,
And if e&rsquo;er thou seest sorrow remember its tale!
For &rsquo;twill be of a story to tell how men
died
In the garnering of glory that no man may hide.
O sun sinking under!&nbsp; O fragrance of
earth!
O heart!&nbsp; O the wonder whence longing has birth!
So they sang, and the sun sank indeed; and amidst their
singing the eve was still about them, though there came a happy
murmur from the face of the meadows and the houses of the Thorp
aloof.&nbsp; But as their song fell they heard the sound of
footsteps a many on the road; so they turned and stood with
beating hearts in such order as when a band of the valiant draw
together to meet many foes coming on them from all sides, and
they stand back to back to face all comers.&nbsp; And even
therewith, their raiment gleaming amidst the gathering dusk, came
on them the young men of the Dale newly delivered from the grief
of war.
Then in very deed the fierce mouths of the raisers of the
war-shout were kind on the faces of tender maidens.&nbsp; Then
went spear and axe and helm and shield clattering to the earth,
as the arms of the new-comers went round about the bodies of the
Brides, weary with the long day of sunshine, and glee and loving
speech, and the maidens suffered the young men to lead them
whither they would, and twilight began to draw round about them
as the Maiden Band was sundered.
Some, they were led away westward down the Portway to the
homesteads thereabout; and for divers of these the way was long
to their halls, and they would have to wend over long stretches
of dewy meadows, and hear the night-wind whisper in  a
name="page415">p. 415many a
tree, and see the east begin to lighten with the dawn before they
came to the lighted feast that awaited them.&nbsp; But some
turned up the Portway straight towards Burgstead; and short was
their road to the halls where even now the lights were being
kindled for their greeting.
As for the Sun-beam, she had been very quiet the day long,
speaking as little as she might do, laughing not at all, and
smiling for kindness&rsquo; sake rather than for merriment; and
when the grooms came seeking their maidens, she withdrew herself
from the band, and stood alone amidst the road nigher to
Burgstead than they; and her heart beat hard, and her breath came
short and quick, as though fear had caught her in its grip; and
indeed for one moment of time she feared that he was not coming
to her.&nbsp; For he had gone with the other grooms to that
gathered band, and had passed from one to the other, not finding
her, till he had got him through the whole company, and beheld
her awaiting him.&nbsp; Then indeed he bounded toward her, and
caught her by the hands, and then by the shoulders, and drew her
to him, and she nothing loth; and in that while he said to
her:
&lsquo;Come then, my friend; lo thou! they go each their own
way toward the halls of their houses; and for thee have I chosen
a way&mdash;a way over the foot-bridge yonder, and over the dewy
meadows on this best even of the year.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Nay, nay,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;it may not be.&nbsp;
Surely the Burgstead grooms look to thee to lead them to the
gate; and surely in the House of the Face they look to see thee
before any other.&nbsp; Nay, Gold-mane, my dear, we must needs go
by the Portway.&rsquo;
He said: &lsquo;We shall be home but a very little while after
the first, for the way I tell of is as short as the
Portway.&nbsp; But hearken, my sweet!&nbsp; When we are in the
meadows we shall sit down for a minute on a bank under the
chestnut trees, and thence watch the moon coming up over the
southern cliffs.&nbsp; And I shall behold thee in the summer
night, and deem that I see  span
class="pagenum">p. 416all thy beauty; which yet shall make
me dumb with wonder when I see it indeed in the house amongst the
candles.&rsquo;
&lsquo;O nay,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;by the Portway shall we
go; the torch-bearers shall be abiding thee at the
gate.&rsquo;
Spake Face-of-god: &lsquo;Then shall we rise up and wend first
through a wide treeless meadow, wherein amidst the night we shall
behold the kine moving about like odorous shadows; and through
the greyness of the moonlight thou shalt deem that thou seest the
pink colour of the eglantine blossoms, so fragrant they
are.&rsquo;
&lsquo;O nay,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but it is meet that we
go by the Portway.&rsquo;
But he said: &lsquo;Then from the wide meadow come we into a
close of corn, and then into an orchard-close beyond it.&nbsp;
There in the ancient walnut-tree the owl sitteth breathing hard
in the night-time; but thou shalt not hear him for the joy of the
nightingales singing from the apple-trees of the close.&nbsp;
Then from out of the shadowed orchard shall we come into the open
town-meadow, and over its daisies shall the moonlight be lying in
a grey flood of brightness.
&lsquo;Short is the way across it to the brim of the Weltering
Water, and across the water lieth the fair garden of the Face;
and I have dight for thee there a little boat to waft us across
the night-dark waters, that shall be like wavering flames of
white fire where the moon smites them, and like the void of all
things where the shadows hang over them.&nbsp; There then shall
we be in the garden, beholding how the hall-windows are yellow,
and hearkening the sound of the hall-glee borne across the
flowers and blending with the voice of the nightingales in the
trees.&nbsp; There then shall we go along the grass paths whereby
the pinks and the cloves and the lavender are sending forth their
fragrance, to cheer us, who faint at the scent of the over-worn
roses, and the honey-sweetness of the lilies.
&lsquo;All this is for thee, and for nought but for thee this
even; and many a blossom whereof thou knowest nought shall grieve
if p. 417thy
foot tread not thereby to-night; if the path of thy wedding which
I have made, be void of thee, on the even of the Chamber of
Love.
&lsquo;But lo! at last at the garden&rsquo;s end is the
yew-walk arched over for thee, and thou canst not see whereby to
enter it; but I, I know it, and I lead thee into and along the
dark tunnel through the moonlight, and thine hand is not weary of
mine as we go.&nbsp; But at the end shall we come to a wicket,
which shall bring us out by the gable-end of the Hall of the
Face.&nbsp; Turn we about its corner then, and there are we
blinking on the torches of the torch-bearers, and the candles
through the open door, and the hall ablaze with light and full of
joyous clamour, like the bale-fire in the dark night kindled on a
ness above the sea by fisher-folk remembering the
Gods.&rsquo;
&lsquo;O nay,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but by the Portway must
we go; the straightest way to the Gate of Burgstead.&rsquo;
In vain she spake, and knew not what she said; for even as he
was speaking he led her away, and her feet went as her will went,
rather than her words; and even as she said that last word she
set her foot on the first board of the foot-bridge; and she
turned aback one moment, and saw the long line of the rock-wall
yet glowing with the last of the sunset of midsummer, while as
she turned again, lo! before her the moon just beginning to lift
himself above the edge of the southern cliffs, and betwixt her
and him all Burgdale, and Face-of-god moreover.
Thus then they crossed the bridge into the green meadows, and
through the closes and into the garden of the Face and unto the
Hall-door; and other brides and grooms were there before them
(for six grooms had brought home brides to the House of the
Face); but none deemed it amiss in the War-leader of the folk and
the love that had led him.&nbsp; And old Stone-face said:
&lsquo;Too many are the rows of bee-skeps in the gardens of the
Dale that we should begrudge wayward lovers an hour&rsquo;s waste
of candle-light.&rsquo;
p. 418So at
last those twain went up the sun-bright Hall hand in hand in all
their loveliness, and up on to the da&iuml;s, and stood together
by the middle seat; and the tumult of the joy of the kindred was
hushed for a while as they saw that there was speech in the mouth
of the War-leader.
Then he spread his hands abroad before them all and cried out:
&lsquo;How then have I kept mine oath, whereas I swore on the
Holy Boar to wed the fairest woman of the world?&rsquo;
A mighty shout went rattling about the timbers of the roof in
answer to his word; and they that looked up to the gable of the
Hall said that they saw the ray-ringed image of the God smile
with joy over the gathered folk.
But spake Iron-face unheard amidst the clamour of the Hall:
&lsquo;How fares it now with my darling and my daughter, who
dwelleth amongst strangers in the land beyond the
wild-wood?&rsquo;
CHAPTER LIX.&nbsp; THE BEHEST OF FACE-OF-GOD TO THE BRIDE
ACCOMPLISHED: A MOTE-STEAD APPOINTED FOR THE THREE FOLKS, TO WIT,
THE MEN OF BURGDALE, THE SHEPHERDS, AND THE CHILDREN OF THE
WOLF.
Three years and two months
thereafter, three hours after noon in the days of early autumn,
came a wain tilted over with precious webs of cloth, and drawn by
eight white oxen, into the Market-place of Silver-stead: two
score and ten of spearmen of the tallest, clad in goodly
war-gear, went beside it, and much people of Silver-dale thronged
about them.&nbsp; The wain stayed at the foot of the stair that
led up to the door of the Mote-house, and there lighted down
therefrom a woman goodly of fashion, with wide grey eyes, and
face and hands brown with the sun&rsquo;s burning.&nbsp; She had
a helm on her head and a sword girt to her side, and in her arms
she bore a yearling child.
p. 419And
there was come Bow-may with the second man-child born to
Face-of-god.
She stayed not amidst the wondering folk, but hastened up the
stair, which she had once seen running with the blood of men: the
door was open, and she went in and walked straight-way, with the
babe in her arms, up the great Hall to the da&iuml;s.
There were men on the da&iuml;s: amidmost sat Folk-might,
little changed since the last day she had seen him, yet fairer,
she deemed, than of old time; and her heart went forth to meet
the Chieftain of her Folk, and the glad tears started in her eyes
and ran down her cheeks as she drew near to him.
By his side sat the Bride, and her also Bow-may deemed to have
waxed goodlier.&nbsp; Both she and Folk-might knew Bow-may ere
she had gone half the length of the hall; and the Bride rose up
in her place and cried out Bow-may&rsquo;s name joyously.
With these were sitting the elders of the Wolf and the
Woodlanders, the more part of whom Bow-may knew well.
On the da&iuml;s also stood aside a score of men weaponed, and
looking as if they were awaiting the word which should send them
forth on some errand.
Now stood up Folk-might and said: &lsquo;Fair greeting and
love to my friend and the daughter of my Folk!&nbsp; How farest
thou, Bow-may, best of all friendly women?&nbsp; How fareth my
sister, and Face-of-god my brother? and how is it with our
friends and helpers in the goodly Dale?&rsquo;
Said Bow-may: &lsquo;It is well both with all those and with
me; and my heart laughs to see thee, Folk-might, and to look on
the elders of the valiant, and our lovely sister the Bride.&nbsp;
But I have a message for thee from Face-of-god: wilt thou that I
deliver it here?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea surely,&rsquo; said Folk-might, and came forth and
took her hand, and kissed her cheeks and her mouth.&nbsp; The
Bride also came forth and cast her arms about her, and kissed
her; and they led her between them to a seat on the da&iuml;s
beside Folk-might.
But all men looked on the child in her arms and wondered  a
name="page420">p. 420what it
was.&nbsp; But Bow-may took the babe, which was both fair and
great, and set it on the knees of the Bride, and said:
&lsquo;Thus saith Face-of-god: &ldquo;Friend and kinswoman,
well-beloved playmate, the gift which thou badest of me in sorrow
do thou now take in joy, and do all the good thou wouldest to the
son of thy friend.&nbsp; The ring which I gave thee once in the
garden of the Face, give thou to Bow-may, my trusty and
well-beloved, in token of the fulfilment of my
behest.&rdquo;&rsquo;
Then the Bride kissed Bow-may again, and fell to fondling of
the child, which was loth to leave Bow-may.
But she spake again: &lsquo;To thee also, Folk-might, I have a
message from Face-of-god, who saith: &ldquo;Mighty warrior,
friend and fellow, all things thrive with us, and we are
happy.&nbsp; Yet is there a hollow place in our hearts which
grieveth us, and only thou and thine may amend it.&nbsp; Though
whiles we hear tell of thee, yet we see thee not, and fain were
we, might we see thee, and wot if the said tales be true.&nbsp;
Wilt thou help us somewhat herein, or wilt thou leave us all the
labour?&nbsp; For sure we be that thou wilt not say that thou
rememberest us no more, and that thy love for us is
departed.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is his message, Folk-might, and he
would have an answer from thee.&rsquo;
Then laughed Folk-might and said: &lsquo;Sister Bow-may, seest
thou these weaponed men hereby?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; she said.
Said he: &lsquo;These men bear a message with them to
Face-of-god my brother.&nbsp; Crow the Shaft-speeder, stand forth
and tell thy friend Bow-may the message I have set in thy mouth,
every word of it.&rsquo;
Then Crow stood forth and greeted Bow-may friendly, and said:
&lsquo;Friend Bow-may, this is the message of our Alderman:
&ldquo;Friend and helper, in the Dale which thou hast given to us
do all things thrive; neither are we grown old in three
years&rsquo; wearing, nor are our memories worsened.&nbsp; We
long sore to see you and give you guesting in Silver-dale, and
one day that shall p.
421befall.&nbsp; Meanwhile, know this: that we of the Wolf
and the Woodland, mindful of the earth that bore us, and the pit
whence we were digged, have a mind to go see Shadowy Vale once in
every three years, and there to hold high-tide in the ancient
Hall of the Wolf, and sit in the Doom-ring of our Fathers.&nbsp;
But since ye have joined yourselves to us in battle, and have
given us this Dale, our health and wealth, without price and
without reward, we deem you our very brethren, and small shall be
our hall-glee, and barren shall our Doom-ring seem to us, unless
ye sit there beside us.&nbsp; Come then, that we may rejoice each
other by the sight of face and sound of voice; that we may speak
together of matters that concern our welfare; so that we three
Kindreds may become one Folk.&nbsp; And if this seem good to you,
know that we shall be in Shadowy Vale in a half-month&rsquo;s
wearing.&nbsp; Grieve us not by forbearing to come.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Lo, Bow-may, this is the message, and I have learned it well, for
well it pleaseth me to bear it.&rsquo;
Then said Folk-might: &lsquo;What say&rsquo;st thou to the
message, Bow-may?&rsquo;
&lsquo;It is good in all ways,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;but is
it timely?&nbsp; May our folk have the message and get to Shadowy
Vale, so as to meet you there?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea surely,&rsquo; said Folk-might, &lsquo;for our
kinsmen here shall take the road through Shadowy Vale, and in
four days&rsquo; time they shall be in Burgdale, and as thou
wottest, it is scant a two days&rsquo; journey thence to Shadowy
Vale.&rsquo;
Therewith he turned to those men again, and said:
&lsquo;Kinsman Crow, depart now, and use all diligence with thy
message.&rsquo;
So the messengers began to stir; but Bow-may cried out:
&lsquo;Ho!&nbsp; Folk-might, my friend, I perceive thou art
little changed from the man I knew in Shadowy Vale, who would
have his dinner before the fowl were plucked.&nbsp; For shall I
not go back with these thy messengers, so that I also may get all
ready to wend to the Mote-house of Shadowy Vale?&rsquo;
p. 422But
the Bride looked kindly on her, and laughed and said:
&lsquo;Sister Bow-may, his meaning is that thou shouldest abide
here in Silver-dale till we depart for the Folk-thing, and then
go thither with us; and this I also pray thee to do, that thou
mayst rejoice the hearts of thine old friends; and also that thou
mayst teach me all that I should know concerning this fair child
of my brother and my sister.&rsquo;
And she looked on her so kindly as she caressed the babe, that
Bow-may&rsquo;s heart melted, and she cried out:
&lsquo;Would that I might never depart from the house wherein
thou dwellest, O Bride of my Kinsman!&nbsp; And this that thou
biddest me is easy and pleasant for me to do.&nbsp; But
afterwards I must get me back to Burgdale; for I seem to have
left much there that calleth for me.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; said Folk-might, &lsquo;and art thou
wedded, Bow-may?&nbsp; Shalt thou never bend the yew in battle
again?&rsquo;
Said Bow-may soberly: &lsquo;Who knoweth, chieftain?&nbsp;
Yea, I am wedded now these two years; and nought I looked for
less when I followed those twain through the wild-wood to
Burgdale.&rsquo;
She sighed therewith, and said: &lsquo;In all the Dale there
is no better man of his hands than my man, nor any goodlier to
look on, and he is even that Hart of Highcliff whom thou knowest
well, O Bride!&rsquo;
Said the Bride: &lsquo;Thou sayest sooth, there is no better
man in the Dale.&rsquo;
Said Bow-may: &lsquo;Sun-beam bade me wed him when he pressed
hard upon me.&rsquo;&nbsp; She stayed awhile, and then said:
&lsquo;Face-of-god also deemed I should not naysay the man; and
now my son by him is of like age to this little one.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Good is thy story,&rsquo; said Folk-might; &lsquo;or
deemest thou, Bow-may, that such strong and goodly women as thou,
and women so kind and friendly, should forbear the wedding and
the bringing forth of children?&nbsp; Yea, and we who may even
yet have to gather p.
423to another field before we die, and fight for life and
the goods of life.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Thou sayest well,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;all that hath
befallen me is good since the day whereon I loosed shaft from the
break of the bent over yonder.&rsquo;
Therewith she fell a-musing, and made as though she were
hearkening to the soft voice of the Bride caressing the new-come
baby; but in sooth neither heard nor saw what was going on about
her, for her thoughts were in bygone days.&nbsp; Howbeit
presently she came to herself again, and fell to asking many
questions concerning Silver-dale and the kindred, and those who
had once been thralls of the Dusky Men; and they answered all
duly, and told her the whole story of the Dale since the Day of
the Victory.
So Bow-may and the carles who had come with her abode for that
half-month in Silver-dale, guested in all love by the folk
thereof, both the kindreds and the poor folk.&nbsp; And Bow-may
deemed that the Bride loved Face-of-god&rsquo;s child little less
than her own, whereof she had two, a man and a woman; and thereat
was she full of joy, since she knew that Face-of-god and the
Sun-beam would be fain thereof.
Thereafter, when the time was come, fared Folk-might and the
Bride, and many of the elders and warriors of the Wolf and the
Woodland, to Shadowy Vale; and Dallach and the best of Rose-dale
went with them, being so bidden; and Bow-may and her following,
according to the word of the Bride.&nbsp; And in Shadowy Vale
they met Face-of-god and Alderman Iron-face, and the chiefs of
Burgdale and the Shepherds, and many others; and great joy there
was at the meeting.&nbsp; And the Sun-beam remembered the word
which she spoke to Face-of-god when first he came to Shadowy
Vale, that she would be wishful to see again the dwelling wherein
she had passed through so much joy and sorrow of her younger
days.&nbsp; But if anyone were fain of this meeting, the Alderman
was glad above all, when he took the  span
class="pagenum">p. 424Bride once more in his arms, and
caressed her whom he had deemed should be a very daughter of his
House.
Now telleth the tale of all these kindreds, to wit, the Men of
Burgdale and the Sheepcotes; and the Children of the Wolf, and
the Woodlanders, and the Men of Rose-dale, that they were friends
henceforth, and became as one Folk, for better or worse, in peace
and in war, in waning and waxing; and that whatsoever befell
them, they ever held Shadowy Vale a holy place, and for long and
long after they met there in mid-autumn, and held converse and
counsel together.
No more as now telleth the tale of these
Kindreds and Folks, but maketh an ending.

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
