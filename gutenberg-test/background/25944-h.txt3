AMERICAN ILLUSTRATED

MEDICAL DICTIONARY

For Students and Practitioners

A New and Complete Dictionary of the terms used in Medicine, Surgery,
Dentistry, Pharmacy, Chemistry, and kindred branches; together with
new and elaborate Tables of Arteries, Muscles, Nerves, Veins, etc.;
of Bacilli, Bacteria, Micrococci, etc.; Eponymic Tables of Diseases,
Operations, Signs and Symptoms, Stains, Tests, Methods of Treatment,
etc. By W.A.N. Dorland, M.D., Editor of the American
Pocket Medical Dictionary. Large octavo, nearly 800 pages, bound in
full flexible leather. Price, $4.50 net; with thumb index, $5.00 net.

JUST ISSUED       NEW (4) REVISED EDITION--2000 NEW WORDS

It contains a maximum amount of matter in a minimum
space and at the lowest possible cost.

This book contains double the material in the ordinary students' dictionary,
and yet, by the use of a clear, condensed type and thin paper of the
finest quality, is only 1-3/4 inches in thickness. It is bound in full flexible leather,
and is just the kind of a book that a man will want to keep on his desk for constant
reference. The book makes a special feature of the newer words, and
defines hundreds of important terms not to be found in any other dictionary. It
is especially full in the matter of tables, containing more than a hundred of
great practical value, including new tables of Tests, Stains and Staining Methods.
A new feature is the inclusion of numerous handsome illustrations, many of
them in colors, drawn and engraved specially for this book.

       I must acknowledge my astonishment at seeing how much he has condensed within relatively
small space. I find nothing to criticise, very much to commend, and was interested in
finding some of the new words which are not in other recent dictionaries.              Roswell Park,
Professor of Principles and Practice of Surgery and Clinical Surgery, University of Buffalo.

       Dr. Dorland's Dictionary is admirable. It is so well gotten up and of such convenient
size. No errors have been found in my use of it.              Howard A. Kelly, Professor of Gynecology,
Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore.

HUNDREDS OF NEW TERMS

Bound in Full Leather, Limp, with Gold Edges. Price, $1.00 net;

The book is an absolutely new one. It is not a revision
of any old work, but it has been written entirely anew
and is constructed on lines that experience has shown to be
the most practical for a work of this kind. It aims to be
complete, and to that end contains practically all the terms
of modern medicine. This makes an unusually large vocabulary.
Besides the ordinary dictionary terms the book contains
a wealth of anatomical and other tables. This matter is
of particular value to students for memorizing in preparation
for examination.

       I am struck at once with admiration at the compact size and attractive exterior.
I can recommend it to our students without reserve.              James W. Holland,
M.D., of Jefferson Medical College.

       This is a handy pocket dictionary, which is so full and complete that it puts
to shame some of the more pretentious volumes.              Journal of the American
Medical Association.

       We have consulted it for the meaning of many new and rare terms, and
have not met with a disappointment. The definitions are exquisitely clear and
concise. We have never found so much information in so small a space.              Dublin
Journal of Medical Science.

       This is a handy little volume that, upon examination, seems fairly to fulfil
the promise of its title, and to contain a vast amount of information in a very
small space.... It is somewhat surprising that it contains so many of the rarer
terms used in medicine.              Bulletin Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore.

PREFACE TO SEVENTH EDITION.



In the present       seventh       edition the subject matter, especially
as regards the practical part, has been gone over carefully and the
necessary corrections and additions made. Nineteen new illustrations
have been added, a few of the old ones being eliminated. It
is hoped that the continued demand for this compend means a
widening interest in the study of diseases of the skin, sufficiently
keen as to lead to the desire for a still greater knowledge.

PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION.



Much of the present volume is, in a measure, the outcome of a
thorough revision, remodelling and simplification of the various
articles contributed by the author to Pepper's System of Medicine,
Buck's Reference Handbook of the Medical Sciences, and Keating's
Cyclop       dia of the Diseases of Children. Moreover, in the endeavor
to present the subject as tersely and briefly as compatible with clear
understanding, the several standard treatises on diseases of the skin
by Tilbury Fox, Duhring, Hyde, Robinson, Anderson, and Crocker,
have been freely consulted, that of the last-named author suggesting
the pictorial presentation of the        Anatomy of the Skin.       
The space allotted to each disease has been based upon relative
importance. As to treatment, the best and approved methods
only       those which are founded upon the aggregate experience of
dermatologists       are referred to.

For general information a statistical table from the Transactions
of the American Dermatological Association is appended.

SYMPTOMATOLOGY.

The symptoms of cutaneous disease may be objective, subjective
or both; and in some diseases, also, there may be systemic disturbance.

What do you mean by objective symptoms?

Those symptoms visible to the eye or touch.


What do you understand by subjective symptoms?

Those which relate to sensation, such as itching, tingling, burning,
pain, tenderness, heat, an       sthesia, and hyper       sthesia.


What do you mean by systemic symptoms?

Those general symptoms, slight or profound, which are sometimes
associated, primarily or secondarily, with the cutaneous disease, as, for
example, the systemic disturbance in leprosy, pemphigus, and purpura
hemorrhagica.


Into what two classes of lesions are the objective symptoms
commonly divided?

Primary (or elementary), and
Secondary (or consecutive).



Primary Lesions.


What are primary lesions?

Those objective lesions with which cutaneous diseases begin. They
may continue as such or may undergo modification, passing into the
secondary or consecutive lesions.


Enumerate the primary lesions.

Macules, papules, tubercles, wheals, tumors, vesicles, blebs and
pustules.


What are macules (macul       )?

Variously-sized, shaped and tinted spots and discolorations, without
elevation or depression; as, for example, freckles, spots of
purpura, macules of cutaneous syphilis.
[Pg 23]

What are papules (papul       )?

Small, circumscribed, solid elevations, rarely exceeding the size of
a split-pea, and usually superficially seated; as, for example, the
papules of eczema, of acne, and of cutaneous syphilis.


What are tubercles (tubercula)?

Circumscribed, solid elevations, commonly pea-sized and usually
deep-seated; as, for example, the tubercles of syphilis, of leprosy,
and of lupus.


What are wheals (pomphi)?

Variously-sized and shaped, whitish, pinkish or reddish elevations,
of an evanescent character; as, for example, the lesions of urticaria,
the lesions produced by the bite of a mosquito or by the sting of a
nettle.


What are tumors (tumores)?

Soft or firm elevations, usually large and prominent, and having
their seat in the corium and subcutaneous tissue; as, for example,
sebaceous tumors, gummata, and the lesions of fibroma.


What are vesicles (vesicul       )?

Pin-head to pea-sized, circumscribed epidermal elevations, containing
serous fluid; as, for example, the so-called fever-blisters, the
lesions of herpes zoster, and of vesicular eczema.


What are blebs (bull       )?

Rounded or irregularly-shaped, pea to egg-sized epidermic elevations,
with fluid contents; in short, they are essentially the same as
vesicles and pustules except as to size; as, for example, the blebs
of pemphigus, rhus poisoning, and syphilis.


What are pustules (pustul       )?

Circumscribed epidermic elevations containing pus; as, for example,
the pustules of acne, of impetigo, and of sycosis.



Secondary Lesions.


What are secondary lesions?

Those lesions resulting from accidental or natural change, modification
or termination of the primary lesions.
[Pg 24]

Enumerate the secondary lesions.

Scales, crusts, excoriations, fissures, ulcers, scars and stains.

What are scales (squam       )?

Dry, laminated, epidermal exfoliations; as, for example, the scales
of psoriasis, ichthyosis, and eczema.

What are crusts (crust       )?

Dried effete masses of exudation; as, for example, the crusts of
impetigo, of eczema, and of the pustular and ulcerating syphilodermata.

What are excoriations (excoriationes)?

Superficial, usually epidermal, linear or punctate loss of tissue;
as, for example, ordinary scratch-marks.

What are fissures (rhagades)?

Linear cracks or wounds, involving the epidermis, or epidermis and
corium; as, for example, the cracks which often occur in eczema
when seated about the joints, the cracks of chapped lips and
hands.

What are ulcers (ulcera)?

Rounded or irregularly-shaped and sized loss of skin and subcutaneous
tissue resulting from disease; as, for example, the ulcers
of syphilis and of cancer.

What are scars (cicatrices)?

Connective-tissue new formations replacing loss of substance.

What are stains?

Discolorations left by cutaneous disease, which stains may be transitory
or permanent.


Distribution and Configuration.

What do you mean by a patch of eruption?

A single group or aggregation of lesions or an area of disease.

When is an eruption said to be limited or localized?

When it is confined to one part or region.
[Pg 25]

When is an eruption said to be general or generalized?

When it is scattered, uniformly or irregularly, over the entire
surface.

When is an eruption universal?

When the whole integument is involved, without any intervening
healthy skin.

When is an eruption said to be discrete?

When the lesions constituting the eruption are isolated, having
more or less intervening normal skin.

When is an eruption confluent?

When the lesions constituting the eruption are so closely crowded
that a solid sheet results.

When is an eruption uniform?

When the lesions constituting the eruption are all of one type or
character.

When is an eruption multiform?

When the lesions constituting the eruption are of two or more
types or characters.

When are lesions said to be aggregated?

When they tend to form groups or closely-crowded patches.

When are lesions disseminated?

When they are irregularly scattered, with no tendency to form
groups or patches.

When is a patch of eruption said to be circinate?

When it presents a rounded form, and usually tending to clear in
the centre; as, for example, a patch of ringworm.

When is a patch of eruption said to be annular?

When it is ring-shaped, the central portion being clear; as, for
example, in erythema annulare.

What meaning is conveyed by the term        iris       ?

The patch of eruption is made up of several concentric rings.
Difference of duration of the individual rings, usually slight, tends to
give the patch variegated coloration; as, for example, in erythema
iris and herpes iris.
[Pg 26]

What meaning is conveyed by the term        marginate       ?

The sheet of eruption is sharply defined against the healthy
skin; as, for example, in erythema marginatum, eczema marginatum.

What meaning is conveyed by the qualifying term        circumscribed       ?

The term is applied to small, usually more or less rounded, patches,
when sharply defined; as, for example, the typical patches of psoriasis.

When is the qualifying term        gyrate        employed?

When the patches arrange themselves in an irregular winding or
festoon-like manner; as, for instance, in some cases of psoriasis. It
results, usually, from the coalescence of several rings, the eruption
disappearing at the points of contact.

When is an eruption said to be serpiginous?

When the eruption spreads at the border, clearing up at the older
part; as, for instance, in the serpiginous syphiloderm.


RELATIVE FREQUENCY.

Name the more common cutaneous diseases and state approximately
their frequency.

Eczema, 30.4%; syphilis cutanea, 11.2%; acne, 7.3%; pediculosis,
4%; psoriasis, 3.3%; ringworm, 3.2%; dermatitis, 2.6%; scabies,
2.6%; urticaria, 2.5%; pruritus, 2.1%; seborrh       a, 2.1%; herpes
simplex, 1.7%; favus, 1.7%; impetigo, 1.4%; herpes zoster, 1.2%;
verruca, 1.1%; tinea versicolor, 1%. Total: eighteen diseases,
representing 81 per cent. of all cases met with.

(These percentages are based upon statistics, public and private,
of the American Dermatological Association, covering a period of
ten years. In private practice the proportion of cases of pediculosis,
scabies, favus, and impetigo is much smaller, while acne, acne
rosacea, seborrh       a, epithelioma, and lupus are relatively more frequent.)
[Pg 27]


CONTAGIOUSNESS.

Name the more actively contagious skin diseases.

Impetigo contagiosa, ringworm, favus, scabies and pediculosis;
excluding the exanthemata, erysipelas, syphilis and certain rare and
doubtful diseases.

[At the present time when most diseases are presumed to be due
to bacteria or parasites the belief in contagiousness, under certain
conditions, has considerably broadened.]


RAPIDITY OF CURE.

Is the rapid cure of a skin disease fraught with any danger
to the patient?

No. It was formerly so considered, especially by the public and
general profession, and the impression still holds to some extent, but
it is not in accord with dermatological experience.


OINTMENT BASES.

Name the several fats in common use for ointment bases.

Lard, petrolatum (or cosmoline or vaseline), cold cream and
lanolin.

State the relative advantages of these several bases.

Lard is the best all-around base, possessing penetrating properties
scarcely exceeded by any other fat.

Petrolatum is also valuable, having little, if any, tendency to
change; it is useful as a protective, but is lacking in its power of
penetration.

Cold Cream (ungt. aqu        ros       ) is soothing and cooling, and may
often be used when other fatty applications disagree.

Lanolin is said to surpass in its power of penetration all other
bases, but this is not borne out by experience. It is an unsatisfactory
base when used alone. It should be mixed with another
base in about the proportion of 25% to 50%.

These several bases may, and often with advantage, be variously
combined.
[Pg 28]

What is to be added to these several bases if a stiffer ointment
is required?

Simple cerate, wax, spermaceti, or suet; or in some instances, a
pulverulent substance, such as starch, boric acid, and zinc oxide.


CLASS I.       DISORDERS OF THE GLANDS.

Hyperidrosis.


Fig. 6.






A normal sweat-gland, highly magnified. (After Neumann.)

a, Sweat-coil: b, sweat-duct; c, lumen of duct; d, connective-tissue capsule;
e and f, arterial trunk and capillaries.

What is hyperidrosis?

Hyperidrosis is a functional disturbance of the sweat-glands, characterized
by an increased production of sweat. This increase may
be slight or excessive, local or general.
[Pg 29]

As a local affection, what parts are most commonly involved?

The hands, feet, especially the palmar and plantar surfaces, the
axill        and the genitalia.

Describe the symptoms of the local forms of hyperidrosis.

The essential, and frequently the sole symptom, is more or less
profuse sweating.

If the hands are the parts involved, they are noted to be wet,
clammy and sometimes cold.

If involving the soles, the skin often becomes more or less macerated
and sodden in appearance, and as a result of this maceration
and continued irritation they may become inflamed, especially about
the borders of the affected parts, and present a pinkish or pinkish-red
color, having a violaceous tinge. The sweat undergoes change
and becomes offensive.

Is hyperidrosis acute or chronic?

Usually chronic, although it may also occur as an acute affection.

What is the etiology of hyperidrosis?

Debility is commonly the cause in general hyperidrosis; the local
forms are probably neurotic in origin.

What is the prognosis?

The disease is usually persistent and often rebellious to treatment;
in many instances a permanent cure is possible, in others palliation.
Relapses are not uncommon.

What systemic remedies are employed in hyperidrosis?

Ergot, belladonna, gallic acid, mineral acids, and tonics. Constitutional
treatment is rarely of benefit in the local forms of hyperidrosis,
and external applications are seldom of service in general
hyperidrosis. Precipitated sulphur, a teaspoonful twice daily, is
also well spoken of, combined, if necessary, with an astringent.

What external remedies are employed in the local forms?

Astringent lotions of zinc sulphate, tannin and alum, applied several
times daily, with or without the supplementary use of dusting-powders.
Weak solutions of formaldehyde, one to one hundred,
are sometimes of value.
[Pg 30]

Dusting-powders of boric acid and zinc oxide, to which may be
added from ten to thirty grains of salicylic acid to the ounce, to be
used freely and often:       


          Pulv. ac. salicylici, ............................ gr. x-xxx.
    Pulv. ac. borici, ................................       v.
    Pulv. zinci oxidi, ...............................       iij   M.


Diachylon ointment, and an ointment containing a drachm of tannin
to the ounce; more especially applicable in hyperidrosis of the
feet. The parts are first thoroughly washed, rubbed dry with towels
and dusting-powder, and the ointment applied on strips of muslin or
lint and bound on; the dressing is renewed twice daily, the parts
each time being rubbed dry with soft towels and dusting-powder,
and the treatment continued for ten days to two weeks, after which
the dusting-powder is to be used alone for several weeks. No water
is to be used after the first washing until the ointment is discontinued.
One such course will occasionally suffice, but not infrequently a repetition
is necessary.

Faradization and galvanization are sometimes serviceable. Repeated
mild exposures to the R      ntgen rays have a favorable influence
in some instances.


Sudamen.

(Synonym: Miliaria crystallina.)

What is sudamen?

Sudamen is a non-inflammatory disorder of the sweat-glands, characterized
by pin-point to pin-head-sized, discrete but thickly-set,
superficial, translucent whitish vesicles.

Describe the clinical characters.

The lesions develop rapidly and in great numbers, either irregularly
or in crops, and are usually to be seen as discrete, closely-crowded,
whitish, or pearl-colored minute elevations, occurring most abundantly
upon the trunk. In appearance they resemble minute dew-drops.
They are non-inflammatory, without areola, never become
purulent, and evince no tendency to rupture, the fluid disappearing
by absorption, and the epidermal covering by desquamation.
[Pg 31]

Give the course and duration of sudamen.

New crops may appear as the older lesions are disappearing, and
the affection persist for some time, or, on the other hand, the whole
process may come to an end in several days or a week. In short,
the course and duration depend upon the subsidence or persistence
of the cause.

What is the anatomical seat of sudamen?

The lesions are formed between the lamell        of the corneous layer,
usually the upper part; and are thought to be due to some change
in the character of the epithelial cells of this layer, probably from
high temperature, giving rise to a blocking up of the surface outlet.

What is the cause of sudamen?

Debility, especially when associated with high fever. The eruption
is often seen in the course of typhus, typhoid and rheumatic fevers.

How would you treat sudamen?

By constitutional remedies directed against the predisposing factor
or factors, and the application of cooling lotions of vinegar or alcohol
and water, or dusting-powders of starch and lycopodium.


Hydrocystoma.

Describe hydrocystoma.

Hydrocystoma is a cystic affection of the sweat-gland ducts, seated
upon the face. The lesions may be present in scant numbers or in
more or less profusion. They have the appearance of boiled sago
grains imbedded in the skin; the larger lesions may have a bluish
color, especially about the periphery. It is not common, and is
usually seen in washerwomen and laundresses, or those exposed to
moist heat. In some cases it tends to disappear during the winter
months. There are no subjective symptoms.

Treatment consists of puncturing the lesions and application of
dusting-powder. Avoidance of the exciting cause (moist heat) is
important.


Anidrosis.

Describe anidrosis.

It is the opposite condition of hyperidrosis, and is characterized
[Pg 32]
by diminution or suppression of the sweat secretion. It occurs to
some extent in certain systemic diseases and also in some affections
of the skin, such as ichthyosis; nerve-injuries may give rise to localized
sweat-suppression.

Treatment is based upon general principles; friction, warm and
hot-vapor baths, electricity and similar measures are of service.


Bromidrosis.

(Synonym: Osmidrosis.)


Describe bromidrosis.

Bromidrosis is a functional disturbance of the sweat-glands characterized
by a sweat secretion of an offensive odor. The sweat production
may be normal in quantity or more or less excessive, usually the
latter. The condition may be local or general, commonly the former.
It is closely allied to hyperidrosis, and may often be considered
identical, the odor resulting from rapid decomposition of the sweat
secretion. The decomposition and resulting odor have been thought
due to the presence of bacteria.

What parts are most commonly affected in bromidrosis?

The feet and the axill       .

What is the treatment of bromidrosis?

It is essentially the same as that of hyperidrosis (q. v.), consisting
of applications of astringent lotions, dusting-powders, especially
those containing boric acid and salicylic acid, and the continuous
application of diachylon ointment. In obstinate cases weak formaldehyde
solutions, R      ntgen rays, and high-frequency currents can
be tried.


Chromidrosis.

Describe chromidrosis.

This is a functional disorder of the sweat-glands characterized by
a secretion variously colored, and usually increased in quantity. It
is, as a rule, limited to a circumscribed area. The most common
color is red. The condition is probably of neurotic origin and tends
to recur. (True chromidrosis is extremely rare; most of the cases
formerly thought to be such are now known to be examples of
pseudochromidrosis.)
[Pg 33]

Treatment should be invigorating and tonic, with special reference
toward the nervous system. The various methods of local electrization
should also be resorted to.

Mild antiseptic and astringent lotions or dusting powders should
also be advised.

Red chromidrosis or Pseudochromidrosis is a condition in which
the coloring of the sweat occurs after its excretion and is due to the
presence of chromatogenous bacteria which are found attached to
the hairs of the part in agglutinated masses. The axilla is the favorite
site. Treatment consists of frequent soap-and-water washings,
and the application of boric acid, resorcin, and corrosive sublimate
lotions.


Uridrosis.

Describe uridrosis.

Uridrosis is a rare condition in which the sweat secretion contains
the elements of the urine, especially urea. In marked cases the salt
may be noticeable upon the skin as a colorless or whitish crystalline
deposit. In most instances it has been preceded or accompanied by
partial or complete suppression of the renal functions.


Phosphoridrosis.

Describe phosphoridrosis.

Phosphoridrosis is a rare condition, in which the sweat is phosphorescent.
It has been observed in the later stages of phthisis, in
miliaria, and in those who have eaten of putrid fish.


Seborrh       a (Eczema Seborrhoicum).

Synonyms: (Steatorrh       a; Acne sebacea; Ichthyosis sebacea; Dandruff.)

What is seborrh       a?

Seborrh       a is a disease of the sebaceous glands, characterized by
an excessive and abnormal secretion of sebaceous matter, appearing
on the skin as an oily coating, crusts, or scales.

In many cases the sweat-glands are likewise implicated, and the
process may also be distinctly, although usually mildly, inflammatory.
[Pg 34]

At what age is seborrh       a usually observed?

Between fifteen and forty. It may, however, occur at any age.

Name the parts most commonly affected.

The scalp, face, and (less frequently) the sternal and interscapular
regions of the trunk. It is sometimes seen on other parts.

What varieties of seborrh       a are encountered?

Seborrh       a oleosa and seborrh       a sicca; not infrequently the disease
is of a mixed type.

What are the symptoms of seborrh       a oleosa?

The sole symptom is an unnatural oiliness, variable as to degree.
Its most common sites are the regions of the scalp, nose, and forehead.
In many instances mild rosacea coexists with oily seborrh       a
of the nose.

Give the symptoms of seborrh       a sicca.

A variable degree of greasy scalines, which may be seated upon
a pale, hyper       mic or mildly inflammatory surface.

The parts affected are covered scantily or more or less abundantly
with somewhat greasy, grayish, or brownish-gray scales. If upon the
scalp (dandruff, pityriasis capitis), small particles of scales are found
scattered through the hair, and when the latter is brushed or combed,
fall over the shoulders. If upon the face, in addition to the scaliness,
the sebaceous ducts are usually seen to be enlarged and filled with
sebaceous matter.

Describe the symptoms of the ordinary or mixed type.

It is common upon the scalp. The skin is covered with irregularly
diffused, greasy, grayish or brownish scales and crusts, in some
cases moderate in quantity, in others so great that large irregular
masses are formed, pasting the hair to the scalp. If removed, the
scales and crusts rapidly re-form. The skin beneath is found slate-colored,
hyper       mic or mildly inflammatory, and exceptionally it has
in places an eczematous aspect (eczema seborrhoicum). Extraneous
matter, such as dust and dirt, collects upon the parts, and the
whole mass may become more or less offensive. There is a strong
tendency to falling-out of the hair. Itching may or may not be
present.







Seborrh       a (Eczema Seborrhoicum).

[Pg 35]


Describe the symptoms of seborrh       a of the trunk and other
parts.

Fig. 7.







A normal sebaceous gland in connection with a lanugo hair. (After Neumann.)

a, Capsule; b, fatty secretion; c, h, secreting cells; d, root of lanugo hair; e, hair-sac;
f, hair-shaft; g, acini of sebaceous gland.

Seborrh       a corporis differs in a measure, in its symptoms, from
seborrh       a of the scalp and is usually illustrative of the variety
known as eczema seborrhoicum; it occurs as one or several irregular
or circinate, slightly hyper       mic or moderately inflammatory patches,
covered with dirty or grayish-looking greasy scales or crusts, usually
moderate in quantity, and upon removal are found to have projections
into the sebaceous ducts. It is commonly seen upon the sternal
and interscapular regions. It rarely exists independently in these
regions, being usually associated with and following the disease on the
scalp. It may also invade the axill       , genitocrural, and other regions.
[Pg 36]

What is the usual course of seborrh       a?

Essentially chronic, the disease varying in intensity from time to
time. In occasional instances it disappears spontaneously.

Give the cause or causes of seborrh       a.

General debility, an       mia, chlorosis, dyspepsia, and similar conditions
are to be variously looked upon as predisposing.

In some instances, however, the disease seems to be purely local
in character, and to be entirely independent of any constitutional or
predisposing condition. The view recently advanced that the disease
is of parasitic nature and contagious has been steadily gaining
ground.

What is the pathology of seborrh       a?

Seborrh       a is a disease of the sebaceous glands, and probably
often involving the sweat-glands also; its products, as found upon
the skin, consisting of the sebaceous secretion, epithelial cells from
the glands and ducts, and more or less extraneous matter. Not
infrequently evidences of superficial inflammatory action are also to
be found, and it is especially for this type that the name eczema
seborrhoicum is most appropriate. In long-continued and neglected
cases slight atrophy of the gland-structures may occur.

With what diseases are you likely to confound seborrh       a?

Upon the scalp, with eczema and psoriasis; upon the face, with
lupus erythematosus and eczema; and upon the trunk, with psoriasis
and ringworm.

As a rule, the clinical features of seborrh       a are sufficiently characteristic
to prevent error.

What are the differential points?

Eczema, psoriasis, and lupus erythematosus are diseases in which
there are distinct inflammatory symptoms, such as thickening and
infiltration and redness; moreover, psoriasis, and this holds true as to
ringworm also, occurs in sharply-defined, circumscribed patches, and
lupus erythematosus has a peculiar violaceous tint and an elevated
and marginate border. A microscopic examination of the epidermic
scrapings would be of crucial value in differentiating from ringworm.

Quite frequently, especially in the interscapular and sternal regions,
the segmental configuration constitutes an important feature
of seborrh       a       of the eczema seborrhoicum variety.
[Pg 37]

What is the prognosis in seborrh       a?

Favorable. All types are curable, and when upon the non-hairy
regions, usually readily so; upon the scalp it is often obstinate.
Relapses are not uncommon.

In those cases of seborrh       a capitis which have been
long-continued
or neglected, and attended with loss of hair, this loss may be
more or less permanent, although ordinarily much can be done to
promote a regrowth (see Treatment of Alopecia).

How would you treat seborrh       a of the scalp?

By constitutional (if indicated) and local remedies; the former
having in view correction or modification of the predisposing factor
or factors, and the latter removal of the sebaceous accumulations and
the application of mildly stimulating antiseptic ointments or lotions.

What constitutional remedies are commonly employed?

The various tonics, such as iron, quinine, strychnia, cod-liver oil,
arsenic, the vegetable bitters, laxatives, malt and similar preparations.
The line of treatment is to be based upon indications.

How do you free the scalp of the sebaceous accumulations?

In mild types of the disease shampooing with simple Castile soap
(or any other good toilet soap) and hot water will suffice; in those
cases in which there is considerable scale-and crust-formation the
tincture of green soap (tinct. saponis viridis) is to be employed in
place of the toilet soap, and in some of these latter cases it may be
necessary to soften the crusts with a previous soaking with olive oil.

The frequency of the shampoo depends upon the conditions. In
mild cases once in five or ten days will be sufficiently frequent to
keep the parts clean, but in those cases in which there is rapid
scale-or crust-production once daily or every second day may at
first be demanded.

Name the most effectual applications in seborrh       a capitis.

Sulphur, ammoniated mercury, salicylic acid, resorcin, and carbolic
acid.

Sulphur is used in the form of an ointment, from twenty grains
to one drachm in the ounce. Ammoniated mercury, in the form of
an ointment, ten to sixty grains to the ounce. Salicylic acid, either
alone as an ointment, ten to thirty grains to the ounce; or it may
[Pg 38]


often be added with advantage, in the same proportion, to the sulphur
or ammoniated mercury ointment above named. Resorcin,
either as an ointment, ten to thirty grains to the ounce, or as an
alcoholic or aqueous lotion, as the following:       


          Resorcini, .......................................       j-      iss.
    Ol. ricini, ......................................        xxx-f      ij.
    Alcoholis, ...................................... f       iv.   M.


Carbolic acid, to the amount of ten to thirty grains, can be added to
this. If an aqueous lotion is desirable, then in the above formula
the oleum ricini is replaced with glycerine, and the alcohol with
water; three to five minims of glycerine in each ounce is usually
sufficient, as a greater quantity makes the resulting lotion sticky.
Petrolatum alone, or with 10 to 30 per cent. lanolin, is usually the
most satisfactory base for the ointments. In some cases of the
inflammatory variety the skin is found quite irritable, and the mildest
applications are at first only admissible.

How are the remedies to be applied?

A small quantity of the lotion, ointment, or oil is gently applied
to the skin; when to the scalp, a lotion or oil can be conveniently
applied by means of an eye-dropper. In the beginning of the treatment
an application once or twice daily is ordered; later, as the
disease becomes less active, once every second or third day.

How is seborrh       a upon other parts to be treated?

In the same general manner as seborrh       a of the scalp, except that
the local applications must be somewhat weaker. The several sulphur
lotions employed in the treatment of acne (q. v.) may also be
used when the disease is upon these parts. In obstinate patchy
cases occasional paintings with a 20 to 50 per cent alcoholic solution
of resorcin is curative; following the painting a mild salve should
be used.

Comedo.

(Synonyms: Blackheads; Flesh-worms.)

What is comedo?

Comedo is a disorder of the sebaceous glands, characterized by
yellowish or blackish pin-point or pin-head-sized puncta or elevations
corresponding to the gland-orifices.
[Pg 39]


At what age and upon what parts are comedones found?

Usually between fifteen and thirty, and upon the face and upper
part of the trunk, where they may exist sparsely or in great numbers.
They are occasionally associated with oily seborrh       a, the
parts presenting a greasy or soiled appearance.

Exceptionally they occur as distinct, and usually symmetrical,
groups upon the forehead or the cheeks. On the upper trunk
so-called
double and multiple comedo have been noted       the two,
three, or even four closely-contiguous blackheads are, beneath the
surface, intercommunicable, the dividing duct-walls having apparently
disappeared by fusion.


Describe an individual lesion.

It is pin-point to pin-head in size, dark yellowish, and usually with
a central blackish point (hence the name blackheads). There is
scarcely perceptible elevation, unless the amount of retained secretion
is excessive. Upon pressure this may be ejected, the small,
rounded orifice through which it is expressed giving it a
thread-like
shape (hence the name flesh-worms).


What is the usual course of comedo?


Chronic. The lesions may persist indefinitely or the condition
may be somewhat variable. In many instances, either as a result of
pressure or in consequence of chemical change in the sebaceous
plugs or of the addition of a microbic factor, inflammation is excited
and acne results. The two conditions are, in fact, usually associated.

Fig. 8.





Demodex Folliculorum, X 300. Ventral surface. (After Simon).

To what may comedo often be ascribed?

To disorders of digestion, constipation, chlorosis, menstrual disturbance,
lack of tone in the muscular fibres of the skin, the infrequent
use of soap, and working in a dirty or dusty atmosphere.
[Pg 40]
A small parasite (demodex folliculorum, acarus folliculorum) is
sometimes found in the sebaceous mass, but its presence is without
etiological significance, as it is also found in healthy follicles. A
microbacillus has been found by several observers, and credited
with etiological influence.


What is the pathology of comedo?

The sebaceous ducts or glands, or both, become blocked up with
retained secretion and epithelial cells. The dark points which
usually mark the lesions are probably due to accumulation of dirt,
but may, as some writers maintain, be due to the presence of pigment-granules
resulting from chemical change in the sebaceous matter.


Is there any difficulty in the diagnosis of comedo?

No. It can scarcely be confounded with milium, as in this latter
disease the lesion has no open outlet, no black point, and the contents
cannot be squeezed out.


Give the prognosis of comedo.

The result of treatment is usually favorable, although the disease
is often rebellious. Relapses are not uncommon.


How would you treat a case of comedo?

By systemic (if indicated) and local measures.

The constitutional treatment aims at correction or palliation of the
predisposing conditions, and the external applications have in view
a removal of the sebaceous plugs and stimulation of the glands and
skin to healthy action.

Fig. 9.



Comedo Extractor.


Name the systemic remedies commonly employed.

Cod-liver oil, iron, quinine, arsenic, nux vomica and other tonics;
ergot in those cases in which there is lack of muscular tone, salines
and aperient pills in constipation. The digestion is to be looked
after and the bowels kept regular; indigestible food of all kinds is
to be interdicted. Hygienic measures, such as general and local
bathing, local massage, calisthenics, and open-air exercise, are of
service.
[Pg 41]

Describe the local treatment.

Steaming the face or prolonged applications of hot water; washing
with ordinary toilet soap and hot water, or, in sluggish cases,
using tincture of green soap (tinct. saponis viridis) instead of the
toilet soap; removal of the sebaceous plugs by mechanical means,
such as lateral pressure with the finger ends or perpendicular pressure
with a watch-key with rounded edges, or with an instrument
specially contrived for this purpose; and after these preliminary
measures, which should be carried out every night, a stimulating
sulphur ointment or lotion, such as employed in the treatment of
acne (q. v.), is to be thoroughly applied. The following is valuable:       


          Zinci sulphatis,
    Potassi sulphureti, ...................            .........       j-      iv.
    Alcoholi ........................................ f       ss.
    Aqu       , ........................... q.s. ad. ...... f       iv.   M.


Should slight scaliness or a mild degree of irritation of the skin
be brought about, active external treatment is to be discontinued for
a few days and soothing applications made. Resorcin, in lotion, 3
to 25 per cent strength, is through the exfoliation it provokes, frequently
of value; the resorcin paste referred to in acne can also be
used for this purpose.

Moderately strong applications of the Faradic current, repeated
once or twice weekly, are sometimes of service; also weak to moderately
strong applications of the continuous and high-frequency
currents. R      ntgen-ray treatment can also be resorted to in extremely
obstinate cases.

In occasional instances sulphur preparations not only fail to do
good, but materially aggravate the condition. In such cases, if resorcin
preparations also fail, the mercurial lotion and ointment employed
in acne may be prescribed. Mercurial and sulphur applications
should not be used, it need scarcely be said, within a week or
ten days of each other, otherwise an increase in the comedones and
a slight darkening of the skin result from the formation of the black
sulphuret of mercury.
[Pg 42]


Milium.
(Synonyms: Grutum; Strophulus Albidus.)

What is milium?

Milium consists in the formation of small, whitish or yellowish,
rounded, pearly, non-inflammatory elevations situated in the upper
part of the corium.

Describe the clinical appearances.

The lesions are usually pin-head in size, whitish or yellowish, seemingly
more or less translucent, rounded or acuminated, without
aperture or duct, are superficially seated in the skin, and project
slightly above the surface.

They appear about the face, especially about the eyelids; they
may occur also, although rarely, upon other parts. But one or
several may be present, or they may exist in numbers.

What is the course of milium?

The lesions develop slowly, and may then remain stationary for
years. Their presence gives rise to no disturbance, and, unless they
are large in size or exist in numbers, causes but slight disfigurement.

Fig. 10.



Milium Needle.

In rare instances they may undergo calcareous metamorphosis, constituting
the so-called cutaneous calculi.

What is the anatomical seat of milium?

The sebaceous gland (probably one or several of the superficially-situated
acini), the duct of which is in some manner obliterated, the
sebaceous matter collects, becomes inspissated and calcareous, forming
the pin-head lesion. The epidermis is the external covering.

What is the treatment?

The usual plan is to prick or incise each lesion and press out the
contents. In some milia it may be necessary also, in order to prevent
a return, to touch the base of the excavation with tincture of
[Pg 43]
iodine or with silver nitrate. Electrolysis is also effectual. In those
cases where the lesions are numerous the production of exfoliation
of the epiderm by means of resorcin applications (see acne) is a
good plan.


Steatoma.

(Synonyms: Sebaceous Cyst; Sebaceous Tumor; Wen.)

Describe steatoma.

Steatoma, or sebaceous cyst, appears as a variously-sized, elevated,
rounded or semi-globular, soft or firm tumor, freely movable and
painless, and having its seat in the corium or subcutaneous tissue.
The overlying skin is normal in color, or it may be whitish or pale
from distention; in some a gland-duct orifice may be seen, but, as a
rule, this is absent.

What are the favorite regions for the development of steatoma?

The scalp, face and back. One or several may be present.

What is the course of sebaceous cysts?

Their growth is slow, and, after attaining a variable size, may remain
stationary. They may exist indefinitely without causing any
inconvenience beyond the disfigurement. Exceptionally, in enormously
distended growths, suppuration and ulceration result.

What is the pathology?

A steatoma is a cyst of the sebaceous gland and duct, produced
by retained secretion. The contents may be hard and friable, soft
and cheesy, or even fluid, of a grayish, whitish or yellowish color,
and with or without a fetid odor; the mass consisting of fat-drops,
epidermic cells, cholesterin, and sometimes hairs.

Are sebaceous cysts likely to be confounded with gummata?

No. Gummata grow more rapidly, are usually painful to the
touch, are not freely movable, and tend to break down and ulcerate.

Describe the treatment of steatoma.

A linear incision is made, and the mass and enveloping sac
[Pg 44]
dissected out. If the sac is permitted to remain, reproduction almost
invariably takes place.



CLASS II.       INFLAMMATIONS.

Erythema Simplex.


What do you understand by erythema simplex?

Erythema simplex is a hyper       mic disorder characterized by redness,
occurring in the form of variously-sized and shaped, diffused
or circumscribed, non-elevated patches.

Name the two general classes into which the simple erythemata
are divided.

Idiopathic and symptomatic.

What do you include in the idiopathic class?

Those erythemas due to external causes, such as cold and heat
(erythema caloricum), the action of the sun (erythema solare), traumatism
(erythema traumaticum), and the various poisons or chemical
irritants (erythema venenatum).

What do you include in the symptomatic class?

Those rashes often preceding or accompanying certain of the systemic
diseases, and those due to disorders of the digestive tract,
stomachic and intestinal toxins, to the ingestion of certain drugs,
and to use of the therapeutic serums.

Describe the symptoms of erythema simplex.

The essential symptom is redness       simple hyper       mia       without
elevation or infiltration, disappearing under pressure, and sometimes
attended by slight heat or burning; it may be patchy or diffused. In
the idiopathic class, if the cause is continued, dermatitis may result.

What is to be said about the distribution of the simple erythemata?

The idiopathic rashes, as inferred from the nature of the causes,
are usually limited.

The symptomatic erythemas are more or less generalized; desquamation
sometimes follows.
[Pg 45]

Describe the treatment of the simple erythemata.

A removal of the cause in idiopathic rashes is all that is needed,
the erythema sooner or later subsiding. The same may be stated of
the symptomatic erythemata, but in these there is at times difficulty
in recognizing the etiological factor; constitutional treatment, if
necessary, is to be based upon general principles. Intestinal antiseptics
are useful in some instances.

Local treatment, which is rarely needed, consists of the use of
dusting-powders or mild cooling and astringent lotions, such as are
employed in the treatment of acute eczema (q. v.).



Erythema Intertrigo.
(Synonym: Chafing.)

What do you understand by erythema intertrigo?

Erythema intertrigo is a hyper       mic disorder occurring on parts
where the natural folds of the skin come in contact, and is characterized
by redness, to which may be added an abraded surface and
maceration of the epidermis.

Describe the symptoms of erythema intertrigo.

The skin of the involved region gradually becomes hyper       mic,
but is without elevation or infiltration; a feeling of heat and soreness
is usually experienced. If the condition continue, the increased
perspiration and moisture of the parts give rise to maceration of the
epidermis and a mucoid discharge; actual inflammation may eventually
result.

What is the course of erythema intertrigo?

The affection may pass away in a few days or persist several weeks,
the duration depending, in a great measure, upon the cause.

Mention the causes of erythema intertrigo.

The causes are usually local. It is seen chiefly in children, especially
in fat subjects, in whom friction and moisture of contiguous
parts of the body, usually the region of the neck, buttocks and genitalia,
are more common; in such, uncleanliness or the too free use
of soap washings will often act as the exciting factor. Disorders of
[Pg 46]
the stomach or intestinal canal apparently have a predisposing influence.


What treatment would you advise in erythema intertrigo?

The folds or parts are to be kept from contact by means of lint or
absorbent cotton; thin, flat bags of cheese cloth or similar material
partly filled with dusting-powder, and kept clean by frequent
changes, are excellent for this purpose, and usually curative.
Cleanliness is essential, but it is to be kept within the bounds of
common sense. Dusting-powders and cooling and astringent lotions,
such as are employed in the treatment of acute eczema (q. v.), can
also be advised. The following lotion is valuable:       


          Pulv. calamin       ,
    Pulv. zinci oxidi, ....................            .........       iss.
    Glycerin       , .......................................        xxx
    Alcoholis, ...................................... f      ij
    Aqu       , ............................................ Oss.   M.


Exceptionally a mild ointment, alone or supplementary to a lotion,
acts more satisfactorily.

In persistent or obstinate cases attention should also be directed to
the state of the general health, especially as regards the digestive tract.


Erythema Multiforme.


What is erythema multiforme?

Erythema multiforme is an acute, inflammatory disease, characterized
by reddish, more or less variegated macules, papules, and tubercles,
occurring as discrete lesions or in patches of various size and
shape.


Upon what parts of the body does the eruption appear?

Usually upon the extremities, especially the dorsal aspect, from
the knees and elbows down, and about the face and neck; it may,
however, be more or less general.


Describe the symptoms of erythema multiforme.

With or without precursory symptoms of malaise, gastric uneasiness
or rheumatic pains, the eruption suddenly makes its appearance,
[Pg 47]
assuming an erythematous, papular, tubercular or mixed character;
as a rule, one type of lesion predominates. The lesions tend to
increase in size and intensity, remain stationary for several days or a
week, and then gradually fade; during this time there may have
been outbreaks of new lesions. In color they are pink, red, or
violaceous. Slight itching may or may not be present. Exceptionally,
in general cases, the eruption partakes of the nature of both
urticaria and erythema multiforme, and itching may be quite a
decided symptom. In some instances there is preceding and accompanying
febrile action, usually slight in character; in others
there may be some rheumatic swelling of one or more joints.

Fig. 11.






Erythema Multiforme, in which many of the lesions have become bullous       
Erythema Bullosum.

[Pg 48]


What type of the eruption is most common?

The papular, appearing usually upon the backs of the hands and
forearms, and not infrequently, also, upon the face, legs and feet.
The papules are usually pea-sized, flattened, and of a dark red or
violaceous color.


Describe the various shapes which the erythematous lesions
may assume.

Often the patches are distinctly ring-shaped, with a clear centre       
erythema annulare; or they are made up of several concentric
rings, presenting variegated coloring       erythema iris; or a more or
less extensive patch may spread with a sharply-defined border, the
older part tending to fade       erythema marginatum; or several rings
may coalesce, with a disappearance of the coalescing parts, and serpentine
lines or bands result       erythema gyratum.


Does the eruption of erythema multiforme ever assume a
vesicular or bullous character?

Yes. In exceptional instances, the inflammatory process may be
sufficiently intense to produce vesiculation, usually at the summits
of the papules       erythema vesiculosum; and in some instances, blebs
may be formed       erythema bullosum. A vesicular or bullous lesion
may become immediately surrounded by a ring-like vesicle or bleb,
and outside of this another form; a patch may be made up of as
many as several such rings       herpes iris. In the vesicular and bullous
cases the lips and the mucous membranes of the mouth and
nose also may be the seat of similar lesions.


What is the course of erythema multiforme?

Acute, the symptoms disappearing spontaneously, usually in one
to three or four weeks. In some instances the recurrences take
place so rapidly that the disease assumes a chronic aspect; it is
possible that such cases are midway cases between this disease and
dermatitis herpetiformis.


Mention the etiological factors in erythema multiforme.

The causes are obscure. Digestive disturbance, rheumatic conditions,
and the ingestion of certain drugs are at times influential.
Intestinal toxins are doubtless important etiological factors in some
cases. Certain foods, such as are apt to undergo rapid putrefactive
[Pg 49]
or fermentative change, especially pork meats, oysters, fish, crabs,
lobsters, etc., are, therefore, not infrequently of apparent causative
influence. It is most frequently observed in spring and autumn
months, and in early adult life. The disease is not uncommon.


What is the pathology of erythema multiforme?

It is a mildly inflammatory disorder, somewhat similar to urticaria,
and presumably due to vasomotor disturbance; the amount of exudation,
which is variable, determines the character of the lesions.


Name the diagnostic points of erythema multiforme.

The multiformity of the eruption, the size of the papules, often
its limitation to certain parts, its course and the entire or comparative
absence of itching.

It resembles urticaria at times, but the lesions of this latter disease
are evanescent, disappearing and reappearing usually in the most
capricious manner, are commonly seated about the trunk, and are
exceedingly itchy.

In the vesicular and bullous types the acute character of the outbreak,
the often segmental and ring-like shape, their frequent origin
from erythematous papules, and the distribution and association
with the more common manifestations, are always suggestive.


What prognosis would you give in erythema multiforme?

Always favorable; the eruption usually disappears in ten days to
three weeks, although in rare instances new crops may appear from
day to day or week to week, and the process last one or two months.
One or more recurrences in succeeding years are not uncommon.
Those rare cases in which vesicular or bullous lesions are also seen
on the lips and in the mouth, are more prone to longer duration and
to more frequent recurrences.


What remedies are commonly prescribed in erythema multiforme?

Quinin, and, if constipation is present, saline laxatives. Calcined
magnesia is valuable as a laxative. Intestinal antiseptics, such as
salol, thymol, and sodium salicylate, are valuable in cases probably
due to intestinal toxins. In those exceptional instances in which
there may be associated febrile action and rheumatic swelling of the
joints, the patient should be kept in bed till these symptoms
[Pg 50]
subside. Local applications are rarely required, but in those exceptional
cases in which itching or burning is present, cooling lotions of alcohol
and water or vinegar and water are to be prescribed. The vesicular
and bullous types demand mild protective applications, such as
used in eczema and pemphigus.


Erythema Nodosum.

(Synonym: Dermatitis contusiformis.)


What is erythema nodosum?

Erythema nodosum is an inflammatory affection, of an acute type,
characterized by the formation of variously-sized, roundish, more or
less elevated erythematous nodes.


Is there any special region of predilection for the eruption
of erythema nodosum?

Yes. The tibial surfaces, to which the eruption is often limited;
not infrequently, however, other parts may be involved, more especially
the arms and forearms.


Describe the symptoms of erythema nodosum.

The eruption makes its appearance suddenly, and is usually
ushered in with febrile disturbance, gastric uneasiness, malaise, and
rheumatic pains and swelling about the joints. The lesions vary in
size from a cherry to a hen's egg, are rounded or ovalish, tender and
painful, have a glistening and tense look, and are of a bright red,
erysipelatous color which merges gradually into the sound skin.
At first they are somewhat hard, but later they soften and appear as
if about to break down, but this, however, never occurs, absorption
invariably taking place. In occasional instances they are hemorrhagic.
Exceptionally the lesions of erythema multiforme are also
present. Lymphangitis is sometimes observed. In rare instances
symptoms pointing to visceral involvement, to cerebral invasion, and
to heart complications have been observed.


Are the lesions in erythema nodosum usually numerous?

No. As a rule not more than five to twenty nodes are present.


What is the course of erythema nodosum?

Acute. The disease terminating usually in one to three weeks.
[Pg 51]
As the lesions are disappearing they present the various changes of
color observed in an ordinary bruise.


What is known in regard to the etiology?

The affection is closely allied to erythema multiforme, and is, indeed,
by some considered a form of that disease. It occurs most
frequently in children and young adults, and usually in the spring
and autumn months. Intestinal toxins are thought responsible in
some cases. Digestive disturbance and rheumatic pain and swellings
are often associated with it. By many the malady is thought
to be a specific infection.


What is the pathology of erythema nodosum?

The disease is to be viewed as an inflammatory        dema, probably
resulting, in some instances at least, from an inflammation of the
lymphatics or an embolism of the cutaneous vessels.


What diseases may erythema nodosum resemble?

Bruises, abscesses, and gummata.


How are the lesions of erythema nodosum to be distinguished
from these several conditions?

By the bright red or rosy tint, the apparently violent character of
the process, the number, situation and course of the lesions.


State the prognosis of erythema nodosum.

Favorable, recovery usually taking place in ten days to several
weeks.


State the treatment to be advised in erythema nodosum.

Rest, relative or absolute, depending upon the severity of the
case, and an unstimulating diet; internally intestinal antiseptics,
quinin and saline laxatives, and locally applications of lead-water
and laudanum.


Erythema Induratum.

(Synonym: Erythema induratum scrofulosorum.)


What do you understand by erythema induratum?

A rare disease characterized in the beginning by one or more
usually deep-seated nodules, and, as a rule, seated in the legs,
[Pg 52]
especially the calf region. The nodules gradually enlarge, the skin
becomes reddish, violaceous or livid in color. Absorption may take
place slowly, or the indurations may break down, resulting in an
indolent, rather deep-seated ulcer, closely resembling a gummatous
ulcer. The disease is slow and persistent, and is commonly met
with in girls and young women, usually of strumous type. It suggests
a tuberculous origin.

Treatment consists in administration of cod-liver oil, phosphorus
and other tonics. Rest is of service. Locally antiseptic applications,
and support with roller bandage are to be advised.


Urticaria.

(Synonyms: Hives; Nettlerash.)


Give a definition of urticaria.

Urticaria is an inflammatory affection characterized by evanescent
whitish, pinkish or reddish elevations, or wheals, variable as to size
and shape, and attended by itching, stinging or pricking sensations.


Describe the symptoms of urticaria.

The eruption, erythematous in character and consisting of isolated
pea or bean-sized elevations or of linear streaks or irregular patches,
limited or more or less general, and usually intensely itchy, makes
its appearance suddenly, with or without symptoms of preceding
gastric derangement. The lesions are soft or firm, reddish or
pinkish-white, with the peripheral portion of a bright red color,
and are fugacious in character, disappearing and reappearing in the
most capricious manner. In many cases simply drawing the finger
over the skin will bring out irregular and linear wheals. In exceptional
cases this peculiar property is so pronounced and constant
that at any time letters and other symbols may be produced at will,
even when such subjects are free from the ordinary urticarial lesions
(urticaria factitia, dermatographism, autographism).

The mucous membrane of the mouth and throat may also be the
seat of wheals and urticarial swellings.


What is the ordinary course of urticaria?

Acute. The disease is usually at an end in several hours or days.
[Pg 53]


Does urticaria always pursue an acute course?

No. In exceptional instances the disease is chronic, in the sense
that new lesions continue to appear and disappear irregularly from
time to time for months or several years, the skin rarely being
entirely free (chronic urticaria).


Fig. 12.






Dermatographism. (After C.N. Davis.)

Are subjective symptoms always present in urticaria?

Yes. Itching is commonly a conspicuous symptom, although at
times pricking, stinging or a feeling of burning constitutes the chief
sensation.


In what way may the eruption be atypical?

Exceptionally the wheals, or lesions, are peculiar as to formation, or
another condition or disease may be associated, hence the varieties
known as urticaria papulosa, urticaria h       morrhagica, urticaria tuberosa,
and urticaria bullosa.


Describe urticaria papulosa.

Urticaria papulosa (formerly called lichen urticatus) is a variety in
[Pg 54]
which the lesions are small and papular, developing usually out of
the ordinary wheals. They appear as a rule suddenly, rarely in
great numbers, are scattered, and after a few hours or, more commonly,
days gradually disappear. The itching is intense, and in
consequence their apices are excoriated. Sometimes the papules are
capped with a small vesicle (vesicular urticaria). It is seen more
particularly in ill-cared for and badly-nourished young children.


Describe urticaria h       morrhagica.

Urticaria h       morrhagica is characterized by lesions similar to ordinary
wheals, except that they are somewhat hemorrhagic, partaking,
in fact, of the nature of both urticaria and purpura.


Describe urticaria tuberosa.

In urticaria tuberosa the lesions, instead of being pea- or bean-sized,
as in typical urticaria, are large and node-like (also called
giant urticaria).


What is acute-circumscribed        dema?

In rare instances there occurs, along with the ordinary lesions
of the disease or as its sole manifestation, sudden and evanescent
swelling of the eyelids, ears, lips, tongue, hands, fingers, or feet
(urticaria        dematosa, acute circumscribed        dema, angioneurotic
       dema). One or several of these parts only may be affected at the
one attack; in recurrences, so usual in this variety, the same or other
parts may exhibit the manifestation.

(These        dematous swellings occurring alone might be looked
upon, as they are by most observers, as an independent affection,
but its close relationship to ordinary urticaria is often evident.)


Describe urticaria bullosa.

Urticaria bullosa is a variety in which the inflammatory action has
been sufficiently great to give rise to fluid exudation, the wheals resulting
in the formation of blebs.


What is the etiology of urticaria?

Any irritation from disease, functional or organic, of any internal
organ, may give rise to the eruption in those predisposed. Gastric
derangement from indigestible or peculiar articles of food, intestinal
toxins, and the ingestion of certain drugs are often provocative.
The so-called        shell-fish        group of foods play an important etiological
part in some cases. Idiosyncrasy to certain articles of food is
[Pg 55]
also responsible in occasional instances. Various rheumatic and
nervous disorders are not infrequently associated with it, and are
doubtless of etiological significance. External irritants, also, in predisposed
subjects, are at times responsible.


What is the pathology of urticaria?

Anatomically a wheal is seen to be a more or less firm elevation
consisting of a circumscribed or somewhat diffused collection of semi-fluid
material in the upper layers of the skin. The vasomotor nervous
system is probably the main factor in its production; dilatation
following spasm of the vessels results in effusion, and in consequence,
the overfilled vessels of the central portion are emptied by pressure
of the exudation and the central paleness results, while the pressed-back
blood gives rise to the bright red periphery.


From what diseases is urticaria to be differentiated?

From erythema simplex, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum,
and erysipelas.


Mention the diagnostic points of urticaria.

The acuteness, character of the lesions, their evanescent nature, the
irregular or general distribution, and the intense itching.


What is the prognosis in urticaria?

The acute disease is usually of short duration, disappearing spontaneously
or as the result of treatment, in several hours or days; it
may recur upon exposure to the exciting cause. The prognosis of
chronic urticaria is to be guarded, and will depend upon the ability
to discover and remove or modify the predisposing condition.


What systemic measures are to be prescribed in acute urticaria?

Removal of the etiological factor is of first importance. This will
be found in most cases to be gastric disturbance from the ingestion
of improper or indigestible food, and in such cases a saline purgative
is to be given, probably the best for this purpose being the
laxative antacid, magnesia; or if the case is severe and food is still
in the stomach, an emetic, such as mustard or ipecac, will act more
promptly. Alkalies, especially sodium salicylate, and intestinal antiseptics
are useful. Calcium chloride in doses of five to twenty
[Pg 56]
grains should be tried in obstinate cases. The diet should be, for
the time, of a simple character.


What systemic measures are to be prescribed in chronic and
recurrent urticaria?

The cause must be sought for and treatment directed toward its
removal or modification. Treatment will, therefore, depend upon
indications. In obscure cases, quinine, sodium salicylate, arsenic,
pilocarpine, atropia, potassium bromide, calcium chloride, and ichthyol
are to be variously tried; general galvanization is at times
useful, as is also a change of scene and climate. A proper dietary
and the maintenance of free action of the bowels, preferably, as a
rule, with a saline laxative, is of great importance in these chronic
cases.

In acute circumscribed        dema treatment is essentially that of
urticaria, the diet being given special attention.


What external applications would you advise for the relief
of the subjective symptoms?

Cooling lotions of alcohol and water or vinegar and water; lotions
of carbolic acid, one to three drachms to the pint; of thymol, one-fourth
to one drachm to the pint of alcohol and water; of liquor
carbonis detergens, one to three ounces to the pint of water, or the
following:       


          Acidi carbolici, .................................       j-      iij
    Acidi borici, ....................................       iv
    Glycerin       , ...................................... f      j
    Alcoholis, ...................................... f       ij
    Aqu       , ........................................... f       xiv.   M.


Alkaline baths are also useful, and may advantageously be followed
by dusting-powders of starch and zinc oxide.


Urticaria Pigmentosa.

(Synonym: Xanthelasmoidea.)


Describe urticaria pigmentosa.

Urticaria pigmentosa is a rare disease, variously viewed as an
unusual form of urticaria and as an urticaria-like eruption in which
[Pg 57]
there is an element of new growth in the lesions. It begins usually
in infancy or early childhood and continues for months or years, and
is characterized by slightly, moderately, or intensely itchy, wheal-like
elevations, which are more or less persistent and leave yellowish,
orange-colored, greenish or brownish stains. Exceptionally subjective
symptoms are almost entirely absent. Anatomical studies
show that the lesion has in some respects the structure of an ordinary
wheal, with        dema and pigment deposit in the epidermal portion,
and cellular infiltration made up principally of mast-cells.

Fig. 13.





Urticaria Pigmentosa.


The nature of the disease is obscure and treatment unsatisfactory.
Ordinarily as early youth or adult life is reached it spontaneously
disappears. The treatment advised is usually on the same lines as
that of chronic urticaria.
[Pg 58]


Dermatitis.

What is implied by the term dermatitis?

Dermatitis, or inflammation of the skin, is a term employed to
designate those cases of cutaneous disturbance, usually acute in
character, which are due to the action of irritants.


Mention some examples of cutaneous disturbance to which
this term is applied.

The dermatic inflammation due to the action of excessive heat or
cold, to caustics and other chemical irritants, and to the ingestion of
certain drugs.


What several varieties are commonly described?

Dermatitis traumatica, dermatitis calorica, dermatitis venenata,
and dermatitis medicamentosa.


Describe dermatitis traumatica.

Under this head are included all forms of cutaneous inflammation
due to traumatism. To the dermatologist the most common met
with is that produced by the various animal parasites and from continued
scratching; in such, if the cause has been long-continued and
persistent, a variable degree of inflammatory thickening of the skin
and pigmentation result, the latter not infrequently being more or
less permanent. The inflammation due to tight-fitting garments,
bandages, to constant pressure (as bed-sores), etc., also illustrates
this class.


What is the treatment of dermatitis traumatica?

Removal of the cause, and, if necessary, the application of soothing
ointments or lotions; in bed-sores, soap plaster, plain or with
one to five per cent. of ichthyol.


What is dermatitis calorica?

Cutaneous inflammation, varying from a slight erythematous to
a gangrenous character, produced by excessive heat (dermatitis
ambustionis, burns) or cold (dermatitis congelationis, frostbite).


Give the treatment of dermatitis calorica.

In burns, if of a mild degree, the application of sodium bicarbonate,
as a powder or saturated solution, is useful; in the more severe
[Pg 59]
grade, a two- to five-per-cent. solution will probably be found of
greater advantage. Other soothing applications may also be employed.
In recent years a one-per-cent. solution of picric acid has
been commended for the slighter burns of limited extent. Upon the
whole, there is nothing yet so generally useful and soothing in these
cases as the so-called Carron oil; in some cases more valuable with
1/2 to 1 minim of carbolic acid added to each ounce.

In frostbite, seen immediately after exposure, the parts are to be
brought gradually back to a normal temperature, at first by rubbing
with snow or applying cold water. Subsequently, in ordinary chilblains,
stimulating applications, such as oil of turpentine, balsam of
Peru, tincture of iodine, ichthyol, and strongly carbolized ointments
are of most benefit. If the frostbite is of a vesicular, pustular,
bullous, or escharotic character, the treatment consists in the application
of soothing remedies, such as are employed in other like
inflammatory conditions.


What do you understand by dermatitis venenata?

All inflammatory conditions of the skin due to contact with deleterious
substances such as caustic, chemical irritants, iodoform,
etc., are included under this head, but the most common causes
are the rhus plants       poison ivy (or poison oak) and poison sumach
(poison dogwood). Mere proximity to these plants will, in some
individuals, provoke cutaneous disturbance (rhus poisoning, ivy
poisoning), although they may be handled by others with impunity.

Many other plants are also known to produce cutaneous irritation
in certain subjects; among these may be mentioned the nettle, primrose,
cowhage, smartweed, balm of Gilead, oleander, and rue.

The local action of iodoform (iodoform dermatitis) in some individuals
is that of a decided irritant, bringing about a dermatitis,
which often spreads much beyond the parts of application, and
which in those eczematously inclined may result in a veritable and
persistent eczema.


Describe the symptoms of rhus poisoning.

The symptoms appear usually soon after exposure, and consist of
an inflammatory condition of the skin of an eczematous nature,
[Pg 60]
varying in degree from an erythematous to a bullous character, and
with or without        dema and swelling. As a rule, marked itching and
burning are present. The face, hands, forearms and genitalia are
favorite parts, although it may in many instances involve a greater
portion of the whole surface.


What is the course of rhus poisoning?

It runs an acute course, terminating in recovery in one to six
weeks. In those eczematously inclined, however, it may result in
a veritable and persistent form of that disease.


How would you treat rhus poisoning?

By soothing and astringent applications, such as are employed in
acute eczema (q. v.), which are to be used freely. Among the most
valuable are: a lotion of fluid extract of grindelia robusta, one to two
drachms to four ounces of water; lotio nigra, either alone or followed
by the oxide-of-zinc ointment; a saturated solution of boric acid, with
a half to two drachms of carbolic acid to the pint; a lotion of zinc
sulphate, a half to four grains to the ounce; weak alkaline lotions;
cold cream, petrolatum, and oxide-of-zinc ointments.


How would you treat the dermatitis due to other deleterious
substances of this class?

By applications of a soothing and protective character, similar to
those used in eczema and burns.


Dermatitis Medicamentosa.


What do you understand by dermatitis medicamentosa?

Under this head are included all eruptions due to the ingestion
or absorption of certain drugs.

In rare instances one dose will have such effect; commonly, however,
it results only after several days' or weeks' continued administration.
With some drugs such effect is the rule, with others it is
exceptional, nor are all individuals equally susceptible.


How is the eruption produced in dermatitis medicamentosa?

In some instances it is probably due to the elimination of the drug
through the cutaneous structures; in others, to the action of the
drug upon the nervous system. The view that the drug acts as a
toxin or generates some toxin or irritant material in the blood, to
which the eruptive phenomena may be due, has also been advanced.







Dermatitis medicamentosa. Bullous dermatitis from iodide of
potassium.

[Pg 61]


What is the character of the eruption in dermatitis medicamentosa?

It may be erythematous, papular, urticarial, vesicular, pustular
or bullous, and, if the administration of the drug is continued, even
gangrenous.


Name the more common drugs having such action.

Antipyrin, arsenic, atropia (or belladonna), bromides, chloral,
copaiba, cubebs, digitalis, iodides, mercury, opium (or morphia),
quinine, salicylic acid, stramonium, acetanilid, sulphonal, phenacetin,
turpentine, many of the new coal-tar derivatives, etc.


State frequency and types of eruption due to the ingestion of
antipyrin.

Not uncommon. Erythematous, morbilliform and erythemato-papular;
itching is usually present and moderate desquamation
may follow. Acetanilid, sulphonal, phenacetin, and other drugs of
this class may provoke like eruptions.


Mention frequency and types of eruption due to the ingestion
of arsenic.

Rare. Erythematous, erythemato-papular; exceptionally, herpetic,
and pigmentary. Herpes zoster has been thought to follow
its use. Keratosis of the palms and soles has also been occasionally
observed, which, in rare instances, has developed into epithelioma.


Mention frequency and types of eruption due to the ingestion
of atropia (or belladonna).

Not uncommon. Erythematous and scarlatinoid; usually no febrile
disturbance, and desquamation seldom follows.


Give frequency and types of cutaneous disturbance following
the administration of the bromides (bromine).

Common. Pustular, sometimes furuncular and carbuncular and
superficially ulcerative. In exceptional instances papillomatous or
vegetating lesions have been observed. Co-administration of arsenic
or potassium bitartrate is thought to have a preventive influence in
some cases.
[Pg 62]


State frequency and types of cutaneous disturbance due to
the administration of chloral.

Occasional. Scarlatinoid and urticarial, and exceptionally purpuric;
in rare instances, if drug is continued, eruption becomes
vesicular, hemorrhagic, ulcerative and even gangrenous.


State frequency and types of eruption following the administration
of copaiba.

Not uncommon. Urticarial, erythemato-papular and scarlatinoid.


Mention frequency and types of eruption resulting from the
ingestion of cubebs.

Uncommon. Erythematous and small papular.


Fig. 14.






A somewhat rare form of eruption from the ingestion of iodine compounds.
(After J.C. McGuire.)


Mention frequency and types of eruption resulting from the
administration of digitalis.

Exceptional. Scarlatinoid and papular.


State frequency and types of eruption resulting from the
iodides (iodine).

Common. Pustular, but may be erythematous, papular, vesicular,
bullous, tuberous, purpuric and hemorrhagic. Co-administration of
arsenic or potassium bitartrate is thought to have a preventive influence
in some cases.
[Pg 63]


Give the frequency and types of eruption observed to follow
the administration of mercury.

Exceptional. Erythematous and erysipelatous.


Give the frequency and types of the cutaneous disturbance
following the ingestion of opium (or morphia).

Not uncommon. Erythematous and scarlatinoid, and sometimes
urticarial.


Mention the frequency and the types of eruption following the
administration of quinine.

Not infrequent. Usually erythematous, but may be urticarial,
erythemato-papular, and even purpuric. There is, in some instances,
preceding or accompanying systemic disturbance. Furfuraceous or
lamellar desquamation often follows.


State frequency and types of eruption resulting from the ingestion
of salicylic acid.

Not common. Erythematous and urticarial; exceptionally, vesicular,
pustular, bullous, and ecchymotic.


Give frequency and type of cutaneous disturbance due to the
administration of stramonium.

Not common. Erythematous.


State frequency and types of eruption resulting from the administration
of turpentine.

Not uncommon. Erythematous, and small-papular; exceptionally
vesicular.


X-Ray Dermatitis.


What several grades of x-ray dermatitis (x-ray burns, Rontgen-ray
burns) are observed?

Three grades are usually described: erythema, superficial vesication,
and necrosis. The first and second may come on shortly       a
few hours to several days       after exposure; occasionally later. The
third grade may present also in the first several days, but in many
cases one to several weeks may elapse before it appears; it is quite
commonly preceded by erythema and vesication. The necrosis may
be superficial or deep, and quite usually results in a persistent ulcer
covered by a leathery coating; it is usually painful.
[Pg 64]


Give the prognosis and treatment of x-ray dermatitis.

The first grade       the erythematous       usually disappears in one to
ten days; the second grade requires one to several weeks, and may
be quite sore and tender; the severe or necrotic burns are persistent,
sometimes lasting for months and several years, with little tendency
to spontaneous disappearance, and rebellious to treatment.

Fig. 15.





x-ray burn


Treatment of the milder types is that of erythema (q. v.); the
necrotic type occasionally demands thorough curetting and skin-grafting
before it will heal.


Dermatitis Factitia.

(Synonym: Feigned Eruptions.)


What do you understand by feigned eruptions?

Feigned, or artificial, eruptions, occasionally met with in hysterical
females and in others, are produced, for the purpose of exciting sympathy
or of deception, by the action of friction, cantharides, acids or
[Pg 65]
strong alkalies; the cutaneous disturbance may, therefore, be erythematous,
vesicular, bullous, or gangrenous. It is usually limited
in extent, and, as a rule, seen only on parts easily reached by the
hands.

Fig. 16.






Dermatitis Factitia       note the unusually uniform and regular character and
arrangement of the lesions.


Dermatitis Gangr       nosa.
Dermatitis Gangr       nosa.


What do you understand by dermatitis gangr       nosa?

Dermatitis gangr       nosa (erythema gangr       nosum, Raynaud's disease,
spontaneous gangrene) is an exceedingly rare affection, characterized
by the formation of gangrenous spots and patches. It
[Pg 66]
may be idiopathic or symptomatic. Some of these cases, especially
in hysterical subjects, belong under the        feigned eruptions,        being
self-produced.

As an idiopathic disease, it begins as erythematous, dark-red
spots       usually preceded and accompanied by mild or grave systemic
disturbance       which gradually pass into gangrene and sloughing; the
eventual termination may be fatal, or recovery may take place. As
a symptomatic disease, it is occasionally met with in diabetes and in
grave cerebral and spinal affections.

In Raynaud's disease (symmetric gangrene) the parts affected are
the extremities, such as fingers and toes, the ears and nose, only
occasionally other parts. The first symptoms observed are coldness
and paleness of the part; followed sooner or later by congestion of
a dark red, livid, or bluish color, with sometimes swelling, and tenderness
and shooting pains. The termination is usually in gangrene
of a dry character, with, in some instances, vesicles and blebs along
the edges; in other cases the parts become atrophied, withered, and
indurated.

Treatment is based upon general principles.


Erysipelas.


What is erysipelas?

Erysipelas is an acute specific inflammation of the skin and subcutaneous
tissue, commonly of the face, characterized by shining redness,
swelling,        dema, heat, and a tendency in some cases to vesicle- and
bleb-formation, and accompanied by more or less febrile disturbance.


Describe the symptoms and course of erysipelas.

A decided rigor or a feeling of chilliness followed by febrile action
usually ushers in the cutaneous disturbance. The skin at a certain
point or part, commonly where there is a lesion of continuity, becomes
bright red and swollen; this spreads by peripheral extension,
and in the course of several hours involves a portion or the whole
region. The parts are shining red, swollen, of an elevated temperature,
and sharply defined against the sound skin. After several
days or a week, during which time there is usually continued mild
or severe febrile action, the process begins to subside, and is followed
by epidermic desquamation.
[Pg 67]

In some cases vesicles and blebs may be present; in other cases
the disease seriously involves the deeper parts, and is accompanied
by grave constitutional symptoms. In exceptional instances sloughing
takes place.

A mild, transitory, limited, and often recurrent erysipelatous condition
of the outlet and immediate neighborhood of one or both
nostrils is met with, taking its origin from an inflammation of the
hair-follicles just inside the margin of the nose; constitutional symptoms
are usually wanting. Somewhat similar, doubtless, is the erysipelatous
inflammation (erysipeloid) observed on the fingers and
hands of butchers, etc., starting from a wound, apparently as a
result of infection from putrid meat or fish.


What is erysipelas migrans (or erysipelas ambulans)?

A variety of erysipelas which, after a few hours or days, disappears
at one region and appears at another, and so continues for one
or several weeks.


What is the cause of erysipelas?

The disease is due to a specific streptococcus       the streptococcus
of Fehleisen. Depression of the vital forces and local abrasions are
predisposing factors.


State the diagnostic points.

The character of the onset, the shining redness and swelling, the
sharply-defined border, and the accompanying febrile disturbance.


What is the prognosis in erysipelas?

In most instances the disease runs a favorable course, terminating
in recovery in one to three weeks. Exceptionally, in severe cases,
a fatal termination ensues.


What is the treatment of erysipelas?

Internally, a purge, followed by the tincture of the chloride of
iron and quinia, and stimulants if needed. Locally, one to three
per cent. carbolic-acid lotion or ointment, a saturated solution of
boric acid, or a ten- to twenty-per-cent. aqueous solution or ointment
of ichthyol may be employed.

In some cases the spread of the disease is apparently controlled
by painting the bordering healthy skin with a ring of tincture of
iodine or strong solution of nitrate of silver.
[Pg 68]


Phlegmona Diffusa.


What do you understand by phlegmona diffusa?

Phlegmona diffusa is a more or less extensive inflammation of
the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues presenting symptoms partaking
of the nature of both deep erysipelas and flat carbuncles,
and usually attended with varying constitutional disturbance. Suppuration
at several points takes place, and sloughing may ensue.
Recovery usually finally results, but a fatal issue is possible.

Treatment is based upon general principles.


Furunculus.

(Synonyms: Furuncle; Boil.)


Define furunculus.

Furunculus, or boil, is an acute, deep-seated, inflammatory, circumscribed,
rounded or more or less acuminated, firm, painful formation,
usually terminating in central suppuration.


Describe the symptoms and course.

A boil begins as a small, rounded or imperfectly defined reddish
spot, or as a small, superficial pustule; it increases in size, and when
well advanced appears as a pea or cherry-sized, circumscribed, reddish
elevation, with more or less surrounding hyper       mia and swelling;
it is painful and tender, and ends, in the course of several days or a
week, in the formation of a central slough or        core,        which finally
involves the central overlying skin (pointing). One or several may
be present, gradually maturing and disappearing. Insignificant
scarring may remain.

In some cases sympathetic constitutional disturbance is noticed.


What is a blind boil?

A sluggish boil exhibiting little, if any, tendency to point or break.


What is furunculosis?

Furunculosis is that condition in which boils, singly or in crops,
continue to appear, irregularly, for weeks or months.
[Pg 69]


State the etiology of furuncle.

A depraved state of the general health is often to be considered as
a predisposing factor. Persistent furunculosis is not infrequent in
diabetes mellitus. The immediate exciting cause is the entrance
into the follicle of a microbe, the staphylococcus pyogenes aureus.
It is not improbable, however, that boils may also be due to other
pus-producing organisms.

Workmen in paraffin oils or other petroleum products often
present numerous furuncles and cutaneous abscesses. Conditions
favoring a persistent miliaria have also a causative influence,
especially observed in infants and young children. In these
latter, especially among the poorer classes, sluggish boils or subcutaneous
abscesses about the scalp in hot weather, are not at all
infrequent.


What is the pathology of furuncle?

A boil is an inflammatory formation having its starting point in a
sebaceous-gland, sweat-gland, or hair-follicle. The core, or central
slough, is composed of pus and of the tissue of the gland in which
it had its origin.


How would you distinguish a boil from a carbuncle?

A boil is comparatively small, rounded or acuminate, and has but
one point of suppuration; a carbuncle is large, flattened, intensely
painful, often with grave systemic disturbance, and has, moreover,
several centres of suppuration.


State the prognosis.

When occurring in crops (furunculosis) the affection is often rebellious;
recovery, however, finally resulting.


What is the method of treatment of furunculus?

If there be but one lesion, with no tendency to the appearance of
others, local treatment alone is usually employed. If, however,
several or more are present, or if there is a tendency to successive
development, both constitutional and local measures are demanded.


Name the internal remedies employed.

Such nutrients and tonics as cod-liver oil, malt, quinine, strychnia,
iron and arsenic; in some instances calx sulphurata, one-tenth- to
[Pg 70]
one-fourth-grain doses every three or four hours has been thought
to be of service. Brewers' yeast has been recently again brought
forward as a remedy of value.


What is the external treatment?

Local treatment consists in the beginning, with the hope of aborting
the lesion, of the application of carbolic acid to the central portion,
or the use of a twenty-five-per-cent. ointment of ichthyol
applied as a plaster:       


          Ichthyol, ........................................       j
    Emp. plumbi, .....................................       ij
    Emp. resin       , .....................................       j.   M.


Or the injection of a five-per-cent. solution of carbolic acid into the
apex of the boil may be tried if the formation is more advanced.
If suppuration is fully established, evacuation of the contents,
followed by antiseptic applications, constitutes the best method.

A saturated solution of boric acid or a lotion of corrosive sublimate
(one to three grains to the ounce) applied to the immediate
neighborhood of the boil or boils tends to prevent the formation of
new lesions. Frequent washing of the parts with soap and water or
tincture of green soap and water is also a preventive measure of
value. In repeatedly infected areas, mild exposures to x-rays, at
intervals of a few days, will often prove of curative value.


Carbunculus.
(Synonyms: Anthrax; Carbuncle.)


What is carbuncle?

A carbuncle is an acute, usually egg to palm-sized, circumscribed,
phlegmonous inflammation of the skin and subcutaneous structures,
terminating in a slough.


At what age and upon what parts is carbuncle usually observed?

In middle and advanced life, and more commonly in men.

It is seen most frequently at the nape of the neck and upon the
upper part of the back.
[Pg 71]


What are the symptoms and course of carbuncle?

There is rarely more than one lesion present. It begins, usually
with preceding and accompanying malaise, chilliness and febrile disturbance,
as a firm, flat, inflammatory infiltration in the deeper skin
and subcutaneous tissue, spreading laterally and finally involving an
area of one to several inches in diameter. The infiltration and swelling
increase, the skin becomes of dark red color, and sooner or later,
usually at the end of ten days or two weeks, softening and suppuration
begin to take place, the skin finally giving away at several points,
through which sanious pus exudes; the whole mass finally sloughs
away either in portions or in its entirety, resulting in a deep ulcer,
which slowly heals and leaves a permanent cicatrix.

In some cases, especially in old people, constitutional disturbance
of a grave character is noted, septic       mia is developed, and a fatal
result may ensue.


What is the cause of carbuncle?

The same causes are considered to be operative in carbunculus as in
furuncle; general debility and depression, from whatever cause, predisposing
to its formation, and the introduction of a microbe, probably
the same as in furunculus, being at present looked upon as the
exciting factor.


What is the pathology?

The inflammation starts simultaneously from numerous points,
from the hair-follicles, sweat-glands or sebaceous glands. The inflammatory
centres break down, and the pus finds its way to the surface;
finally the process ends in gangrene of the whole area.


How would you distinguish carbuncle from a boil?

By its flat character, greater size, and multiple points of suppuration.


What is the prognosis of carbuncle?

Occurring in those greatly debilitated or in late life, and in those
cases in which two or more lesions exist, or when seated about the
head, the prognosis is always to be guarded, as a fatal result is not
uncommon. In fact, in every instance the disease is to be considered
of possible serious import.
[Pg 72]


What constitutional treatment is usually employed in carbuncle?

A full nutritious diet, the use of such remedies as iron, quinia, nux
vomica, with malt and stimulants, if indicated. Calx sulphurata,
one-tenth to one-fourth grain every two or three hours, appears, in
some instances, to have a beneficial effect. If the pain is severe,
morphia or chloral should be given.


What external measures are employed?

In the early part of the formation, injection of a five or ten per
cent. carbolic acid solution, or covering the whole area with a twenty-five
per cent. ichthyol ointment, may be employed. When it has
broken down the pus may be drawn out with a cupping-glass, and
carbolized glycerine or carbolized water introduced into each opening,
and the ichthyol ointment superimposed. If the whole part has
sloughed, it should be removed as rapidly as possible, and antiseptic
dressings used. Or, if its progress is slow, and grave systemic disturbance
be present, the whole part may be incised and curetted, and
then treated antiseptically. Mild exposure to the x-rays is also to be
commended.


Pustula Maligna.

(Synonyms: Anthrax; Malignant Pustule.)


What is malignant pustule?

Malignant pustule is a furuncle- or carbuncle-like lesion resulting
from inoculation of the virus generated in animals suffering
from splenic fever, or        charbon,        and is accompanied by constitutional
symptoms of more or less gravity. A fatal termination is not
unusual.


What is the cause of pustula maligna?

The disease is due to the presence of the bacillus anthracis.


What is the treatment of malignant pustule?

Early excision or destruction with caustic potash, with subsequent
antiseptic dressings; and internally the free use of stimulants and
tonics.
[Pg 73]


Post-mortem Pustule.

(Synonym: Dissection Wound.)


Describe post-mortem pustule.

Post-mortem pustule develops at the point of inoculation, beginning
as an itchy red spot, becoming vesico-pustular, and later pustular,
with usually a broad inflammatory base, and accompanied with
more or less pain and redness and not infrequently lymphangitis,
erysipelatous swelling, and slight or severe sympathetic constitutional
disturbance.


What is the treatment of post-mortem pustule?

Treatment consists in opening the pustule and thorough cauterization,
and the subsequent use of antiseptic applications or dressings.
Internally quinia and stimulants if indicated.


Framb       sia.

(Synonyms: Yaws; Pian.)


Describe framb       sia.

Framb       sia is an endemic, contagious disease met with in tropical
countries, characterized by the appearance of variously-sized papules,
tubercles, and tumors, which, when developed, resemble currants
and small raspberries, and finally break down and ulcerate. It is
accompanied by constitutional symptoms of variable severity.

Hygienic measures, good food, tonics, and antiseptic and stimulating
applications are curative.


Verruga Peruana.

(Synonyms: Peruvian Warts; Carrion's Disease; Oroya Fever.)


Describe verruga peruana.

A specific inoculable affection endemic in some valleys of the
Western Andes, in Peru, and characterized by a prodromal febrile
period and subsequent outbreak of peculiar pin-head- to pea-sized, or
larger, bright reddish, rounded, wart-like elevations. The prodromal
symptoms, of an irregular malarial or typhoid type, with associated
rheumatic and muscular pains, may last for weeks or several months,
[Pg 74]
usually abating when eruption presents. The lesions may be crowded
together in great bunches. The face and limbs are favorite localities.
The disease is inoculable and thought to be due to a bacillus.

The fatality varies between 10 and 20 per cent. Tonics and stimulants
are prescribed.


Equinia.

(Synonyms: Farcy; Glanders.)


What is equinia, or glanders?

A rare contagious specific disease of a malignant type, derived
from the horse, and characterized by grave constitutional symptoms,
inflammation of the nasal and respiratory passages, and a deep-seated
papulo-pustular, or tubercular, nodular (farcy buds), ulcerative
eruption. A fatal issue is not uncommon. It is due to a micro-organism.

Treatment, both local and constitutional, is based upon general
principles.


Miliaria.

(Synonyms: Prickly Heat; Heat Rash; Lichen Tropicus; Red Gum; Strophulus.)


What do you understand by miliaria?

An acute mildly inflammatory disorder of the sweat-glands, characterized
by the appearance of minute, discrete but closely crowded
papules, vesico-papules, and vesicles.


Describe the symptoms of miliaria.

The eruption, consisting of pin-point to millet-seed-sized papules,
vesico-papules, vesicles, or a mixture of these lesions, discrete but
usually numerous and closely crowded, appears suddenly, occurring
upon a limited portion of the surface, or, as commonly observed,
involving a greater part or the whole integument. The trunk is a
favorite locality. The papular lesions are pinkish or reddish, and
the vesicles whitish or yellowish, surrounded by inflammatory areola,
thus giving the whole eruption a bright red appearance       miliaria
rubra. Later, the areol        fade, the transparent contents of the
vesicles become somewhat opaque and yellowish-white, and the
[Pg 75]
eruption has a whitish or yellowish cast       miliaria alba. In long-continued
cases, especially in children, boils and cutaneous abscesses
sometimes develop; and it may also develop into a true eczema.

Itching, or a feeling of burning, slight or intense, is usually
present.


What is the course of the eruption?

The vesicles show no disposition to rupture, but dry up in a few
days or a week, disappearing by absorption and with slight subsequent
desquamation; the papular lesions gradually fade away, and
the affection, if the exciting cause has ceased to act, terminates.


What is the cause of miliaria?

Excessive heat. Debilitated individuals, especially children, are
more prone to an attack. Being too warmly clad is often causative.


What is the nature of the disease?

The affection is considered to be due to sweat-obstruction, with
mild inflammatory symptoms as a cause or consequence, congestion
and exudation taking place about the ducts, giving rise to papules
or vesicles, according to the intensity of the process.


How would you distinguish miliaria from papular and vesicular
eczema, and from sudamen?

The papules of eczema are larger, more elevated, firmer, slower
in their evolution, of longer duration, and are markedly itchy.

The vesicles of eczema are usually larger, tend to become confluent,
and also to rupture and become crusted; there is marked
itchiness, and the inflammatory action is usually severe and persistent.

In sudamen there is absence of inflammatory symptoms.


What is the prognosis of miliaria?

The affection, under favorable circumstances, disappears in a few
days or weeks. If the cause persists, as for instance, in infants or
young children too warmly clad, it may result in eczema.


What is the treatment of miliaria?

Removal of the cause, and in debilitated subjects the administration
of tonics; together with the application of cooling and astringent
lotions, as the following:       
[Pg 76]



          Aeidi carbolici, .................................       ss-      j
    Acidi borici, ....................................       iv
    Glycerin       , ...................................... f      j
    Alcoholis, ...................................... f       ij
    Aqu       , ............................................        xiv.   M.



This is sometimes more efficient if zinc oxide, six to eight drachms,
is added.

Lotions of alcohol and water or vinegar and water, and also the
various lotions used in acute eczema, are often employed with
relief.

Dusting-powders of starch, boric acid, lycopodium, talc, and zinc
oxide are also valuable; the following combination is satisfactory:       


          Pulv. acidi borici,
    Pulv. talci veneti,
    Pulv. zinci oxidi,
    Pulv. amyli, ..........................            .........       ij.   M.


Probably the best plan is to use a lotion and a dusting-powder
conjointly; dabbing on the wash freely, allowing it to dry, and then
dusting over with the powder.


Pompholyx.

(Synonyms: Dysidrosis; Cheiro-pompholyx.)


What is pompholyx?

Pompholyx is a rare disease of the skin of a vesicular and bullous
character, and limited to the hands and feet.


Describe the symptoms of pompholyx.

In most instances the hands only are affected. It begins usually
with a feeling of burning, tingling or tenderness of the parts,
followed rapidly by the appearance of deeply-seated vesicles, especially
between the fingers and on the palmar aspect. These beginning
lesions look not unlike sago grains imbedded in the skin. In some
instances the disease does not extend beyond this stage, the vesicles
disappearing after a few days or weeks by absorption, and usually
[Pg 77]
without desquamation. Ordinarily, however, the lesions increase in
size, new ones arise, become confluent, and blebs result, the skin in
places appearing as if undermined with serous exudation. The
parts are commonly inflamed to a slight or marked degree. The
skin comes off in flakes, new lesions may appear for several days or
two or three weeks, and the process then declines, recovery gradually
taking place.

There are no constitutional symptoms, although it is usually
noticed that the general health is below par.

What is the character of the subjective symptoms in pompholyx?

The subjective symptoms consist of a feeling of tension, burning
and tenderness, and sometimes itching. Not infrequently, also
there is neuralgic pain.


What is the cause of pompholyx?

The eruption is thought to be due to a depressed state of the
nervous system. It is more common in women, and is met with
chiefly in adult and middle life.


What is the pathology?

Opinion is divided; some considering it a disease of the sweat-glands
and others an inflammatory disease independent of these
structures.


State the diagnostic features of pompholyx.

The distribution and the peculiar characters and course of the
eruption.

It is to be differentiated from eczema.


What is the prognosis?

For the immediate attack, favorable, recovery taking place in
several weeks or a few months. Recurrences at irregular intervals
are not uncommon.


What is the treatment of pompholyx?

The general health is to be looked after, and the patient placed
under good hygienic conditions. Remedies of a tonic nature,
directed especially toward improving the state of the nervous system,
are to be prescribed. Locally, soothing and anodyne applications,
[Pg 78]
such as lead-water and laudanum, boric-acid lotion, oxide-of-zinc,
boric-acid and diachylon ointments, are most suitable; or the parts
may be enveloped with the following:       


          Pulv. ac. salicylici, ............................ gr. x
    Pulv. ac. borici,
    Pulv. amyli, ..................            .................       ij
    Petrolati, .......................................       iv.   M.


In fact, the external treatment is similar to that employed in acute
eczema.


Herpes Simplex.
(Synonym: Fever Blisters.)


What is herpes simplex?

An acute inflammatory disease, characterized by the formation of
pin-head to pea-sized vesicles, arranged in groups, and occurring for
the most part about the face and genitalia.


Describe the symptoms of herpes simplex.

In severe cases, malaise and pyrexia may precede the eruption, but
usually it appears without any precursory or constitutional symptoms.
A feeling of heat and burning in the parts is often complained of.
The vesicles, which are commonly pin-head in size, are usually upon
a hyper       mic or inflammatory base, and tend to occur in groups or
clusters. Their contents are usually clear, subsequently becoming
more or less milky or puriform. There is no tendency to spontaneous
rupture, but should they be broken a superficial excoriation
results. In a short time they dry to crusts which soon fall off, leaving
no permanent trace.


Is the eruption in herpes simplex abundant?

No. As a rule not more than one or two clusters or groups are
observed.


Upon what parts does the eruption occur?

Usually about the face (herpes facialis), and most frequently about
the lips (herpes labialis); on the genitalia (herpes progenitalis), the
[Pg 79]
lesions are commonly found on the prepuce (herpes pr       putialis) in the
male, and on the labia minora and labia majora in the female.


State the causes of herpes simplex.

Herpes facialis is often observed in association with colds and
febrile and lung diseases. Malaria, digestive disturbance, and nervous
disorders are not infrequently predisposing factors. Herpes
progenitalis is said to occur more frequently in those who have previously
had some venereal disease, especially gonorrh       a, but this is
questionable. It is probably often purely neurotic.


What are the diagnostic points?

The appearance of one or several vesicular groups or clusters about
the face, and especially about the lips, is usually sufficiently characteristic.
The same holds true ordinarily when the eruption is seen
on the prepuce or other parts of the genitalia; it is only when the vesicles
become rubbed or abraded and irritated that it might be mistaken
for a venereal sore, but the history, course and duration will
usually serve to differentiate.


Give the prognosis.

The eruption will usually disappear in several days or one or two
weeks without treatment. Remedial applications, however, exert
a favorable influence. Herpes progenitalis exhibits a strong disposition
to recurrence.


What is the treatment of herpes facialis?

Anointing the parts with camphorated cold cream, with spirits of
camphor or similar evaporating and stimulating applications will at
times afford relief to the burning, and shorten the course.


What is the treatment of herpes progenitalis?

In herpes about the genitalia cleanliness is of first importance.
A saturated solution of boric acid, a dusting-powder of calomel or
oxide of zinc, and the following lotion, containing calamine and oxide
of zinc, are valuable:       


          Zinci oxidi,
    Calamin       , ..............            ........................ gr. v
    Glycerin       ,
    Alcoholis, .............            ........................        vj
    Aqu       , ............................................        j   M.


[Pg 80]
In obstinate recurrent cases, frequent applications of a mild
galvanic current will have a favorable influence.


Hydroa Vacciniforme.

(Synonyms: Recurrent Summer Eruption; Hydroa Puerorum; Hydroa Aestivale.)


Describe hydroa vacciniforme.

It is a rare vesicular disease usually seen in boys (only two or three
exceptions), occurring upon uncovered parts, especially the nose,
cheeks, and ears. The lesions begin as red spots, discrete or in
groups, rapidly exhibit vesiculation, and later umbilication; the
contents become milky, dry to crusts, which fall off and leave small
pit-like scars. Fresh outbreaks may take place almost continuously,
and the process go on indefinitely, at least up to youth or manhood,
when the tendency subsides. Its activity is usually limited to the
warm season. Arthritic symptoms and general disturbance are
sometimes noted in severe cases.

It is doubtless a vasomotor neurosis. Exposure to sun and wind
is an important, if not essential, etiological factor. Primarily the
lesion begins in the rete middle layers, and is purely vesicular in
character; later, necrosis of the rete and extending deep in the
corium is observed.

Treatment so far has only been palliative, consisting of the applications
employed in similar conditions. Constitutional medication is
based upon general principles. The patient should avoid exposure
to the sun, strong wind and excessive artificial heat.


Epidermolysis Bullosa.


Describe epidermolysis bullosa.

This is a rare, usually hereditary, disease or condition, characterized
by the formation of vesicles and blebs on any part subjected to
slight rubbing or irritation. No scarring is left, and no pigmentation
noted. The predisposition to these lesions persists indefinitely.
The general health is not involved. The nature of the disease is
obscure.

Treatment has no influence in modifying or lessening this tendency.
The vulnerable parts should so far as possible be protected
from knocks and undue friction.
[Pg 81]


Dermatitis Repens.


What do you understand by dermatitis repens?

It is a rare spreading dermatitis starting from an injury, extending
by a serous undermining of the epidermis, and usually occurring
upon the upper extremities.

It usually begins shortly after an injury, and, as a rule, presents
itself by redness and serous exudation. The overlying epidermis
breaks, and the area of disease gradually progresses by an extension
of the serous undermining process, the denuded part looking red
and raw, with usually an oozing surface. As the disease spreads
the oldest part becomes dry and heals, the new epidermal covering
being thin and atrophic in appearance. Its most usual beginning is
on some part of the hand, and from here it may spread up the arm
and involve considerable area.

The injury from which it starts may be extremely insignificant,
apparently affording an opening for the introduction of the causative
factor, doubtless parasitic. Beyond a feeling of soreness there
seem to be no special subjective symptoms.


Give the prognosis and treatment.

The malady shows but little tendency to spontaneous cure. The
frequent or constant application of a mild antiseptic lotion, such as
boric acid and resorcin, or of a mild parasiticide ointment will generally
bring the disease gradually to an end.


Herpes Zoster.

(Synonyms: Zoster; Zona; Shingles.)


Give a definition of herpes zoster.

Herpes zoster is an acute, self-limited, inflammatory disease, characterized
by groups of vesicles upon inflammatory bases, situated
over or along a nerve tract.


Upon what parts of the body may the eruption appear?

It may appear upon any part, following the course of a nerve; it
is therefore always limited in extent, and confined to one side of the
body. It is probably most common about the intercostal, lumbar
and supra-orbital regions. In rare instances the eruption has been
observed to be bilateral.
[Pg 82]


Are there any subjective or constitutional symptoms?

Yes; there is, as a rule, neuralgic pain preceding, during and
following the eruption; and in some cases, also, there may be in the
beginning mild febrile disturbance. There is also a variable degree
of tenderness and pain.


What are the characters of the eruption?

Several or more hyper       mic or inflammatory patches over a nerve
course appear, upon which are seated vesico-papules irregularly
grouped; these vesico-papules become distinct vesicles, of size from
a pin-head to a pea, and soon dry and give rise to thin, yellowish
or brownish crusts, which drop off, leaving in most instances no permanent
trace, in others more or less scarring. In some cases the
lesions may become pustular and, on the other hand, the eruption
may be abortive, stopping short of full vesiculation.


What is known in regard to the nature of the disease?

An inflamed and irritable state of the spinal ganglia, nerve tract,
or peripheral branches is directly responsible for the eruption, and
this state may be due to atmospheric changes, cold, nerve-injuries
and similar influences. The view has also been advanced that the
disease is of specific and infectious character.


Give the chief diagnostic features of herpes zoster.

The prodromic neuralgic pain, the appearance of grouped vesicles
upon inflammatory bases following the course of a nerve tract, and
the limitation of the eruption to one side of the body.


What is the prognosis?

Favorable; the symptoms usually disappearing in two to four
weeks. In some instances, however, the neuralgic pains may be persistent,
and in zoster of the supra-orbital region the eye may suffer
permanent damage.


How would you treat herpes zoster?

Constitutional treatment, usually tonic in character, is to be based
upon general principles; moderate doses of quinia, with one-sixth
grain of zinc phosphide, four or five times daily, appear in some
cases to have a special value. The accompanying neuralgic pain
may be so intense as to require anodynes.

Local treatment should be of a soothing and protective
[Pg 83]
character. A dusting-powder of oxide of zinc and starch (to the ounce
of which twenty to thirty grains of camphor may be added) proves
useful; and over this, in order that the parts be further protected,
a bandage or a layer of cotton batting. Oxide-of-zinc ointment,
and in those cases in which there is much pain, ointments containing
powdered opium or belladonna, or orthoform, may be used. A
mild galvanic current applied daily to the parts is often of great
advantage, both in its influence upon the course of the eruption and
upon the neuralgic pain. The plan, so often advised, of painting
the parts with flexible collodion is not to be commended.

Dermatitis Herpetiformis.

(Synonyms: Hydroa Herpetiforme (Tilbury Fox); Herpes Gestationis (Bulkley); Pemphigus Prurigiuosus; Duhring's Disease.)


Give a definition of dermatitis herpetiformis.

Dermatitis herpetiformis is a somewhat rare inflammatory disease,
characterized by an eruption of an erythematous, papular, vesicular,
pustular, bullous or mixed type, with a decided disposition toward
grouping, accompanied by itching and burning sensations, with, as
a rule, more or less consequent pigmentation, and pursuing usually
a chronic course with remissions.


Describe the erythematous type of dermatitis herpetiformis.

The character of the eruption in the erythematous type resembles
closely that of erythema multiforme and of urticaria, especially the
former. The efflorescences usually make their appearance in crops,
and are more or less persistent; fading sooner or later, however, and
giving place to new outbreaks. Vesicles are often intermingled,
developing from erythematous and erythemato-papular lesions or
arising from apparently normal skin.

It may continue in the same type, or change to the vesicular, bullous
or other variety.


Describe the papular type of dermatitis herpetiformis.

This is rarely seen as consisting purely of papular lesions, but is commonly
associated with the erythematous and vesicular varieties. In
a measure it resembles the papular manifestations of erythema multiforme,
with a distinct disposition toward group formation. The
[Pg 84]
papules tend, sooner or later, to develop into vesicles, new papular
outbreaks occurring from time to time; or the whole eruption
changes to the vesicular or other type of the disease. It is not a
common type.


Describe the vesicular type of dermatitis herpetiformis.

This is the common clinical type of the disease, and is characterized
by pin-head to pea-sized, rounded or irregularly-shaped, distended
or flattened and stellate vesicles, occurring, for the most part,
in irregular and segmental groups of three or more lesions, seated
either upon apparently normal integument or upon hyper       mic
or inflammatory skin. They exhibit no tendency to spontaneous
rupture, but after remaining a shorter or longer time, are broken or
disappear by absorption. The lesions tend to appear in crops. It may,
as it not infrequently does, continue in the same type, or it may
become more or less erythematous or bullous in character. In not a
few instances pustules, few or in numbers, are at times intermingled.


Describe the pustular type of dermatitis herpetiformis.

This is rare. It is similar in its clinical characters to the vesicular
type, except that the lesions are pustular. It is met with, as a rule,
in association with the vesicular and bullous varieties of the disease.


Describe the bullous type of dermatitis herpetiformis.

The bullous expression of the disease is usually of a markedly
inflammatory nature, often innumerable blebs, small and large,
appearing almost continuously, and in some instances involving the
greater part of the surface. The lesions arise from erythematous
skin, from pre      xisting vesicles or vesicular groups, or from apparently
normal integument. There is a marked disposition to appear
in clusters. A change of type to the erythematous or vesicular
varieties is not unusual.


Describe the mixed type of dermatitis herpetiformis.

In this type the eruption is made up of erythematous patches,
vesicles, bull       , and often with pustules intermingled, appearing
irregularly or in crops, and with a tendency to patch or group formation.


Describe the characters of the vesicles, pustules and blebs.

As a rule, these several lesions, especially the vesicles and blebs,
are somewhat peculiar: they are usually of a strikingly irregular
[Pg 85]
outline, oblong, stellate, quadrate, and when drying are apt to have
a puckered appearance. They are herpetic in that they show little
disposition to spontaneous rupture, occur in groups, and are usually
seated upon erythematous or inflammatory skin       in some respects
similar to the groups of simple herpes and herpes zoster.


What is to be said in regard to the subjective symptoms?

The subjective symptoms are usually the most troublesome feature
of the disease, consisting of intense and persistent itching and a
feeling of heat and burning.


Are there any constitutional symptoms in dermatitis herpetiformis?

As a rule, not, excepting the distress and depression necessarily
consequent upon the intense itchiness and loss of sleep. In the
pustular and bullous varieties there may be mild or grave systemic
symptoms, but even in these types the constitutional involvement
is, in most instances, slight in comparison to the intensity of the
cutaneous disturbance.


What is the course of dermatitis herpetiformis?

Extremely chronic, in most instances lasting, with remissions,
indefinitely. The skin is rarely entirely free. From time to time
the type of the disease may undergo change. From the continued
irritation and scratching more or less pigmentation results.


What is to be said in regard to the etiology?

The disease is in many instances essentially neurotic, and in exceptional
instances septic       mic. Pregnancy and the parturient state are
factors in some instances (so-called herpes gestationis). It is possible
in some instances that the eruption may be an expression of a
mild toxemia of gastro-intestinal origin. In some cases no cause
can be assigned. In the majority of patients the general health,
considering the violence of the eruptive phenomena, remains comparatively
undisturbed.

Nervous shock and mental worry are factors in some cases.
Polyuria, with sugar in the urine, has occasionally been noted.
Eosinophile cells have been found both in the vesicles and the
blood. In some instances       exceptionally, it is true       the disease has
appeared shortly after vaccination.


Mention the diagnostic features of dermatitis herpetiformis.

The multiformity of the eruption, the characters of the lesions,
[Pg 86]
the disposition to grouping, the absence of tendency to form solid
sheets of eruption (as in eczema), the intense itching, history,
chronicity and course. In doubtful cases, an observation of several
weeks will always suffice to distinguish it from eczema, erythema
multiforme, herpes iris and pemphigus, diseases to which it at times
bears strong resemblance.


Give the prognosis of dermatitis herpetiformis.

An opinion as to the outcome of the disease should be guarded.
It is exceedingly rebellious to treatment, and relapses are the rule.
Exceptionally the bullous and pustular varieties prove eventually
fatal. The erythematous and vesicular varieties are the most
favorable.


State the treatment to be advised.

There are no special remedies. Constitutional treatment must be
conducted upon general principles. A free action of the bowels is
to be maintained. In occasional instances arsenic in progressive
doses seems of value. Externally protective and antipruritic applications,
such as are employed in the treatment of eczema and pemphigus,
are to be employed:       


          Ac. carbolici, ...................................       j-      ij
    Thymol, .......................................... gr. xvj.
    Glycerin       , .......................................        ss-       j
    Alcoholis, ...................................... f       ij
    Aqu       , q.s., .........ad........................... Oj.   M.


Other valuable applications are: lotions of carbolic acid, of liquor
carbonis detergens, of boric acid; alkaline baths, mild sulphur ointment
and carbolized oxide-of-zinc ointment, and dusting-powders
of starch, zinc oxide, talc and boric acid. A two- to ten-per-cent.
ichthyol lotion or ointment is sometimes of advantage; thiol employed
in the same manner has also been commended.


Psoriasis.


Give a definition of psoriasis.

Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory disease, characterized by
dry, reddish, variously-sized, rounded, sharply-defined, more or less
infiltrated, scaly patches.






Psoriasis.

[Pg 87]

At what age does psoriasis usually first make its appearance?

Most commonly between the ages of fifteen and thirty. It is
rarely seen before the tenth year, and a first attack is uncommon
after the age of forty.


Has psoriasis any special parts of predilection?

The extensor surfaces of the limbs, especially the elbows and
knees, are favorite localities, and even when the eruption is more or
less general, these regions are usually most conspicuously involved.
The face often escapes, and the palms and soles, likewise the nails,
are rarely involved. In exceptional instances, the eruption is limited
almost exclusively to the scalp.


Are there any constitutional or subjective symptoms in
psoriasis?

There is no systemic disturbance; but a variable amount of itching
may be present, although, as a rule, it is not a troublesome
symptom.


Describe the clinical appearances of a typical, well developed
case.

Twenty or a hundred or more lesions, varying in size from a pin-head
to a silver dollar, are usually present. They are sharply
defined against the sound skin, are reddish, slightly elevated and
infiltrated, and more or less abundantly covered with whitish,
grayish or mother-of-pearl colored scales. The patches are usually
scattered over the general surface, but are frequently more numerous
on the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs, especially about the
elbows and knees. Several closely-lying lesions may coalesce and a
large, irregular patch be formed; some of the patches, also, may be
more or less circinate, the central portion having, in a measure or
completely, disappeared.


Give the development and history of a single lesion.

Every single patch of psoriasis begins as a pin-point or pin-head-sized,
hyper       mic, scaly, slightly-elevated lesion; it increases gradually,
and in the course of several days or weeks usually reaches the size
of a dime or larger, and then may remain stationary; or involution
begins to take place, usually by a disappearance, partially or completely,
of the central portion, and finally of the whole patch.
[Pg 88]


Describe the so-called clinical varieties of psoriasis.

As clinically met with, the patches present are, as a rule, in all
stages of development. In some instances, however, the lesions, or
the most of them, progress no further than pin-head in size, and
then remain stationary, constituting psoriasis punctata; in other
cases, they may stop short after having reached the size of drops       
psoriasis guttata; in others (and this is the usual clinical type) the
patches develop to the size of coins       psoriasis nummularis. In
some cases there is a strong tendency for the central part of the
lesions to disappear, and the process then remain stationary, the
patches being ring-shaped       psoriasis circinata; and occasionally
several such rings coalesce, the coalescing portions disappearing and
the eruption be more or less serpentine       psoriasis gyrata. Or, in
other instances, several large contiguous lesions may coalesce and a
diffused, infiltrated patch covering considerable surface results       
psoriasis diffusa, psoriasis inveterata.

Fig. 17.






Psoriasis.

[Pg 89]


Is the eruption of psoriasis always dry?

Yes.


What course does psoriasis pursue?

As a rule, eminently chronic. Patches may remain almost indefinitely,
or may gradually disappear and new lesions appear elsewhere,
and so the disease may continue for months and, sometimes, for
years; or, after continuing for a longer or shorter period, may
subside and the skin remain free for several months or one or two
years, and, in rare instances, may never return.


Fig. 18.





Psoriasis.


Is the course of psoriasis influenced by the seasons?

As a rule, yes; there is a natural tendency for the disease to
become less active or to disappear altogether during the warm
months.
[Pg 90]


What is known in regard to the etiology of psoriasis?

The causes of the disease are always more or less obscure. There
is often a hereditary tendency, and the gouty and rheumatic diathesis
must occasionally be considered potential. In some instances it is
apparently influenced by the state of the general health. It is a rather
common disease and is met with in all walks of life.


Is psoriasis contagious?

No. In recent years the fact of its exhibiting a family tendency
has been thought as much suggestive of contagiousness as of heredity.


What is the pathology?

According to modern investigations, it is an inflammation induced
by hyperplasia of the rete mucosum; and it is beginning to be believed
that this hyperplasia may have a parasitic factor as the starting-cause.


With what diseases are you likely to confound psoriasis?

Chiefly with squamous eczema and the papulo-squamous syphiloderm;
and on the scalp, also with seborrh       a. It can scarcely be
confounded with ringworm.


How is psoriasis to be distinguished from squamous eczema?

By the sharply-defined, circumscribed, scattered, scaly patches, and
by the history and course of the individual lesions.


In what respects does the papulo-squamous syphiloderm differ
from psoriasis?

The scales of the squamous syphilide are usually dirty gray in
color and more or less scanty; the patches are coppery in hue, and
usually several or more characteristic scaleless, infiltrated papules are
to be found. The face, palms, and soles are often the seat of the syphilitic
eruption; and, moreover, concomitant symptoms of syphilis,
such as sore throat, mucous patches, glandular enlargement, rheumatic
pains, falling out of the hair, together with the history of the
initial lesion, are one, several, or all usually present.


How does seborrh       a differ from psoriasis?

Seborrh       a of the scalp is usually diffused, with but little redness
and no infiltration; moreover, the scales of seborrh       a are greasy,
dirty gray or brownish, while those of psoriasis are dry and
[Pg 91]
commonly whitish or mother-of-pearl colored. Psoriasis of the scalp
rarely exists independently of other patches elsewhere on the general
surface.

That variety of seborrh       a, commonly known as eczema seborrhoicum,
presents at times, both on scalp and general surface, a strong
resemblance to psoriasis, but the character of the scales and distribution
of psoriasis, as above stated, are distinguishing points;
seborrh       a, moreover, favors hairy surfaces and in extensive examples
the scalp, eyebrows, sternal, and pubic regions rarely escape.


How does psoriasis differ from ringworm?

By its greater scaliness, by its higher degree of inflammatory
action, and by its larger number of patches, as also by its history. In
ringworm all the patches tend to clear up in the centre; in psoriasis
this is rarely, if ever, so. If there is still any doubt, microscopic
examination of the scrapings will determine.


Give the prognosis of psoriasis.

The prognosis is usually favorable, so far as concerns the immediate
eruption, but as to recurrences, nothing positive can be stated.
In rare instances, however, the cure remains permanent.


How is psoriasis treated?

Both constitutional and local remedies are demanded in most
cases.


Do dietary measures exert any influence?

As a rule, no; but the food should be plain, and an excess of
meat avoided.


Name the important constitutional remedies usually employed
in psoriasis.

Arsenic is of first importance. It is not suitable in acute or
markedly inflammatory types; but is most useful in the sluggish,
chronic forms of the disease. The dose should never be pushed
beyond slight physiological action. It may be given as arsenious
acid in pill form, one-fiftieth to one-tenth of a grain three times
daily, or as Fowler's solution, three to ten minims at a dose.

Alkalies, of which liquor potass        is the most eligible. It is to be
given in ten to twenty minim doses, largely diluted. It is valuable
[Pg 92]
in robust, plethoric, rheumatic or gouty individuals with psoriasis of
an acute or markedly inflammatory type; it is not to be given to
debilitated or an       mic subjects.

Salicin, sodium salicylate, and salophen in moderately full doses
act well in some cases. Occasionally thyroid preparations have a
good effect.

Potassium Iodide, in doses of thirty to one hundred grains, t.d.,
acts favorably in some instances; there are no special indications
pointing toward its selection, unless it be the existence of a gouty or
rheumatic diathesis.

Oil of copaiba, potassium acetate, oil of turpentine, oil of juniper,
and other diuretics are valuable in some instances, and, while often
failing, sometimes exert a rapid influence, especially in those cases
in which the disease is extensive and inflammatory. Wine of antimony,
given cautiously, is also sometimes of service in the acute
inflammatory type in robust subjects.


Are such remedies as iron, quinine, nux vomica and cod-liver
oil ever useful in psoriasis?

Yes. In debilitated subjects the administration of such remedies
is at times attended with improvement in the cutaneous eruption.


What are the indications as regards the external measures?

Removal of the scales, and the use of soothing or stimulating
applications, according to the individual case.


How are the scales removed?

In ordinary cases, either by warm, plain, or alkaline baths, or hot-water-and-soap
washings; in those cases in which the scaling is
abundant and adherent, washing with sapo viridis and hot water
may be required. Baths of sal ammoniac, two to six ounces to the
bath are also valuable in removing the scaliness. The tincture of
green soap (tinctura saponis viridis) is especially valuable for cleansing
purposes in psoriasis of the scalp. The hot vapor bath once or
twice weekly is serviceable in keeping the scaliness in abeyance, and
has, moreover, in some cases, a therapeutic value.

The frequency of the baths or washings will depend upon the
rapidity with which the scales are reproduced.
[Pg 93]


Are soothing applications often demanded in psoriasis?

In exceptional cases; in those in which the disease is acute,
markedly inflammatory and rapidly progressing, mild, soothing applications
must be temporarily employed, such as plain or bran baths,
with the use of some bland oil or ointment. As a rule, however,
the conditions, when coming under observation, are such as to permit
of stimulating applications from the start. The most efficient soothing
applications are the mild lotions and ointments employed in
eczema of acute type.


How are the stimulating remedies employed in psoriasis applied?

As ointments, oils, and paints (pigmenta).

An ointment, if employed, is to be thoroughly rubbed in the diseased
areas once or twice daily. The same may be said of the oily
applications. The paints (medicated collodion and gutta-percha
solution) are applied with a brush, once daily, or every second or
third day, depending mainly upon the length of time the film
remains intact and adherent.


Name the several important external remedies.

Chrysarobin, pyrogallol, tar, ammoniated mercury,       -naphthol,
and resorcin.


Are these several external remedies equally serviceable in all cases?

No. Their action differs slightly or greatly according to the case
and individual. A change from one to another is often necessary.


In what forms and strength are these remedies to be applied?

Chrysarobin is applied in several ways: as an ointment, twenty
to sixty grains to the ounce, rubbed in once or twice daily; this is
the most rapid but least cleanly and eligible method. As a pigment,
or paint, as in the following:       


          Chrysarobini, ....................................       j
    Acidi salicylici, ................................ gr. xx
    Etheris, ........................................ f      j
    Ol. ricini, ......................................        x
    Collodii, ....................................... f      vij.   M.




[Pg 94]
Or it may be used in liquor gutta-perch        (traumaticin), a drachm to
the ounce. It may also be employed in chloroform, a drachm to the
ounce; this is painted on, the chloroform evaporating, leaving a thin
film of chrysarobin; over this is painted flexible collodion. If the
patches are few and large, chrysarobin rubber-plaster may be used.

Chrysarobin is usually rapid in its effect, but it has certain disadvantages;
it may cause an inflammation of the surrounding skin,
and, if used near the eyes, may give rise to conjunctivitis. As a
rule, it should not be employed about the head. Moreover, it stains
the linen permanently and the skin temporarily.

Pyrogallol is valuable, and is employed in the same manner and
strength as chrysarobin. In collodion it should at first not be used
of greater strength than three to four per cent., as in this form pyrogallol
sometimes acts with unexpected energy. It is less rapid than
chrysarobin, but it rarely inflames the surrounding integument. It
stains the linen a light brown, however, and is not to be used over
an extensive surface for fear of absorption and toxic effect. Oxidized
pyrogallic acid, a somewhat milder drug in its effect, has
been highly commended, and has the alleged advantage of being
free from toxic action.

Tar is, all things considered, the most important external remedy.
It is comparatively slow in its action, but is useful in almost all
cases. As employed usually it is prescribed in ointment form, either
as the official tar ointment, full strength or weakened with lard or
petrolatum. It may also be used as pix liquida, with equal part of
alcohol. Or the tar oils, oil of cade (ol. cadini), and oil of birch (ol.
rusci) may be employed, either as oily applications or incorporated
with ointment or with alcohol. Liquor carbonis detergens, in ointment,
one to three drachms to the ounce of simple cerate and
lanolin is a mild tarry application which is often useful. In stubborn
patches an occasional thorough rubbing with a mixture of
equal parts of liquor carbonis detergens and Vleminckx's solution,
followed by a mild ointment, sometimes proves of value. In whatsoever
form tar is employed it should be thoroughly rubbed in, once
or twice daily, the excess wiped off, and the parts then dusted with
starch or similar powder.

Ammoniated mercury is applied in ointment form, twenty to sixty
grains to the ounce. Compared to other remedies it is clean and
free from staining, although, as a rule, not so uniformly efficacious.
[Pg 95]
It is especially useful for application to the scalp and exposed parts.
It should not be used over extensive surface for fear of absorption.

      -Naphthol and resorcin are applied as ointments, thirty to sixty
grains to the ounce, and as they are (especially the former) practically
free from staining, may be used for exposed surfaces.

Gallacetophenone and aristol also act well in some cases, applied
in five- to ten-per-cent. strength, as ointments.

In obstinate patches the x-ray may be resorted to, employing it
with caution and in the same manner as in other diseases.


Pityriasis Rosea.

(Synonym: Pityriasis Maculata et Circinata.)


What do you understand by pityriasis rosea?

Pityriasis rosea is a disease of a mildly inflammatory nature, characterized
by discrete, and later frequently confluent, variously sized,
slightly raised scaly macules of a pinkish to rosy-red, often salmon-tinged,
color.


Upon what part of the body is the eruption usually found?

The trunk is the chief seat of the eruption, although not infrequently
it is more or less general.


Describe the symptoms of pityriasis rosea.

The lesions, which appear rapidly or slowly, are but slightly
elevated, somewhat scaly, usually rounded, except when several coalesce,
when an irregularly outlined patch results. At first they are
pale or bright pink or reddish, later a salmon tint (which is often
characteristic) is noticed. The scaliness is bran-like or flaky, of a
dirty gray color, and, as a rule, less marked in the central portion; it
is never abundant. The skin is rarely thickened, the process being
usually exceedingly superficial.


What course does pityriasis rosea pursue?

The eruption makes its appearance, as a rule, somewhat rapidly,
usually attaining its full development in the course of one or two
weeks, and then begins gradually to decline, the whole process occupying
one or two months.


To what is pityriasis rosea to be attributed?

The cause is not known; it is variously considered as allied to
seborrh       a (eczema seborrhoicum), as being of a vegetable-parasitic
[Pg 96]
origin, and as a mildly inflammatory affection somewhat similar to
psoriasis. It is not a frequent disease.


How is pityriasis rosea distinguished from ringworm, psoriasis
and the squamous syphiloderm?

From ringworm, by its rapid appearance, its distribution, the
number of patches, and, if necessary, by microscopic examination
of the scrapings.

Psoriasis is a more inflammatory disease, is seen usually more
abundantly upon the limbs, the scales are profuse and silvery, and
the underlying skin is red and has a glazed look; moreover, psoriasis,
as a rule, appears slowly and runs a chronic course.

The squamous syphiloderm differs in its history, distribution, and
above all, by the presence of concomitant symptoms of syphilis, such
as glandular enlargement, sore throat, mucous patches, rheumatic
pains, and falling out of the hair.


State the prognosis of pityriasis rosea.

It is favorable, the disease tending to spontaneous disappearance,
usually in the course of several weeks or one or two months.


What treatment is to be advised in pityriasis rosea?

Laxatives and intestinal antiseptics, and ointments of salicylic
acid (5-15 grains to the ounce), of sulphur (10-40 grains to the
ounce); or a compound ointment containing both these ingredients
can be prescribed. The ointment base can be equal parts of white
vaselin and cold cream; in some instances Lassar's paste (starch
powder, zinc oxid powder, each,       ij; vaselin,       iv) seems more satisfactory.


Dermatitis Exfoliativa.

(Synonyms: General Exfoliative Dermatitis; Recurrent Exfoliative Dermatitis; Desquamative Scarlatiniform Erythema; Acute General Dermatitis; Recurrent Exfoliative Erythema; Pityriasis Rubra.)


Describe dermatitis exfoliativa.

Dermatitis exfoliativa is an inflammatory disease of an acute type,
characterized by a more or less general erythematous inflammation,
in exceptional instances vesicular or bullous, with epidermic desquamation
or exfoliation accompanying or following its development.
Constitutional disturbance, which may be of a serious character, is
[Pg 97]
sometimes present. It is a rare and obscure affection, running its
course usually in several weeks or months, but exhibiting a decided
tendency to relapse and recurrence. In many cases it is persistently
chronic, with exacerbations and remissions. In some instances it
develops from a long-continued and more or less generalized eczema
or psoriasis, and in exceptional cases it is started by the careless use
of mercurial ointment and of chrysarobin ointment.

Fig. 19.






Dermatitis Exfoliativa.


In another type of the disease, formerly described as pityriasis
rubra, the skin is pale red or violaceous-red, but is rarely thickened,
continued exfoliation in the form of thin plates taking place. Its
course is variable, lasting for years, with remissions.

An exfoliating generalized dermatitis is exceptionally observed in
the first weeks of life (dermatitis exfoliativa neonatorum), lasting
some weeks, and in most cases followed by recovery. There are no
special constitutional symptoms, the fatal cases usually dying of
marasmus.

As will be seen dermatitis exfoliativa varies considerably in degree;
it may be extremely mild, resembling in appearance the scarlet-fever
eruption (erythema scarlatiniforme) and running a rapid
course; or the skin-condition and the systemic symptoms may be
of grave and persistent character.
[Pg 98]


Give the treatment of dermatitis exfoliativa.

General treatment is based upon indications, and externally soothing
applications, such as are employed in acute and subacute eczema,
are to be used.


Lichen Planus.


What is lichen planus?

Lichen planus is an inflammatory disease characterized by small,
flat and angular, smooth and shining, or scaly, discrete or confluent,
red or violaceous-red papules, having a distinctly papular or papulo-squamous
course, and attended with more or less itching.


Describe the symptoms of lichen planus.

The eruption, as a rule, begins slowly, usually showing itself upon
the extremities; the forearms, wrists and legs being favorite localities.
It may appear as one or more groups or in the form of short
or long bands. Occasionally its evolution is rapid and a considerable
part of the surface may be invaded. The lesions are pin-head to
small pea-sized, irregularly grouped or so closely crowded together
as to form solid patches; they are quadrangular or polygonal in
shape, usually flat, with central depression or umbilication, and are
reddish or violaceous in color. At first they have a glazed or shining
appearance; later, becoming slightly scaly, the scaliness being
more marked where solid patches have resulted. New papules may
appear from time to time, the older lesions disappearing and leaving
persistent reddish or brownish pigmentation. Exceptionally the
eruption presents in bands or lines, like rows of beads (lichen moniliformis).
Very exceptionally a vesicular or bleb tendency in some
of the lesions has been noted; doubtless, in most instances at least,
this has been due to the arsenic so generally administered in this
disease. In rare instances lichen planus lesions are also seen on the
glans penis and on the buccal mucous membrane. In some cases,
especially in the region of the ankle, the papules become quite large
(lichen planus hypertrophicus), and in occasional cases there is a
tendency in some of the lesions or patches to clear up centrally.
There is, as a rule, considerable itching. There are no constitutional
symptoms.


What is the etiology of lichen planus?

In some cases the disease is distinctly neurotic in character, in
others no cause can be assigned. It is more especially met with at
[Pg 99]
middle age, and among the wealthier, professional, and luxurious
classes.

Pathologically the first change noted in the epidermis is thought
to be an acanthosis, followed by epithelial atrophy, and a hyperkeratosis,
intercellular edema, and colloid degeneration of the
prickle cells.


Does the disease bear any resemblance to the miliary papular
syphilide, psoriasis, and papular eczema?

In some instances it does, but the irregular and angular outline,
the slightly-umbilicated, flattened, smooth or scaly summits, and the
dull-red or violaceous color, the history and course, of lichen planus,
will serve to differentiate.


State the prognosis.

Under proper management the eruption, although often obstinate,
yields to treatment.


What treatment would you prescribe in lichen planus?

A general tonic plan of medication is indicated in most cases, with
such remedies as iron, quinine, nux vomica, and cod-liver oil and
other nutrients. In many instances arsenic exerts a special influence,
and should always be tried. Mercurials in moderate dosage
have also a favorable action in most cases. Locally, antipruritic
and stimulating applications, such as are used in the treatment of
eczema, are to be employed, alkaline baths and tarry applications
deserving special mention. Liquor carbonis detergens, applied
weakened with several parts water, is a valuable application. In
some cases, particularly if the disease is limited, external applications
alone often suffice to bring about a cure.


Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris.

(Synonyms: Lichen Ruber; Lichen Ruber Acuminatus.)


Describe pityriasis rubra pilaris.

Pityriasis rubra pilaris is an extremely rare disease, usually of a
mildly inflammatory nature, characterized by grayish, pale-red or
reddish-brown follicular papules with somewhat hard or horny
centres; discrete and confluent, and covering a part or the entire
surface. The skin is harsh, dry and rough, feeling to the touch
somewhat like the surface of a nutmeg-grater or a coarse file. More
[Pg 100]
or less scaliness is usually present in the confluent patches and on
the palms and soles; in these latter regions the papules are rarely
seen. The duration of the disease is variable, and relapses are
common. It bears resemblance at times to keratosis pilaris, ichthyosis,
dermatitis exfoliativa; it is considered identical with the lichen
ruber acuminatus of Kaposi, and by many also with the lichen ruber
of Hebra. The etiology is obscure.

Treatment, both constitutional and local, is to be based upon
general principles; stimulating applications, with frequent baths,
such as are advised in psoriasis, are the most satisfactory. It is
rebellious, and not much more than palliation can be effected in
some cases, in others the outlook is more hopeful.


Lichen Scrofulosus.


Describe lichen scrofulosus.

Lichen scrofulosus is a chronic, inflammatory disease, characterized
by millet-seed-sized, rounded or flat, reddish or yellowish, more or
less grouped, desquamating papules. The lesions have their start
about the hair-follicles, occur usually upon the trunk, tend to group
and form patches, and sooner or later become covered with minute
scales. As a rule, there is no itching. It is a rare disease, and
but seldom met with in America; it is seen chiefly in children and
young people of a scrofulous diathesis. Scarring, slight in character,
may or may not follow.


What is the treatment of lichen scrofulosus?

The condition responds to tonics and anti-strumous remedies.


Eczema.

(Synonym: Tetter; Salt Rheum.)


What is eczema?

An acute, subacute or chronic inflammatory disease, characterized
in the beginning by the appearance of erythema, papules, vesicles or
pustules, or a combination of these lesions, with a variable amount
of infiltration and thickening, terminating either in discharge with
the formation of crusts, in absorption, or in desquamation, and
accompanied by more or less intense itching and a feeling of heat or
burning.
[Pg 101]

What are the several primary types of eczema?

Erythematous, papular, vesicular and pustular; all cases begin as
one or more of these types, but not infrequently lose these characters
and develop into the common clinical or secondary types       eczema
rubrum and eczema squamosum.


Fig. 20.





Papular Eczema (leg).

What other types are met with clinically?

Eczema rubrum, eczema squamosum, eczema fissum, eczema sclerosum
and eczema verrucosum. Eczema seborrhoicum is probably
a closely allied disease, occupying a middle position between ordinary
eczema and seborrh       a.
[Pg 102]


Describe the symptoms of erythematous eczema.

Erythematous eczema (eczema erythematosum) begins as one or
more small or large, irregularly outlined hyper       mic macules or
patches, with or without slight or marked swelling, and with more
or less itching or burning. At first it may be ill-defined, but it
tends to spread and its features to become more pronounced. It
may be limited to a certain region, or it may be more or less general.
When fully developed, the skin is harsh and dry, of a mottled, reddish
or violaceous color, thickened, infiltrated and usually slightly
scaly, with, at times, a tendency toward the formation of oozing
areas. Punctate and linear scratch-marks may usually be seen scattered
over the affected region.

Its most common site is the face, but it is not infrequent upon
other parts.

Fig. 21.





Eczema Rubrum.



What course does erythematous eczema pursue?

It tends to chronicity, continuing as the erythematous form, or
the skin may become considerably thickened and markedly scaly,
[Pg 103]
constituting eczema squamosum; or a moist oozing surface, with
more or less crusting, may take its place       eczema rubrum.

Describe the symptoms of papular eczema.

Papular eczema (eczema papulosum) is characterized by the appearance,
usually in numbers, of discrete, aggregated or closely-crowded,
reddish, pin-head-sized acuminated or rounded papules.
Vesicles and vesico-papules are often intermingled. The itching is
commonly intense, as often attested by the presence of scratch-marks
and blood crusts.

It is seen most frequently upon the extremities, especially the
flexor surfaces.

Fig. 22.






Eczema Squamosum et tissum.


What course does papular eczema pursue?

The lesions tend, sooner or later, to disappear, but are usually replaced
by others, the disease thus persisting for weeks or months;
in places where closely crowded, a solid, thickened, scaly sheet of
eruption may result       eczema squamosum.
[Pg 104]


Describe the symptoms of vesicular eczema.

Vesicular eczema (Eczema vesiculosum) usually appears, on one
or several regions, as more or less diffused inflammatory reddened
patches, upon which rapidly develop numerous closely-crowded
pin-point to pin-head-sized vesicles, which tend to become
confluent and form a solid sheet of eruption. The vesicles soon
mature and rupture, the discharge drying to yellowish, honeycomb-like
crusts. The oozing is usually more or less continuous, or the
disease may decline, the crusts be cast off, to be quickly followed by
a new crop of vesicles. In those cases in which the process is
markedly acute, considerable swelling and        dema are present.
Scattered papules, vesico-papules and pustules may usually be seen
upon the involved area or about the border.

The face in infants (crusta lactea, or milk crust, of older writers),
the neck, flexor surfaces and the fingers are its favorite localities.


What course does vesicular eczema pursue?

Usually chronic, with acute exacerbations. Not infrequently it
passes into eczema rubrum.


Describe the symptoms of pustular eczema.

Pustular eczema (eczema pustulosum, eczema impetiginosum) is
probably the least common of all the varieties. It is similar,
although usually less actively inflammatory, in its symptoms to eczema
vesiculosum, the lesions being pustular from the start or developing
from pre      xisting vesicles; not infrequently the eruption is mixed,
the pustules predominating. There is a marked tendency to rupturing
of the lesions, the discharge drying to thick, yellowish, brownish
or greenish crusts.

Its most common sites are the scalp and face, especially in young
people and in those who are ill-nourished and strumous.


What course does pustular eczema pursue?

Usually chronic, continuing as the same type, or passing into
eczema rubrum.


Describe the symptoms of squamous eczema.

Squamous eczema (eczema squamosum) may be defined as a
clinical variety, the chief symptoms of which are a variable degree
of scaliness, more or less thickening, infiltration, and redness, with
[Pg 105]
commonly a tendency to cracking or fissuring of the skin, especially
when the disease is seated about the joints. It is developed, as a
rule, from the erythematous or papular type. Itching is slight or
intense.

The disease is not uncommon upon the scalp.


What is the course of squamous eczema?

Essentially chronic.


Fig. 23.






Eczema of the Face and Scalp.


Describe the symptoms of eczema rubrum.

Eczema rubrum is characterized by a red, raw-looking, weeping,
oozing or discharging surface, attended with more or less inflammatory
thickening, infiltration and swelling; the exudation, consisting
of serum, sometimes bloody, dries into thick yellowish or reddish-brown
crusts. At one time the whole diseased area may be hidden
under a mass of crusting, at other times a red, raw-looking, weeping
surface (eczema madidans) is the most striking feature. Itching is
slight or intense, or the subjective symptom may be a feeling of
[Pg 106]
burning, It is an important clinical type, usually developing from
the vesicular, pustular or other primary variety.

It is common about the face and scalp in children, and the middle
and lower part of the leg in elderly people.


What is the course of eczema rubrum?

Chronic, varying in intensity from time to time.


Describe the symptoms of fissured eczema.

The conspicuous symptom is a marked tendency to fissuring or
cracking of the skin (eczema fissum; eczema rimosum). This tendency
is usually a part of an erythematous or squamous eczema,
the fissuring constituting the most conspicuous and troublesome
symptom. Chapping is an extremely mild but familiar example
of this type.

It is especially common about the hands and fingers.


What is the course of fissured eczema?

It is more or less persistent, the tendency to fissuring varying considerably
according to the state of the weather, often disappearing
spontaneously in the summer months.


Describe eczema sclerosum and eczema verrucosum.

In eczema sclerosum the skin is thickened, infiltrated, hard, and
almost horny. Eczema verrucosum presents similar conditions, but,
in addition, displays a tendency to papillary or wart-like hypertrophy.
In both varieties the disease is usually seated about the
ankle or the foot, developing from the papular or squamous type.
They are uncommon, and obstinately chronic.


State the nature of the subjective symptoms in eczema.

Itching, commonly intense, is usually a conspicuous symptom; it
may be more or less paroxysmal. In some cases burning and heat
constitute the main subjective phenomena.


Is eczema accompanied by febrile or systemic symptoms?

No. In rare instances, in acute universal eczema, slight febrile
action, or other systemic disturbance, may be noted at the time of
the outbreak.
[Pg 107]


Is the eczematous eruption (patch or patches) sharply defined
against the neighboring sound skin?

No. In almost all instances the diseased area merges gradually
and imperceptibly into the surrounding healthy integument.


What is the character of eczema as regards the degree of
inflammatory action?

The inflammatory action may be acute, subacute or sluggish in
character, and may be so from the start and so continue throughout
its whole course; or it may, as is usually the case, vary in intensity
from time to time.


State the character of eczema as regards duration.

As a rule, it is a persistent disease, showing little, if any, tendency
to spontaneous disappearance.


Is eczema influenced by the seasons?

Yes. With comparatively few exceptions the disease is most common
and much worse in cold, windy, winter weather.


To what may eczema be ascribed?

Eczema may be due to constitutional or local causes, or to both.
It may be considered, in fact, as a reaction of the skin tissues against
some irritant, and the latter may have its origin from within or
without.


Name some of the important constitutional or predisposing
causes.

Gouty diathesis, rheumatic diathesis, disorders of the digestive
tract, general debility or lack of tone, an exhausted state of the nervous
system, dentition and struma.


Is a constitutional cause sufficient to provoke an attack?

Yes; but often the attack is brought about in those so predisposed
by some local or external irritant.


Mention some of the external causes.

Heat and cold, sharp, biting winds, excessive use of water, strong
soaps, vaccination, dyes and dyestuffs, chemical irritants, and the
like. There is a growing belief that some cases presenting eczematous
aspects are probably parasitic in origin. In fact, some observers
hold to the microbic view of all cases of eczema.
[Pg 108]
Contact with the rhus plants, while producing a peculiar dermatitis,
usually running an acute course terminating in recovery, may,
in those predisposed, provoke a veritable and persistent eczema. In
fact, in our examination as to causes in a given case, especially of
the hands and face, all possible exciting factors should be inquired
into, such as the handling of plants, chemicals, dyes, etc.


Fig. 24.






Eczema of Face.


Is eczema contagious?

No. The acceptance of a parasitic cause for the disease, however,
necessarily carries with it the possibility of contagiousness under
favoring conditions. Such is not supported, however, by practical
experience.
[Pg 109]


What is the pathology?

The process is an inflammatory one, characterized in all cases
by hyper       mia and exudation, varying in degree according to the
intensity and duration of the disease. The rete and papillary layer
are especially involved, although in severe and chronic cases the
lower part of the corium and even the subcutaneous tissue may
share in the process.


Do the cutaneous manifestations of the eruptive fevers bear
resemblance to the erythematous type of eczema?

Scarlatina and erysipelas may, to a slight extent, but the presence
or absence of febrile and other constitutional symptoms will usually
serve to differentiate.


What common skin diseases resemble some phases of eczema?

Psoriasis, seborrh       a, sycosis, scabies and ringworm.


How would you exclude psoriasis in a suspected case of eczema
(squamous eczema)?

Psoriasis occurs in variously-sized, rounded, sharply-defined
patches, usually scattered irregularly over the general surface, with
special predilection for the elbows and knees. They are covered
more or less abundantly with whitish, silvery or mother-of-pearl colored
imbricated scales. The patches are always dry, and itching is,
as a rule, slight, or may be entirely absent. Eczema, on the contrary,
is often localized, appearing as one or more large, irregularly
diffused patches; it merges imperceptibly into the sound skin, and
there is often a history of characteristic serous or gummy oozing;
the scaling is usually slight and itching almost invariably a prominent
symptom.


How would you exclude seborrh       a (eczema seborrhoicum)
in a suspected case of eczema?

Seborrh       a of the scalp is more commonly over the whole of that
region and is relatively free from inflammatory symptoms; the scales
are of a greasy character and the itching is usually slight or nil.
On the other hand, in eczema of this region the parts are rarely
invaded in their entirety; there may be at times the characteristic
serous or gummy oozing; inflammatory symptoms are usually well-marked,
the scales are dry and the itching is, as a rule, a prominent
[Pg 110]
symptom. These same differences serve to differentiate the diseases
in other regions.


How does scabies differ from eczema?

Scabies differs from eczema in its peculiar distribution, the presence
of the burrows, the absence of any tendency to patch formation,
and usually by a clear history of contagion.


How would you exclude ringworm in a suspected case of
eczema?

Ringworm is to be distinguished by its circular form, its fading
in the centre, and in doubtful cases by microscopic examination of
the scrapings.


How does eczema differ from sycosis?

Sycosis is limited to the hairy region of the face, is distinctly a
follicular inflammation, and is rarely very itchy; eczema is diffused,
usually involves other parts of the face, and itching is an annoying
symptom.


State the general prognosis of eczema.

The disease is, under favorable circumstances, curable, some cases
yielding more or less readily, others proving exceedingly rebellious.
The length of time to bring about a result is always uncertain, and
an opinion on this point should be guarded.


Upon what would you base your prognosis in the individual
case?

The extent of disease, its duration and previous behavior, the
removability of the exciting and predisposing causes, and the attention
the patient can give to the treatment.

In eczema involving the lips, face, scrotum, and leg, and especially
when this last-named exhibits a varicose condition of the veins, a
cure is effected, as a rule, only through persistent and prolonged
treatment.


Does eczema ever leave scars?

No. Upon the legs, in long-continued cases, more or less pigmentation
usually remains.


How is eczema treated?

As a rule, eczema requires for its removal both constitutional and
external treatment.
[Pg 111]
Certain cases, however, seem to be entirely local in their nature,
and in these cases external treatment alone will have satisfactory
results.


What general measures as to hygiene and diet are commonly
advisable?

Fresh air, exercise, moderate indulgence in calisthenics, regular
habits, a plain, nutritious diet; abstention from such articles of food
as pork, salted meat, acid fruits, pastry, gravies, sauces, cheese,
pickles, condiments, excessive coffee or tea drinking, etc. As a rule,
also, beer, wine, and other stimulants are to be interdicted.


Upon what grounds is the line or plan of constitutional treatment
to be based?

Upon indications in the individual case. A careful examination
into the patient's general health will usually give the cue to the line
of treatment to be adopted.


Mention the important remedies variously employed in the
constitutional treatment.

Tonics       such as cod-liver oil, quinine, nux vomica, the vegetable
bitters, iron, arsenic, malt, etc.

Alkalies       sodium salicylate, potassium bicarbonate, liquor potass       ,
and lithium carbonate.

Alteratives       calomel, colchicum, arsenic, and potassium iodide.

Diuretics       potassium acetate, potassium citrate, and oil of copaiba.

Laxatives       the various salines, aperient spring waters, castor oil,
cascara sagrada, aloes and other vegetable cathartics.

Digestives       pepsin, pancreatin, muriatic acid and the various bitter
tonics.


Are there any remedies which have a specific influence?

No; although arsenic, in exceptional instances, seems to exert
a special action. Cod-liver oil is also of great value in some cases.

Upon the whole the most important remedies are those which
keep in view the maintenance of a proper and healthful condition
of the gastro-intestinal tract, and especially with regular and rather
free action of the bowels.
[Pg 112]

In what class of cases does arsenic often prove of service?

In the sluggish, dry, erythematous, scaly and papular types.

In what cases is arsenic usually contraindicated?

It should never be employed in acute cases; nor in any instance
(unless its action is watched), in which the degree of inflammatory
action is marked, as an aggravation of the disease usually results.

What should be the character of the external treatment?

It depends mainly upon the degree of inflammatory action; but
the stage of the disease, the extent involved, and the ability of the
patient to carry out the details of treatment, also have a bearing
upon the selection of the plan to be advised.

What is to be said about the use of soap and water in eczema?

In acute and subacute conditions soap and water are to be employed,
as a rule, as infrequently and as sparingly as possible, as
the disease is often aggravated by their too free use. Washing is
necessary, however, for cleanliness and occasionally, also, for the
removal of the crusts. On the other hand, in chronic, sluggish
types the use of soap and water frequently has a therapeutic value.

How often should remedial applications be made?

Usually twice daily, although in some case, and especially those
of an acute type, applications should be made every few hours.

Mention several remedies or plans of treatment to be used
in the acute or actively inflammatory cases.

Black wash and oxide-of-zinc ointment conjointly, the wash thoroughly
dabbed on, allowed to dry, the parts gently smeared with
ointment; or the ointment may be applied spread on lint as a plaster.

Boric-acid wash (15 grains to the ounce) and oxide-of-zinc ointment,
applied in the same manner as the above.

A lotion containing calamine and zinc oxide, the sediment drying
and coating over the affected surface:       


          Calamin       ,
    Zinci oxidi, .................            ..................        ij-       iij
    Glycerin       ,
    Alcoholis, ...................            ................. f      ss
    Liq. calcis, .................................... f       ij
    Aqu       , .............. q.s. ... ad ................ f       vj.   M.


[Pg 113]
Another excellent lotion somewhat similar to the last, but of
oily character, is made up of three drachms each of calamine
and zinc oxide, one drachm of boric acid, ten to thirty drops of
carbolic acid, and three ounces each of lime-water and oil of sweet
almonds.

Carbolic-acid lotion, about two drachms to the pint of water, to
which may be added two or three drachms each of glycerin and
alcohol; or, if there is intense itching, carbolic acid may be added
to the several washes already mentioned.

A lotion made of one or two drachms of liquor carbonis detergens[A]
to four ounces of water.

The following wash, especially in the dry form of the disease:       


          Ac. borici, ......................................       iv
    Ac. carbolici, ...................................       j
    Glycerin       , .......................................       ij
    Alcoholis, .......................................       ij
    Aqu       , ............... q.s. ad. ................... Oj.  M.


[A] Liquor carbonis detergens is made by mixing together nine ounces
of tincture soap bark and four ounces of coal tar, allowing to digest for
eight days, and filtering. The tincture of soap bark used is made with
one pound of soap bark to one gallon of 95 per cent. alcohol, digesting
for a week or so. Instead of the proprietary name above, Prof. Duhring
has suggested that of tinctura picis mineralis comp.

Dusting-powders, of starch, zinc oxide and Venetian talc, alone or
severally combined, applied freely and often, so as to afford protection
to the inflamed surface:       


          Talci venet,
    Zinci oxidi, ...............            ....................       iv
    Amyli, ...........................................        j.   M.


If washes or dusting-powders should disagree or are not desirable
or practicable, ointments may be employed, such as       

Oxide-of-zinc ointment, cold cream, petrolatum, plain or carbolated,
diachylon ointment (if fresh and well prepared), and a paste-like[Pg 114]
ointment, as the following, usually called        salicylic-acid paste       ;
in markedly itchy cases, five to fifteen grains of carbolic may be
added to each ounce:



          Ac. salicylici, .................................. gr. v-x
    Pulv. amyli,
    Pulv. zinci oxidi, ...............            ..............       ij
    Petrolati, .......................................       iv   M.



Or the following ointment:       


          Calamin       , ........................................       j
    Ungt. zinci oxidi, ...............................       vij.   M.



Name several external remedies and combinations useful in
eczema of a subacute or mildly inflammatory type.

The various remedies and combinations useful when the symptoms
are acute or markedly inflammatory (mentioned above), and more
especially the several following:       


          Zinci oxidi, .....................................       ij
    Liq. plumbi subacetat. dilut., .................. f      vj
    Glycerin       , ...................................... f      ij
    Infus. picis liq., .............................. f       iij   M.


A lotion containing resorcin, five to thirty grains to the ounce.

Solution of zinc sulphate, one-half to three grains to the ounce.

An ointment containing calomel or ammoniated mercury, as in
the annexed formula:       


          Hydrargyri ammoniat. seu Hydrargyri
      chloridi mit., ................................. gr. x-xxx
    Ac. carbolici, ................................... gr. v-x
    Ungt. zinci oxidi, ...............................        j.   M.


Another formula, more especially useful in eczema of the hands
and legs, is the following:       
[Pg 115]


          Ac. salicylici, .................................. gr. xxx
    Emp. plumbi,
    Emp. saponis,
    Petrolati, ...................            ..................        j.   M.


(This is to be applied as a plaster, spread on strips of lint, and
changed every twelve or twenty-four hours.)

The paste-like ointment, referred to as useful in acute eczema,
may also be used with a larger proportion (20 to 60 grains to the
ounce) of salicylic acid.

The following, containing tar, may often be employed with advantage:       


          Ungt. picis liq., ................................       j
    Ungt. zinci oxidi, ...............................       vij.   M.



What is to be said in regard to the use of tarry applications?

Ointments or lotions containing tar should always be tried at first
upon a limited surface, as occasionally skins are met with upon
which this remedy acts as a more or less violent irritant. The coal
tar lotion (liquor carbonis detergens) is the least likely to disagree
and may be used as a mild ointment, one or two drachms to the
ounce, or it may be diluted and used as a weak lotion as already
referred to.


What external remedies are to be employed in eczema of a
sluggish type?

The various remedies and combinations (mentioned above) useful
in acute and subacute eczema may often be employed with
benefit, but, as a rule, stronger applications are necessary, especially
in the thick and leathery patches. The following are the
most valuable:       

An ointment of calomel or ammoniated mercury; forty to sixty
grains to the ounce.

Strong salicylic-acid ointment; a half to one drachm of salicylic
acid to the ounce of lard.

Tar ointment, official strength; or the various tar oils, alone or
with alcohol, as a lotion, or in ointment form.
[Pg 116]


Liquor picis alkalinus[B] is a valuable remedy in chronic thickened,
hard and verrucous patches, but is a strong preparation and must be
used with caution. It is applied diluted, one part with from eight
to thirty-two parts of water; or in ointment, one or two drachms to
the ounce. In such cases, also, the following is useful:       


          Saponis viridis,
    Picis liq.,
    Alcoholis, ....................            .................       iij.   M.
  SIG. To be well rubbed in.


[B]



          Potass        ,.........................................       j
    Picis liq., ......................................       ij
    Aqu       , ............................................       v.



Dissolve the potash in the water, and gradually add to the tar in a
mortar, with thorough stirring.

In similar cases, also, the parts may be thoroughly washed or
scrubbed with sapo viridis and hot water until somewhat tender,
rinsed off, dried, and a mild ointment applied as a plaster.

Lactic acid, applied with one to ten or more parts of water is also
of value in the sclerous and verrucous types. Caustic potash solutions,
used cautiously, may also be occasionally employed to advantage
in these cases.

Another remedy of value in these cases, as well as in others
of more or less limited nature, is the x-ray. Exposures every
few days, of short duration and 4 to 10 inches distance, with
medium vacuum tube. This method has served me well in
occasional cases; caution is necessary, and it should not be
pushed further than the production of the mildest reaction. The
repeated application of a high-frequency current, by means of the
vacuum electrodes, is a safer and sometimes an equally beneficial
method.


Is there any method of treating eczema with fixed dressings?

Several plans have been advised from time to time; some are costly,
and some require too great attention to details, and are therefore
impracticable for general employment. The following are those in
more common use:       

The gelatin dressing, as originally ordered, is made by melting over[Pg 117]
a water-bath one part of gelatin in two parts of water       quickly painting
it over the diseased area; it dries rapidly, and to prevent cracking
glycerine is brushed over the surface. Or the glycerine may
be incorporated with the gelatin and water in the following proportion:
glycerine, one part; gelatin, four parts, and water eight parts.
Medicinal substances may be incorporated with the gelatin mixture.

A good formula is the following:       


          Gelatin, .........................................        j
    Zinci oxidi, .....................................        ss
    Glycerini, .......................................        iss
    Aqu       , ............................................        ii-       iij.


This should be prepared over a water-bath, and two per cent.
ichthyol added. A thin gauze bandage can be applied to the
parts over which this dressing is painted, before it is completely
dry; it makes a comfortable fixed dressing and may remain on
several days.

Plaster-mull and gutta-percha plaster. The plaster-mull, consisting
of muslin incorporated with a layer of stiff ointment, and the
gutta-percha plaster, consisting of muslin faced with a thin layer
of India-rubber, the medication being spread upon the rubber
coating.

Rubber plasters. These are medicated with the various drugs
used in the external treatment of skin diseases, and are often of
service in chronic patches.

Two new excipients for fixed dressings have recently been introduced       bassorin
and plasment; the former is made from gum tragacanth,
and the latter from Irish moss.

The following is a satisfactory formula for a tragacanth dressing:


          Tragacanth, ...................................... gr. lxxv
    Glycerini, .......................................         xxx
    Ac. carbolici, ................................... gr. x-xx
    Zinci oxidi, .....................................       iss-      iiss.   M.


This is painted over the parts and allowed to dry, and a mild dusting
powder sprinkled over. It cannot be used in warm weather
or in folds, as it is apt to get sticky. The following is a bassorin
paste which may be variously medicated.
[Pg 118]


          Bassorin, ........................................       x
    Dextrin, .........................................       vj
    Glycerini, .......................................        ij.
    Aqu       , ................................... q.s. ad.        iij.


It should be prepared cold.

Another        drying dressing        which may be used in cool weather is:


          Zinci oxidi, .....................................        j
    Glycerini, .......................................        ss
    Mucilag. acaci       , .................................        ii-       iv.


It may be variously medicated.

The plaster-mull is used in all types, especially the acute; the gelatin
dressing, and the gutta-percha plaster, in the subacute and
chronic; and the rubber plaster in chronic, sluggish patches only.
Acacia, tragacanth, bassorin and plasment applications are used in
cases of a subacute and chronic character.


Prurigo.


Define prurigo.

Prurigo is a chronic, inflammatory disease, characterized by discrete,
pin-head- to small pea-sized, solid, firmly-seated, slightly
raised, pale-red papules, accompanied by itching and more or less
general thickening of the affected skin.


Describe the symptoms and course of prurigo.

The disease first appears upon the tibial regions, and its earliest
manifestation may be urticarial, but there soon develop the characteristic
small, millet-seed-sized, or larger, firm elevations, which
may be of the natural color of the skin or of a pinkish tinge. The
lesions, whilst discrete, are in great numbers, and closely crowded.
The overlying skin is dry, rough and harsh; itching is intense, and,
as a result of the scratching, excoriations and blood crusts are commonly
present. In consequence of the irritation, the inguinal glands
are enlarged. Sooner or later the integument becomes considerably
thickened, hard and rough. Eczematous symptoms may be superadded.
In severe cases the entire extensor surfaces of the legs and
arms, and in some instances the trunk also, are invaded. It is
worse in the winter season.
[Pg 119]


What is known in regard to etiology and pathology?

It is a disease of the ill-fed and neglected, usually developing in
early childhood, and persisting throughout life. It is extremely rare,
even in its milder types, in this country. Clinically and pathologically
it bears some resemblance to papular eczema.


Give the prognosis and treatment of prurigo.

The disease, in its severer types is, as a rule, incurable, but much
can be done to alleviate the condition. Good, nourishing food, pure
air and exercise are of importance. Tonics and cod-liver oil are
usually beneficial. The local management is similar to that employed
in chronic eczema. An ointment of       -naphthol, one-half to five
per cent. strength, is highly extolled.


Acne.


Give a definition of acne.

Acne is an inflammatory, usually chronic, disease of the sebaceous
glands, characterized by papules, tubercles, or pustules, or a mixture
of these lesions, and seated usually about the face.


At what age does acne usually occur?

Between the ages of fifteen and thirty, at which time the glandular
structures are naturally more or less active.


Describe the symptoms of acne.

Irregularly scattered over the face, and in some cases also over the
neck, shoulders and upper part of the trunk, are to be seen several,
fifty or more, pin-head- to pea-sized papules, tubercles or pustules;
commonly the eruption is of a mixed type (acne vulgaris), the several
kinds of lesions in all stages of evolution and subsidence presenting in
the single case. Interspersed may generally be seen blackheads, or
comedones. The lesions may be sluggish in character, or they may
be markedly inflammatory, with hard and indurated bases. In the
course of several days or weeks, the papules and tubercles tend
gradually to disappear by absorption; or, and as commonly the case,
they become pustular, discharge their contents, or dry and slowly
or rapidly disappear, with or without leaving a permanent trace,
new lesions arising, here and there, to take their place. In exceptional
instances the eruption is limited to the back, and in these
[Pg 120]
cases the eruption is usually extensive and persistent, and not infrequently
leaves scars.


What do you understand by acne punctata, acne papulosa,
acne pustulosa, acne indurata, acne atrophica, acne
hypertrophica, and acne cachecticorum?

These several terms indicate that the lesions present are, for the
most part, of one particular character or variety.


Describe the lesions giving rise to the names of these various
types.

Blocking up of the outlet of the sebaceous gland (comedo), which is
usually the beginning of an acne lesion, may cause a moderate degree
of hyper       mia and inflammation, and a slight elevation, with a central
yellowish or blackish point results       the lesion of acne punctata;
if the inflammation is of a higher grade or progresses, the elevation
is reddened and more prominent       acne papulosa; if the inflammatory
action continues, the interior or central portion of the papule suppurates
and a pustule results       acne pustulosa; the pustule, in some
cases, may have a markedly inflammatory and hard base       acne indurata;
and not infrequently the lesions in disappearing may leave a
pit-like atrophy or depression       acne atrophica; or, on the contrary,
connective-tissue new growth may follow their disappearance       acne
hypertrophica; and, in strumous or cachectic individuals, the lesions
may be more or less furuncular in type, often of the nature of dermic
abscesses, usually of a cold or sluggish character, and of more general
distribution       acne cachecticorum.


What is acne artificialis?

Acne artificialis is a term applied to an acne or acne-like eruption
produced by the ingestion of certain drugs, as the bromides and
iodides, and by the external use of tar; this is also called tar acne.


What course does acne pursue?

Essentially chronic. The individual lesions usually run their course
in several days or one or two weeks, but new lesions continue to appear
from time to time, and the disease thus persists, with more or
less variation, for months or years. In many cases there is, toward
the age of twenty-five or thirty, a tendency to spontaneous disappearance
of the disease.






Acne

[Pg 121]


Is the eruption in acne usually abundant?

It varies in different cases and at different periods in the same
case. In some instances, not more than five or ten papules and
pustules are present at one time; in others they may be numerous.
Not infrequently several lesions make their appearance, gradually
run their course, and the face continues free for days or one or two
weeks.


Does the eruption in acne disappear without leaving a trace?

In many instances no permanent trace remains, but in others
slight or conspicuous scarring is left to mark the site of the lesions.


Are there any subjective symptoms in acne?

As a rule, not; but markedly inflammatory lesions are painful.


State the immediate or direct cause of an acne lesion.

Hypersecretion or retention of sebaceous matter. Recent investigations
point to the possibility of a special bacillus being the exciting
cause, in some instances at least. The pyogenic cocci are added
factors in the pustular and furuncular cases.


Name the indirect or predisposing causes of acne.

Digestive disturbance, constipation, menstrual irregularities, chlorosis,
general debility, lack of tone in the muscular fibres of the skin,
scrofulosis; and medicinal substances such as the iodides and bromides
internally, and tar externally.

Working in a dusty or dirty atmosphere is often influential, resulting
in a blocking-up of the gland ducts. Workmen in paraffin oils
or other petroleum products often present a furuncle-like acne.

The disease is more common in individuals of light complexion.


Is there any difficulty in the diagnosis of acne?

Not if it be remembered that acne eruption is limited to certain
parts and is always follicular, and that the several stages, from the
comedo to the matured lesion, are usually to be seen in the individual
case.


In what respect does the pustular syphiloderm differ from
acne?

By its general distribution, the longer duration of the individual
lesions, the darker color, and the presence of concomitant symptoms
of syphilis.
[Pg 122]


What is the pathology of acne?

Primarily, acne is a folliculitis, due to retention or decomposition
of the sebaceous secretion or to the introduction of a micro-organism;
subsequently, the tissue immediately surrounding becoming
involved, with the possible destruction of the sebaceous follicle as a
result. The degree of inflammatory action determines the character
of the lesions.


State the prognosis of acne.

It is usually an obstinate disease, but curable. Some cases yield
readily, others are exceedingly rebellious, especially acne of the
back. Success depends in a great measure upon a recognition and
removal of the predisposing condition. Treatment is ordinarily a
matter of months.


What measures of treatment are usually demanded in acne?

Constitutional and local measures; the former when indicated,
the latter always.


Upon what is the constitutional treatment based?

Upon indications. Diet and hygienic measures are important.

In dyspepsia and constipation, bitter tonics, alkalies, acids, pepsin,
saline and vegetable laxatives, are variously prescribed. Special
mention may be made of the following:       


          Ext. rhamni pursh. fl., ......................... f      ij-f      iv
    Tinct. nucis vom., .............................. f      iij
    Tinct. cardamomi comp., ................. q.s. ad.        iij.   M.
  SIG.       f       t.d.


Or Hunyadi Janos or Friedrichshall water may be employed for a
laxative purpose.

In chlorotic and an       mic cases the ferruginous preparations are of
advantage. Cod-liver oil is often a remedy of great value, and is
especially useful in strumous and debilitated subjects. Calx sulphurata
in pill form, one-tenth to one-fourth grain four or five times
daily, is said, acts well in the pustular variety. In some instances,
more particularly in sluggish papular acne, arsenic, especially the
sulphide of arsenic, acts favorably. Upon the whole, the line of






Acne of back[Pg 123]

treatment that keeps in view proper and healthy action of the gastro-intestinal
canal is the most successful.

In inflammatory cases occurring in robust individuals the following
is often of service:       


          Potassii acetat., ................................       iv
    Liq. potass       , ................................... f      ij
    Liq. ammonii acetat., ............ q.s. ad. ..... f       iij.   M.
  SIG.       f      j-f      ij t.d., largely diluted.



State the character of the local treatment in acne.

This must vary somewhat with the local conditions. Cases which
are acute in character, in the sense that the lesions are markedly
hyper       mic, tender and painful, require milder applications, and in
exceptional instances soothing remedies are to be prescribed. As a
rule, however, stimulating applications may be employed from the
start.

The remedies are, for obvious reasons, most conveniently applied
at bedtime.


What preliminary measures are to be advised in ordinary
acne cases?

Washing the parts gently or vigorously, according to the irritability
of the skin, with warm water and soap; subsequently rinsing,
and sponging for several minutes with hot water, and rubbing dry
with a soft towel; after which the remedial application is made. In
sluggish and non-irritable cases sapo viridis or its tincture may often
be advantageously used in place of the ordinary toilet soap.

The blackheads, so far as practicable, are to be removed by pressure
with the fingers or with a suitable instrument (see Comedo), and
the superficial pustules punctured and the contents pressed out.
Scraping the affected parts with a blunt curette is a valuable measure,
but is temporarily disfiguring. As a rule, however, cases do
just as well without puncturing and scraping, and these methods
sometimes leave behind scarring.


State the methods of external medication commonly employed.

By ointments and lotions. If an ointment is used, it is to be
thoroughly rubbed in, in small quantity; if a lotion is employed, it
[Pg 124]
is to be well shaken, the parts freely dabbed with it for several
minutes and then allowed to dry on.


State the object in view in local medication.

To hasten the maturation and disappearance of the existing
lesions, and to stimulate the skin and glands to healthy action.

If slight irritation or scaliness results, the application is to be
intermitted one or two nights; in the meantime nothing except
the hot-water sponging, with or without the application of a mild
soothing ointment, is to be employed.


Is it usually necessary to change from one external remedy
to another in the course of treatment?

Yes. After a certain time one remedy, as a rule, loses its effect,
and a change from lotion to ointment or the reverse, and from one
lotion or ointment to another, will often be found necessary in order
to bring about continuous improvement.


Name the various important remedies and combinations employed
in the external treatment of acne.

Sulphur is the most valuable. It may often be applied with benefit
as a simple ointment:       


          Sulphur, pr       cip., ................................       ss-      j
    Adipis benz.
    Lanolin, .....................            ..................       ij.


Or it may be used as a lotion, as in the annexed formula:       


          Sulphur, pr       cip., ................................       iss
    Pulv. tragacanth       , ............................... gr. x1
    Pulv. camphor       , .................................. gr. xx
    Liq. calcis,........ q.s. ad. ................... f       iv.   M.


Another lotion, especially useful in those cases in which an oily
condition of the skin is present, is the following:       


          Sulphur, pr       cip., ................................       iss
    Etheris, ........................................ f      iv
    Alcoholis, ...................................... f       iijss.   M.


A compound lotion containing sulphur in one of its combinations
is also valuable in many cases:       
[Pg 125]


          Zinci sulphatis,
    Potassii sulphureti, ................            ...........       ss-      iv
    Aqu       , ............................................        iv.   M.


(The salts should be dissolved separately and then mixed; reaction
takes place and the resulting lotion, when shaken, is milky in appearance,
and free from odor; allowed to stand the particles settle, the
sediment constituting about one-fourth to three-fourths of the whole
bulk).

At times the addition to this formula of several drachms of alcohol
and of five to ten minims of glycerin is of advantage.

An external remedy, often valuable, is ichthyol. It is thus prescribed:       


          Ichthyol, ........................................       ss-      j
    Cerat. simp., ....................................       iv.   M.


The various mercurial ointments, especially one of white precipitate,
five to fifteen per cent. strength, are sometimes beneficial.

A compound lotion, containing mercury, which frequently proves
serviceable, is:       


          Hydrarg. chlorid. corros., ....................... gr. ii-viij
    Zinci sulphatis, ................................. gr. x-xx
    Tinct. benzoini, ................................ f      ij
    Aqu       , ................... q.s. ad. .............. f       iv.


In extremely sluggish cases the following, used cautiously, is of
value:       


          Ichthyol,
    Saponis viridis,
    Sulphur, pr       cip.,
    Lanolin, .......................            ................       j.


In such instances the application of a strong alcoholic resorcin
lotion, ten to twenty-five per cent. strength, repeated several times
daily till marked irritation and exfoliation occur (a matter usually
of one to three days), will sometimes be followed by marked improvement.
Acne of the back is treated with the same applications,
but usually stronger; in this region applications of Vleminckx's
[Pg 126]
solution and formaldehyde solution, weakened considerably, at first
at least, prove of value.

Obstinate and indurated lesions may be incised, the contents
pressed out, and the interior touched with carbolic acid by means
of a pointed stick. The x-ray has proved a most valuable addition
to our resources in the treatment of acne, and is especially serviceable
in extensive and obstinate cases. An exposure should be made
about twice weekly, at a distance of five to ten inches and for from
three to ten minutes, and a tube of medium vacuum used. It must
be used with great caution and never beyond the production of the
mildest erythema. The hair, eyes, and lips should be protected.
The x-ray treatment is best reserved for obstinate cases, and then
used mildly, and rather as an adjuvant to the ordinary methods than
as the sole measure.


What precaution is to be taken in advising a change from a
sulphur to a mercurial preparation or the reverse?

Several days should be allowed to intervene, otherwise a disagreeable,
although temporary, staining or darkening of the skin results       from
the formation of the black sulphuret of mercury.


Acne Rosacea.


Give a descriptive definition of acne rosacea.

Acne rosacea is a chronic, hyper       mic or inflammatory disease,
limited to the face, especially to the nose and cheeks, characterized
by redness, dilatation and enlargement of the bloodvessels, more or
less acne and hypertrophy.


Describe the symptoms of acne rosacea.

The disease may be slight or well-marked. Redness, capillary
dilatation, and acne lesions seated on the nose and cheeks, and sometimes
on chin and forehead also, constitute in most cases the entire
symptomatology.

A mild variety consists in simple redness or hyper       mia, involving
the nose chiefly and often exclusively, and is to be looked upon as a
passive congestion; this is not uncommon in young adults and is
often associated with an oily seborrh       a of the same parts. In many
[Pg 127]
cases the condition does not progress beyond this stage. In other
cases, however, sooner or later the dilated capillaries become permanently
enlarged (telangiectasis) and acne lesions are often present       
constituting the middle stage or grade of the disease; this is the
type most frequently met with. In exceptional instances, still further
hypertrophy of the bloodvessels ensues, the glands are enlarged,
and a variable degree of connective-tissue new growth is added; this
latter is usually slight, but may be excessive, the nose presenting an
enlarged and lobulated appearance (rhinophyma).

Fig. 25.





Acne Rosacea.


[Pg 128]


Are there any subjective symptoms in acne rosacea?

As a rule, no. Some of the acne lesions may be tender and painful,
and at times there is a feeling of heat and burning.


What do you know in regard to the etiology?

In many cases the causes are obscure. Chronic digestive and intestinal
disorders, an       mia, chlorosis, continued exposure to heat or
cold, menstrual and uterine irregularities, and the too free use of
spirituous liquors, tea, etc. are often responsible factors.

It is essentially a disease of adult life, common about middle age,
occurring in both sexes, but rarely reaching the same degree of development
in women as observed at times in men.


Is acne rosacea easily recognized?

Yes. The redness, acne lesions, dilated capillaries, and, at times,
the glandular and connective-tissue hypertrophy; the limitation of
the eruption to the face, especially the region of the nose; the evident
involvement of the sebaceous glands, the absence of ulceration, taken
with the history of the case, are characteristic.

It is to be distinguished from the tubercular syphiloderm and
lupus vulgaris, diseases to which it may bear rough resemblance.


State the prognosis of acne rosacea.

All cases may be favorably influenced by treatment; the mild
and moderately-developed types are, as a rule, curable, but usually
obstinate. It is a persistent disease, showing little, if any, tendency
to disappear spontaneously.


What is the method of treatment?

Both constitutional and local measures are demanded in most
cases.


Upon what is the constitutional treatment to be based?

The constitutional treatment, beyond a regulation of the diet, is
to be based upon a correct appreciation of the etiological factors in
the individual case. There are no special remedies. Iron, cod-liver
oil, tonics, ergot, alkalies, saline laxatives, and similar drugs are to
be variously prescribed.


What is the external treatment?

In many respects, both as to the preliminary measures and remedies,
[Pg 129]
essentially the same as that employed in the treatment of simple
acne (q. v.). The x-ray treatment is not so efficient in this disease,
however, as in acne. In addition to the treatment there found,
several other applications deserve mention:       

In many cases Vleminckx's solution[C] is valuable, applied diluted
with one to ten parts of water. Also, a mucilaginous paste containing
sulphur:       


          Mucilag. acaci       , ................................ f      iij
    Glycerin       , ...................................... f      ij
    Sulphur, pr       cip., ................................       iij.   M.


[C]



          Calcis, ..........................................        ss
    Sulph. sublimat., ................................        j
    Aqu       , ............................................        x.



To be boiled down to        vj and filtered.

Or a similar paste with the glycerine in the foregoing replaced with
ichthyol may be used.


In what manner are the dilated bloodvessels and connective-tissue
hypertrophy to be treated?

The enlarged capillaries are to be destroyed by incision or by electrolysis.
Properly managed the vessels may be thus destroyed, but
unless the predisposing causes have disappeared or have been remedied,
a new growth may take place.

If the knife is employed, the vessels are either slit in their length
or cut transversely at several points. The method by electrolysis is
the same as used in the removal of superfluous hair (q. v.).; the
needle may, if the vessel is short, be inserted along its calibre, or if
long, may be inserted at several points in its length.

Excessive connective-tissue growth, exceptionally met with, is to
be treated by ablation with the scissors or knife.


Acne Varioliformis.

(Synonyms: Acne Frontalis; Acne Rodens; Acne Necrotica; Lupoid Acne;
Necrotic Granuloma.)


Describe acne varioliformis.

Acne varioliformis is characterized by lesions of a moderately
superficial papulo-pustular type, which in disappearing leave slight or [Pg 130]
well-marked pit-like scars. The forehead and scalp are the favorite
sites, but they may also occur elsewhere. The eruption is rather
scanty as a rule, consisting usually of ten to thirty lesions. They
begin as small maculo-papules, as papules, or as minute nodules in
or on the skin, and gradually become small pea-sized, with a tendency
to slight vesiculation or pustulation at the central part. The
lesion is sluggish in its course, drying to a thin crust, which finally
falls off, leaving a depressed variola-like scar. New lesions arise
from time to time, and the disease thus continues almost indefinitely.
There may or may not be itching. In what appears to be a variety
of this disease, known usually as acne urticata, there is considerable
itching just at the time the lesion is appearing. The malady is not
frequent, but occurs in both sexes, usually in those between the ages
of twenty and fifty. It seems probable that the eruption is parasitic
in origin.

The maladies variously known as hydradenitis suppurativa, acnitis,
spiradenitis, folliclis, granuloma necroticum, etc., in which the lesions,
primarily at least, are somewhat deeper seated, sluggish in their
course, and followed by scarring, could be also included under this
head.

Give the prognosis and treatment.

The disease is rebellious and tends to recur. The most efficient
applications are those of sulphur and resorcin, the same as prescribed
in ordinary acne.


Sycosis.

(Synonyms: Sycosis Vulgaris; Sycosis Non-parasitica; Folliculitis Barb       ; Sycosis Coccogenica.)

What do you understand by sycosis?

Sycosis is a chronic, inflammatory affection involving the
hair-follicles, usually of the moustache and bearded regions only, and
characterized by papules, tubercles, and pustules perforated by hairs.

Describe the symptoms of sycosis.

Sycosis begins by the formation of papules and pustules about
the hair-follicles; the lesions occur in numbers, in close proximity,
[Pg 131]
and together with the accompanying inflammation, make up a small
or large area. The pustules are small, rounded, flat or acuminated,
discrete, and yellowish in color; they are perforated by hairs, show
no tendency to rupture, and are apt to occur in crops, drying to thin
yellowish or brownish crusts. Papules and tubercles are often intermingled.
More or less swelling and infiltration are noticeable.

Fig. 26.






Sycosis       not infrequently begins in, and sometimes limited to, this region.

The disease is seen, as a rule, only on the bearded part of the face,
either about the cheeks, chin or upper lip, involving a small portion
or the whole of these parts. It is also sometimes met with involving
the hair follicles just within the nasal orifice, and may even be
limited to this region.

Occasionally a sycosiform eruption, usually of the side of the
bearded region, leaves behind a smooth or keloidal scar, the disease
gradually extending       ulerythema sycosiforme (lupoid sycosis).

An inflammation of the hair-follicles of the scalp apparently
sycosiform in character, occurring as discrete or aggregated lesions,
is sometimes observed, the follicles being destroyed and atrophy or
slight scarring resulting       folliculitis decalvans.

Does conspicuous hair loss occur in sycosis?

Ordinarily not; the hairs are, especially at first, usually firmly
seated, but in those cases in which suppuration is active, and has
[Pg 132]
involved the follicles, they may, as a rule, be easily extracted. In
some cases destruction of the follicles ensues and slight scarring and
permanent hair loss result.

State the character of the subjective symptoms.

Pain and itching and a sense of burning, variable as to degree,
may be present.

What is the course of the disease?

Essentially chronic, the inflammatory action being of a subacute
or sluggish character, with acute exacerbations.

State the causes of sycosis.

Upon the upper lip it may have its origin in a nasal catarrh.
Entrance into the follicles of pyogenic micrococci is now regarded as
the essential factor. This view being accepted, carries with it the
possibility of contagiousness.

It is seen in the male sex only, usually in those between the ages
of twenty-five and fifty; and is met with in those in good and bad
health, and among rich and poor. It is comparatively infrequent.

What is the pathology of sycosis?

The disease is primarily a perifolliculitis, the follicle and its sheath
subsequently becoming involved in the inflammatory process.

How would you distinguish sycosis from eczema?

Eczema is rarely sharply limited to the bearded region, but is apt
to involve other parts of the face; moreover, the lesions are usually
confluent, and there is either an oozing, red crusted surface, or it is
dry and scaly.

How would you exclude tinea sycosis in the diagnosis?

In tinea sycosis, or ringworm sycosis, the history of the case is
different. The parts are distinctly lumpy and nodular; the hairs
are soon involved and become dry, brittle, loose, and fall out, or
they may be readily extracted. The superficial type of ringworm
sycosis is readily distinguished by the ring-like character of the
patches. In doubtful cases, microscopic examination of the hairs
may be resorted to.

Give the prognosis of sycosis.

The disease is curable, but almost invariably obstinate and rebellious
to treatment. The duration, extent, and character of the
[Pg 133]
inflammatory process must all be considered. An expression of an
opinion as to the length of time required for a cure should always
be guarded.

Ulerythema sycosiforme is extremely obstinate. Folliculitis decalvans
is also rebellious.

How is sycosis to be treated?

Mainly, and often exclusively, by external applications.

Fig. 27.





Sycosis.

Is constitutional treatment of no avail in sycosis?

In some instances; but, as a rule, it is negative. If indicated,
such remedies as tonics, alteratives, cod-liver oil and the like are to
be prescribed.

Describe the external treatment.

Crusting, if present, is to be removed by warm embrocations. If
the inflammation is of a high grade, and the parts tender and painful,
soothing applications, such as bland oils, black wash and oxide-of-zinc
ointment, cold cream and petrolatum, are to be used;
[Pg 134]
boric-acid solution, fifteen grains to the ounce, may be advised in place of
black wash.

In most cases, however, astringent and stimulating remedies are
demanded from the start, such as: diachylon ointment, alone or
with ten to thirty grains of calomel to the ounce; oleate of mercury,
as a five- to twenty-per-cent. ointment; precipitated sulphur, one
to three drachms to the ounce of benzoated lard, or lard and lanolin;
a ten- to twenty-five-per-cent. ichthyol ointment; and resorcin lotion
or ointment, ten to twenty per cent. strength.

Fig. 28.





Sycosis.


A change from one application to another will be found necessary
in almost all cases.

In obstinate cases the x-ray treatment can be used, as it has
proved itself valuable in some instances; as in other diseases, it
should be employed cautiously.

What would you advise in regard to shaving?

When bearable (and after a few days' application of soothing
remedies it almost always is), it is to be advised in all cases, as it
[Pg 135]
materially aids in the treatment. After a cure is effected it should
be continued for some months, until the healthy condition of the
parts is thoroughly established.

When is depilation advisable as a therapeutic measure?

When the suppurative process is active, in order to save the follicles
from destruction; incising or puncturing the pustules will often
accomplish the same end.

Depilation is in all cases a valuable therapeutic measure, but it is
painful; as a routine practice, shaving is less objectionable and, upon
the whole, is probably as satisfactory. Those who make free use
of the x-ray commonly push it to the point of producing depilation.


Dermatitis Papillaris Capillitii.

(Synonym: Acne Keloid.)

Fig. 29.





Dermatitis Papillaris Capillitii

Describe dermatitis papillaris capillitii.

This is a peculiar, mildly inflammatory, sycosiform, keloidal,
acne-like disease of the hairy border of the back of the neck,
often extending upward to the occipital region; partaking,
[Pg 136]
especially later in its course, somewhat of the nature of keloid. Several
or more acne-like lesions, papular and pustular, closely grouped or
bunched, appear, developing slowly, usually to the size of peas; are
red, pale red, or whitish, often enveloping small tufts of hair, and
attended with more or less hair loss. Its course is gradual and
persistent. It is an exceedingly rare condition, the exact nature
of which is still obscure.

Give the treatment.

Treatment, which is usually unsatisfactory, consists of stimulating
applications       the same, in fact, as employed in sycosis, sulphur and
ichthyol deserving special mention. Depilation is essential.


Impetigo Contagiosa.

Give a descriptive definition of impetigo contagiosa.

Impetigo contagiosa is an acute, contagious, inflammatory disease,
characterized by the formation of discrete, superficial, flat,
rounded, or ovalish vesicles or blebs, soon becoming vesico-pustular,
and drying to thin yellowish crusts.

Upon what parts does the eruption commonly appear?

Upon the face, scalp, and hands, and exceptionally upon other regions.

Describe the symptoms of impetigo contagiosa.

One, several or more small pin-head-sized papulo-vesicles or vesicles
make their appearance, usually upon the face and fingers. In the
male adult the region of the neck and beard is a favorite situation.
They increase in size by extending peripherally, but are more or less
flattened and umbilicated, and are without conspicuous areola. The
lesions may attain the size of a dime or larger, and when close
together may coalesce and form a large patch. In some cases distinct
blebs result, and a picture of pemphigus eruption presented;
it is probable that many of the cases of        contagious pemphigus       
belong to this class. New lesions may appear for several days,
but finally, in the course of a week or ten days, they have all dried
to thin, wafer-like crusts, of a straw or light-yellow color, but slightly
adherent, and appearing as if stuck on; these soon drop off, leaving
faint reddish spots, which gradually fade. In some cases there is
[Pg 137]
so decided a tendency to clear and dry up centrally while spreading
peripherally that the eruption has a ring-like aspect; this seems
especially so in the bearded region of the male adult.

Instead of presenting as described, it may occur as one or more
pea- or finger-nail-sized, rounded and elevated, usually firm, discrete
pustules, scattered over one part, or more commonly over various
regions, such as the face, hands, feet and lower extremities. The
pustules are such from the beginning, and when developed are
usually of the size of a pea or finger-nail, elevated, semi-globular or
rounded, with somewhat thick and tough walls, and of a whitish or
yellowish color; at first there may be a slight inflammatory areola,
but as the lesion matures this almost, if not entirely, disappears.
The pustules show no disposition to umbilication, rupture or coalescence;
drying in the course of several days or a week to yellowish
or brownish crusts, which soon drop off, leaving no permanent trace.
This variety was formerly thought to be a distinct disease, and
was described under the name of impetigo simplex.

As a rule there are no constitutional symptoms, but in the more
severe cases the eruption may be preceded by febrile disturbance
and malaise. Itching may or may not be present.


State the cause of the disease.

It is contagious, the contents of the lesions being inoculable and
auto-inoculable. At times it seems to prevail in epidemic form.
Pyogenic micro      rganisms are now regarded as causative. A relationship
to vaccination has been alleged by some observers. It is
more commonly observed in infants and young children.


From what diseases is impetigo contagiosa to be differentiated?

From eczema, pemphigus, and ecthyma.


How does impetigo contagiosa differ from these several diseases?

By the character of the lesions, their growth, their superficial
nature, their course, the absence of an inflammatory base and areola,
the thin, yellowish, wafer-like crusts, and usually a history of contagion.
[Pg 138]

State the prognosis.

The effect of treatment is usually prompt. The disease, indeed,
tends to spontaneous disappearance in two to four weeks; in exceptional
instances, more especially in those cases in which itching is
present, the excoriations or scratch-marks become inoculated, and
in this way it may persist several weeks.


What is the treatment of impetigo contagiosa?

Treatment consists in the destruction of the auto-inoculable properties
of the contents of the lesions; this is effected by removing
the crusts by means of warm water-and-soap washings, and subsequently
rubbing in an ointment of ammoniated mercury, ten to
twenty grains to the ounce. Some cases respond more rapidly to
the use of a drying ointment, such as Lassar's paste, with ten to
twenty grains of white precipitate or sulphur to the ounce. In
itching cases, a saturated solution of boric acid, or a carbolic-acid
lotion, one to two drachms to the pint, is to be employed for general
application.


Impetigo Herpetiformis.


Describe impetigo herpetiformis.

Impetigo herpetiformis is an extremely rare disease, observed
usually in pregnant women, and is characterized by the appearance
of numerous isolated and closely-crowded pin-head-sized superficial
pustules, which show a decided disposition to the formation of circular
groups or patches. The central portion of these groups dries to
crusts, while new pustules appear at the peripheral portion. They
tend to coalesce, and in this manner a greater part of the whole surface
may, in the course of weeks or months, become involved. Profound
constitutional disturbance, usually of a septic character, precedes
and accompanies the disease; in almost every instance a fatal
termination sooner or later results.

It is possibly a grave type of dermatitis herpetiformis.


Ecthyma.


Give a descriptive definition of ecthyma.

Ecthyma is a disease characterized by the appearance of one, several
or more discrete, finger-nail-sized, flat, usually markedly inflammatory
pustules.
[Pg 139]


Describe the symptoms and course of ecthyma.

The lesions begin as small, usually pea-sized, pustules; increase
somewhat in area, and when fully developed are dime-sized, or larger,
somewhat flat, with a markedly inflammatory base and areola. At
first yellowish they soon become, from the admixture of blood, reddish,
and dry to brownish crusts, beneath which will be found superficial
excoriations. The individual pustules are usually somewhat
acute in their course, but new lesions may continue to appear from
day to day or week to week. As a rule, not more than five to twenty
are present at one time, and in most cases they are seated on the
legs. More or less pigmentation, and sometimes superficial scarring,
may remain to mark the site of the lesions.

Itching is rarely present, but there may be more or less pain and
tenderness.


What is the cause of ecthyma?

It is essentially a disease of the poorly cared-for and ill-fed; the
direct exciting cause is the introduction of pyogenic micro      rganisms
into the follicular openings. It is closely allied to impetigo contagiosa,
and may in fact be regarded as a markedly inflammatory
form of the latter affection. It seems much less contagious, however.
It is commonly observed in male adults.


From what diseases is ecthyma to be differentiated?

From impetigo contagiosa, and the flat pustular syphiloderm.


How is it distinguished from these several diseases?

The size, shape, inflammatory action, and the depraved general
condition, the distribution and lesser-contagiousness will distinguish
it from impetigo contagiosa; and the absence of concomitant symptoms
of syphilis, and of positive ulceration, as well as its distribution
and more rapid and inflammatory course, will exclude the pustular
syphiloderm.


State the prognosis.

The disease is readily curable, disappearing upon the removal of
the predisposing cause and the employment of local antiseptic applications.
[Pg 140]


What treatment is to be advised?

Good food, proper hygiene and tonic remedies; and, locally, removal
of the crusts and stimulation of the underlying surface with an
ointment of ammoniated mercury, ten to thirty grains to the ounce.

The following mild antiseptic lotion, which materially lessens the
tendency to the formation of new lesions, may be applied to the
affected region two or three times daily:       


          Acidi borici, ....................................       iv
    Resorcini, .......................................       ij
    Glycerin       , ...................................... f      ij
    Alcoholis, ...................................... f       j
    Aqu       , ....................q.s. ad. ............... Oj.   M.


A weak lotion of thymol, corrosive sublimate or ichthyol would
doubtless be equally effectual.


Pemphigus.


What do you understand by pemphigus?

Pemphigus is an acute or chronic disease characterized by the successive
formation of irregularly-scattered, variously-sized blebs.


Name the varieties met with.

Two varieties are usually described       pemphigus vulgaris and
pemphigus foliaceus.


Describe the symptoms and course of pemphigus vulgaris.

With or without precursory symptoms of systemic disturbance,
irregularly scattered blebs, few or in numbers, make their appearance,
arising from erythematous spots or from apparently normal
skin. They vary in size from a pea to a large egg, are rounded or
ovalish, usually distended, and contain a yellowish fluid which, later,
becomes cloudy or puriform. If ruptured, the rete is exposed, but
the skin soon regains its normal condition; if undisturbed, the fluid
usually disappears by absorption. Each lesion runs its course in
several days or a week.

A grave type of pemphigus is exceptionally observed in the newborn       pemphigus
neonatorum.
[Pg 141]


What course does pemphigus vulgaris pursue?

Usually chronic. The disease may subside in several months and
the process come to an end, constituting the acute type. As a rule,
however, the disease is chronic, new blebs continuing to appear
from time to time for an indefinite period.


Fig. 30.






Pemphigus (mulatto).


In what respects does the severe form of pemphigus vulgaris
differ from the ordinary type?

In the severe or malignant type the eruption is more profuse;
there is marked, and often grave, systemic depression, and the
lesions are attended with ulcerative action.


Describe the symptoms and course of pemphigus foliaceus.

In this, the grave type of the disease, the blebs are loose and
flaccid, with milky or puriform contents, rupturing and drying to
[Pg 142]
crusts, which are cast off, disclosing the reddened corium. New
blebs appear on the sites of disappearing or half-ruptured lesions,
and the whole surface may be thus involved and the disease continue
for years, compromising the general health and eventually
ending fatally.

In some cases of pemphigus (pemphigus vegetans) a vegetating
or papillomatous condition develops from the base of the lesion,
with an offensive discharge; it is usually a grave type of the
malady.

Exceptionally cases (dermatitis vegetans) are met with which
have a close similarity in their symptoms to pemphigus vegetans,
but in which the eruption is more or less limited to the genitocrural
region. The disorder is not malignant and usually yields to cleanliness
and antiseptics.


What is the character of the subjective symptoms in pemphigus?

The subjective symptoms consist variously of heat, tenderness,
pain, burning and itching, and may be slight or troublesome.


What is known in regard to the etiology of pemphigus?

The causes are obscure; general debility, overwork, shock, nervous
exhaustion, and septic conditions (micro      rganisms) are thought
to be of influence. There seems no doubt that those who have to
do with cattle products, especially butchers, are subjects of acute
and usually grave pemphigus. Vaccination has exceptionally been
responsible for the disease, probably through some coincidental infection.
The disease is not contagious, nor is it due to syphilis. It
may occur at any age.

It is a rare disease, especially in this country. Most of the cases
diagnosed as pemphigus by the inexperienced are examples of bullous
urticaria, bullous erythema multiforme, and impetigo contagiosa.


What is the pathology?

The lesions are superficially seated, usually between the horny
layer and upper part of the rete. Round-cell infiltration and dilated
blood vessels are found about the papill        and in the subcutaneous
tissue. The contents of the blebs, always of alkaline reaction, are
[Pg 143]
at first serous, later containing blood corpuscles, pus, fatty-acid
crystals, epithelial cells, and occasionally uric acid crystals and free
ammonia.


From what diseases is pemphigus to be differentiated?

From herpes iris, the bullous syphiloderm, impetigo contagiosa
and dermatitis herpetiformis.


How do these several diseases differ from pemphigus?

The acute course, small lesions, concentric arrangement, variegated
colors, and distribution, in herpes iris; the thick, bulky, greenish
crusts, the underlying ulceration, the course, history, and the presence
of concomitant symptoms of syphilis, in the bullous syphiloderm;
the history, course, distribution, the character of the crusting,
and the contagious and auto-inoculable properties of the contents
of the lesions, in impetigo contagiosa; the tendency to appear in
groups, the smaller lesions, the intense itchiness, course, multiform
characters of the eruption and the disposition to change of type in
dermatitis herpetiformis,       will serve as differential points.


State the prognosis of pemphigus.

Its duration is uncertain, and the issue may in severe cases be fatal.
In the milder types, after months or several years, recovery may
take place.

The extent and severity of the disease and the general condition
of the patient are always to be considered before an opinion is
expressed.

Pemphigus neonatorum usually ends fatally.


Give the treatment of pemphigus.

Both constitutional and local measures are demanded. Good
nutritious food and hygienic regulations are essential. Arsenic and
quinia are the most valuable remedies. The former, in occasional
instances, seems to have a specific influence, and should always be
tried, beginning with small doses and increasing gradually to the
point of tolerance and continued for several weeks or longer. The
remedy should not be set aside as long as there are signs of improvement,
unless the supervention of stomachic, intestinal or other disturbance
demand its discontinuance. Other tonics, such as iron,
strychnia and cod-liver oil, are also at times of service.
[Pg 144]
The blebs should be opened and the parts anointed or covered
with a mild ointment. In more general cases bran, starch and
gelatin baths, and in severe cases the continuous bath, if practicable,
are to be used.


CLASS III.       HEMORRHAGES.


Purpura.


Define purpura.

Purpura is a hemorrhagic affection characterized by the appearance
of variously-sized, usually non-elevated, smooth, reddish or
purplish spots or patches, not disappearing under pressure.


Name the several varieties met with.

Three       purpura simplex, purpura rheumatica and purpura h       morrhagica;
denoting, respectively, the mild, moderate and severe
grade of the disease. The division is, to a great extent, an arbitrary
one.


Describe the clinical appearance and course of an individual
lesion of purpura.

The spot, which may be pin-head, pea-, bean-sized or larger,
appears suddenly, and is of a bright red or purplish red color. Its
brightness gradually fades, the color changing to a bluish, bluish-green,
bluish- or greenish-yellow, dirty yellowish, yellowish-white,
and finally disappearing; varying in duration from several days to
several weeks.


Describe the symptoms of purpura simplex.

Purpura simplex, or the mild form, shows itself as pin-point to
pea- or bean-sized, bright or dark-red spots, limited, as a rule, to the
limbs, especially the lower extremities; fading gradually away and
coming to an end in a few weeks, or new crops appearing irregularly
for several months. There is rarely any systemic disturbance, and,
as a rule, no subjective symptoms; in exceptional cases an urticarial
element is added       purpura urticans.


Describe the symptoms of purpura rheumatica.

Purpura rheumatica (also called peliosis rheumatica) is usually
preceded by symptoms of malaise, rheumatic pains and sometimes
[Pg 145]
swelling about the joints; these phenomena abate and frequently
disappear upon the outbreak of the eruption. The lesions are pea-
to dime-sized, smooth, non-elevated, or slightly raised, and of a reddish
or purplish color; the eruption may be more or less generalized,
most abundant upon the limbs, or it may be limited to these parts.
It may end in a few weeks, or may persist for several months, new
spots appearing irregularly or in the form of crops.

As somewhat allied to this is another form (Sch      nlein's disease),
quite alarming in its symptoms. It is rare. It is characterized by
symptoms partaking of the nature of rheumatism, purpuric spots,
blotches and ecchymoses, erythema multiforme, and often associated
with considerable edema. The throat is also usually invaded, and
indeed the first symptom is commonly in this region. Considerable
constitutional disturbance, of a threatening character, is commonly
observed. Recovery usually takes place.

Henoch's purpura, observed chiefly in children, resembles the
above, with the erythema multiforme character and the        dematous
swellings more pronounced, while the actual purpuric symptoms are
less conspicuous. Gastric and intestinal symptoms and hemorrhages
from the mucous membrane are commonly noted. It is fatal in
about 20 per cent. of the cases.


Describe the symptoms of purpura h       morrhagica.

Purpura h       morrhagica (also called land scurvy) is characterized
usually by premonitory, and frequently accompanying, symptoms of
general distress, and by the appearance of coin to palm-sized, red or
purplish hemorrhagic spots or patches, smooth, non-elevated or
raised. Hemorrhage from the mouth, gums and other parts, slight
or serious in character, may occur. New lesions continue to appear
for several days or weeks; and in exceptional instances, repeated
relapses take place, and the disease thus persists for months. It
may end fatally.


State the etiology of purpura.

In most instances no cause can be assigned. The disease occurs
at all ages from childhood to advanced life, and in individuals, apparently,
in good and bad health alike. The hemorrhagic type is oftener
seen in subjects debilitated or in a depraved state of health. A
micro      rganism is also looked upon as a factor by some observers,
especially in the grave type of disease.
[Pg 146]


State the diagnostic characters of purpura.

The appearance, irregularly or in crops, of bright-red or purplish
spots, evidently of hemorrhagic nature, and not disappearing upon
pressure, and as they are fading, going through the several changes
of color usually observed in any ecchymosis.


How does scurvy (scorbutus) differ from purpura?

Scurvy, which may resemble the severe grade of purpura, has a
different history, a recognizable cause, usually a peculiar distribution,
and is accompanied with general weakness and a spongy, soft and
bleeding condition of the gums.


What is the pathology of purpura?

The lesion of purpura consists essentially of a hemorrhage into
the cutaneous tissues. The blood is subsequently absorbed, the
h       matin undergoing changes of color from a red to greenish and
pale yellow, and finally fading away.

State the prognosis

The milder varieties disappear in the course of several weeks or
months, and are rarely of serious import; the outcome of purpura
h       morrhagica is somewhat uncertain; although usually favorable, a
fatal result from internal hemorrhage is possible. The variety
known as Sch      nlein's disease is alarming, but seldom fatal. Henoch's
disease is, however, always of grave import.


What is the treatment of purpura?

Hygienic and dietary measures, the administration of tonics and
astringents, and, in severe cases, by relative or absolute rest.

The drugs commonly prescribed are: ergot, oil of erigeron, oil of
turpentine, quinia, strychnia, iron, mineral acids, and gallic acid.
External treatment is rarely called for, but if deemed advisable, astringent
lotions may be employed.


Scorbutus.

(Synonyms: Scurvy; Sea Scurvy; Purpura Scorbutica.)


Describe scorbutus.

Scurvy is a peculiar constitutional state, developed in those living
under bad hygienic conditions, and is characterized by emaciation,
[Pg 147]
general febrile and asthenic symptoms, a more or less swollen, turgid
and spongy and even gangrenous condition of the gums; and concomitantly,
or sooner or later, by the appearance, usually upon the
lower portion of the legs only, of dark-colored hemorrhagic patches
or blotches. The skin of the affected part may become brawny and
slightly scaly, and not infrequently may break down and ulcerate.
Hemorrhages from the various mucous surfaces, slight or grave,
may also take place.


State the etiology of scurvy.

It is due to long-continued deprivation of proper food, especially
of fruits and vegetables. Other bad hygienic conditions favor its
development. It is seen most commonly in sailors and others taking
long voyages.


How is scurvy to be distinguished from purpura?

By the asthenic and emaciated general condition and the peculiar
puffy, spongy state of the gums. The cutaneous manifestation is
more diffused, forming usually large palm-sized patches, and, as a
rule, limited to the region of the ankles or lower part of the legs.


Give the prognosis of scurvy.

The disease is remediable, and usually rapidly so. In those instances
in which the same bad hygienic conditions and the ingestion
of improper food are continued, death finally results.


What treatment would you advise in scurvy?

Proper food, with an abundance of fruit and vegetables. Lemon or
lime juice is especially valuable, and is to be taken freely. If indicated,
tonics and stimulants are also to be prescribed. For the relief
of the tumid, spongy condition of the gums, astringent and antiseptic
mouth washes are to be employed.

The cutaneous manifestations, when tending to ulceration, are to
be treated upon general principles.
[Pg 148]



CLASS IV.       HYPERTROPHIES.


Lentigo.

(Synonym: Freckle.)


Describe lentigo.

Lentigo, or freckle, is characterized by round or irregular, pin-head
to pea-sized, yellowish, brownish or blackish spots, occurring
usually about the face and the backs of the hands. It is a common
affection, varying somewhat in the degree of development;
the freckles present may be few and insignificant, or they may exist
in profusion and be quite disfiguring. Heat and exposure favor their
development. Those of light complexion, especially those with red
hair, are its most common subjects. The color of the lesion is usually
a yellowish-brown.

It is common to all ages, but is generally seen in its greatest
development during adolescence, the disposition to its appearance
becoming less marked as age advances.


What is the pathology of lentigo?

Lentigo consists simply of a circumscribed deposit of pigment
granules       merely a localized increase of the normal pigment, differing
from chloasma (q. v.) only in the size and shape of the pigmentation.


State the prognosis.

The blemishes can be removed by treatment, but their return is
almost certain.


Name the several applications commonly employed for their
removal.

An aqueous or alcoholic solution of corrosive sublimate, one-half
to three grains to the ounce; lactic acid, one part to from six to
twenty parts of water; and an ointment containing a drachm each
of bismuth subnitrate and ammoniated mercury to the ounce.

The applications, which act by removing the epidermal and rete
cells and with them the pigment, are made two or three times daily,
and their use intermitted for a few days as soon as the skin becomes
irritated or scaly.

Touching each freckle for a few seconds with the electric needle,
just pricking the epidermis, will occasionally remove the blemish.
[Pg 149]


Chloasma.


What do you understand by chloasma?

Chloasma consists of an abnormal deposit of pigment, occurring as
variously-sized and shaped, yellowish, brownish or blackish patches.


Describe the clinical appearances of chloasma.

Chloasma appears either in ill-defined patches, as is commonly the
case, or as a diffuse discoloration. Its appearance is rapid or gradual,
generally the latter. The patches are rounded or irregular, and
usually shade off into the sound skin. One, several or more may be
present, and coalescence may take place, resulting in a large irregular
pigmented area. The color is yellowish, or brownish, and may
even be blackish (melasma, melanoderma). The skin is otherwise
normal. The face is the most common site.


Into what two general classes may the various examples of
chloasma be grouped?

Idiopathic and symptomatic.


What cases of chloasma are included in the idiopathic group?

All those cases of pigmentation caused by external agents, such
as the sun's rays, sinapisms, blisters, continued cutaneous hyper       mia
from scratching or any other cause, etc.


What cases of chloasma are included in the symptomatic
group?

All forms of pigment deposit which occur as a consequence of
various organic and systemic diseases, as the pigmentation, for instance,
seen in association with tuberculosis, cancer, malaria, Addison's
disease, uterine affections, and the like. In such cases, with
few exceptions, the pigmentation is usually more or less diffuse.


What is chloasma uterinum?

Chloasma uterinum is a term applied to the ill-defined patches of
yellowish-brown pigmentation appearing upon the faces of women,
usually between the ages of twenty-five and fifty. It is most commonly
seen during pregnancy, but may occur in connection with any
functional or organic disease of the utero-ovarian apparatus.
[Pg 150]


What is argyria?

Argyria is the term applied to the slate-like discoloration which
follows the prolonged administration of silver nitrate.


State the pathology of chloasma.

The sole change consists in an increased deposit of pigment.


Give the prognosis of chloasma.

Unless a removal of the exciting or predisposing cause is possible,
the prognosis is, as a rule, unfavorable, and the relief furnished by
local applications usually but temporary.


If constitutional treatment is advisable, upon what is it to be
based?

Upon general principles; there are no special remedies.


How do external remedies act?

Mainly by removing the rete cells and with them the pigmentation;
and partly, also, by stimulating the absorbents.


Are all external remedies which tend to remove the upper
layers of the skin equally useful for this purpose?

No; on the contrary some such applications are followed by an increase
in the pigment deposit.


Name the several applications commonly employed.

Corrosive sublimate in solution, in the strength of one to four
grains to the ounce of alcohol and water; a lotion made up as follows:       


          Hydrargyri chlorid. corros., ..................... gr. iij-viij
    Ac. acet. dilut., ............................... f      ij
    Sodii borat., ....................................        ij
    Aqu        ros       , ...................................... f       iv.   M.


And also the following:       


          Hydrargyri chlorid. corros., ..................... gr. iij-viij
    Zinci sulphat.,
    Plumbi acetat., ..................            ..............       ss
    Aqu       , ........................................... f       iv.   M.


And lactic acid, with from five to twenty parts of water; and an
[Pg 151]
ointment containing a drachm each of bismuth subnitrate and white
precipitate to the ounce. Hydrogen peroxide occasionally acts well.
Trichloracetic acid, usually weakened with one or two parts water,
may be cautiously tried. The application of a strong alcoholic solution
of resorcin, twenty to fifty per cent. strength, is also valuable, as
is also a two to ten per cent. alcoholic solution of salicylic acid.

(Applications are made two or three times daily, and as soon as
slight scaliness or irritation is produced are to be discontinued for
one or two days.)

Tattoo-marks are difficult to remove. Excision is the surest
method. Electrolysis, applying the needle at various points, somewhat
close together, and using a fairly strong current       three to
eight milliamp        res       will exceptionally, especially when repeated
several times, produce a reactive inflammation and casting-off of the
tissue containing the pigment; a scar is left.

Several writers claim good results with glycerole of papain, pricking
it in in the same manner as in tattooing.

Gun-powder marks. If recent, but a day or so after their occurrence,
the larger specks may be picked or scraped out. Later,
electrolysis, using a fairly strong current, may result in their removal.
Their removal may also be satisfactorily effected with a
minute cutaneous trephine.


Keratosis Pilaris.

(Synonyms: Pityriasis Pilaris; Lichen Pilaris.)


What is meant by keratosis pilaris?

Keratosis pilaris may be defined as a hypertrophic affection
characterized by the formation of pin-head-sized, conical, epidermic
elevations seated about the apertures of the hair follicles.


Describe the clinical appearances of keratosis pilaris.

The lesions are usually limited to the extensor surfaces of the
thighs and arms, especially the former. They appear as pin-head-sized,
whitish or grayish elevations, consisting of accumulations of
epithelial matter about the apertures of the hair follicles. Each elevation
is pierced by a hair, or the hair may be twisted and imprisoned
within the epithelial mass; or it may be broken off just at the
[Pg 152]
point of emergence at the apex of the papule, in which event it may
be seen as a dark, central speck. The skin is usually dry, rough and
harsh, and in marked cases, to the hand passing over it, feels not
unlike a nutmeg-grater. The disease varies in its development, in
most cases being so slight as to escape attention. As a rule, it is
free from itching.


What course does keratosis pilaris pursue?

It is sluggish and chronic.


Mention some of the etiological factors.

It is not an uncommon disease, and is seen usually in those who are
unaccustomed to frequent bathing, being most frequently met with
during the winter months. It is chiefly observed during early adult
life.


Is there any difficulty in the diagnosis?

No. It is thought at times to bear some resemblance to goose-flesh
(cutis anserina), the miliary papular syphiloderm in its desquamating
stage, and lichen scrofulosus. In goose-flesh the elevations
are evanescent and of an entirely different character; the papules
of the syphiloderm are usually generalized, of a reddish color, tend
to group, are more solid and deeply-seated, less scaly and are accompanied
with other symptoms of syphilis; in lichen scrofulosus the
papules are larger, incline to occur in groups, and appear usually
upon the abdomen.


State the prognosis.

The disease yields readily to treatment.


Give the treatment of keratosis pilaris.

Frequent warm baths, with the use of a toilet soap or sapo viridis,
will usually be found curative. Alkaline baths are also useful. In
obstinate cases the ordinary mild ointments, glycerine, etc., are to be
advised in conjunction with the baths.
[Pg 153]


Keratosis Follicularis.


Describe keratosis follicularis.

Keratosis follicularis (Darier's disease, ichthyosis follicularis, ichthyosis
sebacea cornea, psorospermosis) is a rare disease characterized
by pin-head to pea-sized pointed, rounded, or irregularly-shaped
grayish, brownish, red or even black, horny papules or elevations,
arising from the sebaceous or hair-follicles. They are, for the most
part, discrete, with a tendency here and there to form solid aggregations
or areas. Many of them contain projecting cornified plugs
which may be squeezed out, leaving pit-like depressions. The face,
scalp, lower trunk, groins and flanks are the parts chiefly affected.
The view advanced by Darier, that the malady was due to psorosperms,
is now denied, the bodies thought to be such having been
demonstrated to be due to cell transformation.

As to treatment, in one instance the induction of a substitutive
dermatic inflammation had a favorable influence.


Molluscum Epitheliale.

(Synonyms: Molluscum Contagiosum; Molluscum Sebaceum; Epithelioma
Molluscum.)


Give a definition of molluscum epitheliale.

Molluscum epitheliale is characterized by pin-head to pea-sized,
rounded, semi-globular, or flattened, pearl-like elevations, of a whitish
or pinkish color.


Describe the symptoms and course of molluscum epitheliale.

The usual seat is the face; not infrequently, however, the growths
occur on other parts. The lesions begin as pin-head, waxy-looking,
rounded or acuminated elevations, gradually attaining the size of
small peas. They have a broad base or occasionally may tend to become
pedunculated. They rarely exist in profusion, in most cases
three to ten or twelve lesions being present. When fully developed
they are somewhat flattened and umbilicated, with a central, darkish
point representing the mouth of the follicle. They are whitish or
pinkish, and look not unlike drops of wax or pearl buttons. At first
they are firm, but eventually, in most cases, tend to become soft and
break down. Not infrequently, however, the lesions disappear slowly
by absorption, without apparent previous softening. Their course
[Pg 154]
is usually chronic. The contents, a cheesy-looking mass, may commonly
be pressed out without difficulty.


What is the cause of molluscum epitheliale?

It is now generally accepted that the disease is mildly contagious.
It occurs chiefly in children, and especially among the poorer classes.
The belief in the parasitic nature of the disease is gaining ground;
recently the opinion has been advanced that it is due to psorosperms
(psorospermosis); but further investigations have indicated that
these bodies were degenerated epithelia.


State the pathology.

Fig. 31.





Molluscum Epitheliale.

According to recent investigations, molluscum epitheliale is to be
regarded as a hyperplasia of the rete, the growth probably beginning
in the hair-follicles; the so-called molluscum bodies       peculiar,
[Pg 155]
rounded or ovoidal, sharply-defined, fatty-looking bodies found in
microscopical examination of the growth       are to be viewed as a
form of epithelial degeneration.


What are the diagnostic points in molluscum epitheliale?

The size of the lesions, their waxy or glistening appearance, and
the presence of the central orifice.

It is to be differentiated from molluscum fibrosum, warts and acne.


State the prognosis.

The growths are amenable to treatment. In some instances the
disease, after existing some weeks, tends to disappear spontaneously.


What is the treatment of molluscum epitheliale?

Incision and expression of the contents, and touching the base of
the cavity with silver nitrate. Pedunculated growths may be ligated.
In some cases an ointment of ammoniated mercury, twenty to forty
grains to the ounce, applied, by gently rubbing, once or twice daily,
will bring about a cure.


Callositas.

(Synonyms: Tylosis; Tyloma; Callus; Callous; Callosity; Keratoma.)


What do you understand by callositas?

A hard, thickened, horny patch made up of the corneous layers
of the epidermis.


Describe the clinical appearances.

Callosities are most common about the hands and feet, and consist
of small or large patches of dry, grayish-yellow looking, hard,
slight or excessive epidermic accumulations. They are somewhat
elevated, especially at the central portion, and gradually merge into
the healthy skin. The natural surface lines are in a great measure
obliterated, the patches usually being smooth and horn-like.

Keratosis palmaris et plantaris (symmetric keratodermia), as regards
the local condition, is a somewhat similar affection. It consists
of hypertrophy of the corneous layer of the palm and soles,
usually of a more or less horny and plate-like character, but is congenital
or hereditary, and not necessarily dependent upon local friction
or pressure.
[Pg 156]


Are there any inflammatory symptoms in callositas?

No; but exceptionally, from accidental injury, the subjacent corium
becomes inflamed, suppurates, and the thickened mass is cast off.


State the causes of callositas.

Pressure and friction; for example, on the hands, from the use of
various tools and implements, and on the feet from ill-fitting shoes.
It is, indeed, often to be looked upon as an effort of nature to
protect the more delicate corium.

In exceptional instances it arises without apparent cause.


What is the pathology?

The epidermis alone is involved; it consists, in fact, of a hyperplasia
of the horny layer.


State the prognosis of callositas.

If the causes are removed, the accumulation, as a rule, gradually
disappears. The effect of treatment is always rapid and positive,
but unless the etiological factors have ceased to act, the result is
usually but temporary.


How is callositas treated?

When treatment is deemed advisable, it consists in softening the
parts with hot-water soakings or poultices, and subsequently shaving
or scraping off the callous mass. The same result may also be often
effected by the continuous application, for several days or a week, of
a 10 to 15 per cent. salicylated plaster, or the application of a salicylated
collodion, same strength; it is followed up by hot-water
soaking, the accumulation, as a rule, coming readily away.


Clavus.

(Synonym: Corn.)


What is clavus?

Clavus, or corn, is a small, circumscribed, flattened, deep-seated,
horny formation usually seated about the toes.


Describe the clinical appearances.

Ordinarily a corn has the appearance of a small callosity; the skin
is thickened, polished and horny. Exceptionally, however,
[Pg 157]
occurring on parts that are naturally more or less moist, as between the
toes, maceration takes place, and the result is the so-called soft corn.
The dorsal aspect of the toes is the common site for the ordinary
variety. The usual size is that of a small pea. They are painful
on pressure, and, at times, spontaneously so.


State the causes.

Corns are caused by pressure and friction, and may usually be referred
to improperly fitting shoes.


What is the pathology of clavus?

It is a hypertrophy of the epiderm. Its shape is conical, with
the base external and the apex pressing upon the papill       . It is, in
fact, a peculiarly-shaped callosity, the central portion and apex
being dense and horny, forming the so-called core.


Give the treatment of clavus.

A simple method of treatment consists in shaving off, after a preliminary
hot-water soaking, the outer portion, and then applying a
ring of felt or like material, with the hollow part immediately over
the site of the core; this should be worn for several weeks. It is
also possible in some cases to extract the whole corn by gently dissecting
it out; the after-treatment being the same as the above.

Another method is by means of a ten- to fifteen-per-cent. solution
of salicylic acid, in alcohol or collodion, or the following:       


          Ac. salicylici, .................................. gr. xxx
    Ext. cannabis Ind., .............................. gr. x
    Collodii, ....................................... f      iv.   M.


This is painted on the corn night and morning for several days, at
the end of which time the parts are soaked in hot water, and the
mass or a greater part of it, will be found, as a rule, to come readily
away; one or two repetitions may be necessary. Lactic acid, with
one to several parts of water, applied once or twice daily, acts in a
similar manner.

Soft corns, after the removal of pressure, may be treated with the
solid stick of nitrate of silver, or by any of the methods already
mentioned.

In order that treatment be permanently successful, the feet are to
be properly fitted. If pressure is removed, corns will commonly
disappear spontaneously.
[Pg 158]


Cornu Cutaneum.

(Synonyms: Cornu Humanum; Cutaneous Horn.)


What is cornu cutaneum?

A cutaneous horn is a circumscribed hypertrophy of the epidermis,
forming an outgrowth of horny consistence and of variable size and
shape.


At what age and upon what parts are cutaneous horns observed?

They are usually met with late in life, and are mostly seated upon
the face and scalp.

Fig. 32.





Cutaneous Horns. Showing beginning epitheliomatous degeneration of the base.
(After Pancoast.)


Describe the clinical appearances.

In appearance cutaneous horns resemble those seen in the lower
animals, differing, if at all, but slightly. They are hard, solid, dry
and somewhat brittle; usually tapering, and may be either straight,
curved or crooked. Their surface is rough, irregular, laminated or
[Pg 159]
fissured, the ends pointed, blunt or clubbed. The color varies; it is
usually grayish-yellow, but may be even blackish. As commonly
seen they are small in size, a fraction of an inch or an inch or thereabouts
in length, but exceptionally attain considerable proportions.
The base, which rests directly upon the skin, may be broad, flattened,
or concave, with the underlying and adjacent tissues normal
or the papill        hypertrophied; and in some cases there is more or
less inflammation, which may be followed by suppuration. They
are usually solitary formations. They are not, as a rule, painful,
unless knocked or irritated.


What course do cutaneous horns pursue?

Their growth is usually slow, and, after having attained a certain
size, they not infrequently become loose and fall off; they are almost
always reproduced.


What is the cause of these horny growths?

The cause is not known; appearing about the genitalia, they
usually develop from acuminated warts. They are rare formations.


State the pathology of cornu cutaneum.

Horns consist of closely agglutinated epidermic cells, forming
small columns or rods; in the columns themselves the cells are
arranged concentrically. In the base are found hypertrophic papill       
and some bloodvessels. They have their starting-point in the
rete mucosum, either from that lying above the papill        or that
lining the follicles and glands.


Does epitheliomatous degeneration of the base ever occur?

Yes.


State the prognosis.

Cutaneous horns may be readily and permanently removed.


What is the treatment?

Treatment consists in detachment, and subsequent destruction
of the base; the former is accomplished by dissecting the horn away
from the base or forcibly breaking it off, the latter by means of any
of the well-known caustics, such as caustic potash, chloride of zinc
and the galvano-cautery.

Another method is to excise the base, the horn coming away with
it; this necessitates, however, considerable loss of tissue.
[Pg 160]


Verruca.

(Synonym: Wart.)


What is verruca?

Verruca, or wart, is a hard or soft, rounded, flat, acuminated or
filiform, circumscribed epidermal and papillary growth.


Name the several varieties of warts met with.

Verruca vulgaris, verruca plana, verruca plana juvenilis, verruca
digitata, verruca filifortnis and verruca acuminata.


Describe verruca vulgaris.

This is the common wart, occurring mostly upon the hands. It is
rounded, elevated, circumscribed, hard and horny, with a broad base,
and usually the size of a pea. At first it is smooth and covered with
slightly thickened epidermis, but later this disappears to some extent,
the hypertrophied papill       , appearing as minute elevations,
making up the growth. One, several or more may be present.


Describe verruca plana.

This is the so-called flat wart, and occurs commonly upon the
back, especially in elderly people (verruca senilis, keratosis pigmentosa).
It is, as a rule, but slightly elevated, is usually dark in color,
and of the size of a pea or finger-nail.


Describe verruca plana juvenilis.

The warts are mostly pin-head in size, flat, but slightly elevated,
rounded, irregular or square-shaped, and of a light yellowish-brown
color. They bear resemblance to lichen planus papules. They are
apt to be numerous, often becoming aggregated or fused, and occur
usually in young children, and, as a rule, on the face and hands.


Describe verruca filiformis.

This is a thread-like growth about an eighth or fourth of an inch
long, and occurring commonly about the face, eyelids and neck. It
is usually soft to the touch and flexible.


Describe verruca digitata.

This is a variety of wart, which, especially about the edges, is
marked by digitations, extending nearly or quite down to the base.
It is commonly seen upon the scalp.
[Pg 161]


Describe verruca acuminata.

This variety (venereal wart, pointed wart, pointed condyloma),
usually occurs about the genitalia, especially upon the mucous and
muco-cutaneous surfaces. It consists of one or more groups of
acuminated, pinkish or reddish, raspberry-like elevations, and, according
to the region, may be dry or moist; if the latter, the secretion,
which is usually yellowish and puriform, from rapid decomposition,
develops an offensive and penetrating odor. The formation may be
the size of a small pea, or may attain the dimensions of a fist.


What is the cause of warts?

The etiology is not known. They are more common in adolescent
and early adult life. Irritating secretions are thought to be causative
in the acuminated variety. It is highly probable that a parasitic
factor will finally be demonstrated. They are doubtless mildly
contagious.


Fig. 33.





Verruca Acuminata       about the anus. (After Ashton.)


State the pathology of warts.

A wart consists of both epidermic and papillary hypertrophy, the
interior of the growth containing a vascular loop. In the acuminated
variety there are marked papillary enlargement, excessive development
of the mucous layer, and an abundant vascular supply.
[Pg 162]


Give the treatment of warts.

For ordinary warts, excision or destruction by caustics. The repeated
application of a saturated alcoholic solution of salicylic acid is
often curative, the upper portion being pared off from time to time.
The filiform and digitate varieties may be snipped off with the
scissors, and the base touched with nitrate of silver; or a ligature
may be used. Curetting is a valuable operative method. The
growths may also be removed by electrolysis. When warts are
numerous and close together parasiticide applications can be daily
made to the whole affected region. For this purpose a boric acid
solution, containing five to thirty grains of resorcin to the ounce,
and Vleminckx's solution, at first diluted, prove the most valuable.

Verruca acuminata is to be treated by maintaining absolute cleanliness,
and the application of such astringents as liquor plumbi
subacetatis, tincture of iron, powdered alum and boric acid. The
salicylic acid solution may also be used. In obstinate cases, glacial
acetic acid or chromic acid may be cautiously employed.

N       vus Pigmentosus.

(Synonym: Mole.)


Describe n       vus pigmentosus.

N       vus pigmentosus, commonly known as mole, may be defined
as a circumscribed increase in the pigment of the skin, usually associated
with hypertrophy of one or all of the cutaneous structures,
especially of the connective tissue and hair. It occurs singly or in
numbers; is usually pea-, bean-sized or larger, rounded or irregular,
smooth or rough, flat or elevated, and of a color varying from a light
brown to black; the hair found thereon may be either colorless or
deeply pigmented, coarse and of considerable length. It is, as a
rule, a permanent formation.


Name the several varieties of n       vus pigmentosus met with.

N       vus spilus, n       vus pilosus, n       vus verrucosus, and n       vus lipomatodes.
So-called linear n       vus might also be considered as
belonging in this group.
[Pg 163]


What is n       vus spilus?

A smooth and flat n       vus, consisting essentially of augmented
pigmentation alone.

Fig. 34.





Linear N       vus.


What is n       vus pilosus?

A n       vus upon which there is an abnormal growth of hair, slight
or excessive.


What is n       vus verrucosus?

A n       vus to which is added hypertrophy of the papill       , giving
rise to a furrowed and uneven surface.


What is linear n       vus?

Linear n       vus is a formation usually of a verrucous character, more
[Pg 164]
or less pigmented, sometimes slightly scaly, occurring in band-like
or zoster-like areas, and, as a rule, unilaterally.


What is n       vus lipomatodes?

A n       vus with excessive fat and connective-tissue hypertrophy.


State the etiology of n       vus pigmentosus.

The causes are obscure. The growths are usually congenital; but
the smooth, non-hairy moles may be acquired.


Give the pathology of n       vus pigmentosus.

Microscopical examination shows a marked increase in the pigment
in the lowest layers of the rete mucosum, as well as more or
less pigmentation in the corium usually following the course of the
bloodvessels; in the verrucous variety the papill        are greatly hypertrophied,
in addition to the increased pigmentation. There is,
as a rule, more or less connective-tissue hypertrophy.


What is the treatment of n       vus pigmentosus?

In many instances interference is scarcely called for, but when demanded
consists in the removal of the formation either by the knife,
by caustics, or by electrolysis. This last is, in the milder varieties
at least, perhaps the best method, as it is less likely to be followed
by disfiguring cicatrices. In n       vus pilosus the removal of the hairs
alone by electrolysis is not infrequently followed by a decided diminution
of the pigmentation. In recent years both liquid air and carbon
dioxide have also been used successfully in the removal of these
growths. Pigmented n       vi, which show the least tendency to growth
or degenerative change, should be radically removed, as they not infrequently
lead to carcinomatous and sarcomatous growths.
[Pg 165]


Ichthyosis.

(Synonym: Fish-skin Disease.)


Give a descriptive definition of ichthyosis.

Ichthyosis is a chronic, hypertrophic disease, characterized by dryness
and scaliness of the skin, with a variable amount of papillary
growth.


At what age is ichthyosis first observed?

It is first noticed in infancy or early childhood. In rare instances
it is congenital (ichthyosis congenita), and in such cases it is usually
severe, and of a grave type; the children are, as a rule, prematurely
born, and frequently do not survive many days or weeks.


What extent of surface is involved?

Usually the whole surface, but it is most marked upon the extensor
surfaces of the arms and legs, especially at the elbows and
knees; the face and scalp, in mild cases, often remain free.


Name the two varieties of ichthyosis usually described.

Ichthyosis simplex and ichthyosis hystrix, terms commonly employed
to designate the mild and severe forms respectively.


Describe the clinical appearances of ichthyosis.

The milder forms of the disease may be so slight as to give rise to
simple dryness or harshness of the skin (xeroderma); but as commonly
met with it is more developed, more or less marked scaliness in the
form of thin or somewhat thick epidermal plates being present. The
papill        of the skin are often slightly hypertrophied. In slight cases
the color of the scales is usually light and pearly; in the more marked
examples it is dark gray, olive green or black.

In the severe variety       ichthyosis hystrix       in addition to scaliness
there is marked papillary hypertrophy, forming warty or spinous
patches. This type is rare, and, as a rule, the surface involved is
more or less limited.


Are there any inflammatory symptoms in ichthyosis?

No. In fact, beyond the disfigurement, the disease causes no inconvenience;
in those well-marked cases, however, in which the scales
are thick and more or less immovable, the natural mobility of the
parts is compromised and fissuring often occurs. In the winter
[Pg 166]
months, in the severer cases, exposed parts may become slightly
eczematous.


Does ichthyosis vary somewhat with the season?

Yes. In all cases the disease is better in the warm months, and in
the mild forms may entirely disappear during this time. This favorable
change is purely mechanical       due to the maceration to which
the increased activity of the sweat glands gives rise.


Is the general health affected in ichthyosis?

No.


What course does ichthyosis pursue?

Chronic. Beginning in early infancy or childhood, it usually becomes
gradually more marked until adult age, after which time it, as a
rule, remains stationary.


What is the etiology?

Beyond a hereditary influence, which is often a positive factor, the
causes are obscure. It is not a common disease.


State the pathology.

Anatomically the essential feature is epidermic hypertrophy, with
usually a varying degree of papillary hypertrophy also.


Mention the diagnostic features of ichthyosis.

The harsh, dry skin, epidermic and papillary hypertrophy, the
furfuraceous or plate-like scaliness, the greater development upon
the extensor surfaces, a history of the affection dating from early
childhood, and the absence of inflammatory symptoms.


How is ichthyosis to be distinguished from eczema, psoriasis,
and other scaly inflammatory diseases?

By the absence of the inflammatory element.


What is the outlook for a case of ichthyosis?

The prognosis is unfavorable as regards a cure, but the process
may usually be kept in abeyance or rendered endurable by proper
measures.


What treatment would you prescribe for ichthyosis?

Treatment that has in view removal of the scaliness and the
maintenance of a soft and flexible condition of the skin.
[Pg 167]

In mild cases frequent warm baths, simple or alkaline, will suffice;
in others an application of an oily or fatty substance, such as the
ordinary oils or ointments, made several hours or immediately before
the bath may be necessary. In moderately developed cases the skin
is to be washed energetically with sapo viridis and hot water, followed
by a warm bath, after which an oily or fatty application is
made. In some of the more severe cases the following plan is
often useful: The parts are first rubbed with a soapy ointment consisting
of one part of precipitated sulphur and seven parts of sapo
viridis; a bath is then taken, the skin wiped dry, and a one to five
per cent. ointment of salicylic acid gently rubbed in.

Glycerine lotions, one or two drachms to the ounce of water, are
also beneficial; as also the following:       


          Ac. salicylici, .................................. gr. x-xl
    Glycerini, .......................................       ss-      j
    Lanolin,
    Petrolati, .....................................                    ss


In severe cases of ichthyosis hystrix it may be necessary, also, to
employ caustics or the knife.


What systemic treatment would you prescribe?

Constitutional remedies are practically powerless; occasionally
some good is accomplished by the internal administration of linseed
oil and jaborandi.


Onychauxis.

(Synonym: Hypertrophy of the Nail.)


Describe onychauxis.

Onychauxis, or hypertrophy of the nail, may take place in one
or all directions, and this increase may be, and often is, accompanied
by changes in shape, color, and direction of growth. One or all the
nails may share in the process. As the result of lateral deviation
of growth, the nail presses upon the surrounding tissues, producing
a varying degree of inflammation       paronychia.


What is the etiology of hypertrophy of the nail?

The condition may be either congenital or acquired. In the latter
[Pg 168]
instances it is usually the result of the extension to the matrix of
such cutaneous diseases as psoriasis and eczema; or it is produced by
constitutional maladies, such as syphilis.


Give the treatment of hypertrophy of the nail.

Treatment consists in the removal of the redundant nail-tissue by
means of the knife or scissors; and, when dependent upon eczema
or psoriasis, the employment of remedies suitable for these diseases.
When it is the result of syphilis, the medication appropriate to this
disease is to be employed.

In paronychia the nail should be frequently trimmed and a pledget
of lint or cotton be interposed between the edge of the nail and the
adjacent soft parts; astringent powders and lotions may often be
employed with advantage; and in severe and persistent cases excision
of the nail, partial or complete, may be found necessary.


Hypertrichosis.

(Synonyms: Hirsuties; Hypertrophy of the Hair; Superfluous Hair.)


What is meant by hypertrichosis?

Hypertrichosis is a term applied to excessive growth of hair,
either as regards region, extent, age or sex.


Describe the several conditions met with.

The unnatural hair growth may be slight, as, for instance, upon a
n       vus (n       vus pilosus); or it may be excessive, as in the so-called
hairy people (homines pilosi); or it may also appear on the face,
arms and other parts in females, resulting from a hypertrophy of the
natural lanugo hairs.


State the causes of hypertrichosis.

Hereditary influence is often a factor; the condition may also be
congenital.

If acquired, the tendency manifests itself usually toward middle
life. In women, it is not infrequently associated with diseases of the
utero-ovarian system; in many instances, however, there is no apparent
cause. Local irritation or stimulation has at times a causative
influence.
[Pg 169]


How is hypertrichosis to be treated?

For general hypertrichosis there is no remedy. Small hairy n       vi
may be excised, or, as also in the larger hairy moles, the hairs may
be removed by electrolysis.

On the faces of women, if the hairs are coarse or large, electrolysis
constitutes the only satisfactory method; if the hairs are small and
lanugo-like, the operation is not to be advised. It is somewhat
painful, but never unbearable. In the past several years the x-ray
has been advocated by several writers, but it requires usually numerous
exposures pushed to the point of producing erythema; it is not
without risk, and the hairs are said to return in some months.


What temporary methods are usually resorted to for the
removal of superfluous hair?

Shaving, extraction of the hairs and the use of depilatories. As
a depilatory, a powder made up of two drachms of barium sulphide
and three drachms each of zinc oxide and starch, is commonly (and
cautiously) employed; at the time of application enough water is
added to the powder to make a paste, and it is then spread thinly
upon the parts, allowed to remain five to fifteen minutes, or until
heat of skin or a burning sensation is felt, washed off thoroughly,
and a soothing ointment applied. This preparation must be well
prepared to be efficient.


Describe the method of removal of superfluous hair by electrolysis.

A fine needle in a suitable handle is attached to the negative pole
of a galvanic battery, introduced into the hair-follicle to the depth
of the papilla, and the circuit completed by the patient touching the
positive electrode; in several seconds slight blanching and frothing
usually appear at the point of insertion; a few seconds later the
current is broken by release of the positive electrode, and the needle
is then withdrawn. Sometimes a wheal-like elevation arises, remains
several minutes or hours, and then disappears; or occasionally,
probably from secondary infection, it develops into a pustule.

A strength of current of a half to two milliamperes is usually
sufficient; the time necessary for the destruction of the papilla
varying from several to thirty seconds.
[Pg 170]


How are you to know if the papilla has been destroyed?

The hair will readily come out with but little, if any, traction.


What is the result if the current has been too strong or too
long continued?

The follicle suppurates and a scar results.


Why should contiguous hairs not be operated upon at the
same sitting?

In order that the chances of marked inflammatory action and
scarring (always possibilities) may be reduced to a minimum.


In case of failure to destroy an individual papilla, should a
second attempt be made at the same sitting?

As a rule not, in order to avoid the possibility of too much destructive
action, and consequent scarring.


Can scarring always be prevented?

In the average case, with skill and care, the use of an exceedingly
fine needle and the avoidance of too strong a current, perceptible
scarring (scarring perceptible to the ordinary observer or at ordinary
distance) need rarely occur.


What measures are to be advised for the irritation produced
by the operation?

Hot-water applications and the use of an ointment made of two
drachms cold cream and ten grains of boric acid are of advantage not
only in reducing the resulting hyper       mia, but also in preventing
suppuration and consequent scarring. To lessen the chances of the
latter, cleansing the parts with alcohol just before and after the
operation is also of service.


       dema Neonatorum.


Describe        dema neonatorum.

The essential symptoms are        dema and a variable degree of hardness
and induration. It develops in the first few days of life, and
usually upon the extremities, especially the lower. It may remain
more or less limited to these parts, but, as a rule, slowly extends.
[Pg 171]
The skin is of a yellowish, dusky, or livid color, and sometimes glossy
or shining. There are general symptoms of drowsiness, subnormal
temperature, weakened circulation, and impaired respiration, which
gradually increase, and in eighty to ninety per cent. of the cases lead
to death. It is believed to be similar to anasarca in the adult and
to be due to like causes.

Treatment consists in maintaining the body-heat, sufficient and
proper nourishment and stimulation.


Sclerema Neonatorum.

(Synonyms: Scleroderma Neonatorum; Sclerema of the Newborn.)


What is sclerema neonatorum?

Sclerema neonatorum is a disease of infancy, showing itself usually
at or shortly after birth, and is characterized by a diffuse stiffness
and rigidity of the integument, accompanied by coldness,        dema,
discoloration, lividity and general circulatory disturbance.


Describe the symptoms, course, nature and treatment of
sclerema neonatorum.

As a rule the disease first manifests itself upon the lower extremities,
and then gradually, but usually rapidly, invades the trunk, arms
and face. The surface is cold. The skin, which is noted to be
reddish, purplish or mottled, is        dematous, stiff and tense; in consequence
the infant is unable to move, respires feebly and usually
perishes in a few days or weeks. In extremely exceptional instances
the disease, after involving a small part, may retrogress and recovery
take place.

The disease is rare, and in most cases is found associated with
pneumonia and with affections of the circulatory apparatus.

Treatment should be directed toward maintaining warmth and
proper alimentation.
[Pg 172]


Scleroderma.

(Synonyms: Sclerema; Scleriasis; Dermatosclerosis; Morph       a;
Keloid of Addison.)


What is scleroderma?

Scleroderma is an acute or chronic disease of the skin characterized
by a localized or general, more or less diffuse, usually pigmented,
rigid, stiffened, indurated or hide-bound condition.

Morph       a, by some formerly thought to be a distinct affection, is
now believed to be a form of scleroderma; as typically met with it
is characterized by one or more rounded, oval, or elongate, coin- to
palm-sized, pinkish, or whitish ivory-looking patches. In some
instances such patches are seen in association with the more classic
type of scleroderma just defined.


Describe the symptoms of ordinary scleroderma.

The disease may be acute or chronic, usually the latter. A portion
or almost the entire surface may be involved, or it may occupy
variously sized and shaped areas. The integument becomes more
or less rigid and indurated, hard to the touch, hide-bound, and in
marked cases immobile.        dema may, especially in the more acute
cases, precede the induration. Pigmentation, of a yellowish or
brownish color, is often a precursory and accompanying symptom.
The skin feels tight and contracted, and in some instances numbness
and cramp-like pains are complained of.


Describe the variety known as morph       a.

The patches (one, several, or more), occurring most frequently
about the trunk, are in the beginning usually slightly hyper       mic,
later becoming pale-yellowish or white, and having a pinkish or lilac
border made up of minute capillaries. They are, as a rule, sharply
defined, with a smooth, often shining and atrophic-looking surface;
are soft, fine or leathery to the touch, on a level or somewhat depressed,
and appearing not unlike a piece of bacon or ivory laid in
the skin. Occasionally the patches are noted to occur over nerve-tracts.
The adjacent skin may be normal or there may be more or
[Pg 173]
less yellowish or brownish mottling. The subjective symptoms of
tingling, itching, numbness, and even pain, may or may not be
present.


What is the course of the disease?

Sooner or later, usually after months or years, the disease ends in
resolution and recovery, or in marked atrophic changes, causing
contraction and deformity. As a rule, the general health remains
good.


State the causes of scleroderma.

The condition is to be considered as probably of neurotic origin.
Exposure and shock to the nervous system are to be looked upon as
influential. It is a rare disease, observed usually in early adult or
middle life, and is more frequent in women than in men.


What is the pathology?

In typical and advanced cases both the true skin and the
subcutaneous connective tissue show a marked increase of connective
tissue-element, with thickening and condensation of the
fibers.


Is there any difficulty in reaching a diagnosis in scleroderma?

As a rule, no. The characters       rigidity, stiffness, hardness, and
hide-bound condition of the skin       are always distinctive.

The peculiar appearance, the course and character of the patches,
of morph       a are quite distinctive.


Give the prognosis of scleroderma.

It should always be guarded. In many instances recovery takes
place, whilst in others the disease is rebellious, lasting indefinitely.
The prognosis of the variety known as morph       a is less unfavorable
than general scleroderma, and recovery more frequent.


What is the treatment of scleroderma?

Tonics, such as arsenic, quinia, nux vomica, and cod-liver oil;
conjointly with the local employment of stimulating, oily or fatty
applications, friction, and electricity. R      ntgen-ray treatment is
often of value, more especially in the morph       a type.
[Pg 174]


Elephantiasis.

(Synonyms: Elephantiasis Arabum; Pachydermia; Barbadoes Leg; Elephant
Leg.)


Give a descriptive definition of elephantiasis.

Elephantiasis is a chronic hypertrophic disease of the skin and
subcutaneous tissue characterized by enlargement and deformity,
lymphangitis, swelling,        dema, thickening, induration, pigmentation,
and more or less papillary growth.

Fig. 35.





Elephantiasis of moderate development.


What parts are commonly involved in elephantiasis?

Usually one or both legs; occasionally the genitalia; other parts
are seldom affected.


Describe the symptoms of elephantiasis.

The disease usually begins with recurrent (at intervals of months
or years) erysipelatous inflammation, with swelling, pain, heat, redness
and lymphangitis; after each attack the parts remain somewhat
[Pg 175]
increased in size, although at first not noticeably so. After months
or one or two years the enlargement or hypertrophy becomes conspicuous,
the part is chronically swollen,        dematous and hard; the
skin is thickened, the normal lines and folds exaggerated, the papill       
enlarged and prominent, and with more or less fissuring and pigmentation.


What is the further course of the disease?

There is gradual increase in size, the parts in some instances
reaching enormous proportions; the skin becomes rough and warty,
eczematous inflammation is often superadded, and, sooner or later,
ulcers, superficial or deep, form       which, together with the crusting
and moderate scaliness, present a striking picture. There may be
periods of comparative inactivity, or, after reaching a certain development,
the disease may, for a time at least, remain stationary.


Are there any subjective symptoms?

A variable degree of pain is often noted, especially marked during
the inflammatory attacks. The general health is not involved.


State the cause of elephantiasis.

The etiology is obscure. The disease rarely occurs before puberty.
It is most common in tropical countries, more especially among the
poor and neglected. It is not hereditary, nor can it be said to be
contagious. Inflammation and obstruction of the lymphatics, probably
due, according to late investigations, to the presence of large
numbers of filaria (microscopic thread-worms) in the lymph channels
and bloodvessels, is to be looked upon as the immediate cause.


What is the pathology?

All parts of the skin and subcutaneous connective-tissue are hypertrophied,
the lymphatic glands are swollen, the lymph channels
and bloodvessels enlarged, and there is more or less inflammation, with
       dema. Secondarily, from pressure, atrophy and destruction of the
skin-glands, and atrophic degeneration of the fat and muscles result.


What are the diagnostic characters of beginning elephantiasis?

Recurrent erysipelatous inflammation, attended with gradual enlargement
of the parts.
[Pg 176]

The appearances, later in the course of the disease, are so characteristic
that a mistake is scarcely possible.


Give the prognosis of elephantiasis.

If the case comes under treatment in the first months of its development,
the process may probably be checked or held in abeyance;
when well established, rarely more than palliation is possible.


What is the treatment of elephantiasis?

The inflammatory attacks are to be treated on general principles.
Quinia, potassium iodide, iron and other tonics are occasionally useful;
and, especially in the earlier stages, climatic change is often of
value. Between the inflammatory attacks the parts are to be
rubbed with an ointment of iodine or mercury, together with galvanization
of the involved part.

In elephantiasis of the leg, a roller or rubber bandage, or the
gum stocking, is to be worn; compression and ligation of the main
artery, and even excision of the sciatic nerve, have all been employed,
with more or less diminution in size as a result. In
elephantiasis of the genitalia, if the disease is well advanced, excision
or amputation of the parts is to be practised.

Eczematous inflammation, if present, is to be treated with the
ordinary remedies.



Dermatolysis.

(Synonym: Cutis Pendula.)


Give a descriptive definition of dermatolysis.

Dermatolysis is a rare disease, consisting of hypertrophy and looseness
of the skin and subcutaneous connective tissue, with a tendency
to hang in folds.


Describe the symptoms and course of dermatolysis.

It may be congenital or acquired, and maybe limited to a small or
large area, or develop simultaneously at several regions. All parts
of the skin, including the follicles, glands and subcutaneous connective
and areolar tissue, share in the hypertrophy; and this in exceptional
instances may be so extensive that the integument hangs in
folds. The enlargement of the follicles, natural folds and rug       
gives rise to an uneven surface, but the skin remains soft and
[Pg 177]
pliable. There is also increased pigmentation, the integument
becoming more or less brownish.


What course does dermatolysis pursue?

Its development is slow and usually progressive. It gives rise to
no further inconvenience than its weight and consequent discomfort.


Give the etiology.

The etiology is obscure. It is considered by some authors as allied
to molluscum fibrosum, and, in fact, as a manifestation of that disease,
ordinary molluscum tumors sometimes being associated with it.
It is not malignant.


What is the pathology?

The disease consists of a simple hypertrophy of all the skin structures
and the subcutaneous connective tissue.


What is the treatment of dermatolysis?

Excision when advisable and practicable.




CLASS V.       ATROPHIES.


Albinismus.


What do you understand by albinismus?

Congenital absence, either partial or complete, of the pigment
normally present in the skin, hair and eyes.


Describe complete albinismus.

In complete albinismus the skin of the entire body is white, the
hair very fine, soft and white or whitish-yellow in color, the irides
are colorless or light blue, and the pupils, owing to the absence of
pigment in the choroid, are red; this absence of pigment in the
eyes gives rise to photophobia and nystagmus. Albinos       a term
applied to such individuals       are commonly of feeble constitution,
and may exhibit imperfect mental development.


Describe partial albinismus.

Partial albinismus is met with most frequently in the colored race.
In this form of the affection the pigment is absent in one, several or
[Pg 178]
more variously-sized patches; usually the hairs growing thereon
are likewise colorless.


Is there any structural change in the skin?

No. The functions of the skin are performed in a perfectly
natural manner, and microscopical examination shows no departure
from normal structure save the complete absence of pigment.


What is known in regard to the etiology?

Nothing is known of the causes producing albinismus beyond the
single fact that it is frequently hereditary.


Does albinismus admit of treatment?

No; the condition is without remedy.


Vitiligo.

(Synonyms: Leucoderma; Leucopathia.)


Give a definition of vitiligo.

Vitiligo may be defined as a disease involving the pigment of the
skin alone, characterized by several or more progressive, milky-white
patches surrounded by increased pigmentation.


Describe the symptoms of vitiligo.

The disease may begin at one or more regions, the backs of the
hands, trunk and face being favorite parts; its appearance is usually
insidious, and the spots may not be especially noticeable until they
are the size of a pea or larger. The patches grow slowly, are milky
or dead white, smooth, non-elevated, and of rounded outline; the
bordering skin is darker than normal, showing increased pigmentation.
Several contiguous spots may coalesce and form a large,
irregularly-shaped patch. Hair growing on the involved skin may
or may not be blanched.

There are no subjective symptoms.


What course does vitiligo pursue?

The course of the disease is slow, months and sometimes years
elapsing before it reaches conspicuous development. It may after a
time remain stationary, or, in rare instances, retrogress; as a rule,
however, it is progressive. Exceptionally, the greater part, or even
the whole surface may eventually be involved.
[Pg 179]


Give the etiology of vitiligo.

Disturbed innervation is thought to be influential. The disease
develops often without apparent cause. Alopecia areata and morph       a
have been observed associated with it.

Fig. 36.





Vitiligo.


State the pathology of vitiligo.

The disease consists, anatomically, of both a diminution and increase
of the pigment       the white patch resulting from the former,
and the pigmented borders from the latter. There is no textural
change, the skin in other respects being normal.


From what diseases is vitiligo to be differentiated?

From morph       a and from the an       sthetic patches of leprosy.


In what respects do these diseases differ from vitiligo?

In morph       a there is textural change, and in leprosy both textural
change and constitutional or other symptoms.
[Pg 180]

What prognosis is to be given?

It should always be guarded, the disease in almost all cases being
irresponsive to treatment.


What is the treatment of vitiligo?

The general health is to be looked after, and remedies directed
especially toward the nervous system to be employed. Arsenic, in
small and continued doses, seems at times to have an influence; when
there is lack of general tone it may be prescribed as follows:       


          Liq. potassii arsenitis, ........................ f      j
    Tinct. nucis vom., .............................. f      iij
    Elix. calisay       , ............... q.s. ad. ........ f       iv.   M.
  SIG.       f      j t.d.


Suprarenal-gland preparations in moderate dosage long continued
has appeared in a few instances to be of some benefit.

When upon exposed parts, stimulation of the patches, with the
view of producing hyper       mia and consequent pigment deposit; conjoined
with suitable applications to the surrounding pigmented skin,
with a view to lessen the coloration (see treatment of chloasma), will
be of aid in rendering the disease less conspicuous. Or the condition
may be, in a measure, masked by staining the patches with walnut
juice or similar pigment.



Canities.

(Synonym: Grayness of the Hair.)


Describe canities.

Canities, or graying of the hair, may occur in localized areas or it
may be more or less general; the blanching may be slight, scarcely
amounting to slight grayness, or it may be complete. It is common
to advancing years (canities senilis); it is seen also exceptionally
in early life (canities pr       matura). The condition is usually permanent.
The loss of pigment takes place, as a rule, slowly, but several
apparently authentic cases have been reported in which the change
occurred in the course of a night or in a few days.


What is the etiology of canities?

The causes are obscure. Heredity is usually an influential factor,
[Pg 181]
and conditions which impair the general nutrition have at times an
etiological bearing. Intense anxiety, fright, and other profound nervous
shock are looked upon as causative in sudden graying of the
hair.


Give the treatment.

Canities is without remedy. Dyeing, although not to be advised,
is often practised, and the condition thus masked.



Alopecia.

(Synonym: Baldness.)


What do you understand by alopecia?

By alopecia is meant loss of hair, either partial or complete.


Name the several varieties of alopecia.

The so-called varieties are based mainly upon the etiology, and are
named congenital alopecia, premature alopecia and senile alopecia.


Describe congenital alopecia.

Congenital alopecia is a rare condition, in which the hair-loss is
usually noted to be patchy, or the general hair-growth may simply
be scanty. In rare instances the hair has been entirely wanting; in
such cases there is usually defective development of other structures,
such as the teeth.


Describe premature alopecia.

Loss of hair occurring in early and middle adult life is not uncommon,
and may consist of a simple thinning or of more or less complete
baldness of the whole or greater part of the scalp. It usually
develops slowly, some months or several years passing before the
condition is well established. It is often idiopathic, and without
apparent cause further than probably a hereditary predisposition. It
may also be symptomatic, as, for example, the loss of hair, usually
rapid (defluvium capillorum), following systemic diseases, such as the
various fevers, and syphilis; or as a result of a long-continued seborrh       a
or seborrh       ic eczema (alopecia furfuracea).


Describe senile alopecia.

This is the baldness so frequently seen developing with advancing
years, and may consist merely of a general thinning, or, more
[Pg 182]
commonly, a general thinning with a more or less complete baldness of
the temporal and anterior portion or of the vertex of the scalp.


What is the prognosis in the various varieties of alopecia?

In those cases in which there is a positive cause, as, for instance, in
symptomatic alopecia, the prognosis is, as a rule, favorable, especially
if no family predisposition exists. In the congenital and senile varieties
the condition is usually irremediable. In idiopathic premature
alopecia, the prognosis should be extremely guarded.


How would you treat alopecia?

By removing or modifying the predisposing factors by appropriate
constitutional remedies, and by the external use of stimulating
applications.


Name several remedies or combinations usually employed in
the local treatment.

Sulphur ointment, full strength or weakened with lard or vaseline;
a lotion of resorcin consisting of one or two drachms to four ounces
of alcohol, to which is added ten to thirty minims of castor oil; and
a lotion made up as follows:       


          Tinct. cantharidis, ............................. f      iv
    Tinct. capsici, ................................. f       j
    Ol. ricini, ..................................... f      ss-f      j
    Alcoholis, ................. q.s. ad. ........... f       iv.   M.


The following is sometimes beneficial:       


          Resorcin, ........................................ gr. lxxx
    Quinin        (alkaloid), .............................. gr. xv
    Ol. ricini, ......................................        v-       xx
    Alcoholis, ...................................... f       iv.  M.


Another excellent formula is:


          Resorcin, ........................................ gr. lxxx-cxx
    Ac. carbolici cryst., ............................ gr. xx
    Spts. myrci       , ................................... f       iv.   M.


And also the various other stimulating applications employed in
alopecia areata (q. v.).
[Pg 183]

Other measures of value are: Faradic electricity applied daily
for five minutes with a metallic brush or comb; daily massage,
with the object of loosening the skin and giving more freedom to
cutaneous and subcutaneous circulation; and the application, two
or three times weekly, of static electricity by means of the static
crown electrode.

(The application selected should be gently       not rubbing       applied
daily or every second or third day, according to the case; if a lotion,
moistening the parts with it; if an ointment, merely greasing the parts.
Shampooing every one to three weeks, according to circumstances.)



Alopecia Areata.

(Synonyms: Area Celsi; Alopecia Circumscripta.)


What do you understand by alopecia areata?

Fig. 37.





Alopecia Areata.

Alopecia areata is an affection of the hairy system, in which occur
one or more circumscribed, round or oval patches of complete baldness
unattended by any marked alteration in the skin.
[Pg 184]


Upon what parts and at what age does the disease occur?

In the large majority of cases the disease is limited to the scalp;
but it may invade other portions of the body, as the bearded region,
eyebrows, eyelashes, and, in rare instances, the entire integument.

It is most common between the ages of ten and forty.


Describe the symptoms of alopecia areata.

The disease begins either suddenly, without premonitory symptoms,
one or several patches being formed in a few hours; or, and as
is more usually the case, several days or weeks elapse before the bald
area or areas are sufficiently large to become noticeable. The patches
continue to extend peripherally for a variable period, and then remain
stationary, or several gradually coalesce and form a large, irregular
area involving the entire or a greater portion of the scalp. The skin
of the affected regions is smooth, faintly pink or milky white,

Fig. 38.






Alopecia Areata       complete hair loss.

and at first presents no departure from the normal; sooner or
later, however, the follicles become less prominent, and slight
atrophy or thinning may occur, the bald plaques being slightly
depressed.

Occasionally, usually about the periphery and in the early stages,
a few hair-stumps may be seen.
[Pg 185]


What course does alopecia areata pursue?

Almost invariably chronic. After the lapse of a variable period
the patches cease to extend, the hairs at the margins of the bald
areas being firmly fixed in the follicles; sooner or later a fine, colorless
lanugo or down shows itself, which may continue to grow until it
is about a half-inch or so in length and then drop out; or it may
remain, become coarser and pigmented, and the parts resume their
normal condition. Not infrequently, however, after growing for a
time, the new hair falls out, and this may happen several times
before the termination of the disease.


Are there any subjective symptoms in alopecia areata?

As a rule, not; but occasionally the appearance of the patches is
preceded by severe headache, itching or burning, or other manifestations
of disturbed innervation.


State the cause of alopecia areata.

The etiology is obscure. Two theories as to the cause of the disease
exist: one of these regards it as parasitic, and the other considers
it to be trophoneurotic. Doubtless both are right, as a study
of the literature would indicate that there are, as regards etiology,
really two varieties       the contagious and the non-contagious. In
America examples of the contagious variety are uncommon.


Does the skin undergo any alterative or destructive changes?

Microscopical examination of the skin of the diseased area shows
little or no alteration in its structure beyond slight thinning.


How do you distinguish alopecia areata from ringworm?

The plaques of alopecia areata are smooth, often completely
devoid of hair, and free from scales; while those of ringworm
show numerous broken hairs and stumps, desquamation, and usually
symptoms of mild inflammatory action. In doubtful cases recourse
should be had to the microscope.


What is the prognosis in alopecia areata?

The disease is often rebellious, but in children and young adults
the prognosis is almost invariably favorable, permanent loss of hair
being uncommon. The same holds true, but to a much less extent,
with the disease as occurring in those of more advanced age. In
extensive cases       those in which the hair of the entire scalp finally
[Pg 186]
entirely disappears, and sometimes involves all hairy parts       the
prognosis is unfavorable. Only exceptionally does recovery ensue
in such instances.

The uncertain duration, however, must be borne in mind; months,
and in some instances several years, may elapse before complete
restoration of hair takes place. Relapses are not uncommon.


How is alopecia areata treated?

By both constitutional and local measures, the former having in
view the invigoration of the nervous system, and the latter a stimulating
and parasiticidal action of the affected areas.


Give the constitutional treatment.

Arsenic is perhaps the most valuable remedy, while quinine, nux
vomica, pilocarpine, cod-liver oil and ferruginous tonics may, in suitable
cases, often be administered with benefit.


Name several remedies or combinations employed in the
external treatment of alopecia areata.

Ointments of tar and sulphur of varying strength; the various
mercurial ointments; the tar oils, either pure or with alcohol;
stimulating lotions, containing varying proportions, singly or in
combination, of tincture of capsicum, tincture of cantharides, aqua
ammoni       , and oil of turpentine. The following is a safe formula,
especially in dispensary and ignorant class practice:


                -naphthol, ......................................       ss-      j
      Ol. cadini, ....................................       j
    Ungt. sulphuris, ................. q.s. ad. ......        j   M.


The cautious use of a five to twenty per cent. chrysarobin ointment
is of value. Painting the patches with pure carbolic acid or trikresol
every ten days or two weeks sometimes acts well; it should
not be applied over large areas nor used in young children. Galvanization
or faradization of the affected parts may also be employed,
and with, occasionally, beneficial effect. Stimulation with
the high-frequency current by means of the vacuum electrode is
also of value. When practicable, the Finsen light can be applied
with hope of benefit and cure.
[Pg 187]


Atrophia Pilorum Propria.

(Synonym: Atrophy of the Hair.)


What do you understand by atrophy of the hair?

An atrophic, brittle, dry condition of the hair, and which may be
either symptomatic or idiopathic.


Describe the several conditions met with.

As a symptomatic affection, the dry, brittle condition of the hair
met with in seborrh       a, in severe constitutional diseases, and in the
various vegetable parasitic affections, may be referred to.

As an idiopathic disease it is rare, consisting simply of a brittleness
and an uneven and irregular formation of the hair-shaft, with a
tendency to split up into filaments (fragilitas crinium); or there may
be localized swelling and bursting of the hair-shaft, the nodes thus
produced having a shining, semi-transparent appearance (trichorrhexis
nodosa). This latter usually occurs upon the beard and
moustache.


State the causes of atrophy of the hair.

The causes of the symptomatic variety are usually evident; the
etiology of idiopathic atrophy is obscure, but by many is thought
due to parasitism.


Fig. 39.




Trichorrhexis Nodosa. (After Michelson.)


What would be your prognosis and treatment in atrophy of
the hair?

Symptomatic atrophy usually responds to proper measures, but
always slowly; treatment is based upon the etiological factors.

For the idiopathic disease little, as a rule, can be done; repeated
shaving or cutting the hair has, in exceptional instances, been followed
by favorable results.
[Pg 188]


Atrophia Unguis.

(Synonyms: Atrophy of the Nails; Onychatrophia.)


Describe atrophy of the nails.

The nails are soft, thin and brittle, splitting easily, and are often
opaque and lustreless, and may have a worm-eaten appearance.
Several or more are usually affected.


State the causes of atrophy of the nails.

The condition may be congenital or acquired, usually the latter.
It may result from trauma, or be produced by certain cutaneous
diseases, notably eczema and psoriasis; or it may follow injuries or
diseases of the nerves. Syphilis and chronic wasting constitutional
diseases may also interfere with the normal growth of the nail-substance,
producing varying degrees of atrophy. The fungi of tinea
trichophytina and tinea favosa at times invade these structures
and lead to more or less complete disintegration       onychomycosis.


Fig. 40.




Atrophy of the Nails.


What is the treatment of atrophy of the nails?

Treatment will depend upon the cause. When it is due to eczema
[Pg 189]
or psoriasis, appropriate constitutional and local remedies should be
prescribed. If it is the result of syphilis, mercury and potassium
iodide are to be advised. In onychomycosis       an exceedingly obstinate
affection       the nails should be kept closely cut and pared, and a
one- to five-grain solution of corrosive sublimate applied several times
a day; a lotion of sodium hyposulphite, a drachm to the ounce, is
also a valuable and safe application.


Atrophia Cutis.

(Synonyms: Atrophoderma; Atrophy of the Skin.)


What do you understand by atrophy of the skin?

By atrophy of the skin is meant an idiopathic or symptomatic
wasting or degeneration of its component elements.


State the several conditions met with.

Glossy skin, general idiopathic atrophy of the skin, parchment
skin, atrophic lines and spots, senile atrophy, and the atrophy following
certain cutaneous diseases.


Describe glossy skin (atrophoderma neuriticum), and state
the treatment.

Glossy skin is a rare condition following an injury or disease
of the nerve. It is usually seen about the fingers. The skin is
hairless, faintly reddish, smooth and shining, with a varnished
and thin appearance, and with a tendency to fissuring. More or
less severe and persistent burning pain precedes and accompanies
the atrophy.

Protective applications are called for, the disease tending slowly
to spontaneous disappearance.


Describe general idiopathic atrophy of the skin, and give the
treatment.

General idiopathic atrophy of the skin is extremely rare, and is
characterized by a gradual, more or less general, degenerative and
quantitative atrophy of the skin structures, accompanied usually with
more or less discoloration and pigmentation.

Treatment is palliative and based upon indications.
[Pg 190]


Describe parchment skin, and state the treatment.

Parchment skin (xeroderma pigmentosum, angioma pigmentosum
et atrophicum) is a rare disease, the exact nature of which is not
understood. It is characterized by the appearance of numerous
disseminated, freckle-like pigment-spots, telangiectases, atrophied
muscles, more or less shrinking and contraction of the integument,
and followed, in most instances, by epitheliomatous tumors and
ulceration, and finally death. It is usually slow in its course, beginning
in childhood and lasting for years. It is not infrequently seen
in several children of the same family.

Treatment is palliative, consisting, if necessary, of the use of
protective applications and of the administration of tonics and
nutrients.


Describe atrophic lines and spots.

Atrophic lines and spots (stri        et macul        atrophic       ) may be idiopathic
or symptomatic, the lesions consisting of scar-like or atrophic-looking,
whitish lines and macules, most commonly seen on the
trunk. They are smooth and glistening. Slight hyper       mia usually
precedes their formation. As an idiopathic disease its course is
insidious and slow, and its progress eventually stayed. The so-called
line        albicantes, resulting from the stretching of the skin produced
by pregnancy or tumors, and from rapid development of fat, may
be mentioned as illustrating the symptomatic variety.

In course of time the atrophy becomes less conspicuous.


Describe senile atrophy.

Senile atrophy is not uncommon, the atrophy resulting, as the
name inferentially implies, from advancing age. It is characterized
by thinning and wasting, dryness, and a wrinkled condition, with
more or less pigmentation and loss of hair. Circumscribed pigmentary
deposits and seborrh       a, with degeneration, are also noted.


What several diseases of the skin are commonly followed by
atrophic changes?

Favus, lupus, syphilis, leprosy, scleroderma and morph       a.
[Pg 191]



CLASS VI.       NEW GROWTHS.


Keloid.

(Synonyms: Keloid of Alibert; Cheloid.)


Give a descriptive definition of keloid.

Keloid is a fibro-cellular new growth of the corium appearing as
one or several variously-sized, irregularly-shaped, elevated, smooth,
firm, pinkish or pale-reddish cicatriform lesions.


Describe the clinical appearance of keloid.

The growth begins as a small, hard, elevated, pinkish or reddish
tubercle, increasing gradually, several months or years usually elapsing
before the tumor reaches conspicuous size. When developed, it
is one or more inches in diameter, is sharply defined, elevated, hard,
rounded or oval, fungoid or crab-shaped, and firmly implanted in
the skin. It is usually pinkish, pearl-white, or reddish, commonly
devoid of hair, with no tendency to scaliness, and with, usually,
several vessels coursing over it. In some instances it is tender, and
it may be spontaneously painful.

The breast, especially over the sternal region, is a favorite site
for its appearance. One, several or more may be present in the
single case.


What course does keloid pursue?

Chronic; usually lasting throughout life. In rare instances spontaneous
involution takes place.


State the etiology of keloid.

The causes are obscure. The growth usually takes its start from
some injury or lesion of continuity; for instance, at the site of burns,
cuts, acne and smallpox scars, etc.       cicatricial keloid, false keloid;
or it may also, so it is thought, originate in normal skin       spontaneous
keloid, true keloid.


What is the pathology of keloid?

The lesion is a connective-tissue new growth having its seat in the
corium.
[Pg 192]


Is there any difficulty in the diagnosis of keloid?

No. It resembles hypertrophic scar; but this latter, which is
essentially keloidal, never extends beyond the line of injury.


Give the prognosis.

The growth is persistent and usually irresponsive to treatment.
In some cases, however, there is eventually a tendency to spontaneous
retrogression, up to a certain point at least.


What is the treatment of keloid?

Usually palliative, consisting of the continuous application of an
ointment such as the following:       


          Acidi salicylici, ................................ gr. x-xx
    Emplast. plumbi,
    Emplast. saponis, ....................            ..........       iij
    Petrolati, .......................................       ij.   M.


An ointment of ichthyol, twenty-five per cent. strength, rubbed
in once or twice daily, is sometimes beneficial.

Operative measures, such as punctate and linear scarification,
electrolysis and excision, are occasionally practised, but the results
are rarely satisfactory and permanent; not infrequently, indeed,
renewed activity in the progress of the growth is noted to follow.
The x-ray can be tried with some hope of improvement. The administration
of thyroid has been thought to have a possible influence
in some instances.


Fibroma.

(Synonyms: Molluscum Fibrosum; Fibroma Molluscum.)


What do you understand by fibroma?

Fibroma is a connective-tissue new growth characterized by one or
more sessile or pedunculated, pea- to egg-sized or larger, soft or firm,
rounded, painless tumors, seated beneath and in the skin.


Describe the clinical appearances of fibroma.

The growth may be single, in which case it is apt to be pedunculated
or pendulous, and attain considerable dimensions; as a result
of weight or pressure surface-ulceration may occur. Or, as commonly
met with, the lesions are numerous, scattered over large surface, and
[Pg 193]
vary in size from a pea to a cherry; the overlying skin being normal,
pinkish or reddish, loose, stretched, hypertrophied or atrophied.

The tumors are painless. The general health is not involved.

Fig. 41.



Fibroma. (After Octerlony.)


What is the course of fibroma?

Chronic and persistent.
[Pg 194]


What is the etiology of fibroma?

The cause is not known. Heredity is often noted. The affection
is not common.


State the pathology of fibroma.

The growths are variously thought to have their origin in the
connective tissue of the corium, or in that of the walls of the hair-sac,
or in the connective-tissue framework of the fatty tissue.
Recent tumors are composed of gelatinous, newly-formed connective
tissue, and the older growths of a dense, firmly-packed, fibrous tissue.


From what growths is fibroma to be differentiated?

From molluscum contagiosum, neuroma and lipoma; the first is
differentiated by its central aperture or depression, neuroma by its
painfulness, and lipoma by its lobulated character and soft feel.


Give the prognosis of fibroma.

The disease is persistent, and irresponsive to all treatment save
operative measures.


What is the treatment of fibroma?

Treatment consists, when desired and practicable, in the removal
of the growths by the knife, or in large and pedunculated tumors
by the ligature or by the galvano-cautery.

Neuroma.


Describe neuroma.

Neuroma of the skin is an exceedingly rare disease, characterized by
the formation of variously-sized, usually numerous, firm, immovable
and elastic fibrous tubercles containing new nerve-elements, and accompanied
by violent, paroxysmal pain. Their growth is slow and
usually progressive. Later they are painful upon pressure. They
are limited to one region.

The tumors are seated in the corium, extending into the deeper
structure, and consist of nerve-fibres, yellow elastic tissue, blood vessels
and lymphoid cells.

In the two cases reported, excision of the nerve-trunk gave, in
one instance, permanent relief; in the other the effect was only
temporary.
[Pg 195]


Xanthoma.

(Synonyms: Vitiligoidea; Xanthelasma.)


What is xanthoma?

Xanthoma is a connective-tissue new growth characterized by the
formation of yellowish, circumscribed, irregularly-shaped, variously-sized,
non-indurated, flat or raised patches or tubercles.


Name the two varieties met with.

The macular or flat (xanthoma planum) and the tubercular
(xanthoma tuberculatum or tuberosum). In some instances both
varieties (xanthoma multiplex) are seen in the same individual.


Describe the clinical appearances of xanthoma planum.

The macular or flat variety is usually seen about the eyelids.
It consists of one, several or more small or large, smooth, opaque,
sharply-defined, often slightly raised, yellowish patches, looking not
unlike pieces of chamois-skin implanted in the skin.


Describe the clinical appearances of xanthoma tuberosum.

The tubercular variety is commonly met with upon the neck,
trunk and extremities. It occurs as small, raised, isolated, yellowish
nodules, or as patches made up of aggregations of millet-seed-sized
or larger tubercles. The lesions may be few or they may exist in
great numbers.


What is the course of xanthoma?

Extremely slow; after reaching a certain development the growths
may remain stationary.


State the etiology of xanthoma.

The causes are obscure. Jaundice not infrequently precedes and
accompanies its development, especially in the tubercular variety.
The disease is uncommon, and is usually seen in middle and advanced
life, and more frequently in women. In some cases (xanthoma
diabeticorum) of general xanthoma diabetes is the causative factor.


What is the pathology of xanthoma?

It is a benign, connective-tissue new growth, with concomitant or
subsequent, but usually partial, fatty degeneration.
[Pg 196]


Give the prognosis of xanthoma.

The condition is persistent, and usually irresponsive to all treatment
save destructive or operative measures.

What is the treatment of xanthoma?

Treatment consists, in suitable cases, of excision; in some instances,
electrolysis is serviceable. Applications of trichloracetic acid
cautiously made are sometimes of value. In that form of general
xanthoma due to diabetes the treatment of this latter condition
will materially and sometimes completely remove the eruption.


Myoma.

(Synonyms: Myoma Cutis; Dermatomyoma; Liomyoma Cutis.)


Describe myoma.

The disease is rare, and consists usually of one or several (exceptionally
numerous), variously-sized tumors of the skin, made up of
smooth muscular fibres. They are flat, rounded, oval or pedunculated,
and have a smooth surface and a pale-red color; as a rule,
they are painless.

The growth is benign, and consists essentially of a new formation
of unstriped muscular fibres; but it may also be composed largely
of connective tissue (fibromyoma); or it may contain an abundance
of bloodvessels (myoma telangiectodes, angiomyoma); or there may
be lymphatic involvement (lymphangiomyoma).


Angioma.

(Synonyms: N       vus Vasculosus; N       vus Sanguineus.)


Give a definition of angioma.

Angioma is a congenital hypertrophy of the vascular tissues of the
corium and subcutaneous tissue. Exceptionally it makes its appearance
a few weeks or a month after birth.


Into what two classes may angiomata be roughly grouped?

The flat (or non-elevated) and the prominent (or elevated).


Describe the flat, or non-elevated, variety of angioma.

The flat, or non-elevated, angioma (n       vus flammeus, n       vus simplex,
angioma simplex, capillary n       vus) may be pin-head- to bean-sized;
or it may involve an area of several inches in diameter, and,
[Pg 197]
exceptionally, a whole region. It is of a bright- or dark-red color,
and is met with most frequently about the face. In some instances
it extends after birth, reaches a certain size and then remains stationary;
occasionally, when involving a small area, it undergoes involution
and disappears.

The so-called port-wine mark is included in this group.


Describe the prominent, or elevated, variety of angioma.

The prominent variety (venous n       vus, angioma cavernosum, n       vus
tuberosus) is variously-sized, often considerably elevated, clearly-defined,
compressible, smooth or lobulated, and of a dark, purple
color; it may, also, be erectile and pulsating. The growth is usually
a single formation, and is met with upon all parts of the body.


What is the pathology of angioma?

It is a new growth, consisting of a variable hypertrophy of the
cutaneous and subcutaneous arterial and venous bloodvessels, with
or without an increase of the connective tissue.


Give the treatment of angioma.

In some instances, especially in infants, painting the parts repeatedly
with collodion or liquor plumbi subacetatis will act favorably.
For well-established, small, capillary n       vi electrolysis or puncturing
with a red-hot needle or with a needle charged with nitric acid may
be employed; for        port-wine mark        frequent and closely contiguous
electrolytic punctures are occasionally followed by a slight diminution
in color. For the prominent growths, vaccination, the ligature,
puncturing with the galvano-cautery, and excision are variously
resorted to.

In recent years applications of liquid air and carbon dioxide have
proved of service in some cases.


Telangiectasis.


Describe telangiectasis.

Telangiectasis consists of a new growth or enlargement of the
cutaneous capillaries, usually appearing during middle adult life,
and seated, for the most part, about the face.


To what extent may telangiectasis develop?

It may be limited to a red dot or point, with several small radiating
[Pg 198]
capillaries (n       vus araneus, spider n       vus), or a whole region,
usually the face, may show numerous scattered or closely-set capillary
enlargements or new formations (rosacea). The latter is frequently
associated with acne (acne rosacea).

The etiology is obscure.


What is the treatment of telangiectasis?

Destruction of the vessels by electrolysis or by the knife. (See
treatment of acne rosacea.)


Lymphangioma.

(Synonym: Lymphangiectodes.)


Describe lymphangioma.

Lymphangioma is a rare disease, consisting of localized dilatations
of the lymphatic vessels, appearing as discrete or aggregated pin-head
or pea-sized, compressible, hollow, tubercle-like elevations, of
a pinkish or faint lilac color, and occurring for the most part about
the trunk. It is of slow but usually progressive development, and
is unaccompanied by subjective symptoms.

A rare condition, Kaposi described as lymphangioma tuberosum
multiplex, characterized by more or less solid, somewhat cystic,
pearly to pinkish red, sometimes crowded lesions, is now known to
be        benign cystic epithelioma       ; its most common site is the face.
While called        benign,        ulcerative action may eventually ensue.

Treatment, when demanded, consists of operative measures.


Rhinoscleroma.


Describe rhinoscleroma.

Rhinoscleroma is a rare and obscure disease, slow but progressive
in its course, characterized by the development of an irregular, dense
and hard, flattened, tubercular, non-ulcerating, cellular new growth,
having its seat about the nose and contiguous parts. The overlying
skin is normal in color, or it may be light- or dark-brown or reddish.
Marked disfigurement and closure, partial or complete, of the nasal
[Pg 199]
orifices gradually results. It is met with chiefly in Austria and
Germany.

Treatment, consisting of partial or complete extirpation, is rarely
permanent in its results, the disease tending to recur.


Lupus Erythematosus.

(Synonyms: Lupus Erythematodes; Lupus Sebaceus; Seborrh       a Congestiva.)


What is lupus erythematosus?

Lupus erythematosus may be roughly defined as a mildly to moderately
inflammatory superficial new-growth formation, characterized
by one, several, or more circumscribed, variously sized and shaped,
pinkish or dark red patches, covered slightly, and more or less irregularly,
with adherent grayish or yellowish scales.


Upon what parts is lupus erythematosus observed?

Its common site is the face, usually the nose and cheeks, with a
tendency toward symmetry; it is often limited to these parts, but
may occasionally be seen upon other regions, more especially the
lips, ears, and scalp. In rare instances a great part of the general
surface may become involved.


Describe the symptoms of lupus erythematosus.

Usually the disease begins as one or several rounded, circumscribed,
pin-head- to pea-sized lesions; slightly scaly, somewhat elevated, and
of a pinkish, reddish or violaceous color. They slowly, or somewhat
rapidly, increase in area, and after attaining variable size remain
stationary; or they may progress and coalesce, and in this manner
sooner or later involve considerable surface. The patches are sharply
defined against the sound skin by an elevated border, while the
central portion is somewhat depressed and usually atrophic. More
or less thickening and infiltration are observed. There is no tendency
to ulceration. The scaliness is, as a rule, scanty. The gland-ducts are
enlarged, patulous or plugged with sebaceous and epithelial matter.

The subjective symptoms of burning and itching are usually slight
and often wanting.


What course does lupus erythematosus pursue?

As a rule, the disease is persistent, although somewhat variable.
[Pg 200]
At times the patches retrogress, involution taking place with or
without slight sieve-like atrophy or scarring.


State the causes of lupus erythematosus.

The etiology is obscure. Some observers believe it to be a variety
of cutaneous tuberculosis. It is essentially a disease of adult and
middle age; is more common in women, and more frequent in those
having a tendency to disorders of the sebaceous glands. It may, in
fact, begin as a seborrh       a.


What is the pathology?

It was formerly considered a new growth, but recent opinion tends
toward regarding it as a chronic inflammation of the cutis, superinducing
degenerative and atrophic changes. Variable        dema of the
prickle layer and of the cutis is found. There is no tendency to
pus formation.


Fig. 42.





Lupus Erythematosus.


Is there any difficulty in the diagnosis of lupus erythematosus?

As a rule, not, as the features of the disease       the sharply circumscribed
outline, the reddish or violaceous color, the elevated border,
the tendency to central depression and atrophy, the plugged up or
patulous sebaceous ducts, the adherent grayish or yellowish scales,
[Pg 201]
together with the region attacked (usually the nose and cheeks)       
are characteristic.


State the prognosis of lupus erythematosus.

The disease is often capricious and extremely rebellious to treatment;
some cases, up to a certain point at least, yield readily, and
occasionally a tendency to spontaneous disappearance is observed;
a complete cure is, however, it must be confessed, rather rare. The
disease in nowise compromises the general health. In those rare
instances of generalized disease the patient has usually died from
an intercurrent tuberculosis.


How is lupus erythematosus to be treated?

The general health is to be looked after and systemic treatment
prescribed, if indicated. As a rule, constitutional remedies exert
little, if any, influence, but exceptionally, cod-liver oil, arsenic,
phosphorus, salicin, quinine, or potassium iodide proves of service.

Locally, according to the case, soothing remedies, stimulating applications
and destruction of the growth by caustics or operative
measures are to be employed. (Try the milder applications first.)


Mention the stimulating applications commonly employed.

Washing the parts energetically with tincture of sapo viridis, rinsing
and applying a soothing ointment, such as cold cream or vaseline.

A lotion containing zinc sulphate and potassium sulphuret
thoroughly dabbed on the parts morning and evening:       


          Zinci sulphatis,
    Potassii sulphurati, ................            ...........       i-      iv
    Glycerin       , .......................................        iv
    Aqu       , ........................................... f       iv.   M.


The calamine-and-zinc oxide lotion used in acute eczema is also
often extremely valuable.

Lotions of ichthyol and of resorcin, five to sixty grains to the
ounce; ichthyol in ointment, five- to twenty-per-cent. strength, is
also useful.

Painting the patches with pure carbolic acid; repeating a day or
two after the crusts have fallen off.

The continuous application of mercurial plaster.
[Pg 202]
Sulphur and tar ointments, officinal strength or weakened with
lard, and also the following:       


          Ol. cadini,
    Alcoholis,
    Saponis viridis, ..................            .............       iiss.   M.


(This is to be rubbed in, in small quantity, once or twice daily, and
later a soothing remedy applied.)

In recent years both the x-ray and Finsen light have been used
with variable success. Repeated applications of the high-frequency
current, with the vacuum electrode, have also proved serviceable.
Cautious applications of liquid air or carbon dioxide have also been
used with some success in the past few years.


When are destructive and operative measures justifiable?

In obstinate, sluggish, and long-persistent patches, and then only
after other methods of treatment have failed. (Remember that a
patch or patches of the disease may disappear in course of time
spontaneously, and occasionally without leaving a scar.)


State the methods of treatment commonly used in obstinate,
sluggish and persistent patches of lupus erythematosus.

Cauterization       with nitrate of silver, with applications of pyrogallic
acid in ointment or in liquor gutta-perch       , fifteen to thirty
per cent. strength, and with solutions (cautiously employed) of caustic
potash, and exceptionally with the galvano-cautery.

Fig. 43.



Single Scarifier.


Fig. 44.



Multiple Scarifier. (As modified by Van Harlingen.)

[Pg 203]
Operative       scarification, either punctate or linear, and erosion
with the curette. (See treatment of lupus vulgaris.)


Lupus Vulgaris.
(Synonyms: Lupus; Lupus Exedens; Lupus Vorax; Tuberculosis of the Skin.)


What do you understand by lupus vulgaris?

Lupus vulgaris is a cellular new growth, characterized by variously-sized,
soft, reddish-brown, papular, tubercular and infiltrated patches,
usually terminating in ulceration and scarring.


Upon what region is lupus vulgaris usually observed?

The face, especially the nose, but any part may be invaded. The
area involved may be small or quite extensive, usually the former.


At what age is the disease noted?

In many cases it begins in childhood or early adult life, but as it
is persistent and tends to relapse, it may be met with at any age.


Describe the earlier symptoms of lupus vulgaris.

The disease begins by the development of several or more pin-head
to small pea-sized, deep-seated, brownish-red or yellowish tubercles,
having their seat in the deeper part of the corium, and which are
somewhat softer and looser in texture than normal tissue. As the
disease progresses, variously-sized and shaped aggregations or patches
result, covered with thin and imperfectly-formed epidermis.


What changes do the lupus tubercles or infiltrations undergo?

The lesions, having attained a certain size or development, may
remain so for a time, but sooner or later retrogressive changes occur:
the matured papules or tubercles, or infiltrated patches, slowly disappear
by absorption, fatty degeneration, and exfoliation, leaving a
yellowish or brownish pigmentation, usually with more or less atrophy
or cicatricial-tissue formation       lupus exfoliativus; or disintegration
and destruction result, terminating in ulceration       lupus exedens,
lupus exulcerans. This latter is the more usual course.


Describe the clinical appearances and behavior of the lupus
ulcerations.

They are rounded, shallow excavations, with soft and reddish
borders. In exceptional instances exuberant granulations appear       
[Pg 204]
lupus hypertrophicus; or papillary outgrowths are noted       lupus verrucosus.
The ulcerations secrete a variable amount of pus, usually
slight in quantity, which leads to more or less crust formation; later,
however, cicatricial tissue, generally of a firm and fibrous character,
results.

Fig. 45.






Lupus of Arm.


In what manner does the disease spread?

The patches spread by the appearance of new tubercles, or infiltrations
at the peripheral portion. New islets and areas of disease
may continue to make their appearance from time to time, usually
upon contiguous parts.


Are the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat and larynx
ever involved?

In some instances, and either primarily or secondarily.







Lupus Vulgaris.






Lupus Vulgaris.

[Pg 205]

Is the bone tissue ever involved in lupus vulgaris?

No.


What course does lupus vulgaris pursue?

It is slowly but, as a rule, steadily progressive. Several years or
more may elapse before the area of disease is conspicuous.


What is the cause of lupus vulgaris?

It is now known to be due to the invasion of the cutaneous structures
by the tubercle bacillus; in short, a tuberculosis of the skin.
It is not infrequently observed in the strumous and debilitated. It
is entirely independent of syphilis.


What is the pathology of lupus vulgaris?

According to recent investigations, the infiltrations of lupus are
due chiefly to cell-proliferation and outgrowth from the protoplasmic
walls and adventitia of the bloodvessels and lymphatics. The
fibrous-tissue network, vessels and a portion of the cell infiltration
are thus produced, the fixed and wandering connective-tissue cells
of the inflamed stroma of the cutis being responsible for the other
portion of the new growth (Robinson).


State the diagnostic features of lupus vulgaris.

In a typical, developed patch of lupus are to be seen:       cicatricial
formation, usually of a fibrous and tough character; ulcerations; the
yellowish-brown tubercles and infiltration; and the characteristic
soft, small, yellowish or reddish-brown, cutaneous and subcutaneous
points and tubercles.


How does the tubercular syphiloderm differ from lupus vulgaris?

The tubercular syphiloderm is much more rapid in its course,
the ulceration is deeper and the discharge copious and often offensive;
the scarring is soft, and, compared to the amount of ulceration,
but slightly disfiguring; and it is, for obvious reasons, a disease of
adult or late life. The history, together with other evidences of
previous or concomitant symptoms of syphilis, will often aid in the
differentiation.


How does epithelioma differ from lupus vulgaris?

The edges of the epitheliomatous ulcer are hard, elevated and
waxy; the base is uneven, the secretion thin, scanty and apt to be
[Pg 206]
streaked with blood; the ulceration usually starts from one point,
and is often painful; the tissue destruction may be considerable;
there is little, if any, tendency to the formation of cicatricial tissue;
and, finally, it is usually a disease of advanced age.


In what respects does lupus erythematosus differ from lupus vulgaris?

Lupus erythematosus has no papules, tubercles or ulceration.


How does acne rosacea differ from lupus vulgaris?

Acne rosacea is characterized by hyper       mia, dilated vessels,
papules, pustules, the absence of ulceration, and a different history.


State the prognosis of lupus vulgaris.

Lupus vulgaris is always a chronic disease, often exceedingly
rebellious to treatment, and one that calls for a guarded opinion.
Relapses are not uncommon.


Fig. 46.




Galvano-cautery Needle, Knife and Spiral Points. (As devised by B        snier.)


The general health usually remains good, but in some instances
death by tuberculosis of the lungs has been noted.


Is external or internal treatment called for in lupus vulgaris?

Always external, and not infrequently constitutional also.


What is the constitutional treatment?

The general health must be cared for; good, nutritious food,
fresh air and out-door exercise, together with, in many cases, the
administration of such remedies as cod-liver oil, potassium iodide, iron
and quinine, are of therapeutic importance. Tuberculin may be tried
in severe and obstinate cases, but its use is not without danger.
[Pg 207]


State the object of local treatment.

The destruction or removal of the diseased tissue.


May milder methods of treatment sometimes prove beneficial
and even curative?

Exceptionally, mercurial plaster, corrosive-sublimate lotion and
ointment (gr. j to         j), a plaster containing five to fifteen per cent.
of salicylic acid and creasote, repeated paintings with carbolic acid,
and the constant application of lead plaster containing twenty per
cent. of ichthyol, are valuable.


Fig. 47.




Double Curette.


Of the milder methods, those most in vogue to-day are the Finsen
light and x-ray. Either proves extremely valuable in some cases,
but the Finsen method is the favorite method.


What methods are commonly employed for the rapid removal
or destruction of lupus tissue?

Cauterization, scarification, erasion and excision are variously practised;
the particular method depending, in great measure, upon the
extent of the disease, the part involved, and other circumstances.


Name the several caustics, and state how they are employed.

Pyrogallic acid, used as an ointment:       


          Ac. pyrogallici, .................................       ij
    Emplast. plumbi, .................................       j
    Cerat. resins       , ..................................       v.   M.


It is applied for one or two weeks. Every several days the parts
are poulticed, the slough thus removed, and the ointment reapplied,
and so on until the diseased tissue has been destroyed. It is useful
in those cases in which a mild and comparatively painless caustic
is advisable. In most cases several repetitions of this plan are
necessary.
[Pg 208]
Arsenious acid, employed as an ointment       


          Ac. arseniosi, ................................... gr. xx
    Hydrarg. sulphid. rub., .......................... gr. lx
    Ungt. aqu        ros       , .................................        i.   M.


It is painful but thorough; it is spread on lint and renewed daily.
The action is usually sufficient in three days, and the parts are then
poulticed until the slough comes away, after which a simple dressing
is employed. Its application is advisable for a small area only       not
more than four square inches       as absorption is possible.

Galvano-cautery.       The diseased tissue is destroyed by numerous
punctures with a red-heated point or by linear incision with a red-heated
knife. It is often a practicable and satisfactory method.
The Paquelin cautery and liquid air and carbon dioxide also have
their advocates.


Describe the operative measures employed in the removal of
lupus tissue.

Linear Scarification.       The parts are thoroughly cross-tracked,
cutting through the diseased tissue, and subsequently a simple salicylated
ointment applied. The operation is repeated from time to
time, and as a result the new growth undergoes retrogressive changes,
and cicatrization takes place.

Punctate Scarification.       By means of a simple or multiple-pointed
instrument numerous closely-set punctures are made, and repeated
from time to time, usually with the same action and result as from
linear scarification.

Erasion.       The parts are thoroughly scraped with a curette, and a
supplementary caustic application made, either with caustic potash
or several days' use of the pyrogallic-acid ointment. The result is
usually satisfactory.

The dental-burr is also useful in breaking up discrete tubercles.

Excision.       This is an effective method if the disease consists of a
small pea- or bean-sized circumscribed patch.

Of these various operative methods those now most favored are
erasion and excision, punctate and linear scarification methods are
now rarely employed.
[Pg 209]


Tuberculosis Cutis.[D]

(Synonym: Scrofuloderma.)

[D] The most important clinical variety of this class is lupus vulgaris,
which is considered above, separately, at some length.


What do you understand by tuberculosis cutis?

The term is applied to those peculiar suppurative and ulcerative
conditions of the skin due to the tubercle bacilli.


How does the common type of tuberculosis cutis begin?

The most common type of tuberculous ulceration or involvement
of the skin usually results by extension from an underlying caseating
and suppurating lymphatic gland; or it may have its origin as subcutaneous
tubercles independently of these structures. It tends to
spread, and may involve an area of one or several inches.


Fig. 48.





Tuberculosis Verrucosa Cutis (Negro).


[Pg 210]


What are the clinical appearances and behavior of this type
of tuberculous ulceration?

It is usually superficial, has thin, red, undermined edges of a
violaceous color, and an irregular base with granulations covered
scantily with pus. As a rule, it spreads gradually as a simple
ulceration, with but slight, if any, outlying infiltration. Subjective
symptoms of a painful or troublesome character are rarely present.
Its course is usually progressive but slow and chronic.

Other symptoms of tuberculosis are commonly to be found.


Are other forms of tuberculosis cutis met with?

A papulo-pustular eruption is sometimes observed, especially on
the upper extremities and face; sluggish and chronic in character
and leaving small pit-like scars; has been known as the small pustular
scrofuloderma.


Fig. 49.





Tuberculosis Verrucosa Cutis (patient had a coexistent pulmonary tuberculosis).


An ulcerative papillomatous or verrucous tuberculosis of the skin
(tuberculosis verrucosa cutis) is also occasionally noted, most commonly
seated upon the lower leg or the back of the hand. It may
be slight or extensive. Its mildest phase is the so-called verruca
necrogenica.
[Pg 211]


Describe verruca necrogenica.

Verruca necrogenica is a rare, localized, papillary or wart-like formation,
occurring usually about the knuckles or other parts of the hand.

It begins, as a rule, as a small, papule-like growth, increasing
gradually in area, and when well advanced appears as a pea, dime-sized
or larger, somewhat inflammatory, elevated, flat, warty mass,
with usually a tendency to slight pus-formation between the hypertrophied
papill       ; the surface may be horny or it may be crusted.
It tends to enlarge slowly and is usually persistent, but it at times
undergoes involution.


Fig. 50.




Tuberculosis Cutis (Verruca Necrogenica). (After Model in Guy's Museum.)


State the etiology.

Heredity, insufficient and unwholesome food, impure air, and the
like are predisposing. The tubercle bacillus is the immediate exciting
cause.

The disease usually appears in childhood or early adult life, and
not infrequently follows in the wake of some severe systemic disease.
Etiologically it is identical in nature with lupus.


How is the tuberculous ulcer to be differentiated from syphilis?

By the peculiar character of the tuberculous ulceration, the absence
of outlying tubercles and infiltration, together with its history,
course, and often the presence of other tuberculous symptoms.
[Pg 212]


State the prognosis.

These various types of tuberculosis cutis are, as a rule, more amenable
to treatment than that form known as lupus vulgaris (q. v.).


What is the treatment of these forms of tuberculosis cutis?

Constitutional remedies, such as cod-liver oil, iodide of iron or
other ferruginous tonics, together with good food and pure air;
phosphorus one-hundredth to one-fiftieth of a grain three times
daily is also of benefit in some cases.

The local treatment consists in thorough curetting and the subsequent
application of a mildly stimulating ointment. The several
other plans of external treatment employed in lupus (q. v.) are also
variously practised. In recent years the x-ray and Finsen light
plans have, in a measure, supplanted the previous methods of treatment.
They are slow, however, and might be, especially the x-ray,
more satisfactorily employed as a supplementary measure.


Ainhum.


Describe ainhum.

Ainhum is a disease of the African race, met with chiefly in
Brazil, the West Indies, and Africa, and consists of a slow but
gradual linear strangulation of one or more of the toes, especially
the smallest, resulting, eventually, in spontaneous amputation. The
affected toes themselves undergo fatty degeneration, often with
increase in size, and are, when strangulation is well advanced, considerably
misshapen. The nature of the disease is obscure.

Treatment consists, in the early stages, of incision through the
constricting band; when the disease is well advanced, amputation is
the sole recourse.


Mycetoma.

(Synonyms: Fungous Foot of India; Madura Foot; Podelcoma.)


Describe mycetoma.

It is a disease involving usually the foot, and is met with chiefly in
India. It is characterized by swelling and the formation of tubercular
or nodular lesions which break down and form the external
openings of sinuses which lead to the interior of the affected part.
These discharge, and are studded with, whitish granules or black,
roe-like masses, mixed with a sanious or sero-purulent fluid. The
[Pg 213]
whole part is gradually disintegrated, the process lasting indefinitely.
Its nature is obscure; it is thought to be due to a fungus.

Treatment consists in the early stages, when the disease is limited,
of thorough curetting and cauterization; later, after the part
is more or less involved, amputation, at a point well up beyond the
disease, becomes necessary. Potassium iodide internally may exert a
favorable influence.


Perforating Ulcer of the Foot.


Describe perforating ulcer of the foot.

Perforating ulcer of the foot is a rare disease, consisting of an
indolent and usually painless sinus leading down to diseased bone.
The external opening, which is through the centre of a corn-like
formation, is small, and may or may not show the presence of granulations.
The affected part is commonly more or less an       sthetic and
of subnormal temperature. One or several may be present, either
on one or both feet. The most common site is over the articulation
of the metatarsal bone with the phalanx of the first or last toe.
The disease is dependent upon impairment or degeneration of the
central, truncal or peripheral nerves.


What is to be said in regard to the prognosis and treatment?

Treatment, which is, as a rule, unsatisfactory, consists in the maintenance
of absolute rest, and the use of antiseptic and stimulating
applications. Amputation is also resorted to, but even this is
at times futile, as a new sinus may appear upon the stump.


Syphilis Cutanea.

(Synonyms: Syphiloderma; Dermatosyphilis; Syphilis of the Skin.)


In what various types may syphilis manifest itself upon the
integument?

Syphilis may show itself as a macular, papular (rarely vesicular),
pustular, bullous, tubercular and gummatous eruption; or the eruption
may be, in a measure, of a mixed type.
[Pg 214]


In what respects do the early (or secondary) eruptions of
syphilis differ from those following several years or
more after the contraction of the disease?

The early or secondary eruptions are more or less generalized, with
rarely any attempt at special configuration. Their appearance is
often preceded by symptoms of systemic disturbance, such as fever,
loss of appetite, muscular pains and headache; and accompanied by
concomitant signs of the disease, such as enlargement of the lymphatic
glands, sore throat, mucous patches, falling of the hair and
rheumatic pains.


State the distinguishing characters of the late eruptions.

The late eruptions (those following one or more years after the
contraction of the disease) are usually of tubercular, gummatous or
ulcerative type; are limited in extent, and have a marked tendency
to appear in circular, semicircular or crescentic forms or groups.
Pain in the bones, bone lesions and other symptoms may or may not
be present.


What is the color of syphilitic lesions?

Usually, a dull brownish-red or ham-red, with at times a yellowish
cast.


Are there any subjective symptoms in syphilitic eruptions?

As a rule, no; but in exceptional instances of the generalized
eruptions, more especially in negroes, there may be slight itching.


Describe the macular, or erythematous, eruption of syphilis.

The macular syphiloderm is a general eruption, showing itself
usually six or eight weeks after the appearance of the chancre. It
consists of small or large, commonly pea- or bean-sized, rounded or
irregularly-shaped, not infrequently slightly raised, macules. When
well established they do not entirely disappear under pressure. At
first a pale-pink or dull, violaceous red, they later become yellowish
or coppery. The eruption is generally profuse; the face, backs of the
hands and feet may escape. It persists several weeks or one or two
months; as a rule, it is rapidly responsive to treatment.


How would you distinguish the macular syphiloderm from
measles, r      theln and tinea versicolor?

Measles is to be differentiated by its catarrhal symptoms, fever,
form and situation of the eruption; r      theln, by its small, roundish,
[Pg 215]
confluent pinkish or reddish patches, its precursory pyrexic symptoms,
its epidemic nature, and short duration; tinea versicolor by
its scaliness, peripheral growth, distribution and history.

And, finally, by the absence or presence of other symptoms of
syphilis.


Fig. 51.






Macular Syphiloderm.


What several varieties of the papular eruption of syphilis are
met with?

There are two forms of the papular eruption       the small and large;
those of the latter type may undergo various modifications.


Describe the small-papular eruption of syphilis.

The small-papular syphiloderm (miliary papular syphiloderm)
usually shows itself in the third or fourth month of the disease, and
[Pg 216]
consists of a more or less generalized eruption of disseminated or
grouped, firm, rounded or acuminated pin-head to millet-seed-sized
papules, with smooth or slightly scaly summits, and in some lesions
showing pointed pustulation. Scattered minute pustules and some
large papules are usually present. The eruption is profuse, most abundant
upon the trunk and limbs; and in the early part of the outbreak
is of a bright- or dull-red color, later assuming a violaceous or
brownish tint. It runs a chronic course, is somewhat rebellious to
treatment, and displays a tendency to relapse.


Fig. 52.




Moist Papules. (After Miller.)


How would you distinguish the small-papular syphiloderm
from keratosis pilaris, psoriasis punctata, papular eczema,
and lichen ruber?

The distribution and extent of the eruption, the color, the grouping,
with usually the presence of pustules and large papules and
other concomitant symptoms of syphilis, are points of difference. Pustules
never occur in the several diseases named, except in eczema.


Describe the large-papular eruption of syphilis.

The large-papular syphiloderm (or lenticular syphiloderm) is a common form of cutaneous syphilis, appearing usually in the first
six or eight months, and consists of a more or less generalized eruption
of pea- to dime-sized or larger, flat, rounded or oval, firmly-seated,







Small-papular Syphiloderm.


[Pg 217]


more or less raised, dull-red papules; with at first a smooth
surface, which later usually becomes covered with a film of exfoliating
epidermis. The papules, as a rule, develop slowly, remain stationary
several weeks or a few months, and then pass away by
absorption, leaving slight pigmentation, which gradually fades; or
they may undergo certain modifications. In most cases it responds
rapidly to treatment.


Fig. 53.





Palmar Syphiloderm.


What modifications do the papules of the large-papular syphiloderm
sometimes undergo?

They may change into the moist papule and squamous papule.


Describe the moist papule of syphilis.

The change into the moist papule (also called mucous patch, flat
condyloma) is not uncommon where opposing surfaces and natural
folds of skin are subjected to more or less contact, as about the
anus, the scroto-femoral regions, umbilicus, axill        and beneath the
[Pg 218]
mamm       . The dry, flat papules gradually become moist and covered
with a grayish, sticky, mucoid secretion; several may coalesce
and form large, flat patches. They may so remain, or they may
become hypertrophic, warty or papillomatous, with more or less crust
formation (vegetating syphiloderm).


Fig. 54.




Annular Syphiloderm. (After I.E. Atkinson.)


Describe the squamous papule of syphilis.

This tendency of the large-papular eruption to become scaly, when
exhibited, is more or less common to all papules, and constitutes the
squamous or papulo-squamous syphiloderm (improperly called psoriasis
syphilitica). The papules become somewhat flattened and are
covered with dry, grayish or dirty-gray, somewhat adherent scales.
The scaling, as compared to that of psoriasis, is, as a rule, relatively
slight. The eruption may be general, as usually the case in the
earlier months of the disease, or it may appear as a relapse or a
later manifestation, and be limited in extent.

As a limited eruption it is most frequently seen on the palms and
soles       the palmar and plantar syphiloderm. Occurring on these
parts it is often rebellious to treatment.







Maculo-papular syphiloderm.


[Pg 219]


How are you to distinguish the papulo-squamous syphiloderm
from psoriasis?

In psoriasis the eruption is more inflammatory, and usually bright
red; the scales whitish or pearl-colored and, as a rule, abundant. It is
generally seen in greater profusion upon certain parts, as, for instance,
the extensor surfaces, especially of the elbows and knees. It is
not infrequently itchy, and, moreover, presents a different history.

In the syphilitic eruption some of the papules almost invariably
remain perfectly free from any tendency to scale formation; there is
distinct deposit or infiltration, and the lesions are of a dark, sluggish
red or ham tint; and, moreover, concomitant symptoms of syphilis
are usually present.


Describe the annular eruption of syphilis.

The annular syphiloderm (circinate syphiloderm) is observed usually
in association with the large-papular eruption, and consists of
several or more variously sized, ring-like lesions, with a distinctly
elevated solid ridge or wall peripherally and a more or less flattened
centre. It is commonly seen about the mouth, forehead and neck.
The lesion appears to have its origin from an ordinary, usually scaleless
or slightly scaly, large papule, the central portion of which has
been incompletely formed or has become sunken and flattened. The
manifestation is rare, and is seen most frequently in the negro.


What several varieties of the pustular syphiloderm are met
with?

The small acuminated-pustular syphiloderm, the large acuminated-pustular
syphiloderm, the small flat-pustular syphiloderm, and the
large flat-pustular syphiloderm.


Describe the small acuminated-pustular eruption of syphilis.

The small acuminated-pustular syphiloderm (miliary pustular
syphiloderm) is an early or late secondary eruption, commonly encountered
in the first six or eight months of the disease. It consists
of a more or less generalized, disseminated or grouped, millet-seed-sized,
acuminated pustules, usually seated upon dull-red,
papular elevations. The eruption is, as a rule, profuse, and usually
involves the hair-follicles. The pustules dry to crusts, which
fall off and are often followed by a slight, fringe-like exfoliation
[Pg 220]
around the base, constituting a grayish ring or collar. Minute pin-point
atrophic depressions or stains are left, which gradually become
less distinct. Scattered large pustules, and sometimes papules, are
not infrequently present.


Describe the large acuminated-pustular eruption of syphilis.

The large acuminated-pustular syphiloderm (acne-form syphiloderm,
variola-form syphiloderm) is a more or less generalized eruption,
occurring usually in the first six or eight months of the disease.
It consists of small or large pea-sized, disseminated or grouped,
acuminated or rounded pustules, resembling the lesions of acne and
variola. They develop slowly or rapidly, and at first may appear
more or less papular. They dry to somewhat thick crusts, and are
seated upon superficially ulcerated bases.

It pursues, as a rule, a comparatively rapid and benign course.
In relapses the eruption is usually more or less localized.


How would you distinguish the large acuminated-pustular
syphiloderm from acne and variola?

In acne the usual limitation of the lesions to the face or face and
shoulders, the origin, more rapid formation and evolution of the
individual lesions, and the chronic character of the disease, are
usually distinctive points.

In variola, the intensity of the general symptoms, the shot-like
beginning of the lesions, their course, the umbilication, and the
definite duration, are to be considered.

The presence or absence of other symptoms of syphilis has, in
obscure cases, an important diagnostic bearing.


Describe the small flat-pustular eruption of syphilis.

The small flat-pustular syphiloderm (impetigo-form syphiloderm)
consists of a more or less generalized, pea-sized, flat or raised, discrete,
irregularly-grouped, or in places confluent, pustules, appearing usually
in the first year of the disease. The pustules dry rapidly to yellow,
greenish-yellow, or brownish, more or less adherent, thick, uneven,
somewhat granular crusts, beneath which there may be superficial or
deep ulceration; where the lesions are confluent a continuous sheet
of crusting forms. The eruption is often scanty. It is most frequently
observed about the nose, mouth, hairy parts of the face and
[Pg 221]
scalp, and about the genitalia, frequently in association with papules
on other parts.


Are you likely to mistake the small flat-pustular syphiloderm
for any other eruption?

Scarcely; but when upon the scalp, it may bear rough resemblance
to pustular eczema, but the erosion or ulceration will serve to
differentiate. Moreover, concomitant symptoms of syphilis are to
be looked for.


Describe the large flat-pustular eruption of syphilis.

The large flat-pustular syphiloderm (ecthyma-form syphiloderm)
consists of a more or less generalized, scattered eruption, of large
pea- or dime-sized, flat pustules. They dry rapidly to crusts. The
bases of the lesions are a deep-red or copper color. Two types of
the eruption are met with.

In one type       the superficial variety       the crust is flat, rounded or
ovalish, of a yellowish-brown or dark-brown color, and seated upon
a superficial erosion or ulcer. The lesions are usually numerous,
and most abundant on the back, shoulders and extremities. It
appears, as a rule, within the first year, and generally runs a benign
course.


Fig. 55.




Rupia. (After Tilbury Fox.)

[Pg 222]
In the other type       the deep variety       the crust is greenish or
blackish, is raised and more bulky, often conical and stratified, like
an oyster shell       rupia; beneath the crusts may be seen rounded
or irregular-shaped ulcers, having a greenish-yellow, puriform secretion.
It is usually a late and malignant manifestation.


How would you differentiate the large flat-pustular syphiloderm
from ecthyma?

The syphilitic lesions are more numerous, are scattered, are
attended with superficial or deep ulceration, and followed by more
or less scar-formation. Moreover, the history, and presence or
absence of other symptoms of syphilis have an important diagnostic
value.


Fig. 56.






Ulcerating Tubercular Syphiloderm.


Describe the bullous eruption of syphilis.

The bullous syphiloderm, (of acquired syphilis) is a rare and
usually late eruption, appearing in the form of discrete, disseminated,
rounded or ovalish, pea- to walnut-sized, partially or fully distended,
blebs. The serous contents soon become cloudy and puriform. In
some cases the lesions are distinctly pustular from the beginning.
[Pg 223]
The crust, which soon forms, is of a yellowish-brown or dark green
color, and may be thick and stratified (rupia), as in the deep variety
of the large flat-pustular syphiloderm. The erosions or ulcers
beneath the crusts secrete a greenish-yellow fluid. It is a malignant
type of eruption, and is usually seen in broken-down subjects.

It is not an uncommon manifestation of hereditary syphilis (q. v.)
in the newborn.


Fig. 57.






Tubercular Syphiloderm.


How is the bullous syphiloderm to be differentiated from
other pemphigoid eruptions?

By the gravity of the disease, the accompanying ulceration, the
course and history; and by other evidences, past or present, of syphilis.


Describe the tubercular eruption of syphilis.

The tubercular syphiloderm (syphiloderma tuberculosum) may exceptionally
occur within the first year as a more or less generalized
eruption. As a rule, however, it is a late manifestation, at times
appearing many years after the initial lesion; is limited in extent,
and shows a decided tendency to occur in groups, often forming
[Pg 224]
segments of circles and circular areas, clearing in the centre and spreading
peripherally.

It consists (as a late, limited manifestation) of several or more
firm, circumscribed, deeply-seated, smooth, glistening or slightly
scaly elevations; rounded or acuminated in shape, of a yellowish-red,
brownish-red or coppery color and usually of the size of small or
large peas. Several groups may coalesce, and a serpiginous tract
result (serpiginous tubercular syphiloderm). The lesions develop
slowly, and are sluggish in their course, remaining, at times, for weeks
or months, with but little change. As a rule, however, they terminate
sooner or later, either by absorption, leaving a more or less
permanent pigment stain with or without slight atrophy (non-ulcerating
tubercular syphiloderm), or by ulceration (ulcerating tubercular
syphiloderm).


Describe the ulcerating tubercular syphiloderm.

Fig. 58.






Ulcerating Tubercular Syphiloderm.


The ulceration may be superficial or deep in character, and involve
several or all of the lesions forming the group. The patch may
consist, therefore, of small, discrete, punched-out ulcers, or of one
or more continuous ulcers, segmented, crescentic or serpiginous in
shape. They are covered with a gummy, grayish-yellow deposit or
they may be crusted. As the ulcerative changes take place, new







Tubercular Syphiloderm.







Large-pustular Syphiloderm.

[Pg 225]

lesions, especially about the periphery of the group or patch, may
appear from time to time.

In some instances, more especially about the scalp, the surface of
the ulcerations becomes papillary or wart-like, with an offensive, yellowish,
puriform secretion (syphilis cutanea papillomatosa).


From what diseases is the tubercular syphiloderm to be
differentiated?

From tubercular leprosy, epithelioma and lupus vulgaris, especially
the last-named.


What are the chief diagnostic characters of the tubercular
syphiloderm?

The tendency to form segments, crescents and circles, the color,
the pigmentation and ulceration, the history, and not infrequently
marks or scars of former eruptions.


Fig. 59.






Tubercular Syphiloderm.


Describe the gummatous eruption of syphilis.

The gummatous syphiloderm (syphiloderma gummatosum, gumma,
syphiloma) is usually a late manifestation, showing itself as one,
several or more painless or slightly painful, rounded or flat, more or
less circumscribed tumors; they are slightly raised, moderately firm,
and have their seat in the subcutaneous tissue. They tend to break
down and ulcerate.
[Pg 226]
The lesion begins usually as a pea-sized deposit or infiltration, and
grows slowly or rapidly; when fully developed it may be the size of
a walnut, or even larger. The overlying skin becomes gradually
reddish. At first firm, it is later soft and doughy. It may, even
when well advanced, disappear by absorption, but usually tends to
break down, terminating in a small or large, deep, punched-out ulcer.


Fig. 60.






Tubercular Syphiloderm.


Does the gummatous syphiloderm invariably appear as a
rounded well-defined tumor?

No. Exceptionally, instead of a well-defined tumor, it may appear
as a more or less diffused patch of infiltration, leading eventually
to extensive superficial or deep ulceration.


From what formations is the gummatous syphiloderm to be
differentiated?

From furuncle, abscess, and sebaceous, fatty and fibroid tumors.
[Pg 227]
Attention to the origin, course, and behavior of the lesion, together
with a history, must all be considered in doubtful cases.


Fig. 61.






Large Pustular Syphiloderm.


What is to be said in regard to the character and time of
appearance of the cutaneous manifestations of hereditary
syphilis?

In a great measure the cutaneous manifestations of hereditary
syphilis are essentially the same as observed in acquired syphilis.
They are usually noted to occur within the first three months of
extra-uterine life. The macular, papular, and bullous eruptions
are most common.


Describe these several cutaneous manifestations of hereditary
syphilis.

The macular (erythematous) eruption begins as large or small,
bright- or dark-red macules, later presenting a ham or caf        -au-lait
appearance. At first they disappear upon pressure. The lesions are
more or less numerous, usually become confluent, especially about
the folds of the neck, about the genitalia and buttocks; in these
regions resembling somewhat erythema intertrigo.

The papular eruption is observed in conjunction with the
[Pg 228]
erythematous manifestation, or it occurs alone. The lesions are but slightly
elevated, and seem to partake of the nature of both macules and
papules. They are usually discrete, and rarely abundant; they may
become decked with a film-like scale, and at the various points of
junction of skin and mucous membrane, and in the folds, they
become abraded and macerated, developing into moist papules.

The bullous eruption consists of variously-sized, more or less purulent
blebs, and is usually met with at or immediately following
birth. It is most abundant about the hands and feet. Macules and
papules are often interspersed. There may be superficial or deep
ulceration underlying the bull       .


What other symptoms in addition to the cutaneous manifestations
are noted in hereditary syphilis in the newborn?

Mucous patches, and sometimes ulcers, in the mouth and throat;
hoarseness, as shown by the peculiar cry, and indicating involvement
of the larynx; snuffles, a sallow and dirty appearance of the
skin, loss of flesh and often a shriveled or senile look.


What is the pathology of cutaneous syphilis?

The syphilitic deposit consists of round-cell infiltration. The
mucous layer, the corium, and in the deep lesions the subcutaneous
connective tissues also, are involved in the process. The infiltration
disappears by absorption or ulceration. The factor now believed to
be responsible for the disease and the pathological changes is the
Spiroch       ta pallida, discovered by Schaudinn and Hoffmann, and
usually found in numbers in the tissues.


Give the prognosis of cutaneous syphilis.

In acquired syphilis, favorable; sooner or later, unless the whole
system is so profoundly affected by the syphilitic poison that a fatal
ending ensues, the cutaneous manifestations disappear, either spontaneously
or as the result of treatment. The earlier eruptions will
often pass away without medication, but treatment is of material
aid in moderating their severity and hastening their disappearance,
and is to be looked upon as essential; in the late syphilodermata
treatment is indispensable. In the large pustular, the tubercular
and gummatous lesions, considerable destruction of tissue may take
place, and in consequence scarring result. Ill-health from any cause
predisposes to a relapse, and also adds to the gravity of the case.

In hereditary infantile syphilis, the prognosis is always uncertain:
[Pg 229]
the more distant from the time of birth the manifestations appear
the more favorable usually is the outcome.


How is cutaneous syphilis to be treated?

Always with constitutional remedies; and in the graver eruptions,
and especially in those more or less limited, with local applications
also.


What constitutional and local remedies are commonly employed
in cutaneous syphilis?

Constitutional Remedies.       Mercury and potassium iodide; tonics
and nutrients are necessary in some cases.

Local Remedies.       Mercurial ointments, lotions and baths, and
iodol in ointment or in (and also calomel) powder form.


Give the constitutional treatment of the earlier, or secondary,
eruptions of syphilis.

In secondary or early eruptions mercury alone in almost every
case; with tonics, if called for. If mercury is contraindicated
(extremely rare), potassium iodide may be substituted.


How is mercury usually administered in the eruptions of secondary
syphilis?

By the mouth, chiefly as the protiodide, calomel and blue mass,
in dosage just short of mild physiological action; by inunction, in
the form of blue ointment; by hypodermic injection, usually as
corrosive sublimate solution. The method by fumigation, with calomel
or bisulphuret, is now rarely employed.

The method by the mouth is the common one, and it is only in
rare instances that any other method is necessary or advisable.


What local applications are usually advised in the eruptions
of secondary syphilis?

If the eruption is extensive, and more especially in the pustular
types, baths of corrosive sublimate (      ii-      iv] to Cong. xxx) may be
used; and ointment of ammoniated mercury, twenty to sixty grains
to the ounce, blue ointment, and the ten per cent. oleate of mercury
alone or with an equal quantity of any ointment base.

The same applications or a dusting powder of calomel may also be
used on moist papules.
[Pg 230]


How long is mercury to be actively continued in cases of
early (secondary) syphilis?

Until one or two months after all manifestations (cutaneous or
other) have disappeared, and then, as a general rule, continued, as
a small daily dose (about one-quarter to one-third of that prescribed
during the active treatment) for a period of two or three months;
then another cycle of the active dosage for a period of four to six
weeks; then a resumption of the smaller daily dose for another two
or three months; and so on, for a period of at least two years.

(Almost all authorities are agreed as to the importance of prolonged
treatment, but differ somewhat on the question of intermittent
or uninterrupted administration.)


Give the constitutional treatment of the late, or localized,
syphilodermata.

Mercury always, usually in small or moderate dosage, as the biniodide
or corrosive chloride, and potassium iodide; the latter in dose
varying from two grains to two drachms or more, t.d., depending
upon its action and the urgency of the case.


How long is constitutional treatment to be continued in cases
of the late syphilodermata?

Actively for several weeks after the disappearance of all symptoms,
and then (especially the mercury) continued in smaller dosage (about
one-third) for several months longer.


What applications are usually advised in the late, or localized,
syphilodermata?

Ointment of ammoniated mercury, twenty to sixty grains to the
ounce; oleate of mercury, five to ten per cent. strength; mercurial
plaster, full strength or weakened with lard or petrolatum; a two to
twenty per cent. ointment of iodol; resorcin, twenty to sixty grains
to the ounce of ointment base; and lotions of corrosive sublimate,
one-half to three grains to the ounce.

The following is valuable in offensive and obstinate ulcerations:       


          Hydrarg. chlorid. corros., ....................... gr. iv-gr. viij
    Ac. carbolici, ................................... gr. x-xx
    Alcoholis, ...................................... f      iv
    Glycerin       , ...................................... f      j
    Aqu       , ................ q.s. ad. ..................        iv.   M.

[Pg 231]
Ointments are to be rubbed in or applied as a plaster; lotions, employed
chiefly in ulcers and ulcerations, are to be thoroughly dabbed
on, and usually supplemented by the application of an ointment.
Iodol may also be applied to ulcers as a dusting-powder, usually
mixed with one to several parts of zinc oxide or boric acid.


Give the treatment of hereditary infantile syphilis.

It is essentially the same (but much smaller dosage) as employed
in acquired syphilis. Attention to proper feeding and hygiene is of
first importance.

Mercury may be given by the mouth, as mercury with chalk
(gr. ss-gr. ij, t.d.); as calomel (gr. 1/20-gr. 1/6, t.d.); and as a solution
of corrosive sublimate (gr. ss-       vj,       j, t.d.). If mercury is not well
borne by the stomach, it may be administered by inunction; for this
purpose, blue ointment is mixed with one or two parts of lard and
spread (about a drachm) upon an abdominal bandage and applied,
being renewed daily. Treatment by means of baths (gr. x-xxx to
the bath) of corrosive sublimate is, at times, a serviceable method.

Potassium iodide, if exceptionally deemed preferable, may be given
in the dose of a fractional part of a grain to two or three grains three
times daily.


What local measures are to be advised in cutaneous syphilis
of the newborn?

If demanded, applications similar to those employed in eruptions
of acquired syphilis, but not more than one-third to one-half the
strength.


Lepra.

(Synonyms: Leprosy; Elephantiasis Gr       corum.)


What do you understand by leprosy?

Lepra, or leprosy, is an endemic, chronic, malignant constitutional
disease, characterized by alterations in the cutaneous, nerve, and
bone structures; varying in its morbid manifestations according to
whether the skin, nerves or other tissues are predominantly involved.


What is the nature of the premonitory symptoms of leprosy?

In some instances the active manifestations appear without
[Pg 232]
premonition, but in the majority of cases symptoms, slight or severe
in character, pointing toward profound constitutional disturbance,
such as mental depression, malaise, chills, febrile attacks, digestive
derangements and bone pains, are noticed for weeks, months, or
several years preceding the outbreak.


What several varieties of leprosy are observed?

Two definite forms are usually described       the tubercular and the
an       sthetic. A sharp division-line cannot, however, always be
drawn; not infrequently the manifestations are of a mixed type,
or one form may pass into or gradually present symptoms of the
other.


Fig. 62.




Tubercular Leprosy. (After Stoddard.)


Describe the symptoms of tubercular leprosy.

The formation of tubercles and tubercular masses of infiltration,
usually of a yellowish-brown color, with subsequent ulceration,
constitute the important cutaneous symptoms. Along with, or preceding
these characteristic lesions, blebs and more or less infiltrated,
hyper       sthetic or an       sthetic, pinkish, reddish or pale-yellowish
[Pg 233]
macules make their appearance from time to time; subsequently
fading away or remaining permanently (lepra maculosa).

When well advanced, the tubercular or nodular masses give rise
to great deformity; the face, a favorite locality, becomes more or
less leonine in appearance (leontiasis). The tubercles persist almost
indefinitely without material change, or undergo absorption or ulceration;
this last takes place most commonly about the fingers and
toes. The mucous membrane of the mouth, pharynx and other
parts may also become involved.

An       sthetic Leprosy.


Describe the symptoms of an       sthetic leprosy.

Following or along with precursory symptoms denoting general
systemic disturbance, or independently of any prodromal indications,
a hyper       sthetic condition, in localized areas or more or less general,
is observed. Lancinating pains along the nerves and an irregular
[Pg 234]
pemphigoid eruption are also commonly noted. There soon follows
the special eruption, coming out from time to time, and consisting
of several or more, usually non-elevated, well-defined, pale-yellowish
patches, one or two inches in diameter. As a rule, they are at first
neither hyper       sthetic nor an       sthetic, but may be the seat of slight
burning or itching. They spread peripherally, and tend to clear in
the centre. The patches eventually become markedly an       sthetic,
and the overlying skin, and the skin on other parts as well, becomes
atrophic and of a brownish or yellowish color. The subcutaneous
tissues, muscle, hair and nails undergo atrophic or degenerative
changes, and these changes are especially noted about the hands and
feet. These parts become crooked, the bone tissues are involved,
the phalanges dropping off or disappearing by disintegration or
absorption (lepra mutilans). Sooner or later various paralytic
symptoms, showing more active involvement of the nerve trunks,
present themselves.


State the cause of leprosy.

Present knowledge points to a peculiar bacillus as the active
factor, while climate, soil, heredity, food and habits exert a predisposing
influence.


Is leprosy contagious?

The consensus of opinion points to the acceptance of the possible
contagiousness of leprosy; probably by inoculation, but only under
certain unknown favoring conditions.


What are the pathological changes?

The lesions consist essentially of a new growth, made up of
numerous small, more or less aggregated round cells, beginning in
the walls of the bloodvessels. In this way the tubercular masses
and various other lesions are formed. As yet, positive involvement
ot the central nervous system has not been shown, but some of the
nerve trunks are found to be inflamed and swollen, with a tendency
toward hardening.


What several diseases are to be eliminated in the diagnosis
of leprosy?

Syphilis, morph       a, vitiligo, lupus, and syringomyelia.

When well advanced, the aggregate symptoms of leprosy form a
[Pg 235]
picture which can scarcely be confused with that of any other disease.
In doubtful cases microscopical examinations of the involved
tissues, for the bacilli, should be made.


State the prognosis of leprosy.

Unfavorable; a fatal termination is the rule, but may not be
reached for a number of years. The tubercular form is the most
grave, the mixed variety next, and the an       sthetic the least. Patients
are not infrequently carried off by intercurrent disease. Proper
management will often delay the fatal ending, and exceptionally, in
the an       sthetic variety, stay the progress of the disease.


What is the treatment of leprosy?

Hygienic measures are important. Chaulmoogra oil and gurjun
oil internally and externally are in some instances of service.
Strychnia alone, or with either of these oils, is ofttimes beneficial.
Ichthyol internally, and external applications of the same drug, and
of resorcin, chrysarobin, and pyrogallic acid, have been extolled.
Change of climate, especially to a region where the disease does not
prevail, is often of great advantage.


Pellagra.

(Synonym: Lombardian Leprosy.)


Describe pellagra.

Pellagra is a slow but usually progressive disease occurring chiefly
in Italy, due, it is thought, to the continued ingestion of decomposed
or fermented maize. It is characterized by cutaneous symptoms,
at first upon exposed parts, of an erythematous, desquamative,
vesicular and bullous character, and by general constitutional disturbance
of a markedly neurotic type. A fatal ending, if the disease
is at all severe or advanced, is to be expected.

Treatment is based upon general principles.
[Pg 236]


Epithelioma.

(Synonyms: Skin Cancer; Epithelial Cancer; Carcinoma Epitheliale.)


What several varieties of epithelioma are met with?

Three       the superficial, the deep-seated, and the papillomatous.


Describe the clinical appearances and course of the superficial
variety of epithelioma.

The superficial, or flat variety (rodent ulcer), begins, usually on
the face, as a minute, firm, reddish or yellowish tubercle, as an


Fig. 64.



Epithelioma. (After D. Lewis.)


aggregation of such, as a warty excrescence, or as a localized degenerative
seborrh       ic patch. The latter lesion (known also as keratosis
senilis, old-age atrophic patches), consisting of a yellowish or
yellowish-brown greasy or hardened scurfy spot or patch is quite
frequently the starting-point of epithelial growths. Sooner or
later, commonly after months or several years, the surface becomes
slightly excoriated, and an insignificant, yellowish or brownish crust
is formed. The excoriation gradually develops into superficial
[Pg 237]
ulceration, and the diseased area becomes slowly larger and larger. New
lesions may continue, from time to time, to appear about the edges
and go through the same changes.

The ulcer has usually an uneven surface, secretes a thin, scanty,
viscid fluid, which dries to a firm, adherent crust. It is usually
defined against the healthy skin by a slightly elevated, hard, roll-like,
waxy-looking border. In rare instances there is a disposition, at
points, to spontaneous involution and scar formation; as a rule,
however, the ulcerative action slowly progresses.

The general health is unimpaired, the neighboring lymphatic
glands are not involved, and the local condition, beyond the disfigurement,
gives rise to little trouble, unless, as occasionally happens,
it passes into the more malignant, deep-seated variety.


Describe the clinical appearances and course of the deep-seated
variety of epithelioma.

The deep-seated variety starts from the superficial form, or it begins
as a tubercle or nodule in the skin. When typically developed,
a reddish, shining tubercle or nodule, or area of infiltration, forms
in the skin or subcutaneous tissue. In the course of weeks or
months superficial or deep-seated ulceration takes place; the ulcer
having hardened, and, as a rule, everted edges. The surface is reddish
and granular, and secretes an ichorous discharge. The infiltration
spreads, the ulcer enlarges both peripherally and in depth       
muscle, cartilage and bone often becoming invaded. The neighboring
lymphatic gland may become implicated, pains of a burning or
neuralgic type are experienced, and from septic       mia, marasmus, or
involvement of vital parts, death eventually ensues.


Describe the clinical appearances and course of the papillomatous
variety of epithelioma.

The papillomatous type usually arises from the superficial or
deep-seated variety, or it may begin as a papillary or warty growth.
When fully developed, it presents an ulcerated, fissured and papillomatous
surface, with an ichorous discharge which dries to crusts.
It is slowly progressive, and sooner or later may develop a malignant
tendency.


Upon what parts is epithelioma commonly observed?

About the face, especially the nose, eyelids and lips; and also
about the genitalia. It may involve any part.
[Pg 238]


At what age is epithelioma usually noted?

It is essentially a disease of middle and late life, although it is
exceptionally met with in the young.


What is the cause of epithelioma?

The etiology is obscure. It is not, as a rule, inherited. Any
locally irritated tissue may be the starting point of the disease.


State the pathology.

The process consists in the proliferation of epithelial cells from
the mucous layer; the cell-growth takes place downward, in the
form of finger-like prolongations or columns, or it may spread
out laterally, so as to form rounded masses, the centres of which
usually undergo horny transformation, resulting in the formation
of onion-like bodies, the so-called cell-nests or globes. The rapid
cell-growth requires increased nutriment, and hence the bloodvessels
become enlarged; moreover, the pressure of the cell-masses gives
rise to irritation and inflammation, with corresponding serous and
round-cell infiltration.


How would you distinguish epithelioma from syphilitic
ulceration, wart, and lupus vulgaris?

From syphilis it is to be differentiated by the history, duration,
character of the base and edges, its comparative slow progress, its
usually slight, viscid discharge, often streaked with blood, and, if
necessary, by the therapeutic test.

Wart or warty growths are to be differentiated by attention to their
history and course. Long-continued observation may be necessary
before a positive opinion is warrantable. The appearance of any
tendency to crusting, to break down or ulcerate is significant of epitheliomatous
degeneration.

In lupus vulgaris the deposits are peculiar and multiple, the
ulcerations are of different character, the tendency to scar-formation
constant; and, with few exceptions, it has, moreover, its beginning
in childhood or early adult life.


What factors are to be considered in giving a prognosis in
epithelioma?

The variety, extent, and rapidity of the process. The superficial
form may exist for years, and give rise to no alarm; whereas the
[Pg 239]
deeper-seated varieties are always to be viewed as serious, and are,
indeed, often fatal. Involving the genitalia, its course is often
strikingly rapid. Relapses, after removal, are not uncommon.


What is the special object in view in the treatment of epithelioma?

Thorough destruction or removal of the epitheliomatous tissue.


How is the destruction or removal of the epitheliomatous
tissue effected?

By the use of such caustics as caustic potash, chloride-of-zinc
paste, pyrogallic acid, arsenic, and the galvano-cautery; and by
operative measures, such as excision and erasion with the dermal
curette, and by the x-ray. (See treatment of lupus vulgaris.)

In small lesions the use of an arsenical paste is a most admirable
method of treatment, although somewhat painful. The paste is made
of one part powdered acacia and one to two parts arsenious acid;
at the time of application sufficient water is added to make a paste.
This is applied thickly, and a piece of lint superimposed. A good
deal of pain and inflammatory swelling ensue; at the end of twenty-four
hours the part is poulticed till the slough comes away; the
ulcer is then treated as a simple ulcer, under which healing takes
place. Occasionally a second application is found necessary.

Upon the whole, the best method in the average case is to curette
thoroughly, and supplement with momentary cauterization, with
caustic potash, or with several days' use of the pyrogallic acid ointment.
During the healing process, short exposures to the R      ntgen
ray       about every three to five days       is good practice.

The degenerative changes in the beginning of scurfy, seborrh       ic
spots or patches seen in old people can frequently be lessened or
wholly stopped by the daily application of an ointment containing
5 to 10 per cent. of sulphur and 2 to 5 per cent. of salicylic acid.


What can be said of the value of the x-ray in epithelioma?

The x-ray method is now much in vogue, and proves curative in
many superficial cases, and of benefit in some of the deeper-seated
varieties. In most cases it must be pushed to the point of producing
a mild x-ray erythema; and in some instances benefit or cure only
[Pg 240]
occurs after more active exposure, sufficient to cause an x-ray burn
of the second degree. The method is not attended with much risk
if properly used. The healthy parts should be protected by lead-foil.
Exposure should be two to five times weekly, at a distance of
three to eight inches, and from five to twenty minutes, employing a
tube of medium vacuum. Unfortunately the method is usually slow.
The radium treatment is essentially similar to that by the x-ray.

The much better plan, as already intimated, is to employ one of
the several operative or caustic methods, and supplementing, while
healing, with the x-ray.


Paget's Disease of the Nipple.

(Synonyms: Malignant Papillary Dermatitis; Paget's Disease.)


What do you understand by Paget's disease of the nipple?

Paget's disease is a rare, inflammatory-looking, malignant disease
of the nipple and areola in women, usually of advancing years, eventually
terminating in cancerous involvement of the entire gland.


Describe the symptoms of Paget's disease.

The first symptoms, which usually last for months or years, are
apparently eczematous, accompanied with more or less burning,
itching and tingling. Gradually, the diseased area, which is sharply-defined,
and feels like a thin layer of indurated tissue, presents a
florid, intensely red, very finely-granular, raw surface, attended with
a more or less copious viscid exudation. Sooner or later retraction
and destruction of the nipple, followed by gradual scirrhous involvement
of the whole breast, takes place.


What is the pathology of Paget's disease?

Although it was thought at one time to be a cancerous disease
resulting from a continued eczematous inflammation of the parts,
there is now but little doubt that it is of malignant nature from the
earliest stages. The psorosperm-like bodies found, to the presence
of which the disease has by some authorities been attributed
(psorospermosis), are now known to be merely changed and
[Pg 241]
degenerated epithelia. The morbid changes consist of an inflammation
of the papillary region of the derma, leading to        dema and
vacuolation of the constituent cells of the epidermis, followed by
their complete destruction in places and their abnormal proliferation
in others (Fordyce).


State the diagnostic features of Paget's disease.

The age of the patient; the sharp limitation; the well-defined,
indurated film of infiltration; the peculiar, red, raw, granulating
appearance; and, later, the retraction of the nipple; and, finally,
the involvement of the deeper parts.


What is the prognosis?

If the disease is recognized early, and properly treated, a cure may
be anticipated; later the outlook is that of scirrhus of the breast.


What is the treatment of Paget's disease?

Thorough cauterization by means of caustic potash or the galvano-cautery;
or, its extirpation by means of the curette or excision.
After extirpation or cauterization, supplementary treatment by the
x-ray is advisable as an additional measure of precaution against
relapse.

Until the diagnosis is thoroughly established, soothing applications,
such as are employed in acute eczema, are to be advised.


Sarcoma.

(Synonyms: Sarcoma Cutis; Sarcoma of the Skin.)


Describe the several varieties of sarcoma.

Sarcoma of the skin is a more or less malignant new growth, of
rapid or slow progress, characterized by the appearance of single
or multiple, variously-shaped, discrete, non-pigmented or pigmented
tubercles or tumors, of size varying from that of a shot to a hazelnut
or larger. As a rule the growths are smooth, firm and elastic,
somewhat painful upon pressure, and exhibit a tendency to ulcerate.
The overlying skin is at first normal and somewhat movable, but as
the growths approach the surface it becomes reddened and adherent;
[Pg 242]
or, if the disease is of the pigmented variety, it acquires a bluish-black
color. It is now generally believed that the most of the pigmented
cases formerly thought to be of sarcomatous nature are
really carcinomatous in character.

The multiple pigmented sarcoma (melano-sarcoma) appears first,
usually on the soles and dorsal surfaces of the feet, and later on the
hands. There is more or less diffuse thickening of the integument.
The lesions themselves manifest a disposition to bleed.


State the prognosis and treatment of sarcoma.

The disease is always more or less malignant and, as a rule,
sooner or later a fatal termination takes place. It is usually slow
in its course.

Excision or extirpation, x-ray exposures, and the administration
of arsenic in increasing dosage (preferably by hypodermic injection)
now are generally considered the most promising in this usually
hopeless malady.


Granuloma Fungoides.


Describe granuloma fungoides.

A rare form of disease, heretofore looked upon as sarcomatous,
but now generally recognized as granuloma, and formerly described
under the names mycosis fungoides, inflammatory fungoid neoplasm,
and several others. It is characterized usually by symptoms of an
eczematous, urticarial, and erysipelatous nature, and by the sudden
or gradual appearance of pinkish or reddish, tubercular, nodular,
lobulated, or furrowed tumors or flat infiltrations, which may disappear
by involution or may be followed by ulceration; several or
a larger number of the growths present a mushroom, papillomatous,
or fungoid appearance, sometimes roughly resembling the cut part
of a tomato. In most cases the tumor stage of the malady is not
reached for two or more years; in exceptional instances, however,
they appear in the first few months. The lesions, especially in their
early stages, are, as a rule, accompanied with more or less burning
and itching.
[Pg 243]


State the prognosis and treatment of granuloma fungoides.

The malady may last for several years or much longer, a fatal termination,
with rare exceptions, sooner or later taking place. After
the tumor stage is well established, the patient usually succumbs in
from several months to one or two years.


Fig. 65.






Granuloma Fungoides.


Treatment consists of tonics, if indicated, and the administration
of arsenic, preferably hypodermically, and R      ntgen-ray exposures,
along with the application of mild antiseptics, and operative interference
when necessary or advisable.
[Pg 244]


CLASS VII.       NEUROSES.


Hyper       sthesia.


What is hyper       sthesia?

By hyper       sthesia is meant increased cutaneous sensibility. It is
usually more or less localized, and is met with as a symptom in functional
and organic nervous diseases.


Dermatalgia.

(Synonyms: Neuralgia of the Skin; Rheumatism of the Skin; Dermalgia.)


What do you understand by dermatalgia?

By dermatalgia is meant a tender or painful condition of the skin
unattended by structural change. It is commonly limited to a small
area, and is usually symptomatic of functional or organic nervous
disease. As an idiopathic affection it is looked upon as of a rheumatic
origin.

Treatment depends upon the cause.


An       sthesia.


What is an       sthesia?

An       sthesia is a diminution, comparative or complete, of cutaneous
sensibility. It is usually localized, and is met with in the course
of certain nervous affections. It is also encountered in leprosy,
morph       a and like diseases.


Pruritus.


What do you understand by pruritus?

Pruritus is a functional disease of the skin, the sole symptom of
which is itching, there being no structural change.
[Pg 245]


Describe the symptoms of pruritus.

The sole and essential symptom is itchiness, usually more or less
paroxysmal, and worse at night. There are no primary structural
lesions, but in severe and persistent cases the parts become so irritated
by continued scratching that secondary lesions, such as papules
and slight thickening and infiltration, may result. It is much more
common in advanced life       pruritus senilis. In such cases, as well as
in those cases in younger and middle-aged individuals in which the
itchiness develops at the approach of cold weather and disappears
upon the coming of the warm season (pruritus hiemalis), the pruritus
is usually more or less generalized, although not infrequently
in the latter the legs are specially involved.

In some individuals an attack of pruritus, of variable intensity,
lasting from five to thirty minutes, comes on immediately after a
bath (bath-pruritus). It is usually confined to the legs from the
hips down.


Is pruritus always more or less generalized?

No; not infrequently the itching is limited to the genital region
(pruritus scroti, pruritus vulv       ) or to the anus (pruritus ani).


To what may pruritus often be ascribed?

To digestive and intestinal derangements, hepatic disorders, the
uric acid diathesis, gestation, diabetes mellitus, and a depraved state
of the nervous system.

Pruritus vulv        is at times due to irritating discharges, and pruritus
ani occasionally to hemorrhoids and seat-worms.


Is there any difficulty in the diagnosis of pruritus?

No. The subjective symptom of itching without the presence
of structural lesions is diagnostic. In those severe and persistent
cases in which excoriations and papules have resulted from the
scratching, the history of the case, together with its course, must
be considered. Care should be taken not to confound it with pediculosis.
In this latter the excoriations usually have a somewhat peculiar
distribution, being most abundant on those parts of the body
with which the clothing lies closely in contact. (See Pediculosis
corporis.)
[Pg 246]
In pruritus of the genitocrural region the possibility of pediculi
being the cause must be kept in mind; an examination of the parts
for the parasite or for ova (attached to the hairs) would prevent
error. (See Pediculosis pubis.)


What prognosis would you give in pruritus?

In the majority of cases the condition responds to proper treatment,
but in others it proves rebellious. The prognosis depends, in
fact, upon the removability of the cause. Temporary relief may
always be given by external applications.


How would you treat pruritus?

With systemic remedies directed toward a removal or modification
of the etiological factors, and, for the temporary relief of the itching,
suitable antipruritic applications. In obscure cases, quinia,
salophen, lithia salts, calcium chloride, belladonna, nux vomica,
arsenic, pilocarpine, and general galvanization may be variously
tried. Alkalies prove useful in many cases.

Exceptionally, the relief furnished by external treatment is more
or less permanent.


Name the important antipruritic applications.

Alkaline baths; lotions of carbolic acid (      j-      iij to Oj), of resorcin
(      j-      iv to Oj), of liquor carbonis detergens (       j-       iv to Oj), and
liquor picis alkalinus (      j-      iv to Oj), used cautiously. One or several
ounces of alcohol and one or two drachms of glycerin in each
pint of these lotions will often be of advantage, as the following:       


          Ac. carbolici, ...................................       j-      iij
    Gylcerin       , ...................................... f      ij
    Alcoholis, ...................................... f       ij
    Aqu       , .................. q.s. ad. ................ Oj.   M.


Various dusting-powders, alone or in conjunction with the lotions.

And in some cases, especially those in which the skin is unnaturally
dry, ointments may be used, such as equal parts of lard, lanolin, and
petrolatum, to the ounce of which may be added from five to thirty
grains of carbolic acid, three to twenty grains of thymol, ten to thirty
minims of chloroform, or two to ten grains of menthol.
[Pg 247]

What external applications are to be used in the local varieties
of pruritus?

In pruritus ani and pruritus vulv       , in addition to the various
applications above, a cocaine ointment, one to ten grains to the ounce,
a strong solution of the same (gr. v-xx to        j), and an ointment
containing ten to thirty minims of the oil of peppermint to the
ounce; sponging with hot water, often affords temporary relief.

In pruritus vulv       , moreover, astringent applications and injections
of zinc sulphate, alum, tannic or acetic acid, in the strength commonly
employed for vaginal injections, are at times curative.

In bath-pruritus weak glycerine lotions, and an ointment containing
a few grains of thymol and menthol to the ounce sometimes
give moderate relief. Turkish baths are sometimes free from subsequent
pruritus.



CLASS VIII.       PARASITIC AFFECTIONS.


Tinea Favosa.

(Synonym: Favus.)


What is tinea favosa?

Tinea favosa, or favus, is a contagious vegetable-parasitic disease
of the skin, characterized by pin-head to pea-sized, friable, umbilicated,
cup-shaped yellow crusts, each usually perforated by a hair.


Upon what parts and at what age is favus observed?

It is usually met with upon the scalp, but it may occur upon any
part of the integument. Occasionally the nails are invaded.
It is seen at all ages, but is much more common in children.


Describe the symptoms of favus of the scalp.

The disease begins as a superficial inflammation or hyper       mic
spot, more or less circumscribed, slightly scaly, and which is soon followed
by the formation of yellowish points about the hair follicles,
surrounding the hair shaft. These yellowish points or crusts increase
in size, become usually as large as small peas, are cup-shaped, with
the convex side pressing down upon the papillary layer, and the
[Pg 248]
concave side raised several lines above the level of the skin; they are
umbilicated, friable, sulphur-colored, and usually each cup or disc is
perforated by a hair. Upon removal or detachment, the underlying
surface is found to be somewhat excavated, reddened, atrophied and
sometimes suppurating. As the disease progresses the crusting becomes
more or less confluent, forming irregular masses of thick,
yellowish, mortar-like crusts or accumulations, having a peculiar,
characteristic odor       that of mice, or stale, damp straw. The hairs
are involved early in the disease, become brittle, lustreless, break off
and fall out. In some instances, especially near the border of the
crusts, are seen pustules or suppurating points. Atrophy and more
or less actual scarring are sooner or later noted.

Itching, variable as to degree, is usually present.


What is the course of favus of the scalp?

Persistent and slowly progressive.


Fig. 66.




Achorion Sch      nleinii X 450. (After Duhring.)
Showing simple mycelium, in various stages of development, and free spores.


What are the symptoms of favus when seated upon the general
surface?

The symptoms are essentially similar to those upon the scalp,
modified somewhat by the anatomical differences of the parts.
[Pg 249]
The nails, when affected, become yellowish, more or less thickened,
brittle and opaque (tinea favosa unguium, onychomycosis
favosa).


To what is favus due?

Solely to the invasion of the cutaneous structures, especially the
epidermal portion, by the vegetable parasite, the achorion Sch      nleinii.
It is contagious. It is a somewhat rare disease in the native-born,
being chiefly observed among the foreign poor. The nails are rarely
affected primarily.

It is also met with in the lower animals, from which it is doubtless
not infrequently communicated to man.


What are the diagnostic features of favus?

The yellow, and often cup-shaped, crusts, brittleness and loss of
hair, atrophy, and the history.


Fig. 67.




Epilating Forceps.


How would you distinguish favus from eczema and ringworm?

From eczema by the condition of the affected hair, the atrophic
and scar-like areas, the odor, and the history. From ringworm by
the crusting and the atrophy. In this latter disease there is usually
but slight scaliness, and rarely any scarring.

Finally, if necessary, a microscopic examination of the crusts may
be made.


State the method of examination for fungus.

A portion of the crust is moistened with liquor potass        and examined
with a power of three to five hundred diameters. The fungus,
(achorion Sch      nleinii), consisting of mycelium and spores, is luxuriant
and is readily detected.


State the prognosis of favus..

Upon the scalp, favus is extremely chronic and rebellious to treatment,
[Pg 250]
and a cure in six to twelve months may be considered satisfactory;
in neglected cases permanent baldness, atrophy, and scarring
sooner or later result. Although favus of the scalp persists into
adult life, it becomes less active and, finally, as a rule, gradually disappears,
leaving behind scarred or atrophic bald areas.

Upon the general surface it usually responds readily to treatment,
excepting favus of the nails, which is always obstinate.


How is favus of the scalp treated?

Treatment is entirely local and consists in keeping the parts free
from crusts, in epilation and applications of a parasiticide.

The crusts are removed by oily applications and soap-and-water
washings. The hair on and around the diseased parts is to be kept
closely cut, and, when practicable, depilation, or extraction of the
affected hairs, is advised; this latter is, in most cases, essential
to a cure. Remedial applications       the so-called parasiticides       are,
as a rule, to be made twice daily. If an ointment is
used, it is to be thoroughly rubbed in; if a lotion, it is to be dabbed
on for several minutes and allowed to soak in.


Name the most important parasiticides.

Corrosive sublimate, one to four grains to an ounce of alcohol and
water; carbolic acid, one part to three or more parts of glycerine;
a ten per cent. oleate of mercury; ointments of ammoniated mercury,
sulphur and tar; and sulphurous acid, pure or diluted. The
following is valuable:       


          Sulphur, pr       cip., ................................       ij
    Saponis viridis,
    Ol. cadini, ....................            ................       j
    Adipis, ..........................................        ss.   M.


Chrysarobin is a valuable remedy, but must be used with caution;
it may be employed as an ointment, five to ten per cent. strength,
as a rubber plaster, or as a paint, a drachm to an ounce of gutta-percha
solution. Formalin, weakened or full strength, has been
extolled. Some observers have experimentally tried the effect of
x-ray exposure with alleged good results, pushing the treatment to
the point of producing depilation; if used great caution should be
exercised.
[Pg 251]

How is favus upon the general surface to be treated?

In the same general manner as favus of the scalp, but the
remedies employed should be somewhat weaker. In favus of the
nail frequent and close paring of the affected part and the application,
twice daily, of one of the milder parasiticides, will eventually
lead to a good result.


Is constitutional treatment of any value in favus?

It is questionable, but in debilitated subjects tonics, especially cod-liver
oil, may be prescribed with the hope of aiding the external
applications.


Tinea Trichophytina.

(Synonym: Ringworm.)


What is tinea trichophytina?

Tinea trichophytina, or ringworm, is a contagious, vegetable-parasitic
disease due to the invasion of the cutaneous structures by the
vegetable parasite, the trichophyton, or the microsporon Audouinii.


Do the clinical characters of ringworm vary according to the
part affected?

Yes, often considerably; thus upon the scalp, upon the general
surface, and upon the bearded region, the disease usually presents
totally different appearances.


Describe the symptoms of ringworm as it occurs upon non-hairy
portions of the body.

Ringworm of the general surface (tinea trichophytina corporis,
tinea circinata) appears as one or more small, slightly-elevated,
sharply-limited, somewhat scaly, hyper       mic spots, with, rarely,
minute papules, vesico-papules, or vesicles, especially at the circumference.
The patch spreads in a uniform manner peripherally, is
slightly scaly, and tends to clear in the centre, assuming a ring-like
appearance. When coming under observation, the patches are
usually from one-half to one inch in diameter, the central portion
pale or pale red, and the outer portion more or less elevated,
hyper       mic and somewhat scaly. As commonly noted one, several
or more patches are present. After reaching a certain size they may
[Pg 252]
remain stationary, or in exceptional cases may tend to spontaneous
disappearance. At times when close together, several may merge
and form a large, irregular, gyrate patch.

Itching, usually slight, may or may not be present.

Exceptionally ringworm appears as a markedly inflammatory pustular
circumscribed patch, formerly thought to be a distinct affection
and described under the name of conglomerate pustular folliculitis.
It consists of a flat carbuncular or kerion-like inflammation,
somewhat elevated, and usually a dime to silver dollar in area. The
most common seats are the back of the hands and the buttocks.
The surface is cribriform, and a purulent secretion may be pressed
out from follicular openings.

development. (After Piffard.)


Describe the symptoms of ringworm when occurring about
the thighs and scrotum.

In adults, more especially males, the inner portion of the upper
part of the thighs and scrotum (tinea trichophytina cruris, so-called
[Pg 253]
eczema marginatum) may be attacked, and here the affection, favored
by heat and moisture, develops rapidly and may soon lose its ordinary
clinical appearances, the inflammatory symptoms becoming
especially prominent. The whole of this region may become involved,
presenting all the symptoms of a true eczema; the border,
however, is sharply defined, and usually one or more outlying patches
of the ordinary clinical type of the disease may be seen.


Describe the symptoms of ringworm when involving the
nails.

In ringworm of the nails (tinea trichophytina unguium) these
structures become soft or brittle, yellowish, opaque and thickened
the changes taking place mainly about the free borders. Ringworm
on other parts usually coexists.


Describe the symptoms of ringworm as it occurs upon the
scalp.

Ringworm of the scalp (tinea trichophytina capitis, tinea tonsurans)
begins usually in the same manner as that upon the general
surface, but, as a rule, much more insidiously. Sooner or later,
however, the hair and follicles are invaded by the fungus, and in
consequence the hair falls out or becomes brittle and breaks off.
The follicles, except in long-standing cases, are slightly elevated and
prominent, and the patch may have a puffed or goose-flesh appearance.
In addition, there is slight scaliness.


Describe the appearances of a typical patch of ringworm of
the scalp.

The patch is rounded, grayish, somewhat scaly, and slightly elevated;
the follicles are somewhat prominent; there is more or less
alopecia, with here and there broken, gnawed-off-looking hairs, some
of which may be broken off just at the outlet of the follicles and
more or less surrounded by a whitish or grayish-white dust. This
type is produced by the small-spore fungus       microsporon.


Does ringworm of the scalp always present typical appearances?

Not invariably. In some cases the patch or patches may become
[Pg 254]
almost completely bald, and in others a tendency to the formation
of pustules, with more or less crust-formation, may be seen. The
affection may also appear as small scattered spots or points.

Fig. 69.






Ringworm (rather inflammatory type, and produced by the trichophyton).

[Pg 255]
The markedly inflammatory and pustular types are produced by
the large-spore fungus       trichophyton.


What is tinea kerion?

Tinea kerion (kerion) is a markedly inflammatory type of ringworm
of the scalp involving the deeper tissues, appearing as a more or
less bald, rounded, inflammatory,        dematous, boggy, honeycombed
tumor, discharging from the follicular openings a mucoid secretion.


Does ringworm of the scalp ever occur in adults?

No. (Extremely rare exceptions.)


Fig. 70.

Describe the symptoms of ringworm of the bearded region.

Ringworm of the bearded region (tinea trichophytina barb       , tinea
sycosis, parasitic sycosis, barber's itch) begins usually in the same
manner as ringworm on other parts, as one or more rounded, slightly
scaly, hyper       mic patches. In rare instances the disease may persist
as such, with very little tendency to involve the hairs and follicles;
but, as a rule, the hairy structures are soon invaded, many of the
hairs breaking off, and many falling out. From involvement of the
[Pg 256]
follicles, more or less subcutaneous swelling ensues, the parts assuming
a distinctly lumpy and nodular condition. The skin is usually
considerably reddened, often having a glossy appearance, and
studded with few or numerous pustules. The nodules tend, ordinarily,
to break down and discharge, at one or more of the follicular
openings, a glairy, glutinous, purulent material, which may dry to
thick, adherent crusts.

[Pg 257]
The disease may be limited to one patch, or a large area, even to
the extent of the whole bearded region, becomes involved. The
upper lip is rarely invaded. Ringworm of the bearded region is
due to the trichophyton.


Fig. 72.

To what is ringworm due?

To the presence and growth in the cutaneous structures of a
vegetable parasite. Although the disease is contagious, individuals
differ considerably as to susceptibility. It is much more common in
[Pg 258]
children than in those past the age of puberty, ringworm of the
scalp being limited to the former (rare exceptions), and tinea sycosis
being a disease of the male adult.

Until recently the ringworm was thought to be due to but one
fungus       the trichophyton; it is now known that there are several
forms of fungi, the main forms being the small-spored (microsporon
Audouini) and the large-spored (trichophyton). Of this latter
there are two main subvarieties       endothrix and ectothrix. The
small-spored fungus is found as the cause in the majority of scalp
cases; the endothrix also commonly invades the scalp integument.
The ectothrix variety is usually derived directly or indirectly from
domestic animals, and is chiefly responsible for body-ringworm, and
for suppurative ringworm, whether upon the bearded region or
elsewhere.


What is the pathology of ringworm?

On the general surface the fungus has its seat in the epidermis,
especially in the corneous layer; upon the scalp and bearded region
the epidermis, hair-shaft, root and follicle are invaded. The inflammatory
action may vary considerably in different cases, and at different
times in the same case.

The fungus consists of mycelium and spores. In the epidermic
scrapings it is never to be found in abundance, and the mycelium
predominates, while in affected hairs the spores and chains of spores
are almost exclusively seen, and are usually present in great profusion.


How do you examine for the fungus?

The scrapings or hair should be moistened with liquor potass       ,
and examined with a power from three hundred diameters upward.


How is ringworm of the general surface to be distinguished
from eczema, psoriasis and seborrh       a?

By the growth and characters of the patch, the slight scaliness,
the tendency to disappear in the centre, by the history, and, if
necessary, by a microscopic examination of the scales.


How is ringworm of the scalp to be distinguished from alopecia
areata, favus, eczema, seborrh       a, and psoriasis?

By the peculiar clinical features of ringworm on this region       the
[Pg 259]
slight scaliness, broken hair and hair stumps, with a certain amount
of baldness       and in doubtful cases by a microscopical examination of
the hairs.

In favus, although the same condition of the hair is noted, the
yellow, cup-shaped crusts, and the presence of the atrophic areas in
that disease are pathognomonic.


How is ringworm of the bearded region to be distinguished
from eczema and sycosis?

By the peculiar lumpiness of the parts, the brittleness of the hair,
more or less hair loss, and the history.

The superficial type of ringworm sycosis       those cases in which
the disease remains a surface disease       is readily distinguished, as
the symptoms are essentially the same as ringworm of non-hairy
parts, except that some of the hairs in the areas may become
invaded and break off or fall out.

In doubtful cases recourse may be had to microscopical examination.


What is the prognosis of ringworm of these several parts?

When upon the general surface, the disease usually responds rapidly
to therapeutical applications; upon the scalp it is always a stubborn
affection, and, as a rule, requires several months to a year of
energetic treatment to effect a cure. In this latter region the disease
will disappear spontaneously as the age of fifteen or sixteen is
reached. Tinea sycosis yields in most instances in the course of
several weeks or a few months.


Is ringworm of these several parts treated with the same
remedies?

As a rule, yes; but the strength must be modified. The scalp
will stand strong applications, as will likewise the bearded region;
upon non-hairy portions the remedies should be used somewhat
weaker. They should be applied twice daily; ointments, if used,
being well rubbed in, and lotions thoroughly dabbed on.


How would you treat ringworm of the general surface?

By applications of the milder parasiticides, such as a ten to fifteen
per cent. solution of sodium hyposulphite; carbolic acid, five to
thirty grains to the ounce of water, or lard; a saturated solution of
[Pg 260]
boric acid; ointments of tar, sulphur and mercury, official strength
or weakened with lard; and tincture of iodine, pure or diluted.

When occurring upon the upper and inner part of the thighs
(so-called eczema marginatum), the same remedies are to be employed,
but usually stronger. Deserving of special mention is a lotion
of corrosive sublimate, one to four grains to the ounce; or the same
remedy, in the same proportion, may be used in tincture of myrrh or
benzoin, and painted on the parts.


How would you treat ringworm of the scalp?

By occasional soap-and-hot-water washing; by extraction of the
involved hairs, when practicable; by carbolic acid or boric acid lotions
to the whole scalp, so as to limit, as much as possible, the spread of
the disease; and by daily (or twice daily) applications to the patches
and involved areas of a parasiticide. The following are the most
valuable: the oleate of mercury, with lard or lanolin, in varying
strength, from ten to twenty per cent.; carbolic acid, with one to
three or more parts of glycerine or oil; corrosive sublimate, in solution
in alcohol and water, one to four grains to the ounce; sulphur
ointment; and citrine ointment, with one or two parts of lard.
Chrysarobin is a valuable remedy, but is to be employed with care;
it may be prescribed as a rubber plaster, or in a solution of gutta-percha,
or as an ointment, ten to fifteen per cent. strength.       -naphthol
in ointment form, five to fifteen per cent. strength, is also useful.
An excellent application for beginning areas on the scalp is a solution
of the red iodide of mercury in iodine tincture, one to three
grains to an ounce.

A compound ointment, containing several of the active remedies
named, is convenient for dispensary practice, such as:       


                -naphthol, ......................................       ss-      j
    Ol. cadini, ......................................       j
    Ungt. sulphuris, ........................ q.s. ad.        j.   M.


In that form known as tinea kerion mild applications are demanded
at first; later the same treatment as in the ordinary type.


How is ringworm of the bearded region to be treated?

On the same general plan and with the same remedies (excepting
[Pg 261]
chrysarobin) as in ringworm of the scalp. Depilation is to be practised
as an essential part of the treatment. Special mention may be
made of an ointment of oleate of mercury, sulphur ointment, a
lotion of sodium hyposulphite (      j-       j), and a lotion of corrosive sublimate
(gr. j-iv to        j). The x-ray has been used in ringworm of
this region with alleged success, pushing it to the production of a
mild erythema and depilation. The above methods are, however,
usually successful, and are without risk of damage.


How is the certainty of an apparent cure in ringworm of
the scalp or bearded region to be determined?

By the continued absence of roughness and of broken hairs and
stumps, and by microscopical examination of the new-growing hairs
from time to time for several weeks after discontinuance of treatment.

Cure of ringworm of the general surface is usually self-evident.


Is systemic treatment of aid in the cure of ringworm?

It is doubtful, although in children in a depraved state of health
the disease is often noted to be especially stubborn, and in such
cod-liver oil and similar remedies may at times prove of benefit.


Tinea Imbricata.

(Synonym: Tokelau Ringworm.)


What is tinea imbricata?

A vegetable parasitic disease of moist tropical countries, characterized
by the formation of patches composed of concentrically
arranged, imbricated, scaly rings. It may begin at one or several
points as a brownish, slightly raised spot, spreading peripherally;
the renewed epidermis of the central part of the patch goes again
through the same process; the result is a small or large area of
concentrically arranged, imbricated, slightly scaly eruption. Several
such areas fusing together may cover a large part of the surface, the
ring-like arrangement being sometimes more or less completely lost.
The malady is chronic. There may be a variable degree of itching.
The cause of the disease, which is of a contagious nature, is a
[Pg 262]
vegetable parasite closely similar to the trichophyton. The treatment is
by the parasiticides, being essentially the same, in fact, as ringworm.


Tinea Versicolor.

(Synonyms: Pityriasis Versicolor; Chromophytosis.)


What is tinea versicolor?

Tinea versicolor is a vegetable-parasitic disease of the skin,
characterized by variously-sized and shaped, slightly scaly, macular
patches of a yellowish-fawn color, and occurring for the most part
upon the upper portion of the trunk.


Describe the symptoms of tinea versicolor.

The disease begins as one or more yellowish macular points; these,
in the course of weeks or months, gradually extend, and, together
with other patches that arise, may form a more or less continuous
sheet of eruption. There is slight scaliness, always insignificant and
furfuraceous in character, and at times, except upon close inspection,
scarcely perceptible. The color of the patches is pale or brownish-yellow;
in rare instances, in those of delicate skin, there may be
more or less hyper       mia, and in consequence the eruption is of a
reddish tinge. The number of patches varies; there may be but a
few, or, on the other hand, a profusion. Slight itching, especially
when the parts are warm, is usually present.


Does the eruption of tinea versicolor show predilection for
any special region?

Yes; the upper part of the trunk, especially anteriorly, is the usual
seat of the eruption, but in exceptional instances the neck, axill       , the
arms, the whole trunk, the genitocrural region and poplitea, and in
rare cases even the lower part of the face, may become invaded.


What course does tinea versicolor pursue?

Persistent, but somewhat variable; as a rule, however, slowly progressive
and lasting for years.


To what is tinea versicolor due?

To a vegetable fungus       the microsporon furfur.
[Pg 263]
The affection is tolerably common, and occurs in all parts of the
world. With rare exceptions, it is a disease of adults, and while
looked upon as contagious, must be so to an extremely slight degree.


Fig. 73.




Microsporon Furfur x 400. (After Duhring.)
Showing mycelium in various stages of development, groups of spores and free spores.


What is the pathology?

The fungus, consisting of mycelium and spores, the latter showing
a marked tendency to aggregate, invades the superficial portion of
the epidermis.


Is tinea versicolor readily diagnosticated?

Yes; if the color, peculiar characters and distribution of the eruption
are kept in mind.

It is not to be confounded with vitiligo, chloasma, or the macular
syphiloderm. If in doubt, have recourse to the microscope.


State the method of examination for fungus.

The scrapings are taken from a patch, moistened with liquor potass       ,
and examined with a power of three to five hundred diameters.


State the prognosis of tinea versicolor.

With proper management the disease is readily curable. Relapses
are not uncommon.
[Pg 264]



Fig. 74.






Tinea versicolor.


What is the treatment of tinea versicolor?

It consists in daily washing with soap and hot water (and in obstinate
cases with sapo viridis instead of the ordinary soap) and application
of a lotion of       sulphite or hyposulphite of sodium, a drachm to the
ounce; sulphurous acid, pure or diluted; carbolic acid, or resorcin,
ten to twenty grains to the ounce of water and alcohol; or corrosive
sublimate, one to three grains to the ounce of water. Sulphur and
ammoniated-mercury ointments are also serviceable. The following
used alone, simply as a soap, or in conjunction with a lotion, is often
of special value:       


          Sulphur, pr       cip., ................................       iv
    Saponis viridis, .................................       xii.   M.


[Pg 265]
After the disease is apparently cured, an occasional remedial
application should be made for several months, in order to guard
against the possibility of a relapse.


Erythrasma.
Erythrasma.


Describe erythrasma.

Erythrasma is an extremely rare disease, due to the presence and
growth in the epidermic structures of the vegetable parasite       the
microsporon minutissimum. It is characterized by small and large,
slightly furfuraceous, reddish-yellow or reddish-brown patches, occurring
usually on warm and moist parts, such as the axillary,
inguinal, anal and genitocrural regions. It is slowly progressive
and persistent, but is without disturbing symptoms other than occasional
slight itching.


Fig. 75.




Microsporon Minutissimum x 1000. (After Riehl.)

Treatment, which is rapidly effective, is the same as that employed
in tinea versicolor.


Dhobie Itch.

Dhobie itch is a name used in certain tropical countries to designate
a somewhat peculiar itching eruption of the genitocrural and
axillary regions, and by some also a similar eruption about the feet.
[Pg 266]
It consists of a dermatitis of variable degree, usually with a festooned,
irregular border, with considerable itching. It is believed
that such cases are variously due to the trichophyton of ringworm,
to the microsporon furfur of tinea versicolor, to the microsporon
minutissimus of erythrasma, and to other parasites.


Actinomycosis.


Describe actinomycosis.

Actinomycosis of the skin is an affection due to the ray fungus,
and characterized by a sluggish, red, nodular, or lumpy infiltration,
usually with a tendency to break down and form sinuses. The affection
may involve almost any part, but its most common site is
about the jaw, neck, and face. As a rule, the first evidence is a
hard subcutaneous swelling or infiltration, which may increase
slightly or considerably. The overlying skin gradually becomes
of a sluggish or dark-red color. Softening ensues, and the diseased
area breaks down at one or more points, from which there oozes a
discharge of a sero-purulent, purulent, or sanguinolent character.
In this discharge can be usually noted minute, friable, yellowish or
yellowish-gray bodies representing conglomerate collections of the
causative fungus.

The course of the malady is commonly slow and insidious. Unless
systemic pyemic infection occurs or the fungus elements find
their way to the deeper organs or structures the general health
remains apparently undisturbed.


What is the treatment?

The administration of moderate to large doses of potassium
iodide, conjointly with curetting or excision of the diseased mass.
Local applications of iodine solution can also be tried.


Blastomycetic Dermatitis.


What do you understand by blastomycetic dermatitis?

Blastomycetic dermatitis is a rare disease beginning usually as a
small papule or nodule, enlarging slowly, breaking down and developing
into a verrucous or papillomatous-looking area, similar in appearance







Blastomycetic dermatitis.


[Pg 267]
to tuberculosis cutis verrucosa. A muco-purulent or purulent
secretion can visually be pressed out from between the papillomatous
elevations. It may also present the appearance of a serpiginous
lupus vulgaris or syphiloderm. As a rule it is slow in its course.
Furuncular or abscess-like formations may develop, usually from
secondary infection. The disease is due to the invasion of the
cutaneous tissues by the blastomyces.

Treatment consists in administration of moderate to large doses
of potassium iodide, and in the employment of antiseptic and parasiticide
applications; usually, however, radical treatment, such as
employed in lupus vulgaris, may be necessary.


Scabies.

(Synonym: The Itch.)


What is scabies?

Scabies, or itch, is a contagious animal-parasitic disease characterized
by a multiform eruption of a somewhat peculiar distribution,
attended by intense itching.


Describe the symptoms of scabies.

The penetration and presence of the parasites within the cutaneous
structures besides often giving rise to several or more complete or
imperfectly formed burrows, excite varying degrees of irritation,
and in consequence the formation of vesicles, papules and pustules,
accompanied with more or less intense itching. Secondarily, crusting,
and at times a mild or severe grade of dermatitis, may be brought
about. The parasite seeks preferably tender and protected situations,
as between the fingers, on the wrists, especially the flexor surface,
in the folds of the axilla, on the abdomen, about the anal
fissure, about the genitalia, and in females also about the nipples,
and hence the eruption is most abundant about these regions. The
inside of the thighs and the feet are also attacked, as, indeed, may
be almost every portion of the body. The scalp and face are not involved;
exceptionally, however, these parts are invaded in infants
and young children.
[Pg 268]


Is the grade of cutaneous irritation the same in all cases of
scabies?

No; in those of great cutaneous irritability, especially in children,
the skin being more tender, the type of the eruption is usually much
more inflammatory. In those predisposed a true eczema may arise,
and then, in addition to the characteristic lesions of scabies, eczematous
symptoms are superadded; in long-persistent cases, indeed,
the burrows and other consequent lesions may be more or less completely
masked by the eczematous inflammation, and the true nature
of the disease be greatly obscured.


What do you mean by burrows?

Burrows, or cuniculi, are tortuous, straight or zigzag, dotted,
slightly elevated, dark-gray or blackish thread-like linear formations,
varying in length from an eighth to a half an inch.


Fig. 76.






Burrow, or cuniculus, greatly magnified. (After Kaposi.)
Showing the mite, ova, empty shells and excrement.


How is a burrow formed?

By the impregnated female parasite, which penetrates the epidermis
obliquely to the rete, depositing as it goes along ten or
fifteen ova, forming a minute passage or burrow.


Upon what parts are burrows most commonly to be found?

In the interdigital spaces, on the flexor surface of the wrists,
about the mamm        in the female, and on the shaft of the penis in
the male.
[Pg 269]


Are burrows usually present in numbers?

No. Several may be found in a single case, but they are rarely
numerous, as the irritation caused by the penetration of the parasites
leads either to violent scratching and their destruction, or gives
rise to the formation of vesicles and pustules, and consequently
their formation is prevented.


What course does scabies pursue?

Chronic and progressive, showing no tendency to spontaneous
disappearance.


To what is scabies due?

To the invasion of the cutaneous structures by an animal parasite,
the sarcoptes scabiei (acarus scabiei). The male mite is never found
in the skin and apparently takes no direct part in the production
of the symptoms.


Fig. 77.   FIG. 78.






Sarcoptes scabiei x 100. (After Duhring.)
Female. Ventral surface. Male.


The disease is contagious to a marked degree, and is most commonly
contracted by sleeping with those affected, or by occupying a
bed in which an affected person has slept. It occurs, for obvious
reasons, usually among the poor, although it is now quite frequently
met with among the better classes.
[Pg 270]


State the diagnostic features of scabies.

The burrows, the peculiar distribution and the multiformity of
the eruption, the progressive development, and usually a history of
contagion.


How do vesicular and pustular eczema differ from scabies?

Eczema is usually limited in extent, or irregularly distributed, is
distinctly patchy, with often the formation of large diffused areas;
it is variable in its clinical behavior, better and worse from time to
time, and differs, moreover, in the absence of burrows and of a
history of contagion.


How does pediculosis corporis differ from scabies?

In the distribution of the eruption. The pediculi live in the
clothing and go to the skin solely for nourishment, and hence the
eruption in that condition is upon covered parts, especially those
parts with which the clothing lies closely in contact, as around the
neck, across the upper part of the back, about the waist and down
the outside of the thighs; the hands are free.


State the prognosis of scabies.

It is favorable. The disease is readily cured, and, as soon as the
parasites and their ova are destroyed, the itching and the secondary
symptoms, as a rule, rapidly disappear.


How is scabies treated?

Treatment is entirely external, and consists of a preliminary soap-and-hot-water
bath, an application, twice daily for three days, of a
remedy destructive to the parasites and ova, and finally another bath.

Inquiry as to others of the family should be made, and, if affected,
treated at the same time. The wearing apparel should be looked
after       boiled, baked, or sulphur-fumigated.


What remedial applications are employed in scabies?

Sulphur, balsam of Peru, styrax, and       -naphthol, singly or severally
combined. In children, or in those of sensitive skin, the following:       


          Sulphur. pr       cip., ................................       iv
    Balsam. Peruv., ..................................       ij
    Adipis,
    Petrolati, .....................            ................        iss.   M.



[Pg 271]
And in adults, or those of non-irritable skin:       


          Sulphur, pr       cip., ................................        j
    Balsam. Peruv., ..................................        ss
          -Naphthol, ......................................       ij
    Adipis,
    Petrolati, ..............            ......... q.s. ad. ....        iv.   M.


Styrax is a remedy of value and is commonly employed as
an ointment in the strength of one part to two or three parts
of lard.


Is one such course of treatment sufficient to bring about a
cure?

Yes, in ordinary cases, if the applications have been carefully
and thoroughly made; exceptionally, however, some parasites and
ova escape destruction, and consequently itching will again begin to
show itself at the end of a week or ten days, and a repetition of the
treatment become necessary.


Does the secondary dermatitis which is always present in
severe cases require treatment?

Only when it is unusually persistent or severe; in such cases the
various soothing applications, lotions or ointments employed in acute
eczema are to be prescribed.


Is a dermatitis due to too active and prolonged treatment
ever mistaken for persistence of the scabies?

Yes.


Pediculosis.

(Synonyms: Phtheiriasis; Lousiness.)


Define pediculosis.

Pediculosis is a term applied to that condition of local or general
cutaneous irritation due to the presence of the animal parasite, the
pediculus, or louse.


Name the several varieties met with.

Three varieties are presented, named according to the parts involved,
[Pg 272]
pediculosis capitis, pediculosis corporis, and pediculosis pubis; the
parasite in each being a distinct species of pediculus.


Pediculosis Capitis.


Describe the symptoms of pediculosis capitis.

Pediculosis capitis (pediculosis capillitii), due to the presence of
the pediculus capitis, occurs much more frequently in children than
in adults. It is characterized by marked itching, and the formation
of various inflammatory lesions, such as papules, pustules and excoriations       
resulting from the irritation produced by the parasites and
from the scratching to which the intense pruritus gives rise. In
fact, an eczematous eruption of the pustular type soon results,
attended with more or less crust formation. In consequence of the
cutaneous irritation the neighboring lymphatic glands may become
inflamed and swollen, and in rare cases suppurate. The occipital
region is the part which is usually most profusely infested, more
especially in young girls and women. In those of delicate skin,
especially in children, scattered papules, vesico-papules, pustules,
and excoriations may often be seen upon the forehead and neck.
In some instances, however, especially in boys, there may be many
pediculi present, with but little cutaneous disturbance, the itching
being the sole symptom.

Ova of the headlouse attached to a hair. Magnified. (After Kaposi.)



[Pg 273]
In addition to the pediculi, which, as a rule, may be readily
found, their ova, or nits, are always to be seen upon the shaft of the
hairs, quite firmly attached.


Describe the appearance of the ova.

They are dirty-white or grayish looking, minute, pear-shaped
bodies, visible to the naked eye, and fastened upon
the shaft of the hairs with the small end toward
the root.

Is there any difficulty in the diagnosis of
pediculosis capitis?

No. The diagnosis is readily made, as the pediculi
are usually to be found without difficulty, and
even when they exist in small numbers and are not
readily discovered, the presence of the ova will indicate
the nature of the affection.

Pustular eruptions upon the scalp, especially
posteriorly, should always arouse a suspicion of
pediculosis. The possibility of the pediculosis
being secondary to eczema must not be forgotten.


What is the treatment of pediculosis capitis?

Treatment consists in the application of some
remedy destructive to the pediculi and their ova.
Crude petroleum is effective, one or two thorough
applications over night being usually sufficient; in
order to lessen its inflammability, and also to mask
its somewhat disagreeable odor, it may be mixed
with an equal part of olive oil and a small quantity
of balsam of Peru added.

Tincture of cocculus indicus, pure or diluted,
may also be applied with good results.

When the parts are markedly eczematous, an
ointment of ammoniated mercury or       -naphthol,
thirty to sixty grains to the ounce may be used.

Daily shampooing with soap and water, and the
twice daily application of a five per cent. carbolic
acid lotion, together with the use of a fine-toothed
comb, is a safe and efficient method for dispensary practice; as it is,
indeed, for any class of patients.
[Pg 274]


How are the ova or their shells to be removed from the hair?

By the frequent use of acid or alkaline lotions, such as dilute
acetic acid and vinegar, or solutions of sodium carbonate and borax.


Pediculosis Corporis.


Describe the symptoms of pediculosis corporis.

Pediculosis corporis is dependent upon the presence of the pediculus
corporis (pediculus vestimenti), a larger variety than that infesting
the scalp. It is characterized by more or less general itching,
together with various inflammatory lesions and excoriations. As
the parasites are to be found chiefly in the folds and seams of the
clothing, visiting the skin for the purpose of feeding, the various
symptoms       the minute hemorrhagic puncta showing the points at
which they have been sucking, and the consequent papules, pustules
and excoriations       are, therefore, to be found most abundantly on
those parts with which the clothing comes closely in contact, as, for
instance, around the neck, across the shoulders, around the waist,
and down the outside of the thighs. It is uncommon in children.

Pediculus Corporis x 25. (After Duhring.)
Female. Dorsal surface.

[Pg 275]


State the diagnostic characters of pediculosis corporis.

The presence of the minute hemorrhagic puncta, the multiform
character and peculiar distribution of the eruption. Careful search
will almost invariably disclose one or more pediculi.


What is the treatment of pediculosis corporis?

The clothing and bed-coverings are to be thoroughly baked or
boiled, the pediculi and their ova being in this manner destroyed;
a thymol or carbolized boric-acid lotion may be used to relieve the
cutaneous irritation.

When attention to the wearing apparel is not immediately practicable,
ointments of sulphur and staphisagria, and lotions of carbolic
acid, may be advised as temporary measures. The wearing of a
bag of loosely woven texture containing some lump sulphur next to
the skin is useful in such cases; at the temperature of the body the
sulphur undergoes slow oxidation. In hairy individuals the malady
is often persistent, due to the fact that ova have become attached to
the hair and a new progeny soon hatched out. Continued treatment
over a few weeks will usually suffice to rid the patient of their presence.


Pediculosis Pubis.


Describe the symptoms of pediculosis pubis.

Pediculosis pubis is a condition due to the presence of the
pediculus pubis, or crab-louse. It is characterized by more or
less itching about the genitalia, together with papules, excoriations,
and other inflammatory lesions. The amount of irritation varies;
it may be slight, or, on the other hand, severe. The parasite,
which is the smallest of the three varieties, may be discovered
upon close examination seated near the roots of the hairs, clutching
the hair, with its head downward and buried in the follicle. The
ova may be seen attached to the hair-shafts.

It infests adults chiefly, being in many instances probably contracted
through sexual intercourse.


Is the pediculus pubis found upon any other part of the body?

Yes. Although its favorite habitat is the region of the pubes, it
[Pg 276]
may, in exceptional instances, also infest the axill       , the sternal
region of the male, the beard, eyebrows, and even the eyelashes.


State the diagnostic characters of pediculosis pubis.

The region involved, itching, variable amount of irritation, and,
above all, the presence of the pediculi and their ova.


Fig. 82.




Pediculus Pubis x 25. (After Duhring.) Female. Dorsal surface.


Name several applications prescribed for pediculosis pubis.

A lotion of corrosive sublimate, one to four grains to the ounce;
infusion of tobacco; a ten to twenty per cent. ointment of oleate of
mercury; ammoniated mercury ointment, and a five to ten per cent.
      -naphthol ointment. Repeated washings with vinegar or dilute
acetic acid, or with alkaline lotions, will free the hairs of the ova.




Cysticercus Cellulos       .


Describe the cutaneous disturbance produced by the cysticercus
cellulos       .

The presence of cysticerci in the skin and subcutaneous tissue gives
rise to pea to hazelnut-sized, rounded, firm, movable tumors which,
when developed, may remain unchanged for months. The parasites
are disclosed by microscopic examination.

Most of the cases have been observed in Germany.
[Pg 277]


Filaria Medinensis.

(Synonym: Guinea-worm.)


State the character of the lesions produced by the filaria
medinensis.

The young microscopic worm penetrates the skin or deeper tissue,
where it grows gradually, finally reaching several inches or more in
length and about a half-line in thickness; inflammation is excited
and a tumor-like swelling makes its appearance, which, sooner or later,
breaks, disclosing the worm. It may also present a cord-like appearance.
It is rarely met with outside of tropical countries.

Treatment consists in gradual extraction, or in the injection of a
corrosive sublimate solution (1:1000) into the forming tumor. Asafetida
internally has been found to be curative, the parasite being
destroyed and subsequently absorbed or discharged.


Ixodes.

(Synonym: Wood-tick.)


State the character of the cutaneous disturbance produced
by the ixodes.

The tick sticks its proboscis into the skin and sucks blood until it
is several times its natural size, and then falls off; an urticarial
lesion results. If caught in the act the animal should not be forcibly
extracted, as its proboscis may be thus broken off and remain in the
skin, and give rise to pain and inflammation. It may be made to
relinquish its hold by placing on it a drop of an essential oil.

A thymol or carbolized boric-acid lotion will relieve the irritation.


Leptus.

(Synonym: Harvest-mite.)


State the characters of the lesion produced by the leptus.

This minute brick-red mite buries itself in the skin, especially
about the ankles and feet, giving rise to papules, vesicles and
pustules.

Treatment consists of the use of a mild sulphur ointment or of a
carbolic-acid lotion.
[Pg 278]


       strus.

(Synonym: Gad, or Bot-fly.)


Describe the cutaneous disturbance produced by the        strus.

The ova are deposited in the skin, develop and give rise to the
formation of furuncle-like tumors with central aperture, through
which a sanious discharge exudes; or as the result of the burrowing
of the larv       , irregular serpiginous lines or wheals are produced.

It is chiefly met with in Central and South America.

Larva migrant, or creeping disease, is doubtless in this same class.
It is characterized by a thread-like linear formation of an erythematous,
erythemato-papular, or vesicular nature that gradually extends,
the older part disappearing; considerable surface may be covered
before the parasite disappears or dies. The treatment consists in
endeavoring to destroy the organism by means of excision or caustic
applications at the point of its suspected site which is just ahead of
the extending line.


Pulex Penetrans.

(Synonyms: Sand Flea; Jigger.)


Describe the cutaneous disturbance produced by the pulex
penetrans.

This microscopic animal penetrates the skin, especially about the
toes, producing an inflammatory swelling, vesicle or pustule, or
even ulceration. It is met with in warm and tropical countries.

Treatment consists in extraction. Essential oils are used as a
preventive. A carbolic-acid or alkaline lotion relieves irritation.


Cimex Lectularius.

(Synonym: Bed-bug.)


Describe the characters of a bed-bug bite.

An inflammatory papule or wheal-like lesion results, somewhat
hemorrhagic; the purpuric or hemorrhagic point or spot remains
after the swelling subsides, but finally, in the course of several days
or a few weeks, disappears.

Treatment consists in the application of alkaline or acid lotions.
[Pg 279]


Culex.

(Synonym: Gnat; Mosquito.)


Describe the cutaneous disturbance produced by the culex.

It consists of an erythematous spot or a wheal-like lesion.

Alkaline or acid lotions usually give relief.


Pulex Irritans.

(Synonym: Common Flea.)


Describe the cutaneous disturbance produced by the pulex
irritans.

It consists of an erythematous spot with a minute central hemorrhagic
point. In irritable skin, a wheal-like lesion may result.

Treatment consists of applications of camphor or ammonia-water;
carbolic acid and thymol lotions are also useful.

SAUNDERS' TEXT-BOOKS CONTINUE TO GAIN

The list of text-books recommended in the various colleges again shows a
decided gain for the Saunders publications. During the present college
year, in the list of recommended books published by 164 colleges (the other
23 have not published lists), the Saunders books are mentioned 3278 times,
as against 3054 the previous year       an increase of 224. In other words, in
each of the medical colleges in this country an average of 20 (18-2/5 the previous
year) of the teaching books employed are publications issued by W. B.
Saunders Company. That this increase is not due alone to the publication
of new text-books, but rather to a most gratifying increase in the recommendation
of text-books recognized as standards, is at once evident from the following:
Ashton's Gynecology shows an increase of 19; DaCosta's Surgery,
an increase of 12; Hirst's Obstetrics, 14; Howell's Physiology, 25; Jackson
on the Eye, 16; Sahli's Diagnostic Methods, 11; Scudder's Fractures, 11;
Stengel's Pathology, 13; Stelwagon on the Skin, 11. These are but examples
of similar remarkable gains throughout the entire list, and is undoubted
evidence that the Saunders text-books are recognized as the best.

Bandler's
Medical Gynecology



Medical Gynecology. By S. Wyllis Bandler, M.D.,
Adjunct. Professor of Diseases of Women, New York Post-Graduate
Medical School and Hospital. Octavo of 680 pages,
with 135 original illustrations. Cloth, $5.00 net; Half Morocco,
$6.50 net.


JUST READY       EXCLUSIVELY MEDICAL GYNECOLOGY


This new work by Dr. Bandler is just the book that the physician engaged
in general practice has long needed. It is truly the practitioner's gynecology       planned
for him, written for him, and illustrated for him. There are
many gynecologic conditions that do not call for operative treatment; yet,
because of lack of that special knowledge required for their diagnosis and
treatment, the general practitioner has been unable to treat them intelligently.
This work gives just the information the practitioner needs. It not only
deals with those conditions amenable to non-operative treatment, but it also
tells how to recognize those diseases demanding operative treatment, so that
the practitioner will be enabled to advise his patient at a time when operation
will be attended with the most favorable results. The chapter on Pessaries
is especially full and excellent, the proper manner of introducing the pessary
being clearly described and illustrated with original pictures that show plainly
the correct technic of this procedure. The chapters on Vaginal and Abdominal
Massage, and particularly that on Artificial Hyperemia and Anemia, are
extremely valuable to the practitioner. They express the very latest advances
in these methods of treatment. Hydrotherapy, especially the Ferguson and
Nauheim baths, are treated in extenso, and Electrotherapy receives the full
consideration its importance merits. Pain as a symptom and its alleviation
is dealt with in an unusually practical way, its value as an aid in diagnosis
being emphasized. Gonorrhea and Syphilis and their many complications are
treated in detail, every care being taken to have these sections       of special
interest to the practitioner       complete in every particular. Other chapters of
great importance are those on Constipation, Sterility, Associated Nervous
Conditions in Gynecology, and Pregnancy and Abortion.



Kelly and Noble's Gynecology
and Abdominal Surgery

Gynecology and Abdominal Surgery. Edited by Howard
A. Kelly, M.D., Professor of Gynecology in Johns Hopkins
University; and Charles P. Noble, M.D., Clinical Professor of
Gynecology in the Woman's Medical College, Philadelphia. Two
imperial octavo volumes of 900 pages each, containing 650 illustrations,
mostly original. Per volume: Cloth, $8.00 net; Half
Morocco, $9.50 net.


BOTH VOLUMES NOW READY

WITH 650 ORIGINAL ILLUSTRATIONS BY HERMANN BECKER
AND MAX BR      DEL


In view of the intimate association of gynecology with abdominal surgery
the editors have combined these two important subjects in one work. For
this reason the work will be doubly valuable, for not only the gynecologist and
general practitioner will find it an exhaustive treatise, but the surgeon also will
find here the latest technic of the various abdominal operations. It possesses
a number of valuable features not to be found in any other publication covering
the same fields. It contains a chapter upon the bacteriology and one upon
the pathology of gynecology, dealing fully with the scientific basis of gynecology.
In no other work can this information, prepared by specialists, be
found as separate chapters. There is a large chapter devoted entirely to
medical gynecology, written especially for the physician engaged in general
practice. Heretofore the general practitioner was compelled to search through
an entire work in order to obtain the information desired. Abdominal surgery
proper, as distinct from gynecology, is fully treated, embracing operations
upon the stomach, upon the intestines, upon the liver and bile-ducts, upon the
pancreas and spleen, upon the kidney, ureter, bladder, and the peritoneum.
Special attention has been given to modern technic and illustrations of the very
highest order have been used to make clear the various steps of the operations.
Indeed, the illustrations are truly magnificent, being the work of Mr. Hermann
Becker and Mr. Max Br      del, of the Johns Hopkins Hospital.




Ashton's

RECENTLY ISSUED       NEW (3d) EDITION
THREE EDITIONS IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS

Three editions of this work have been demanded in eighteen months.
Among the new additions are: Colonic lavage and flushing, Hirst's treatment
for vaginismus, Dudley's treatment of cystocele, Montgomery's round
ligament operation, Chorio-epithelioma of the Uterus, Passive Incontinence of
the Urine, and Moynihan's methods in Intestinal Anastomosis. Nothing is left
to be taken for granted, the author not only telling his readers in every instance
what should be done, but also precisely how to do it. A distinctly original
feature of the book is the illustrations, numbering about one thousand line
drawings made especially under the author's personal supervision from actual
apparatus, living models, and dissections on the cadaver. These line drawings
show in detail the procedures and operations without obscuring their
purpose by unnecessary and unimportant anatomic surroundings.


Howard A. Kelly, M.D.

Professor of Gynecology, Johns Hopkins University.

       It is different from anything that has as yet appeared. The illustrations are particularly
clear and satisfactory. One specially good feature is the pains with which you
describe so many details so often left to the imagination.       


Charles B. Penrose, M.D.,

Formerly Professor of Gynecology, University of Pennsylvania.

       I know of no book that goes so thoroughly and satisfactorily into all the details of
everything connected with the subject. In this respect your book differs from the others.       


George M. Edebohls, M.D.

Professor of Diseases of Women, New York Post-Graduate Medical School.
       I have looked it through and must congratulate you upon having produced a text-book
most admirably adapted to teach gynecology to those who must get their knowledge,
even to the minutest and most elementary details, from books.

Cloth, $7.00 net; Half Morocco, $8.50 net.


RECENTLY ISSUED       FOR THE PRACTITIONER


Dr. Webster has written this work especially for the general practitioner,
discussing the clinical features of the subject in their widest relations to
general practice rather than from the standpoint of specialism. The magnificent
illustrations, three hundred and seventy-two in number, are nearly all
original. Drawn by expert anatomic artists under Dr. Webster's direct supervision,
they portray the anatomy of the parts and the steps in the operations
with rare clearness and exactness.


Howard A. Kelly, M.D., Professor of Gynecology, Johns Hopkins University.

       It is undoubtedly one of the best works which has been put on the market within
recent years, showing from start to finish Dr. Webster's well-known thoroughness. The
illustrations are also of the highest order.

Associate Professor of Gynecology, Johns Hopkins University.
Octavo of 275 pages, with original illustrations by Hermann
Becker and August Horn. Cloth, $5.00 net.


JUST READY

Dr. Cullen's large clinical experience and his extensive original work along
the lines of gynecologic pathology have enabled him to present his subject
with originality and precision. The work gives the early literature on
adenomyoma, traces the disease through its various stages, and then gives the
detailed findings in a large number of cases personally examined by the
author. Formerly the physician and surgeon were unable to determine the
cause of uterine bleeding, but after following closely the clinical course of
the disease, Dr. Cullen has found that the majority of these cases can be
diagnosed clinically. The results of these observations he presents in this
work. The entire subject of adenomyoma is dealt with from the standpoint
of the pathologist, the clinician, and the surgeon. The superb illustrations
are the work of Mr. Hermann Becker and Mr. August Horn, of the Johns
Hopkins Hospital.

RECENTLY ISSUED       NEW (2d) EDITION
WITH 701 ORIGINAL ILLUSTRATIONS


The new edition of this work has just been issued after a careful revision.
As diagnosis and treatment are of the greatest importance in considering diseases
of women, particular attention has been devoted to these divisions. To
this end, also, the work has been magnificently illuminated with 701 illustrations,
for the most part original photographs and water-colors of actual
clinical cases accumulated during the past fifteen years. The palliative treatment,
as well as the radical operative, is fully described, enabling the general
practitioner to treat many of his own patients without referring them
to a specialist. The author's extensive experience renders this work of unusual
value.




OPINIONS OF THE MEDICAL PRESS



Medical Record, New York

       Its merits can be appreciated only by a careful perusal.... Nearly one hundred pages
are devoted to technic, this chapter being in some respects superior to the descriptions in
many text-books.

       The author has given special attention to diagnosis and treatment throughout the book,
and has produced a practical treatise which should be of the greatest value to the student,
the general practitioner, and the specialist.

RECENTLY ISSUED


Immediately on its publication this work took its place as the leading text-book
on the subject. Both in this country and abroad it is recognized as the
most satisfactorily written and clearly illustrated work on obstetrics in the
language. The illustrations form one of the features of the book. They are
numerous and the most of them are original. In this edition the book has
been thoroughly revised. More attention has been given to the diseases of
the genital organs associated with or following childbirth. Many of the old
illustrations have been replaced by better ones, and there have been added a
number entirely new. The work treats the subject from a clinical standpoint.


OPINIONS OF THE MEDICAL PRESS



British Medical Journal

       The popularity of American text-books in this country is one of the features of recent
years. The popularity is probably chiefly due to the great superiority of their illustration
over those of the English text-books. The illustrations in Dr. Hirst's volume are far more
numerous and far better executed, and therefore more instructive, than those commonly
found in the works of writers on obstetrics in our own country.       


Bulletin of Johns Hopkins Hospital

       The work is an admirable one in every sense of the word, concisely but comprehensively
written.       


The Medical Record, New York

       The illustrations are numerous and are works of art, many of them appearing for the
first time. The author's style, though condensed, is singularly clear, so that it is never
necessary to re-read a sentence in order to grasp the meaning. As a true model of what a
modern text-book on obstetrics should be, we feel justified in affirming that Dr. Hirst's book
is without a rival.

JUST ISSUED


Regularly every year a new edition of this excellent text-book is called
for, and it appears to be in as great favor with physicians as with students.
Indeed, this book has taken its place as the ideal work for the general practitioner.
The author presents the best teaching of modern gynecology, untrammeled
by antiquated ideas and methods. In every case the most modern
and progressive technique is adopted, and the main points are made clear by
excellent illustrations. The new edition has been carefully revised, much
new matter has been added, and a number of new original illustrations have
been introduced. In its revised form this volume continues to be an admirable
exposition of the present status of gynecologic practice.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
