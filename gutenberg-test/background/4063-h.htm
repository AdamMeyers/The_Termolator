<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Sydney Smith</span>, of the same age as
Walter Scott, was born at Woodford, in Essex, in the year 1771,
and he died of heart disease, aged seventy-four, on the 22nd of
February, 1845.&nbsp; His father was a clever man of wandering
habits who, when he settled in England, reduced his means by
buying, altering, spoiling, and then selling about nineteen
different places in England.&nbsp; His mother was of a French
family from Languedoc, that had been driven to England by the
Revocation of the Edict of Nantes.&nbsp; Sydney Smith&rsquo;s
grandfather, upon the mother&rsquo;s side, could speak no
English, and he himself ascribed some of his gaiety to the French
blood in his veins.</p>
<p>He was one of four sons.&nbsp; His eldest brother
Robert&mdash;known as Bobus&mdash;was sent to Eton, where he
joined Canning, Frere, and John Smith, in writing the Eton
magazine, the <i>Microcosm</i>; and at Cambridge Bobus afterwards
was known as a fine Latin scholar.&nbsp; Sydney Smith went first
to a school at Southampton, and then to Winchester, where he
became captain of the school.&nbsp; Then he was sent for six
months to Normandy for a last polish to his French before he went
on to New College, Oxford.&nbsp; When he had obtained his
fellowship there, his father left him to his own resources.&nbsp;
His eldest brother had been trained for the bar, his two younger
brothers were sent out to India, and Sydney, against his own
wish, yielded to the strong desire of his father that he should
take orders as a clergyman.&nbsp; Accordingly, in 1794, he became
curate of the small parish of Netherhaven, in Wiltshire.&nbsp;
Meat came to Netherhaven only once a week in a butcher&rsquo;s
cart from Salisbury, and the curate often dined upon potatoes
flavoured with ketchup.</p>
<p>The only educated neighbour was Mr. Hicks Beach, the squire,
who at first formally invited the curate to dinner on Sundays,
and soon found his wit, sense, and high culture so delightful,
that the acquaintance ripened into friendship.&nbsp; After two
years in the curacy, Sydney Smith gave it up and went abroad with
the squire&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; &ldquo;When first I went into the
Church,&rdquo; he wrote afterwards, &ldquo;I had a curacy in the
middle of Salisbury Plain; the parish was Netherhaven, near
Amesbury.&nbsp; The squire of the parish, Mr. Beach, took a fancy
to me, and after I had served it two years, he engaged me as
tutor to his eldest son, and it was arranged that I and his son
should proceed to the University of Weimar in Saxony.&nbsp; We
set out, but before reaching our destination Germany was
disturbed by war, and, in stress of politics, we put into
Edinburgh, where I remained five years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Michael Beach, who had little taste for study, lived
with Sydney Smith as his tutor, and found him a wise guide and
pleasant friend.&nbsp; When Michael went to the University, his
brother William was placed under the same good care.&nbsp; Sydney
Smith, about the same time, went to London to be married.&nbsp;
His wife&rsquo;s rich brother quarrelled with her for marrying a
man who said that his only fortune consisted in six small silver
teaspoons.&nbsp; One day after their happy marriage he ran in to
his wife and threw them in her lap, saying, &ldquo;There, Kate,
you lucky girl, I give you all my fortune!&rdquo;&nbsp; The lucky
girl had a small fortune of her own which her husband had
strictly secured to herself and her children.&nbsp; Mr. Beach
recognised the value of Sydney Smith&rsquo;s influence over his
son by a wedding gift of &pound;750.&nbsp; In 1802 a daughter was
born, and in the same year Sydney Smith joined Francis Jeffrey
and other friends, who then maintained credit for Edinburgh as
the Modern Athens, in the founding of <i>The Edinburgh
Review</i>, to which the papers in this volume, added to the
Peter Plymley Letters, were contributed.&nbsp; The Rev. Sydney
Smith preached sometimes in the Episcopal Church at Edinburgh,
and presently had, in addition to William Beach, a son of Mr.
Gordon, of Ellon Castle, placed under his care, receiving
&pound;400 a year for each of the young men.</p>
<p>In 1803 Sydney Smith left Edinburgh for London, where he wrote
busily in <i>The Edinburgh Review</i>, but remained poor for many
years.&nbsp; His wit brought friends, and the marriage of his
eldest brother with Lord Holland&rsquo;s aunt quickened the
growth of a strong friendship with Lord Holland.&nbsp; Through
the good offices of Lord Holland, Sydney Smith obtained, in 1806,
aged thirty-five, the living of Foston-le-Clay, in
Yorkshire.&nbsp; In the next year appeared the first letter of
Peter Plymley to his brother Abraham on the subject of the Irish
Catholics.</p>
<p>These letters fell, we are told, like sparks on a heap of
gunpowder.&nbsp; All London, and soon all England, was alive to
the sound reason recommended by a lively wit.&nbsp; Sydney Smith
lived to be recognised as first among the social wits, and it was
always the chief praise of his wit that wisdom was the soul of
it.&nbsp; Peter Plymley&rsquo;s letters, and Sydney Smith&rsquo;s
articles on the same subject in <i>The Edinburgh Review</i> were
the most powerful aids furnished by the pen to the solution of
the burning question of their time.&nbsp; Lord Murray called the
Plymley letters &ldquo;after Pascal&rsquo;s letters the most
instructive piece of wisdom in the form of irony ever
written.&rdquo;&nbsp; Worldly wealth came later; but in wit,
wisdom, and kindly helpful cheerfulness, from youth to age,
Sydney Smith&rsquo;s life was rich.</p>

MY BROTHER ABRAHAM,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">WHO LIVES IN THE COUNTRY.</span><br />
BY PETER PLYMLEY.</p>
<h3>LETTER I.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Abraham</span>,&mdash;A worthier and
better man than yourself does not exist; but I have always told
you, from the time of our boyhood, that you were a bit of a
goose.&nbsp; Your parochial affairs are governed with exemplary
order and regularity; you are as powerful in the vestry as Mr.
Perceval is in the House of Commons,&mdash;and, I must say, with
much more reason; nor do I know any church where the faces and
smock-frocks of the congregation are so clean, or their eyes so
uniformly directed to the preacher.&nbsp; There is another point,
upon which I will do you ample justice; and that is, that the
eyes so directed towards you are wide open; for the rustic has,
in general, good principles, though he cannot control his animal
habits; and, however loud he may snore, his face is perpetually
turned towards the fountain of orthodoxy.</p>
<p>Having done you this act of justice, I shall proceed,
according to our ancient intimacy and familiarity, to explain to
you my opinions about the Catholics, and to reply to yours.</p>
<p>In the first place, my sweet Abraham, the Pope is not
landed&mdash;nor are there any curates sent out after
him&mdash;nor has he been hid at St. Albans by the Dowager Lady
Spencer&mdash;nor dined privately at Holland House&mdash;nor been
seen near Dropmore.&nbsp; If these fears exist (which I do not
believe), they exist only in the mind of the Chancellor of the
Exchequer; they emanate from his zeal for the Protestant
interest; and, though they reflect the highest honour upon the
delicate irritability of his faith, must certainly be considered
as more ambiguous proofs of the sanity and vigour of his
understanding.&nbsp; By this time, however, the best-informed
clergy in the neighbourhood of the metropolis are convinced that
the rumour is without foundation; and though the Pope is probably
hovering about our coast in a fishing-smack, it is most likely he
will fall a prey to the vigilance of our cruisers; and it is
certain that he has not yet polluted the Protestantism of our
soil.</p>
<p>Exactly in the same manner, the story of the wooden gods
seized at Charing Cross, by an order from the Foreign Office,
turns out to be without the shadow of a foundation; instead of
the angels and archangels, mentioned by the informer, nothing was
discovered but a wooden image of Lord Mulgrave, going down to
Chatham, as a head-piece for the <i>Spanker</i> gun-vessel; it
was an exact resemblance of his Lordship in his military uniform;
and <i>therefore</i> as little like a god as can well be
imagined.</p>
<p>Having set your fears at rest, as to the extent of the
conspiracy formed against the Protestant religion, I will now
come to the argument itself.</p>
<p>You say these men interpret the scriptures in an unorthodox
manner, and that they eat their god.&mdash;Very likely.&nbsp; All
this may seem very important to you, who live fourteen miles from
a market-town, and, from long residence upon your living, are
become a kind of holy vegetable; and in a theological sense it is
highly important.&nbsp; But I want soldiers and sailors for the
state; I want to make a greater use than I now can do of a poor
country full of men; I want to render the military service
popular among the Irish; to check the power of France; to make
every possible exertion for the safety of Europe, which in twenty
years&rsquo; time will be nothing but a mass of French slaves:
and then you, and ten other such boobies as you, call
out&mdash;&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, do not think of raising
cavalry and infantry in Ireland! . . . They interpret the Epistle
to Timothy in a different manner from what we do! . . . They eat
a bit of wafer every Sunday, which they call their God!&rdquo; .
. . I wish to my soul they would eat you, and such reasoners as
you are.&nbsp; What! when Turk, Jew, Heretic, Infidel, Catholic,
Protestant, are all combined against this country; when men of
every religious persuasion, and no religious persuasion; when the
population of half the globe is up in arms against us; are we to
stand examining our generals and armies as a bishop examines a
candidate for holy orders; and to suffer no one to bleed for
England who does not agree with you about the second of
Timothy?&nbsp; You talk about the Catholics!&nbsp; If you and
your brotherhood have been able to persuade the country into a
continuation of this grossest of all absurdities, you have ten
times the power which the Catholic clergy ever had in their best
days.&nbsp; Louis XIV., when he revoked the Edict of Nantes,
never thought of preventing the Protestants from fighting his
battles; and gained accordingly some of his most splendid
victories by the talents of his Protestant generals.&nbsp; No
power in Europe, but yourselves, has ever thought for these
hundred years past, of asking whether a bayonet is Catholic, or
Presbyterian or Lutheran; but whether it is sharp and
well-tempered.&nbsp; A bigot delights in public ridicule; for he
begins to think he is a martyr.&nbsp; I can promise you the full
enjoyment of this pleasure, from one extremity of Europe to the
other.</p>
<p>I am as disgusted with the nonsense of the Roman Catholic
religion as you can be: and no man who talks such nonsense shall
ever tithe the product of the earth, nor meddle with the
ecclesiastical establishment in any shape; but what have I to do
with the speculative nonsense of his theology, when the object is
to elect the mayor of a county town, or to appoint a colonel of a
marching regiment?&nbsp; Will a man discharge the solemn
impertinences of the one office with less zeal, or shrink from
the bloody boldness of the other with greater timidity, because
the blockhead thinks he can eat angels in muffins and chew a
spiritual nature in the crumpets which he buys from the
baker&rsquo;s shop?&nbsp; I am sorry there should be such impious
folly in the world, but I should be ten times a greater fool than
he is, if I refused, till he had made a solemn protestation that
the crumpet was spiritless and the muffin nothing but a human
muffin, to lead him out against the enemies of the state.&nbsp;
Your whole argument is wrong: the state has nothing whatever to
do with theological errors which do not violate the common rules
of morality, and militate against the fair power of the ruler: it
leaves all these errors to you, and to such as you.&nbsp; You
have every tenth porker in your parish for refuting them; and
take care that you are vigilant and logical in the task.</p>
<p>I love the Church as well as you do; but you totally mistake
the nature of an establishment, when you contend that it ought to
be connected with the military and civil career of every
individual in the state.&nbsp; It is quite right that there
should be one clergyman to every parish interpreting the
Scriptures after a particular manner, ruled by a regular
hierarchy, and paid with a rich proportion of haycocks and
wheatsheafs.&nbsp; When I have laid this foundation for a
rational religion in the state&mdash;when I have placed ten
thousand well-educated men in different parts of the kingdom to
preach it up, and compelled everybody to pay them, whether they
hear them or not&mdash;I have taken such measures as I know must
always procure an immense majority in favour of the Established
Church; but I can go no further.&nbsp; I cannot set up a civil
inquisition, and say to one, you shall not be a butcher, because
you are not orthodox; and prohibit another from brewing, and a
third from administering the law, and a fourth from defending the
country.&nbsp; If common justice did not prohibit me from such a
conduct, common sense would.&nbsp; The advantage to be gained by
quitting the heresy would make it shameful to abandon it; and men
who had once left the Church would continue in such a state of
alienation from a point of honour, and transmit that spirit to
their latest posterity.&nbsp; This is just the effect your
disqualifying laws have produced.&nbsp; They have fed Dr. Rees,
and Dr. Kippis; crowded the congregations of the Old Jewry to
suffocation: and enabled every sublapsarian, and superlapsarian,
and semi-pelagian clergyman, to build himself a neat brick
chapel, and live with some distant resemblance to the state of a
gentleman.</p>
<p>You say the King&rsquo;s coronation oath will not allow him to
consent to any relaxation of the Catholic laws.&mdash;Why not
relax the Catholic laws as well as the laws against Protestant
dissenters?&nbsp; If one is contrary to his oath, the other must
be so too; for the spirit of the oath is, to defend the Church
establishment, which the Quaker and the Presbyterian differ from
as much or more than the Catholic; and yet his Majesty has
repealed the Corporation and Test Act in Ireland, and done more
for the Catholics of both kingdoms than had been done for them
since the Reformation.&nbsp; In 1778 the ministers said nothing
about the royal conscience; in 1793 no conscience; in 1804 no
conscience; the common feeling of humanity and justice then seem
to have had their fullest influence upon the advisers of the
Crown; but in 1807&mdash;a year, I suppose, eminently fruitful in
moral and religious scruples (as some years are fruitful in
apples, some in hops),&mdash;it is contended by the well-paid
John Bowles, and by Mr. Perceval (who tried to be well paid),
that this is now perjury which we had hitherto called policy and
benevolence.&nbsp; Religious liberty has never made such a stride
as under the reign of his present Majesty; nor is there any
instance in the annals of our history, where so many infamous and
damnable laws have been repealed as those against the Catholics
which have been put an end to by him; and then, at the close of
this useful policy, his advisers discover that the very measures
of concession and indulgence, or (to use my own language) the
measures of justice, which he has been pursuing through the whole
of his reign, are contrary to the oath he takes at its
commencement!&nbsp; That oath binds his Majesty not to consent to
any measure contrary to the interest of the Established Church;
but who is to judge of the tendency of each particular
measure?&nbsp; Not the King alone: it can never be the intention
of this law that the King, who listens to the advice of his
Parliament upon a read bill, should reject it upon the most
important of all measures.&nbsp; Whatever be his own private
judgment of the tendency of any ecclesiastical bill, he complies
most strictly with his oath, if he is guided in that particular
point by the advice of his Parliament, who may be presumed to
understand its tendency better than the King, or any other
individual.&nbsp; You say, if Parliament had been unanimous in
their opinion of the absolute necessity for Lord Howick&rsquo;s
bill, and the King had thought it pernicious, he would have been
perjured if he had not rejected it.&nbsp; I say, on the contrary,
his Majesty would have acted in the most conscientious manner,
and have complied most scrupulously with his oath, if he had
sacrificed his own opinion to the opinion of the great council of
the nation; because the probability was that such opinion was
better than his own; and upon the same principle, in common life,
you give up your opinion to your physician, your lawyer, and your
builder.</p>
<p>You admit this bill did not compel the King to elect Catholic
officers, but only gave him the option of doing so if he pleased;
but you add, that the King was right in not trusting such
dangerous power to himself or his successors.&nbsp; Now you are
either to suppose that the King for the time being has a zeal for
the Catholic establishment, or that he has not.&nbsp; If he has
not, where is the danger of giving such an option?&nbsp; If you
suppose that he may be influenced by such an admiration of the
Catholic religion, why did his present Majesty, in the year 1804,
consent to that bill which empowered the Crown to station ten
thousand Catholic soldiers in any part of the kingdom, and place
them absolutely at the disposal of the Crown?&nbsp; If the King
of England for the time being is a good Protestant, there can be
no danger in making the Catholic <i>eligible</i> to anything: if
he is not, no power can possibly be so dangerous as that conveyed
by the bill last quoted; to which, in point of peril, Lord
Howick&rsquo;s bill is a mere joke.&nbsp; But the real fact is,
one bill opened a door to his Majesty&rsquo;s advisers for trick,
jobbing, and intrigue; the other did not.</p>
<p>Besides, what folly to talk to me of an oath, which, under all
possible circumstances, is to prevent the relaxation of the
Catholic laws! for such a solemn appeal to God sets all
conditions and contingencies at defiance.&nbsp; Suppose Bonaparte
was to retrieve the only very great blunder he has made, and were
to succeed, after repeated trials, in making an impression upon
Ireland, do you think we should hear any thing of the impediment
of a coronation oath? or would the spirit of this country
tolerate for an hour such ministers, and such unheard-of
nonsense, if the most distant prospect existed of conciliating
the Catholics by every species even of the most abject
concession?&nbsp; And yet, if your argument is good for anything,
the coronation oath ought to reject, at such a moment, every
tendency to conciliation, and to bind Ireland for ever to the
crown of France.</p>
<p>I found in your letter the usual remarks about fire, fagot,
and bloody Mary.&nbsp; Are you aware, my dear Priest, that there
were as many persons put to death for religious opinions under
the mild Elizabeth as under the bloody Mary?&nbsp; The reign of
the former was, to be sure, ten times as long; but I only mention
the fact, merely to show you that something depends upon the age
in which men live, as well as on their religious opinions.&nbsp;
Three hundred years ago men burnt and hanged each other for these
opinions.&nbsp; Time has softened Catholic as well as Protestant:
they both required it; though each perceives only his own
improvement, and is blind to that of the other.&nbsp; We are all
the creatures of circumstances.&nbsp; I know not a kinder and
better man than yourself; but you, if you had lived in those
times, would certainly have roasted your Catholic: and I promise
you, if the first exciter of this religious mob had been as
powerful then as he is now, you would soon have been elevated to
the mitre.&nbsp; I do not go the length of saying that the world
has suffered as much from Protestant as from Catholic
persecution; far from it: but you should remember the Catholics
had all the power, when the idea first started up in the world
that there could be two modes of faith; and that it was much more
natural they should attempt to crush this diversity of opinion by
great and cruel efforts, than that the Protestants should rage
against those who differed from them, when the very basis of
their system was complete freedom in all spiritual matters.</p>
<p>I cannot extend my letter any further at present, but you
shall soon hear from me again.&nbsp; You tell me I am a party
man.&nbsp; I hope I shall always be so, when I see my country in
the hands of a pert London joker and a second-rate lawyer.&nbsp;
Of the first, no other good is known than that he makes pretty
Latin verses; the second seems to me to have the head of a
country parson and the tongue of an Old Bailey lawyer.</p>
<p>If I could see good measures pursued, I care not a farthing
who is in power; but I have a passionate love for common justice,
and for common sense, and I abhor and despise every man who
builds up his political fortune upon their ruin.</p>
<p>God bless you, reverend Abraham, and defend you from the Pope,
and all of us from that administration who seek power by opposing
a measure which Burke, Pitt, and Fox all considered as absolutely
necessary to the existence of the country.</p>
<h3>LETTER II.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Abraham</span>,&mdash;The Catholic
not respect an oath! why not?&nbsp; What upon earth has kept him
out of Parliament, or excluded him from all the offices whence he
is excluded, but his respect for oaths?&nbsp; There is no law
which prohibits a Catholic to sit in Parliament.&nbsp; There
could be no such law; because it is impossible to find out what
passes in the interior of any man&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; Suppose it
were in contemplation to exclude all men from certain offices who
contended for the legality of taking tithes: the only mode of
discovering that fervid love of decimation which I know you to
possess would be to tender you an oath &ldquo;against that
damnable doctrine, that it is lawful for a spiritual man to take,
abstract, appropriate, subduct, or lead away the tenth calf,
sheep, lamb, ox, pigeon, duck,&rdquo; &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.,
and every other animal that ever existed, which of course the
lawyers would take care to enumerate.&nbsp; Now this oath I am
sure you would rather die than take; and so the Catholic is
excluded from Parliament because he will not swear that he
disbelieves the leading doctrines of his religion!&nbsp; The
Catholic asks you to abolish some oaths which oppress him; your
answer is that he does not respect oaths.&nbsp; Then why subject
him to the test of oaths?&nbsp; The oaths keep him out of
Parliament; why, then, he respects them.&nbsp; Turn which way you
will, either your laws are nugatory, or the Catholic is bound by
religious obligations as you are; but no eel in the well-sanded
fist of a cook-maid, upon the eve of being skinned, ever twisted
and writhed as an orthodox parson does when he is compelled by
the gripe of reason to admit anything in favour of a
dissenter.</p>
<p>I will not dispute with you whether the Pope be or be not the
Scarlet Lady of Babylon.&nbsp; I hope it is not so; because I am
afraid it will induce His Majesty&rsquo;s Chancellor of the
Exchequer to introduce several severe bills against popery, if
that is the case; and though he will have the decency to appoint
a previous committee of inquiry as to the fact, the committee
will be garbled, and the report inflammatory.&nbsp; Leaving this
to be settled as he pleases to settle it, I wish to inform you,
that, previously to the bill last passed in favour of the
Catholics, at the suggestion of Mr. Pitt, and for his
satisfaction, the opinions of six of the most celebrated of the
foreign Catholic universities were taken as to the right of the
Pope to interfere in the temporal concerns of any country.&nbsp;
The answer cannot possibly leave the shadow of a doubt, even in
the mind of Baron Maseres; and Dr. Rennel would be compelled to
admit it, if three Bishops lay dead at the very moment the
question were put to him.&nbsp; To this answer might be added
also the solemn declaration and signature of all the Catholics in
Great Britain.</p>
<p>I should perfectly agree with you, if the Catholics admitted
such a dangerous dispensing power in the hands of the Pope; but
they all deny it, and laugh at it, and are ready to abjure it in
the most decided manner you can devise.&nbsp; They obey the Pope
as the spiritual head of their Church; but are you really so
foolish as to be imposed upon by mere names?&nbsp; What matters
it the seven-thousandth part of a farthing who is the spiritual
head of any Church?&nbsp; Is not Mr. Wilberforce at the head of
the Church of Clapham?&nbsp; Is not Dr. Letsom at the head of the
Quaker Church?&nbsp; Is not the General Assembly at the head of
the Church of Scotland?&nbsp; How is the government disturbed by
these many-headed Churches? or in what way is the power of the
Crown augmented by this almost nominal dignity?</p>
<p>The King appoints a fast-day once a year, and he makes the
bishops: and if the government would take half the pains to keep
the Catholics out of the arms of France that it does to widen
Temple Bar, or improve Snow Hill, the King would get into his
hands the appointments of the titular Bishops of Ireland.&nbsp;
Both Mr. C-&rsquo;s sisters enjoy pensions more than sufficient
to place the two greatest dignitaries of the Irish Catholic
Church entirely at the disposal of the Crown.</p>
<p>Everybody who knows Ireland knows perfectly well, that nothing
would be easier, with the expenditure of a little money, than to
preserve enough of the ostensible appointment in the hands of the
Pope to satisfy the scruples of the Catholics, while the real
nomination remained with the Crown.&nbsp; But, as I have before
said, the moment the very name of Ireland is mentioned, the
English seem to bid adieu to common feeling, common prudence, and
common sense, and to act with the barbarity of tyrants and the
fatuity of idiots.</p>
<p>Whatever your opinion may be of the follies of the Roman
Catholic religion, remember they are the follies of four millions
of human beings, increasing rapidly in numbers, wealth, and
intelligence, who, if firmly united with this country, would set
at defiance the power of France, and if once wrested from their
alliance with England, would in three years render its existence
as an independent nation absolutely impossible.&nbsp; You speak
of danger to the Establishment: I request to know when the
Establishment was ever so much in danger as when Hoche was in
Bantry Bay, and whether all the books of Bossuet, or the arts of
the Jesuits, were half so terrible?&nbsp; Mr. Perceval and his
parsons forget all this, in their horror lest twelve or fourteen
old women may be converted to holy water and Catholic
nonsense.&nbsp; They never see that, while they are saving these
venerable ladies from perdition, Ireland may be lost, England
broken down, and the Protestant Church, with all its deans,
prebendaries, Percevals, and Rennels, be swept into the vortex of
oblivion.</p>
<p>Do not, I beseech you, ever mention to me again the name of
Dr. Duigenan.&nbsp; I have been in every corner of Ireland, and
have studied its present strength and condition with no common
labour.&nbsp; Be assured Ireland does not contain at this moment
less than five millions of people.&nbsp; There were returned in
the year 1791 to the hearth tax 701,000 houses, and there is no
kind of question that there were about 50,000 houses omitted in
that return.&nbsp; Taking, however, only the number returned for
the tax, and allowing the average of six to a house (a very small
average for a potato-fed people), this brings the population to
4,200,000 people in the year 1791: and it can be shown from the
clearest evidence (and Mr. Newenham in his book shows it), that
Ireland for the last fifty years has increased in its population
at the rate of 50 or 60,000 per annum; which leaves the present
population of Ireland at about five millions, after every
possible deduction for <i>existing circumstances</i>, <i>just and
necessary wars</i>, <i>monstrous and unnatural rebellions</i>,
and all other sources of human destruction.&nbsp; Of this
population, two out of ten are Protestants; and the half of the
Protestant population are Dissenters, and as inimical to the
Church as the Catholics themselves.&nbsp; In this state of things
thumbscrews and whipping&mdash;admirable engines of policy as
they must be considered to be&mdash;will not ultimately
avail.&nbsp; The Catholics will hang over you; they will watch
for the moment, and compel you hereafter to give them ten times
as much, against your will, as they would now be contented with,
if it were voluntarily surrendered.&nbsp; Remember what happened
in the American war, when Ireland compelled you to give her
everything she asked, and to renounce, in the most explicit
manner, your claim of Sovereignty over her.&nbsp; God Almighty
grant the folly of these present men may not bring on such
another crisis of public affairs!</p>
<p>What are your dangers which threaten the
Establishment?&mdash;Reduce this declamation to a point, and let
us understand what you mean.&nbsp; The most ample allowance does
not calculate that there would be more than twenty members who
were Roman Catholics in one house, and ten in the other, if the
Catholic emancipation were carried into effect.&nbsp; Do you mean
that these thirty members would bring in a bill to take away the
tithes from the Protestant, and to pay them to the Catholic
clergy?&nbsp; Do you mean that a Catholic general would march his
army into the House of Commons, and purge it of Mr. Perceval and
Dr. Duigenan? or, that the theological writers would become all
of a sudden more acute or more learned, if the present civil
incapacities were removed?&nbsp; Do you fear for your tithes, or
your doctrines, or your person, or the English
Constitution?&nbsp; Every fear, taken separately, is so glaringly
absurd, that no man has the folly or the boldness to state
it.&nbsp; Every one conceals his ignorance, or his baseness, in a
stupid general panic, which, when called on, he is utterly
incapable of explaining.&nbsp; Whatever you think of the
Catholics, there they are&mdash;you cannot get rid of them; your
alternative is to give them a lawful place for stating their
grievances, or an unlawful one: if you do not admit them to the
House of Commons, they will hold their parliament in Potatoe
Place, Dublin, and be ten times as violent and inflammatory as
they would be in Westminster.&nbsp; Nothing would give me such an
idea of security as to see twenty or thirty Catholic gentlemen in
Parliament, looked upon by all the Catholics as the fair and
proper organ of their party.&nbsp; I should have thought it the
height of good fortune that such a wish existed on their part,
and the very essence of madness and ignorance to reject it.&nbsp;
Can you murder the Catholics?&nbsp; Can you neglect them?&nbsp;
They are too numerous for both these expedients.&nbsp; What
remains to be done is obvious to every human being&mdash;but to
that man who, instead of being a Methodist preacher, is, for the
curse of us and our children, and for the ruin of Troy and the
misery of good old Priam and his sons, become a legislator and a
politician.</p>
<p>A distinction, I perceive, is taken by one of the most feeble
noblemen in Great Britain, between persecution and the
deprivation of political power; whereas, there is no more
distinction between these two things than there is between him
who makes the distinction and a booby.&nbsp; If I strip off the
relic-covered jacket of a Catholic, and give him twenty stripes .
. . I persecute; if I say, Everybody in the town where you live
shall be a candidate for lucrative and honourable offices, but
you, who are a Catholic . . . I do not persecute!&nbsp; What
barbarous nonsense is this! as if degradation was not as great an
evil as bodily pain or as severe poverty: as if I could not be as
great a tyrant by saying, You shall not enjoy&mdash;as by saying,
You shall suffer.&nbsp; The English, I believe, are as truly
religious as any nation in Europe; I know no greater blessing;
but it carries with it this evil in its train, that any villain
who will bawl out, &ldquo;<i>The Church is in danger</i>!&rdquo;
may get a place and a good pension; and that any administration
who will do the same thing may bring a set of men into power who,
at a moment of stationary and passive piety, would be hooted by
the very boys in the streets.&nbsp; But it is not all religion;
it is, in great part, the narrow and exclusive spirit which
delights to keep the common blessings of sun and air and freedom
from other human beings.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your religion has always
been degraded; you are in the dust, and I will take care you
never rise again.&nbsp; I should enjoy less the possession of an
earthly good by every additional person to whom it was
extended.&rdquo;&nbsp; You may not be aware of it yourself, most
reverend Abraham, but you deny their freedom to the Catholics
upon the same principle that Sarah your wife refuses to give the
receipt for a ham or a gooseberry dumpling: she values her
receipts, not because they secure to her a certain flavour, but
because they remind her that her neighbours want it:&mdash;a
feeling laughable in a priestess, shameful in a priest; venial
when it withholds the blessings of a ham, tyrannical and
execrable when it narrows the boon of religious freedom.</p>
<p>You spend a great deal of ink about the character of the
present prime minister.&nbsp; Grant you all that you
write&mdash;I say, I fear he will ruin Ireland, and pursue a line
of policy destructive to the true interest of his country: and
then you tell me, he is faithful to Mrs. Perceval, and kind to
the Master Percevals!&nbsp; These are, undoubtedly, the first
qualifications to be looked to in a time of the most serious
public danger; but somehow or another (if public and private
virtues must always be incompatible), I should prefer that he
destroyed the domestic happiness of Wood or Cockell, owed for the
veal of the preceding year, whipped his boys, and saved his
country.</p>
<p>The late administration did not do right; they did not build
their measures upon the solid basis of facts.&nbsp; They should
have caused several Catholics to have been dissected after death
by surgeons of either religion; and the report to have been
published with accompanying plates.&nbsp; If the viscera, and
other organs of life, had been found to be the same as in
Protestant bodies; if the provisions of nerves, arteries,
cerebrum, and cerebellum, had been the same as we are provided
with, or as the Dissenters are now known to possess; then,
indeed, they might have met Mr. Perceval upon a proud eminence,
and convinced the country at large of the strong probability that
the Catholics are really human creatures, endowed with the
feelings of men, and entitled to all their rights.&nbsp; But
instead of this wise and prudent measure, Lord Howick, with his
usual precipitation, brings forward a bill in their favour,
without offering the slightest proof to the country that they
were anything more than horses and oxen.&nbsp; The person who
shows the lama at the corner of Piccadilly has the precaution to
write up&mdash;<i>Allowed by Sir Joseph Banks to be a real
quadruped</i>, so his Lordship might have said&mdash;<i>Allowed
by the bench of Bishops to be real human creatures</i>. . .
.&nbsp; I could write you twenty letters upon this subject; but I
am tired, and so I suppose are you.&nbsp; Our friendship is now
of forty years&rsquo; standing; you know me to be a truly
religious man; but I shudder to see religion treated like a
cockade, or a pint of beer, and made the instrument of a
party.&nbsp; I love the king, but I love the people as well as
the king; and if I am sorry to see his old age molested, I am
much more sorry to see four millions of Catholics baffled in
their just expectations.&nbsp; If I love Lord Grenville, and Lord
Howick, it is because they love their country; if I abhor . . .
it is because I know there is but one man among them who is not
laughing at the enormous folly and credulity of the country, and
that he is an ignorant and mischievous bigot.&nbsp; As for the
light and frivolous jester, of whom it is your misfortune to
think so highly, learn, my dear Abraham, that this political
Killigrew, just before the breaking-up of the last
administration, was in actual treaty with them for a place; and
if they had survived twenty-four hours longer, he would have been
now declaiming against the cry of No Popery! instead of inflaming
it.&nbsp; With this practical comment on the baseness of human
nature, I bid you adieu!</p>
<h3>LETTER III.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">All</span> that I have so often told you,
Mr. Abraham Plymley, is now come to pass.&nbsp; The Scythians, in
whom you and the neighbouring country gentleman placed such
confidence, are smitten hip and thigh; their Beningsen put to
open shame; their magazines of train oil intercepted, and we are
waking from our disgraceful drunkenness to all the horrors of Mr.
Perceval and Mr. Canning . . . We shall now see if a nation is to
be saved by school-boy jokes and doggrel rhymes, by affronting
petulance, and by the tones and gesticulations of Mr. Pitt.&nbsp;
But these are not all the auxiliaries on which we have to depend;
to these his colleague will add the strictest attention to the
smaller parts of ecclesiastical government, to hassocks, to
psalters, and to surplices; in the last agonies of England, he
will bring in a bill to regulate Easter-offerings: and he will
adjust the stipends of curates, when the flag of France is
unfurled on the hills of Kent.&nbsp; Whatever can be done by very
mistaken notions of the piety of a Christian, and by a very
wretched imitation of the eloquence of Mr. Pitt, will be done by
these two gentlemen.&nbsp; After all, if they both really were
what they both either wish to be, or wish to be thought; if the
one were an enlightened Christian who drew from the Gospel the
toleration, the charity, and the sweetness which it contains; and
if the other really possessed any portion of the great
understanding of his Nisus who guarded him from the weapons of
the Whigs, I should still doubt if they could save us.&nbsp; But
I am sure we are not to be saved by religious hatred, and by
religious trifling; by any psalmody, however sweet; or by any
persecution, however sharp; I am certain the sounds of Mr.
Pitt&rsquo;s voice, and the measure of his tones, and the
movement of his arms, will do nothing for us; when these tones
and movements, and voice brings us always declamation without
sense or knowledge, and ridicule without good humour or
conciliation.&nbsp; Oh, Mr. Plymley, this never will do.&nbsp;
Mrs. Abraham Plymley, my sister, will be led away captive by an
amorous Gaul; and Joel Plymley your firstborn, will be a French
drummer.</p>
<p>Out of sight, out of mind, seems to be a proverb which applies
to enemies as well as friends.&nbsp; Because the French army was
no longer seen from the cliffs of Dover; because the sound of
cannon was no longer heard by the debauched London bathers on the
Sussex coast; because the <i>Morning Post</i> no longer fixed the
invasion sometimes for Monday, sometimes for Tuesday, sometimes
(positively for the last time of invading) on Saturday; because
all these causes of terror were suspended, you conceived the
power of Bonaparte to be at an end, and were setting off for
Paris with Lord Hawkesbury the conqueror.&nbsp; This is precisely
the method in which the English have acted during the whole of
the revolutionary war.&nbsp; If Austria or Prussia armed, doctors
of divinity immediately printed those passages out of Habakkuk,
in which the destruction of the Usurper by General Mack, and the
Duke of Brunswick, are so clearly predicted.&nbsp; If Bonaparte
halted, there was a mutiny or a dysentery.&nbsp; If any one of
his generals were eaten up by the light troops of Russia, and
picked (as their manner is) to the bone, the sanguine spirit of
this country displayed itself in all its glory.&nbsp; What scenes
of infamy did the Society for the Suppression of Vice lay open to
our astonished eyes! tradesmen&rsquo;s daughters dancing, pots of
beer carried out between the first and second lesson, and dark
and distant rumours of indecent prints.&nbsp; Clouds of Mr.
Canning&rsquo;s cousins arrived by the waggon; all the
contractors left their cards with Mr. Rose; and every plunderer
of the public crawled out of his hole, like slugs, and grubs, and
worms after a shower of rain.</p>
<p>If my voice could have been heard at the late changes, I
should have said, &ldquo;Gently, patience, stop a little; the
time is not yet come; the mud of Poland will harden, and the
bowels of the French grenadiers will recover their tone.&nbsp;
When honesty, good sense, and liberality have extricated you out
of your present embarrassment, then dismiss them as a matter of
course; but you cannot spare them just now; don&rsquo;t be in too
great a hurry, or there will be no monarch to flatter, and no
country to pillage; only submit for a little time to be respected
abroad, overlook the painful absence of the tax-gatherer for a
few years, bear up nobly under the increase of freedom and of
liberal policy for a little time, and I promise you, at the
expiration of that period, you shall be plundered, insulted,
disgraced, and restrained to your heart&rsquo;s content.&nbsp; Do
not imagine I have any intention of putting servility and canting
hypocrisy permanently out of place, or of filling up with courage
and sense those offices which naturally devolve upon decorous
imbecility and flexible cunning: give us only a little time to
keep off the hussars of France, and then the jobbers and jesters
shall return to their birthright, and public virtue be called by
its own name of fanaticism.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such is the advice I
would have offered to my infatuated countrymen: but it rained
very hard in November, Brother Abraham, and the bowels of our
enemies were loosened, and we put our trust in white fluxes and
wet mud; and there is nothing now to oppose to the conqueror of
the world but a small table wit, and the sallow Surveyor of the
Meltings.</p>
<p>You ask me, if I think it possible for this country to survive
the recent misfortunes of Europe?&mdash;I answer you, without the
slightest degree of hesitation: that if Bonaparte lives, and a
great deal is not immediately done for the conciliation of the
Catholics, it does seem to me absolutely impossible but that we
must perish; and take this with you, that we shall perish without
exciting the slightest feeling of present or future compassion,
but fall amidst the hootings and revilings of Europe, as a nation
of blockheads, Methodists, and old women.&nbsp; If there were any
great scenery, any heroic feelings, any blaze of ancient virtue,
any exalted death, any termination of England that would be ever
remembered, ever honoured in that western world, where liberty is
now retiring, conquest would be more tolerable, and ruin more
sweet; but it is doubly miserable to become slaves abroad,
because we would be tyrants at home; to persecute, when we are
contending against persecution; and to perish, because we have
raised up worse enemies within, from our own bigotry, than we are
exposed to without, from the unprincipled ambition of
France.&nbsp; It is indeed a most silly and affecting spectacle
to rage at such a moment against our own kindred and our own
blood; to tell them they cannot be honourable in war, because
they are conscientious in religion; to stipulate (at the very
moment when we should buy their hearts and swords at any price)
that they must hold up the right hand in prayer, and not the
left; and adore one common God, by turning to the east rather
than to the west.</p>
<p>What is it the Catholics ask of you?&nbsp; Do not exclude us
from the honours and emoluments of the state because we worship
God in one way, and you worship Him in another.&nbsp; In a period
of the deepest peace, and the fattest prosperity, this would be a
fair request; it should be granted, if Lord Hawkesbury had
reached Paris, if Mr. Canning&rsquo;s interpreter had threatened
the Senate in an opening speech, or Mr. Perceval explained to
them the improvements he meant to introduce into the Catholic
religion; but to deny the Irish this justice now, in the present
state of Europe, and in the summer months, just as the season for
destroying kingdoms is coming on, is (beloved Abraham), whatever
you may think of it, little short of positive insanity.</p>
<p>Here is a frigate attacked by a corsair of immense strength
and size, rigging cut, masts in danger of coming by the board,
four foot water in the hold, men dropping off very fast; in this
dreadful situation how do you think the Captain acts (whose name
shall be Perceval)?&nbsp; He calls all hands upon deck; talks to
them of King, country, glory, sweethearts, gin, French prison,
wooden shoes, Old England, and hearts of oak; they give three
cheers, rush to their guns, and, after a tremendous conflict,
succeed in beating off the enemy.&nbsp; Not a syllable of all
this; this is not the manner in which the honourable Commander
goes to work: the first thing he does is to secure twenty or
thirty of his prime sailors who happen to be Catholics, to clap
them in irons, and set over them a guard of as many Protestants;
having taken this admirable method of defending himself against
his infidel opponents, he goes upon deck, reminds the sailors in
a very bitter harangue, that they are of different religions;
exhorts the Episcopal gunner not to trust to the Presbyterian
quartermaster; issues positive orders that the Catholics should
be fired at upon the first appearance of discontent; rushes
through blood and brains, examining his men in the Catechism and
thirty-nine Articles, and positively forbids every one to sponge
or ram who has not taken the Sacrament according to the Church of
England.&nbsp; Was it right to take out a captain made of
excellent British stuff, and to put in such a man as this?&nbsp;
Is not he more like a parson, or a talking lawyer, than a
thorough-bred seaman?&nbsp; And built as she is of heart of oak,
and admirably manned, is it possible, with such a captain, to
save this ship from going to the bottom?</p>
<p>You have an argument, I perceive, in common with many others,
against the Catholics, that their demands complied with would
only lead to further exactions, and that it is better to resist
them now, before anything is conceded, than hereafter, when it is
found that all concessions are in vain.&nbsp; I wish the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, who uses this reasoning to exclude
others from their just rights, had tried its efficacy, not by his
understanding, but by (what are full of much better things) his
pockets.&nbsp; Suppose the person to whom he applied for the
meltings had withstood every plea of wife and fourteen children,
no business, and good character, and refused him this paltry
little office because he might hereafter attempt to get hold of
the revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster for life? would not Mr.
Perceval have contended eagerly against the injustice of refusing
moderate requests, because immoderate ones may hereafter be
made?&nbsp; Would he not have said, and said truly, Leave such
exorbitant attempts as these to the general indignation of the
Commons, who will take care to defeat them when they do occur;
but do not refuse me the Irons and the Meltings now, because I
may totally lose sight of all moderation hereafter?&nbsp; Leave
hereafter to the spirit and the wisdom of hereafter; and do not
be niggardly now from the apprehension that men as wise as you
should be profuse in times to come.</p>
<p>You forget, Brother Abraham, that is a vast art, where
quarrels cannot be avoided, to turn public opinion in your favour
and to the prejudice of your enemy; a vast privilege to feel that
you are in the right, and to make him feel that he is in the
wrong: a privilege which makes you more than a man, and your
antagonist less; and often secures victory by convincing him who
contends that he must submit to injustice if he submits to
defeat.&nbsp; Open every rank in the army and the navy to the
Catholic; let him purchase at the same price as the Protestant
(if either Catholic or Protestant can purchase such refined
pleasures) the privilege of hearing Lord Castlereagh speak for
three hours; keep his clergy from starving, soften some of the
most odious powers of the tithing-man, and you will for ever lay
this formidable question to rest.&nbsp; But if I am wrong, and
you must quarrel at last, quarrel upon just rather than unjust
grounds; divide the Catholic and unite the Protestant; be just,
and your own exertions will be more formidable and their
exertions less formidable; be just, and you will take away from
their party all the best and wisest understandings of both
persuasions, and knit them firmly to your own cause.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thrice is he armed who has his quarrel just;&rdquo; and
ten times as much may he be taxed.&nbsp; In the beginning of any
war, however destitute of common sense, every mob will roar, and
every Lord of the Bedchamber address; but if you are engaged in a
war that is to last for years, and to require important
sacrifices, take care to make the justice of your case so clear
and so obvious that it cannot be mistaken by the most illiterate
country gentleman who rides the earth.&nbsp; Nothing, in fact,
can be so grossly absurd as the argument which says I will deny
justice to you now, because I suspect future injustice from
you.&nbsp; At this rate, you may lock a man up in your stable,
and refuse to let him out, because you suspect that he has an
intention, at some future period, of robbing your
hen-roost.&nbsp; You may horsewhip him at Lady Day, because you
believe he will affront you at Midsummer.&nbsp; You may commit a
greater evil, to guard against a less which is merely contingent,
and may never happen.&nbsp; You may do what you have done a
century ago in Ireland, make the Catholics worse than Helots,
because you suspected that they might hereafter aspire to be more
than fellow citizens; rendering their sufferings certain from
your jealousy, while yours were only doubtful from their
ambition; an ambition sure to be excited by the very measures
which were taken to prevent it.</p>
<p>The physical strength of the Catholics will not be greater
because you give them a share of political power.&nbsp; You may
by these means turn rebels into friends; but I do not see how you
make rebels more formidable.&nbsp; If they taste of the honey of
lawful power, they will love the hive from whence they procure
it; if they will struggle with us like men in the same state for
civil influence, we are safe.&nbsp; All that I dread is the
physical strength of four millions of men combined with an
invading French army.&nbsp; If you are to quarrel at last with
this enormous population, still put it off as long as you can;
you must gain, and cannot lose, by the delay.&nbsp; The state of
Europe cannot be worse; the conviction which the Catholics
entertain of your tyranny and injustice cannot be more alarming,
nor the opinions of your own people more divided.&nbsp; Time,
which produces such effect upon brass and marble, may inspire one
Minister with modesty and another with compassion; every
circumstance may be better; some certainly will be so, none can
be worse; and after all the evil may never happen.</p>
<p>You have got hold, I perceive, of all the vulgar English
stories respecting the hereditary transmission of forfeited
property, and seriously believe that every Catholic beggar wears
the terriers of his father&rsquo;s land next his skin, and is
only waiting for better times to cut the throat of the Protestant
possessor, and get drunk in the hall of his ancestors.&nbsp;
There is one irresistible answer to this mistake, and that is,
that the forfeited lands are purchased indiscriminately by
Catholic and Protestant, and that the Catholic purchaser never
objects to such a title.&nbsp; Now the land so purchased by a
Catholic is either his own family estate, or it is not.&nbsp; If
it is, you suppose him so desirous of coming into possession that
he resorts to the double method of rebellion and purchase; if it
is not his own family estate of which he becomes the purchaser,
you suppose him first to purchase, then to rebel, in order to
defeat the purchase.&nbsp; These things may happen in Ireland,
but it is totally impossible they can happen anywhere else.&nbsp;
In fact, what land can any man of any sect purchase in Ireland,
but forfeited property?&nbsp; In all other oppressed countries
which I have ever heard of, the rapacity of the conqueror was
bounded by the territorial limits in which the objects of his
avarice were contained; but Ireland has been actually confiscated
twice over, as a cat is twice killed by a wicked parish boy.</p>
<p>I admit there is a vast luxury in selecting a particular set
of Christians, and in worrying them as a boy worries a puppy dog;
it is an amusement in which all the young English are brought up
from their earliest days.&nbsp; I like the idea of saying to men
who use a different hassock from me, that till they change their
hassock they shall never be Colonels, Aldermen, or
Parliament-men.&nbsp; While I am gratifying my personal insolence
respecting religious forms, I fondle myself into an idea that I
am religious, and that I am doing my duty in the most exemplary,
as I certainly am in the most easy, way.&nbsp; But then, my good
Abraham, this sport, admirable as it is, is become, with respect
to the Catholics, a little dangerous; and if we are not extremely
careful in taking the amusement, we shall tumble into the holy
water and be drowned.&nbsp; As it seems necessary to your idea of
an established church to have somebody to worry and torment,
suppose we were to select for this purpose William Wilberforce,
Esq., and the patent Christians of Clapham.&nbsp; We shall by
this expedient enjoy the same opportunity for cruelty and
injustice, without being exposed to the same risks: we will
compel them to abjure vital clergymen by a public test, to deny
that the said William Wilberforce has any power of working
miracles, touching for barrenness or any other infirmity, or that
he is endowed with any preternatural gift whatever.&nbsp; We will
swear them to the doctrine of good works, compel them to preach
common sense, and to hear it; to frequent Bishops, Deans, and
other High Churchmen; and to appear, once in the quarter at the
least, at some melodrame, opera, pantomime, or other light
scenical representation; in short, we will gratify the love of
insolence and power; we will enjoy the old orthodox sport of
witnessing the impotent anger of men compelled to submit to civil
degradation, or to sacrifice their notions of truth to
ours.&nbsp; And all this we may do without the slightest risk,
because their numbers are, as yet, not very considerable.&nbsp;
Cruelty and injustice must, of course, exist; but why connect
them with danger?&nbsp; Why torture a bulldog when you can get a
frog or a rabbit?&nbsp; I am sure my proposal will meet with the
most universal approbation.&nbsp; Do not be apprehensive of any
opposition from ministers.&nbsp; If it is a case of hatred, we
are sure that one man will defend it by the Gospel: if it
abridges human freedom, we know that another will find precedents
for it in the Revolution.</p>
<p>In the name of Heaven, what are we to gain by suffering
Ireland to be rode by that faction which now predominates over
it?&nbsp; Why are we to endanger our own Church and State, not
for 500,000 Episcopalians, but for ten or twelve great Orange
families, who have been sucking the blood of that country for
these hundred years last past? and the folly of the Orangemen in
playing this game themselves, is almost as absurd as ours in
playing it for them.&nbsp; They ought to have the sense to see
that their business now is to keep quietly the lands and beeves
of which the fathers of the Catholics were robbed in days of
yore; they must give to their descendants the sop of political
power: by contending with them for names, they will lose
realities, and be compelled to beg their potatoes in a foreign
land, abhorred equally by the English, who have witnessed their
oppression, and by the Catholic Irish, who have smarted under
them.</p>
<h3>LETTER IV.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Then</span> comes Mr. Isaac Hawkins Brown
(the gentleman who danced so badly at the Court of Naples), and
asks if it is not an anomaly to educate men in another religion
than your own.&nbsp; It certainly is our duty to get rid of
error, and, above all, of religious error; but this is not to be
done <i>per saltum</i>, or the measure will miscarry, like the
Queen.&nbsp; It may be very easy to dance away the royal embryo
of a great kingdom; but Mr. Hawkins Brown must look before he
leaps, when his object is to crush an opposite sect in religion;
false steps aid the one effect as much as they are fatal to the
other: it will require not only the lapse of Mr. Hawkins Brown,
but the lapse of centuries, before the absurdities of the
Catholic religion are laughed at as much as they deserve to be;
but surely, in the meantime, the Catholic religion is better than
none; four millions of Catholics are better than four millions of
wild beasts; two hundred priests educated by our own government
are better than the same number educated by the man who means to
destroy us.</p>
<p>The whole sum now appropriated by Government to the religious
education of four millions of Christians is &pound;13,000; a sum
about one hundred times as large being appropriated in the same
country to about one-eighth part of this number of
Protestants.&nbsp; When it was proposed to raise this grant from
&pound;8,000 to &pound;13,000, its present amount, this sum was
objected to by that most indulgent of Christians, Mr. Spencer
Perceval, as enormous; he himself having secured for his own
eating and drinking, and the eating and drinking of the Master
and Miss Percevals, the reversionary sum of &pound;21,000 a year
of the public money, and having just failed in a desperate and
rapacious attempt to secure to himself for life the revenues of
the Duchy of Lancaster: and the best of it is, that this
minister, after abusing his predecessors for their impious bounty
to the Catholics, has found himself compelled, from the
apprehension of immediate danger, to grant the sum in question,
thus dissolving his pearl in vinegar, and destroying all the
value of the gift by the virulence and reluctance with which it
was granted.</p>
<p>I hear from some persons in Parliament, and from others in the
sixpenny societies for debate, a great deal about unalterable
laws passed at the Revolution.&nbsp; When I hear any man talk of
an unalterable law, the only effect it produces upon me is to
convince me that he is an unalterable fool.&nbsp; A law passed
when there was Germany, Spain, Russia, Sweden, Holland, Portugal,
and Turkey; when there was a disputed succession; when four or
five hundred acres were won and lost after ten years&rsquo; hard
fighting; when armies were commanded by the sons of kings, and
campaigns passed in an interchange of civil letters and ripe
fruit; and for these laws, when the whole state of the world is
completely changed, we are now, according to my Lord Hawkesbury,
to hold ourselves ready to perish.&nbsp; It is no mean
misfortune, in times like these, to be forced to say anything
about such men as Lord Hawkesbury, and to be reminded that we are
governed by them, but as I am driven to it, I must take the
liberty of observing that the wisdom and liberality of my Lord
Hawkesbury are of that complexion which always shrinks from the
present exercise of these virtues by praising the splendid
examples of them in ages past.&nbsp; If he had lived at such
periods, he would have opposed the Revolution by praising the
Reformation, and the Reformation by speaking handsomely of the
Crusades.&nbsp; He gratifies his natural antipathy to great and
courageous measures by playing off the wisdom and courage which
have ceased to influence human affairs against that wisdom and
courage which living men would employ for present
happiness.&nbsp; Besides, it happens unfortunately for the Warden
of the Cinque Ports, that to the principal incapacities under
which the Irish suffer, they were subjected after that great and
glorious revolution, to which we are indebted for so many
blessings, and his Lordship for the termination of so many
periods.&nbsp; The Catholics were not excluded from the Irish
House of Commons, or military commands, before the 3rd and 4th of
William and Mary, and the 1st and 2nd of Queen Anne.</p>
<p>If the great mass of the people, environed as they are on
every side with Jenkinsons, Percevals, Melvilles, and other
perils, were to pray for divine illumination and aid, what more
could Providence in its mercy do than send them the example of
Scotland?&nbsp; For what a length of years was it attempted to
compel the Scotch to change their religion: horse, foot,
artillery, and armed Prebendaries, were sent out after the
Presbyterian parsons and their congregations.&nbsp; The Percevals
of those days called for blood: this call is never made in vain,
and blood was shed; but, to the astonishment and horror of the
Percevals of those days, they could not introduce the book of
Common Prayer, nor prevent that metaphysical people from going to
heaven their true way, instead of our true way.&nbsp; With a
little oatmeal for food, and a little sulphur for friction,
allaying cutaneous irritation with the one hand, and holding his
Calvinistical creed in the other, Sawney ran away to his flinty
hills, sung his psalm out of tune his own way, and listened to
his sermon of two hours long, amid the rough and imposing
melancholy of the tallest thistles.&nbsp; But Sawney brought up
his unbreeched offspring in a cordial hatred of his oppressors;
and Scotland was as much a part of the weakness of England then
as Ireland is at this moment.&nbsp; The true and the only remedy
was applied; the Scotch were suffered to worship God after their
own tiresome manner, without pain, penalty, or privation.&nbsp;
No lightning descended from heaven: the country was not ruined;
the world is not yet come to an end; the dignitaries who foretold
all these consequences are utterly forgotten, and Scotland has
ever since been an increasing source of strength to Great
Britain.&nbsp; In the six hundredth year of our empire over
Ireland we are making laws to transport a man if he is found out
of his house after eight o&rsquo;clock at night.&nbsp; That this
is necessary I know too well; but tell me why it is
necessary.&nbsp; It is not necessary in Greece, where the Turks
are masters.</p>
<p>Are you aware that there is at this moment a universal clamour
throughout the whole of Ireland against the Union?&nbsp; It is
now one month since I returned from that country; I have never
seen so extraordinary, so alarming, and so rapid a change in the
sentiments of any people.&nbsp; Those who disliked the Union
before are quite furious against it now; those who doubted doubt
no more; those who were friendly to it have exchanged that
friendship for the most rooted aversion; in the midst of all this
(which is by far the most alarming symptom), there is the
strongest disposition on the part of the northern Dissenters to
unite with the Catholics, irritated by the faithless injustice
with which they have been treated.&nbsp; If this combination does
take place (mark what I say to you), you will have meetings all
over Ireland for the cry of <i>No Union</i>; that cry will spread
like wild-fire, and blaze over every opposition; and if this be
the case, there is no use in mincing the matter; Ireland is gone,
and the death-blow of England is struck; and this event may
happen <i>instantly</i>&mdash;before Mr. Canning and Mr. Hookham
Frere have turned Lord Howick&rsquo;s last speech into doggerel
rhymne; before &ldquo;<i>the near and dear relations</i>&rdquo;
have received another quarter of their pension, or Mr. Perceval
conducted the Curates&rsquo; Salary Bill safely to a third
reading.&nbsp; If the mind of the English people, cursed as they
now are with that madness of religious dissension which has been
breathed into them for the purposes of private ambition, can be
alarmed by any remembrances, and warned by any events, they
should never forget how nearly Ireland was lost to this country
during the American war; that it was saved merely by the jealousy
of the Protestant Irish towards the Catholics, then a much more
insignificant and powerless body than they now are.&nbsp; The
Catholic and the Dissenter have since combined together against
you.&nbsp; Last war, the winds, those ancient and unsubsidised
allies of England; the winds, upon which English ministers depend
as much for saving kingdoms as washerwomen do for drying clothes;
the winds stood your friends: the French could only get into
Ireland in small numbers, and the rebels were defeated.&nbsp;
Since then, all the remaining kingdoms of Europe have been
destroyed; and the Irish see that their national independence is
gone, without having received any single one of those advantages
which they were taught to expect from the sacrifice.&nbsp; All
good things were to flow from the Union; they have none of them
gained anything.&nbsp; Every man&rsquo;s pride is wounded by it;
no man&rsquo;s interest is promoted.&nbsp; In the seventh year of
that union four million Catholics, lured by all kinds of promises
to yield up the separate dignity and sovereignty of their
country, are forced to squabble with such a man as Mr. Spencer
Perceval for five thousand pounds with which to educate their
children in their own mode of worship, he, the same Mr. Spencer,
having secured to his own Protestant self a reversionary portion
of the public money amounting to four times that sum.&nbsp; A
senior Proctor of the University of Oxford, the head of a house,
or the examining chaplain to a bishop, may believe these things
can last; but every man of the world, whose understanding has
been exercised in the business of life, must see (and see with a
breaking heart) that they will soon come to a fearful
termination.</p>
<p>Our conduct to Ireland during the whole of this war has been
that of a man who subscribes to hospitals, weeps at charity
sermons, carries out broth and blankets to beggars, and then
comes home and beats his wife and children.&nbsp; We had
compassion for the victims of all other oppression and injustice
except our own.&nbsp; If Switzerland was threatened, away went a
Treasury Clerk with a hundred thousand pounds for Switzerland;
large bags of money were kept constantly under sailing orders;
upon the slightest demonstration towards Naples, down went Sir
William Hamilton upon his knees, and begged for the love of St.
Januarius they would help us off with a little money; all the
arts of Machiavel were resorted to to persuade Europe to borrow;
troops were sent off in all directions to save the Catholic and
Protestant world; the Pope himself was guarded by a regiment of
English dragoons; if the Grand Lama had been at hand, he would
have had another; every Catholic clergyman who had the good
fortune to be neither English nor Irish was immediately provided
with lodging, soap, crucifix, missal, chapel-beads, relics, and
holy water; if Turks had landed, Turks would have received an
order from the Treasury for coffee, opium, korans, and
seraglios.&nbsp; In the midst of all this fury of saving and
defending this crusade for conscience and Christianity, there was
a universal agreement among all descriptions of people to
continue every species of internal persecution, to deny at home
every just right that had been denied before, to pummel poor Dr.
Abraham Rees and his Dissenters, and to treat the unhappy
Catholics of Ireland as if their tongues were mute, their heels
cloven, their nature brutal, and designedly subjected by
Providence to their Orange masters.</p>
<p>How would my admirable brother, the Rev. Abraham Plymley, like
to be marched to a Catholic chapel, to be sprinkled with the
sanctified contents of a pump, to hear a number of false
quantities in the Latin tongue, and to see a number of persons
occupied in making right angles upon the breast and
forehead?&nbsp; And if all this would give you so much pain, what
right have you to march Catholic soldiers to a place of worship,
where there is no aspersion, no rectangular gestures, and where
they understand every word they hear, having first, in order to
get him to enlist, made a solemn promise to the contrary?&nbsp;
Can you wonder, after this, that the Catholic priest stops the
recruiting in Ireland, as he is now doing to a most alarming
degree?</p>
<p>The late question concerning military rank did not
individually affect the lowest persons of the Catholic
persuasion; but do you imagine they do not sympathise with the
honour and disgrace of their superiors?&nbsp; Do you think that
satisfaction and dissatisfaction do not travel down from Lord
Fingal to the most potato-less Catholic in Ireland, and that the
glory or shame of the sect is not felt by many more than these
conditions personally and corporeally affect?&nbsp; Do you
suppose that the detection of Sir Henry Mildmay, and the
disappointment of Mr. Perceval <i>in the matter</i> of the Duchy
of Lancaster, did not affect every dabbler in public
property?&nbsp; Depend upon it these things were felt through all
the gradations of small plunderers, down to him who filches a
pound of tobacco from the King&rsquo;s warehouses; while, on the
contrary, the acquittal of any noble and official thief would not
fail to diffuse the most heart-felt satisfaction over the
larcenous and burglarious world.&nbsp; Observe, I do not say
because the lower Catholics are affected by what concerns their
superiors, that they are not affected by what concerns
themselves.&nbsp; There is no disguising the horrid truth,
<i>there must be some relaxation with respect to tithe</i>: this
is the cruel and heart-rending price which must be paid for
national preservation.&nbsp; I feel how little existence will be
worth having, if any alteration, however slight, is made in the
property of Irish rectors; I am conscious how much such changes
must affect the daily and hourly comforts of every Englishman; I
shall feel too happy if they leave Europe untouched, and are not
ultimately fatal to the destinies of America; but I am madly bent
upon keeping foreign enemies out of the British empire, and my
limited understanding presents me with no other means of
effecting my object.</p>
<p>You talk of waiting till another reign before any alteration
is made; a proposal full of good sense and good nature, if the
measure in question were to pull down St. James&rsquo;s Palace,
or to alter Kew Gardens.&nbsp; Will Bonaparte agree to put off
his intrigues, and his invasion of Ireland?&nbsp; If so, I will
overlook the question of justice, and finding the danger
suspended, agree to the delay.&nbsp; I sincerely hope this reign
may last many years, yet the delay of a single session of
Parliament may be fatal; but if another year elapse without some
serious concession made to the Catholics, I believe, before God,
that all future pledges and concessions will be made in
vain.&nbsp; I do not think that peace will do you any good under
such circumstances.&nbsp; If Bonaparte give you a respite, it
will only be to get ready the gallows on which he means to hang
you.&nbsp; The Catholic and the Dissenter can unite in peace as
well as war.&nbsp; If they do, the gallows is ready, and your
executioner, in spite of the most solemn promises, will turn you
off the next hour.</p>
<p>With every disposition to please (where to please within fair
and rational limits is a high duty), it is impossible for public
men to be long silent about the Catholics; pressing evils are not
got rid of, because they are not talked of.&nbsp; A man may
command his family to say nothing more about the stone and
surgical operations; but the ponderous malice still lies upon the
nerve, and gets so big, that the patient breaks his own law of
silence, clamours for the knife, and expires under its late
operation.&nbsp; Believe me, you talk folly when you talk of
suppressing the Catholic question.&nbsp; I wish to God the case
admitted of such a remedy; bad as it is, it does not admit of
it.&nbsp; If the wants of the Catholics are not heard in the
manly tones of Lord Grenville, or the servile drawl of Lord
Castlereagh, they will be heard ere long in the madness of mobs,
and the conflicts of armed men.</p>
<p>I observe it is now universally the fashion to speak of the
first personage in the state as the great obstacle to the
measure.&nbsp; In the first place, I am not bound to believe such
rumours because I hear them; and in the next place, I object to
such language, as unconstitutional.&nbsp; Whoever retains his
situation in the ministry while the incapacities of the Catholics
remain, is the advocate for those incapacities; and to him, and
to him only, am I to look for responsibility.&nbsp; But waive
this question of the Catholics, and put a general case:&mdash;How
is a minister of this country to act when the conscientious
scruples of his Sovereign prevent the execution of a measure
deemed by him absolutely necessary to the safety of the
country?&nbsp; His conduct is quite clear&mdash;he should
resign.&nbsp; But what is his successor to
do?&mdash;Resign.&nbsp; But is the King to be left without
ministers, and is he in this manner to be compelled to act
against his own conscience?&nbsp; Before I answer this, pray tell
me in my turn what better defence is there against the
machinations of a wicked, or the errors of a weak Monarch, than
the impossibility of finding a minister who will lend himself to
vice and folly?&nbsp; Every English Monarch, in such a
predicament, would sacrifice his opinions and views to such a
clear expression of the public will; and it is one method in
which the Constitution aims at bringing about such a
sacrifice.&nbsp; You may say, if you please, the ruler of a state
is forced to give up his object when the natural love of place
and power will tempt no one to assist him in its attainment; this
may be force; but it is force without injury, and therefore
without blame.&nbsp; I am not to be beat out of these obvious
reasonings, and ancient constitutional provisions, by the term
conscience.&nbsp; There is no fantasy, however wild, that a man
may not persuade himself that he cherishes from motives of
conscience; eternal war against impious France, or rebellious
America, or Catholic Spain, may in times to come be scruples of
conscience.&nbsp; One English Monarch may, from scruples of
conscience, wish to abolish every trait of religious persecution;
another Monarch may deem it his absolute and indispensable duty
to make a slight provision for Dissenters out of the revenues of
the Church of England.&nbsp; So that you see, Brother Abraham,
there are cases where it would be the duty of the best and most
loyal subjects to oppose the conscientious scruples of their
Sovereign, still taking care that their actions were
constitutional and their modes respectful.&nbsp; Then you come
upon me with personal questions, and say that no such dangers are
to be apprehended now under our present gracious Sovereign, of
whose good qualities we must be all so well convinced.&nbsp; All
these sorts of discussions I beg leave to decline.&nbsp; What I
have said upon constitutional topics, I mean of course for
general, not for particular application.&nbsp; I agree with you
in all the good you have said of the powers that be, and I avail
myself of the opportunity of pointing out general dangers to the
Constitution, at a moment when we are so completely exempted from
their present influence.&nbsp; I cannot finish this letter
without expressing my surprise and pleasure at your abuse of the
servile addresses poured in upon the throne, nor can I conceive a
greater disgust to a Monarch, with a true English heart, than to
see such a question as that of Catholic Emancipation argued, not
with a reference to its justice or importance, but universally
considered to be of no further consequence than as it affects his
own private feelings.&nbsp; That these sentiments should be mine
is not wonderful; but how they came to be yours does, I confess,
fill me with surprise.&nbsp; Are you moved by the arrival of the
Irish Brigade at Antwerp, and the amorous violence which awaits
Mrs. Plymley?</p>
<h3>LETTER V.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Abraham</span>,&mdash;I never met a
parson in my life who did not consider the Corporation and Test
Acts as the great bulwarks of the Church; and yet it is now just
sixty-four years since bills of indemnity to destroy their penal
effects, or, in other words, to repeal them, have been passed
annually as a matter of course.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Heu vatum ignar mentes</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These bulwarks, without which no clergyman thinks he could
sleep with his accustomed soundness, have actually not been in
existence since any man now living has taken holy orders.&nbsp;
Every year the Indemnity Act pardons past breaches of these two
laws, and prevents any fresh actions of informers from coming to
a conclusion before the period for the next indemnity bill
arrives; so that these penalties, by which alone the Church
remains in existence, have not had one moment&rsquo;s operation
for sixty-four years.&nbsp; You will say the legislature, during
the whole of this period, has reserved to itself the discretion
of suspending or not suspending.&nbsp; But had not the
legislature the right of re-enacting, if it was necessary?&nbsp;
And now when you have kept the rod over these people (with the
most scandalous abuse of all principle) for sixty-four years, and
not found it necessary to strike once, is not that the best of
all reasons why the rod should be laid aside?&nbsp; You talk to
me of a very valuable hedge running across your fields which you
would not part with on any account.&nbsp; I go down, expecting to
find a limit impervious to cattle, and highly useful for the
preservation of property; but, to my utter astonishment, I find
that the hedge was cut down half a century ago, and that every
year the shoots are clipped the moment they appear above ground:
it appears, upon further inquiry, that the hedge never ought to
have existed at all; that it originated in the malice of
antiquated quarrels, and was cut down because it subjected you to
vast inconvenience, and broke up your intercourse with a country
absolutely necessary to your existence.&nbsp; If the remains of
this hedge serve only to keep up an irritation in your
neighbours, and to remind them of the feuds of former times, good
nature and good sense teach you that you ought to grub it up, and
cast it into the oven.&nbsp; This is the exact state of these two
laws; and yet it is made a great argument against concession to
the Catholics, that it involves their repeal; which is to say, Do
not make me relinquish a folly that will lead to my ruin;
because, if you do, I must give up other follies ten times
greater than this.</p>
<p>I confess, with all our bulwarks and hedges, it mortifies me
to the quick to contrast with our matchless stupidity and
inimitable folly the conduct of Bonaparte upon the subject of
religious persecution.&nbsp; At the moment when we are tearing
the crucifixes from the necks of the Catholics, and washing pious
mud from the foreheads of the Hindoos; at that moment this man is
assembling the very Jews at Paris, and endeavouring to give them
stability and importance.&nbsp; I shall never be reconciled to
mending shoes in America; but I see it must be my lot, and I will
then take a dreadful revenge upon Mr. Perceval, if I catch him
preaching within ten miles of me.&nbsp; I cannot for the soul of
me conceive whence this man has gained his notions of
Christianity: he has the most evangelical charity for errors in
arithmetic, and the most inveterate malice against errors in
conscience.&nbsp; While he rages against those whom in the true
spirit of the Gospel he ought to indulge, he forgets the only
instance of severity which that Gospel contains, and leaves the
jobbers, contractors, and money-changers at their seats, without
a single stripe.</p>
<p>You cannot imagine, you say, that England will ever be ruined
and conquered; and for no other reason that I can find, but
because it seems so very odd it should be ruined and
conquered.&nbsp; Alas! so reasoned, in their time, the Austrian,
Russian, and Prussian Plymleys.&nbsp; But the English are brave:
so were all these nations.&nbsp; You might get together a hundred
thousand men individually brave; but without generals capable of
commanding such a machine, it would be as useless as a first-rate
man-of-war manned by Oxford clergymen or Parisian
shopkeepers.&nbsp; I do not say this to the disparagement of
English officers: they have had no means of acquiring experience;
but I do say it to create alarm; for we do not appear to me to be
half alarmed enough, or to entertain that sense of our danger
which leads to the most obvious means of self-defence.&nbsp; As
for the spirit of the peasantry in making a gallant defence
behind hedge-rows, and through plate-racks and hen-coops, highly
as I think of their bravery, I do not know any nation in Europe
so likely to be struck with the panic as the English; and this
from their total unacquaintance with the science of war.&nbsp;
Old wheat and beans blazing for twenty miles round; cart mares
shot; sows of Lord Somerville&rsquo;s breed running wild over the
country; the minister of the parish wounded sorely in his hinder
parts; Mrs. Plymley in fits.&nbsp; All these scenes of war an
Austrian or a Russian has seen three or four times over: but it
is now three centuries since an English pig has fallen in a fair
battle upon English ground, or a farm-house been rifled, or a
clergyman&rsquo;s wife been subjected to any other proposals of
love than the connubial endearments of her sleek and orthodox
mate.&nbsp; The old edition of Plutarch&rsquo;s Lives, which lies
in the corner of your parlour window, has contributed to work you
up to the most romantic expectations of our Roman
behaviour.&nbsp; You are persuaded that Lord Amherst will defend
Kew Bridge like Cocles; that some maid of honour will break away
from her captivity, and swim over the Thames; that the Duke of
York will burn his capitulating hand; and little Mr. Sturges
Bourne give forty years&rsquo; purchase for Moulsham Hall, while
the French are encamped upon it.&nbsp; I hope we shall witness
all this, if the French do come; but in the meantime I am so
enchanted with the ordinary English behaviour of these invaluable
persons, that I earnestly pray no opportunity may be given them
for Roman valour, and for those very un-Roman pensions which they
would all, of course, take especial care to claim in
consequence.&nbsp; But whatever was our conduct, if every
ploughman was as great a hero as he who was called from his oxen
to save Rome from her enemies, I should still say, that at such a
crisis you want the affections of all your subjects in both
islands: there is no spirit which you must alienate, no art you
must avert, every man must feel he has a country, and that there
is an urgent and pressing cause why he should expose himself to
death.</p>
<p>The effects of penal laws in matters of religion are never
confined to those limits in which the legislature intended they
should be placed: it is not only that I am excluded from certain
offices and dignities because I am a Catholic, but the exclusion
carries with it a certain stigma, which degrades me in the eyes
of the monopolising sect, and the very name of my religion
becomes odious.&nbsp; These effects are so very striking in
England, that I solemnly believe blue and red baboons to be more
popular here than Catholics and Presbyterians; they are more
understood, and there is a greater disposition to do something
for them.&nbsp; When a country squire hears of an ape, his first
feeling is to give it nuts and apples; when he hears of a
Dissenter, his immediate impulse is to commit it to the county
gaol, to shave its head, to alter its customary food, and to have
it privately whipped.&nbsp; This is no caricature, but an
accurate picture of national feelings, as they degrade and
endanger us at this very moment.&nbsp; The Irish Catholic
gentleman would bear his legal disabilities with greater temper,
if these were all he had to bear&mdash;if they did not enable
every Protestant cheese-monger and tide-waiter to treat him with
contempt.&nbsp; He is branded on the forehead with a red-hot
iron, and treated like a spiritual felon, because in the highest
of all considerations he is led by the noblest of all guides, his
own disinterested conscience.</p>
<p>Why are nonsense and cruelty a bit the better because they are
enacted?&nbsp; If Providence, which gives wine and oil, had
blessed us with that tolerant spirit which makes the countenance
more pleasant and the heart more glad than these can do; if our
Statute Book had never been defiled with such infamous laws, the
sepulchral Spencer Perceval would have been hauled through the
dirtiest horse-pond in Hampstead, had he ventured to propose
them.&nbsp; But now persecution is good, because it exists; every
law which originated in ignorance and malice, and gratifies the
passions from whence it sprang, we call the wisdom of our
ancestors: when such laws are repealed, they will be cruelty and
madness; till they are repealed, they are policy and caution.</p>
<p>I was somewhat amused with the imputation brought against the
Catholics by the University of Oxford, that they are enemies to
liberty.&nbsp; I immediately turned to my &ldquo;History of
England,&rdquo; and marked as an historical error that passage in
which it is recorded that, in the reign of Queen Anne, the famous
degree of the University of Oxford respecting passive obedience,
was ordered by the House of Lords to be burnt by the hands of the
common hangman, as contrary to the liberty of the subject and the
law of the land.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I wish, whatever be the
modesty of those who impute, that the imputation was a little
more true, the Catholic cause would not be quite so desperate
with the present.&nbsp; Administration.&nbsp; I fear, however,
that the hatred to liberty in these poor devoted wretches may ere
long appear more doubtful than it is at present to the
Vice-Chancellor and his Clergy, inflamed as they doubtless are
with classical examples of republican virtue, and panting, as
they always have been, to reduce the power of the Crown within
narrower and safer limits.&nbsp; What mistaken zeal to attempt to
connect one religion with freedom and another with slavery!&nbsp;
Who laid the foundations of English liberty?&nbsp; What was the
mixed religion of Switzerland?&nbsp; What has the Protestant
religion done for liberty in Denmark, in Sweden, throughout the
north of Germany, and in Prussia?&nbsp; The purest religion in
the world, in my humble opinion, is the religion of the Church of
England: for its preservation (so far as it is exercised without
intruding upon the liberties of others) I am ready at this moment
to venture my present life, and but through that religion I have
no hopes of any other; yet I am not forced to be silly because I
am pious; nor will I ever join in eulogiums on my faith which
every man of common reading and common sense can so easily
refute.</p>
<p>You have either done too much for the Catholics, worthy
Abraham, or too little; if you had intended to refuse them
political power, you should have refused them civil rights.&nbsp;
After you had enabled them to acquire property, after you had
conceded to them all that you did concede in &rsquo;78 and
&rsquo;93, the rest is wholly out of your power: you may choose
whether you will give the rest in an honourable or a disgraceful
mode, but it is utterly out of your power to withhold it.</p>
<p>In the last year, land to the amount of <i>eight hundred
thousand pounds</i> was purchased by the Catholics in
Ireland.&nbsp; Do you think it possible to be-Perceval, and
be-Canning, and be-Castlereagh, such a body of men as this out of
their common rights, and their common sense?&nbsp; Mr. George
Canning may laugh and joke at the idea of Protestant bailiffs
ravishing Catholic ladies, under the 9th clause of the Sunset
Bill; but if some better remedy be not applied to the
distractions of Ireland than the jocularity of Mr. Canning, they
will soon put an end to his pension, and to the pension of those
&ldquo;near and dear relatives,&rdquo; for whose eating,
drinking, washing, and clothing, every man in the United Kingdoms
now pays his two-pence or three-pence a year.&nbsp; You may call
these observations coarse, if you please; but I have no idea that
the Sophias and Carolines of any man breathing are to eat
national veal, to drink public tea, to wear Treasury ribands, and
then that we are to be told that it is coarse to animadvert upon
this pitiful and eleemosynary splendour.&nbsp; If this is right,
why not mention it?&nbsp; If it is wrong, why should not he who
enjoys the ease of supporting his sisters in this manner bear the
shame of it?&nbsp; Everybody seems hitherto to have spared a man
who never spares anybody.</p>
<p>As for the enormous wax candles, and superstitious mummeries,
and painted jackets of the Catholic priests, I fear them
not.&nbsp; Tell me that the world will return again under the
influence of the smallpox; that Lord Castlereagh will hereafter
oppose the power of the Court; that Lord Howick and Mr. Grattan
will do each of them a mean and dishonourable action; that
anybody who has heard Lord Redesdale speak once will knowingly
and willingly hear him again; that Lord Eldon has assented to the
fact of two and two making four, without shedding tears, or
expressing the smallest doubt or scruple; tell me any other thing
absurd or incredible, but, for the love of common sense, let me
hear no more of the danger to be apprehended from the general
diffusion of Popery.&nbsp; It is too absurd to be reasoned upon;
every man feels it is nonsense when he hears it stated, and so
does every man while he is stating it.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine why the friends to the Church Establishment
should enter in such a horror of seeing the doors of Parliament
flung open to the Catholics, and view so passively the enjoyment
of that right by the Presbyterians and by every other species of
Dissenter.&nbsp; In their tenets, in their Church Government, in
the nature of their endowments, the Dissenters are infinitely
more distant from the Church of England than the Catholics are;
yet the Dissenters have never been excluded from
Parliament.&nbsp; There are 45 members in one House, and 16 in
the other, who always are Dissenters.&nbsp; There is no law which
would prevent every member of the Lords and Commons from being
Dissenters.&nbsp; The Catholics could not bring into Parliament
half the number of the Scotch members; and yet one exclusion is
of such immense importance, because it has taken place; and the
other no human being thinks of, because no one is accustomed to
it.&nbsp; I have often thought, if the <i>wisdom of our
ancestors</i> had excluded all persons with red hair from the
House of Commons, of the throes and convulsions it would occasion
to restore them to their natural rights.&nbsp; What mobs and
riots would it produce!&nbsp; To what infinite abuse and obloquy
would the capillary patriot be exposed; what wormwood would
distil from Mr. Perceval, what froth would drop from Mr. Canning;
how (I will not say <i>my</i>, but <i>our</i> Lord Hawkesbury,
for he belongs to us all)&mdash;how our Lord Hawkesbury would
work away about the hair of King William and Lord Somers, and the
authors of the great and glorious Revolution; how Lord Eldon
would appeal to the Deity and his own virtues, and to the hair of
his children: some would say that red-haired men were
superstitious; some would prove they were atheists; they would be
petitioned against as the friends of slavery, and the advocates
for revolt; in short, such a corruptor of the heart and
understanding is the spirit of persecution, that these
unfortunate people (conspired against by their fellow-subjects of
every complexion), if they did not emigrate to countries where
hair of another colour was persecuted, would be driven to the
falsehood of perukes, or the hypocrisy of the Tricosian
fluid.</p>
<p>As for the dangers of the Church (in spite of the staggering
events which have lately taken place), I have not yet entirely
lost my confidence in the power of common sense, and I believe
the Church to be in no danger at all; but if it is, that danger
is not from the Catholics, but from the Methodists, and from that
patent Christianity which has been for some time manufacturing at
Clapham, to the prejudice of the old and admirable article
prepared by the Church.&nbsp; I would counsel my lords the
Bishops to keep their eyes upon that holy village, and its
vicinity; they will find there a zeal in making converts far
superior to anything which exists among the Catholics; a contempt
for the great mass of English clergy, much more rooted and
profound; and a regular fund to purchase livings for those
groaning and garrulous gentlemen whom they denominate (by a
standing sarcasm against the regular Church) Gospel preachers and
vital clergymen.&nbsp; I am too firm a believer in the general
propriety and respectability of the English clergy, to believe
they have much to fear either from old nonsense or from new; but
if the Church must be supposed to be in danger, I prefer that
nonsense which is grown half venerable from time, the force of
which I have already tried and baffled, which at least has some
excuse in the dark and ignorant ages in which it
originated.&nbsp; The religious enthusiasm manufactured by living
men before my own eyes disgusts my understanding as much,
influences my imagination not at all, and excites my
apprehensions much more.</p>
<p>I may have seemed to you to treat the situation of public
affairs with some degree of levity; but I feel it deeply, and
with nightly and daily anguish; because I know Ireland; I have
known it all my life; I love it, and I foresee the crisis to
which it will soon be exposed.&nbsp; Who can doubt but that
Ireland will experience ultimately from France a treatment to
which the conduct they have experienced from England is the love
of a parent, or a brother?&nbsp; Who can doubt but that five
years after he has got hold of the country, Ireland will be
tossed away by Bonaparte as a present to some one of his ruffian
generals, who will knock the head of Mr. Keogh against the head
of Cardinal Troy, shoot twenty of the most noisy blockheads of
the Roman persuasion, wash his pug-dogs in holy water, and
confiscate the salt butter of the Milesian republic to the last
tub?&nbsp; But what matters this? or who is wise enough in
Ireland to heed it? or when had common sense much influence with
my poor dear Irish?&nbsp; Mr. Perceval does not know the Irish;
but I know them, and I know that at every rash and mad hazard
they will break the Union, revenge their wounded pride and their
insulted religion, and fling themselves into the open arms of
France, sure of dying in the embrace.&nbsp; And now, what means
have you of guarding against this coming evil, upon which the
future happiness or misery of every Englishman depends?&nbsp;
Have you a single ally in the whole world?&nbsp; Is there a
vulnerable point in the French empire where the astonishing
resources of that people can be attracted and employed?&nbsp;
Have you a ministry wise enough to comprehend the danger, manly
enough to believe unpleasant intelligence, honest enough to state
their apprehensions at the peril of their places?&nbsp; Is there
anywhere the slightest disposition to join any measure of love,
or conciliation, or hope, with that dreadful bill which the
distractions of Ireland have rendered necessary?&nbsp; At the
very moment that the last Monarchy in Europe has fallen, are we
not governed by a man of pleasantry, and a man of theology?&nbsp;
In the six hundredth year of our empire over Ireland, have we any
memorial of ancient kindness to refer to? any people, any zeal,
any country on which we can depend?&nbsp; Have we any hope, but
in the winds of heaven and the tides of the sea? any prayer to
prefer to the Irish, but that they should forget and forgive
their oppressors, who, in the very moment that they are calling
upon them for their exertions, solemnly assure them that the
oppression shall still remain?</p>
<p>Abraham, farewell!&nbsp; If I have tired you, remember how
often you have tired me and others.&nbsp; I do not think we
really differ in politics so much as you suppose; or at least, if
we do, that difference is in the means, and not in the end.&nbsp;
We both love the Constitution, respect the King, and abhor the
French.&nbsp; But though you love the Constitution, you would
perpetuate the abuses which have been engrafted upon it; though
you respect the King, you would confirm his scruples against the
Catholics; though you abhor the French, you would open to them
the conquest of Ireland.&nbsp; My method of respecting my
sovereign is by protecting his honour, his empire, and his
lasting happiness; I evince my love of the Constitution by making
it the guardian of all men&rsquo;s rights and the source of their
freedom; and I prove my abhorrence of the French, by uniting
against them the disciples of every church in the only remaining
nation in Europe.&nbsp; As for the men of whom I have been
compelled in this age of mediocrity to say so much, they cannot
of themselves be worth a moment&rsquo;s consideration, to you, to
me, or to anybody.&nbsp; In a year after their death they will be
forgotten as completely as if they had never been; and are now of
no further importance than as they are the mere vehicles of
carrying into effect the common-place and mischievous prejudices
of the times in which they live.</p>
<h3>LETTER VI.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Abraham</span>,&mdash;What amuses me
the most is to hear of the <i>indulgences</i> which the Catholics
have received, and their exorbitance in not being satisfied with
those indulgences: now if you complain to me that a man is
obtrusive and shameless in his requests, and that it is
impossible to bring him to reason, I must first of all hear the
whole of your conduct towards him; for you may have taken from
him so much in the first instance that, in spite of a long series
of restitution, a vast latitude for petition may still remain
behind.</p>
<p>There is a village, no matter where, in which the inhabitants,
on one day in the year, sit down to a dinner prepared at the
common expense: by an extraordinary piece of tyranny, which Lord
Hawkesbury would call the wisdom of the village ancestors, the
inhabitants of three of the streets, about a hundred years ago,
seized upon the inhabitants of the fourth street, bound them hand
and foot, laid them upon their backs, and compelled them to look
on while the rest were stuffing themselves with beef and beer;
the next year the inhabitants of the persecuted street, though
they contributed an equal quota of the expense, were treated
precisely in the same manner.&nbsp; The tyranny grew into a
custom; and, as the manner of our nature is, it was considered as
the most sacred of all duties to keep these poor fellows without
their annual dinner.&nbsp; The village was so tenacious of this
practice, that nothing could induce them to resign it; every
enemy to it was looked upon as a disbeliever in Divine
Providence, and any nefarious churchwarden who wished to succeed
in his election had nothing to do but to represent his antagonist
as an abolitionist, in order to frustrate his ambition, endanger
his life, and throw the village into a state of the most dreadful
commotion.&nbsp; By degrees, however, the obnoxious street grew
to be so well peopled, and its inhabitants so firmly united, that
their oppressors, more afraid of injustice, were more disposed to
be just.&nbsp; At the next dinner they are unbound, the year
after allowed to sit upright, then a bit of bread and a glass of
water; till at last, after a long series of concessions, they are
emboldened to ask, in pretty plain terms, that they may be
allowed to sit down at the bottom of the table, and to fill their
bellies as well as the rest.&nbsp; Forthwith a general cry of
shame and scandal: &ldquo;Ten years ago, were you not laid upon
your backs?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember what a great thing you
thought it to get a piece of bread?&nbsp; How thankful you were
for cheese parings?&nbsp; Have you forgotten that memorable era,
when the lord of the manor interfered to obtain for you a slice
of the public pudding?&nbsp; And now, with an audacity only
equalled by your ingratitude, you have the impudence to ask for
knives and forks, and to request, in terms too plain to be
mistaken, that you may sit down to table with the rest, and be
indulged even with beef and beer: there are not more than half a
dozen dishes which we have reserved for ourselves; the rest has
been thrown open to you in the utmost profusion; you have
potatoes, and carrots, suet dumplings, sops in the pan, and
delicious toast and water in incredible quantities.&nbsp; Beef,
mutton, lamb, pork, and veal are ours; and if you were not the
most restless and dissatisfied of human beings, you would never
think of aspiring to enjoy them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is not this, my dainty Abraham, the very nonsense and the very
insult which is talked to and practised upon the Catholics?&nbsp;
You are surprised that men who have tasted of partial justice
should ask for perfect justice; that he who has been robbed of
coat and cloak will not be contented with the restitution of one
of his garments.&nbsp; He would be a very lazy blockhead if he
were content, and I (who, though an inhabitant of the village,
have preserved, thank God, some sense of justice) most earnestly
counsel these half-fed claimants to persevere in their just
demands, till they are admitted to a more complete share of a
dinner for which they pay as much as the others; and if they see
a little attenuated lawyer squabbling at the head of their
opponents, let them desire him to empty his pockets, and to pull
out all the pieces of duck, fowl, and pudding which he has
filched from the public feast, to carry home to his wife and
children.</p>
<p>You parade a great deal upon the vast concessions made by this
country to the Irish before the Union.&nbsp; I deny that any
voluntary concession was ever made by England to Ireland.&nbsp;
What did Ireland ever ask that was granted?&nbsp; What did she
ever demand that was not refused?&nbsp; How did she get her
Mutiny Bill&mdash;a limited Parliament&mdash;a repeal of
Poyning&rsquo;s Law&mdash;a constitution?&nbsp; Not by the
concessions of England, but by her fears.&nbsp; When Ireland
asked for all these things upon her knees, her petitions were
rejected with Percevalism and contempt; when she demanded them
with the voice of 60,000 armed men, they were granted with every
mark of consternation and dismay.&nbsp; Ask of Lord Auckland the
fatal consequences of trifling with such a people as the
Irish.&nbsp; He himself was the organ of these refusals.&nbsp; As
secretary to the Lord Lieutenant, the insolence and the tyranny
of this country passed through his hands.&nbsp; Ask him if he
remembers the consequences.&nbsp; Ask him if he has forgotten
that memorable evening when he came down booted and mantled to
the House of Commons, when he told the House he was about to set
off for Ireland that night, and declared before God, if he did
not carry with him a compliance with all their demands, Ireland
was for ever lost to this country.&nbsp; The present generation
have forgotten this; but I have not forgotten it; and I know,
hasty and undignified as the submission of England then was, that
Lord Auckland was right, that the delay of a single day might
very probably have separated the two peoples for ever.&nbsp; The
terms submission and fear are galling terms when applied from the
lesser nation to the greater; but it is the plain historical
truth, it is the natural consequence of injustice, it is the
predicament in which every country places itself which leaves
such a mass of hatred and discontent by its side.&nbsp; No empire
is powerful enough to endure it; it would exhaust the strength of
China, and sink it with all its mandarins and tea-kettles to the
bottom of the deep.&nbsp; By refusing them justice now when you
are strong enough to refuse them anything more than justice, you
will act over again, with the Catholics, the same scene of mean
and precipitate submission which disgraced you before America,
and before the volunteers of Ireland.&nbsp; We shall live to hear
the Hampstead Protestant pronouncing such extravagant panegyrics
upon holy water, and paying such fulsome compliments to the
thumbs and offals of departed saints, that parties will change
sentiments, and Lord Henry Petty and Sam Whitbread take a spell
at No Popery.&nbsp; The wisdom of Mr. Fox was alike employed in
teaching his country justice when Ireland was weak, and dignity
when Ireland was strong.&nbsp; We are fast pacing round the same
miserable circle of ruin and imbecility.&nbsp; Alas! where is our
guide?</p>
<p>You say that Ireland is a millstone about our necks; that it
would be better for us if Ireland were sunk at the bottom of the
sea; that the Irish are a nation of irreclaimable savages and
barbarians.&nbsp; How often have I heard these sentiments fall
from the plump and thoughtless squire, and from the thriving
English shopkeeper, who has never felt the rod of an Orange
master upon his back.&nbsp; Ireland a millstone about your
neck!&nbsp; Why is it not a stone of Ajax in your hand?&nbsp; I
agree with you most cordially that, governed as Ireland now is,
it would be a vast accession of strength if the waves of the sea
were to rise and engulf her to-morrow.&nbsp; At this moment,
opposed as we are to all the world, the annihilation of one of
the most fertile islands on the face of the globe, containing
five millions of human creatures, would be one of the most solid
advantages which could happen to this country.&nbsp; I doubt very
much, in spite of all the just abuse which has been lavished upon
Bonaparte, whether there is any one of his conquered countries
the blotting out of which would be as beneficial to him as the
destruction of Ireland would be to us: of countries I speak
differing in language from the French, little habituated to their
intercourse, and inflamed with all the resentments of a
recently-conquered people.&nbsp; Why will you attribute the
turbulence of our people to any cause but the right&mdash;to any
cause but your own scandalous oppression?&nbsp; If you tie your
horse up to a gate, and beat him cruelly, is he vicious because
he kicks you?&nbsp; If you have plagued and worried a mastiff dog
for years, is he mad because he flies at you whenever he sees
you?&nbsp; Hatred is an active, troublesome passion.&nbsp; Depend
upon it, whole nations have always some reason for their
hatred.&nbsp; Before you refer the turbulence of the Irish to
incurable defects in their character, tell me if you have treated
them as friends and equals?&nbsp; Have you protected their
commerce?&nbsp; Have you respected their religion?&nbsp; Have you
been as anxious for their freedom as your own?&nbsp; Nothing of
all this.&nbsp; What then?&nbsp; Why you have confiscated the
territorial surface of the country twice over: you have massacred
and exported her inhabitants: you have deprived four-fifths of
them of every civil privilege: you have at every period made her
commerce and manufactures slavishly subordinate to your own: and
yet the hatred which the Irish bear to you is the result of an
original turbulence of character, and of a primitive, obdurate
wildness, utterly incapable of civilisation.&nbsp; The
embroidered inanities and the sixth-form effusions of Mr. Canning
are really not powerful enough to make me believe this; nor is
there any authority on earth (always excepting the Dean of Christ
Church) which could make it credible to me.&nbsp; I am sick of
Mr. Canning.&nbsp; There is not a &ldquo;ha&rsquo;porth of bread
to all this sugar and sack.&rdquo;&nbsp; I love not the
cretaceous and incredible countenance of his colleague.&nbsp; The
only opinion in which I agree with these two gentlemen is that
which they entertain of each other.&nbsp; I am sure that the
insolence of Mr. Pitt, and the unbalanced accounts of Melville,
were far better than the perils of this new ignorance:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Nonne fuit sati&ugrave;s, ristes Amaryllidis
iras<br />
Atque superba pati fastidia? nonne Menalcan?<br />
Quamvis ille <i>niger</i>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the midst of the most profound peace, the secret articles
of the Treaty of Tilsit, in which the destruction of Ireland is
resolved upon, induce you to rob the Danes of their fleet.&nbsp;
After the expedition sailed comes the Treaty of Tilsit,
containing no article, public or private, alluding to
Ireland.&nbsp; The state of the world, you tell me, justified us
in doing this.&nbsp; Just God! do we think only of the state of
the world when there is an opportunity for robbery, for murder,
and for plunder; and do we forget the state of the world when we
are called upon to be wise, and good, and just?&nbsp; Does the
state of the world never remind us that we have four millions of
subjects whose injuries we ought to atone for, and whose
affections we ought to conciliate?&nbsp; Does the state of the
world never warn us to lay aside our infernal bigotry, and to arm
every man who acknowledges a God, and can grasp a sword?&nbsp;
Did it never occur to this administration that they might
virtuously get hold of a force ten times greater than the force
of the Danish fleet?&nbsp; Was there no other way of protecting
Ireland but by bringing eternal shame upon Great Britain, and by
making the earth a den of robbers?&nbsp; See what the men whom
you have supplanted would have done.&nbsp; They would have
rendered the invasion of Ireland impossible, by restoring to the
Catholics their long-lost rights: they would have acted in such a
manner that the French would neither have wished for invasion nor
dared to attempt it: they would have increased the permanent
strength of the country while they preserved its reputation
unsullied.&nbsp; Nothing of this kind your friends have done,
because they are solemnly pledged to do nothing of this kind;
because, to tolerate all religions, and to equalise civil rights
to all sects, is to oppose some of the worst passions of our
nature&mdash;to plunder and to oppress is to gratify them
all.&nbsp; They wanted the huzzas of mobs, and they have for ever
blasted the fame of England to obtain them.&nbsp; Were the fleets
of Holland, France, and Spain destroyed by larceny?&nbsp; You
resisted the power of 150 sail of the line by sheer courage, and
violated every principle of morals from the dread of fifteen
hulks, while the expedition itself cost you three times more than
the value of the larcenous matter brought away.&nbsp; The French
trample on the laws of God and man, not for old cordage, but for
kingdoms, and always take care to be well paid for their
crimes.&nbsp; We contrive, under the present administration, to
unite moral with intellectual deficiency, and to grow weaker and
worse by the same action.&nbsp; If they had any evidence of the
intended hostility of the Danes, why was it not produced?&nbsp;
Why have the nations of Europe been allowed to feel an
indignation against this country beyond the reach of all
subsequent information?&nbsp; Are these times, do you imagine,
when we can trifle with a year of universal hatred, dally with
the curses of Europe, and then regain a lost character at
pleasure, by the parliamentary perspirations of the Foreign
Secretary, or the solemn asseverations of the pecuniary
Rose?&nbsp; Believe me, Abraham, it is not under such ministers
as these that the dexterity of honest Englishmen will ever equal
the dexterity of French knaves; it is not in their presence that
the serpent of Moses will ever swallow up the serpents of the
magician.</p>
<p>Lord Hawkesbury says that nothing is to be granted to the
Catholics from fear.&nbsp; What! not even justice?&nbsp; Why
not?&nbsp; There are four millions of disaffected people within
twenty miles of your own coast.&nbsp; I fairly confess that the
dread which I have of their physical power is with me a very
strong motive for listening to their claims.&nbsp; To talk of not
acting from fear, is mere parliamentary cant.&nbsp; From what
motive but fear, I should be glad to know, have all the
improvements in our constitution proceeded?&nbsp; I question if
any justice has ever been done to large masses of mankind from
any other motive.&nbsp; By what other motives can the plunderers
of the Baltic suppose nations to be governed in their intercourse
<i>with each other</i>?&nbsp; If I say, Give this people what
they ask because it is just, do you think I should get ten people
to listen to me?&nbsp; Would not the lesser of the two Jenkinsons
be the first to treat me with contempt?&nbsp; The only true way
to make the mass of mankind see the beauty of justice is by
showing to them, in pretty plain terms, the consequences of
injustice.&nbsp; If any body of French troops land in Ireland,
the whole population of that country will rise against you to a
man, and you could not possibly survive such an event three
years.&nbsp; Such, from the bottom of my soul, do I believe to be
the present state of that country; and so far does it appear to
me to be impolitic and unstatesman-like to concede anything to
such a danger, that if the Catholics, in addition to their
present just demands, were to petition for the perpetual removal
of the said Lord Hawkesbury from his Majesty&rsquo;s councils, I
think, whatever might be the effect upon the destinies of Europe,
and however it might retard our own individual destruction, that
the prayer of the petition should be instantly complied
with.&nbsp; Canning&rsquo;s crocodile tears should not move me;
the hoops of the maids of honour should not hide him.&nbsp; I
would tear him from the banisters of the back stairs, and plunge
him in the fishy fumes of the dirtiest of all his Cinque
Ports.</p>
<h3>LETTER VII.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Abraham</span>,&mdash;In the
correspondence which is passing between us, you are perpetually
alluding to the Foreign Secretary; and in answer to the dangers
of Ireland, which I am pressing upon your notice, you have
nothing to urge but the confidence which you repose in the
discretion and sound sense of this gentleman.&nbsp; I can only
say, that I have listened to him long and often with the greatest
attention; I have used every exertion in my power to take a fair
measure of him, and it appears to me impossible to hear him upon
any arduous topic without perceiving that he is eminently
deficient in those solid and serious qualities upon which, and
upon which alone, the confidence of a great country can properly
repose.&nbsp; He sweats and labours, and works for sense, and Mr.
Ellis seems always to think it is coming, but it does not come;
the machine can&rsquo;t draw up what is not to be found in the
spring; Providence has made him a light, jesting,
paragraph-writing man, and that he will remain to his dying
day.&nbsp; When he is jocular he is strong, when he is serious he
is like Samson in a wig; any ordinary person is a match for him:
a song, an ironical letter, a burlesque ode, an attack in the
newspaper upon Nicoll&rsquo;s eye, a smart speech of twenty
minutes, full of gross misrepresentations and clever turns,
excellent language, a spirited manner, lucky quotation, success
in provoking dull men, some half information picked up in Pall
Mall in the morning; these are your friend&rsquo;s natural
weapons; all these things he can do: here I allow him to be truly
great; nay, I will be just, and go still further, if he would
confine himself to these things, and consider the <i>facete</i>
and the playful to be the basis of his character, he would, for
that species of man, be universally regarded as a person of a
very good understanding; call him a legislator, a reasoner, and
the conductor of the affairs of a great nation, and it seems to
me as absurd as if a butterfly were to teach bees to make
honey.&nbsp; That he is an extraordinary writer of small poetry,
and a diner out of the highest lustre, I do most readily
admit.&nbsp; After George Selwyn, and perhaps Tickell, there has
been no such man for this half-century.&nbsp; The Foreign
Secretary is a gentleman, a respectable as well as a highly
agreeable man in private life; but you may as well feed me with
decayed potatoes as console me for the miseries of Ireland by the
resources of his <i>sense</i> and his <i>discretion</i>.&nbsp; It
is only the public situation which this gentleman holds which
entitles me or induces me to say so much about him.&nbsp; He is a
fly in amber, nobody cares about the fly; the only question is,
How the devil did it get there?&nbsp; Nor do I attack him for the
love of glory, but from the love of utility, as a burgomaster
hunts a rat in a Dutch dyke, for fear it should flood a
province.</p>
<p>The friends of the Catholic question are, I observe, extremely
embarrassed in arguing when they come to the loyalty of the Irish
Catholics.&nbsp; As for me, I shall go straight forward to my
object, and state what I have no manner of doubt, from an
intimate knowledge of Ireland, to be the plain truth.&nbsp; Of
the great Roman Catholic proprietors, and of the Catholic
prelates, there may be a few, and but a few, who would follow the
fortunes of England at all events: there is another set of men
who, thoroughly detesting this country, have too much property
and too much character to lose, not to wait for some very
favourable event before they show themselves; but the great mass
of Catholic population, upon the slightest appearance of a French
force in that country, would rise upon you to a man.&nbsp; It is
the most mistaken policy to conceal the plain truth.&nbsp; There
is no loyalty among the Catholics: they detest you as their worst
oppressors, and they will continue to detest you till you remove
the cause of their hatred.&nbsp; It is in your power in six
months&rsquo; time to produce a total revolution of opinions
among this people; and in some future letter I will show you that
this is clearly the case.&nbsp; At present, see what a dreadful
in state Ireland is in.&nbsp; The common toast among the low
Irish is, the feast of the <i>passover</i>.&nbsp; Some allusion
to <i>Bonaparte</i>, in a play lately acted at Dublin, produced
thunders of applause from the pit and the galleries; and a
politician should not be inattentive to the public feelings
expressed in theatres.&nbsp; Mr. Perceval thinks he has disarmed
the Irish: he has no more disarmed the Irish than he has resigned
a shilling of his own public emoluments.&nbsp; An Irish peasant
fills the barrel of his gun full of tow dipped in oil, butters up
the lock, buries it in a bog, and allows the Orange bloodhound to
ransack his cottage at pleasure.&nbsp; Be just and kind to the
Irish, and you will indeed disarm them; rescue them from the
degraded servitude in which they are held by a handful of their
own countrymen, and you will add four millions of brave and
affectionate men to your strength.&nbsp; Nightly visits,
Protestant inspectors, licenses to possess a pistol, or a knife
and fork, the odious vigour of the <i>evangelical</i>
Perceval&mdash;acts of Parliament, drawn up by some English
attorney, to save you from the hatred of four millions of
people&mdash;the guarding yourselves from universal disaffection
by a police; a confidence in the little cunning of Bow Street,
when you might rest your security upon the eternal basis of the
best feelings: this is the meanness and madness to which nations
are reduced when they lose sight of the first elements of
justice, without which a country can be no more secure than it
can be healthy without air.&nbsp; I sicken at such policy and
such men.&nbsp; The fact is, the Ministers know nothing about the
present state of Ireland; Mr. Perceval sees a few clergymen, Lord
Castlereagh a few general officers, who take care, of course, to
report what is pleasant rather than what is true.&nbsp; As for
the joyous and lepid consul, he jokes upon neutral flags and
frauds, jokes upon Irish rebels, jokes upon northern and western
and southern foes, and gives himself no trouble upon any subject;
nor is the mediocrity of the idolatrous deputy of the slightest
use.&nbsp; Dissolved in grins, he reads no memorials upon the
state of Ireland, listens to no reports, asks no questions, and
is the</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Bourn</i> from whom no traveller
returns.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The danger of an immediate insurrection is now, I
<i>believe</i>, blown over.&nbsp; You have so strong an army in
Ireland, and the Irish are become so much more cunning from the
last insurrection, that you may perhaps be tolerably secure just
at present from that evil: but are you secure from the efforts
which the French may make to throw a body of troops into Ireland?
and do you consider that event to be difficult and
improbable?&nbsp; From Brest Harbour to Cape St. Vincent, you
have above three thousand miles of hostile sea coast, and twelve
or fourteen harbours quite capable of containing a sufficient
force for the powerful invasion of Ireland.&nbsp; The nearest of
these harbours is not two days&rsquo; sail from the southern
coast of Ireland, with a fair leading wind; and the furthest not
ten.&nbsp; Five ships of the line, for so very short a passage,
might carry five or six thousand troops with cannon and
ammunition; and Ireland presents to their attack a southern coast
of more than 500 miles, abounding in deep bays, admirable
harbours, and disaffected inhabitants.&nbsp; Your blockading
ships may be forced to come home for provisions and repairs, or
they may be blown off in a gale of wind and compelled to bear
away for their own coast; and you will observe that the very same
wind which locks you up in the British Channel, when you are got
there, is evidently favourable for the invasion of Ireland.&nbsp;
And yet this is called Government, and the people huzza Mr.
Perceval for continuing to expose his country day after day to
such tremendous perils as these; cursing the men who would have
given up a question in theology to have saved us from such a
risk.&nbsp; The British empire at this moment is in the state of
a peach-blossom&mdash;if the wind blows gently from one quarter,
it survives; if furiously from the other, it perishes.&nbsp; A
stiff breeze may set in from the north, the Rochefort squadron
will be taken, and the Minister will be the most holy of men: if
it comes from some other point, Ireland is gone; we curse
ourselves as a set of monastic madmen, and call out for the
unavailing satisfaction of Mr. Perceval&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; Such
a state of political existence is scarcely credible: it is the
action of a mad young fool standing upon one foot, and peeping
down the crater of Mount &AElig;tna, not the conduct of a wise
and sober people deciding upon their best and dearest interests:
and in the name, the much-injured name, of heaven, what is it all
for that we expose ourselves to these dangers?&nbsp; Is it that
we may sell more muslin?&nbsp; Is it that we may acquire more
territory?&nbsp; Is it that we may strengthen what we have
already acquired?&nbsp; No; nothing of all this; but that one set
of Irishmen may torture another set of Irishmen&mdash;that Sir
Phelim O&rsquo;Callaghan may continue to whip Sir Toby
M&rsquo;Tackle, his next door neighbour, and continue to ravish
his Catholic daughters; and these are the measures which the
honest and consistent Secretary supports; and this is the
Secretary whose genius in the estimation of Brother Abraham is to
extinguish the genius of Bonaparte.&nbsp; Pompey was killed by a
slave, Goliath smitten by a stripling, Pyrrhus died by the hand
of a woman; tremble, thou great Gaul, from whose head an armed
Minerva leaps forth in the hour of danger; tremble, thou scourge
of God, a pleasant man is come out against thee, and thou shalt
be laid low by a joker of jokes, and he shall talk his pleasant
talk against thee, and thou shalt be no more!</p>
<p>You tell me, in spite of all this parade of sea-coast,
Bonaparte has neither ships nor sailors: but this is a
mistake.&nbsp; He has not ships and sailors to contest the empire
of the seas with Great Britain, but there remains quite
sufficient of the navies of France, Spain, Holland, and Denmark,
for these short excursions and invasions.&nbsp; Do you think,
too, that Bonaparte does not add to his navy every year?&nbsp; Do
you suppose, with all Europe at his feet, that he can find any
difficulty in obtaining timber, and that money will not procure
for him any quantity of naval stores he may want?&nbsp; The mere
machine, the empty ship, he can build as well, and as quickly, as
you can; and though he may not find enough of practised sailors
to man large fighting-fleets&mdash;it is not possible to conceive
that he can want sailors for such sort of purposes as I have
stated.&nbsp; He is at present the despotic monarch of above
twenty thousand miles of sea-coast, and yet you suppose he cannot
procure sailors for the invasion of Ireland.&nbsp; Believe, if
you please, that such a fleet met at sea by any number of our
ships at all comparable to them in point of force, would be
immediately taken, let it be so; I count nothing upon their power
of resistance, only upon their power of escaping
unobserved.&nbsp; If experience has taught us anything, it is the
impossibility of perpetual blockades.&nbsp; The instances are
innumerable, during the course of this war, where whole fleets
have sailed in and out of harbour, in spite of every vigilance
used to prevent it.&nbsp; I shall only mention those cases where
Ireland is concerned.&nbsp; In December, 1796, seven ships of the
line, and ten transports, reached Bantry Bay from Brest, without
having seen an English ship in their passage.&nbsp; It blew a
storm when they were off shore, and therefore England still
continues to be an independent kingdom.&nbsp; You will observe
that at the very time the French fleet sailed out of Brest
Harbour, Admiral Colpoys was cruising off there with a powerful
squadron, and still, from the particular circumstances of the
weather, found it impossible to prevent the French from coming
out.&nbsp; During the time that Admiral Colpoys was cruising off
Brest, Admiral Richery, with six ships of the line, passed him,
and got safe into the harbour.&nbsp; At the very moment when the
French squadron was lying in Bantry Bay, Lord Bridport with his
fleet was locked up by a foul wind in the Channel, and for
several days could not stir to the assistance of Ireland.&nbsp;
Admiral Colpoys, totally unable to find the French fleet, came
home.&nbsp; Lord Bridport, at the change of the wind, cruised for
them in vain, and they got safe back to Brest, without having
seen a single one of those floating bulwarks, the possession of
which we believe will enable us with impunity to set justice and
common sense at defiance.</p>
<p>Such is the miserable and precarious state of an anemocracy,
of a people who put their trust in hurricanes, and are governed
by wind.&nbsp; In August, 1798, three forty-gun frigates landed
1,100 men under Humbert, making the passage from Rochelle to
Killala without seeing any English ship.&nbsp; In October of the
same year, four French frigates anchored in Killala Bay with
2,000 troops; and though they did not land their troops, they
returned to France in safety.&nbsp; In the same month, a
line-of-battle ship, eight stout frigates, and a brig, all full
of troops and stores, reached the coast of Ireland, and were
fortunately, in sight of land, destroyed, after an obstinate
engagement, by Sir John Warren.</p>
<p>If you despise the little troop which, in these numerous
experiments, did make good its landing, take with you, if you
please, this <i>pr&egrave;cis</i> of its exploits: eleven hundred
men, commanded by a soldier raised from the ranks, put to rout a
select army of 6,000 men, commanded by General Lake, seized their
ordnance, ammunition, and stores, advanced 150 miles into a
country containing an armed force of 150,000 men, and at last
surrendered to the Viceroy, an experienced general, gravely and
cautiously advancing at the head of all his chivalry and of an
immense army to oppose him.&nbsp; You must excuse these details
about Ireland, but it appears to me to be of all other subjects
the most important.&nbsp; If we conciliate Ireland, we can do
nothing amiss; if we do not, we can do nothing well.&nbsp; If
Ireland was friendly, we might equally set at defiance the
talents of Bonaparte and the blunders of his rival, Mr. Canning;
we could then support the ruinous and silly bustle of our useless
expeditions, and the almost incredible ignorance of our
commercial orders in council.&nbsp; Let the present
administration give up but this one point, and there is nothing
which I would not consent to grant them.&nbsp; Mr. Perceval shall
have full liberty to insult the tomb of Mr. Fox, and to torment
every eminent Dissenter in Great Britain; Lord Camden shall have
large boxes of plums; Mr. Rose receive permission to prefix to
his name the appellative of virtuous; and to the Viscount
Castlereagh a round sum of ready money shall be well and truly
paid into his hand.&nbsp; Lastly, what remains to Mr. George
Canning, but that he ride up and down Pall Mall glorious upon a
white horse, and that they cry out before him, Thus shall it be
done to the statesman who hath written &ldquo;The Needy
Knife-Grinder,&rdquo; and the German play?&nbsp; Adieu only for
the present; you shall soon hear from me again; it is a subject
upon which I cannot long be silent.</p>
<h2>LETTER VIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> can be more erroneous than
to suppose that Ireland is not bigger than the Isle of Wight, or
of more consequence than Guernsey or Jersey; and yet I am almost
inclined to believe, from the general supineness which prevails
here respecting the dangerous state of that country, that such is
the rank which it holds in our statistical tables.&nbsp; I have
been writing to you a great deal about Ireland, and perhaps it
may be of some use to state to you concisely the nature and
resources of the country which has been the subject of our long
and strange correspondence.&nbsp; There were returned, as I have
before observed, to the hearth tax in 1791, 701,102 houses, which
Mr. Newenham shows from unquestionable documents to be nearly
80,000 below the real number of houses in that country.&nbsp;
There are 27,457 square English miles in Ireland, and more than
five millions of people.</p>
<p>By the last survey it appears that the inhabited houses in
England and Wales amount to 1,574,902, and the population to
9,343,578, which gives an average of 5.875 to each house, in a
country where the density of population is certainly less
considerable than in Ireland.&nbsp; It is commonly supposed that
two-fifths of the army and navy are Irishmen, at periods when
political disaffection does not avert the Catholics from the
service.&nbsp; The current value of Irish exports in 1807 was
&pound;9,314,854 17s. 7d.; a state of commerce about equal to the
commerce of England in the middle of the reign of George
II.&nbsp; The tonnage of ships entered inward and cleared outward
in the trade of Ireland, in 1807, amounted to 1,567,430
tons.&nbsp; The quantity of home spirits exported amounted to
10,284 gallons in 1796, and to 930,800 gallons in 1804.&nbsp; Of
the exports which I have stated, provisions amounted to four
millions, and linen to about four millions and a half.&nbsp;
There was exported from Ireland, upon an average of two years
ending in January, 1804, 591,274 barrels of barley, oats, and
wheat; and by weight 910,848 cwts. of flour, oatmeal, barley,
oats, and wheat.&nbsp; The amount of butter exported in 1804,
from Ireland, was worth, in money, &pound;1,704,680
sterling.&nbsp; The importation of ale and beer, from the immense
manufactures now carrying on of these articles, was diminished to
3,209 barrels, in the year 1804, from 111,920 barrels, which was
the average importation per annum, taking from three years ending
in 1792; and at present there is an export trade of porter.&nbsp;
On an average of three years, ending March, 1783, there were
imported into Ireland, of cotton wool, 3,326 cwts., of cotton
yarn, 5,405 lbs.; but on an average of three years, ending
January, 1803, there were imported, of the first article, 13,159
cwts., and of the latter, 628,406 lbs.&nbsp; It is impossible to
conceive any manufacture more flourishing.&nbsp; The export of
linen has increased in Ireland from 17,776,862 yards, the average
in 1770, to 43,534,971 yards, the amount in 1805.&nbsp; The
tillage of Ireland has more than trebled within the last
twenty-one years.&nbsp; The importation of coals has increased
from 230,000 tons in 1783, to 417,030 in 1804; of tobacco, from
3,459,861 lbs. in 1783, to 6,611,543 in 1804; of tea, from
1,703,855 lbs. in 1783, to 3,358,256 in 1804; of sugar, from
143,117 cwts. in 1782, to 309,076 in 1804.&nbsp; Ireland now
supports a funded debt of above 64 millions, and it is computed
that more than three millions&rsquo; of money are annually
remitted to Irish absentees resident in this country.&nbsp; In
Mr. Foster&rsquo;s report, of 100 folio pages, presented to the
House of Commons in the year 1806, the total expenditure of
Ireland is stated at &pound;9,760,013.&nbsp; Ireland has
increased about two-thirds in its population within twenty-five
years, and yet, and in about the same space of time, its exports
of beef, bullocks, cows, pork, swine, butter, wheat, barley, and
oats, collectively taken, have doubled; and this, in spite of two
years&rsquo; famine, and the presence of an immense army, that is
always at hand to guard the most valuable appanage of our empire
from joining our most inveterate enemies.&nbsp; Ireland has the
greatest possible facilities for carrying on commerce with the
whole of Europe.&nbsp; It contains, within a circuit of 750
miles, 66 secure harbours, and presents a western frontier
against Great Britain, reaching from the Firth of Clyde north to
the Bristol Channel south, and varying in distance from 20 to 100
miles; so that the subjugation of Ireland would compel us to
guard with ships and soldiers a new line of coast, certainly
amounting, with all its sinuosities, to more than 700
miles&mdash;an addition of polemics, in our present state of
hostility with all the world, which must highly gratify the
vigorists, and give them an ample opportunity of displaying that
foolish energy upon which their claims to distinction are
founded.&nbsp; Such is the country which the Right Reverend the
Chancellor of the Exchequer would drive into the arms of France,
and for the conciliation of which we are requested to wait, as if
it were one of those sinecure places which were given to Mr.
Perceval snarling at the breast, and which cannot be abolished
till his decease.</p>
<p>How sincerely and fervently have I often wished that the
Emperor of the French had thought as Mr. Spencer Perceval does
upon the subject of government; that he had entertained doubts
and scruples upon the propriety of admitting the Protestants to
an equality of rights with the Catholics, and that he had left in
the middle of his empire these vigorous seeds of hatred and
disaffection!&nbsp; But the world was never yet conquered by a
blockhead.&nbsp; One of the very first measures we saw him
recurring to was the complete establishment of religious liberty:
if his subjects fought and paid as he pleased, he allowed them to
believe as they pleased: the moment I saw this, my best hopes
were lost.&nbsp; I perceived in a moment the kind of man we had
to do with.&nbsp; I was well aware of the miserable ignorance and
folly of this country upon the subject of toleration; and every
year has been adding to the success of that game, which it was
clear he had the will and the ability to play against us.</p>
<p>You say Bonaparte is not in earnest upon the subject of
religion, and that this is the cause of his tolerant spirit; but
is it possible you can intend to give us such dreadful and
unamiable notions of religion.&nbsp; Are we to understand that
the moment a man is sincere he is narrow-minded; that persecution
is the child of belief; and that a desire to leave all men in the
quiet and unpunished exercise of their own creed can only exist
in the mind of an infidel?&nbsp; Thank God! I know many men whose
principles are as firm as they are expanded, who cling
tenaciously to their own modification of the Christian faith,
without the slightest disposition to force that modification upon
other people.&nbsp; If Bonaparte is liberal in subjects of
religion because he has no religion, is this a reason why we
should be illiberal because we are Christians?&nbsp; If he owes
this excellent quality to a vice, is that any reason why we may
not owe it to a virtue?&nbsp; Toleration is a great good, and a
good to be imitated, let it come from whom it will.&nbsp; If a
sceptic is tolerant, it only shows that he is not foolish in
practice as well as erroneous in theory.&nbsp; If a religious man
is tolerant, it evinces that he is religious from thought and
inquiry, because he exhibits in his conduct one of the most
beautiful and important consequences of a religious mind&mdash;an
inviolable charity to all the honest varieties of human
opinion.</p>
<p>Lord Sidmouth, and all the anti-Catholic people, little
foresee that they will hereafter be the sport of the antiquary;
that their prophecies of ruin and destruction from Catholic
emancipation will be clapped into the notes of some quaint
history, and be matter of pleasantry even to the sedulous
housewife and the rural dean.&nbsp; There is always a copious
supply of Lord Sidmouths in the world; nor is there one single
source of human happiness against which they have not uttered the
most lugubrious predictions.&nbsp; Turnpike roads, navigable
canals, inoculation, hops, tobacco, the Reformation, the
Revolution&mdash;there are always a set of worthy and
moderately-gifted men, who bawl out death and ruin upon every
valuable change which the varying aspect of human affairs
absolutely and imperiously requires.&nbsp; I have often thought
that it would be extremely useful to make a collection of the
hatred and abuse that all those changes have experienced, which
are now admitted to be marked improvements in our
condition.&nbsp; Such a history might make folly a little more
modest, and suspicious of its own decisions.</p>
<p>Ireland, you say, since the Union is to be considered as a
part of the whole kingdom; and therefore, however Catholics may
predominate in that particular spot, yet, taking the whole empire
together, they are to be considered as a much more insignificant
quota of the population.&nbsp; Consider them in what light you
please, as part of the whole, or by themselves, or in what manner
may be most consentaneous to the devices of your holy
mind&mdash;I say in a very few words, if you do not relieve these
people from the civil incapacities to which they are exposed, you
will lose them; or you must employ great strength and much
treasure in watching over them.&nbsp; In the present state of the
world you can afford to do neither the one nor the other.&nbsp;
Having stated this, I shall leave you to be ruined, Puffendorf in
hand (as Mr. Secretary Canning says), and to lose Ireland, just
as you have found out what proportion the aggrieved people should
bear to the whole population before their calamities meet with
redress.&nbsp; As for your parallel cases, I am no more afraid of
deciding upon them than I am upon their prototype.&nbsp; If ever
any one heresy should so far spread itself over the principality
of Wales that the Established Church were left in a minority of
one to four; if you had subjected these heretics to very severe
civil privations; if the consequence of such privations were a
universal state of disaffection among that caseous and wrathful
people; and if at the same time you were at war with all the
world, how can you doubt for a moment that I would instantly
restore them to a state of the most complete civil liberty?&nbsp;
What matters it under what name you put the same case?&nbsp;
Common sense is not changed by appellations.&nbsp; I have said
how I would act to Ireland, and I would act so to all the
world.</p>
<p>I admit that, to a certain degree, the Government will lose
the affections of the Orangemen by emancipating the Catholics;
much less, however, at present, than three years past.&nbsp; The
few men, who have ill-treated the whole crew, live in constant
terror that the oppressed people will rise upon them and carry
the ship into Brest:&mdash;they begin to find that it is a very
tiresome thing to sleep every night with cocked pistols under
their pillows, and to breakfast, dine, and sup with drawn
hangers.&nbsp; They suspect that the privilege of beating and
kicking the rest of the sailors is hardly worth all this anxiety,
and that if the ship does ever fall into the hands of the
disaffected, all the cruelties which they have experienced will
be thoroughly remembered and amply repaid.&nbsp; To a short
period of disaffection among the Orangemen I confess I should not
much object: my love of poetical justice does carry me as far as
that; one summer&rsquo;s whipping, only one: the thumb-screw for
a short season; a little light easy torturing between Ladyday and
Michaelmas; a short specimen of Mr. Perceval&rsquo;s
rigour.&nbsp; I have malice enough to ask this slight atonement
for the groans and shrieks of the poor Catholics, unheard by any
human tribunal, but registered by the Angel of God against their
Protestant and enlightened oppressors.</p>
<p>Besides, if you who count ten so often can count five, you
must perceive that it is better to have four friends and one
enemy than four enemies and one friend; and the more violent the
hatred of the Orangemen, the more certain the reconciliation of
the Catholics.&nbsp; The disaffection of the Orangemen will be
the Irish rainbow: when I see it I shall be sure that the storm
is over.</p>
<p>If these incapacities, from which the Catholics ask to be
relieved, were to the mass of them only a mere feeling of pride,
and if the question were respecting the attainment of privileges
which could be of importance only to the highest of the sect, I
should still say that the pride of the mass was very naturally
wounded by the degradation of their superiors.&nbsp; Indignity to
George Rose would be felt by the smallest nummary gentleman in
the king&rsquo;s employ; and Mr. John Bannister could not be
indifferent to anything which happened to Mr. Canning.&nbsp; But
the truth is, it is a most egregious mistake to suppose that the
Catholics are contending merely for the fringes and feathers of
their chiefs.&nbsp; I will give you a list in my next Letter of
those privations which are represented to be of no consequence to
anybody but Lord Fingal, and some twenty or thirty of the
principal persons of their sect.&nbsp; In the meantime, adieu,
and be wise.</p>
<h3>LETTER IX.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Abraham</span>,&mdash;No Catholic can
be chief Governor or Governor of this kingdom, Chancellor or
Keeper of the Great Seal, Lord High Treasurer, Chief of any of
the Courts of Justice, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Puisne Judge,
Judge in the Admiralty, Master of the Rolls, Secretary of State,
Keeper of the Privy Seal, Vice-Treasurer or his Deputy, Teller or
Cashier of Exchequer, Auditor or General, Governor or Custos
Rotulorum of Counties, Chief Governor&rsquo;s Secretary, Privy
Councillor, King&rsquo;s Counsel, Serjeant, Attorney,
Solicitor-General, Master in Chancery, Provost or Fellow of
Trinity College, Dublin, Postmaster-General, Master and
Lieutenant-General of Ordnance, Commander-in-Chief, General on
the Staff, Sheriff, Sub-Sheriff, Mayor, Bailiff, Recorder,
Burgess, or any other officer in a City, or a Corporation.&nbsp;
No Catholic can be guardian to a Protestant, and no priest
guardian at all; no Catholic can be a gamekeeper, or have for
sale, or otherwise, any arms or warlike stores; no Catholic can
present to a living, unless he choose to turn Jew in order to
obtain that privilege; the pecuniary qualification of Catholic
jurors is made higher than that of Protestants, and no relaxation
of the ancient rigorous code is permitted, unless to those who
shall take an oath prescribed by 13 and 14 George III.&nbsp; Now
if this is not picking the plums out of the pudding and leaving
the mere batter to the Catholics, I know not what is.&nbsp; If it
were merely the Privy Council, it would be (I allow) nothing but
a point of honour for which the mass of Catholics were
contending, the honour of being chief-mourners or pall-bearers to
the country; but surely no man will contend that every barrister
may not speculate upon the possibility of being a Puisne Judge;
and that every shopkeeper must not feel himself injured by his
exclusion from borough offices.</p>
<p>One of the greatest practical evils which the Catholics suffer
in Ireland is their exclusion from the offices of Sheriff and
Deputy Sheriff.&nbsp; Nobody who is unacquainted with Ireland can
conceive the obstacles which this opposes to the fair
administration of justice.&nbsp; The formation of juries is now
entirely in the hands of the Protestants; the lives, liberties,
and properties of the Catholics in the hands of the juries; and
this is the arrangement for the administration of justice in a
country where religious prejudices are inflamed to the greatest
degree of animosity!&nbsp; In this country, if a man be a
foreigner, if he sell slippers, and sealing wax, and artificial
flowers, we are so tender of human life that we take care half
the number of persons who are to decide upon his fate should be
men of similar prejudices and feelings with himself: but a poor
Catholic in Ireland may be tried by twelve Percevals, and
destroyed according to the manner of that gentleman in the name
of the Lord, and with all the insulting forms of justice.&nbsp; I
do not go the length of saying that deliberate and wilful
injustice is done.&nbsp; I have no doubt that the Orange Deputy
Sheriff thinks it would be a most unpardonable breach of his duty
if he did not summon a Protestant panel.&nbsp; I can easily
believe that the Protestant panel may conduct themselves very
conscientiously in hanging the gentlemen of the crucifix; but I
blame the law which does not guard the Catholic against the
probable tenor of those feelings which must unconsciously
influence the judgments of mankind.&nbsp; I detest that state of
society which extends unequal degrees of protection to different
creeds and persuasions; and I cannot describe to you the contempt
I feel for a man who, calling himself a statesman, defends a
system which fills the heart of every Irishman with treason, and
makes his allegiance prudence, not choice.</p>
<p>I request to know if the vestry taxes in Ireland are a mere
matter of romantic feeling which can affect only the Earl of
Fingal?&nbsp; In a parish where there are four thousand Catholics
and fifty Protestants, the Protestants may meet together in a
vestry meeting at which no Catholic has the right to vote, and
tax all the lands in the parish 1s. 6d. per acre, or in the
pound, I forget which, for the repairs of the church&mdash;and
how has the necessity of these repairs been ascertained?&nbsp; A
Protestant plumber has discovered that it wants new leading; a
Protestant carpenter is convinced the timbers are not sound; and
the glazier who hates holy water (as an accoucheur hates
celibacy, because he gets nothing by it) is employed to put in
new sashes.</p>
<p>The grand juries in Ireland are the great scene of
jobbing.&nbsp; They have a power of making a county rate to a
considerable extent for roads, bridges, and other objects of
general accommodation.&nbsp; &ldquo;You suffer the road to be
brought through my park, and I will have the bridge constructed
in a situation where it will make a beautiful object to your
house.&nbsp; You do my job, and I will do yours.&rdquo;&nbsp;
These are the sweet and interesting subjects which occasionally
occupy Milesian gentlemen while they are attendant upon this
grand inquest of justice.&nbsp; But there is a religion, it
seems, even in jobs; and it will be highly gratifying to Mr.
Perceval to learn that no man in Ireland who believes in seven
sacraments can carry a public road, or bridge, one yard out of
the direction most beneficial to the public, and that nobody can
cheat the public who does not expound the Scriptures in the
purest and most orthodox manner.&nbsp; This will give pleasure to
Mr. Perceval: but, from his unfairness upon these topics I appeal
to the justice and the proper feelings of Mr. Huskisson.&nbsp; I
ask him if the human mind can experience a more dreadful
sensation than to see its own jobs refused, and the jobs of
another religion perpetually succeeding?&nbsp; I ask him his
opinion of a jobless faith, of a creed which dooms a man through
life to a lean and plunderless integrity.&nbsp; He knows that
human nature cannot and will not bear it; and if we were to paint
a political Tartarus, it would be an endless series of snug
expectations and cruel disappointments.&nbsp; These are a few of
many dreadful inconveniences which the Catholics of all ranks
suffer from the laws by which they are at present
oppressed.&nbsp; Besides, look at human nature: what is the
history of all professions?&nbsp; Joel is to be brought up to the
bar: has Mrs. Plymley the slightest doubt of his being
Chancellor?&nbsp; Do not his two shrivelled aunts live in the
certainty of seeing him in that situation, and of cutting out
with their own hands his equity habiliments?&nbsp; And I could
name a certain minister of the Gospel who does not, in the bottom
of his heart, much differ from these opinions.&nbsp; Do you think
that the fathers and mothers of the holy Catholic Church are not
as absurd as Protestant papas and mammas?&nbsp; The probability I
admit to be, in each particular case, that the sweet little
blockhead will in fact never get a brief;&mdash;but I will
venture to say, there is not a parent from the Giant&rsquo;s
Causeway to Bantry Bay who does not conceive that his child is
the unfortunate victim of the exclusion, and that nothing short
of positive law could prevent his own dear, pre-eminent Paddy
from rising to the highest honours of the State.&nbsp; So with
the army and parliament; in fact, few are excluded; but, in
imagination, all: you keep twenty or thirty Catholics out, and
you lose the affections of four millions; and, let me tell you,
that recent circumstances have by no means tended to diminish in
the minds of men that hope of elevation beyond their own rank
which is so congenial to our nature: from pleading for John Roe
to taxing John Bull, from jesting for Mr. Pitt and writing in the
<i>Anti-Jacobin</i>, to managing the affairs of
Europe&mdash;these are leaps which seem to justify the fondest
dreams of mothers and of aunts.</p>
<p>I do not say that the disabilities to which the Catholics are
exposed amount to such intolerable grievances, that the strength
and industry of a nation are overwhelmed by them: the increasing
prosperity of Ireland fully demonstrates to the contrary.&nbsp;
But I repeat again, what I have often stated in the course of our
correspondence, that your laws against the Catholics are exactly
in that state in which you have neither the benefits of rigour
nor of liberality: every law which prevented the Catholic from
gaining strength and wealth is repealed; every law which can
irritate remains; if you were determined to insult the Catholics,
you should have kept them weak; if you resolved to give them
strength, you should have ceased to insult them&mdash;at present
your conduct is pure, unadulterated folly.</p>
<p>Lord Hawkesbury says, &ldquo;We heard nothing about the
Catholics till we began to mitigate the laws against them; when
we relieved them in part from this oppression they began to be
disaffected.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is very true; but it proves just
what I have said, that you have either done too much or too
little; and as there lives not, I hope, upon earth, so depraved a
courtier that he would load the Catholics with their ancient
chains, what absurdity it is, then, not to render their
dispositions friendly, when you leave their arms and legs
free!</p>
<p>You know, and many Englishmen know, what passes in China; but
nobody knows or cares what passes in Ireland.&nbsp; At the
beginning of the present reign no Catholic could realise
property, or carry on any business; they were absolutely
annihilated, had had no more agency in the country than so many
trees.&nbsp; They were like Lord Mulgrave&rsquo;s eloquence and
Lord Camden&rsquo;s wit; the legislative bodies did not know of
their existence.&nbsp; For these twenty-five years last past the
Catholics have been engaged in commerce; within that period the
commerce of Ireland has doubled&mdash;there are four Catholics at
work for one Protestant, and eight Catholics at work for one
Episcopalian.&nbsp; Of course, the proportion which Catholic
wealth bears to Protestant wealth is every year altering rapidly
in favour of the Catholics.&nbsp; I have already told you what
their purchases of land were the last year: since that period I
have been at some pains to find out the actual state of the
Catholic wealth: it is impossible upon such a subject to arrive
at complete accuracy; but I have good reason to believe that
there are at present 2,000 Catholics in Ireland, possessing an
income of &pound;500 and upwards, many of these with incomes of
one, two, three, and four thousand, and some amounting to fifteen
and twenty thousand per annum:&mdash;and this is the kingdom, and
these the people, for whose conciliation we are to wait Heaven
knows when, and Lord Hawkesbury why!&nbsp; As for me, I never
think of the situation of Ireland without feeling the same
necessity for immediate interference as I should do if I saw
blood flowing from a great artery.&nbsp; I rush towards it with
the instinctive rapidity of a man desirous of preventing death,
and have no other feeling but that in a few seconds the patient
may be no more.</p>
<p>I could not help smiling, in the times of No Popery, to
witness the loyal indignation of many persons at the attempt made
by the last ministry to do something for the relief of
Ireland.&nbsp; The general cry in the country was, that they
would not see their beloved Monarch used ill in his old age, and
that they would stand by him to the last drop of their
blood.&nbsp; I respect good feelings, however erroneous be the
occasions on which they display themselves; and therefore I saw
in all this as much to admire as to blame.&nbsp; It was a species
of affection, however, which reminded me very forcibly of the
attachment displayed by the servants of the Russian ambassador at
the beginning of the last century.&nbsp; His Excellency happened
to fall down in a kind of apoplectic fit, when he was paying a
morning visit in the house of an acquaintance.&nbsp; The
confusion was of course very great, and messengers were
despatched in every direction to find a surgeon: who, upon his
arrival, declared that his Excellency must be immediately
blooded, and prepared himself forthwith to perform the operation:
the barbarous servants of the embassy, who were there in great
numbers, no sooner saw the surgeon prepared to wound the arm of
their master with a sharp, shining instrument, than they drew
their swords, put themselves in an attitude of defence, and swore
in pure Sclavonic, &ldquo;that they would murder any man who
attempted to do him the slightest injury: he had been a very good
master to them, and they would not desert him in his misfortunes,
or suffer his blood to be shed while he was off his guard, and
incapable of defending himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; By good fortune, the
secretary arrived about this period of the dispute, and his
Excellency, relieved from superfluous blood and perilous
affection, was, after much difficulty, restored to life.</p>
<p>There is an argument brought forward with some appearance of
plausibility in the House of Commons, which certainly merits an
answer: You know that the Catholics now vote for members of
parliament in Ireland, and that they outnumber the Protestants in
a very great proportion; if you allow Catholics to sit in
parliament, religion will be found to influence votes more than
property, and the greater part of the 100 Irish members who are
returned to parliament will be Catholics.&nbsp; Add to these the
Catholic members who are returned in England, and you will have a
phalanx of heretical strength which every minister will be
compelled to respect, and occasionally to conciliate by
concessions incompatible with the interests of the Protestant
Church.&nbsp; The fact is, however, that you are at this moment
subjected to every danger of this kind which you can possibly
apprehend hereafter.&nbsp; If the spiritual interests of the
voters are more powerful than their temporal interests, they can
bind down their representatives to support any measures
favourable to the Catholic religion, and they can change the
objects of their choice till they have found Protestant members
(as they easily may do) perfectly obedient to their wishes.&nbsp;
If the superior possessions of the Protestants prevent the
Catholics from uniting for a common political object, then the
danger you fear cannot exist: if zeal, on the contrary, gets the
better of acres, then the danger at present exists, from the
right of voting already given to the Catholics, and it will not
be increased by allowing them to sit in parliament.&nbsp; There
are, as nearly as I can recollect, thirty seats in Ireland for
cities and counties, where the Protestants are the most numerous,
and where the members returned must of course be
Protestants.&nbsp; In the other seventy representations the
wealth of the Protestants is opposed to the number of the
Catholics; and if all the seventy members returned were of the
Catholic persuasion, they must still plot the destruction of our
religion in the midst of 588 Protestants.&nbsp; Such terrors
would disgrace a cook-maid, or a toothless aunt&mdash;when they
fall from the lips of bearded and senatorial men, they are
nauseous, antiperistaltic, and emetical.</p>
<p>How can you for a moment doubt of the rapid effects which
would be produced by the emancipation?&nbsp; In the first place,
to my certain knowledge the Catholics have long since expressed
to his Majesty&rsquo;s Ministers their perfect readiness <i>to
vest in his Majesty</i>, <i>either with the consent of the
Pope</i>, <i>or without it if it cannot be obtained</i>, <i>the
nomination of the Catholic prelacy</i>.&nbsp; The Catholic
prelacy in Ireland consists of twenty-six bishops and the warden
of Galway, a dignitary enjoying Catholic jurisdiction.&nbsp; The
number of Roman Catholic priests in Ireland exceeds one
thousand.&nbsp; The expenses of his peculiar worship are, to a
substantial farmer or mechanic, five shillings per annum; to a
labourer (where he is not entirely excused) one shilling per
annum; this includes the contribution of the whole family, and
for this the priest is bound to attend them when sick, and to
confess them when they apply to him; he is also to keep his
chapel in order, to celebrate divine service, and to preach on
Sundays and holydays.</p>
<p>In the northern district a priest gains from &pound;30 to
&pound;50; in the other parts of Ireland from &pound;60 to
&pound;90 per annum.&nbsp; The best paid Catholic bishops receive
about &pound;400 per annum; the others from &pound;300 to
&pound;350.&nbsp; My plan is very simple: I would have 300
Catholic parishes at &pound;100 per annum, 300 at &pound;200 per
annum, and 400 at &pound;300 per annum; this, for the whole
thousand parishes, would amount to &pound;190,000.&nbsp; To the
prelacy I would allot &pound;20,000 in unequal proportions, from
&pound;1,000 to &pound;500; and I would appropriate &pound;40,000
more for the support of Catholic schools, and the repairs of
Catholic churches; the whole amount of which sum is
&pound;250,000, about the expense of three days of one of our
genuine, good English <i>just and necessary wars</i>.&nbsp; The
clergy should all receive their salaries at the Bank of Ireland,
and I would place the whole patronage in the hands of the
Crown.&nbsp; Now, I appeal to any human being, except Spencer
Perceval, Esq., of the parish of Hampstead, what the disaffection
of a clergy would amount to, gaping after this graduated bounty
of the Crown, and whether Ignatius Loyala himself, if he were a
living blockhead instead of a dead saint, could withstand the
temptation of bouncing from &pound;100 a year at Sligo, to
&pound;300 in Tipperary?&nbsp; This is the miserable sum of money
for which the merchants and landowners and nobility of England
are exposing themselves to the tremendous peril of losing
Ireland.&nbsp; The sinecure places of the Roses and the
Percevals, and the &ldquo;dear and near relations,&rdquo; put up
to auction at thirty years&rsquo; purchase, would almost amount
to the money.</p>
<p>I admit that nothing can be more reasonable than to expect
that a Catholic priest should starve to death, genteelly and
pleasantly, for the good of the Protestant religion; but is it
equally reasonable to expect that he should do so for the
Protestant pews, and Protestant brick and mortar?&nbsp; On an
Irish Sabbath, the bell of a neat parish church often summons to
church only the parson and an occasionally conforming clerk;
while, two hundred yards off, a thousand Catholics are huddled
together in a miserable hovel, and pelted by all the storms of
heaven.&nbsp; Can anything be more distressing than to see a
venerable man pouring forth sublime truths in tattered breeches,
and depending for his food upon the little offal he gets from his
parishioners?&nbsp; I venerate a human being who starves for his
principles, let them be what they may; but starving for anything
is not at all to the taste of the honourable flagellants: strict
principles, and good pay, is the motto of Mr. Perceval: the one
he keeps in great measure for the faults of his enemies, the
other for himself.</p>
<p>There are parishes in Connaught in which a Protestant was
never settled nor even seen.&nbsp; In that province in Munster,
and in parts of Leinster, the entire peasantry for sixty miles
are Catholics; in these tracts the churches are frequently shut
for want of a congregation, or opened to an assemblage of from
six to twenty persons.&nbsp; Of what Protestants there are in
Ireland, the greatest part are gathered together in Ulster, or
they live in towns.&nbsp; In the country of the other three
provinces the Catholics see no other religion but their own, and
are at the least as fifteen to one Protestant.&nbsp; In the
diocese of Tuam they are sixty to one; in the parish of St.
Mulins, diocese of Leghlin, there are four thousand Catholics and
one Protestant; in the town of Grasgenamana, in the county of
Kilkenny, there are between four and five hundred Catholic
houses, and three Protestant houses.&nbsp; In the parish of
Allen, county Kildare, there is no Protestant, though it is very
populous.&nbsp; In the parish of Arlesin, Queen&rsquo;s County,
the proportion is one hundred to one.&nbsp; In the whole county
of Kilkenny, by actual enumeration, it is seventeen to one; in
the diocese of Kilmacduagh, province of Connaught, fifty-two to
one, by ditto.&nbsp; These I give you as a few specimens of the
present state of Ireland; and yet there are men impudent and
ignorant enough to contend that such evils require no remedy, and
that mild family man who dwelleth in Hampstead can find none but
the cautery and the knife.</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;&ldquo;Omne per ignem<br />
Excoquitur vitium.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot describe the horror and disgust which I felt at
hearing Mr. Perceval call upon the then Ministry for measures of
vigour in Ireland.&nbsp; If I lived at Hampstead upon stewed
meats and claret; if I walked to church every Sunday before
eleven young gentlemen of my own begetting, with their faces
washed, and their hair pleasingly combed; if the Almighty had
blessed me with every earthly comfort&mdash;how awfully would I
pause before I sent forth the flame and the sword over the cabins
of the poor, brave, generous, open-hearted peasants of
Ireland!&nbsp; How easy it is to shed human blood; how easy it is
to persuade ourselves that it is our duty to do so, and that the
decision has cost us a severe struggle; how much in all ages have
wounds and shrieks and tears been the cheap and vulgar resources
of the rulers of mankind; how difficult and how noble it is to
govern in kindness and to found an empire upon the everlasting
basis of justice and affection!&nbsp; But what do men call
vigour?&nbsp; To let loose hussars and to bring up artillery, to
govern with lighted matches, and to cut, and push, and prime; I
call this not vigour, but the <i>sloth of cruelty and
ignorance</i>.&nbsp; The vigour I love consists in finding out
wherein subjects are aggrieved, in relieving them, in studying
the temper and genius of a people, in consulting their
prejudices, in selecting proper persons to lead and manage them,
in the laborious, watchful, and difficult task of increasing
public happiness by allaying each particular discontent.&nbsp; In
this way Hoche pacified La Vend&eacute;e&mdash;and in this way
only will Ireland ever be subdued.&nbsp; But this, in the eyes of
Mr. Perceval, is imbecility and meanness.&nbsp; Houses are not
broken open, women are not insulted, the people seem all to be
happy; they are not rode over by horses, and cut by whips.&nbsp;
Do you call this vigour?&nbsp; Is this government?</p>
<h3>LETTER X.&nbsp; AND LAST.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">You</span> must observe that all I have
said of the effects which will be produced by giving salaries to
the Catholic clergy, only proceeds upon the supposition that the
emanciptaion of the laity is effected:&mdash;without that, I am
sure there is not a clergyman in Ireland who would receive a
shilling from government; he could not do so, without an entire
loss of credit among the members of his own persuasion.</p>
<p>What you say of the moderation of the Irish Protestant clergy
in collecting tithes, is, I believe, strictly true.&nbsp; Instead
of collecting what the law enables them to collect, I believe
they seldom or ever collect more than two-thirds; and I entirely
agree with you, that the abolition of agistment tithe in Ireland
by a vote of the Irish House of Commons, and without any
remuneration to the Church, was a most scandalous and Jacobinical
measure.&nbsp; I do not blame the Irish clergy; but I submit to
your common sense, if it be possible to explain to an Irish
peasant upon what principle of justice, or common sense, he is to
pay every tenth potato in his little garden to a clergyman in
whose religion nobody believes for twenty miles around him, and
who has nothing to preach to but bare walls?&nbsp; It is true, if
the tithes are bought up, the cottager must pay more rent to his
landlord; but the same thing done in the shape of rent is less
odious than when it is done in the shape of tithe.&nbsp; I do not
want to take a shilling out of the pockets of the clergy, but to
leave the substance of things, and to change their names.&nbsp; I
cannot see the slightest reason why the Irish labourer is to be
relieved from the real onus, or from anything else but the name
of tithe.&nbsp; At present he rents only nine-tenths of the
produce of the land, which is all that belongs to the owner; this
he has at the market price; if the landowner purchase the other
tenth of the Church, of course he has a right to make a
correspondent advance upon his tenant.</p>
<p>I very much doubt, if you were to lay open all civil offices
to the Catholics, and to grant salaries to their clergy, in the
manner I have stated, if the Catholic laity would give themselves
much trouble about the advance of their Church; for they would
pay the same tithes under one system that they do under
another.&nbsp; If you were to bring the Catholics into the
daylight of the world, to the high situations of the army, the
navy, and the bar, numbers of them would come over to the
Established Church, and do as other people do; instead of that,
you set a mark of infamy upon them, rouse every passion of our
nature in favour of their creed, and then wonder that men are
blind to the follies of the Catholic religion.&nbsp; There are
hardly any instances of old and rich families among the
Protestant Dissenters: when a man keeps a coach, and lives in
good company, he comes to church, and gets ashamed of the
meeting-house; if this is not the case with the father, it is
almost always the case with the son.&nbsp; These things would
never be so if the Dissenters were in <i>practice</i> as much
excluded from all the concerns of civil life as the Catholics
are.&nbsp; If a rich young Catholic were in Parliament, he would
belong to White&rsquo;s and to Brookes&rsquo;s, would keep
race-horses, would walk up and down Pall Mall, be exonerated of
his ready money and his constitution, become as totally devoid of
morality, honesty, knowledge, and civility as Protestant loungers
in Pall Mall, and return home with a supreme contempt for Father
O&rsquo;Leary and Father O&rsquo;Callaghan.&nbsp; I am astonished
at the madness of the Catholic clergy in not perceiving that
Catholic emancipation is Catholic infidelity; that to entangle
their people in the intrigues of a Protestant parliament, and a
Protestant court, is to ensure the loss of every man of fashion
and consequence in their community.&nbsp; The true receipt for
preserving their religion, is Mr. Perceval&rsquo;s receipt for
destroying it: it is to deprive every rich Catholic of all the
objects of secular ambition, to separate him from the Protestant,
and to shut him up in his castle with priests and relics.</p>
<p>We are told, in answer to all our arguments, that this is not
a fit period&mdash;that a period of universal war is not the
proper time for dangerous innovations in the constitution: this
is as much as to say, that the worst time for making friends is
the period when you have made many enemies; that it is the
greatest of all errors to stop when you are breathless, and to
lie down when you are fatigued.&nbsp; Of one thing I am quite
certain: if the safety of Europe is once completely restored, the
Catholics may for ever bid adieu to the slightest probability of
effecting their object.&nbsp; Such men as hang about a court not
only are deaf to the suggestions of mere justice, but they
despise justice; they detest the word <i>right</i>; the only word
which rouses them is <i>peril</i>; where they can oppress with
impunity, they oppress for ever, and call it loyalty and
wisdom.</p>
<p>I am so far from conceiving the legitimate strength of the
Crown would be diminished by these abolitions of civil
incapacities in consequence of religious opinions, that my only
objection to the increase of religious freedom is, that it would
operate as a diminution of political freedom; the power of the
Crown is so overbearing at this period, that almost the only
steady opposers of its fatal influence are men disgusted by
religious intolerance.&nbsp; Our establishments are so enormous,
and so utterly disproportioned to our population, that every
second or third man you meet in society gains something from the
public; my brother the commissioner,&mdash;my nephew the police
justice,&mdash;purveyor of small beer to the army in
Ireland,&mdash;clerk of the mouth,&mdash;yeoman to the left
hand,&mdash;these are the obstacles which common sense and
justice have now to overcome.&nbsp; Add to this that the King,
old and infirm, excites a principle of very amiable generosity in
his favour; that he has led a good, moral, and religious life,
equally removed from profligacy and methodistical hypocrisy; that
he has been a good husband, a good father, and a good master;
that he dresses plain, loves hunting and farming, fates the
French, and is in all his opinions and habits, quite
English:&mdash;these feelings are heightened by the present
situation of the world, and the yet unexploded clamour of
Jacobinism.&nbsp; In short, from the various sources of interest,
personal regard, and national taste, such a tempest of loyalty
has set in upon the people that the 47th proposition in Euclid
might now be voted down with as much ease as any proposition in
politics; and therefore if Lord Hawkesbury hates the abstract
truths of science as much as he hates concrete truth in human
affairs, now is his time for getting rid of the multiplication
table, and passing a vote of censure upon the pretensions of the
<i>hypotenuse</i>.&nbsp; Such is the history of English parties
at this moment: you cannot seriously suppose that the people care
for such men as Lord Hawkesbury, Mr. Canning, and Mr. Perceval on
their own account; you cannot really believe them to be so
degraded as to look to their safety from a man who proposes to
subdue Europe by keeping it without Jesuit&rsquo;s Bark.&nbsp;
The people at present have one passion, and but one&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A Jove principium, Jovis omnia
plena.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They care no more for the ministers I have mentioned, than
they do for those sturdy royalists who for &pound;60 per annum
stand behind his Majesty&rsquo;s carriage, arrayed in scarlet and
in gold.&nbsp; If the present ministers opposed the Court instead
of flattering it, they would not command twenty votes.</p>
<p>Do not imagine by these observations that I am not loyal;
without joining in the common cant of the best of kings, I
respect the King most sincerely as a good man.&nbsp; His religion
is better than the religion of Mr. Perceval, his old morality
very superior to the old morality of Mr. Canning, and I am quite
certain he has a safer understanding than both of them put
together.&nbsp; Loyalty within the bounds of reason and
moderation is one of the great instruments of human happiness;
but the love of the king may easily become more strong than the
love of the kingdom, and we may lose sight of the public welfare
in our exaggerated admiration of him who is appointed to reign
only for its promotion and support.&nbsp; I detest Jacobinism;
and if I am doomed to be a slave at all, I would rather be the
slave of a king than a cobbler.&nbsp; God save the King, you say,
warms your heart like the sound of a trumpet.&nbsp; I cannot make
use of so violent a metaphor; but I am delighted to hear it, when
it is the cry of genuine affection; I am delighted to hear it
when they hail not only the individual man, but the outward and
living sign of all English blessings.&nbsp; These are noble
feelings, and the heart of every good man must go with them; but
God save the King, in these times, too often means God save my
pension and my place, God give my sisters an allowance out of the
privy purse&mdash;make me clerk of the irons, let me survey the
meltings, let me live upon the fruits of other men&rsquo;s
industry, and fatten upon the plunder of the public.</p>
<p>What is it possible to say to such a man as the Gentleman of
Hampstead, who really believes it feasible to convert the four
million Irish Catholics to the Protestant religion, and considers
this as the best remedy for the disturbed state of Ireland?&nbsp;
It is not possible to answer such a man with arguments; we must
come out against him with beads and a cowl, and push him into an
hermitage.&nbsp; It is really such trash, that it is an abuse of
the privilege of reasoning to reply to it.&nbsp; Such a project
is well worthy the statesman who would bring the French to reason
by keeping them without rhubarb, and exhibit to mankind the awful
spectacle of a nation deprived of neutral salts.&nbsp; This is
not the dream of a wild apothecary indulging in his own opium;
this is not the distempered fancy of a pounder of drugs,
delirious from smallness of profits; but it is the sober,
deliberate, and systematic scheme of a man to whom the public
safety is intrusted, and whose appointment is considered by many
as a masterpiece of political sagacity.&nbsp; What a sublime
thought, that no purge can now be taken between the Weser and the
Garonne; that the bustling pestle is still, the canorous mortar
mute, and the bowels of mankind locked up for fourteen degrees of
latitude!&nbsp; When, I should be curious to know, were all the
powers of crudity and flatulence fully explained to his
Majesty&rsquo;s ministers?&nbsp; At what period was this great
plan of conquest and constipation fully developed?&nbsp; In whose
mind was the idea of destroying the pride and the plasters of
France first engendered?&nbsp; Without castor oil they might for
some months, to be sure, have carried on a lingering war! but can
they do without bark?&nbsp; Will the people live under a
government where antimonial powders cannot be procured?&nbsp;
Will they bear the loss of mercury?&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
the rub.&rdquo;&nbsp; Depend upon it, the absence of the materia
medica will soon bring them to their senses, and the cry of
<i>Bourbon and bolus</i> burst forth from the Baltic to the
Mediterranean.</p>
<p>You ask me for any precedent in our history where the oath of
supremacy has been dispensed with.&nbsp; It was dispensed with to
the Catholics of Canada in 1774.&nbsp; They are only required to
take a simple oath of allegiance.&nbsp; The same, I believe, was
the case in Corsica.&nbsp; The reason of such exemption was
obvious; you could not possibly have retained either of these
countries without it.&nbsp; And what did it signify, whether you
retained them or not?&nbsp; In cases where you might have been
foolish without peril you were wise; when nonsense and bigotry
threaten you with destruction, it is impossible to bring you back
to the alphabet of justice and common sense.&nbsp; If men are to
be fools, I would rather they were fools in little matters than
in great; dulness turned up with temerity is a livery all the
worse for the facings; and the most tremendous of all things is
the magnanimity of the dunce.</p>
<p>It is not by any means necessary, as you contend, to repeal
the Test Act if you give relief to the Catholic: what the
Catholics ask for is to be put on a footing with the Protestant
Dissenters, which would be done by repealing that part of the law
which compels them to take the oath of supremacy and to make the
declaration against transubstantiation: they would then come into
Parliament as all other Dissenters are allowed to do, and the
penal laws to which they were exposed for taking office would be
suspended every year, as they have been for this half century
past towards Protestant Dissenters.&nbsp; Perhaps, after all,
this is the best method&mdash;to continue the persecuting law,
and to suspend it every year&mdash;a method which, while it
effectually destroys the persecution itself, leaves to the great
mass of mankind the exquisite gratification of supposing that
they are enjoying some advantage from which a particular class of
their fellow creatures are excluded.&nbsp; We manage the
Corporation and Test Acts at present much in the same manner as
if we were to persuade parish boys who had been in the habit of
beating an ass to spare the animal, and beat the skin of an ass
stuffed with straw; this would preserve the semblance of
tormenting without the reality, and keep boy and beast in good
humour.</p>
<p>How can you imagine that a provision for the Catholic clergy
affects the 5th article of the Union?&nbsp; Surely I am
preserving the Protestant Church in Ireland if I put it in a
better condition than that in which it now is.&nbsp; A tithe
proctor in Ireland collects his tithes with a blunderbuss, and
carries his tenth hay-cock by storm, sword in hand: to give him
equal value in a more pacific shape cannot, I should imagine, be
considered as injurious to the Church of Ireland; and what right
has that Church to complain if Parliament chooses to fix upon the
empire the burden of supporting a double ecclesiastical
establishment?&nbsp; Are the revenues of the Irish Protestant
clergy in the slightest degree injured by such provision?&nbsp;
On the contrary, is it possible to confer a more serious benefit
upon that Church than by quieting and contenting those who are at
work for its destruction?</p>
<p>It is impossible to think of the affairs of Ireland without
being forcibly struck with the parallel of Hungary.&nbsp; Of her
seven millions of inhabitants, one half were Protestants,
Calvinists, and Lutherans, many of the Greek Church, and many
Jews: such was the state of their religious dissensions that
Mahomet had often been called in to the aid of Calvin, and the
crescent often glittered on the walls of Buda and Presburg.&nbsp;
At last, in 1791, during the most violent crisis of disturbance,
a Diet was called, and by a great majority of voices a decree was
passed, which secured to all the contending sects the fullest and
freest exercise of religious worship and education;
ordained&mdash;let it be heard in Hampstead&mdash;that churches
and chapels should be erected for all on the most perfectly equal
terms; that the Protestants of both confessions should depend
upon their spiritual superiors alone; liberated them from
swearing by the usual oath, &ldquo;the Holy Virgin Mary, the
saints, and chosen of God;&rdquo; and then the decree adds,
&ldquo;that <i>public offices and honours</i>, <i>high or
low</i>, <i>great or small</i>, <i>shall be given to natural-born
Hungarians who deserve well of their country</i>, <i>and possess
the other qualifications</i>, <i>let their religion be what it
may</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such was the line of policy pursued in a
Diet consisting of four hundred members, in a state whose form of
government approaches nearer to our own than any other, having a
Roman Catholic establishment of great wealth and power, and under
the influence of one of the most bigoted Catholic Courts in
Europe.&nbsp; This measure has now the experience of eighteen
years in its favour; it has undergone a trial of fourteen years
of revolution such as the world never witnessed, and more than
equal to a century less convulsed: What have been its
effects?&nbsp; When the French advanced like a torrent within a
few days&rsquo; march of Vienna, the Hungarians rose in a mass;
they formed what they called the sacred insurrection, to defend
their sovereign, their rights and liberties, now common to all;
and the apprehension of their approach dictated to the reluctant
Bonaparte the immediate signature of the treaty of
<i>Leoben</i>.&nbsp; The Romish hierarchy of Hungary exists in
all its former splendour and opulence; never has the slightest
attempt been made to diminish it; and those revolutionary
principles, to which so large a portion of civilised Europe has
been sacrificed, have here failed in making the smallest
successful inroad.</p>
<p>The whole history of this proceeding of the Hungarian Diet is
so extraordinary, and such an admirable comment upon the
Protestantism of Mr. Spencer Perceval, that I must compel you to
read a few short extracts from the law itself:&mdash;&ldquo;The
Protestants of both confessions shall, in religious matters,
depend upon their own spiritual superiors alone.&nbsp; The
Protestants may likewise retain their trivial and grammar
schools.&nbsp; The Church dues which the Protestants have
hitherto paid to the Catholic parish priests, schoolmasters, or
other such officers, either in money, productions, or labour,
shall in future entirely cease, and after three months from the
publishing of this law, be no more anywhere demanded.&nbsp; In
the building or repairing of churches, parsonage-houses, and
schools, the Protestants are not obliged to assist the Catholics
with labour, nor the Catholics the Protestants.&nbsp; The pious
foundations and donations of the Protestants which already exist,
or which in future may be made for their churches, ministers,
schools and students, hospitals, orphan houses, and poor, cannot
be taken from them under any pretext, nor yet the care of them;
but rather the unimpeded administration shall be intrusted to
those from among them to whom it legally belongs, and those
foundations which may have been taken from them under the last
government shall be returned to them without delay.&nbsp; All
affairs of marriage of the Protestants are left to their own
consistories; all landlords and masters of families, under the
penalty of public prosecution, are ordered not to prevent their
subjects and servants, whether they be Catholic or Protestant,
from the observance of the festivals and ceremonies of their
religion,&rdquo; etc. etc. etc.&mdash;By what strange chances are
mankind influenced!&nbsp; A little Catholic barrister of Vienna
might have raised the cry of <i>No Protestantism</i>, and Hungary
would have panted for the arrival of a French army as much as
Ireland does at this moment; arms would have been searched for;
Lutheran and Calvinist houses entered in the dead of the night;
and the strength of Austria exhausted in guarding a country from
which, under the present liberal system, she may expect in the
moment of danger the most powerful aid: and let it be remembered
that this memorable example of political wisdom took place at a
period when many great monarchies were yet unconquered in Europe;
in a country where the two religious parties were equal in
number; and where it is impossible to suppose indifference in the
party which relinquished its exclusive privileges.&nbsp; Under
all these circumstances the measure was carried in the Hungarian
Diet by a majority of 280 to 120.&nbsp; In a few weeks we shall
see every concession denied to the Catholics by a much larger
majority of Protestants, at a moment when every other power is
subjugated but ourselves, and in a country where the oppressed
are four times as numerous as their oppressors.&nbsp; So much for
the wisdom of our ancestors&mdash;so much for the nineteenth
century&mdash;so much for the superiority of the English over all
the nations of the Continent.</p>
<p>Are you not sensible, let me ask you, of the absurdity of
trusting the lowest Catholics with offices correspondent to their
situation in life, and of denying such privileges to the
higher.&nbsp; A Catholic may serve in the militia, but a Catholic
cannot come into Parliament; in the latter case you suspect
combination, and in the former case you suspect no combination;
you deliberately arm ten or twenty thousand of the lowest of the
Catholic people; and the moment you come to a class of men whose
education, honour, and talents seem to render all mischief less
probable, then you see the danger of employing a Catholic, and
cling to your investigating tests and disabling laws.&nbsp; If
you tell me you have enough of members of Parliament and not
enough of militia without the Catholics, I beg leave to remind
you that, by employing the physical force of any sect at the same
time when you leave them in a state of utter disaffection, you
are not adding strength to your armies, but weakness and
ruin.&nbsp; If you want the vigour of their common people, you
must not disgrace their nobility and insult their priesthood.</p>
<p>I thought that the terror of the Pope had been confined to the
limits of the nursery, and merely employed as a means to induce
young master to enter into his small-clothes with greater speed
and to eat his breakfast with greater attention to decorum.&nbsp;
For these purposes the name of the Pope is admirable; but why
push it beyond?&nbsp; Why not leave to Lord Hawkesbury all
further enumeration of the Pope&rsquo;s powers?&nbsp; For a whole
century you have been exposed to the enmity of France, and your
succession was disputed in two rebellions: what could the Pope do
at the period when there was a serious struggle whether England
should be Protestant or Catholic, and when the issue was
completely doubtful?&nbsp; Could the Pope induce the Irish to
rise in 1715?&nbsp; Could he induce them to rise in 1745?&nbsp;
You had no Catholic enemy when half this island was in arms; and
what did the Pope attempt in the last rebellion in Ireland?&nbsp;
But if he had as much power over the minds of the Irish as Mr.
Wilberforce has over the mind of a young Methodist converted the
preceding quarter, is this a reason why we are to disgust men who
may be acted upon in such a manner by a foreign power? or is it
not an additional reason why we should raise up every barrier of
affection and kindness against the mischief of foreign
influence?&nbsp; But the true answer is, the mischief does not
exist.&nbsp; Gog and Magog have produced as much influence upon
human affairs as the Pope has done for this half century past;
and by spoiling him of his possessions, and degrading him in the
eyes of all Europe, Bonaparte has not taken quite the proper
method of increasing his influence.</p>
<p>But why not a Catholic king as well as a Catholic member of
Parliament, or of the Cabinet?&mdash;Because it is probable that
the one would be mischievous and the other not.&nbsp; A Catholic
king might struggle against the Protestantism of the country, and
if the struggle were not successful it would at least be
dangerous; but the efforts of any other Catholic would be quite
insignificant, and his hope of success so small, that it is quite
improbable the effort would ever be made: my argument is, that in
so Protestant a country as Great Britain, the character of her
parliaments and her cabinet could not be changed by the few
Catholics who would ever find their way to the one or the
other.&nbsp; But the power of the Crown is immeasurably greater
than the power which the Catholics could obtain from any other
species of authority in the state; and it does not follow because
the lesser degree of power is innocent that the greater should be
so too.&nbsp; As for the stress you lay upon the danger of a
Catholic chancellor, I have not the least hesitation in saying
that his appointment would not do a ten thousandth part of the
mischief to the English Church that might be done by a
Methodistical chancellor of the true Clapham breed; and I request
to know if it is really so very necessary that a chancellor
should be of the religion of the Church of England, how many
chancellors you have had within the last century who have been
bred up in the Presbyterian religion?&nbsp; And again, how many
you have had who notoriously have been without any religion at
all?</p>
<p>Why are you to suppose that eligibility and election are the
same thing, and that all the cabinet <i>will</i> be Catholics
whenever all the cabinet <i>may</i> be Catholics?&nbsp; You have
a right, you say, to suppose an extreme case, and to argue upon
it&mdash;so have I: and I will suppose that the hundred Irish
members will one day come down in a body and pass a law
compelling the King to reside in Dublin.&nbsp; I will suppose
that the Scotch members, by a similar stratagem, will lay England
under a large contribution of meal and sulphur: no measure is
without objection if you sweep the whole horizon for danger; it
is not sufficient to tell me of what may happen, but you must
show me a rational probability that it will happen: after all, I
might, contrary to my real opinion, admit all your dangers to
exist; it is enough for me to contend that all other dangers
taken together are not equal to the danger of losing Ireland from
disaffection and invasion.</p>
<p>I am astonished to see you, and many good and well-meaning
clergymen beside you, painting the Catholics in such detestable
colours; two-thirds, at least, of Europe are Catholics&mdash;they
are Christians, though mistaken Christians; how can I possibly
admit that any sect of Christians, and, above all, that the
oldest and the most numerous sect of Christians are incapable of
fulfilling the common duties and relations of life: though I do
differ from them in many particulars, God forbid I should give
such a handle to infidelity, and subscribe to such blasphemy
against our common religion?</p>
<p>Do you think mankind never change their opinions without
formally expressing and confessing that change?&nbsp; When you
quote the decisions of ancient Catholic councils, are you
prepared to defend all the decrees of English convocations and
universities since the reign of Queen Elizabeth?&nbsp; I could
soon make you sick of your uncandid industry against the
Catholics, and bring you to allow that it is better to forget
times past, and to judge and be judged by present opinions and
present practice.</p>
<p>I must beg to be excused from explaining and refuting all the
mistakes about the Catholics made by my Lord Redesdale; and I
must do that nobleman the justice to say, that he has been
treated with great disrespect.&nbsp; Could anything be more
indecent than to make it a morning lounge in Dublin to call upon
his Lordship, and to cram him with Arabian-night stories about
the Catholics?&nbsp; Is this proper behaviour to the
representative of Majesty, the child of Themis, and the keeper of
the conscience in West Britain?&nbsp; Whoever reads the Letters
of the Catholic Bishops, in the appendix to Sir John
Hippesly&rsquo;s very sensible book, will see to what an excess
this practice must have been carried with the pleasing and
Protestant nobleman whose name I have mentioned, and from thence
I wish you to receive your answer about excommunication, and all
the trash which is talked against the Catholics.</p>
<p>A sort of notion has, by some means or another, crept into the
world that difference of religion would render men unfit to
perform together the offices of common and civil life: that
Brother Wood and Brother Grose could not travel together the same
circuit if they differed in creed, nor Cockell and Mingay be
engaged in the same cause, if Cockell was a Catholic and Mingay a
Muggletonian.&nbsp; It is supposed that Huskisson and Sir Harry
Englefield would squabble behind the Speaker&rsquo;s chair about
the council of Lateran, and many a turnpike bill miscarry by the
sarcastical controversies of Mr. Hawkins Brown and Sir John
Throckmorton upon the real presence.&nbsp; I wish I could see
some of these symptoms of earnestness upon the subject of
religion; but it really seems to me that, in the present state of
society, men no more think about inquiring concerning each
other&rsquo;s faith than they do concerning the colour of each
other&rsquo;s skins.&nbsp; There may have been times in England
when the quarter sessions would have been disturbed by
theological polemics; but now, after a Catholic justice had once
been seen on the bench, and it had been clearly ascertained that
he spoke English, had no tail, only a single row of teeth, and
that he loved port wine&mdash;after all the scandalous and
infamous reports of his physical conformation had been clearly
proved to be false&mdash;he would be reckoned a jolly fellow, and
very superior in flavour to a sly Presbyterian.&nbsp; Nothing, in
fact, can be more uncandid and unphilosophical than to say that a
man has a tail, because you cannot agree within him upon
religious subjects; it appears to be ludicrous: but I am
convinced it has done infinite mischief to the Catholics, and
made a very serious impression upon the minds of many gentlemen
of large landed property.</p>
<p>In talking of the impossibility of Catholic and Protestant
living together with equal privilege under the same government,
do you forget the Cantons of Switzerland?&nbsp; You might have
seen there a Protestant congregation going into a church which
had just been quitted by a Catholic congregation; and I will
venture to say that the Swiss Catholics were more bigoted to
their religion than any people in the whole world.&nbsp; Did the
kings of Prussia ever refuse to employ a Catholic?&nbsp; Would
Frederick the Great have rejected an able man on this
account?&nbsp; We have seen Prince Czartorinski, a Catholic
Secretary of State in Russia; in former times a Greek patriarch
and an apostolic vicar acted together in the most perfect harmony
in Venice; and we have seen the Emperor of Germany in modern
times intrusting the care of his person and the command of his
guard to a Protestant Prince, Frederick of Wittenberg.&nbsp; But
what are all these things to Mr. Perceval?&nbsp; He has looked at
human nature from the top of Hampstead Hill, and has not a
thought beyond the little sphere of his own vision.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The snail,&rdquo; say the Hindoos, &ldquo;sees nothing but
his own shell, and thinks it the grandest palace in the
universe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I now take a final leave of this subject of Ireland; the only
difficulty in discussing it is a want of resistance, a want of
something difficult to unravel, and something dark to
illumine.&nbsp; To agitate such a question is to beat the air
with a club, and cut down gnats with a scimitar; it is a
prostitution of industry, and a waste of strength.&nbsp; If a man
say, I have a good place, and I do not choose to lose it, this
mode of arguing upon the Catholic question I can well understand;
but that any human being with an understanding two degrees
elevated above that of an Anabaptist preacher, should
conscientiously contend for the expediency and propriety of
leaving the Irish Catholics in their present state, and of
subjecting us to such tremendous peril in the present condition
of the world, it is utterly out of my power to conceive.&nbsp;
Such a measure as the Catholic question is entirely beyond the
common game of politics; it is a measure in which all parties
ought to acquiesce, in order to preserve the place where and the
stake for which they play.&nbsp; If Ireland is gone, where are
jobs? where are reversions? where is my brother Lord Arden? where
are my dear and near relations?&nbsp; The game is up, and the
Speaker of the house of Commons will be sent as a present to the
menagerie at Paris.&nbsp; We talk of waiting from particular
considerations, as if centuries of joy and prosperity were before
us: in the next ten years our fate must be decided; we shall
know, long before that period, whether we can bear up against the
miseries by which we are threatened or not; and yet, in the very
midst of our crisis, we are enjoined to abstain from the most
certain means of increasing our strength, and advised to wait for
the remedy till the disease is removed by death or health.&nbsp;
And now, instead of the plain and manly policy of increasing
unanimity at home, by equalising rights and privileges, what is
the ignorant, arrogant, and wicked system which has been
pursued?&nbsp; Such a career of madness and of folly was, I
believe, never run in so short a period.&nbsp; The vigour of the
ministry is like the vigour of a grave-digger&mdash;the tomb
becomes more ready and more wide for every effort which they
make.&nbsp; There is nothing which it is worth while either to
take or to retain, and a constant train of ruinous expeditions
have been kept up.&nbsp; Every Englishman felt proud of the
integrity of his country; the character of the country is lost
for ever.&nbsp; It is of the utmost consequence to a commercial
people at war with the greatest part of Europe, that there should
be a free entry of neutrals into the enemy&rsquo;s ports; the
neutrals who earned our manufactures we have not only excluded,
but we have compelled them to declare war against us.&nbsp; It
was our interest to make a good peace, or convince our own people
that it could not be obtained; we have not made a peace, and we
have convinced the people of nothing but of the arrogance of the
Foreign Secretary: and all this has taken place in the short
space of a year, because a King&rsquo;s Bench barrister and a
writer of epigrams, turned into Ministers of State, were
determined to show country gentlemen that the late administration
had no vigour.&nbsp; In the meantime commerce stands still,
manufactures perish, Ireland is more and more irritated, India is
threatened, fresh taxes are accumulated upon the wretched people,
the war is carried on without it being possible to conceive any
one single object which a rational being can propose to himself
by its continuation; and in the midst of this unparalleled
insanity we are told that the Continent is to be reconquered by
the want of rhubarb and plums.&nbsp; A better spirit than exists
in the English people never existed in any people in the world:
it has been misdirected, and squandered upon party purposes in
the most degrading and scandalous manner; they have been led to
believe that they were benefiting the commerce of England by
destroying the commerce of America, that they were defending
their Sovereign by perpetuating the bigoted oppression of their
fellow-subjects; their rulers and their guides have told them
that they would equal the vigour of France by equalling her
atrocity; and they have gone on wasting that opulence, patience,
and courage, which, if husbanded by prudent and moderate
counsels, might have proved the salvation of mankind.&nbsp; The
same policy of turning the good qualities of Englishmen to their
own destruction, which made Mr. Pitt omnipotent, continues his
power to those who resemble him only in his vices; advantage is
taken of the loyalty of Englishmen to make them meanly
submissive; their piety is turned into persecution, their courage
into useless and obstinate contention; they are plundered because
they are ready to pay, and soothed into asinine stupidity because
they are full of virtuous patience.&nbsp; If England must perish
at last, so let it be: that event is in the hands of God; we must
dry up our tears and submit.&nbsp; But that England should perish
swindling and stealing; that it should perish waging war against
lazar houses and hospitals; that it should perish persecuting
with monastic bigotry; that it should calmly give itself up to be
ruined by the flashy arrogance of one man, and the narrow
fanaticism of another; these events are within the power of human
beings, and I did not think that the magnanimity of Englishmen
would ever stoop to such degradations.</p>

Catholics</span>.</h2>
<p><i>Historical Apology for The Irish Catholics</i>.&nbsp; By
<span class="smcap">William Parnell</span>, Esquire.&nbsp;
Fitzpatrick, Dublin.&nbsp; 1807.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> ever a nation exhibited symptoms
of downright madness, or utter stupidity, we conceive these
symptoms may be easily recognised in the conduct of this country
upon the Catholic question.&nbsp; A man has a wound in his great
toe, and a violent and perilous fever at the same time; and he
refuses to take the medicines for the fever because it will
disconcert the toe!&nbsp; The mournful and folly-stricken
blockhead forgets that his toe cannot survive him; that if he
dies, there can be no digital life apart from him: yet he lingers
and fondles over this last part of his body, soothing it madly
with little plasters, and anile fomentations, while the neglected
fever rages in his entrails, and burns away his whole life.&nbsp;
If the comparatively little questions of Establishment are all
that this country is capable of discussing or regarding, for
God&rsquo;s sake let us remember that the foreign conquest, which
destroys all, destroys this beloved <i>toe</i> also.&nbsp; Pass
over freedom, industry, and science&mdash;and look upon this
great empire, by which we are about to be swallowed up, only as
it affects the manner of collecting tithes, and of reading the
liturgy&mdash;still, if all goes, these must go too; and even,
for their interests, it is worth while to conciliate Ireland, to
avert the hostility, and to employ the strength of the Catholic
population.&nbsp; We plead the question as the sincerest friends
to the Establishment;&mdash;as wishing to it all the prosperity
and duration its warmest advocates can desire,&mdash;but
remembering always what these advocates seem to forget, that the
Establishment cannot be threatened by any danger so great as the
perdition of the kingdom in which it is established.</p>
<p>We are truly glad to agree so entirely with Mr. Parnell upon
this great question; we admire his way of thinking, and most
cordially recommend his work to the attention of the
public.&nbsp; The general conclusion which he attempts to prove
is this: that religious sentiment, however perverted by bigotry
or fanaticism, has always a <i>tendency</i> to moderation; that
it seldom assumes any great portion of activity or enthusiasm,
except from novelty of opinion, or from opposition, contumely,
and persecution, when novelty ceases; that a Government has
little to fear from any religious sect, except while that sect is
new.&nbsp; Give a Government only time, and, provided it has the
good sense to treat folly with forbearance, it must ultimately
prevail.&nbsp; When, therefore, a sect is found, after a lapse of
years, to be ill-disposed to the Government, we may be certain
that Government has widened its separation by marked
distinctions, roused its resentment by contumely, or supported
its enthusiasm by persecution.</p>
<p>The <i>particular</i> conclusion Mr. Parnell attempts to prove
is, that the Catholic religion in Ireland had sunk into torpor
and inactivity, till Government roused it with the lash: that
even then, from the respect and attachment which men are always
inclined to show towards government, there still remained a large
body of loyal Catholics; that these only decreased in number from
the rapid increase of persecution; and that, after all, the
effects which the resentment of the Roman Catholics had in
creating rebellions had been very much exaggerated.</p>
<p>In support of these two conclusions, Mr. Parnell takes a
survey of the history of Ireland, from the conquest under Henry
to the rebellion under Charles I., passing very rapidly over the
period which preceded the Reformation, and dwelling principally
upon the various rebellions which broke out in Ireland between
the Reformation and the grand rebellion in the reign of Charles
I.&nbsp; The celebrated conquest of Ireland by Henry II. extended
only to a very few counties in Leinster; nine-tenths of the whole
kingdom were left, as he found them, under the dominion of their
native princes.&nbsp; The influence of example was as strong in
this as in most other instances; and great numbers of the English
settlers who came over under various adventures resigned their
pretensions to superior civilisation, cast off their lower
garments, and lapsed into the nudity and barbarism of the
Irish.&nbsp; The limit which divided the possessions of the
English settler from those of the native Irish was called <i>the
pale</i>; and the expressions of inhabitants <i>within the
pale</i>, and <i>without the pale</i>, were the terms by which
the two nations were distinguished.&nbsp; It is almost
superfluous to state, that the most bloody and pernicious warfare
was carried on upon the borders&mdash;sometimes for something,
sometimes for nothing&mdash;most commonly for cows.&nbsp; The
Irish, over whom the sovereigns of England affected a sort of
nominal dominion, were entirely governed by their own laws, and
so very little connection had they with the justice of the
invading country, that it was as lawful to kill an Irishman as it
was to kill a badger or a fox.&nbsp; The instances are
innumerable, where the defendant has pleaded that the deceased
was an Irishman, and that therefore defendant had a right to kill
him&mdash;and upon the proof of Hibernicism, acquittal followed
of course.</p>
<p>When the English army mustered in any great strength, the
Irish chieftains would do exterior homage to the English Crown;
and they very frequently, by this artifice, averted from their
country the miseries of invasion: but they remained completely
unsubdued, till the rebellion which took place in the reign of
Queen Elizabeth, of which that politic woman availed herself to
the complete subjugation of Ireland.&nbsp; In speaking of the
Irish about the reign of Elizabeth or James I., we must not draw
our comparisons from England, but from New Zealand; they were not
civilised men, but savages; and if we reason about their conduct,
we must reason of them as savages.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;After reading every account of Irish
history,&rdquo; says Mr. Parnell, &ldquo;one great perplexity
appears to remain: How does it happen, that, from the first
invasion of the English till the reign of James I., Ireland seems
not to have made the smallest progress in civilisation or
wealth?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That it was divided into a number of small
principalities, which waged constant war on each other&mdash;or
that the appointment of the chieftains was elective&mdash;do not
appear sufficient reasons, although these are the only ones
assigned by those who have been at the trouble of considering the
subject: neither are the confiscations of property quite
sufficient to account for the effect.&nbsp; There have been great
confiscations in other countries, and still they have flourished;
the petty states of Greece were quite analogous to the chiefries,
as they were called, in Ireland; and yet they seemed to flourish
almost in proportion to their dissensions.&nbsp; Poland felt the
bad effects of an elective monarchy more than any other country;
and yet, in point of civilisation, it maintained a very
respectable rank among the nations of Europe; but Ireland never,
for an instant, made any progress in improvement, till the reign
of James I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is scarcely credible, that in a climate like that of
Ireland, and at a period so far advanced in civilisation as the
end of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, the greater part of the natives
should go naked.&nbsp; Yet this is rendered certain by the
testimony of an eye-witness, Fynes Moryson.&nbsp; &lsquo;In the
remote parts,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;where the English laws and
manners are unknown, the very chief of the Irish, as well men as
women, go naked in the winter time, only having their privy parts
covered with a rag of linen, and their bodies with a loose
mantle.&nbsp; This I speak of my own experience; yet remember
that a Bohemian baron coming out of Scotland to us by the north
parts of the wild Irish, told me in great earnestness, that he,
coming to the house of O&rsquo;Kane, a great lord amongst them,
was met at the door by sixteen women, all naked, excepting their
loose mantles, whereof eight or ten were very fair; with which
strange sight his eyes being dazzled, they led him into the
house, and then sitting down by the fire, with crossed legs, like
tailors, and so low as could not but offend chaste eyes, desired
him to sit down with them.&nbsp; Soon after, O&rsquo;Kane, the
lord of the country, came in all naked, except a loose mantle and
shoes, which he put off as soon as he came in; and, entertaining
the Baron after his best manner in the Latin tongue, desired him
to put off his apparel, which he thought to be a burden to him,
and to sit naked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To conclude, men and women at night going to
sleep, he thus naked in a round circle about the fire, with their
feet towards it.&nbsp; They fold their heads and their upper
parts in woollen mantles, first steeped in water to keep them
warm; for they say, that woollen cloth, wetted, preserves heat
(as linen, wetted, preserves cold), when the smoke of their
bodies has warmed the woollen cloth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cause of this extreme poverty, and of its long
continuance, we must conclude, arose from the peculiar laws of
property which were in force under the Irish dynasties.&nbsp;
These laws have been described by most writers as similar to the
Kentish custom of gavelkind; and, indeed, so little attention was
paid to the subject, that were it not for the researches of Sir
J. Davis, the knowledge of this singular usage would have been
entirely lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Brehon law of property, he tells us, was similar to
the custom (as the English lawyers term it) of hodge-podge.&nbsp;
When any one of the sept died, his lands did not descend to his
sons, but were divided among the whole sept: and, for this
purpose, the chief of the sept made a new division of the whole
lands belonging to the sept, and gave every one his part
according to seniority.&nbsp; So that no man had a property which
could descend to his children; and even during his own life his
possession of any particular spot was quite uncertain, being
liable to be constantly shuffled and changed by new
partitions.&nbsp; The consequence of this was that there was not
a house of brick or stone among the Irish down to the reign of
Henry VII.; not even a garden or orchard, or well-fenced or
improved field; neither village or town, or in any respect the
least provision for posterity.&nbsp; This monstrous custom, so
opposite to the natural feelings of mankind, was probably
perpetuated by the policy of the chiefs.&nbsp; In the first place
the power of partitioning being lodged in their hands, made them
the most absolute of tyrants, being the dispensers of the
property as well as of the liberty of their subjects.&nbsp; In
the second place, it had the appearance of adding to the number
of their savage armies; for where there was no improvement or
tillage, war was pursued as an occupation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the early history of Ireland, we find several
instances of chieftains discountenancing tillage; and so late as
Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, Moryson says, that &lsquo;Sir Neal Garve
restrained his people from ploughing, that they might assist him
to do any mischief.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;(pp. 99&ndash;102).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These quotations and observations will enable us to state a
few plain facts for the recollection of our English
readers:&mdash;1st, Ireland was never subdued till the rebellion
in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; 2nd, For four hundred
years before that period the two nations had been almost
constantly at war; and in consequence of this, a deep and
irreconcilable hatred existed between the people within and
without the pale.&nbsp; 3rd, The Irish, at the accession of Queen
Elizabeth, were unquestionably the most barbarous people in
Europe.&nbsp; So much for what had happened previous to the reign
of Queen Elizabeth; and let any man, who has the most superficial
knowledge of human affairs, determine whether national hatred,
proceeding from such powerful causes, could possibly have been
kept under by the defeat of one single rebellion&mdash;whether it
would not have been easy to have foreseen, at that period, that a
proud, brave, half-savage people, would cherish the memory of
their wrongs for centuries to come, and break forth into arms at
every period when they were particularly exasperated by
oppression, or invited by opportunity.&nbsp; If the Protestant
religion had spread in Ireland as it did in England, and if there
had never been any difference of faith between the two
countries&mdash;can it be believed that the Irish, ill-treated
and infamously governed as they have been, would never have made
any efforts to shake off the yoke of England?&nbsp; Surely there
are causes enough to account for their impatience of that yoke,
without endeavouring to inflame the zeal of ignorant people
against the Catholic religion, and to make that mode of faith
responsible for all the butchery which the Irish and English for
these last two centuries have exercised upon each other.&nbsp;
Everybody, of course, must admit, that if to the causes of hatred
already specified there be added the additional cause of
religious distinction, this last will give greater force (and
what is of more consequence to observe, give a <i>name</i>) to
the whole aggregate motive.&nbsp; But what Mr. Parnell contends
for, and clearly and decisively proves, is that many of those
sanguinary scenes attributed to the Catholic religion are to be
partly imputed to causes totally disconnected from religion; that
the unjust invasion, and the tyrannical, infamous policy of the
English, are to take their full share of blame with the sophisms
and plots of Catholic priests.&nbsp; In the reign of Henry VIII.,
Mr. Parnell shows that feudal submission was readily paid to him
by all the Irish chiefs; that the Reformation was received
without the slightest opposition; and that the troubles which
took place at that period in Ireland are to be entirely
attributed to the ambition and injustice of Henry.&nbsp; In the
reign of Queen Mary there was no recrimination upon the
Protestants&mdash;a striking proof that the bigotry of the
Catholic religion had not at that period risen to any great
height in Ireland.&nbsp; The insurrections of the various Irish
princes were as numerous during this reign as they had been in
the two preceding reigns&mdash;a circumstance rather difficult of
explanation, if, as is commonly believed, the Catholic religion
was at that period the main-spring of men&rsquo;s actions.</p>
<p>In the reign of Elizabeth, the Catholic in the pale regularly
fought against the Catholic out of the pale.&nbsp;
O&rsquo;Sullivan, a bigoted Papist, reproaches them with doing
so.&nbsp; Speaking of the reign of James I., he says, &ldquo;And
now the eyes even of the English Irish (the Catholics of the
pale) were opened; and they cursed their former folly for helping
the heretic.&rdquo;&nbsp; The English Government were so sensible
of the loyalty of the Irish English Catholics that they entrusted
them with the most confidential services.&nbsp; The Earl of
Kildare was the principal instrument in waging war against the
chieftains of Leix and Offal.&nbsp; William O&rsquo;Bourge,
another Catholic, was created Lord Castle Connel for his eminent
services; and MacGully Patrick, a priest, was the State
spy.&nbsp; We presume that this wise and <i>manly</i> conduct of
Queen Elizabeth was utterly unknown both to the Pastrycook and
the Secretary of State, who have published upon the dangers of
employing Catholics even against foreign enemies; and in those
publications have said a great deal about the wisdom of our
ancestors&mdash;the usual topic whenever the folly of their
descendants is to be defended.&nbsp; To whatever other of our
ancestors they may allude, they may spare all compliments to this
illustrious Princess, who would certainly have kept the worthy
confectioner to the composition of tarts, and most probably
furnished him with the productions of the Right Honourable
Secretary as the means of conveying those juicy delicacies to a
hungry and discerning public.</p>
<p>In the next two reigns, Mr. Parnell shows by what injudicious
measures of the English Government the spirit of Catholic
opposition was gradually formed; for that it did produce powerful
effects at a subsequent period he does not deny; but contends
only (as we have before stated) that these effects have been much
overrated, and ascribed <i>solely</i> to the Catholic religion
when other causes have at least had an equal agency in bringing
them about.&nbsp; He concludes with some general remarks on the
dreadful state of Ireland, and the contemptible folly and bigotry
of the English&mdash;remarks full of truth, of good sense, and of
political courage.&nbsp; How melancholy to reflect, that there
would be still some chance of saving England from the general
wreck of empires, but that it may not be saved, because one
politician will lose two thousand a year by it, and another three
thousand&mdash;a third a place in reversion, and a fourth a
pension for his aunt!&nbsp; Alas! these are the powerful causes
which have always settled the destiny of great kingdoms, and
which may level Old England, with all its boasted freedom, and
boasted wisdom, to the dust.&nbsp; Nor is it the least singular,
among the political phenomena of the present day, that the sole
consideration which seems to influence the unbigoted part of the
English people, in this great question of Ireland, is a regard
for the personal feelings of the Monarch.&nbsp; Nothing is said
or thought of the enormous risk to which Ireland is
exposed&mdash;nothing of the gross injustice with which the
Catholics are treated&mdash;nothing of the lucrative apostasy of
those from whom they experience this treatment: but the only
concern by which we all seem to be agitated is, that the King
must not be vexed in his old age.&nbsp; We have a great respect
for the King; and wish him all the happiness compatible with the
happiness of his people.&nbsp; But these are not times to pay
foolish compliments to kings, or the sons of kings, or to anybody
else; this journal (the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>) has always
preserved its character for courage and honesty; and it shall do
so to the last.&nbsp; If the people of this country are solely
occupied in considering what is personally agreeable to the King,
without considering what is for his permanent good, and for the
safety of his dominions; if all public men, quitting the common
vulgar scramble for emolument, do not concur in conciliating the
people of Ireland; if the unfounded alarms, and the comparatively
trifling interests of the clergy, are to supersede the great
question of freedom or slavery, it does appear to us quite
impossible that so mean and so foolish a people can escape that
destruction which is ready to burst upon them&mdash;a destruction
so imminent that it can only be averted by arming all in our
defence who would evidently be sharers in our ruin&mdash;and by
such a change of system as may save us from the hazard of being
ruined by the ignorance and cowardice of any general, by the
bigotry or the ambition of any minister, or by the well-meaning
scruples of any human being, let his dignity be what it
may.&nbsp; These minor and domestic dangers we must endeavour
firmly and temperately to avert as we best can; but at all
hazards we must keep out the destroyer from among us, or perish
like wise and brave men in the attempt.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">These</span> are all the late publications
that treat of Irish interests in general, and none of them are of
first-rate importance.&nbsp; Mr. Gamble&rsquo;s &ldquo;Travels in
Ireland&rdquo; are of a very ordinary description, low scenes and
low humour making up the principal part of the narrative.&nbsp;
There are readers, however, whom it will amuse; and the reading
market becomes more and more extensive, and embraces a greater
variety of persons every day.&nbsp; Mr. Whitelaw&rsquo;s
&ldquo;History of Dublin&rdquo; is a book of great accuracy and
research, highly creditable to the industry, good sense, and
benevolence of its author.&nbsp; Of the &ldquo;Travels&rdquo; of
Mr. Christian Curwen we hardly know what to say.&nbsp; He is bold
and honest in his politics, a great enemy to abuses, vapid in his
levity and pleasantry, and infinitely too much inclined to
declaim upon commonplace topics of morality and
benevolence.&nbsp; But, with these drawbacks, the book is not
ill-written, and may be advantageously read by those who are
desirous of information upon the present state of Ireland.</p>
<p>So great and so long has been the misgovernment of that
country, that we verily believe the empire would be much stronger
if everything was open sea between England and the Atlantic, and
if <i>skates and cod-fish</i> swam over the fair land of
Ulster.&nbsp; Such jobbing, such profligacy, so much direct
tyranny and oppression, such an abuse of God&rsquo;s gifts, such
a profanation of God&rsquo;s name for the purposes of bigotry and
party spirit, cannot be exceeded in the history of civilised
Europe, and will long remain a monument of infamy and shame to
England.&nbsp; But it will be more useful to suppress the
indignation which the very name of Ireland inspires, and to
consider impartially those causes which have marred this fair
portion of the creation, and kept it wild and savage in the midst
of improving Europe.</p>
<p>The great misfortune of Ireland is that the mass of the people
have been given up for a century to a handful of Protestants, by
whom they have been treated as <i>Helots</i>, and subjected to
every species of persecution and disgrace.&nbsp; The sufferings
of the Catholics have been so loudly chanted in the very streets,
that it is almost needless to remind our readers that, during the
reigns of George I. and George II., the Irish Roman Catholics
were disabled from holding any civil or military office, from
voting at elections, from admission into corporations, from
practising law or physic.&nbsp; A younger brother, by turning
Protestant, might deprive his elder brother of his birthright; by
the same process he might force his father, under the name of a
liberal provision, to yield up to him a part of his landed
property; and, if an eldest son, he might, in the same way,
reduce his father&rsquo;s fee-simple to a life-estate.&nbsp; A
Papist was disabled from purchasing freehold lands, and even from
holding long leases; and any person might take his Catholic
neighbour&rsquo;s house by paying &pound;5 for it.&nbsp; If the
child of a Catholic father turned Protestant he was taken away
from his father and put into the hands of a Protestant
relation.&nbsp; No Papist could purchase a freehold or lease for
more than thirty years, or inherit from an intestate Protestant,
nor from an intestate Catholic, nor dwell in Limerick or Galway,
nor hold an advowson, nor buy an annuity for life.&nbsp;
&pound;50 was given for discovering a Popish archbishop,
&pound;30 for a Popish clergyman, and 10s. for a
schoolmaster.&nbsp; No one was allowed to be trustee for
Catholics; no Catholic was allowed to take more than two
apprentices; no Papist to be solicitor, sheriff, or to serve on
Grand Juries.&nbsp; Horses of Papists might be seized for the
militia, for which militia Papists were to pay double, and to
find Protestant substitutes.&nbsp; Papists were prohibited from
being present at vestries, or from being high or petty
constables: and, when resident in towns, they were compelled to
find Protestant watchmen.&nbsp; Barristers and solicitors
marrying Catholics were exposed to the penalties of
Catholics.&nbsp; Persons plundered by privateers during a war
with any Popish prince were reimbursed by a levy on the Catholic
inhabitants where they lived.&nbsp; All Popish priests
celebrating marriages contrary to 12 Geo. I., cap 3, were to be
<i>hanged</i>!</p>
<p>The greater part of these incapacities are removed, though
many of a very serious and oppressive nature still remain.&nbsp;
But the grand misfortune is that the spirit which these
oppressive laws engendered remains.&nbsp; The Protestant still
looks upon the Catholic as a degraded being.&nbsp; The Catholic
does not yet consider himself upon an equality with his former
tyrant and taskmaster.&nbsp; That religious hatred which required
all the prohibiting vigilance of the law for its restraint has
found in the law its strongest support; and the spirit which the
law first exasperated and embittered continues to act long after
the original <i>stimulus</i> is withdrawn.&nbsp; The law which
prevented Catholics from serving on Grand Juries is repealed; but
Catholics are not called upon Grand Juries in the proportion in
which they are entitled by their rank and fortune.&nbsp; The Duke
of Bedford did all he could to give them the benefit of those
laws which are already passed in their favour.&nbsp; But power is
seldom entrusted in this country to one of the Duke of
Bedford&rsquo;s liberality, and everything has fallen back in the
hands of his successors into the ancient division of the
privileged and degraded castes.&nbsp; We do not mean to cast any
reflection upon the present Secretary for Ireland, whom we
believe to be upon this subject a very liberal politician, and on
all subjects an honourable and excellent man.&nbsp; The
Government under which he serves allows him to indulge in a
little harmless liberality; but it is perfectly understood that
nothing is intended to be done for the Catholics; that no loaves
and fishes will be lost by indulgence in Protestant insolence and
tyranny; and, therefore, among the generality of Irish
Protestants, insolence, tyranny, and exclusion continue to
operate.&nbsp; However eligible the Catholic may be, he is not
elected; whatever barriers may be thrown down, he does not
advance a step.&nbsp; He was first kept out by law; he is now
kept out by opinion and habit.&nbsp; They have been so long in
chains that nobody believes they are capable of using their hands
and feet.</p>
<p>It is not, however, the only or the worst misfortune of the
Catholics that the relaxations of the law are hitherto of little
benefit to them; the law is not yet sufficiently relaxed.&nbsp; A
Catholic, as everybody knows, cannot be made sheriff; cannot be
in parliament; cannot be a director of the Irish Bank; cannot
fill the great departments of the law, the army, and the navy; is
cut off from all the high objects of human ambition, and treated
as a marked and degraded person.</p>
<p>The common admission now is that the Catholics are to the
Protestants in Ireland as about four to one, of which Protestants
not more than <i>one half</i> belong to the Church of
Ireland.&nbsp; This, then, is one of the most striking features
in the state of Ireland.&nbsp; That the great mass of the
population is completely subjugated and overawed by a handful of
comparatively recent settlers, in whom all the power and
patronage of the country is vested, who have been reluctantly
compelled to desist from still greater abuses of authority, and
who look with trembling apprehension to the increasing liberality
of the parliament and the country towards these unfortunate
persons whom they have always looked upon as their property and
their prey.</p>
<p>Whatever evils may result from these proportions between the
oppressor and oppressed&mdash;to whatever dangers a country so
situated may be considered to be exposed, these evils and dangers
are rapidly increasing in Ireland.&nbsp; The proportion of
Catholics to Protestants is infinitely greater now than it was
thirty years ago, and is becoming more and more favourable to the
former.&nbsp; By a return made to the Irish House of Lords in
1732 the proportion of Catholics to Protestants was not two to
one.&nbsp; It is now (as we have already observed) four to one;
and the causes which have thus altered the proportions in favour
of the Catholics are sufficiently obvious to any one acquainted
with the state of Ireland.&nbsp; The Roman Catholic priest
resides; his income entirely depends upon the number of his
flock; and he must exert himself or he starves.&nbsp; There is
some chance of success, therefore, in <i>his</i> efforts to
convert; but the Protestant clergyman, if he were equally eager,
has little or no probability of persuading so much larger a
proportion of the population to come over to his Church.&nbsp;
The Catholic clergyman belongs to a religion that has always been
more desirous of gaining proselytes than the Protestant Church;
and he is animated by a sense of injury and a desire of
revenge.&nbsp; Another reason for the disproportionate increase
of Catholics is that the Catholics will marry upon means which
the Protestant considers as insufficient for marriage.&nbsp; A
few potatoes and a shed of turf are all that Luther has left for
the Romanist; and, when the latter gets these, he instantly
begins upon the great Irish manufacture of children.&nbsp; But a
Protestant belongs to the sect that eats the fine flour and
heaves the bran to others; he must have comforts, and he does not
marry till he gets them.&nbsp; He would be ashamed if he were
seen living as a Catholic lives.&nbsp; This is the principal
reason why the Protestants who remain attached to their Church do
not increase so fast as the Catholics.&nbsp; But in common minds,
daily scenes, the example of the majority, the power of
imitation, decide their habits, religious as well as civil.&nbsp;
A Protestant labourer who works among Catholics soon learns to
think and act and talk as they do; he is not proof against the
eternal panegyric which he hears of Father O&rsquo;Leary.&nbsp;
His Protestantism is rubbed away, and he goes at last, after some
little resistance, to the chapel where he sees everybody else
going.</p>
<p>These eight Catholics not only hate the ninth man, the
Protestant of the Establishment, for the unjust privileges he
enjoys&mdash;not only remember that the lands of their father
were given to his father&mdash;but they find themselves forced to
pay for the support of his religion.&nbsp; In the wretched state
of poverty in which the lower orders of Irish are plunged, it is
not without considerable effort that they can pay the few
shillings necessary for the support of their Catholic priest; and
when this is effected, a tenth of the potatoes in the garden are
to be set out for the support of a persuasion, the introduction
of which into Ireland they consider as the great cause of their
political inferiority, and all their manifold wretchedness.&nbsp;
In England a labourer can procure constant employment, or he can,
at the worst, obtain relief from his parish.&nbsp; Whether tithe
operates as a tax upon him, is known only to the political
economist: if he does pay it, he does not know that he pays it,
and the burden of supporting the Clergy is at least kept out of
his view.&nbsp; But in Ireland, the only method in which a poor
man lives is by taking a small portion of land in which he can
grow potatoes: seven or eight months out of twelve, in many parts
of Ireland, there is no constant employment of the poor; and the
potato farm is all that shelters them from absolute famine.&nbsp;
If the Pope were to come in person, seize upon every tenth
potato, the poor peasant would scarcely endure it.&nbsp; With
what patience, then, can he see it tossed into the cart of the
heretic rector, who has a church without a congregation, and a
revenue without duties?&nbsp; We do not say whether these things
are right or wrong, whether they want a remedy at all, or what
remedy they want; but we paint them in those colours in which
they appear to the eye of poverty and ignorance, without saying
whether those colours are false or true.&nbsp; Nor is the case at
all comparable to that of Dissenters paying tithe in England;
which case is precisely the reverse of what happens in Ireland,
for it is the contribution of a very small minority to the
religion of a very large majority; and the numbers on either side
make all the difference in the argument.&nbsp; To exasperate the
poor Catholic still more, the rich graziers of the parish, or the
squire in his parish, pay no tithe at all for their grass
land.&nbsp; Agistment tithe is abolished in Ireland, and the
burthen of supporting two Churches seems to devolve upon the
poorer Catholics, struggling with plough and spade in small
scraps of dearly-rented land.&nbsp; Tithes seem to be collected
in a more harsh manner than they are collected in England.&nbsp;
The minute sub-divisions of land in Ireland&mdash;the little
connection which the Protestant clergyman commonly has with the
Catholic population of his parish&mdash;have made the
introduction of tithe proctors very general, sometimes as the
agent of the clergyman, sometimes as the lessee or middleman
between the clergyman and the cultivator of the land, but, in
either case, practised, dexterous estimators of tithe.&nbsp; The
English clergymen in general are far from exacting the whole of
what is due to them, but sacrifice a little to the love of
popularity or to the dread of odium.&nbsp; A system of
tithe-proctors established all over England (as it is in
Ireland), would produce general disgust and alienation from the
Established Church.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;During the administration of Lord
Halifax,&rdquo; says Mr. Hardy, in quoting the opinion of Lord
Charlemont upon tithes paid by Catholics, &ldquo;Ireland was
dangerously disturbed in its southern and northern regions.&nbsp;
In the south principally, in the counties of Kilkenny, Limerick,
Cork, and Tipperary, the White Boys now made their first
appearance; those White Boys who have ever since occasionally
disturbed the public tranquillity, without any rational method
having been as yet pursued to eradicate this disgraceful
evil.&nbsp; When we consider that the very same district has been
for the long space of seven-and-twenty years liable to frequent
returns of the same disorder into which it has continually
relapsed, in spite of all the violent remedies from time to time
administered by our political quacks, we cannot doubt but that
some real, peculiar, and topical cause must exist, and yet
neither the removal, nor even the investigation of this cause,
has ever once been seriously attempted.&nbsp; Laws of the most
sanguinary and unconstitutional nature have been enacted; the
country has been disgraced and exasperated by frequent and bloody
executions; and the gibbet, that perpetual resource of weak and
cruel legislators, has groaned under the multitude of starving
criminals; yet, while the cause is suffered to exist, the effects
will ever follow.&nbsp; The amputation of limbs will never
eradicate a prurient humour, which must be sought in its source
and there remedied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; continues Mr. Wakefield, &ldquo;for the
sake of humanity and for the honour of the Irish character, that
the gentlemen of that country would take this matter into their
serious consideration.&nbsp; Let them only for a moment place
themselves in the situation of the half-famished cotter,
surrounded by a wretched family clamorous for food, and judge
what his feelings must be when he sees the tenth part of the
produce of his potato garden exposed at harvest time to public
<i>cant</i>, or if he have given a promissory note for the
payment of a certain sum of money to compensate for such tithe
when it becomes due, to hear the heart-rending cries of his
offspring clinging round him, and lamenting for the milk of which
they are deprived by the cows being driven to the pound to be
sold to discharge the debt.&nbsp; Such accounts are not the
creations of fancy; the facts do exist, and are but too common in
Ireland.&nbsp; Were one of them transferred to canvas by the hand
of genius, and exhibited to English humanity, that heart must be
callous indeed that could refuse its sympathy.&nbsp; I have seen
the cow, the favourite cow, driven away, accompanied by the
sighs, the tears, and the imprecations of a whole family, who
were paddling after, through wet and dirt, to take their last
affectionate farewell of this their only friend and benefactor at
the pound gate.&nbsp; I have heard with emotions which I can
scarcely describe, deep curses repeated from village to village
as the cavalcade proceeded.&nbsp; I have witnessed the group pass
the domain walls of the opulent grazier, whose numerous herds
were cropping the most luxuriant pastures, while he was secure
from any demand for the tithe of their food, looking on with the
most unfeeling indifference.&rdquo;&mdash;Ibid., p. 486.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Munster, where tithe of potatoes is exacted, risings
against the system have constantly occurred during the last forty
years.&nbsp; In Ulster, where no such tithe is required, these
insurrections are unknown.&nbsp; The double Church which Ireland
supports, and that painful visible contribution towards it which
the poor Irishman is compelled to make from his miserable
pittance, is one great cause of those never-ending insurrections,
burnings, murders, and robberies, which have laid waste that
ill-fated country for so many years.&nbsp; The unfortunate
consequence of the civil disabilities, and the Church payments
under which the Catholics labour, is a rooted antipathy to this
country.&nbsp; They hate the English Government from historical
recollection, actual suffering, and disappointed hope, and till
they are better treated they will continue to hate it.&nbsp; At
this moment, in a period of the most profound peace, there are
twenty-five thousand of the best disciplined and best appointed
troops in the world in Ireland, with bayonets fixed, presented
arms, and in the attitude of present war: nor is there a man too
much&mdash;nor would Ireland be tenable without them.&nbsp; When
it was necessary last year (or thought necessary) to put down the
children of reform, we were forced to make a new levy of troops
in this country; not a man could be spared from Ireland.&nbsp;
The moment they had embarked, Peep-of-Day Boys, Heart-of-Oak
Boys, Twelve-o&rsquo;-clock Boys, Heart-of-Flint Boys, and all
the bloody boyhood of the Bog of Allen, would have proceeded to
the ancient work of riot, rapine, and disaffection.&nbsp;
Ireland, in short, till her wrongs are redressed and a more
liberal policy is adopted towards her, will always be a cause of
anxiety and suspicion to this country, and in some moment of our
weakness and depression, will forcibly extort what she would now
receive with gratitude and exultation.</p>
<p>Ireland is situated close to another island of greater size,
speaking the same language, very superior in civilisation, and
the seat of government.&nbsp; The consequence of this is the
emigration of the richest and most powerful part of the
community&mdash;a vast drain of wealth&mdash;and the absence of
all that wholesome influence which the representatives of ancient
families, residing upon their estates, produce upon their
tenantry and dependents.&nbsp; Can any man imagine that the
scenes which have been acted in Ireland, within these last twenty
years, would have taken place, if such vast proprietors as the
Duke of Devonshire, the Marquis of Hertford, the Marquis of
Lansdowne, Earl Fitzwilliam, and many other men of equal wealth,
had been in the constant habit of residing upon their Irish as
they are upon their English estates?&nbsp; Is it of no
consequence to the order and the civilisation of a large
district, whether the great mansion is inhabited by an
insignificant, perhaps a mischievous attorney, in the shape of
agent, or whether the first and greatest men of the United
Kingdoms, after the business of Parliament is over, come with
their friends and families, to exercise hospitality, to spend
large revenues, to diffuse information, and to improve
manners?&nbsp; This evil is a very serious one to Ireland; and,
as far as we see, incurable.&nbsp; For if the present large
estates were, by the dilapidation of families, to be broken to
pieces and sold, others equally great would, in the free
circulation of property, speedily accumulate; and the moment any
possessor arrived at a certain pitch of fortune, he would
probably choose to reside in the better country&mdash;near the
Parliament, or the Court.</p>
<p>This absence of great proprietors in Ireland necessarily
brings with it, or if not necessarily, has actually brought with
it, the employment of the middlemen, which forms one other
standing and regular Irish grievance.&nbsp; We are well aware of
all that can be said in defence of middlemen; that they stand
between the little farmer and the great proprietor as the
shopkeeper does between the manufacturer and consumer; and, in
fact, by their intervention, save time, and therefore
expense.&nbsp; This may be true enough in the abstract; but the
particular nature of land must be attended to.&nbsp; The object
of the man who makes cloth is to sell his cloth at the present
market, for as high a price as he can obtain.&nbsp; If that price
is too high, it soon falls; but no injury is done to his
machinery by the superior price he has enjoyed for a
season&mdash;he is just as able to produce cloth with it, as if
the profits he enjoyed had always been equally moderate; he has
no fear, therefore, of the middleman, or of any species of moral
machinery which may help to obtain for him the greatest present
prices.&nbsp; The same would be the feeling of any one who let
out a steam-engine, or any other machine, for the purposes of
manufacture; he would naturally take the highest price he could
get; for he might either let his machine for a price
proportionate to the work it did, or the repairs, estimable with
the greatest precision, might be thrown upon the tenant; in
short, he could hardly ask any rent too high for his machine
which a responsible person would give; dilapidation would be so
visible, and so calculable in such instances, that any secondary
lease, or subletting, would be rather an increase of security
than a source of alarm.&nbsp; Any evil from such a practice would
be improbable measurable, and remediable.&nbsp; In land, on the
contrary, the object is not to get the highest prices absolutely,
but to get the highest prices which will not injure the
machine.&nbsp; One tenant may offer and pay double the rent of
another, and in a few years leave the land in a state which will
effectually bar all future offers of tenancy.&nbsp; It is of no
use to fill a lease full of clauses and covenants; a tenant who
pays more than he ought to pay, or who pays even to the last
farthing which he ought to pay, will rob the land, and injure the
machine, in spite of all the attorneys in England.&nbsp; He will
rob it even if he means to remain upon it&mdash;driven on by
present distress, and anxious to put off the day of defalcation
and arrear.&nbsp; The damage is often difficult of
detection&mdash;not easily calculated, not easily to be proved;
such for which juries (themselves perhaps farmers) will not
willingly give sufficient compensation.&nbsp; And if this be true
in England, it is much more strikingly true in Ireland, where it
is extremely difficult to obtain verdicts for breaches of
covenant in leases.</p>
<p>The only method, then, of guarding the machine from real
injury, is by giving to the actual occupier such advantage in his
contract, that he is unwilling to give it up&mdash;that he has a
real interest in retaining it, and is not driven by the
distresses of the present moment to destroy the future
productiveness of the soil.&nbsp; Any rent which the landlord
accepts more than this, or any system by which more rent than
this is obtained, is to borrow money upon the most usurious and
profligate interest&mdash;to increase the revenue of the present
day by the absolute ruin of the property.&nbsp; Such is the
effect produced by a middleman; he gives high prices that he may
obtain higher from the occupier; more is paid by the actual
occupier than is consistent with the safety and preservation of
the machine; the land is run out, and, in the end, that maximum
of rent we have described is not obtained; and not only is the
property injured by such a system, but in Ireland the most
shocking consequences ensue from it.&nbsp; There is little
manufacture in Ireland; the price of labour is low, the demand
for labour irregular.&nbsp; If a poor man be driven, by distress
of rent, from his potato garden, he has no other
resource&mdash;all is lost: he will do the impossible (as the
French say) to retain it; subscribe any bond, and promise any
rent.&nbsp; The middleman has no character to lose; and he knew,
when he took up the occupation, that it was one with which pity
had nothing to do.&nbsp; On he drives; and backward the poor
peasant recedes, loses something at every step, till he comes to
the very brink of despair; and then he recoils and murders his
oppressor, and is a <i>White Boy</i> or a <i>Right
Boy</i>;&mdash;the soldier shoots him, and the judge hangs
him.</p>
<p>In the debate which took place in the Irish House of Commons,
upon the Bill for preventing tumultuous risings and assemblies,
on the 31st of January, 1787, the Attorney-General submitted to
the House the following narrative of facts.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The commencement,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;was in one or two parishes in the county of Kerry; and
they proceeded thus.&nbsp; The people assembled in a Catholic
chapel, and there took an oath to obey the laws of Captain Right,
and to starve the clergy.&nbsp; They then proceeded to the next
parishes on the following Sunday, and there swore the people in
the same manner; with this addition, that they (the people last
sworn) should on the ensuing Sunday proceed to the chapels of
their next neighbouring parishes and swear the inhabitants of
those parishes in like manner.&nbsp; Proceeding in this manner,
they very soon went through the province of Munster.&nbsp; The
first object was the <i>reformation of tithes</i>.&nbsp; They
swore not to give more than a certain price per acre, not to
assist or allow them to be assisted in drawing the tithe, and to
permit <i>no proctor</i>.&nbsp; They next took upon them to
prevent the collection of parish cesses, next to nominate parish
clerks, and in some cases curates, to say what church should or
should not be repaired, and in one case to threaten that they
would burn a <i>new</i> church if the <i>old</i> one were not
given for a mass-house.&nbsp; At last they proceeded to regulate
the price of lands, to raise the price of labour, and to oppose
the collection of the hearth-money and other taxes.&nbsp; Bodies
of 5,000 of them have been seen to march through the country
unarmed, and, if met by any magistrate, <i>they never offered the
smallest rudeness or offence</i>; on the contrary, they had
allowed persons charged with crimes to be taken from amongst them
by the magistrate <i>alone</i>, unaided by any force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Attorney-General said he was well acquainted with
the province of Munster, and that it was impossible for human
wretchedness to <i>exceed that of the peasantry of that
province</i>.&nbsp; The unhappy tenantry were <i>ground to
powder</i> by relentless landlords; that, far from being able to
give the clergy their just dues, they had not food or raiment for
themselves&mdash;the landlord grasped the whole; and sorry was he
to add that, not satisfied with the present extortion, some
landlords had been so base as to instigate the insurgents to rob
the clergy of their tithes, not in order to alleviate the
distresses of the tenantry, but that they might add the
clergy&rsquo;s share to the cruel rack-rents they already
paid.&nbsp; The poor people of Munster lived in a <i>more abject
state of poverty than human nature could be supposed equal to
bear</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Grattan&rsquo;s Speeches,&rdquo;
vol. i., p. 292.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are not, of course, in such a discussion to be governed by
names.&nbsp; A middleman might be tied up by the strongest legal
restriction, as to the price he was to exact from the
under-tenants, and then he would be no more pernicious to the
estate than a steward.&nbsp; A steward might be protected in
exactions as severe as the most rapacious middleman; and then, of
course, it would be the same thing under another name.&nbsp; The
practice to which we object is the too common method in Ireland
of extorting the last farthing which the tenant is willing to
give for land rather than quit it: and the machinery by which
such practice is carried into effect is that of the
middleman.&nbsp; It is not only that it ruins the land; it ruins
the people also.&nbsp; They are made so poor&mdash;brought so
near the ground&mdash;that they can sink no lower; and burst out
at last into all the acts of desperation and revenge for which
Ireland is so notorious.&nbsp; Men who have money in their
pockets, and find that they are improving in their circumstances,
don&rsquo;t do these things.&nbsp; Opulence, or the hope of
opulence or comfort, is the parent of decency, order, and
submission to the laws.&nbsp; A landlord in Ireland understands
the luxury of carriages and horses, but has no relish for the
greater luxury of surrounding himself with a moral and grateful
tenantry.&nbsp; The absent proprietor looks only to revenue, and
cares nothing for the disorder and degradation of a country which
he never means to visit.&nbsp; There are very honourable
exceptions to this charge: but there are too many living
instances that it is just.&nbsp; The rapacity of the Irish
landlord induces him to allow of the extreme division of his
lands.&nbsp; When the daughter marries, a little portion of the
little farm is broken off&mdash;another corner for Patrick, and
another for Dermot&mdash;till the land is broken into sections,
upon one of which an English cow could not stand.&nbsp; Twenty
mansions of misery are thus reared instead of one.&nbsp; A louder
cry of oppression is lifted up to heaven, and fresh enemies to
the English name and power are multiplied on the earth.&nbsp; The
Irish gentleman, too, extremely desirous of political influence,
multiplying freeholds, and splitting votes; and this propensity
tends of course to increase the miserable redundance of living
beings, under which Ireland is groaning.&nbsp; Among the manifold
wretchedness to which the poor Irish tenant is liable, we must
not pass over the practice of driving for rent.&nbsp; A lets land
to B, who lets it to C, who lets it again to D.&nbsp; D pays C
his rent, and C pays B.&nbsp; But if B fails to pay A, the cattle
of B, C, D are all driven to the pound, and after the interval of
a few days sold by auction.&nbsp; A general driving of this kind
very frequently leads to a bloody insurrection.&nbsp; It may be
ranked among the classical grievances of Ireland.</p>
<p>Potatoes enter for a great deal into the present condition of
Ireland.&nbsp; They are much cheaper than wheat; and it is so
easy to rear a family upon them, that there is no cheek to
population from the difficulty of procuring food.&nbsp; The
population therefore goes on with a rapidity approaching almost
to that of new countries, and in a much greater ratio than the
improving agriculture and manufacturers of the country can find
employment for it.&nbsp; All degrees of all nations begin with
living in pig-styes.&nbsp; The king or the priest first gets out
of them; then the noble, then the pauper; in proportion as each
class becomes more and more opulent.&nbsp; Better tastes arise
from better circumstances; and the luxury of one period is the
wretchedness and poverty of another.&nbsp; English peasants, in
the time of Henry VII., were lodged as badly as Irish peasants
now are; but the population was limited by the difficulty of
procuring a corn subsistence.&nbsp; The improvements of this
kingdom were more rapid; the price of labour rose; and with it
the luxury and comfort of the peasant, who is now decently lodged
and clothed, and who would think himself in the last stage of
wretchedness if he had nothing but an iron pot in a turf house,
and plenty of potatoes in it.&nbsp; The use of the potato was
introduced into Ireland when the wretched accommodation of her
own peasantry bore some proportion to the state of those
accommodations all over Europe.&nbsp; But they have increased
their population so fast, and, in conjunction with the oppressive
government of Ireland retarding improvement, have kept the price
of labour so low, that the Irish poor have never been able to
emerge from their mud cabins, or to acquire any taste for
cleanliness and decency of appearance.&nbsp; Mr. Curwen has the
following description of Irish cottages:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;These mansions of miserable existence, for
so they may truly be described, conformably to our general
estimation of those indispensable comforts requisite to
constitute the happiness of rational beings, are most commonly
composed of two rooms on the ground floor, a most appropriate
term, for they are literally on the earth, the surface of which
is not unfrequently reduced a foot or more to save the expense of
so much outward walling.&nbsp; The one is a refectory, the other
the dormitory.&nbsp; The furniture of the former, if the owner
ranks in the upper part of the scale of scantiness, will consist
of a kitchen dresser, well provided and highly decorated with
crockery&mdash;not less apparently the pride of the husband than
the result of female vanity in the wife: which, with a table, a
chest, a few stools, and an iron pot, complete the catalogue of
conveniences generally found as belonging to the cabin: while a
spinning-wheel, furnished by the Linen Board, and a loom,
ornament vacant spaces that otherwise would remain
unfurnished.&nbsp; In fitting up the latter, which cannot on any
occasion or by any display add a feather to the weight or
importance expected to be excited by the appearance of the
former, the inventory is limited to one, and sometimes two beds,
serving for the repose of the whole family!&nbsp; However downy
these may be to limbs impatient for rest, their coverings appear
to be very slight, and the whole of the apartment created
reflections of a very painful nature.&nbsp; Under such
privations, with a wet mud floor and a roof in tatters, how idle
the search for comforts!&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Curwen</i>, <i>i.</i>,
pp. 112, 113.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this extract we shall add one more on the same subject.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The gigantic figure, bareheaded before me,
had a beard that would not have disgraced an ancient
Israelite&mdash;he was without shoes or stockings&mdash;and
almost a sans-culotte&mdash;with a coat, or rather a jacket, that
appeared as if the first blast of wind would tear it to
tatters.&nbsp; Though his garb was thus tattered, he had a manly
commanding countenance.&nbsp; I asked permission to see the
inside of his cabin, to which I received his most courteous
assent.&nbsp; On stooping to enter at the door I was stopped, and
found that permission from another was necessary before I could
be admitted.&nbsp; A pig, which was fastened to a stake driven
into the floor, with length of rope sufficient to permit him the
enjoyment of sun and air, demanded some courtesy, which I showed
him, and was suffered to enter.&nbsp; The wife was engaged in
boiling thread, and by her side, near the fire, a lovely infant
was sleeping, without any covering, on a bare board.&nbsp;
Whether the fire gave additional glow to the countenance of the
babe, or that Nature impressed on its unconscious cheek a blush
that the lot of man should be exposed to such privations, I will
not decide; but if the cause be referable to the latter, it was
in perfect unison with my own feelings.&nbsp; Two or three other
children crowded round the mother: on their rosy countenances
health seemed established in spite of filth and ragged
garments.&nbsp; The dress of the poor woman was barely sufficient
to satisfy decency.&nbsp; Her countenance bore the expression of
a set melancholy, tinctured with an appearance of ill
health.&nbsp; The hovel, which did not exceed twelve or fifteen
feet in length and ten in breadth, was half obscured by
smoke&mdash;chimney or window I saw none; the door served the
various purposes of an inlet to light and the outlet to
smoke.&nbsp; The furniture consisted of two stools, an iron pot,
and a spinning-wheel, while a sack stuffed with straw, and a
single blanket laid on planks, served as a bed for the repose of
the whole family.&nbsp; Need I attempt to describe my
sensations?&nbsp; The statement alone cannot fail of conveying to
a mind like yours an adequate idea of them&mdash;I could not long
remain a witness to this acme of human misery.&nbsp; As I left
the deplorable habitation the mistress followed me to repeat her
thanks for the trifle I had bestowed.&nbsp; This gave me an
opportunity of observing her person more particularly.&nbsp; She
was a tall figure, her countenance composed of interesting
features, and with every appearance of having once been
handsome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unwilling to quit the village without first satisfying
myself whether what I had seen was a solitary instance or a
sample of its general state, or whether the extremity of poverty
I had just beheld had arisen from peculiar improvidence and want
of management in one wretched family, I went into an adjoining
habitation, where I found a poor old woman of eighty, whose
miserable existence was painfully continued by the maintenance of
her granddaughter.&nbsp; Their condition, if possible, was more
deplorable.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Curwen</i>, i., pp.
181&ndash;183.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This wretchedness, of which all strangers who visit Ireland
are so sensible, proceeds certainly in great measure from their
accidental use of a food so cheap, that it encourages population
to an extraordinary degree, lowers the price of labour, and
leaves the multitudes which it calls into existence almost
destitute of everything but food.&nbsp; Many more live in
consequence of the introduction of potatoes; but all live in
greater wretchedness.&nbsp; In the progress of population, the
potato must of course become at last as difficult to be procured
as any other food; and then let the political economist calculate
what the immensity and wretchedness of a people must be, where
the further progress of population is checked by the difficulty
of procuring potatoes.</p>
<p>The consequence of the long mismanagement and oppression of
Ireland, and of the singular circumstances in which it is placed,
is, that it is a semi-barbarous country&mdash;more shame to those
who have thus ill-treated a fine country and a fine people; but
it is part of the present case of Ireland.&nbsp; The barbarism of
Ireland is evinced by the frequency and ferocity of
duels&mdash;the hereditary clannish feuds of the common people
and the fights to which they give birth&mdash;the atrocious
cruelties practised in the insurrections of the common
people&mdash;and their proneness to insurrection.&nbsp; The lower
Irish live in a state of greater wretchedness than any other
people in Europe inhabiting so fine a soil and climate.&nbsp; It
is difficult, often impossible, to execute the processes of
law.&nbsp; In cases where gentlemen are concerned, it is often
not even attempted.&nbsp; The conduct of under-sheriffs is often
very corrupt.&nbsp; We are afraid the magistracy of Ireland is
very inferior to that of this country; the spirit of jobbing and
bribery is very widely diffused, and upon occasions when the
utmost purity prevails in the sister kingdom.&nbsp; Military
force is necessary all over the country, and often for the most
common and just operations of Government.&nbsp; The behaviour of
the higher to the lower orders is much less gentle and decent
than in England.&nbsp; Blows from superiors to inferiors are more
frequent, and the punishment for such aggression more
doubtful.&nbsp; The word <i>gentleman</i> seems, in Ireland, to
put an end to most processes at law.&nbsp; Arrest a
gentleman!!!&mdash;take out a warrant against a
gentleman&mdash;are modes of operation not very common in the
administration of Irish justice.&nbsp; If a man strike the
meanest peasant in England, he is either knocked down in his
turn, or immediately taken before a magistrate.&nbsp; It is
impossible to live in Ireland without perceiving the various
points in which it is inferior in civilisation.&nbsp; Want of
unity in feeling and interest among the
people&mdash;irritability, violence, and revenge&mdash;want of
comfort and cleanliness in the lower orders&mdash;habitual
disobedience to the law&mdash;want of confidence in
magistrates&mdash;corruption, venality, the perpetual necessity
of recurring to military force&mdash;all carry back the observer
to that remote and early condition of mankind, which an
Englishman can learn only in the pages of the antiquary or the
historian.&nbsp; We do not draw this picture for censure but for
truth.&nbsp; We admire the Irish&mdash;feel the most sincere pity
for the state of Ireland&mdash;and think the conduct of the
English to that country to have been a system of atrocious
cruelty and contemptible meanness.&nbsp; With such a climate,
such a soil, and such a people, the inferiority of Ireland to the
rest of Europe is directly chargeable to the long wickedness of
the English Government.</p>
<p>A direct consequence of the present uncivilised state of
Ireland is, that very little English capital travels there.&nbsp;
The man who deals in steam-engines, and warps and woofs, is
naturally alarmed by Peep-of-Day Boys, and nocturnal Carders; his
object is to buy and sell as quickly and quietly as he can, and
he will naturally bear high taxes and rivalry in England, or
emigrate to any part of the Continent, or to America, rather than
plunge into the tumult of Irish politics and passions.&nbsp;
There is nothing which Ireland wants more than large
manufacturing towns to take off its superfluous population.&nbsp;
But internal peace must come first, and then the arts of peace
will follow.&nbsp; The foreign manufacturer will hardly think of
embarking his capital where he cannot be sure that his existence
is safe.&nbsp; Another check to the manufacturing greatness of
Ireland is the scarcity, not of coal, but of good coal, cheaply
raised&mdash;an article in which (in spite of papers in the Irish
Transactions) they are lamentably inferior to the English.</p>
<p>Another consequence from some of the causes we have stated is
the extreme idleness of the Irish labourer.&nbsp; There is
nothing of the value of which the Irish seem to have so little
notion as that of time.&nbsp; They scratch, pick, dawdle, stare,
gape, and do anything but strive and wrestle with the task before
them.&nbsp; The most ludicrous of all human objects is an
Irishman ploughing.&nbsp; A gigantic figure&mdash;a seven-foot
machine for turning potatoes in human nature&mdash;wrapt up in an
immense great-coat, and urging on two starved ponies, with
dreadful imprecations and uplifted shillala.&nbsp; The Irish crow
discerns a coming perquisite, and is not inattentive to the
proceedings of the steeds.&nbsp; The furrow which is to be the
depository of the future crop is not unlike, either in depth or
regularity, to those domestic furrows which the nails of the meek
and much-injured wife plough, in some family quarrel, upon the
cheeks of the deservedly punished husband.&nbsp; The weeds seem
to fall contentedly, knowing that they have fulfilled their
destiny, and left behind them, for the resurrection of the
ensuing spring, an abundant and healthy progeny.&nbsp; The whole
is a scene of idleness, laziness, and poverty, of which it is
impossible, in this active and enterprising country, to form the
most distant conception; but strongly indicative of habits,
whether secondary or original, which will long present a powerful
impediment to the improvement of Ireland.</p>
<p>The Irish character contributes something to retard the
improvements of that country.&nbsp; The Irishman has many good
qualities: he is brave, witty, generous, eloquent, hospitable,
and open-hearted; but he is vain, ostentatious, extravagant, and
fond of display, light in counsel, deficient in perseverance,
without skill in private or public economy, an enjoyer, not an
acquirer&mdash;one who despises the slow and patient
virtues&mdash;who wants the superstructure without the
foundation, the result without the previous operation, the oak
without the acorn and the three hundred years of
expectation.&nbsp; The Irish are irascible, prone to debt and to
fight, and very impatient of the restraints of law.&nbsp; Such a
people are not likely to keep their eyes steadily upon the main
chance like the Scotch or the Dutch.&nbsp; England strove very
hard at one period to compel the Scotch to pay a double Church,
but Sawney took his pen and ink, and finding what a sum it
amounted to became furious and drew his sword.&nbsp; God forbid
the Irishman should do the same!&nbsp; The remedy now would be
worse than the disease; but if the oppressions of England had
been more steadily resisted a century ago, Ireland would not have
been the scene of poverty, misery, and distress which it now
is.</p>
<p>The Catholic religion, among other causes, contributes to the
backwardness and barbarism of Ireland.&nbsp; Its debasing
superstition, childish ceremonies, and the profound submission to
the priesthood which it teaches, all tend to darken men&rsquo;s
minds, to impede the progress of knowledge and inquiry, and to
prevent Ireland from becoming as free, as powerful, and as rich
as the sister kingdom.&nbsp; Though sincere friends to Catholic
emancipation, we are no advocates for the Catholic
religion.&nbsp; We should be very glad to see a general
conversion to Protestantism among the Irish, but we do not think
that violence, privations, and incapacities, are the proper
methods of making proselytes.</p>
<p>Such, then, is Ireland at this period&mdash;a land more
barbarous than the rest of Europe, because it has been worse
treated and more cruelly oppressed.&nbsp; Many of the
incapacities and privations to which the Catholics were exposed
have been removed by law, but in such instances they are still
incapacitated and deprived by custom.&nbsp; Many cruel and
oppressive laws are still enforced against them.&nbsp; A tenth
part of the population engrosses all the honours of the country;
the other nine pay a tenth of the product of the earth for the
support of a religion in which they do not believe.&nbsp; There
is little capital in the country.&nbsp; The great and rich men
are called by business, or allured by pleasure, into England;
their estates are given up to factors, and the utmost farthing of
rent extorted from the poor, who, if they give up the land,
cannot get employment in manufactures, or regular employment in
husbandry.&nbsp; The common people use a sort of food so very
cheap that they can rear families who cannot procure employment,
and who have little more of the comforts of life than food.&nbsp;
The Irish are light-minded&mdash;want of employment has made them
idle; they are irritable and brave, have a keen remembrance of
the past wrongs they have suffered, and the present wrongs they
are suffering from England.&nbsp; The consequence of all this is,
eternal riot and insurrection, a whole army of soldiers in time
of profound peace, and general rebellion whenever England is busy
with her other enemies or off her guard!&nbsp; And thus it will
be, while the same causes continue to operate, for ages to come,
and worse and worse as the rapidly increasing population of the
Catholics becomes more and more numerous.</p>
<p>The remedies are time and justice, and that justice consists
in repealing all laws which make any distinction between the two
religions; in placing over the government of Ireland, not the
stupid, amiable, and insignificant noblemen who have too often
been sent there, but men who feel deeply the wrongs of Ireland,
and who have an ardent wish to heal them; who will take care that
Catholics, when eligible, shall be elected; who will share the
patronage of Ireland proportionally among the two parties, and
give to just and liberal laws the same vigour of execution which
has hitherto been reserved only for decrees of tyranny, and the
enactments of oppression.&nbsp; The injustice and hardship of
supporting two Churches must be put out of sight, if it cannot or
ought not to be cured.&nbsp; The political economist, the
moralist, and the satirist, must combine to teach moderation and
superintendence to the great Irish proprietors.&nbsp; Public talk
and clamour may do something for the poor Irish, as it did for
the slaves in the West Indies.&nbsp; Ireland will become more
quiet under such treatment, and then more rich, more comfortable,
and more civilised; and the horrid spectacle of folly and
tyranny, which it at present exhibits, may in time be removed
from the eyes of Europe.</p>
<p>There are two eminent Irishmen now in the House of
Commons&mdash;Lord Castlereagh and Mr. Canning&mdash;who will
subscribe to the justness of every syllable we have said upon
this subject, and who have it in their power, by making it the
condition of their remaining in office, to liberate their native
country, and raise it to its just rank among the nations of the
earth.&nbsp; Yet the Court buys them over, year after year, by
the pomp and perquisites of office; and year after year they come
into the House of Commons, feeling deeply, and describing
powerfully, the injuries of five millions of their
countrymen&mdash;and <i>continue</i> members of a government that
inflicts those evils, under the pitiful delusion that it is not a
Cabinet Question, as if the scratchings and quarrellings of Kings
and Queens could alone cement politicians together in
indissoluble unity, while the fate and torture of one-third of
the empire might be complimented away from one minister to
another, without the smallest breach in their Cabinet
alliance.&nbsp; Politicians, at least honest politicians, should
be very flexible and accommodating in little things, very rigid
and inflexible in great things.&nbsp; And is this <i>not</i> a
great thing?&nbsp; Who has painted it in finer and more
commanding eloquence than Mr. Canning?&nbsp; Who has taken a more
sensible and statesmanlike view of our miserable and cruel policy
than Lord Castlereagh?&nbsp; You would think, to hear them, that
the same planet could not contain them and the oppressors of
their country&mdash;perhaps not the same solar system.&nbsp; Yet
for money, claret, and patronage, they lend their countenance,
assistance, and friendship to the Ministers who are the stern and
inflexible enemies to the emancipation of Ireland!</p>
<p>Thank God that all is not profligacy and corruption in the
history of that devoted people&mdash;and that the name of
Irishman does not always carry with it the idea of the oppressor
or the oppressed&mdash;the plunderer or the plundered&mdash;the
tyrant or the slave!&nbsp; Great men hallow a whole people, and
lift up all who live in their time.&nbsp; What Irishman does not
feel proud that he has lived in the days of <span
class="smcap">Grattan</span>? who has not turned to him for
comfort, from the false friends and open enemies of Ireland? who
did not remember him in the days of its burnings and wastings and
murders?&nbsp; No Government ever dismayed him&mdash;the world
could not bribe him&mdash;he thought only of Ireland&mdash;lived
for no other object&mdash;dedicated to her his beautiful fancy,
his elegant wit, his manly courage, and all the splendour of his
astonishing eloquence.&nbsp; He was so born and so gifted that
poetry, forensic skill, elegant literature, and all the highest
attainments of human genius were within his reach; but he thought
the noblest occupation of a man was to make other men happy and
free; and in that straight line he went on for fifty years,
without one side-look, without one yielding thought, without one
motive in his heart which he might not have laid open to the view
of God and man.&nbsp; He is gone!&mdash;but there is not a single
day of his honest life of which every good Irishman would not be
more proud than of the whole political existence of his
countrymen&mdash;the annual deserters and betrayers of their
native land.</p>

Chieftain</i>; <i>with some Account of his Ancestors</i>.&nbsp;
Written by Himself.&nbsp; Fourth Edition.&nbsp; 12mo.&nbsp;
London, 1824.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> agreeable and witty book is
generally supposed to have been written by Mr. Thomas Moore, a
gentleman of small stature, but full of genius, and a steady
friend of all that is honourable and just.&nbsp; He has here
borrowed the name of a celebrated Irish leader, to typify that
spirit of violence and insurrection which is necessarily
generated by systematic oppression, and rudely avenges its
crimes; and the picture he has drawn of its prevalence in that
unhappy country is at once piteous and frightful.&nbsp; Its
effect in exciting our horror and indignation is in the long run
increased, we think&mdash;though at first it may seem
counteracted&mdash;by the tone of levity, and even jocularity,
under which he has chosen to veil the deep sarcasm and
substantial terrors of his story.&nbsp; We smile at first, and
are amused, and wonder, as we proceed, that the humorous
narrative should produce conviction and pity&mdash;shame,
abhorrence, and despair.</p>
<p>England seems to have treated Ireland much in the same way as
Mrs. Brownrigg treated her apprentice&mdash;for which Mrs.
Brownrigg is hanged in the first volume of the Newgate
Calendar.&nbsp; Upon the whole, we think the apprentice is better
off than the Irishman; as Mrs. Brownrigg merely starves and beats
her, without any attempt to prohibit her from going to any shop,
or praying at any church her apprentice might select: and once or
twice, if we remember rightly, Brownrigg appears to have felt
some compassion.&nbsp; Not so Old England, who indulges rather in
a steady baseness, uniform brutality, and unrelenting
oppression.</p>
<p>Let us select from this entertaining little book a short
history of dear Ireland, such as even some profligate idle member
of the House of Commons, voting as his master bids him, may
perchance throw his eye upon, and reflect for a moment upon the
iniquity to which he lends his support.</p>
<p>For some centuries after the reign of Henry II., the Irish
were killed like game, by persons qualified or unqualified.&nbsp;
Whether dogs were used does not appear quite certain, though it
is probable they were, spaniels as well as pointers; and that,
after a regular point by Basto, well backed by Ponto and
C&aelig;sar, Mr. O&rsquo;Donnel or Mr. O&rsquo;Leary bolted from
the thicket, and were bagged by the English sportsman.&nbsp; With
Henry II. came in tithes, to which, in all probability, about one
million of lives may have been sacrificed in Ireland.&nbsp; In
the reign of Edward I. the Irish who were settled near the
English requested that the benefit of the English laws might be
extended to them; but the remonstrance of the barons with the
hesitating king was in substance this: &ldquo;You have made us a
present of these wild gentlemen, and we particularly request that
no measures may be adopted to check us in that full range of
tyranny and oppression in which we consider the value of such a
gift to consist.&nbsp; You might as well give us sheep, and
prevent us from shearing the wool, or roasting the
meat.&rdquo;&nbsp; This reasoning prevailed, and the Irish were
kept to their barbarism, and the barons preserved their dive
stock.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Read &lsquo;Orange faction&rsquo; (says
Captain Rock) here and you have the wisdom of our rulers, at the
end of near six centuries, <i>in statu quo</i>.&nbsp; The grand
periodic year of the stoics, at the close of which everything was
to begin again, and the same events to be all reacted in the same
order, is, on a miniature scale, represented in the history of
the English Government in Ireland, every succeeding century being
but a new revolution of the same follies, the same crimes, and
the same turbulence that disgraced the former.&nbsp; But
&lsquo;Vive l&rsquo;ennemi!&rsquo; say I: whoever may suffer by
such measures, Captain Rock, at least, will prosper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And such was the result at the period of which I am
speaking.&nbsp; The rejection of a petition, so humble and so
reasonable, was followed, as a matter of course, by one of those
daring rebellions into which the revenge of an insulted people
naturally breaks forth.&nbsp; The M&rsquo;Cartys, the
O&rsquo;Briens, and the other Macs and O&rsquo;s, who have been
kept on the alert by similar causes ever since, flew to arms
under the command of a chieftain of my family; and, as the
proffered <i>handle</i> of the sword had been rejected, made
their inexorable masters at least feel its
<i>edge</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>pp.</i> 23&ndash;25.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fifty years afterwards the same request was renewed and
refused.&nbsp; Up again rose Mac and O, a <i>just and necessary
war</i> ensued; and after the usual murders, the usual chains
were replaced upon the Irishry.&nbsp; All Irishmen were excluded
from every species of office.&nbsp; It was high treason to marry
with the Irish blood, and highly penal to receive the Irish into
religious houses.&nbsp; War was waged also against their Thomas
Moores, Samuel Rogerses, and Walter Scotts, who went about the
country harping and singing against English oppression.&nbsp; No
such turbulent guests were to be received.&nbsp; The plan of
making them poets-laureate, or converting them to loyalty by
pensions of &pound;100 per annum, had not then been thought
of.&nbsp; They debarred the Irish even from the pleasure of
running away, and fixed them to the soil like negroes.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have thus selected,&rdquo; says the
historian of Rock, &ldquo;cursorily and at random, a few features
of the reigns preceding the Reformation, in order to show what
good use was made of those three or four hundred years in
attaching the Irish people to their English governors; and by
what a gentle course of alternatives they were prepared for the
inoculation of a new religion, which was now about to be
attempted upon them by the same skilful and friendly hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry VII. appears to have been the first monarch to
whom it occurred, that matters were not managed exactly as they
ought in this part of his dominions; and we find him&mdash;with a
simplicity which is still fresh and youthful among our
rulers&mdash;expressing his <i>surprise</i> that his subjects of
this land should be so prone to faction and rebellion, and that
so little advantage had been hitherto derived from the
acquisitions of his predecessor, notwithstanding the fruitfulness
and natural advantages of Ireland.&nbsp; Surprising, indeed, that
a policy, such as we have been describing, should not have
converted the whole country into a perfect Atlantis of
happiness&mdash;should not have made it like the imaginary island
of Sir Thomas More, where &lsquo;<i>tota insula velut una familia
est</i>!&rsquo;&mdash;most stubborn, truly, and ungrateful, must
that people be, upon whom, up to the very hour in which I write,
such a long and unvarying course of penal laws, confiscations,
and Insurrection Acts has been tried, without making them in the
least degree in love with their rulers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heloise tells her tutor, Abelard, that the correction
which he inflicted upon her only served to increase the ardour of
her affection for him; but bayonets and hemp are no such
&lsquo;<i>amoris stimuli</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; One more
characteristic anecdote of those times and I have done.&nbsp; At
the battle of Knocktow, in the reign of Henry VII., when that
remarkable man, the Earl of Kildare, assisted by the great
O&rsquo;Neal and other Irish chiefs, gained a victory over
Clanricard of Connaught, most important to the English
Government, Lord Gormanstown, after the battle, in the first
insolence of success, said, turning to the Earl of Kildare,
&lsquo;We have now slaughtered our enemies, but, to complete the
good deed, we must proceed yet further, and&mdash;cut the throats
of those Irish of our own party!&rsquo;&nbsp; Who can wonder that
the Rock family were active in those times?&rdquo;&mdash;(pp. 33,
35.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Henry VIII. persisted in all these outrages, and aggravated
them by insulting the prejudices of the people.&nbsp; England is
almost the only country in the world (even at present) where
there is not some favourite religious sport, where absurd lies,
little bits of cloth, feathers, rusty nails, splinters, and other
invaluable relics, are treasured up, and in defence of which the
whole population are willing to turn out and perish as one
man.&nbsp; Such was the shrine of St. Kieran, the whole treasures
of which the satellites of that corpulent tyrant turned out into
the street, pillaged the sacred church of Clonmacnoise, scattered
the holy nonsense of the priests to the winds, and burnt the real
and venerable crosier of St. Patrick, fresh from the
silversmith&rsquo;s shop, and formed of the most costly
materials.&nbsp; Modern princes change the uniform of regiments;
Henry changed the religion of kingdoms, and was determined that
the belief of the Irish should undergo a radical and Protestant
conversion.&nbsp; With what success this attempt was made, the
present state of Ireland is sufficient evidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be not dismayed,&rdquo; said Elizabeth, on hearing that
O&rsquo;Neal meditated some designs against her government;
&ldquo;tell my friends, if he arise, it will turn to their
advantage&mdash;<i>there will be estates for those who
want</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Soon after this prophetic speech, Munster
was destroyed by famine and the sword, and near 600,000 acres
forfeited to the crown, and distributed among Englishmen.&nbsp;
Sir Walter Raleigh (the virtuous and good) butchered the garrison
of Limerick in cold blood, after Lord Deputy Gray had selected
700 to be hanged.&nbsp; There were, during the reign of
Elizabeth, three invasions of Ireland by the Spaniards, produced
principally by the absurd measures of this princess for the
reformation of its religion.&nbsp; The Catholic clergy, in
consequence of these measures, abandoned their cures, the
churches fell to ruin, and the people were left without any means
of instruction.&nbsp; Add to these circumstances the murder of
M&rsquo;Mahon, the imprisonment of O&rsquo;Toole and
O&rsquo;Dogherty, and the kidnapping of O&rsquo;Donnel&mdash;all
truly Anglo-Hibernian proceedings.&nbsp; The execution of the
laws was rendered detestable and intolerable by the queen&rsquo;s
officers of justice.&nbsp; The spirit raised by these
transactions, besides innumerable smaller insurrections gave rise
to the great wars of Desmond and Hugh O&rsquo;Neal; which, after
they had worn out the ablest generals, discomfited the choicest
troops, exhausted the treasure, and embarrassed the operations of
Elizabeth, were terminated by the destruction of these two
ancient families, and by the confiscation of more than half the
territorial surface of the island.&nbsp; The last two years of
O&rsquo;Neal&rsquo;s wars cost Elizabeth &pound;140,000 per
annum, though the whole revenue of England at that period fell
considerably short of &pound;500,000.&nbsp; Essex, after the
destruction of Norris, led into Ireland an army of above 20,000
men, which was totally baffled and destroyed by Tyrone, within
two years of their landing.&nbsp; Such was the importance of
Irish rebellions two centuries before the time in which we
live.&nbsp; Sir G. Carew attempted to assassinate the Lugan
Earl&mdash;Mountjoy compelled the Irish rebels to massacre each
other.&nbsp; In the course of a few months 3,000 men were starved
to death in Tyrone.&nbsp; Sir Arthur Chichester, Sir Richard
Manson, and other commanders, saw three children feeding on the
flesh of their dead mother.&nbsp; Such were the golden days of
good Queen Bess!</p>
<p>By the rebellions of Dogherty, in the reign of James I., six
northern counties were confiscated, amounting to 500,000
acres.&nbsp; In the same manner, 64,000 acres were confiscated in
Athlone.&nbsp; The whole of his confiscations amount to nearly a
million acres; and if Leland means plantation acres, they
constitute a twelfth of the whole kingdom according to Newenham,
and a tenth according to Sir W. Petty.&nbsp; The most shocking
and scandalous action in the reign of James, was his attack upon
the whole property of the province of Connaught, which he would
have effected, if he had not been bought off by a sum greater
than he hoped to gain by his iniquity, besides the luxury of
confiscation.&nbsp; The Irish, during the reign of James I.,
suffered under the <i>double</i> evils of a licentious soldiery
and a religious persecution.</p>
<p>Charles I. took a bribe of &pound;120,000 from his Irish
subjects, to grant them what in those days were called
<i>Graces</i>, but in these days would be denominated the
Elements of Justice.&nbsp; The money was paid, but the graces
were never granted.&nbsp; One of these graces was curious enough:
&ldquo;That the clergy were not to be permitted to keep
henceforward any private prisons of their own, but delinquents
were to be committed to the public jails.&rdquo;&nbsp; The idea
of a rector, with his own private jail full of Dissenters, is the
most ludicrous piece of tyranny we ever heard of.&nbsp; The
troops in the beginning of Charles&rsquo;s reign were supported
by the weekly fines levied upon the Catholics for non-attendance
upon established worship.&nbsp; The Archbishop of Dublin went
himself at the head of a file of musketeers, to disperse a
Catholic congregation in Dublin&mdash;which object he effected
after a considerable skirmish with the priests.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
favourite object&rdquo; (says Dr. Leland, a Protestant clergyman,
and dignitary of the Irish Church) &ldquo;of the Irish Government
and the English Parliament, was <i>the utter extermination</i> of
all the Catholic inhabitants of Ireland.&rdquo;&nbsp; The great
rebellion took place in this reign, and Ireland was one scene of
blood and cruelty and confiscation.</p>
<p>Cromwell began his career in Ireland by massacring for five
days the garrison of Drogheda, to whom quarter had been
promised.&nbsp; Two millions and a half of acres were
confiscated.&nbsp; Whole towns were put up in lots, and
sold.&nbsp; The Catholics were banished from three-fourths of the
kingdom, and confined to Connaught.&nbsp; After a certain day,
every Catholic found out of Connaught was to be punished with
death.&nbsp; Fleetwood complains peevishly &ldquo;that the people
<i>do not transport readily</i>,&rdquo; but adds, &ldquo;<i>it is
doubtless a work in which the Lord will appear</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ten thousand Irish were sent as recruits to the Spanish army.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Such was <i>Cromwell&rsquo;s</i> way of
settling the affairs of Ireland; and if a nation <i>is</i> to be
ruined, this method is, perhaps, as good as any.&nbsp; It is, at
least, more humane than the slow, lingering process of exclusion,
disappointment, and degradation, by which their hearts are worn
out under more specious forms of tyranny; and that talent of
despatch which Moli&egrave;re attributes to one of his physicians
is no ordinary merit in a practitioner like
Cromwell:&mdash;&ldquo;C&rsquo;est un homme exp&eacute;ditif, qui
aime &agrave; dep&ecirc;cher ses malades; et quand on &agrave;
mourir, cela se fait avec lui le plus vite du monde.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A certain military Duke, who complains that Ireland is but half
conquered, would, no doubt, upon an emergency, try his hand in
the same line of practice, and, like that &lsquo;stern
hero&rsquo; Mirmillo, in the Dispensary,</p>
<p>&ldquo;While others meanly take whole months to slay,<br />
Despatch the grateful patient in a day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among other amiable enactments against the Catholics at
this period, the price of five pounds was set on the head of a
Romish priest, being exactly the same sum offered by the same
legislators for the head of a wolf.&nbsp; The Athenians, we are
told, encouraged the destruction of wolves by a similar reward
(five drachms); but it does not appear that these heathens bought
up the heads of priests at the same rate, such zeal in the cause
of religion being reserved for times of Christianity and
Protestantism.&rdquo;&mdash;(pp. 97&ndash;99.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing can show more strongly the light in which the Irish
were held by Cromwell than the correspondence with Henry Cromwell
respecting the peopling of Jamaica from Ireland.&nbsp; Secretary
Thurloe sends to Henry, the Lord Deputy in Ireland, to inform him
that &ldquo;a stock of Irish girls and Irish young men are
wanting for the peopling of Jamaica.&rdquo;&nbsp; The answer of
Henry Cromwell is as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Concerning the supply
of young men, although we must use force in taking them up,
<i>yet it being so much for their own good</i>, and likely to be
of so great advantage to the public, it is not the least doubted
but that you may have such a number of them as you may think fit
to make use of on this account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not need repeat anything respecting the girls,
not doubting to answer your expectations to the full <i>in
that</i>; and I think it might be of like advantage to your
affairs there and ours here if you should think fit to send 1,500
or 2,000 boys to the place above mentioned.&nbsp; <i>We can well
spare them</i>; and who knows but that it may be the means of
making them Englishmen&mdash;I mean, rather, Christians?&nbsp; As
for the girls, I suppose you will make provisions of clothes, and
other accommodations for them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon this, Thurloe
informs Henry Cromwell that the council have voted 4,000
<i>girls</i>, <i>and as many boys</i>, to go to Jamaica.</p>
<p>Every Catholic priest found in Ireland was hanged, and five
pounds paid to the informer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the years 1652 and 1653,&rdquo; says Colonel
Lawrence, in his <i>Interests of Ireland</i>, &ldquo;the plague
and famine had so swept away whole counties, that a man might
travel twenty or thirty miles and not see a living creature,
either man, or beast, or bird, they being all dead, or had
quitted those desolate places.&nbsp; Our soldiers would tell
stories of the places where they saw smoke&mdash;it was so rare
to see either smoke by day or fire or candle by
night.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this manner did the Irish live and die
under Cromwell, suffering by the sword, famine, pestilence, and
persecution, beholding the confiscation of a kingdom and the
banishment of a race.&nbsp; &ldquo;So that there perished,&rdquo;
says Sir W. Petty, &ldquo;in the year 1641, 650,000 human beings,
whose bloods somebody must atone for to God and the
King!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the reign of Charles II., by the Act of Settlement, four
millions and a half of acres were for ever taken from the
Irish.&nbsp; &ldquo;This country,&rdquo; says the Earl of Essex,
Lord Lieutenant in 1675, &ldquo;has been perpetually rent and
torn since his Majesty&rsquo;s restoration.&nbsp; I can compare
it to nothing better than the flinging the reward on the death of
a deer among the pack of hounds, where every one pulls and tears
where he can for himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; All wool grown in Ireland
was, by Act of Parliament, compelled to be sold to England; and
Irish cattle were excluded from England.&nbsp; The English,
however, were pleased to accept 30,000 head of cattle, sent as a
gift from Ireland to the sufferers in the great fire! and the
first day of the Sessions, after this act of munificence, the
Parliament passed fresh acts of exclusion against the productions
of that country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among the many anomalous situations in which the Irish
have been placed, by those &lsquo;marriage vows, false as
dicers&rsquo; oaths,&rsquo; which bind their country to England,
the dilemma in which they found themselves at the Revolution was
not the less perplexing or cruel.&nbsp; If they were loyal to the
King <i>de jure</i>, they were hanged by the King <i>de
facto</i>; and if they escaped with life from the King <i>de
facto</i>, it was but to be plundered and proscribed by the King
<i>de jure</i> afterwards.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hac <i>gener</i> atque <i>socer</i>
coeant mercede suorum.&rsquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Virgil</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In a manner so summary, prompt, and high
mettled,<br />
Twixt father and son-in-law matters were settled.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, most of the outlawries in Ireland were for
treason committed the very day on which the Prince and Princess
of Orange accepted the crown in the Banqueting-house; though the
news of this event could not possibly have reached the other side
of the Channel on the same day, and the Lord-Lieutenant of King
James, with an army to enforce obedience, was at that time in
actual possession of the government, so little was common sense
consulted, or the mere decency of forms observed, by that
rapacious spirit, which nothing less than the confiscation of the
whole island could satisfy; and which having, in the reign of
James I. and at the Restoration, despoiled the natives of no less
than ten millions six hundred and thirty-six thousand eight
hundred and thirty-seven acres, now added to its plunder one
million sixty thousand seven hundred and ninety-two acres more,
being the amount altogether (according to Lord Clare&rsquo;s
calculation) of the whole superficial contents of the island!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thus, not only had <i>all</i> Ireland
suffered confiscation in the course of this century, but no
inconsiderable portion of it had been twice and even thrice
confiscated.&nbsp; Well might Lord Clare say, &lsquo;that the
situation of the Irish nation, at the Revolution, stands
unparalleled in the history of the inhabited
world.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; (pp. 111&ndash;113.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the Articles of Limerick, the Irish were promised the free
exercise of their religion; but from that period to the year
1788, every year produced some fresh penalty against that
religion, some liberty was abridged, some right impaired, or some
suffering increased.&nbsp; By acts in King William&rsquo;s reign,
they were prevented from being solicitors.&nbsp; No Catholic was
allowed to marry a Protestant; and any Catholic who sent a son to
Catholic countries for education was to forfeit all his
lands.&nbsp; In the reign of Queen Anne, any son of a Catholic
who chose to turn Protestant got possession of the father&rsquo;s
estate.&nbsp; No Papist was allowed to purchase freehold
property, or to take a lease for more than thirty years.&nbsp; If
a Protestant dies intestate, the estate is to go to the next
<i>Protestant</i> heir, though all to the tenth generation should
be Catholic.&nbsp; In the same manner, if a Catholic dies
intestate, his estate is to go to the next Protestant.&nbsp; No
Papist is to dwell in Limerick or Galway.&nbsp; No Papist is to
take an annuity for life.&nbsp; The widow of a Papist turning
Protestant to have a portion of the chattels of deceased in spite
of any will.&nbsp; Every Papist teaching schools to be presented
as a regular Popish convict.&nbsp; Prices of catching Catholic
priests, from 50s. to &pound;10, according to rank.&nbsp; Papists
are to answer all questions respecting other Papists, or to be
committed to jail for twelve months.&nbsp; No trust to be
undertaken for Papists.&nbsp; No Papist to be on Grand
Juries.&nbsp; Some notion may be formed of the spirit of those
times, from an order of the House of Commons, &ldquo;that the
Sergeant-at-Arms should take into custody all Papists that should
presume to come into <i>the gallery</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp;
(<i>Commons&rsquo; Journal</i>, vol. iii., fol. 976.)&nbsp;
During this reign the English Parliament legislated as absolutely
for Ireland as they do now for Rutlandshire, an evil not to be
complained of, if they had done it as justly.&nbsp; In the reign
of George I., the horses of Papists were seized for the militia,
and rode by Protestants; towards which the Catholics paid double,
and were compelled to find Protestant substitutes.&nbsp; They
were prohibited from voting at vestries, or being high or petty
constables.&nbsp; An act of the English Parliament in this reign
opens as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Whereas attempts have been lately
made to shake off the subjection of Ireland to the Imperial Crown
of these realms, be it enacted,&rdquo; etc. etc.&nbsp; In the
reign of George II. four-sixths of the population were cut off
from the right of voting at elections by the necessity under
which they were placed of taking the oath of supremacy.&nbsp;
Barristers and solicitors marrying Catholics are exposed to all
the penalties of Catholics.&nbsp; Persons robbed by privateers
during a war with a Catholic State are to be indemnified by a
levy on the Catholic inhabitants of the neighbourhood.&nbsp; All
marriages between Catholics and Protestants are annulled.&nbsp;
All Popish priests celebrating them are to be hanged.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This system&rdquo; (says Arthur Young) &ldquo;has no other
tendency than that of driving out of the kingdom all the personal
wealth of the Catholics, and extinguishing their industry within
it; and the face of the country, every object which presents
itself to travellers, tells him how effectually this has been
done.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Young&rsquo;s Tour in Ireland</i>, vol.
ii., p. 48.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Such is the history of Ireland&mdash;for we are now at our own
times; and the only remaining question is, whether the system of
improvement and conciliation begun in the reign of George III.
shall be pursued, and the remaining incapacities of the Catholics
removed, or all these concessions be made insignificant by an
adherence to that spirit of proscription which they professed to
abolish?&nbsp; Looking to the sense and reason of the thing, and
to the ordinary working of humanity and justice, when assisted,
as they are here, by self-interest and worldly policy, it might
seem absurd to doubt of the result.&nbsp; But looking to the
facts and the persons by which we are now surrounded, we are
constrained to say that we greatly fear that these incapacities
never will be removed till they are removed by fear.&nbsp; What
else, indeed, can we expect when we see them opposed by such
enlightened men as Mr. Peel&mdash;faintly assisted by men of such
admirable genius as Mr. Canning&mdash;when Royal Dukes consider
it as a compliment to the memory of their father to continue this
miserable system of bigotry and exclusion, when men act
ignominiously and contemptibly on this question, who do so on no
other question, when almost the only persons zealously opposed to
this general baseness and fatuity are a few Whigs and Reviewers,
or here and there a virtuous poet like Mr. Moore?&nbsp; We repeat
again, that the measure never will be effected but by fear.&nbsp;
In the midst of one of our just and necessary wars, the Irish
Catholics will compel this country to grant them a great deal
more than they at present require or even contemplate.&nbsp; We
regret most severely the protraction of the disease, and the
danger of the remedy; but in this way it is that human affairs
are carried on!</p>
<p>We are sorry we have nothing for which to praise
Administration on the subject of the Catholic question, but it is
but justice to say, that they have been very zealous and active
in detecting fiscal abuses in Ireland, in improving mercantile
regulations, and in detecting Irish jobs.&nbsp; The commission on
which Mr. Wallace presided has been of the greatest possible
utility, and does infinite credit to the Government.&nbsp; The
name of Mr. Wallace in any commission has now become a pledge to
the public that there is a real intention to investigate and
correct abuse.&nbsp; He stands in the singular predicament of
being equally trusted by the rulers and the ruled.&nbsp; It is a
new era in Government when such men are called into action; and
if there were not proclaimed and fatal limits to that ministerial
liberality, which, so far as it goes, we welcome without a grudge
and praise without a sneer, we might yet hope that, for the sake
of mere consistency, they might be led to falsify our
forebodings.&nbsp; But alas! there are motives more immediate,
and therefore irresistible; and the time is not yet come when it
will be believed easier to govern Ireland by the love of the many
than by the power of the few, when the paltry and dangerous
machinery of bigoted faction and prostituted patronage may be
dispensed with, and the vessel of the State be propelled by the
natural current of popular interests and the breath of popular
applause.&nbsp; In the meantime, we cannot resist the temptation
of gracing our conclusion with the following beautiful passage,
in which the author alludes to the hopes that were raised at
another great era of partial concession and liberality, that of
the revolution of 1782, when, also, benefits were conferred which
proved abortive because they were incomplete, and balm poured
into the wound, where the envenomed shaft was yet left to
rankle.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And here,&rdquo; says the gallant Captain
Rock, &ldquo;as the free confession of weakness constitutes the
chief charm and use of biography, I will candidly own that the
dawn of prosperity and concord which I now saw breaking over the
fortunes of my country, so dazzled and deceived my youthful eyes,
and so unsettled every hereditary notion of what I owed to my
name and family, that&mdash;shall I confess it&mdash;I even
hailed with pleasure the prospects of peace and freedom that
seemed opening around me; nay, was ready, in the boyish
enthusiasm of the moment, to sacrifice all my own personal
interest in all future riots and rebellions to the one bright,
seducing object of my country&rsquo;s liberty and repose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I contemplated such a man as the venerable
Charlemont, whose nobility was to the people like a fort over a
valley, elevated above them solely for their defence; who
introduced the polish of the courtier into the camp of the
freeman, and served his country with all that pure Platonic
devotion which a true knight in the time of chivalry proffered to
his mistress; when I listened to the eloquence of Grattan, the
very music of freedom, her first fresh matin song, after a long
night of slavery, degradation, and sorrow; when I saw the bright
offerings which he brought to the shrine of his
country&mdash;wisdom, genius, courage, and patience, invigorated
and embellished by all those social and domestic virtues, without
which the loftiest talents stand isolated in the moral waste
around them, like the pillars of Palmyra towering in a
wilderness!&mdash;when I reflected on all this, it not only
disheartened me for the mission of discord which I had
undertaken, but made me secretly hope that it might be rendered
unnecessary; and that a country which could produce such men and
achieve such a revolution, might yet&mdash;in spite of the joint
efforts of the Government and my family&mdash;take her rank in
the scale of nations, and be happy!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father, however, who saw the momentary dazzle by
which I was affected, soon drew me out of this false light of
hope in which I lay basking, and set the truth before me in a way
but too convincing and ominous.&nbsp; &lsquo;Be not deceived,
boy,&rsquo; he would say, &lsquo;by the fallacious appearances
before you.&nbsp; Eminently great and good as is the man to whom
Ireland owes this short era of glory, <i>our</i> work, believe
me, will last longer than his.&nbsp; We have a power on our side
that &ldquo;will not willingly let us die;&rdquo; and, long after
Grattan shall have disappeared from earth like that arrow shot
into the clouds by Alcestes, effecting nothing, but leaving a
long train of light behind him, the family of the <span
class="smcap">Rocks</span> will continue to flourish in all their
native glory, upheld by the ever-watchful care of the
Legislature, and fostered by that &ldquo;nursing-mother of
Liberty,&rdquo; the Church.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
