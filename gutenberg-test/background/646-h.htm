<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>I was a boy when I went through the wonderful adventures 
herein set down.&nbsp; With the memory of my boyish feelings 
strong upon me, I present my book specially to boys, in the 
earnest hope that they may derive valuable information, much 
pleasure, great profit, and unbounded amusement from its 
pages.</p>
<p>One word more.&nbsp; If there is any boy or man who loves to 
be melancholy and morose, and who cannot enter with kindly 
sympathy into the regions of fun, let me seriously advise him to 
shut my book and put it away.&nbsp; It is not meant for him.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">RALPH ROVER</p>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p>The beginning&mdash;My early life and character&mdash;I thirst
for adventure in foreign lands and go to sea.</p>
<p>Roving has always been, and still is, my ruling passion, the 
joy of my heart, the very sunshine of my existence.&nbsp; In 
childhood, in boyhood, and in man&rsquo;s estate, I have been a 
rover; not a mere rambler among the woody glens and upon the 
hill-tops of my own native land, but an enthusiastic rover 
throughout the length and breadth of the wide wide world.</p>
<p>It was a wild, black night of howling storm, the night in 
which I was born on the foaming bosom of the broad Atlantic 
Ocean.&nbsp; My father was a sea-captain; my grandfather was a 
sea-captain; my great-grandfather had been a marine.&nbsp; Nobody
could tell positively what occupation <i>his</i> father had 
followed; but my dear mother used to assert that he had been a 
midshipman, whose grandfather, on the mother&rsquo;s side, had 
been an admiral in the royal navy.&nbsp; At anyrate we knew that,
as far back as our family could be traced, it had been intimately
connected with the great watery waste.&nbsp; Indeed this was the 
case on both sides of the house; for my mother always went to sea
with my father on his long voyages, and so spent the greater part
of her life upon the water.</p>
<p>Thus it was, I suppose, that I came to inherit a roving 
disposition.&nbsp; Soon after I was born, my father, being old, 
retired from a seafaring life, purchased a small cottage in a 
fishing village on the west coast of England, and settled down to
spend the evening of his life on the shores of that sea which had
for so many years been his home.&nbsp; It was not long after this
that I began to show the roving spirit that dwelt within 
me.&nbsp; For some time past my infant legs had been gaining 
strength, so that I came to be dissatisfied with rubbing the skin
off my chubby knees by walking on them, and made many attempts to
stand up and walk like a man; all of which attempts, however, 
resulted in my sitting down violently and in sudden 
surprise.&nbsp; One day I took advantage of my dear 
mother&rsquo;s absence to make another effort; and, to my joy, I 
actually succeeded in reaching the doorstep, over which I tumbled
into a pool of muddy water that lay before my father&rsquo;s 
cottage door.&nbsp; Ah, how vividly I remember the horror of my 
poor mother when she found me sweltering in the mud amongst a 
group of cackling ducks, and the tenderness with which she 
stripped off my dripping clothes and washed my dirty little 
body!&nbsp; From this time forth my rambles became more frequent,
and, as I grew older, more distant, until at last I had wandered 
far and near on the shore and in the woods around our humble 
dwelling, and did not rest content until my father bound me 
apprentice to a coasting vessel, and let me go to sea.</p>
<p>For some years I was happy in visiting the sea-ports, and in 
coasting along the shores of my native land.&nbsp; My Christian 
name was Ralph, and my comrades added to this the name of Rover, 
in consequence of the passion which I always evinced for 
travelling.&nbsp; Rover was not my real name, but as I never 
received any other I came at last to answer to it as naturally as
to my proper name; and, as it is not a bad one, I see no good 
reason why I should not introduce myself to the reader as Ralph 
Rover.&nbsp; My shipmates were kind, good-natured fellows, and 
they and I got on very well together.&nbsp; They did, indeed, 
very frequently make game of and banter me, but not unkindly; and
I overheard them sometimes saying that Ralph Rover was a 
&ldquo;queer, old-fashioned fellow.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, I must 
confess, surprised me much, and I pondered the saying long, but 
could come at no satisfactory conclusion as to that wherein my 
old-fashionedness lay.&nbsp; It is true I was a quiet lad, and 
seldom spoke except when spoken to.&nbsp; Moreover, I never could
understand the jokes of my companions even when they were 
explained to me: which dulness in apprehension occasioned me much
grief; however, I tried to make up for it by smiling and looking 
pleased when I observed that they were laughing at some witticism
which I had failed to detect.&nbsp; I was also very fond of 
inquiring into the nature of things and their causes, and often 
fell into fits of abstraction while thus engaged in my 
mind.&nbsp; But in all this I saw nothing that did not seem to be
exceedingly natural, and could by no means understand why my 
comrades should call me &ldquo;an old-fashioned 
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, while engaged in the coasting trade, I fell in with many 
seamen who had travelled to almost every quarter of the globe; 
and I freely confess that my heart glowed ardently within me as 
they recounted their wild adventures in foreign lands,&mdash;the 
dreadful storms they had weathered, the appalling dangers they 
had escaped, the wonderful creatures they had seen both on the 
land and in the sea, and the interesting lands and strange people
they had visited.&nbsp; But of all the places of which they told 
me, none captivated and charmed my imagination so much as the 
Coral Islands of the Southern Seas.&nbsp; They told me of 
thousands of beautiful fertile islands that had been formed by a 
small creature called the coral insect, where summer reigned 
nearly all the year round,&mdash;where the trees were laden with 
a constant harvest of luxuriant fruit,&mdash;where the climate 
was almost perpetually delightful,&mdash;yet where, strange to 
say, men were wild, bloodthirsty savages, excepting in those 
favoured isles to which the gospel of our Saviour had been 
conveyed.&nbsp; These exciting accounts had so great an effect 
upon my mind, that, when I reached the age of fifteen, I resolved
to make a voyage to the South Seas.</p>
<p>I had no little difficulty at first in prevailing on my dear 
parents to let me go; but when I urged on my father that he would
never have become a great captain had he remained in the coasting
trade, he saw the truth of what I said, and gave his 
consent.&nbsp; My dear mother, seeing that my father had made up 
his mind, no longer offered opposition to my wishes.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;But oh, Ralph,&rdquo; she said, on the day I bade her 
adieu, &ldquo;come back soon to us, my dear boy, for we are 
getting old now, Ralph, and may not have many years to 
live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I will not take up my reader&rsquo;s time with a minute 
account of all that occurred before I took my final leave of my 
dear parents.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, that my father placed me 
under the charge of an old mess-mate of his own, a merchant 
captain, who was on the point of sailing to the South Seas in his
own ship, the Arrow.&nbsp; My mother gave me her blessing and a 
small Bible; and her last request was, that I would never forget 
to read a chapter every day, and say my prayers; which I 
promised, with tears in my eyes, that I would certainly do.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards I went on board the Arrow, which was a fine 
large ship, and set sail for the islands of the Pacific 
Ocean.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p>The departure&mdash;The sea&mdash;My companions&mdash;Some 
account of the wonderful sights we saw on the great deep&mdash;A 
dreadful storm and a frightful wreck.</p>
<p>It was a bright, beautiful, warm day when our ship spread her 
canvass to the breeze, and sailed for the regions of the 
south.&nbsp; Oh, how my heart bounded with delight as I listened 
to the merry chorus of the sailors, while they hauled at the 
ropes and got in the anchor!&nbsp; The captain shouted&mdash;the 
men ran to obey&mdash;the noble ship bent over to the breeze, and
the shore gradually faded from my view, while I stood looking on 
with a kind of feeling that the whole was a delightful dream.</p>
<p>The first thing that struck me as being different from 
anything I had yet seen during my short career on the sea, was 
the hoisting of the anchor on deck, and lashing it firmly down 
with ropes, as if we had now bid adieu to the land for ever, and 
would require its services no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, lass,&rdquo; cried a broad-shouldered jack-tar, 
giving the fluke of the anchor a hearty slap with his hand after 
the housing was completed&mdash;&ldquo;there, lass, take a good 
nap now, for we shan&rsquo;t ask you to kiss the mud again for 
many a long day to come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was.&nbsp; That anchor did not &ldquo;kiss the 
mud&rdquo; for many long days afterwards; and when at last it 
did, it was for the last time!</p>
<p>There were a number of boys in the ship, but two of them were 
my special favourites.&nbsp; Jack Martin was a tall, strapping, 
broad-shouldered youth of eighteen, with a handsome, 
good-humoured, firm face.&nbsp; He had had a good education, was 
clever and hearty and lion-like in his actions, but mild and 
quiet in disposition.&nbsp; Jack was a general favourite, and had
a peculiar fondness for me.&nbsp; My other companion was Peterkin
Gay.&nbsp; He was little, quick, funny, decidedly mischievous, 
and about fourteen years old.&nbsp; But Peterkin&rsquo;s mischief
was almost always harmless, else he could not have been so much 
beloved as he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo! youngster,&rdquo; cried Jack Martin, giving me a
slap on the shoulder, the day I joined the ship, &ldquo;come 
below and I&rsquo;ll show you your berth.&nbsp; You and I are to 
be mess-mates, and I think we shall be good friends, for I like 
the look o&rsquo; you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was right.&nbsp; He and I and Peterkin afterwards became 
the best and stanchest friends that ever tossed together on the 
stormy waves.</p>
<p>I shall say little about the first part of our voyage.&nbsp; 
We had the usual amount of rough weather and calm; also we saw 
many strange fish rolling in the sea, and I was greatly delighted
one day by seeing a shoal of flying fish dart out of the water 
and skim through the air about a foot above the surface.&nbsp; 
They were pursued by dolphins, which feed on them, and one 
flying-fish in its terror flew over the ship, struck on the 
rigging, and fell upon the deck.&nbsp; Its wings were just fins 
elongated, and we found that they could never fly far at a time, 
and never mounted into the air like birds, but skimmed along the 
surface of the sea.&nbsp; Jack and I had it for dinner, and found
it remarkably good.</p>
<p>When we approached Cape Horn, at the southern extremity of 
America, the weather became very cold and stormy, and the sailors
began to tell stories about the furious gales and the dangers of 
that terrible cape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cape Horn,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;is the most horrible
headland I ever doubled.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve sailed round it twice 
already, and both times the ship was a&rsquo;most blow&rsquo;d 
out o&rsquo; the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve been round it once,&rdquo; said 
another, &ldquo;an&rsquo; that time the sails were split, and the
ropes frozen in the blocks, so that they wouldn&rsquo;t work, and
we wos all but lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve been round it five times,&rdquo; 
cried a third, &ldquo;an&rsquo; every time wos wuss than another,
the gales wos so tree-mendous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve been round it no times at all,&rdquo; 
cried Peterkin, with an impudent wink of his eye, 
&ldquo;an&rsquo; <i>that</i> time I wos blow&rsquo;d inside 
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we passed the dreaded cape without much rough 
weather, and, in the course of a few weeks afterwards, were 
sailing gently, before a warm tropical breeze, over the Pacific 
Ocean.&nbsp; Thus we proceeded on our voyage, sometimes bounding 
merrily before a fair breeze, at other times floating calmly on 
the glassy wave and fishing for the curious inhabitants of the 
deep,&mdash;all of which, although the sailors thought little of 
them, were strange, and interesting, and very wonderful to 
me.</p>
<p>At last we came among the Coral Islands of the Pacific, and I 
shall never forget the delight with which I gazed,&mdash;when we 
chanced to pass one,&mdash;at the pure, white, dazzling shores, 
and the verdant palm-trees, which looked bright and beautiful in 
the sunshine.&nbsp; And often did we three long to be landed on 
one, imagining that we should certainly find perfect happiness 
there!&nbsp; Our wish was granted sooner than we expected.</p>
<p>One night, soon after we entered the tropics, an awful storm 
burst upon our ship.&nbsp; The first squall of wind carried away 
two of our masts; and left only the foremast standing.&nbsp; Even
this, however, was more than enough, for we did not dare to hoist
a rag of sail on it.&nbsp; For five days the tempest raged in all
its fury.&nbsp; Everything was swept off the decks except one 
small boat.&nbsp; The steersman was lashed to the wheel, lest he 
should be washed away, and we all gave ourselves up for 
lost.&nbsp; The captain said that he had no idea where we were, 
as we had been blown far out of our course; and we feared much 
that we might get among the dangerous coral reefs which are so 
numerous in the Pacific.&nbsp; At day-break on the sixth morning 
of the gale we saw land ahead.&nbsp; It was an island encircled 
by a reef of coral on which the waves broke in fury.&nbsp; There 
was calm water within this reef, but we could only see one narrow
opening into it.&nbsp; For this opening we steered, but, ere we 
reached it, a tremendous wave broke on our stern, tore the rudder
completely off, and left us at the mercy of the winds and 
waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over with us now, lads,&rdquo; said the 
captain to the men; &ldquo;get the boat ready to launch; we shall
be on the rocks in less than half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men obeyed in gloomy silence, for they felt that there was
little hope of so small a boat living in such a sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come boys,&rdquo; said Jack Martin, in a grave tone, to
me and Peterkin, as we stood on the quarterdeck awaiting our 
fate;&mdash;&ldquo;Come boys, we three shall stick 
together.&nbsp; You see it is impossible that the little boat can
reach the shore, crowded with men.&nbsp; It will be sure to 
upset, so I mean rather to trust myself to a large oar, I see 
through the telescope that the ship will strike at the tail of 
the reef, where the waves break into the quiet water inside; so, 
if we manage to cling to the oar till it is driven over the 
breakers, we may perhaps gain the shore.&nbsp; What say you; will
you join me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We gladly agreed to follow Jack, for he inspired us with 
confidence, although I could perceive, by the sad tone of his 
voice, that he had little hope; and, indeed, when I looked at the
white waves that lashed the reef and boiled against the rocks as 
if in fury, I felt that there was but a step between us and 
death.&nbsp; My heart sank within me; but at that moment my 
thoughts turned to my beloved mother, and I remembered those 
words, which were among the last that she said to 
me&mdash;&ldquo;Ralph, my dearest child, always remember in the 
hour of danger to look to your Lord and Saviour Jesus 
Christ.&nbsp; He alone is both able and willing to save your body
and your soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I felt much comforted when I 
thought thereon.</p>
<p>The ship was now very near the rocks.&nbsp; The men were ready
with the boat, and the captain beside them giving orders, when a 
tremendous wave came towards us.&nbsp; We three ran towards the 
bow to lay hold of our oar, and had barely reached it when the 
wave fell on the deck with a crash like thunder.&nbsp; At the 
same moment the ship struck, the foremast broke off close to the 
deck and went over the side, carrying the boat and men along with
it.&nbsp; Our oar got entangled with the wreck, and Jack seized 
an axe to cut it free, but, owing to the motion of the ship, he 
missed the cordage and struck the axe deep into the oar.&nbsp; 
Another wave, however, washed it clear of the wreck.&nbsp; We all
seized hold of it, and the next instant we were struggling in the
wild sea.&nbsp; The last thing I saw was the boat whirling in the
surf, and all the sailors tossed into the foaming waves.&nbsp; 
Then I became insensible.</p>
<p>On recovering from my swoon, I found myself lying on a bank of
soft grass, under the shelter of an overhanging rock, with 
Peterkin on his knees by my side, tenderly bathing my temples 
with water, and endeavouring to stop the blood that flowed from a
wound in my forehead.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p>The Coral Island&mdash;Our first cogitations after landing, 
and the result of them&mdash;We conclude that the island is 
uninhabited.</p>
<p>There is a strange and peculiar sensation experienced in 
recovering from a state of insensibility, which is almost 
indescribable; a sort of dreamy, confused consciousness; a 
half-waking half-sleeping condition, accompanied with a feeling 
of weariness, which, however, is by no means disagreeable.&nbsp; 
As I slowly recovered and heard the voice of Peterkin inquiring 
whether I felt better, I thought that I must have overslept 
myself, and should be sent to the mast-head for being lazy; but 
before I could leap up in haste, the thought seemed to vanish 
suddenly away, and I fancied that I must have been ill.&nbsp; 
Then a balmy breeze fanned my cheek, and I thought of home, and 
the garden at the back of my father&rsquo;s cottage, with its 
luxuriant flowers, and the sweet-scented honey-suckle that my 
dear mother trained so carefully upon the trellised porch.&nbsp; 
But the roaring of the surf put these delightful thoughts to 
flight, and I was back again at sea, watching the dolphins and 
the flying-fish, and reefing topsails off the wild and stormy 
Cape Horn.&nbsp; Gradually the roar of the surf became louder and
more distinct.&nbsp; I thought of being wrecked far far away from
my native land, and slowly opened my eyes to meet those of my 
companion Jack, who, with a look of intense anxiety, was gazing 
into my face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak to us, my dear Ralph,&rdquo; whispered Jack, 
tenderly, &ldquo;are you better now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I smiled and looked up, saying, &ldquo;Better; why, what do 
you mean, Jack?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m quite well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what are you shamming for, and frightening us in 
this way?&rdquo; said Peterkin, smiling through his tears; for 
the poor boy had been really under the impression that I was 
dying.</p>
<p>I now raised myself on my elbow, and putting my hand to my 
forehead, found that it had been cut pretty severely, and that I 
had lost a good deal of blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Ralph,&rdquo; said Jack, pressing me gently
backward, &ldquo;lie down, my boy; you&rsquo;re not right 
yet.&nbsp; Wet your lips with this water, it&rsquo;s cool and 
clear as crystal.&nbsp; I got it from a spring close at 
hand.&nbsp; There now, don&rsquo;t say a word, hold your 
tongue,&rdquo; said he, seeing me about to speak.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it, but you must not utter a
syllable till you have rested well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t stop him from speaking, Jack,&rdquo; 
said Peterkin, who, now that his fears for my safety were 
removed, busied himself in erecting a shelter of broken branches 
in order to protect me from the wind; which, however, was almost 
unnecessary, for the rock beside which I had been laid completely
broke the force of the gale.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let him speak, Jack; 
it&rsquo;s a comfort to hear that he&rsquo;s alive, after lying 
there stiff and white and sulky for a whole hour, just like an 
Egyptian mummy.&nbsp; Never saw such a fellow as you are, Ralph; 
always up to mischief.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve almost knocked out all 
my teeth and more than half choked me, and now you go shamming 
dead!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very wicked of you, indeed it 
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Peterkin ran on in this style, my faculties became quite
clear again, and I began to understand my position.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;What do you mean by saying I half choked you, 
Peterkin?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I mean?&nbsp; Is English not your mother 
tongue, or do you want me to repeat it in French, by way of 
making it clearer?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you 
remember&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember nothing,&rdquo; said I, interrupting him, 
&ldquo;after we were thrown into the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p24b.jpg">
<img alt="Slowly recovering" src="images/p24s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Peterkin,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re 
exciting Ralph with your nonsense.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll explain it to
you.&nbsp; You recollect that after the ship struck, we three 
sprang over the bow into the sea; well, I noticed that the oar 
struck your head and gave you that cut on the brow, which nearly 
stunned you, so that you grasped Peterkin round the neck without 
knowing apparently what you were about.&nbsp; In doing so you 
pushed the telescope,&mdash;which you clung to as if it had been 
your life,&mdash;against Peterkin&rsquo;s mouth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pushed it against his mouth!&rdquo; interrupted 
Peterkin, &ldquo;say crammed it down his throat.&nbsp; Why, 
there&rsquo;s a distinct mark of the brass rim on the back of my 
gullet at this moment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, be that as it may,&rdquo; continued Jack, 
&ldquo;you clung to him, Ralph, till I feared you really would 
choke him; but I saw that he had a good hold of the oar, so I 
exerted myself to the utmost to push you towards the shore, which
we luckily reached without much trouble, for the water inside the
reef is quite calm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the captain and crew, what of them?&rdquo; I 
inquired anxiously.</p>
<p>Jack shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they lost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they are not lost, I hope, but I fear there is not 
much chance of their being saved.&nbsp; The ship struck at the 
very tail of the island on which we are cast.&nbsp; When the boat
was tossed into the sea it fortunately did not upset, although it
shipped a good deal of water, and all the men managed to scramble
into it; but before they could get the oars out the gale carried 
them past the point and away to leeward of the island.&nbsp; 
After we landed I saw them endeavouring to pull towards us, but 
as they had only one pair of oars out of the eight that belong to
the boat, and as the wind was blowing right in their teeth, they 
gradually lost ground.&nbsp; Then I saw them put about and hoist 
some sort of sail,&mdash;a blanket, I fancy, for it was too small
for the boat,&mdash;and in half an hour they were out of 
sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor fellows,&rdquo; I murmured sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the more I think about it, I&rsquo;ve better hope 
of them,&rdquo; continued Jack, in a more cheerful tone.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;You see, Ralph, I&rsquo;ve read a great deal about these 
South Sea Islands, and I know that in many places they are 
scattered about in thousands over the sea, so they&rsquo;re 
almost sure to fall in with one of them before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I hope so,&rdquo; said Peterkin, 
earnestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what has become of the wreck, 
Jack?&nbsp; I saw you clambering up the rocks there while I was 
watching Ralph.&nbsp; Did you say she had gone to 
pieces?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she has not gone to pieces, but she has gone to the
bottom,&rdquo; replied Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;As I said before, she 
struck on the tail of the island and stove in her bow, but the 
next breaker swung her clear, and she floated away to 
leeward.&nbsp; The poor fellows in the boat made a hard struggle 
to reach her, but long before they came near her she filled and 
went down.&nbsp; It was after she foundered that I saw them 
trying to pull to the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There wan a long silence after Jack ceased speaking, and I 
have no doubt that each was revolving in his mind our 
extraordinary position.&nbsp; For my part I cannot say that my 
reflections were very agreeable.&nbsp; I knew that we were on an 
island, for Jack had said so, but whether it was inhabited or not
I did not know.&nbsp; If it should be inhabited, I felt certain, 
from all I had heard of South Sea Islanders, that we should be 
roasted alive and eaten.&nbsp; If it should turn out to be 
uninhabited, I fancied that we should be starved to death.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;if the ship had only stuck on
the rocks we might have done pretty well, for we could have 
obtained provisions from her, and tools to enable us to build a 
shelter, but now&mdash;alas! alas! we are lost!&rdquo;&nbsp; 
These last words I uttered aloud in my distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost!&nbsp; Ralph?&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, while a smile
overspread his hearty countenance. &ldquo;Saved, you should have 
said.&nbsp; Your cogitations seem to have taken a wrong road, and
led you to a wrong conclusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what conclusion <i>I</i> have come 
to?&rdquo; said Peterkin.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have made up my mind 
that it&rsquo;s capital,&mdash;first rate,&mdash;the best thing 
that ever happened to us, and the most splendid prospect that 
ever lay before three jolly young tars.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got an 
island all to ourselves.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll take possession in the
name of the king; we&rsquo;ll go and enter the service of its 
black inhabitants.&nbsp; Of course we&rsquo;ll rise, naturally, 
to the top of affairs.&nbsp; White men always do in savage 
countries.&nbsp; You shall be king, Jack; Ralph, prime minister, 
and I shall be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The court jester,&rdquo; interrupted Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; retorted Peterkin, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have no
title at all.&nbsp; I shall merely accept a highly responsible 
situation under government, for you see, Jack, I&rsquo;m fond of 
having an enormous salary and nothing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose there are no natives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll build a charming villa, and plant a 
lovely garden round it, stuck all full of the most splendiferous 
tropical flowers, and we&rsquo;ll farm the land, plant, sow, 
reap, eat, sleep, and be merry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to be serious,&rdquo; said Jack, assuming a grave 
expression of countenance, which I observed always had the effect
of checking Peterkin&rsquo;s disposition to make fun of 
everything, &ldquo;we are really in rather an uncomfortable 
position.&nbsp; If this is a desert island, we shall have to live
very much like the wild beasts, for we have not a tool of any 
kind, not even a knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we have <i>that</i>,&rdquo; said Peterkin, 
fumbling in his trousers pocket, from which he drew forth a small
penknife with only one blade, and that was broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s better than nothing; but 
come,&rdquo; said Jack, rising, &ldquo;we are wasting our time in
<i>talking</i> instead of <i>doing</i>.&nbsp; You seem well 
enough to walk now, Ralph, let us see what we have got in our 
pockets, and then let us climb some hill and ascertain what sort 
of island we have been cast upon, for, whether good or bad, it 
seems likely to be our home for some time to come.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p>We examine into our personal property, and make a happy 
discovery&mdash;Our island described&mdash;Jack proves himself to
be learned and sagacious above his fellows&mdash;Curious 
discoveries&mdash;Natural lemonade!</p>
<p>We now seated ourselves upon a rock and began to examine into 
our personal property.&nbsp; When we reached the shore, after 
being wrecked, my companions had taken off part of their clothes 
and spread them out in the sun to dry, for, although the gale was
raging fiercely, there was not a single cloud in the bright 
sky.&nbsp; They had also stripped off most part of my wet clothes
and spread them also on the rocks.&nbsp; Having resumed our 
garments, we now searched all our pockets with the utmost care, 
and laid their contents out on a flat stone before us; and, now 
that our minds were fully alive to our condition, it was with no 
little anxiety that we turned our several pockets inside out, in 
order that nothing might escape us.&nbsp; When all was collected 
together we found that our worldly goods consisted of the 
following articles:&mdash;</p>
<p>First, A small penknife with a single blade broken off about 
the middle and very rusty, besides having two or three notches on
its edge.&nbsp; (Peterkin said of this, with his usual 
pleasantry, that it would do for a saw as well as a knife, which 
was a great advantage.)&nbsp; Second, An old German-silver 
pencil-case without any lead in it.&nbsp; Third, A piece of 
whip-cord about six yards long.&nbsp; Fourth, A sailmaker&rsquo;s
needle of a small size.&nbsp; Fifth, A ship&rsquo;s telescope, 
which I happened to have in my hand at the time the ship struck, 
and which I had clung to firmly all the time I was in the 
water.&nbsp; Indeed it was with difficulty that Jack got it out 
of my grasp when I was lying insensible on the shore.&nbsp; I 
cannot understand why I kept such a firm hold of this 
telescope.&nbsp; They say that a drowning man will clutch at a 
straw.&nbsp; Perhaps it may have been some such feeling in me, 
for I did not know that it was in my hand at the time we were 
wrecked.&nbsp; However, we felt some pleasure in having it with 
us now, although we did not see that it could be of much use to 
us, as the glass at the small end was broken to pieces.&nbsp; Our
sixth article was a brass ring which Jack always wore on his 
little finger.&nbsp; I never understood why he wore it, for Jack 
was not vain of his appearance, and did not seem to care for 
ornaments of any kind.&nbsp; Peterkin said &ldquo;it was in 
memory of the girl he left behind him!&rdquo;&nbsp; But as he 
never spoke of this girl to either of us, I am inclined to think 
that Peterkin was either jesting or mistaken.&nbsp; In addition 
to these articles we had a little bit of tinder, and the clothes 
on our backs.&nbsp; These last were as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Each of us had on a pair of stout canvass trousers, and a pair
of sailors&rsquo; thick shoes.&nbsp; Jack wore a red flannel 
shirt, a blue jacket, and a red Kilmarnock bonnet or night-cap, 
besides a pair of worsted socks, and a cotton 
pocket-handkerchief, with sixteen portraits of Lord Nelson 
printed on it, and a union Jack in the middle.&nbsp; Peterkin had
on a striped flannel shirt,&mdash;which he wore outside his 
trousers, and belted round his waist, after the manner of a 
tunic,&mdash;and a round black straw hat.&nbsp; He had no jacket,
having thrown it off just before we were cast into the sea; but 
this was not of much consequence, as the climate of the island 
proved to be extremely mild; so much so, indeed, that Jack and I 
often preferred to go about without our jackets.&nbsp; Peterkin 
had also a pair of white cotton socks, and a blue handkerchief 
with white spots all over it.&nbsp; My own costume consisted of a
blue flannel shirt, a blue jacket, a black cap, and a pair of 
worsted socks, besides the shoes and canvass trousers already 
mentioned.&nbsp; This was all we had, and besides these things we
had nothing else; but, when we thought of the danger from which 
we had escaped, and how much worse off we might have been had the
ship struck on the reef during the night, we felt very thankful 
that we were possessed of so much, although, I must confess, we 
sometimes wished that we had had a little more.</p>
<p>While we were examining these things, and talking about them, 
Jack suddenly started and exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The oar! we have forgotten the oar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good will that do us?&rdquo; said Peterkin; 
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s wood enough on the island to make a thousand
oars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, lad,&rdquo; replied Jack, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s 
a bit of hoop iron at the end of it, and that may be of much use 
to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;let us go fetch 
it;&rdquo; and with that we all three rose and hastened down to 
the beach.&nbsp; I still felt a little weak from loss of blood, 
so that my companions soon began to leave me behind; but Jack 
perceived this, and, with his usual considerate good nature, 
turned back to help me.&nbsp; This was now the first time that I 
had looked well about me since landing, as the spot where I had 
been laid was covered with thick bushes which almost hid the 
country from our view.&nbsp; As we now emerged from among these 
and walked down the sandy beach together, I cast my eyes about, 
and, truly, my heart glowed within me and my spirits rose at the 
beautiful prospect which I beheld on every side.&nbsp; The gale 
had suddenly died away, just as if it had blown furiously till it
dashed our ship upon the rocks, and had nothing more to do after 
accomplishing that.&nbsp; The island on which we stood was hilly,
and covered almost everywhere with the most beautiful and richly 
coloured trees, bushes, and shrubs, none of which I knew the 
names of at that time, except, indeed, the cocoa-nut palms, which
I recognised at once from the many pictures that I had seen of 
them before I left home.&nbsp; A sandy beach of dazzling 
whiteness lined this bright green shore, and upon it there fell a
gentle ripple of the sea.&nbsp; This last astonished me much, for
I recollected that at home the sea used to fall in huge billows 
on the shore long after a storm had subsided.&nbsp; But on 
casting my glance out to sea the cause became apparent.&nbsp; 
About a mile distant from the shore I saw the great billows of 
the ocean rolling like a green wall, and falling with a long, 
loud roar, upon a low coral reef, where they were dashed into 
white foam and flung up in clouds of spray.&nbsp; This spray 
sometimes flew exceedingly high, and, every here and there, a 
beautiful rainbow was formed for a moment among the falling 
drops.&nbsp; We afterwards found that this coral reef extended 
quite round the island, and formed a natural breakwater to 
it.&nbsp; Beyond this the sea rose and tossed violently from the 
effects of the storm; but between the reef and the shore it was 
as calm and as smooth as a pond.</p>
<p>My heart was filled with more delight than I can express at 
sight of so many glorious objects, and my thoughts turned 
suddenly to the contemplation of the Creator of them all.&nbsp; I
mention this the more gladly, because at that time, I am ashamed 
to say, I very seldom thought of my Creator, although I was 
constantly surrounded by the most beautiful and wonderful of His 
works.&nbsp; I observed from the expression of my 
companion&rsquo;s countenance that he too derived much joy from 
the splendid scenery, which was all the more agreeable to us 
after our long voyage on the salt sea.&nbsp; There, the breeze 
was fresh and cold, but here it was delightfully mild; and, when 
a puff blew off the land, it came laden with the most exquisite 
perfume that can be imagined.&nbsp; While we thus gazed, we were 
startled by a loud &ldquo;Huzza!&rdquo; from Peterkin, and, on 
looking towards the edge of the sea, we saw him capering and 
jumping about like a monkey, and ever and anon tugging with all 
his might at something that lay upon the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an odd fellow he is, to be sure,&rdquo; said Jack,
taking me by the arm and hurrying forward; &ldquo;come, let us 
hasten to see what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is, boys, hurrah! come along.&nbsp; Just what 
we want,&rdquo; cried Peterkin, as we drew near, still tugging 
with all his power.&nbsp; &ldquo;First rate; just the very 
ticket!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I need scarcely say to my readers that my companion Peterkin 
was in the habit of using very remarkable and peculiar 
phrases.&nbsp; And I am free to confess that I did not well 
understand the meaning of some of them,&mdash;such, for instance,
as &ldquo;the very ticket;&rdquo; but I think it my duty to 
recount everything relating to my adventures with a strict regard
to truthfulness in as far as my memory serves me; so I write, as 
nearly as possible, the exact words that my companions 
spoke.&nbsp; I often asked Peterkin to explain what he meant by 
&ldquo;ticket,&rdquo; but he always answered me by going into 
fits of laughter.&nbsp; However, by observing the occasions on 
which he used it, I came to understand that it meant to show that
something was remarkably good, or fortunate.</p>
<p>On coming up we found that Peterkin was vainly endeavouring to
pull the axe out of the oar, into which, it will be remembered, 
Jack struck it while endeavouring to cut away the cordage among 
which it had become entangled at the bow of the ship.&nbsp; 
Fortunately for us the axe had remained fast in the oar, and even
now, all Peterkin&rsquo;s strength could not draw it out of the 
cut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that is capital indeed,&rdquo; cried Jack, at the 
same time giving the axe a wrench that plucked it out of the 
tough wood.&nbsp; &ldquo;How fortunate this is!&nbsp; It will be 
of more value to us than a hundred knives, and the edge is quite 
new and sharp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll answer for the toughness of the handle at 
any rate,&rdquo; cried Peterkin; &ldquo;my arms are nearly pulled
out of the sockets.&nbsp; But see here, our luck is great.&nbsp; 
There is iron on the blade.&rdquo;&nbsp; He pointed to a piece of
hoop iron, as he spoke, which had been nailed round the blade of 
the oar to prevent it from splitting.</p>
<p>This also was a fortunate discovery.&nbsp; Jack went down on 
his knees, and with the edge of the axe began carefully to force 
out the nails.&nbsp; But as they were firmly fixed in, and the 
operation blunted our axe, we carried the oar up with us to the 
place where we had left the rest of our things, intending to burn
the wood away from the iron at a more convenient time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, lads,&rdquo; said Jack, after we had laid it on 
the stone which contained our little all, &ldquo;I propose that 
we should go to the tail of the island, where the ship struck, 
which is only a quarter of a mile off, and see if anything else 
has been thrown ashore.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t expect anything, but 
it is well to see.&nbsp; When we get back here it will be time to
have our supper and prepare our beds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed!&rdquo; cried Peterkin and I together, as, 
indeed, we would have agreed to any proposal that Jack made; for,
besides his being older and much stronger and taller than either 
of us, he was a very clever fellow, and I think would have 
induced people much older than himself to choose him for their 
leader, especially if they required to be led on a bold 
enterprise.</p>
<p>Now, as we hastened along the white beach, which shone so 
brightly in the rays of the setting sun that our eyes were quite 
dazzled by its glare, it suddenly came into Peterkin&rsquo;s head
that we had nothing to eat except the wild berries which grew in 
profusion at our feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do, Jack?&rdquo; said he, with a rueful 
look; &ldquo;perhaps they may be poisonous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear,&rdquo; replied Jack, confidently; &ldquo;I 
have observed that a few of them are not unlike some of the 
berries that grow wild on our own native hills.&nbsp; Besides, I 
saw one or two strange birds eating them just a few minutes ago, 
and what won&rsquo;t kill the birds won&rsquo;t kill us.&nbsp; 
But look up there, Peterkin,&rdquo; continued Jack, pointing to 
the branched head of a cocoa-nut palm.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are 
nuts for us in all stages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there are!&rdquo; cried Peterkin, who being of a 
very unobservant nature had been too much taken up with other 
things to notice anything so high above his head as the fruit of 
a palm tree.&nbsp; But, whatever faults my young comrade had, he 
could not be blamed for want of activity or animal spirits.&nbsp;
Indeed, the nuts had scarcely been pointed out to him when he 
bounded up the tall stem of the tree like a squirrel, and, in a 
few minutes, returned with three nuts, each as large as a 
man&rsquo;s fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better keep them till we return,&rdquo; raid 
Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us finish our work before 
eating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So be it, captain, go ahead,&rdquo; cried Peterkin, 
thrusting the nuts into his trousers pocket.&nbsp; &ldquo;In fact
I don&rsquo;t want to eat just now, but I would give a good deal 
for a drink.&nbsp; Oh that I could find a spring! but I 
don&rsquo;t see the smallest sign of one hereabouts.&nbsp; I say,
Jack, how does it happen that you seem to be up to 
everything?&nbsp; You have told us the names of half-a-dozen 
trees already, and yet you say that you were never in the South 
Seas before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not up to <i>everything</i>, Peterkin, as 
you&rsquo;ll find out ere long,&rdquo; replied Jack, with a 
smile; &ldquo;but I have been a great reader of books of travel 
and adventure all my life, and that has put me up to a good many 
things that you are, perhaps, not acquainted with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack, that&rsquo;s all humbug.&nbsp; If you begin 
to lay everything to the credit of books, I&rsquo;ll quite lose 
my opinion of you,&rdquo; cried Peterkin, with a look of 
contempt.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a lot o&rsquo; fellows 
that were <i>always</i> poring over books, and when they came to 
try to <i>do</i> anything, they were no better than 
baboons!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; retorted Jack; &ldquo;and I
have seen a lot of fellows who never looked into books at all, 
who knew nothing about anything except the things they had 
actually seen, and very little they knew even about these.&nbsp; 
Indeed, some were so ignorant that they did not know that 
cocoa-nuts grew on cocoa-nut trees!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not refrain from laughing at this rebuke, for there 
was much truth in it, as to Peterkin&rsquo;s ignorance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! maybe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; answered 
Peterkin; &ldquo;but I would not give <i>tuppence</i> for a man 
of books, if he had nothing else in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither would I,&rdquo; said Jack; &ldquo;but 
that&rsquo;s no reason why you should run books down, or think 
less of me for having read them.&nbsp; Suppose, now, Peterkin, 
that you wanted to build a ship, and I were to give you a long 
and particular account of the way to do it, would not that be 
very useful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it,&rdquo; said Peterkin, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suppose I were to write the account in a letter 
instead of telling you in words, would that be less 
useful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;no, perhaps not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose I were to print it, and send it to you in
the form of a book, would it not be as good and useful as 
ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother! Jack, you&rsquo;re a philosopher, and 
that&rsquo;s worse than anything!&rdquo; cried Peterkin, with a 
look of pretended horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Peterkin, we shall see,&rdquo; returned 
Jack, halting under the shade of a cocoa-nut tree.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;You said you were thirsty just a minute ago; now, jump up 
that tree and bring down a nut,&mdash;not a ripe one, bring a 
green, unripe one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peterkin looked surprised, but, seeing that Jack was in 
earnest, he obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, cut a hole in it with your penknife, and clap it 
to your mouth, old fellow,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>Peterkin did as he was directed, and we both burst into 
uncontrollable laughter at the changes that instantly passed over
his expressive countenance.&nbsp; No sooner had he put the nut to
his mouth, and thrown back his head in order to catch what came 
out of it, than his eyes opened to twice their ordinary size with
astonishment, while his throat moved vigorously in the act of 
swallowing.&nbsp; Then a smile and look of intense delight 
overspread his face, except, indeed, the mouth, which, being 
firmly fixed to the hole in the nut, could not take part in the 
expression; but he endeavoured to make up for this by winking at 
us excessively with his right eye.&nbsp; At length he stopped, 
and, drawing a long breath, exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nectar! perfect nectar!&nbsp; I say, Jack, you&rsquo;re
a Briton&mdash;the best fellow I ever met in my life.&nbsp; Only 
taste that!&rdquo; said he, turning to me and holding the nut to 
my mouth.&nbsp; I immediately drank, and certainly I was much 
surprised at the delightful liquid that flowed copiously down my 
throat.&nbsp; It was extremely cool, and had a sweet taste, 
mingled with acid; in fact, it was the likest thing to lemonade I
ever tasted, and was most grateful and refreshing.&nbsp; I handed
the nut to Jack, who, after tasting it, said, &ldquo;Now, 
Peterkin, you unbeliever, I never saw or tasted a cocoa nut in my
life before, except those sold in shops at home; but I once read 
that the green nuts contain that stuff, and you see it is 
true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pray,&rdquo; asked Peterkin, &ldquo;what sort of 
&lsquo;stuff&rsquo; does the ripe nut contain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hollow kernel,&rdquo; answered Jack, &ldquo;with a 
liquid like milk in it; but it does not satisfy thirst so well as
hunger.&nbsp; It is very wholesome food I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meat and drink on the same tree!&rdquo; cried Peterkin;
&ldquo;washing in the sea, lodging on the ground,&mdash;and all 
for nothing!&nbsp; My dear boys, we&rsquo;re set up for life; it 
must be the ancient Paradise,&mdash;hurrah!&rdquo; and Peterkin 
tossed his straw hat in the air, and ran along the beach 
hallooing like a madman with delight.</p>
<p>We afterwards found, however, that these lovely islands were 
very unlike Paradise in many things.&nbsp; But more of this in 
its proper place.</p>
<p>We had now come to the point of rocks on which the ship had 
struck, but did not find a single article, although we searched 
carefully among the coral rocks, which at this place jutted out 
so far as nearly to join the reef that encircled the 
island.&nbsp; Just as we were about to return, however, we saw 
something black floating in a little cove that had escaped our 
observation.&nbsp; Running forward, we drew it from the water, 
and found it to be a long thick leather boot, such as fishermen 
at home wear; and a few paces farther on we picked up its 
fellow.&nbsp; We at once recognised these as having belonged to 
our captain, for he had worn them during the whole of the storm, 
in order to guard his legs from the waves and spray that 
constantly washed over our decks.&nbsp; My first thought on 
seeing them was that our dear captain had been drowned; but Jack 
soon put my mind more at rest on that point, by saying that if 
the captain had been drowned with the boots on, he would 
certainly have been washed ashore along with them, and that he 
had no doubt whatever he had kicked them off while in the sea, 
that he might swim more easily.</p>
<p>Peterkin immediately put them on, but they were so large that,
as Jack said, they would have done for boots, trousers, and vest 
too.&nbsp; I also tried them, but, although I was long enough in 
the legs for them, they were much too large in the feet for me; 
so we handed them to Jack, who was anxious to make me keep them, 
but as they fitted his large limbs and feet as if they had been 
made for him, I would not hear of it, so he consented at last to 
use them.&nbsp; I may remark, however, that Jack did not use them
often, as they were extremely heavy.</p>
<p>It was beginning to grow dark when we returned to our 
encampment; so we put off our visit to the top of a hill till 
next day, and employed the light that yet remained to us in 
cutting down a quantity of boughs and the broad leaves of a tree,
of which none of us knew the name.&nbsp; With these we erected a 
sort of rustic bower, in which we meant to pass the night.&nbsp; 
There was no absolute necessity for this, because the air of our 
island was so genial and balmy that we could have slept quite 
well without any shelter; but we were so little used to sleeping 
in the open air, that we did not quite relish the idea of lying 
down without any covering over us: besides, our bower would 
shelter us from the night dews or rain, if any should happen to 
fall.&nbsp; Having strewed the floor with leaves and dry grass, 
we bethought ourselves of supper.</p>
<p>But it now occurred to us, for the first time, that we had no 
means of making a fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, there&rsquo;s a fix!&mdash;what shall we 
do?&rdquo; said Peterkin, while we both turned our eyes to Jack, 
to whom we always looked in our difficulties.&nbsp; Jack seemed 
not a little perplexed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are flints enough, no doubt, on the beach,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;but they are of no use at all without a 
steel.&nbsp; However, we must try.&rdquo;&nbsp; So saying, he 
went to the beach, and soon returned with two flints.&nbsp; On 
one of these he placed the tinder, and endeavoured to ignite it; 
but it was with great difficulty that a very small spark was 
struck out of the flints, and the tinder, being a bad, hard 
piece, would not catch.&nbsp; He then tried the bit of hoop iron,
which would not strike fire at all; and after that the back of 
the axe, with no better success.&nbsp; During all these trials 
Peterkin sat with his hands in his pockets, gazing with a most 
melancholy visage at our comrade, his face growing longer and 
more miserable at each successive failure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;I would not care a 
button for the cooking of our victuals,&mdash;perhaps they 
don&rsquo;t need it,&mdash;but it&rsquo;s so dismal to eat 
one&rsquo;s supper in the dark, and we have had such a capital 
day, that it&rsquo;s a pity to finish off in this glum 
style.&nbsp; Oh, I have it!&rdquo; he cried, starting up; 
&ldquo;the spy-glass,&mdash;the big glass at the end is a 
burning-glass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget that we have no sun,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>Peterkin was silent.&nbsp; In his sudden recollection of the 
telescope he had quite overlooked the absence of the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, boys, I&rsquo;ve got it now!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack,
rising and cutting a branch from a neighbouring bush, which be 
stripped of its leaves.&nbsp; &ldquo;I recollect seeing this done
once at home.&nbsp; Hand me the bit of whip-cord.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
With the cord and branch Jack soon formed a bow.&nbsp; Then he 
cut a piece, about three inches long, off the end of a dead 
branch, which he pointed at the two ends.&nbsp; Round this he 
passed the cord of the bow, and placed one end against his chest,
which was protected from its point by a chip of wood; the other 
point he placed against the bit of tinder, and then began to saw 
vigorously with the bow, just as a blacksmith does with his drill
while boring a hole in a piece of iron.&nbsp; In a few seconds 
the tinder began to smoke; in less than a minute it caught fire; 
and in less than a quarter of an hour we were drinking our 
lemonade and eating cocoa nuts round a fire that would have 
roasted an entire sheep, while the smoke, flames, and sparks, 
flew up among the broad leaves of the overhanging palm trees, and
cast a warm glow upon our leafy bower.</p>
<p>That night the starry sky looked down through the gently 
rustling trees upon our slumbers, and the distant roaring of the 
surf upon the coral reef was our lullaby.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p>Morning, and cogitations connected therewith&mdash;We 
luxuriate in the sea, try our diving powers, and make enchanting 
excursions among the coral groves at the bottom of the 
ocean&mdash;The wonders of the deep enlarged upon.</p>
<p>What a joyful thing it is to awaken, on a fresh glorious 
morning, and find the rising sun staring into your face with 
dazzling brilliancy!&mdash;to see the birds twittering in the 
bushes, and to hear the murmuring of a rill, or the soft hissing 
ripples as they fall upon the sea-shore!&nbsp; At any time and in
any place such sights and sounds are most charming, but more 
especially are they so when one awakens to them, for the fist 
time, in a novel and romantic situation, with the soft sweet air 
of a tropical climate mingling with the fresh smell of the sea, 
and stirring the strange leaves that flutter overhead and around 
one, or ruffling the plumage of the stranger birds that fly 
inquiringly around, as if to demand what business we have to 
intrude uninvited on their domains.&nbsp; When I awoke on the 
morning after the shipwreck, I found myself in this most 
delightful condition; and, as I lay on my back upon my bed of 
leaves, gazing up through the branches of the cocoa-nut trees 
into the clear blue sky, and watched the few fleecy clouds that 
passed slowly across it, my heart expanded more and more with an 
exulting gladness, the like of which I had never felt 
before.&nbsp; While I meditated, my thoughts again turned to the 
great and kind Creator of this beautiful world, as they had done 
on the previous day, when I first beheld the sea and the coral 
reef, with the mighty waves dashing over it into the calm waters 
of the lagoon.</p>
<p>While thus meditating, I naturally bethought me of my Bible, 
for I had faithfully kept the promise, which I gave at parting to
my beloved mother, that I would read it every morning; and it was
with a feeling of dismay that I remembered I had left it in the 
ship.&nbsp; I was much troubled about this.&nbsp; However, I 
consoled myself with reflecting that I could keep the second part
of my promise to her, namely, that I should never omit to say my 
prayers.&nbsp; So I rose quietly, lest I should disturb my 
companions, who were still asleep, and stepped aside into the 
bushes for this purpose.</p>
<p>On my return I found them still slumbering, so I again lay 
down to think over our situation.&nbsp; Just at that moment I was
attracted by the sight of a very small parrot, which Jack 
afterwards told me was called a paroquet.&nbsp; It was seated on 
a twig that overhung Peterkin&rsquo;s head, and I was speedily 
lost in admiration of its bright green plumage, which was mingled
with other gay colours.&nbsp; While I looked I observed that the 
bird turned its head slowly from side to side and looked 
downwards, fist with the one eye, and then with the other.&nbsp; 
On glancing downwards I observed that Peterkin&rsquo;s mouth was 
wide open, and that this remarkable bird was looking into 
it.&nbsp; Peterkin used to say that I had not an atom of fun in 
my composition, and that I never could understand a joke.&nbsp; 
In regard to the latter, perhaps he was right; yet I think that, 
when they were explained to me, I understood jokes as well as 
most people: but in regard to the former he must certainly have 
been wrong, for this bird seemed to me to be extremely funny; and
I could not help thinking that, if it should happen to faint, or 
slip its foot, and fall off the twig into Peterkin&rsquo;s mouth,
he would perhaps think it funny too!&nbsp; Suddenly the paroquet 
bent down its head and uttered a loud scream in his face.&nbsp; 
This awoke him, and, with a cry of surprise, he started up, while
the foolish bird flew precipitately away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you monster!&rdquo; cried Peterkin, shaking his fist
at the bird.&nbsp; Then he yawned and rubbed his eyes, and asked 
what o&rsquo;clock it was.</p>
<p>I smiled at this question, and answered that, as our watches 
were at the bottom of the sea, I could not tell, but it was a 
little past sunrise.</p>
<p>Peterkin now began to remember where we were.&nbsp; As he 
looked up into the bright sky, and snuffed the scented air, his 
eyes glistened with delight, and he uttered a faint 
&ldquo;hurrah!&rdquo; and yawned again.&nbsp; Then he gazed 
slowly round, till, observing the calm sea through an opening in 
the bushes, he started suddenly up as if he had received an 
electric shock, uttered a vehement shout, flung off his garments,
and, rushing over the white sands, plunged into the water.&nbsp; 
The cry awoke Jack, who rose on his elbow with a look of grave 
surprise; but this was followed by a quiet smile of intelligence 
on seeing Peterkin in the water.&nbsp; With an energy that he 
only gave way to in moments of excitement, Jack bounded to his 
feet, threw off his clothes, shook back his hair, and with a 
lion-like spring, dashed over the sands and plunged into the sea 
with such force as quite to envelop Peterkin in a shower of 
spray.&nbsp; Jack was a remarkably good swimmer and diver, so 
that after his plunge we saw no sign of him for nearly a minute; 
after which he suddenly emerged, with a cry of joy, a good many 
yards out from the shore.&nbsp; My spirits were so much raised by
seeing all this that I, too, hastily threw off my garments and 
endeavoured to imitate Jack&rsquo;s vigorous bound; but I was so 
awkward that my foot caught on a stump, and I fell to the ground;
then I slipped on a stone while running over the mud, and nearly 
fell again, much to the amusement of Peterkin, who laughed 
heartily, and called me a &ldquo;slow coach,&rdquo; while Jack 
cried out, &ldquo;Come along, Ralph, and I&rsquo;ll help 
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, when I got into the water I managed 
very well, for I was really a good swimmer, and diver too.&nbsp; 
I could not, indeed, equal Jack, who was superior to any 
Englishman I ever saw, but I infinitely surpassed Peterkin, who 
could only swim a little, and could not dive at all.</p>
<p>While Peterkin enjoyed himself in the shallow water and in 
running along the beach, Jack and I swam out into the deep water,
and occasionally dived for stones.&nbsp; I shall never forget my 
surprise and delight on first beholding the bottom of the 
sea.&nbsp; As I have before stated, the water within the reef was
as calm as a pond; and, as there was no wind, it was quite clear,
from the surface to the bottom, so that we could see down easily 
even at a depth of twenty or thirty yards.&nbsp; When Jack and I 
dived in shallower water, we expected to have found sand and 
stones, instead of which we found ourselves in what appeared 
really to be an enchanted garden.&nbsp; The whole of the bottom 
of the lagoon, as we called the calm water within the reef, was 
covered with coral of every shape, size, and hue.&nbsp; Some 
portions were formed like large mushrooms; others appeared like 
the brain of a man, having stalks or necks attached to them; but 
the most common kind was a species of branching coral, and some 
portions were of a lovely pale pink colour, others pure 
white.&nbsp; Among this there grew large quantities of sea-weed 
of the richest hues imaginable, and of the most graceful forms; 
while innumerable fishes&mdash;blue, red, yellow, green, and 
striped&mdash;sported in and out amongst the flower-beds of this 
submarine garden, and did not appear to be at all afraid of our 
approaching them.</p>
<p>On darting to the surface for breath, after our first dive, 
Jack and I rose close to each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever in your life, Ralph, see anything so 
lovely?&rdquo; said Jack, as he flung the spray from his 
hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;It appears to me 
like fairy realms.&nbsp; I can scarcely believe that we are not 
dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dreaming!&rdquo; cried Jack, &ldquo;do you know, Ralph,
I&rsquo;m half tempted to think that we really are 
dreaming.&nbsp; But if so, I am resolved to make the most of it, 
and dream another dive; so here goes,&mdash;down again, my 
boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We took the second dive together, and kept beside each other 
while under water; and I was greatly surprised to find that we 
could keep down much longer than I ever recollect having done in 
our own seas at home.&nbsp; I believe that this was owing to the 
heat of the water, which was so warm that we afterwards found we 
could remain in it for two and three hours at a time without 
feeling any unpleasant effects such as we used to experience in 
the sea at home.&nbsp; When Jack reached the bottom, he grasped 
the coral stems, and crept along on his hands and knees, peeping 
under the sea-weed and among the rocks.&nbsp; I observed him also
pick up one or two large oysters, and retain them in his grasp, 
as if he meant to take them up with him, so I also gathered a 
few.&nbsp; Suddenly he made a grasp at a fish with blue and 
yellow stripes on its back, and actually touched its tail, but 
did not catch it.&nbsp; At this he turned towards me and 
attempted to smile; but no sooner had he done so than he sprang 
like an arrow to the surface, where, on following him, I found 
him gasping and coughing, and spitting water from his 
mouth.&nbsp; In a few minutes he recovered, and we both turned to
swim ashore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare, Ralph,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I 
actually tried to laugh under water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I saw,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;and I observed that 
you very nearly caught that fish by the tail.&nbsp; It would have
done capitally for breakfast if you had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breakfast enough here,&rdquo; said he, holding up the 
oysters, as we landed and ran up the beach.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Hallo!&nbsp; Peterkin, here you are, boy.&nbsp; Split open
these fellows while Ralph and I put on our clothes.&nbsp; 
They&rsquo;ll agree with the cocoa nuts excellently, I have no 
doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peterkin, who was already dressed, took the oysters, and 
opened them with the edge of our axe, exclaiming, &ldquo;Now, 
that <i>is</i> capital.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing I&rsquo;m so 
fond of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s lucky,&rdquo; remarked Jack.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be able to keep you in good order now, Master 
Peterkin.&nbsp; You know you can&rsquo;t dive any better than a 
cat.&nbsp; So, sir, whenever you behave ill, you shall have no 
oysters for breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad that our prospect of breakfast is 
so good,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m very 
hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, then, stop your mouth with that, Ralph,&rdquo; 
said Peterkin, holding a large oyster to my lips.&nbsp; I opened 
my mouth and swallowed it in silence, and really it was 
remarkably good.</p>
<p>We now set ourselves earnestly about our preparations for 
spending the day.&nbsp; We had no difficulty with the fire this 
morning, as our burning-glass was an admirable one; and while we 
roasted a few oysters and ate our cocoa nuts, we held a long, 
animated conversation about our plans for the future.&nbsp; What 
those plans were, and how we carried them into effect, the reader
shall see hereafter.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p>An excursion into the interior, in which we make many valuable
and interesting discoveries&mdash;We get a dreadful 
fright&mdash;The bread-fruit tree&mdash;Wonderful peculiarity of 
some of the fruit trees&mdash;Signs of former inhabitants.</p>
<p>Our first care, after breakfast, was to place the few articles
we possessed in the crevice of a rock at the farther end of a 
small cave which we discovered near our encampment.&nbsp; This 
cave, we hoped, might be useful to us afterwards as a 
store-house.&nbsp; Then we cut two large clubs off a species of 
very hard tree which grew near at hand.&nbsp; One of these was 
given to Peterkin, the other to me, and Jack armed himself with 
the axe.&nbsp; We took these precautions because we purposed to 
make an excursion to the top of the mountains of the interior, in
order to obtain a better view of our island.&nbsp; Of course we 
knew not what dangers might befall us by the way, so thought it 
best to be prepared.</p>
<p>Having completed our arrangements and carefully extinguished 
our fire, we sallied forth and walked a short distance along the 
sea-beach, till we came to the entrance of a valley, through 
which flowed the rivulet before mentioned.&nbsp; Here we turned 
our backs on the sea and struck into the interior.</p>
<p>The prospect that burst upon our view on entering the valley 
was truly splendid.&nbsp; On either side of us there was a gentle
rise in the land, which thus formed two ridges about a mile apart
on each side of the valley.&nbsp; These ridges,&mdash;which, as 
well as the low grounds between them, were covered with trees and
shrubs of the most luxuriant kind&mdash;continued to recede 
inland for about two miles, when they joined the foot of a small 
mountain.&nbsp; This hill rose rather abruptly from the head of 
the valley, and was likewise entirely covered even to the top 
with trees, except on one particular spot near the left shoulder,
where was a bare and rocky place of a broken and savage 
character.&nbsp; Beyond this hill we could not see, and we 
therefore directed our course up the banks of the rivulet towards
the foot of it, intending to climb to the top, should that be 
possible, as, indeed, we had no doubt it was.</p>
<p>Jack, being the wisest and boldest among us, took the lead, 
carrying the axe on his shoulder.&nbsp; Peterkin, with his 
enormous club, came second, as he said he should like to be in a 
position to defend me if any danger should threaten.&nbsp; I 
brought up the rear, but, having been more taken up with the 
wonderful and curious things I saw at starting than with thoughts
of possible danger, I had very foolishly left my club behind 
me.&nbsp; Although, as I have said the trees and bushes were very
luxuriant, they were not so thickly crowded together as to hinder
our progress among them.&nbsp; We were able to wind in and out, 
and to follow the banks of the stream quite easily, although, it 
is true, the height and thickness of the foliage prevented us 
from seeing far ahead.&nbsp; But sometimes a jutting-out rock on 
the hill sides afforded us a position whence we could enjoy the 
romantic view and mark our progress towards the foot of the 
hill.&nbsp; I wag particularly struck, during the walk, with the 
richness of the undergrowth in most places, and recognised many 
berries and plants that resembled those of my native land, 
especially a tall, elegantly-formed fern, which emitted an 
agreeable perfume.&nbsp; There were several kinds of flowers, 
too, but I did not see so many of these as I should have expected
in such a climate.&nbsp; We also saw a great variety of small 
birds of bright plumage, and many paroquets similar to the one 
that awoke Peterkin so rudely in the morning.</p>
<p>Thus we advanced to the foot of the hill without encountering 
anything to alarm us, except, indeed, once, when we were passing 
close under a part of the hill which was hidden from our view by 
the broad leaves of the banana trees, which grew in great 
luxuriance in that part.&nbsp; Jack was just preparing to force 
his way through this thicket, when we were startled and arrested 
by a strange pattering or rumbling sound, which appeared to us 
quite different from any of the sounds we had heard during the 
previous part of our walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; cried Peterkin, stopping short and 
grasping his club with both hands, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s 
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither of us replied; but Jack seized his axe in his right 
hand, while with the other he pushed aside the broad leaves and 
endeavoured to peer amongst them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see nothing,&rdquo; he said, after a short 
pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the rumbling sound came, louder than before, and we all 
sprang back and stood on the defensive.&nbsp; For myself, having 
forgotten my club, and not having taken the precaution to cut 
another, I buttoned my jacket, doubled my fists, and threw myself
into a boxing attitude.&nbsp; I must say, however, that I felt 
somewhat uneasy; and my companions afterwards confessed that 
their thoughts at this moment had been instantly filled with all 
they had ever heard or read of wild beasts and savages, 
torturings at the stake, roastings alive, and such like horrible 
things.&nbsp; Suddenly the pattering noise increased with tenfold
violence.&nbsp; It was followed by a fearful crash among the 
bushes, which was rapidly repeated, as if some gigantic animal 
were bounding towards us.&nbsp; In another moment an enormous 
rock came crashing through the shrubbery, followed by a cloud of 
dust and small stones, flew close past the spot where we stood, 
carrying bushes and young trees along with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh! is that all?&rdquo; exclaimed Peterkin, wiping 
the perspiration off his forehead.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I thought it
was all the wild men and beasts in the South Sea Islands 
galloping on in one grand charge to sweep us off the face of the 
earth, instead of a mere stone tumbling down the mountain 
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; remarked Jack, &ldquo;if that same
stone had hit any of us, it would have rendered the charge you 
speak of quite unnecessary, Peterkin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was true, and I felt very thankful for our escape.&nbsp; 
On examining the spot more narrowly, we found that it lay close 
to the foot of a very rugged precipice, from which stones of 
various sizes were always tumbling at intervals.&nbsp; Indeed, 
the numerous fragments lying scattered all around might have 
suggested the cause of the sound, had we not been too suddenly 
alarmed to think of anything.</p>
<p>We now resumed our journey, resolving that, in our future 
excursions into the interior, we would be careful to avoid this 
dangerous precipice.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards we arrived at the foot of the hill and 
prepared to ascend it.&nbsp; Here Jack made a discovery which 
caused us all very great joy.&nbsp; This was a tree of a 
remarkably beautiful appearance, which Jack confidently declared 
to be the celebrated bread-fruit tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it celebrated?&rdquo; inquired Peterkin, with a look
of great simplicity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied Jack</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd, now,&rdquo; rejoined Peterkin; 
&ldquo;never heard of it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s not so celebrated as I thought it 
was,&rdquo; returned Jack, quietly squeezing Peterkin&rsquo;s hat
over his eyes; &ldquo;but listen, you ignorant boobie! and hear 
of it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peterkin re-adjusted his hat, and was soon listening with as 
much interest as myself, while Jack told us that this tree is one
of the most valuable in the islands of the south; that it bears 
two, sometimes three, crops of fruit in the year; that the fruit 
is very like wheaten bread in appearance, and that it constitutes
the principal food of many of the islanders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Peterkin, &ldquo;we seem to have 
everything ready prepared to our hands in this wonderful 
island,&mdash;lemonade ready bottled in nuts, and loaf-bread 
growing on the trees!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peterkin, as usual, was jesting; nevertheless, it is a curious
fact that he spoke almost the literal truth.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Moreover,&rdquo; continued Jack, &ldquo;the bread-fruit 
tree affords a capital gum, which serves the natives for pitching
their canoes; the bark of the young branches is made by them into
cloth; and of the wood, which is durable and of a good colour, 
they build their houses.&nbsp; So you see, lads, that we have no 
lack of material here to make us comfortable, if we are only 
clever enough to use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are you sure that that&rsquo;s it?&rdquo; asked 
Peterkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite sure,&rdquo; replied Jack; &ldquo;for I was 
particularly interested in the account I once read of it, and I 
remember the description well.&nbsp; I am sorry, however, that I 
have forgotten the descriptions of many other trees which I am 
sure we have seen to-day, if we could but recognise them.&nbsp; 
So you see, Peterkin, I&rsquo;m not up to everything 
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Jack,&rdquo; said Peterkin, with a grave, 
patronizing expression of countenance, patting his tall companion
on the shoulder,&mdash;&ldquo;never mind, Jack; you know a good 
deal for your age.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a clever boy, sir,&mdash;a 
promising young man; and if you only go on as you have begun, 
sir, you will&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The end of this speech was suddenly cut short by Jack tripping
up Peterkin&rsquo;s heels and tumbling him into a mass of thick 
shrubs, where, finding himself comfortable, he lay still basking 
in the sunshine, while Jack and I examined the bread-tree.</p>
<p>We were much struck with the deep, rich green colour of its 
broad leaves, which were twelve or eighteen inches long, deeply 
indented, and of a glossy smoothness, like the laurel.&nbsp; The 
fruit, with which it was loaded, was nearly round, and appeared 
to be about six inches in diameter, with a rough rind, marked 
with lozenge-shaped divisions.&nbsp; It was of various colours, 
from light pea-green to brown and rich yellow.&nbsp; Jack said 
that the yellow was the ripe fruit.&nbsp; We afterwards found 
that most of the fruit-trees on the island were evergreens, and 
that we might, when we wished, pluck the blossom and the ripe 
fruit from the same tree.&nbsp; Such a wonderful difference from 
the trees of our own country surprised us not a little.&nbsp; The
bark of the tree was rough and light-coloured; the trunk was 
about two feet in diameter, and it appeared to be twenty feet 
high, being quite destitute of branches up to that height, where 
it branched off into a beautiful and umbrageous head.&nbsp; We 
noticed that the fruit hung in clusters of twos and threes on the
branches; but as we were anxious to get to the top of the hill, 
we refrained from attempting to pluck any at that time.</p>
<p>Our hearts were now very much cheered by our good fortune, and
it was with light and active steps that we clambered up the steep
sides of the hill.&nbsp; On reaching the summit, a new, and if 
possible a grander, prospect met our gaze.&nbsp; We found that 
this was not the highest part of the island, but that another 
hill lay beyond, with a wide valley between it and the one on 
which we stood.&nbsp; This valley, like the first, was also full 
of rich trees, some dark and some light green, some heavy and 
thick in foliage, and others light, feathery, and graceful, while
the beautiful blossoms on many of them threw a sort of rainbow 
tint over all, and gave to the valley the appearance of a garden 
of flowers.&nbsp; Among these we recognised many of the 
bread-fruit trees, laden with yellow fruit, and also a great many
cocoa-nut palms.&nbsp; After gazing our fill we pushed down the 
hill side, crossed the valley, and soon began to ascend the 
second mountain.&nbsp; It was clothed with trees nearly to the 
top, but the summit was bare, and in some places broken.</p>
<p>While on our way up we came to an object which filled us with 
much interest.&nbsp; This was the stump of a tree that had 
evidently been cut down with an axe!&nbsp; So, then, we were not 
the first who had viewed this beautiful isle.&nbsp; The hand of 
man had been at work there before us.&nbsp; It now began to recur
to us again that perhaps the island was inhabited, although we 
had not seen any traces of man until now; but a second glance at 
the stump convinced us that we had not more reason to think so 
now than formerly; for the surface of the wood was quite decayed,
and partly covered with fungus and green matter, so that it must 
have been cut many years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Peterkin, &ldquo;some ship or 
other has touched here long ago for wood, and only taken one 
tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We did not think this likely, however, because, in such 
circumstances, the crew of a ship would cut wood of small size, 
and near the shore, whereas this was a large tree and stood near 
the top of the mountain.&nbsp; In fact it was the highest large 
tree on the mountain, all above it being wood of very recent 
growth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; said Jack, 
scratching the surface of the stump with his axe.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
can only suppose that the savages have been here and cut it for 
some purpose known only to themselves.&nbsp; But, hallo! what 
have we here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, Jack began carefully to scrape away the moss and 
fungus from the stump, and soon laid bare three distinct traces 
of marks, as if some inscription or initials had been cut 
thereon.&nbsp; But although the traces were distinct, beyond all 
doubt, the exact form of the letters could not be made out.&nbsp;
Jack thought they looked like J. S. but we could not be 
certain.&nbsp; They had apparently been carelessly cut, and long 
exposure to the weather had so broken them up that we could not 
make out what they were.&nbsp; We were exceedingly perplexed at 
this discovery, and stayed a long time at the place conjecturing 
what these marks could have been, but without avail; so, as the 
day was advancing, we left it and quickly reached the top of the 
mountain.</p>
<p>We found this to be the highest point of the island, and from 
it we saw our kingdom lying, as it were, like a map around 
us.&nbsp; As I have always thought it impossible to get a thing 
properly into one&rsquo;s understanding without comprehending it,
I shall beg the reader&rsquo;s patience for a little while I 
describe our island, thus, shortly:&mdash;</p>
<p>It consisted of two mountains; the one we guessed at 500 feet;
the other, on which we stood, at 1000.&nbsp; Between these lay a 
rich, beautiful valley, as already said.&nbsp; This valley 
crossed the island from one end to the other, being high in the 
middle and sloping on each side towards the sea.&nbsp; The large 
mountain sloped, on the side farthest from where we had been 
wrecked, gradually towards the sea; but although, when viewed at 
a glance, it had thus a regular sloping appearance, a more 
careful observation showed that it was broken up into a multitude
of very small vales, or rather dells and glens, intermingled with
little rugged spots and small but abrupt precipices here and 
there, with rivulets tumbling over their edges and wandering down
the slopes in little white streams, sometimes glistening among 
the broad leaves of the bread-fruit and cocoa-nut trees, or hid 
altogether beneath the rich underwood.&nbsp; At the base of this 
mountain lay a narrow bright green plain or meadow, which 
terminated abruptly at the shore.&nbsp; On the other side of the 
island, whence we had come, stood the smaller hill, at the foot 
of which diverged three valleys; one being that which we had 
ascended, with a smaller vale on each side of it, and separated 
from it by the two ridges before mentioned.&nbsp; In these 
smaller valleys there were no streams, but they were clothed with
the same luxuriant vegetation.</p>
<p>The diameter of the island seemed to be about ten miles, and, 
as it was almost circular in form, its circumference must have 
been thirty miles;&mdash;perhaps a little more, if allowance be 
made for the numerous bays and indentations of the shore.&nbsp; 
The entire island was belted by a beach of pure white sand, on 
which laved the gentle ripples of the lagoon.&nbsp; We now also 
observed that the coral reef completely encircled the island; but
it varied its distance from it here and there, in some places 
being a mile from the beach, in others, a few hundred yards, but 
the average distance was half a mile.&nbsp; The reef lay very 
low, and the spray of the surf broke quite over it in many 
places.&nbsp; This surf never ceased its roar, for, however calm 
the weather might be, there is always a gentle swaying motion in 
the great Pacific, which, although scarce noticeable out at sea, 
reaches the shore at last in a huge billow.&nbsp; The water 
within the lagoon, as before said, was perfectly still.&nbsp; 
There were three narrow openings in the reef; one opposite each 
end of the valley which I have described as crossing the island; 
the other opposite our own valley, which we afterwards named the 
Valley of the Wreck.&nbsp; At each of these openings the reef 
rose into two small green islets, covered with bushes and having 
one or two cocoa-nut palms on each.&nbsp; These islets were very 
singular, and appeared as if planted expressly for the purpose of
marking the channel into the lagoon.&nbsp; Our captain was making
for one of these openings the day we were wrecked, and would have
reached it too, I doubt not, had not the rudder been torn 
away.&nbsp; Within the lagoon were several pretty, low coral 
islands, just opposite our encampment; and, immediately beyond 
these, out at sea, lay about a dozen other islands, at various 
distances, from half a mile to ten miles; all of them, as far as 
we could discern, smaller than ours and apparently 
uninhabited.&nbsp; They seemed to be low coral islands, raised 
but little above the sea, yet covered with cocoa-nut trees.</p>
<p>All this we noted, and a great deal more, while we sat on the 
top of the mountain.&nbsp; After we had satisfied ourselves we 
prepared to return; but here again we discovered traces of the 
presence of man.&nbsp; These were a pole or staff and one or two 
pieces of wood which had been squared with an axe.&nbsp; All of 
these were, however, very much decayed, and they had evidently 
not been touched for many years.</p>
<p>Full of these discoveries we returned to our encampment.&nbsp;
On the way we fell in with the traces of some four-footed animal,
but whether old or of recent date none of us were able to 
guess.&nbsp; This also tended to raise our hopes of obtaining 
some animal food on the island, so we reached home in good 
spirits, quite prepared for supper, and highly satisfied with our
excursion.</p>
<p>After much discussion, in which Peterkin took the lead, we 
came to the conclusion that the island was uninhabited, and went 
to bed.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s ingenuity&mdash;We get into difficulties about 
fishing, and get out of them by a method which gives us a cold 
bath&mdash;Horrible encounter with a shark.</p>
<p>For several days after the excursion related in the last 
chapter we did not wander far from our encampment, but gave 
ourselves up to forming plans for the future and making our 
present abode comfortable.</p>
<p>There were various causes that induced this state of 
comparative inaction.&nbsp; In the first place, although 
everything around us was so delightful, and we could without 
difficulty obtain all that we required for our bodily comfort, we
did not quite like the idea of settling down here for the rest of
our lives, far away from our friends and our native land.&nbsp; 
To set energetically about preparations for a permanent residence
seemed so like making up our minds to saying adieu to home and 
friends for ever, that we tacitly shrank from it and put off our 
preparations, for one reason and another, as long as we 
could.&nbsp; Then there was a little uncertainty still as to 
there being natives on the island, and we entertained a kind of 
faint hope that a ship might come and take us off.&nbsp; But as 
day after day passed, and neither savages nor ships appeared, we 
gave up all hope of an early deliverance and set diligently to 
work at our homestead.</p>
<p>During this time, however, we had not been altogether 
idle.&nbsp; We made several experiments in cooking the cocoa-nut,
most of which did not improve it.&nbsp; Then we removed our 
goods, and took up our abode in the cave, but found the change so
bad that we returned gladly to the bower.&nbsp; Besides this we 
bathed very frequently, and talked a great deal; at least Jack 
and Peterkin did,&mdash;I listened.&nbsp; Among other useful 
things, Jack, who was ever the most active and diligent, 
converted about three inches of the hoop-iron into an excellent 
knife.&nbsp; First he beat it quite flat with the axe.&nbsp; Then
he made a rude handle, and tied the hoop-iron to it with our 
piece of whip-cord, and ground it to an edge on a piece of 
sand-stone.&nbsp; When it was finished he used it to shape a 
better handle, to which he fixed it with a strip of his cotton 
handkerchief;&mdash;in which operation he had, as Peterkin 
pointed out, torn off one of Lord Nelson&rsquo;s noses.&nbsp; 
However, the whip-cord, thus set free, was used by Peterkin as a 
fishing line.&nbsp; He merely tied a piece of oyster to the end 
of it.&nbsp; This the fish were allowed to swallow, and then they
were pulled quickly ashore.&nbsp; But as the line was very short 
and we had no boat, the fish we caught were exceedingly 
small.</p>
<p>One day Peterkin came up from the beach, where he had been 
angling, and said in a very cross tone, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell 
you what, Jack, I&rsquo;m not going to be humbugged with catching
such contemptible things any longer.&nbsp; I want you to swim out
with me on your back, and let me fish in deep water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, Peterkin,&rdquo; replied Jack, &ldquo;I had no
idea you were taking the thing so much to heart, else I would 
have got you out of that difficulty long ago.&nbsp; Let me 
see,&rdquo;&mdash;and Jack looked down at a piece of timber on 
which he had been labouring, with a peculiar gaze of abstraction,
which he always assumed when trying to invent or discover 
anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What say you to building a boat?&rdquo; he inquired, 
looking up hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take far too long,&rdquo; was the reply; 
&ldquo;can&rsquo;t be bothered waiting.&nbsp; I want to begin at 
once!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Jack considered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; he 
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fell a large tree and launch the 
trunk of it in the water, so that when you want to fish 
you&rsquo;ve nothing to do but to swim out to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would not a small raft do better?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much better; but we have no ropes to bind it together 
with.&nbsp; Perhaps we may find something hereafter that will do 
as well, but, in the meantime, let us try the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was agreed on, so we started off to a spot not far 
distant, where we knew of a tree that would suit us, which grew 
near the water&rsquo;s edge.&nbsp; As soon as we reached it Jack 
threw off his coat, and, wielding the axe with his sturdy arms, 
hacked and hewed at it for a quarter of an hour without 
stopping.&nbsp; Then he paused, and, while he sat down to rest, I
continued the work.&nbsp; Then Peterkin made a vigorous attack on
it, so that when Jack renewed his powerful blows, a few minutes 
cutting brought it down with a terrible crash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! now for it,&rdquo; cried Jack; &ldquo;let us 
off with its head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying he began to cut through the stem again, at about six
yards from the thick end.&nbsp; This done, he cut three strong, 
short poles or levers from the stout branches, with which to roll
the log down the beach into the sea; for, as it was nearly two 
feet thick at the large end, we could not move it without such 
helps.&nbsp; With the levers, however, we rolled it slowly into 
the sea.</p>
<p>Having been thus successful in launching our vessel, we next 
shaped the levers into rude oars or paddles, and then attempted 
to embark.&nbsp; This was easy enough to do; but, after seating 
ourselves astride the log, it was with the utmost difficulty we 
kept it from rolling round and plunging us into the water.&nbsp; 
Not that we minded that much; but we preferred, if possible, to 
fish in dry clothes.&nbsp; To be sure, our trousers were 
necessarily wet, as our legs were dangling in the water on each 
side of the log; but, as they could be easily dried, we did not 
care.&nbsp; After half an hour&rsquo;s practice, we became expert
enough to keep our balance pretty steadily.&nbsp; Then Peterkin 
laid down his paddle, and having baited his line with a whole 
oyster, dropt it into deep water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, Jack,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;be cautious; 
steer clear o&rsquo; that sea-weed.&nbsp; There; that&rsquo;s it;
gently, now, gently.&nbsp; I see a fellow at least a foot long 
down there, coming to&mdash;ha! that&rsquo;s it!&nbsp; Oh! 
bother, he&rsquo;s off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he bite?&rdquo; said Jack, urging the log onwards a
little with his paddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bite? ay!&nbsp; He took it into his mouth, but the 
moment I began to haul he opened his jaws and let it out 
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him swallow it next time,&rdquo; said Jack, 
laughing at the melancholy expression of Peterkin&rsquo;s 
visage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he&rsquo;s again,&rdquo; cried Peterkin, his eyes
flashing with excitement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look out!&nbsp; Now 
then!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Why, the brute 
<i>won&rsquo;t</i> swallow it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to haul him up by the mouth, then,&rdquo; cried 
Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do it gently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A heavy sigh and a look of blank despair showed that poor 
Peterkin had tried and failed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, lad,&rdquo; said Jack, in a voice of 
sympathy; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll move on, and offer it to some other 
fish.&rdquo;&nbsp; So saying, Jack plied his paddle; but scarcely
had he moved from the spot, when a fish with an enormous head and
a little body darted from under a rock and swallowed the bait at 
once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got him this time,&mdash;that&rsquo;s a fact!&rdquo; 
cried Peterkin, hauling in the line.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s 
swallowed the bait right down to his tail, I declare.&nbsp; Oh 
what a thumper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the fish came struggling to the surface, we leaned forward 
to see it, and overbalanced the log.&nbsp; Peterkin threw his 
arms round the fish&rsquo;s neck; and, in another instant, we 
were all floundering in the water!</p>
<p>A shout of laughter burst from us as we rose to the surface 
like three drowned rats, and seized hold of the log.&nbsp; We 
soon recovered our position, and sat more warily, while Peterkin 
secured the fish, which had well-nigh escaped in the midst of our
struggles.&nbsp; It was little worth having, however; but, as 
Peterkin remarked, it was better than the smouts he had been 
catching for the last two or three days; so we laid it on the log
before us, and having re-baited the line, dropt it in again for 
another.</p>
<p>Now, while we were thus intent upon our sport, our attention 
was suddenly attracted by a ripple on the sea, just a few yards 
away from us.&nbsp; Peterkin shouted to us to paddle in that 
direction, as he thought it was a big fish, and we might have a 
chance of catching it.&nbsp; But Jack, instead of complying, 
said, in a deep, earnest tone of voice, which I never before 
heard him use,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haul up your line, Peterkin; seize your paddle; 
quick,&mdash;it&rsquo;s a shark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horror with which we heard this may well be imagined, for 
it must be remembered that our legs were hanging down in the 
water, and we could not venture to pull them up without upsetting
the log.&nbsp; Peterkin instantly hauled up the line; and, 
grasping his paddle, exerted himself to the utmost, while we also
did our best to make for shore.&nbsp; But we were a good way off,
and the log being, as I have before said, very heavy, moved but 
slowly through the water.&nbsp; We now saw the shark quite 
distinctly swimming round and round us, its sharp fin every now 
and then protruding above the water.&nbsp; From its active and 
unsteady motions, Jack knew it was making up its mind to attack 
us, so he urged us vehemently to paddle for our lives, while he 
himself set us the example.&nbsp; Suddenly he shouted &ldquo;Look
out!&mdash;there he comes!&rdquo; and in a second we saw the 
monstrous fish dive close under us, and turn half over on his 
side.&nbsp; But we all made a great commotion with our paddles, 
which no doubt frightened it away for that time, as we saw it 
immediately after circling round us as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw the fish to him,&rdquo; cried Jack, in a quick, 
suppressed voice; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll make the shore in time yet 
if we can keep him off for a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peterkin stopped one instant to obey the command, and then 
plied his paddle again with all his might.&nbsp; No sooner had 
the fish fallen on the water than we observed the shark to 
sink.&nbsp; In another second we saw its white breast rising; for
sharks always turn over on their sides when about to seize their 
prey, their mouths being not at the point of their heads like 
those of other fish, but, as it were, under their chins.&nbsp; In
another moment his snout rose above the water,&mdash;his wide 
jaws, armed with a terrific double row of teeth, appeared.&nbsp; 
The dead fish was engulfed, and the shark sank out of 
sight.&nbsp; But Jack was mistaken in supposing that it would be 
satisfied.&nbsp; In a very few minutes it returned to us, and its
quick motions led us to fear that it would attack us at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop paddling,&rdquo; cried Jack suddenly.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I see it coming up behind us.&nbsp; Now, obey my orders 
quickly.&nbsp; Our lives may depend on it Ralph.&nbsp; Peterkin, 
do your best to <i>balance the log</i>.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t look 
out for the shark.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t glance behind you.&nbsp; Do 
nothing but balance the log.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p77b.jpg">
<img alt="A dreadful adventure" src="images/p77s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Peterkin and I instantly did as we were ordered, being only 
too glad to do anything that afforded us a chance or a hope of 
escape, for we had implicit confidence in Jack&rsquo;s courage 
and wisdom.&nbsp; For a few seconds, that seemed long minutes to 
my mind, we sat thus silently; but I could not resist glancing 
backward, despite the orders to the contrary.&nbsp; On doing so, 
I saw Jack sitting rigid like a statue, with his paddle raised, 
his lips compressed, and his eye-brows bent over his eyes, which 
glared savagely from beneath them down into the water.&nbsp; I 
also saw the shark, to my horror, quite close under the log, in 
the act of darting towards Jack&rsquo;s foot.&nbsp; I could 
scarce suppress a cry on beholding this.&nbsp; In another moment 
the shark rose.&nbsp; Jack drew his leg suddenly from the water, 
and threw it over the log.&nbsp; The monster&rsquo;s snout rubbed
against the log as it passed, and revealed its hideous jaws, into
which Jack instantly plunged the paddle, and thrust it down its 
throat.&nbsp; So violent was the act that Jack rose to his feet 
in performing it; the log was thereby rolled completely over, and
we were once more plunged into the water.&nbsp; We all rose, 
spluttering and gasping, in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, strike out for shore,&rdquo; cried 
Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here, Peterkin, catch hold of my collar, and 
kick out with a will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peterkin did as he was desired, and Jack struck out with such 
force that he cut through the water like a boat; while I, being 
free from all encumbrance, succeeded in keeping up with 
him.&nbsp; As we had by this time drawn pretty near to the shore,
a few minutes more sufficed to carry us into shallow water; and, 
finally, we landed in safety, though very much exhausted, and not
a little frightened by our terrible adventure.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p>The beauties of the bottom of the sea tempt Peterkin to 
dive&mdash;How he did it&mdash;More difficulties 
overcome&mdash;The water garden&mdash;Curious creatures of the 
sea&mdash;The tank&mdash;Candles missed very much, and the 
candle-nut tree discovered&mdash;Wonderful account of 
Peterkin&rsquo;s first voyage&mdash;Cloth found growing on a 
tree&mdash;A plan projected, and arms prepared for offence and 
defence&mdash;A dreadful cry.</p>
<p>Our encounter with the shark was the first great danger that 
had befallen us since landing on this island, and we felt very 
seriously affected by it, especially when we considered that we 
had so often unwittingly incurred the same danger before while 
bathing.&nbsp; We were now forced to take to fishing again in the
shallow water, until we should succeed in constructing a 
raft.&nbsp; What troubled us most, however, was, that we were 
compelled to forego our morning swimming excursions.&nbsp; We 
did, indeed, continue to enjoy our bathe in the shallow water, 
but Jack and I found that one great source of our enjoyment was 
gone, when we could no longer dive down among the beautiful coral
groves at the bottom of the lagoon.&nbsp; We had come to be so 
fond of this exercise, and to take such an interest in watching 
the formations of coral and the gambols of the many beautiful 
fish amongst the forests of red and green sea-weeds, that we had 
become quite familiar with the appearance of the fish and the 
localities that they chiefly haunted.&nbsp; We had also become 
expert divers.&nbsp; But we made it a rule never to stay long 
under water at a time.&nbsp; Jack told me that to do so often was
bad for the lungs, and, instead of affording us enjoyment, would 
ere long do us a serious injury.&nbsp; So we never stayed at the 
bottom as long as we might have done, but came up frequently to 
the top for fresh air, and dived down again immediately.&nbsp; 
Sometimes, when Jack happened to be in a humorous frame, he would
seat himself at the bottom of the sea on one of the brain corals,
as if he were seated on a large paddock-stool, and then make 
faces at me, in order, if possible, to make me laugh under 
water.&nbsp; At first, when he took me unawares, he nearly 
succeeded, and I had to shoot to the surface in order to laugh; 
but afterwards I became aware of his intentions, and, being 
naturally of a grave disposition, I had no difficulty in 
restraining myself.&nbsp; I used often to wonder how poor 
Peterkin would have liked to be with us; and he sometimes 
expressed much regret at being unable to join us.&nbsp; I used to
do my best to gratify him, poor fellow, by relating all the 
wonders that we saw; but this, instead of satisfying, seemed only
to whet his curiosity the more, so one day we prevailed on him to
try to go down with us.&nbsp; But, although a brave boy in every 
other way, Peterkin was very nervous in the water, and it was 
with difficulty we got him to consent to be taken down, for he 
could never have managed to push himself down to the bottom 
without assistance.&nbsp; But no sooner had we pulled him down a 
yard or so into the deep clear water, than he began to struggle 
and kick violently, so we were forced to let him go, when he rose
out of the water like a cork, gave a loud gasp and a frightful 
roar, and struck out for the land with the utmost possible 
haste.</p>
<p>Now, all this pleasure we were to forego, and when we thought 
thereon, Jack and I felt very much depressed in our 
spirits.&nbsp; I could see, also, that Peterkin grieved and 
sympathized with us, for, when talking about this matter, he 
refrained from jesting and bantering us upon it.</p>
<p>As, however, a man&rsquo;s difficulties usually set him upon 
devising methods to overcome them, whereby he often discovers 
better things than those he may have lost, so this our difficulty
induced us to think of searching for a large pool among the 
rocks, where the water should be deep enough for diving yet so 
surrounded by rocks as to prevent sharks from getting at 
us.&nbsp; And such a pool we afterwards found, which proved to be
very much better than our most sanguine hopes anticipated.&nbsp; 
It was situated not more than ten minutes&rsquo; walk from our 
camp, and was in the form of a small deep bay or basin, the 
entrance to which, besides being narrow, was so shallow that no 
fish so large as a shark could get in, at least not unless he 
should be a remarkably thin one.</p>
<p>Inside of this basin, which we called our Water Garden, the 
coral formations were much more wonderful, and the sea-weed 
plants far more lovely and vividly coloured, than in the lagoon 
itself.&nbsp; And the water was so clear and still, that, 
although very deep, you could see the minutest object at the 
bottom.&nbsp; Besides this, there was a ledge of rock which 
overhung the basin at its deepest part, from which we could dive 
pleasantly and whereon Peterkin could sit and see not only all 
the wonders I had described to him, but also see Jack and me 
creeping amongst the marine shrubbery at the bottom, like, 
as&mdash;he expressed it,&mdash;&ldquo;two great white 
sea-monsters.&rdquo;&nbsp; During these excursions of ours to the
bottom of the sea, we began to get an insight into the manners 
and customs of its inhabitants, and to make discoveries of 
wonderful things, the like of which we never before 
conceived.&nbsp; Among other things, we were deeply interested 
with the operations of the little coral insect which, I was 
informed by Jack, is supposed to have entirely constructed many 
of the numerous islands in Pacific Ocean.&nbsp; And, certainly, 
when we considered the great reef which these insects had formed 
round the island on which we were cast, and observed their 
ceaseless activity in building their myriad cells, it did at 
first seem as if this might be true; but then, again, when I 
looked at the mountains of the island, and reflected that there 
were thousands of such, many of them much higher, in the South 
Seas, I doubted that there must be some mistake here.&nbsp; But 
more of this hereafter.</p>
<p>I also became much taken up with the manners and appearance of
the anemones, and star-fish, and crabs, and sea-urchins, and 
such-like creatures; and was not content with watching those I 
saw during my dives in the Water Garden, but I must needs scoop 
out a hole in the coral rock close to it, which I filled with 
salt water, and stocked with sundry specimens of anemones and 
shell-fish, in order to watch more closely how they were in the 
habit of passing their time.&nbsp; Our burning-glass also now 
became a great treasure to me, as it enabled me to magnify, and 
so to perceive more clearly the forms and actions of these 
curious creatures of the deep.</p>
<p>Having now got ourselves into a very comfortable condition, we
began to talk of a project which we had long had in 
contemplation,&mdash;namely, to travel entirely round the island;
in order, first, to ascertain whether it contained any other 
productions which might be useful to us; and, second, to see 
whether there might be any place more convenient and suitable for
our permanent residence than that on which we were now 
encamped.&nbsp; Not that we were in any degree dissatisfied with 
it; on the contrary, we entertained quite a home-feeling to our 
bower and its neighbourhood; but if a better place did exist, 
there was no reason why we should not make use of it.&nbsp; At 
any rate, it would be well to know of its existence.</p>
<p>We had much earnest talk over this matter.&nbsp; But Jack 
proposed that, before undertaking such an excursion, we should 
supply ourselves with good defensive arms, for, as we intended 
not only to go round all the shore, but to ascend most of the 
valleys, before returning home, we should be likely to meet in 
with, he would not say dangers, but, at least, with everything 
that existed on the island, whatever that might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t do for
us to live on cocoa-nuts and oysters always.&nbsp; No doubt they 
are very excellent in their way, but I think a little animal 
food, now and then, would be agreeable as well as good for us; 
and as there are many small birds among the trees, some of which 
are probably very good to eat, I think it would be a capital plan
to make bows and arrows, with which we could easily knock them 
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First rate!&rdquo; cried Peterkin.&nbsp; &ldquo;You 
will make the bows, Jack, and I&rsquo;ll try my hand at the 
arrows.&nbsp; The fact is, I&rsquo;m quite tired of throwing 
stones at the birds.&nbsp; I began the very day we landed, I 
think, and have persevered up to the present time, but I&rsquo;ve
never hit anything yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you hit me one day on
the shin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, true,&rdquo; replied Peterkin, &ldquo;and a 
precious shindy you kicked up in consequence.&nbsp; But you were 
at least four yards away from the impudent paroquet I aimed at; 
so you see what a horribly bad shot I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Jack, you cannot make three 
bows and arrows before to-morrow, and would it not be a pity to 
waste time, now that we have made up our minds to go on this 
expedition?&nbsp; Suppose that you make one bow and arrow for 
yourself, and we can take our clubs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, Ralph.&nbsp; The day is pretty far 
advanced, and I doubt if I can make even one bow before 
dark.&nbsp; To be sure I might work by fire-light, after the sun 
goes down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had, up to this time, been in the habit of going to bed 
with the sun, as we had no pressing call to work o&rsquo; nights;
and, indeed, our work during the day was usually hard 
enough,&mdash;what between fishing, and improving our bower, and 
diving in the Water Garden, and rambling in the woods; so that, 
when night came, we were usually very glad to retire to our 
beds.&nbsp; But now that we had a desire to work at night, we 
felt a wish for candles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t a good blazing fire give you light 
enough?&rdquo; inquired Peterkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Jack, &ldquo;quite enough; but then
it will give us a great deal more than enough of heat in this 
warm climate of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Peterkin; &ldquo;I forgot that.&nbsp;
It would roast us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as you&rsquo;re always doing that at any 
rate,&rdquo; remarked Jack, &ldquo;we could scarcely call it a 
change.&nbsp; But the fact is, I&rsquo;ve been thinking over this
subject before.&nbsp; There is a certain nut growing in these 
islands which is called the candle-nut, because the natives use 
it instead of candles, and I know all about it, and how to 
prepare it for burning&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you do it?&rdquo; interrupted 
Peterkin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why have you kept us in the dark so long, 
you vile philosopher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;I have not seen the 
tree yet, and I&rsquo;m not sure that I should know either the 
tree or the nuts if I did see them.&nbsp; You see, I forget the 
description.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s just the way with me,&rdquo; said 
Peterkin with a deep sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never could keep in my 
mind for half an hour the few descriptions I ever attempted to 
remember.&nbsp; The very first voyage I ever made was caused by 
my mistaking a description, or forgetting it, which is the same 
thing.&nbsp; And a horrible voyage it was.&nbsp; I had to fight 
with the captain the whole way out, and made the homeward voyage 
by swimming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Peterkin,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t 
get even <i>me</i> to believe that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not, but it&rsquo;s true, 
notwithstanding,&rdquo; returned Peterkin, pretending to be hurt 
at my doubting his word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hear how it happened,&rdquo; said Jack, while a 
good-natured smile overspread his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you must know,&rdquo; began Peterkin, &ldquo;that
the very day before I went to sea, I was greatly taken up with a 
game at hockey, which I was playing with my old school-fellows 
for the last time before leaving them.&nbsp; You see I was young 
then, Ralph.&rdquo;&nbsp; Peterkin gazed, in an abstracted and 
melancholy manner, out to sea!&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, in the midst of
the game, my uncle, who had taken all the bother and trouble of 
getting me bound &rsquo;prentice and rigged out, came and took me
aside, and told me that he was called suddenly away from home, 
and would not be able to see me aboard, as he had intended.&nbsp;
&lsquo;However,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;the captain knows you are 
coming, so that&rsquo;s not of much consequence; but as 
you&rsquo;ll have to find the ship yourself, you must remember 
her name and description.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye hear, 
boy?&rsquo;&nbsp; I certainly did hear, but I&rsquo;m afraid I 
did not understand, for my mind was so taken up with the game, 
which I saw my side was losing, that I began to grow impatient, 
and the moment my uncle finished his description of the ship, and
bade me good-bye, I bolted back to my game, with only a confused 
idea of three masts, and a green painted tafferel, and a gilt 
figure-head of Hercules with his club at the bow.&nbsp; Next day 
I was so much cast down with everybody saying good-bye, and a lot
o&rsquo; my female friends cryin&rsquo; horribly over me, that I 
did not start for the harbour, where the ship was lying among a 
thousand others, till it was almost too late.&nbsp; So I had to 
run the whole way.&nbsp; When I reached the pier, there were so 
many masts, and so much confusion, that I felt quite 
humblebumbled in my faculties.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said I to
myself, &lsquo;Peterkin, you&rsquo;re in a fix.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then
I fancied I saw a gilt figure-head and three masts, belonging to 
a ship just about to start; so I darted on board, but speedily 
jumped on shore again, when I found that two of the masts 
belonged to another vessel, and the figurehead to a third!&nbsp; 
At last I caught sight of what I made sure was it,&mdash;a fine 
large vessel just casting off her moorings.&nbsp; The tafferel 
was green.&nbsp; Three masts,&mdash;yes, that must be 
it,&mdash;and the gilt figure-head of Hercules.&nbsp; To be sure 
it had a three-pronged pitchfork in its hand instead of a club; 
but that might be my uncle&rsquo;s mistake; or perhaps Hercules 
sometimes varied his weapons.&nbsp; &lsquo;Cast off!&rsquo; 
roared a voice from the quarter-deck.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hold 
on!&rsquo; cried I, rushing frantically through the crowd.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Hold on! hold on!&rsquo; repeated some of the bystanders, 
while the men at the ropes delayed for a minute.&nbsp; This threw
the captain into a frightful rage; for some of his friends had 
come down to see him off, and having his orders contradicted so 
flatly was too much for him.&nbsp; However, the delay was 
sufficient.&nbsp; I took a race and a good leap; the ropes were 
cast off; the steam-tug gave a puff, and we started.&nbsp; 
Suddenly the captain was up to me: &lsquo;Where did you come 
from, you scamp, and what do you want here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Please, sir,&rsquo; said I, touching my cap, 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m you&rsquo;re new &rsquo;prentice come 
aboard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;New &rsquo;Prentice,&rsquo; said he, stamping, 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got no new &rsquo;prentice.&nbsp; My boys are 
all aboard already.&nbsp; This is a trick, you young 
blackguard.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve run away, you have;&rsquo; and the
captain stamped about the deck and swore dreadfully; for, you 
see, the thought of having to stop the ship and lower a boat and 
lose half an hour, all for the slake of sending a small boy 
ashore, seemed to make him very angry.&nbsp; Besides, it was 
blowin&rsquo; fresh outside the harbour, so that, to have let the
steamer alongside to put me into it was no easy job.&nbsp; Just 
as we were passing the pier-head, where several boats were rowing
into harbour, the captain came up to me,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You&rsquo;ve run away, you blackguard,&rsquo; he
said, giving me a box on the ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No I haven&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said I, angrily; for 
the box was by no means a light one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark&rsquo;ee, boy, can you swim?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then do it,&rsquo; and, seizing me by my 
trousers and the nape of my neck, he tossed me over the side into
the sea.&nbsp; The fellows in the boats at the end of the pier, 
backed their oars on seeing this; but observing that I could 
swim, they allowed me to make the best of my way to the 
pier-head.&nbsp; So, you see, Ralph, that I really did swim my 
first homeward voyage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack laughed and patted Peterkin on the shoulder.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;But tell us about the candle-nut tree,&rdquo; said I; 
&ldquo;you were talking about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;but I fear I can 
remember little about it.&nbsp; I believe the nut is about the 
size of a walnut; and I think that the leaves are white, but I am
not sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh! ha! hum!&rdquo; exclaimed Peterkin, &ldquo;I saw a 
tree answering to that description this very day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; cried Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it far from
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not half a mile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then lead me to it,&rdquo; said Jack, seizing his 
axe.</p>
<p>In a few minutes we were all three pushing through the 
underwood of the forest, headed by Peterkin.</p>
<p>We soon came to the tree in question, which, after Jack had 
closely examined it, we concluded must be the candle-nut 
tree.&nbsp; Its leaves were of a beautiful silvery white, and 
formed a fine contrast to the dark-green foliage of the 
surrounding trees.&nbsp; We immediately filled our pockets with 
the nuts, after which Jack said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Peterkin, climb that cocoa-nut tree and cut me one
of the long branches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was soon done, but it cost some trouble, for the stem was
very high, and as Peterkin usually pulled nuts from the younger 
trees, he was not much accustomed to climbing the high 
ones.&nbsp; The leaf or branch was a very large one, and we were 
surprised at its size and strength.&nbsp; Viewed from a little 
distance, the cocoa-nut tree seems to be a tall, straight stem, 
without a single branch except at the top, where there is a tuft 
of feathery-looking leaves, that seem to wave like soft plumes in
the wind.&nbsp; But when we saw one of these leaves or branches 
at our feet, we found it to be a strong stalk, about fifteen feet
long, with a number of narrow, pointed leaflets ranged 
alternately on each side.&nbsp; But what seemed to us the most 
wonderful thing about it was a curious substance resembling 
cloth, which was wrapped round the thick end of the stalk, where 
it had been cut from the tree.&nbsp; Peterkin told us that he had
the greatest difficulty in separating the branch from the stem, 
on account of this substance, as it was wrapped quite round the 
tree, and, he observed, round all the other branches, thus 
forming a strong support to the large leaves while exposed to 
high winds.&nbsp; When I call this substance cloth I do not 
exaggerate.&nbsp; Indeed, with regard to all the things I saw 
during my eventful career in the South Seas, I have been 
exceedingly careful not to exaggerate, or in any way to mislead 
or deceive my readers.&nbsp; This cloth, I say, was remarkably 
like to coarse brown cotton cloth.&nbsp; It had a seam or fibre 
down the centre of it, from which diverged other fibres, about 
the size of a bristle.&nbsp; There were two layers of these 
fibres, very long and tough, the one layer crossing the other 
obliquely, and the whole was cemented together with a still finer
fibrous and adhesive substance.&nbsp; When we regarded it 
attentively, we could with difficulty believe that it had not 
been woven by human hands.&nbsp; This remarkable piece of cloth 
we stripped carefully off, and found it to be above two feet 
long, by a foot broad, and we carried it home with us as a great 
prize.</p>
<p>Jack now took one of the leaflets, and, cutting out the 
central spine or stalk, hurried back with it to our camp.&nbsp; 
Having made a small fire, he baked the nuts slightly, and then 
pealed off the husks.&nbsp; After this he wished to bore a hole 
in them, which, not having anything better at hand at the time, 
he did with the point of our useless pencil-case.&nbsp; Then he 
strung them on the cocoa-nut spine, and on putting a light to the
topmost nut, we found to our joy that it burned with a clear, 
beautiful flame; upon seeing which, Peterkin sprang up and danced
round the fire for at least five minutes in the excess of his 
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now lads,&rdquo; said Jack, extinguishing our candle, 
the sun will set in an hour, so we have no time to lose.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I shall go and cut a young tree to make my bow out of, and
you had better each of you go and select good strong sticks for 
clubs, and we&rsquo;ll set to work at them after dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying he shouldered his axe and went off, followed by 
Peterkin, while I took up the piece of newly discovered cloth, 
and fell to examining its structure.&nbsp; So engrossed was I in 
this that I was still sitting in the same attitude and occupation
when my companions returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you so!&rdquo; cried Peterkin, with a loud 
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Ralph, you&rsquo;re incorrigible.&nbsp; 
See, there&rsquo;s a club for you.&nbsp; I was sure, when we left
you looking at that bit of stuff, that we would find you poring 
over it when we came back, so I just cut a club for you as well 
as for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Peterkin,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was
kind of you to do that, instead of scolding me for a lazy fellow,
as I confess I deserve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! as to that,&rdquo; returned Peterkin, 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll blow you up yet, if you wish it&mdash;only it 
would be of no use if I did, for you&rsquo;re a perfect 
mule!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As it was now getting dark we lighted our candle, and placing 
it in a holder made of two crossing branches, inside of our 
bower, we seated ourselves on our leafy beds and began to 
work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intend to appropriate the bow for my own use,&rdquo; 
said Jack, chipping the piece of wood he had brought with his 
axe.&nbsp; &ldquo;I used to be a pretty fair shot once.&nbsp; But
what&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; he added, looking at
Peterkin, who had drawn the end of a long pole into the tent, and
was endeavouring to fit a small piece of the hoop-iron to the end
of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to enlist into the Lancers,&rdquo; 
answered Peterkin.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see, Jack, I find the club 
rather an unwieldy instrument for my delicately-formed muscles, 
and I flatter myself I shall do more execution with a 
spear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if length constitutes power,&rdquo; said Jack, 
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll certainly be invincible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pole which Peterkin had cut was full twelve feet long, 
being a very strong but light and tough young tree, which merely 
required thinning at the butt to be a serviceable weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very good idea,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which&mdash;this?&rdquo; inquired Peterkin, pointing to
the spear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes;&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;you&rsquo;d find it a 
pretty tough and matter-of-fact idea, if you had it stuck through
your gizzard, old boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean the idea of making it is a good one,&rdquo; said
I, laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;And, now I think of it, I&rsquo;ll 
change my plan, too.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think much of a club, so
I&rsquo;ll make me a sling out of this piece of cloth.&nbsp; I 
used to be very fond of slinging, ever since I read of David 
slaying Goliath the Philistine, and I was once thought to be 
expert at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I set to work to manufacture a sling.&nbsp; For a long time
we all worked very busily without speaking.&nbsp; At length 
Peterkin looked up: &ldquo;I say, Jack, I&rsquo;m sorry to say I 
must apply to you for another strip of your handkerchief, to tie 
on this rascally head with.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s pretty well torn at 
any rate, so you won&rsquo;t miss it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack proceeded to comply with this request when Peterkin 
suddenly laid his hand on his arm and arrested him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist, man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;be tender; you should
never be needlessly cruel if you can help it.&nbsp; Do try to 
shave past Lord Nelson&rsquo;s mouth without tearing it, if 
possible!&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; There are plenty more handkerchiefs
on the cocoa-nut trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Peterkin! with what pleasant feelings I recall and record
his jests and humorous sayings now!</p>
<p>While we were thus engaged, we were startled by a distant but 
most strange and horrible cry.&nbsp; It seemed to come from the 
sea, but was so far away that we could not clearly distinguish 
its precise direction.&nbsp; Rushing out of our bower, we 
hastened down to the beach and stayed to listen.&nbsp; Again it 
came quite loud and distinct on the night air,&mdash;a prolonged,
hideous cry, something like the braying of an ass.&nbsp; The moon
had risen, and we could see the islands in and beyond the lagoon 
quite plainly, but there was no object visible to account for 
such a cry.&nbsp; A strong gust of wind was blowing from the 
point whence the sound came, but this died away while we were 
gazing out to sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can it be?&rdquo; said Peterkin, in a low whisper,
while we all involuntarily crept closer to each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;I have heard that
mysterious sound twice before, but never so loud as 
to-night.&nbsp; Indeed it was so faint that I thought I must have
merely fancied it, so, as I did not wish to alarm you, I said 
nothing about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We listened for a long time for the sound again, but as it did
not come, we returned to the bower and resumed our work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very strange,&rdquo; said Peterkin, quite 
gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you believe in ghosts, Ralph?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I do not.&nbsp; 
Nevertheless I must confess that strange, unaccountable sounds, 
such as we have just heard, make me feel a little 
uneasy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What say you to it, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I neither believe in ghosts nor feel uneasy,&rdquo; he 
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never saw a ghost myself, and I never met
with any one who had; and I have generally found that strange and
unaccountable things have almost always been accounted for, and 
found to be quite simple, on close examination.&nbsp; I certainly
can&rsquo;t imagine what <i>that</i> sound is; but I&rsquo;m 
quite sure I shall find out before long,&mdash;and if it&rsquo;s 
a ghost I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat it,&rdquo; cried Peterkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll eat it!&nbsp; Now, then, my bow and two
arrows are finished; so if you&rsquo;re ready we had better turn 
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Peterkin had thinned down his spear and tied an 
iron point very cleverly to the end of it; I had formed a sling, 
the lines of which were composed of thin strips of the cocoa-nut 
cloth, plaited; and Jack had made a stout bow, nearly five feet 
long, with two arrows, feathered with two or three large plumes 
which some bird had dropt.&nbsp; They had no barbs, but Jack said
that if arrows were well feathered, they did not require iron 
points, but would fly quite well if merely sharpened at the 
point; which I did not know before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A feathered arrow without a barb,&rdquo; said he, 
&ldquo;is a good weapon, but a barbed arrow without feathers is 
utterly useless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The string of the bow was formed of our piece of whip-cord, 
part of which, as he did not like to cut it, was rolled round the
bow.</p>
<p>Although thus prepared for a start on the morrow, we thought 
it wise to exercise ourselves a little in the use of our weapons 
before starting, so we spent the whole of the next day in 
practising.&nbsp; And it was well we did so, for we found that 
our arms were very imperfect, and that we were far from perfect 
in the use of them.&nbsp; First, Jack found that the bow was much
too strong, and he had to thin it.&nbsp; Also the spear was much 
too heavy, and so had to be reduced in thickness, although 
nothing would induce Peterkin to have it shortened.&nbsp; My 
sling answered very well, but I had fallen so much out of 
practice that my first stone knocked off Peterkin&rsquo;s hat, 
and narrowly missed making a second Goliath of him.&nbsp; 
However, after having spent the whole day in diligent practice, 
we began to find some of our former expertness returning&mdash;at
least Jack and I did.&nbsp; As for Peterkin, being naturally a 
neat-handed boy, he soon handled his spear well, and could run 
full tilt at a cocoa nut, and hit it with great precision once 
out of every five times.</p>
<p>But I feel satisfied that we owed much of our rapid success to
the unflagging energy of Jack, who insisted that, since we had 
made him Captain, we should obey him; and he kept us at work from
morning till night, perseveringly, at the same thing.&nbsp; 
Peterkin wished very much to run about and stick his spear into 
everything he passed; but Jack put up a cocoa nut, and would not 
let him leave off running at that for a moment, except when he 
wanted to rest.&nbsp; We laughed at Jack for this, but we were 
both convinced that it did us much good.</p>
<p>That night we examined and repaired our arms ere we lay down 
to rest, although we were much fatigued, in order that we might 
be in readiness to set out on our expedition at daylight on the 
following morning.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p>Prepare for a journey round the island&mdash;Sagacious 
reflections&mdash;Mysterious appearances and startling 
occurrences.</p>
<p>Scarcely had the sun shot its first ray across the bosom of 
the broad Pacific, when Jack sprang to his feet, and, hallooing 
in Peterkin&rsquo;s ear to awaken him, ran down the beach to take
his customary dip in the sea.&nbsp; We did not, as was our wont, 
bathe that morning in our Water Garden, but, in order to save 
time, refreshed ourselves in the shallow water just opposite the 
bower.&nbsp; Our breakfast was also despatched without loss of 
time, and in less than an hour afterwards all our preparations 
for the journey were completed.</p>
<p>In addition to his ordinary dress, Jack tied a belt of 
cocoa-nut cloth round his waist, into which he thrust the 
axe.&nbsp; I was also advised to put on a belt and carry a short 
cudgel or bludgeon in it; for, as Jack truly remarked, the sling 
would be of little use if we should chance to come to close 
quarters with any wild animal.&nbsp; As for Peterkin, 
notwithstanding that he carried such a long, and I must add, 
frightful-looking spear over his shoulder, we could not prevail 
on him to leave his club behind; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; said he, 
&ldquo;a spear at close quarters is not worth a 
button.&rdquo;&nbsp; I must say that it seemed to me that the 
club was, to use his own style of language, not worth a 
button-hole; for it was all knotted over at the head, something 
like the club which I remember to have observed in picture-books 
of Jack the Giant Killer, besides being so heavy that he required
to grasp it with both hands in order to wield it at all.&nbsp; 
However, he took it with him, and, in this manner we set out upon
our travels.</p>
<p>We did not consider it necessary to carry any food with us, as
we knew that wherever we went we should be certain to fall in 
with cocoa-nut trees; having which, we were amply supplied, as 
Peterkin said, with meat and drink and 
pocket-handkerchiefs!&nbsp; I took the precaution, however, to 
put the burning-glass into my pocket, lest we should want 
fire.</p>
<p>The morning was exceeding lovely.&nbsp; It was one of that 
very still and peaceful sort which made the few noises that we 
heard seem to be <i>quiet</i> noises.&nbsp; I know no other way 
of expressing this idea.&nbsp; Noises which so far from 
interrupting the universal tranquillity of earth, sea, and 
sky&mdash;rather tended to reveal to us how quiet the world 
around us really was.&nbsp; Such sounds as I refer to were, the 
peculiarly melancholy&mdash;yet, it seemed to me, 
cheerful&mdash;plaint of sea-birds floating on the glassy water, 
or sailing in the sky, also the subdued twittering of little 
birds among the bushes, the faint ripples on the beach, and the 
solemn boom of the surf upon the distant coral reef.&nbsp; We 
felt very glad in our hearts as we walked along the sands side by
side.&nbsp; For my part, I felt so deeply overjoyed, that I was 
surprised at my own sensations, and fell into a reverie upon the 
causes of happiness.&nbsp; I came to the conclusion that a state 
of profound peace and repose, both in regard to outward objects 
and within the soul, is the happiest condition in which man can 
be placed; for, although I had many a time been most joyful and 
happy when engaged in bustling, energetic, active pursuits or 
amusements, I never found that such joy or satisfaction was so 
deep or so pleasant to reflect upon as that which I now 
experienced.&nbsp; And I was the more confirmed in this opinion 
when I observed, and, indeed, was told by himself, that 
Peterkin&rsquo;s happiness was also very great; yet he did not 
express this by dancing, as was his wont, nor did he give so much
as a single shout, but walked quietly between us with his eye 
sparkling, and a joyful smile upon his countenance.&nbsp; My 
reader must not suppose that I thought all this in the clear and 
methodical manner in which I have set it down here.&nbsp; These 
thoughts did, indeed, pass through my mind, but they did so in a 
very confused and indefinite manner, for I was young at that 
time, and not much given to deep reflections.&nbsp; Neither did I
consider that the peace whereof I write is not to be found in 
this world&mdash;at least in its perfection, although I have 
since learned that by religion a man may attain to a very great 
degree of it.</p>
<p>I have said that Peterkin walked along the sands between 
us.&nbsp; We had two ways of walking together about our 
island.&nbsp; When we travelled through the woods, we always did 
so in single file, as by this method we advanced with greater 
facility, the one treading in the other&rsquo;s footsteps.&nbsp; 
In such cases Jack always took the lead, Peterkin followed, and I
brought up the rear.&nbsp; But when we travelled along the sands,
which extended almost in an unbroken line of glistening white 
round the island, we marched abreast, as we found this method 
more sociable, and every way more pleasant.&nbsp; Jack, being the
tallest, walked next the sea, and Peterkin marched between us, as
by this arrangement either of us could talk to him or he to us, 
while if Jack and I happened to wish to converse together, we 
could conveniently do so over Peterkin&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; 
Peterkin used to say, in reference to this arrangement, that had 
he been as tall as either of us, our order of march might have 
been the same, for, as Jack often used to scold him for letting 
everything we said to him pass in at one ear and out at the 
other, his head could of course form no interruption to our 
discourse.</p>
<p>We were now fairly started.&nbsp; Half a mile&rsquo;s walk 
conveyed us round a bend in the land which shut out our bower 
from view, and for some time we advanced at a brisk pace without 
speaking, though our eyes were not idle, but noted everything, in
the woods, on the shore, or in the sea, that was 
interesting.&nbsp; After passing the ridge of land that formed 
one side of our valley&mdash;the Valley of the Wreck&mdash;we 
beheld another small vale lying before us in all the luxuriant 
loveliness of tropical vegetation.&nbsp; We had, indeed, seen it 
before from the mountain-top, but we had no idea that it would 
turn out to be so much more lovely when we were close to 
it.&nbsp; We were about to commence the exploration of this 
valley, when Peterkin stopped us, and directed our attention to a
very remarkable appearance in advance along the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s yon, think you?&rdquo; said he, levelling 
his spear, as if he expected an immediate attack from the object 
in question, though it was full half a mile distant.</p>
<p>As he spoke, there appeared a white column above the rocks, as
if of steam or spray.&nbsp; It rose upwards to a height of 
several feet, and then disappeared.&nbsp; Had this been near the 
sea, we would not have been so greatly surprised, as it might in 
that case have been the surf, for at this part of the coast the 
coral reef approached so near to the island that in some parts it
almost joined it.&nbsp; There was therefore no lagoon between, 
and the heavy surf of the ocean beat almost up to the 
rocks.&nbsp; But this white column appeared about fifty yards 
inland.&nbsp; The rocks at the place were rugged, and they 
stretched across the sandy beach into the sea.&nbsp; Scarce had 
we ceased expressing our surprise at this sight, when another 
column flew upwards for a few seconds, not far from the spot 
where the first had been seen, and disappeared; and so, at long 
irregular intervals, these strange sights recurred.&nbsp; We were
now quite sure that the columns were watery or composed of spray,
but what caused them we could not guess, so we determined to go 
and see.</p>
<p>In a few minutes we gained the spot, which was very rugged and
precipitous, and, moreover, quite damp with the falling of the 
spray.&nbsp; We had much ado to pass over dry-shod.&nbsp; The 
ground also was full of holes here and there.&nbsp; Now, while we
stood anxiously waiting for the re-appearance of these 
water-spouts, we heard a low, rumbling sound near us, which 
quickly increased to a gargling and hissing noise, and a moment 
afterwards a thick spout of water burst upwards from a hole in 
the rock, and spouted into the air with much violence, and so 
close to where Jack and I were standing that it nearly touched 
us.&nbsp; We sprang to one side, but not before a cloud of spray 
descended, and drenched us both to the skin.</p>
<p>Peterkin, who was standing farther off, escaped with a few 
drops, and burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter on 
beholding our miserable plight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind your eye!&rdquo; he shouted eagerly, &ldquo;there 
goes another!&rdquo;&nbsp; The words were scarcely out of his 
mouth when there came up a spout from another hole, which served 
us exactly in the same manner as before.</p>
<p>Peterkin now shrieked with laughter; but his merriment was 
abruptly put a stop to by the gurgling noise occurring close to 
where he stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;ll it spout this time, I wonder?&rdquo; he 
said, looking about with some anxiety, and preparing to 
run.&nbsp; Suddenly there came a loud hiss or snort; a fierce 
spout of water burst up between Peterkin&rsquo;s legs, blew him 
off his feet, enveloped him in its spray, and hurled him to the 
ground.&nbsp; He fell with so much violence that we feared he 
must have broken some of his bones, and ran anxiously to his 
assistance; but fortunately he had fallen on a clump of tangled 
herbage, in which he lay sprawling in a most deplorable 
condition.</p>
<p>It was now our turn to laugh; but as we were not yet quite 
sure that he was unhurt, and as we knew not when or where the 
next spout might arise, we assisted him hastily to jump up and 
hurry from the spot.</p>
<p>I may here add, that although I am quite certain that the 
spout of water was very strong, and that it blew Peterkin 
completely off his legs, I am not quite certain of the exact 
height to which it lifted him, being somewhat startled by the 
event, and blinded partially by the spray, so that my power of 
observation was somewhat impaired for the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done now?&rdquo; inquired Peterkin 
ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make a fire, lad, and dry ourselves,&rdquo; replied 
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here is material ready to our hand,&rdquo; said I, 
picking up a dried branch of a tree, as we hurried up to the 
woods.</p>
<p>In about an hour after this mishap our clothes were again 
dried.&nbsp; While they were hanging up before the fire, we 
walked down to the beach, and soon observed that these curious 
spouts took place immediately after the fall of a huge wave, 
never before it; and, moreover, that the spouts did not take 
place excepting when the billow was an extremely large one.&nbsp;
From this we concluded that there must be a subterraneous channel
in the rock into which the water was driven by the larger waves, 
and finding no way of escape except through these small holes, 
was thus forced up violently through them.&nbsp; At any rate, we 
could not conceive any other reason for these strange 
water-spouts, and as this seemed a very simple and probable one, 
we forthwith adopted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Ralph, what&rsquo;s that in the water? is it a 
shark?&rdquo; said Jack, just as we were about to quit the 
place.</p>
<p>I immediately ran to the overhanging ledge of rock, from which
he was looking down into the sea, and bent over it.&nbsp; There I
saw a very faint pale object of a greenish colour, which seemed 
to move slightly while I looked at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a fish of some sort,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo, Peterkin!&rdquo; cried Jack, &ldquo;fetch your 
spear; here&rsquo;s work for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when we tried to reach the object, the spear proved to be 
too short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now,&rdquo; said Peterkin with a sneer, 
&ldquo;you were always telling me it was too long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack now drove the spear forcibly towards the object, and let 
go his hold; but, although it seemed to be well aimed, he must 
have missed, for the handle soon rose again; and when the spear 
was drawn up, there was the pale green object in exactly the same
spot, slowly moving its tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very odd,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>But although it was undoubtedly very odd, and, although Jack 
and all of us plunged the spear at it repeatedly, we could 
neither hit it nor drive it away, so we were compelled to 
continue our journey without discovering what it was.&nbsp; I was
very much perplexed at this strange appearance in the water, and 
could not get it out of my mind for a long time afterwards.&nbsp;
However, I quieted myself by resolving that I would pay a visit 
to it again at some more convenient season.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p>Make discovery of many excellent roots and fruits&mdash;The 
resources of the Coral Island gradually unfolded&mdash;The 
banian-tree&mdash;Another tree which is supported by natural 
planks&mdash;Water-fowl found&mdash;A very remarkable discovery, 
and a very peculiar murder&mdash;We luxuriate on the fat of the 
land.</p>
<p>Our examination of the little valley proved to be altogether 
most satisfactory.&nbsp; We found in it not only similar trees to
those we had already seen in our own valley, but also one or two 
others of a different species.&nbsp; We had also the satisfaction
of discovering a peculiar vegetable, which Jack concluded must 
certainly be that of which he had read as being very common among
the South Sea islanders, and which was named <i>taro</i>.&nbsp; 
Also we found a large supply of yams, and another root like a 
potato in appearance.&nbsp; As these were all quite new to us, we
regarded our lot as a most fortunate one, in being thus cast on 
an island which was so prolific and so well stored with all the 
necessaries of life.&nbsp; Long afterwards we found out that this
island of ours was no better in these respects than thousands of 
other islands in those seas.&nbsp; Indeed, many of them were much
richer and more productive; but that did not render us the less 
grateful for our present good fortune.&nbsp; We each put one of 
these roots in our pocket, intending to use them for our supper; 
of which more hereafter.&nbsp; We also saw many beautiful birds 
here, and traces of some four-footed animal again.&nbsp; 
Meanwhile the sun began to descend, so we returned to the shore, 
and pushed on round the spouting rocks into the next 
valley.&nbsp; This was that valley of which I have spoken as 
running across the entire island.&nbsp; It was by far the largest
and most beautiful that we had yet looked upon.&nbsp; Here were 
trees of every shape and size and hue which it is possible to 
conceive of, many of which we had not seen in the other valleys; 
for, the stream in this valley being larger, and the mould much 
richer than in the Valley of the Wreck, it was clothed with a 
more luxuriant growth of trees and plants.&nbsp; Some trees were 
dark glossy green, others of a rich and warm hue, contrasting 
well with those of a pale light green, which were everywhere 
abundant.&nbsp; Among these we recognised the broad dark heads of
the bread-fruit, with its golden fruit; the pure, silvery foliage
of the candle-nut, and several species which bore a strong 
resemblance to the pine; while here and there, in groups and in 
single trees, rose the tall forms of the cocoa-nut palms, 
spreading abroad, and waving their graceful plumes high above all
the rest, as if they were a superior race of stately giants 
keeping guard over these luxuriant forests.&nbsp; Oh! it was a 
most enchanting scene, and I thanked God for having created such 
delightful spots for the use of man.</p>
<p>Now, while we were gazing around us in silent admiration, Jack
uttered an exclamation of surprise, and, pointing to an object a 
little to one side of us, said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a banian-tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s a banian-tree?&rdquo; inquired 
Peterkin, as we walked towards it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very curious one, as you shall see presently,&rdquo; 
replied Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is called the <i>aoa</i> here, if I
recollect rightly, and has a wonderful peculiarity about 
it.&nbsp; What an enormous one it is, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It</i>!&rdquo; repeated Peterkin; &ldquo;why, there 
are dozens of banians here!&nbsp; What do you mean by talking bad
grammar?&nbsp; Is your philosophy deserting you, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is but one tree here of this kind,&rdquo; 
returned Jack, &ldquo;as you will perceive if you will examine 
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, sure enough, we did find that what we had 
supposed was a forest of trees was in reality only one.&nbsp; Its
bark was of a light colour, and had a shining appearance, the 
leaves being lance-shaped, small, and of a beautiful 
pea-green.&nbsp; But the wonderful thing about it was, that the 
branches, which grew out from the stem horizontally, sent down 
long shoots or fibres to the ground, which, taking root, had 
themselves become trees, and were covered with bark like the tree
itself.&nbsp; Many of these fibres had descended from the 
branches at various distances, and thus supported them on natural
pillars, some of which were so large and strong, that it was not 
easy at first to distinguish the offspring from the parent 
stem.&nbsp; The fibres were of all sizes and in all states of 
advancement, from the pillars we have just mentioned to small 
cords which hung down and were about to take root, and thin brown
threads still far from the ground, which swayed about with every 
motion of wind.&nbsp; In short, it seemed to us that, if there 
were only space afforded to it, this single tree would at length 
cover the whole island.</p>
<p>Shortly after this we came upon another remarkable tree, 
which, as its peculiar formation afterwards proved extremely 
useful to us, merits description.&nbsp; It was a splendid 
chestnut, but its proper name Jack did not know.&nbsp; However, 
there were quantities of fine nuts upon it, some of which we put 
in our pockets.&nbsp; But its stem was the wonderful part of 
it.&nbsp; It rose to about twelve feet without a branch, and was 
not of great thickness; on the contrary, it was remarkably 
slender for the size of the tree; but, to make up for this, there
were four or five wonderful projections in this stem, which I 
cannot better describe than by asking the reader to suppose that 
five planks of two inches thick and three feet broad had been 
placed round the trunk of the tree, with their <i>edges</i> 
closely fixed to it, from the ground up to the branches, and that
these planks bad been covered over with the bark of the tree and 
incorporated with it.&nbsp; In short, they were just natural 
buttresses, without which the stem could not have supported its 
heavy and umbrageous top.&nbsp; We found these chestnuts to be 
very numerous.&nbsp; They grew chiefly on the banks of the 
stream, and were of all sizes.</p>
<p>While we were examining a small tree of this kind, Jack 
chipped a piece off a buttress with his axe, and found the wood 
to be firm and easily cut.&nbsp; He then struck the axe into it 
with all his force, and very soon split it off close to the tree,
first, however, having cut it across transversely above and 
below.&nbsp; By this means he satisfied himself that we could now
obtain short planks, as it were all ready sawn, of any size and 
thickness that we desired; which was a very great discovery 
indeed, perhaps the most important we had yet made.</p>
<p>We now wended our way back to the coast, intending to encamp 
near the beach, as we found that the mosquitoes were troublesome 
in the forest.&nbsp; On our way we could not help admiring the 
birds which flew and chirped around us.&nbsp; Among them we 
observed a pretty kind of paroquet, with a green body, a blue 
head, and a red breast; also a few beautiful turtledoves, and 
several flocks of wood-pigeons.&nbsp; The hues of many of these 
birds were extremely vivid,&mdash;bright green, blue, and 
scarlet, being the prevailing tints.&nbsp; We made several 
attempts throughout the day to bring down one of these, both with
the bow and the sling,&mdash;not for mere sport, but to ascertain
whether they were good for food.&nbsp; But we invariably missed, 
although once or twice we were very near hitting.&nbsp; As 
evening drew on, however, a flock of pigeons flew past.&nbsp; I 
slung a stone into the midst of them at a venture, and had the 
good fortune to kill one.&nbsp; We were startled, soon after, by 
a loud whistling noise above our heads; and on looking up, saw a 
flock of wild ducks making for the coast.&nbsp; We watched these,
and, observing where they alighted, followed them up until we 
came upon a most lovely blue lake, not more than two hundred 
yards long, imbosomed in verdant trees.&nbsp; Its placid surface,
which reflected every leaf and stem, as if in a mirror, was 
covered with various species of wild ducks, feeding among the 
sedges and broad-leaved water-plants which floated on it, while 
numerous birds like water-hens ran to and fro most busily on its 
margin.&nbsp; These all with one accord flew tumultuously away 
the instant we made our appearance.&nbsp; While walking along the
margin we observed fish in the water, but of what sort we could 
not tell.</p>
<p>Now, as we neared the shore, Jack and I said we would go a 
little out of our way to see if we could procure one of those 
ducks; so, directing Peterkin to go straight to the shore and 
kindle a fire, we separated, promising to rejoin him 
speedily.&nbsp; But we did not find the ducks, although we made a
diligent search for half an hour.&nbsp; We were about to retrace 
our steps, when we were arrested by one of the strangest sights 
that we had yet beheld.</p>
<p>Just in front of us, at the distance of about ten yards, grew 
a superb tree, which certainly was the largest we had yet seen on
the island.&nbsp; Its trunk was at least five feet in diameter, 
with a smooth gray bark; above this the spreading branches were 
clothed with light green leaves, amid which were clusters of 
bright yellow fruit, so numerous as to weigh down the boughs with
their great weight.&nbsp; This fruit seemed to be of the plum 
species, of an oblong form, and a good deal larger than the 
magnum bonum plum.&nbsp; The ground at the foot of this tree was 
thickly strewn with the fallen fruit, in the midst of which lay 
sleeping, in every possible attitude, at least twenty hogs of all
ages and sizes, apparently quite surfeited with a recent 
banquet.</p>
<p>Jack and I could scarce restrain our laughter as we gazed at 
these coarse, fat, ill-looking animals, while they lay groaning 
and snoring heavily amid the remains of their supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Ralph,&rdquo; said Jack, in a low whisper, 
&ldquo;put a stone in your sling,&mdash;a good big one,&mdash;and
let fly at that fat fellow with his back toward you.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;ll try to put an arrow into yon little pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we had better put them up 
first?&rdquo; I whispered; &ldquo;it seems cruel to kill them 
while asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I wanted <i>sport</i>, Ralph, I would certainly set 
them up; but as we only want <i>pork</i>, we&rsquo;ll let them 
lie.&nbsp; Besides, we&rsquo;re not sure of killing them; so, 
fire away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus admonished, I slung my stone with so good aim that it 
went bang against the hog&rsquo;s flank as if against the head of
a drum; but it had no other effect than that of causing the 
animal to start to its feet, with a frightful yell of surprise, 
and scamper away.&nbsp; At the same instant Jack&rsquo;s bow 
twanged, and the arrow pinned the little pig to the ground by the
ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed, after all,&rdquo; cried Jack, 
darting forward with uplifted axe, while the little pig uttered a
loud squeal, tore the arrow from the ground, and ran away with 
it, along with the whole drove, into the bushes and disappeared, 
though we heard them screaming long afterwards in the 
distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very provoking, now,&rdquo; said Jack, 
rubbing the point of his nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; I replied, stroking my chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we must make haste and rejoin Peterkin,&rdquo; 
said Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting late.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
And, without further remark, we threaded our way quickly through 
the woods towards the shore.</p>
<p>When we reached it, we found wood laid out, the fire lighted 
and beginning to kindle up, with other signs of preparation for 
our encampment, but Peterkin was nowhere to be found.&nbsp; We 
wondered very much at this; but Jack suggested that he might have
gone to fetch water; so he gave a shout to let him know that we 
had arrived, and sat down upon a rock, while I threw off my 
jacket and seized the axe, intending to split up one or two 
billets of wood.&nbsp; But I had scarce moved from the spot when,
in the distance, we heard a most appalling shriek, which was 
followed up by a chorus of yells from the hogs, and a loud 
&ldquo;hurrah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do believe,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that Peterkin has 
met with the hogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Greek meets Greek,&rdquo; said Jack, 
soliloquizing, &ldquo;then comes the tug of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted Peterkin in the distance.</p>
<p>We turned hastily towards the direction whence the sound came,
and soon descried Peterkin walking along the beach towards us 
with a little pig transfixed on the end of his long spear!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done, my boy!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, slapping him 
on the shoulder when he came up, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the best 
shot amongst us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here Jack!&rdquo; cried Peterkin, as he disengaged
the animal from his spear.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you recognise that 
hole?&rdquo; said he, pointing to the pig&rsquo;s ear; &ldquo;and
are you familiar with this arrow, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare!&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you do,&rdquo; interrupted Peterkin; 
&ldquo;but, pray, restrain your declarations at this time, and 
let&rsquo;s have supper, for I&rsquo;m uncommonly hungry, I can 
tell you; and it&rsquo;s no joke to charge a whole herd of swine 
with their great-grandmother bristling like a giant porcupine at 
the head of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now set about preparing supper; and, truly, a good display 
of viands we made, when all was laid out on a flat rock in the 
light of the blazing fire.&nbsp; There was, first of all, the 
little pig; then there was the taro-root, and the yam, and the 
potato, and six plums; and, lastly, the wood-pigeon.&nbsp; To 
these Peterkin added a bit of sugar-cane, which he had cut from a
little patch of that plant which he had found not long after 
separating from us; &ldquo;and,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the patch 
was somewhat in a square form, which convinces me it must have 
been planted by man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; replied Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;From all
we have seen, I&rsquo;m inclined to think that some of the 
savages must have dwelt here long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We found no small difficulty in making up our minds how we 
were to cook the pig.&nbsp; None of us had ever cut up one 
before, and we did not know exactly how to begin; besides, we had
nothing but the axe to do it with, our knife having been 
forgotten.&nbsp; At last Jack started up and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us waste more time talking about it, 
boys.&nbsp; Hold it up, Peterkin.&nbsp; There, lay the hind leg 
on this block of wood, so;&rdquo; and he cut it off, with a large
portion of the haunch, at a single blow of the axe.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Now the other,&mdash;that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And 
having thus cut off the two hind legs, he made several deep 
gashes in them, thrust a sharp-pointed stick through each, and 
stuck them up before the blaze to roast.&nbsp; The wood-pigeon 
was then split open, quite flat, washed clean in salt water, and 
treated in a similar manner.&nbsp; While these were cooking, we 
scraped a hole in the sand and ashes under the fire, into which 
we put our vegetables, and covered them up.</p>
<p>The taro-root was of an oval shape, about ten inches long and 
four or five thick.&nbsp; It was of a mottled-gray colour, and 
had a thick rind.&nbsp; We found it somewhat like an Irish 
potato, and exceedingly good.&nbsp; The yam was roundish, and had
a rough brown skin.&nbsp; It was very sweet and 
well-flavoured.&nbsp; The potato, we were surprised to find, was 
quite sweet and exceedingly palatable, as also were the plums; 
and, indeed, the pork and pigeon too, when we came to taste 
them.&nbsp; Altogether this was decidedly the most luxurious 
supper we had enjoyed for many a day; and Jack said it was 
out-of-sight better than we ever got on board ship; and Peterkin 
said he feared that if we should remain long on the island he 
would infallibly become a glutton or an epicure: whereat Jack 
remarked that he need not fear that, for he was <i>both</i> 
already!&nbsp; And so, having eaten our fill, not forgetting to 
finish off with a plum, we laid ourselves comfortably down to 
sleep upon a couch of branches under the overhanging ledge of a 
coral rock.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p>Effects of over-eating, and reflections thereon&mdash;Humble 
advice regarding cold water&mdash;The &ldquo;horrible cry&rdquo; 
accounted for&mdash;The curious birds called 
penguins&mdash;Peculiarity of the cocoa nut palm&mdash;Questions 
on the formation of coral islands&mdash;Mysterious 
footsteps&mdash;Strange discoveries and sad sights.</p>
<p>When we awoke on the following morning, we found that the sun 
was already a good way above the horizon, so I came to the 
conclusion that a heavy supper is not conducive to early 
rising.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we felt remarkably strong and well, 
and much disposed to have our breakfast.&nbsp; First, however, we
had our customary morning bathe, which refreshed us greatly.</p>
<p>I have often wondered very much in after years that the 
inhabitants of my own dear land did not make more frequent use of
this most charming element, water.&nbsp; I mean in the way of 
cold bathing.&nbsp; Of course, I have perceived that it is not 
convenient for them to go into the sea or the rivers in winter, 
as we used to do on the Coral Island; but then, I knew from 
experience that a large washing-tub and a sponge do form a most 
pleasant substitute.&nbsp; The feelings of freshness, of 
cleanliness, of vigour, and extreme hilarity, that always 
followed my bathes in the sea, and even, when in England, my 
ablutions in the wash-tub, were so delightful, that I would 
sooner have gone without my breakfast than without my bathe in 
cold water.&nbsp; My readers will forgive me for asking whether 
they are in the habit of bathing thus every morning; and if they 
answer &ldquo;No,&rdquo; they will pardon me for recommending 
them to begin at once.&nbsp; Of late years, since retiring from 
the stirring life of adventure which I have led so long in 
foreign climes, I have heard of a system called the 
cold-water-cure.&nbsp; Now, I do not know much about that system,
so I do not mean to uphold it, neither do I intend to run it 
down.&nbsp; Perhaps, in reference to it, I may just hint that 
there may be too much of a good thing.&nbsp; I know not; but of 
this I am quite certain, that there may also be too little of a 
good thing; and the great delight I have had in cold bathing 
during the course of my adventurous career inclines me to think 
that it is better to risk taking too much than to content 
one&rsquo;s self with too little.&nbsp; Such is my opinion, 
derived from much experience; but I put it before my readers with
the utmost diffidence and with profound modesty, knowing that it 
may possibly jar with their feelings of confidence in their own 
ability to know and judge as to what is best and fittest in 
reference to their own affairs.&nbsp; But, to return from this 
digression, for which I humbly crave forgiveness.</p>
<p>We had not advanced on our journey much above a mile or so, 
and were just beginning to feel the pleasant glow that usually 
accompanies vigorous exercise, when, on turning a point that 
revealed to us a new and beautiful cluster of islands, we were 
suddenly arrested by the appalling cry which had so alarmed us a 
few nights before.&nbsp; But this time we were by no means so 
much alarmed as on the previous occasion, because, whereas at 
that time it was night, now it was day; and I have always found, 
though I am unable to account for it, that daylight banishes many
of the fears that are apt to assail us in the dark.</p>
<p>On hearing the sound, Peterkin instantly threw forward his 
spear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what can it be?&rdquo; said he, looking round at 
Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell you what it is, if we are to go on 
being pulled up in a constant state of horror and astonishment, 
as we have been for the last week, the sooner we&rsquo;re out 
o&rsquo; this island the better, notwithstanding the yams and 
lemonade, and pork and plums!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peterkin&rsquo;s remark was followed by a repetition of the 
cry, louder than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It comes from one of these islands,&rdquo; said 
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be the ghost of a jackass, then,&rdquo; said 
Peterkin, &ldquo;for I never heard anything so like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all turned our eyes towards the cluster of islands, where, 
on the largest, we observed curious objects moving on the 
shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soldiers they are,&mdash;that&rsquo;s flat!&rdquo; 
cried Peterkin, gazing at them in the utmost amazement.</p>
<p>And, in truth, Peterkin&rsquo;s remark seemed to me to be 
correct; for, at the distance from which we saw them, they 
appeared to be an army of soldiers.&nbsp; There they stood, rank 
and file, in lines and in squares, marching and countermarching, 
with blue coats and white trousers.&nbsp; While we were looking 
at them, the dreadful cry came again over the water, and Peterkin
suggested that it must be a regiment sent out to massacre the 
natives in cold blood.&nbsp; At this remark Jack laughed and 
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Peterkin, they are penguins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penguins?&rdquo; repeated Peterkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, penguins, Peterkin, penguins,&mdash;nothing more or
less than big sea-birds, as you shall see one of these days, when
we pay them a visit in our boat, which I mean to set about 
building the moment we return to our bower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, then, our dreadful yelling ghosts and our murdering
army of soldiers,&rdquo; remarked Peterkin, &ldquo;have dwindled 
down to penguins,&mdash;big sea-birds!&nbsp; Very good.&nbsp; 
Then I propose that we continue our journey as fast as possible, 
lest our island should be converted into a dream before we get 
completely round it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, as we continued on our way, I pondered much over this new
discovery, and the singular appearance of these birds, of which 
Jack could only give us a very slight and vague account; and I 
began to long to commence to our boat, in order that we might go 
and inspect them more narrowly.&nbsp; But by degrees these 
thoughts left me, and I began to be much taken up again with the 
interesting peculiarities of the country which we were passing 
through.</p>
<p>The second night we passed in a manner somewhat similar to the
first, at about two-thirds of the way round the island, as we 
calculated, and we hoped to sleep on the night following at our 
bower.&nbsp; I will not here note so particularly all that we 
said and saw during the course of this second day, as we did not 
make any further discoveries of great importance.&nbsp; The shore
along which we travelled, and the various parts of the woods 
through which we passed, were similar to those which have been 
already treated of.&nbsp; There were one or two observations that
we made, however, and these were as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>We saw that, while many of the large fruit-bearing trees grew 
only in the valleys, and some of them only near the banks of the 
streams, where the soil was peculiarly rich, the cocoa-nut palm 
grew in every place whatsoever,&mdash;not only on the hill sides,
but also on the sea shore, and even, as has been already stated, 
on the coral reef itself, where the soil, if we may use the name,
was nothing better than loose sand mingled with broken shells and
coral rock.&nbsp; So near to the sea, too, did this useful tree 
grow, that in many places its roots were washed by the spray from
the breakers.&nbsp; Yet we found the trees growing thus on the 
sands to be quite as luxuriant as those growing in the valleys, 
and the fruit as good and refreshing also.&nbsp; Besides this, I 
noticed that, on the summit of the high mountain, which we once 
more ascended at a different point from our first ascent, were 
found abundance of shells and broken coral formations, which Jack
and I agreed proved either that this island must have once been 
under the sea, or that the sea must once have been above the 
island.&nbsp; In other words, that as shells and coral could not 
possibly climb to the mountain top, they must have been washed 
upon it while the mountain top was on a level with the sea.&nbsp;
We pondered this very much; and we put to ourselves the question,
&ldquo;What raised the island to its present height above the 
sea?&rdquo;&nbsp; But to this we could by no means give to 
ourselves a satisfactory reply.&nbsp; Jack thought it might have 
been blown up by a volcano; and Peterkin said he thought it must 
have jumped up of its own accord!&nbsp; We also noticed, what had
escaped us before, that the solid rocks of which the island was 
formed were quite different from the live coral rocks on the 
shore, where the wonderful little insects were continually 
working.&nbsp; They seemed, indeed, to be of the sauce 
material,&mdash;a substance like limestone; but, while the coral 
rocks were quite full of minute cells in which the insects lived,
the other rocks inland were hard and solid, without the 
appearance of cells at all.&nbsp; Our thoughts and conversations 
on this subject were sometimes so profound that Peterkin said we 
should certainly get drowned in them at last, even although we 
were such good divers!&nbsp; Nevertheless we did not allow his 
pleasantry on this and similar points to deter us from making our
notes and observations as we went along.</p>
<p>We found several more droves of hogs in the woods, but 
abstained from killing any of them, having more than sufficient 
for our present necessities.&nbsp; We saw also many of their 
foot-prints in this neighbourhood.&nbsp; Among these we also 
observed the footprints of a smaller animal, which we examined 
with much care, but could form no certain opinion as to 
them.&nbsp; Peterkin thought they were those of a little dog, but
Jack and I thought differently.&nbsp; We became very curious on 
this matter, the more so that we observed these foot-prints to 
lie scattered about in one locality, as if the animal which had 
made them was wandering round about in a very irregular manner, 
and without any object in view.&nbsp; Early in the forenoon of 
our third day we observed these footprints to be much more 
numerous than ever, and in one particular spot they diverged off 
into the woods in a regular beaten track, which was, however, so 
closely beset with bushes, that we pushed through it with 
difficulty.&nbsp; We had now become so anxious to find out what 
animal this was, and where it went to, that we determined to 
follow the track, and, if possible, clear up the mystery.&nbsp; 
Peterkin said, in a bantering tone, that he was sure it would be 
cleared up as usual in some frightfully simple way, and prove to 
be no mystery at all!</p>
<p>The beaten track seemed much too large to have been formed by 
the animal itself, and we concluded that some larger animal had 
made it, and that the smaller one made use of it.&nbsp; But 
everywhere the creeping plants and tangled bushes crossed our 
path, so that we forced our way along with some difficulty.&nbsp;
Suddenly, as we came upon an open space, we heard a faint cry, 
and observed a black animal standing in the track before us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wild-cat!&rdquo; cried Jack, fitting an arrow to his 
bow, and discharging it so hastily that he missed the animal, and
hit the earth about half a foot to one side of it.&nbsp; To our 
surprise the wild-cat did not fly, but walked slowly towards the 
arrow, and snuffed at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the most comical wild-cat I ever 
saw!&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tame wild-cat, I think,&rdquo; said 
Peterkin, levelling his spear to make a charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried I, laying my hand on his shoulder; 
&ldquo;I do believe the poor beast is blind.&nbsp; See, it 
strikes against the branches as it walks along.&nbsp; It must be 
a very old one;&rdquo; and I hastened towards it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only think,&rdquo; said Peterkin, with a suppressed 
laugh, &ldquo;of a superannuated wild-cat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now found that the poor cat was not only blind, or nearly 
so, but extremely deaf, as it did not hear our footsteps until we
were quite close behind it.&nbsp; Then it sprang round, and, 
putting up its back and tail, while the black hair stood all on 
end, uttered a hoarse mew and a fuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor thing,&rdquo; said Peterkin, gently extending his 
hand, and endeavouring to pat the cat&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Poor pussy; chee, chee, chee; puss, puss, puss; cheetie 
pussy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner did the cat hear these sounds than all signs of 
anger fled, and, advancing eagerly to Peterkin, it allowed itself
to be stroked, and rubbed itself against his legs, purring loudly
all the time, and showing every symptom of the most extreme 
delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no more a wild cat than I am!&rdquo; cried 
Peterkin, taking it in his arms.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite 
tame.&nbsp; Poor pussy, cheetie pussy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now crowded around Peterkin, and were not a little 
surprised, and, to say truth, a good deal affected, by the sight 
of the poor animal&rsquo;s excessive joy.&nbsp; It rubbed its 
head against Peterkin&rsquo;s cheek, licked his chin, and thrust 
its head almost violently into his neck, while it purred more 
loudly than I ever heard a cat purr before, and appeared to be so
much overpowered by its feelings, that it occasionally mewed and 
purred almost in the same breath.&nbsp; Such demonstrations of 
joy and affection led us at once to conclude that this poor cat 
must have known man before, and we conjectured that it had been 
left either accidentally or by design on the island many years 
ago, and was now evincing its extreme joy at meeting once more 
with human beings.&nbsp; While we were fondling the cat and 
talking about it, Jack glanced round the open space in the midst 
of which we stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; exclaimed he; &ldquo;this looks something
like a clearing.&nbsp; The axe has been at work here.&nbsp; Just 
look at these tree-stumps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now turned to examine these, and, without doubt, we found 
trees that had been cut down here and there, also stumps and 
broken branches; all of which, however, were completely covered 
over with moss, and bore evidence of having been in this 
condition for some years.&nbsp; No human foot-prints were to be 
seen, either on the track or among the bushes; but those of the 
cat were found everywhere.&nbsp; We now determined to follow up 
the track as far as it went, and Peterkin put the cat down; but 
it seemed to be so weak, and mewed so very pitifully, that he 
took it up again and carried it in his arms, where, in a few 
minutes, it fell sound asleep.</p>
<p>About ten yards farther on, the felled trees became more 
numerous, and the track, diverging to the right, followed for a 
short space the banks of a stream.&nbsp; Suddenly we came to a 
spot where once must have been a rude bridge, the stones of which
were scattered in the stream, and those on each bank entirely 
covered over with moss.&nbsp; In silent surprise and expectancy 
we continued to advance, and, a few yards farther on, beheld, 
under the shelter of some bread-fruit trees, a small hut or 
cottage.&nbsp; I cannot hope to convey to my readers a very 
correct idea of the feelings that affected us on witnessing this 
unexpected sight.&nbsp; We stood for a long time in silent 
wonder, for there was a deep and most melancholy stillness about 
the place that quite overpowered us; and when we did at length 
speak, it was in subdued whispers, as if we were surrounded by 
some awful or supernatural influence.&nbsp; Even Peterkin&rsquo;s
voice, usually so quick and lively on all occasions, was hushed 
now; for there was a dreariness about this silent, lonely, 
uninhabited cottage,&mdash;so strange in its appearance, so far 
away from the usual dwellings of man, so old, decayed, and 
deserted in its aspect,&mdash;that fell upon our spirits like a 
thick cloud, and blotted out as with a pall the cheerful sunshine
that had filled us since the commencement of our tour round the 
island.</p>
<p>The hut or cottage was rude and simple in its 
construction.&nbsp; It was not more than twelve feet long by ten 
feet broad, and about seven or eight feet high.&nbsp; It had one 
window, or rather a small frame in which a window might, perhaps,
once have been, but which was now empty.&nbsp; The door was 
exceedingly low, and formed of rough boards, and the roof was 
covered with broad cocoa-nut and plantain leaves.&nbsp; But every
part of it was in a state of the utmost decay.&nbsp; Moss and 
green matter grew in spots all over it.&nbsp; The woodwork was 
quite perforated with holes; the roof had nearly fallen in, and 
appeared to be prevented from doing so altogether by the thick 
matting of creeping-plants and the interlaced branches which 
years of neglect had allowed to cover it almost entirely; while 
the thick, luxuriant branches of the bread-fruit and other trees 
spread above it, and flung a deep, sombre shadow over the spot, 
as if to guard it from the heat and the light of day.&nbsp; We 
conversed long and in whispers about this strange habitation ere 
we ventured to approach it; and when at length we did so it was, 
at least on my part, with feelings of awe.</p>
<p>At first Jack endeavoured to peep in at the window, but from 
the deep shadow of the trees already mentioned, and the gloom 
within, he could not clearly discern objects; so we lifted the 
latch and pushed open the door.&nbsp; We observed that the latch 
was made of iron, and almost eaten away with rust.&nbsp; In the 
like condition were also the hinges, which creaked as the door 
swung back.&nbsp; On entering, we stood still and gazed around 
us, while we were much impressed with the dreary stillness of the
room.&nbsp; But what we saw there surprised and shocked us not a 
little.&nbsp; There was no furniture in the apartment save a 
little wooden stool and an iron pot, the latter almost eaten 
through with rust.&nbsp; In the corner farthest from the door was
a low bedstead, on which lay two skeletons, imbedded in a little 
heap of dry dust.&nbsp; With beating hearts we went forward to 
examine them.&nbsp; One was the skeleton of a man, the other that
of a dog, which was extended close beside that of the man, with 
its head resting on his bosom</p>
<p>Now we were very much concerned about this discovery, and 
could scarce refrain from tears on beholding these sad 
remains.&nbsp; After some time, we began to talk about what we 
had seen, and to examine in and around the hut, in order to 
discover some clue to the name or history of this poor man, who 
had thus died in solitude, with none to mourn his loss save his 
cat and his faithful dog.&nbsp; But we found 
nothing,&mdash;neither a book nor a scrap of paper.&nbsp; We 
found, however, the decayed remnants of what appeared to have 
been clothing, and an old axe.&nbsp; But none of these things 
bore marks of any kind; and, indeed, they were so much decayed as
to convince us that they had lain in the condition in which we 
found them for many years.</p>
<p>This discovery now accounted to us for the tree stump at the 
top of the mountain with the initials cut on it; also for the 
patch of sugar-cane and other traces of man which we had met with
in the course of our rambles over the island.&nbsp; And we were 
much saddened by the reflection that the lot of this poor 
wanderer might possibly be our own, after many years&rsquo; 
residence on the island, unless we should be rescued by the visit
of some vessel or the arrival of natives.&nbsp; Having no clue 
whatever to account for the presence of this poor human being in 
such a lonely spot, we fell to conjecturing what could have 
brought him there.&nbsp; I was inclined to think that he must 
have been a shipwrecked sailor, whose vessel had been lost here, 
and all the crew been drowned except himself and his dog and 
cat.&nbsp; But Jack thought it more likely that he had run away 
from his vessel, and had taken the dog and cat to keep him 
company.&nbsp; We were also much occupied in our minds with the 
wonderful difference between the cat and the dog.&nbsp; For here 
we saw that while the one perished, like a loving friend, by its 
master&rsquo;s side, with its head resting on his bosom, the 
other had sought to sustain itself by prowling abroad in the 
forest, and had lived in solitude to a good old age.&nbsp; 
However, we did not conclude from this that the cat was destitute
of affection, for we could not forget its emotions on first 
meeting with us; but we saw from this, that the dog had a great 
deal more of generous love in its nature than the cat, because it
not only found it impossible to live after the death of its 
master, but it must needs, when it came to die, crawl to his side
and rest its head upon his lifeless breast.</p>
<p>While we were thinking on these things, and examining into 
everything about the room, we were attracted by an exclamation 
from Peterkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Jack,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;here is something 
that will be of use to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Jack, hastening across the 
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old pistol,&rdquo; replied Peterkin, holding up the 
weapon, which he had just pulled from under a heap of broken wood
and rubbish that lay in a corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, indeed, might have been useful,&rdquo; said Jack,
examining it, &ldquo;if we had any powder; but I suspect the bow 
and the sling will prove more serviceable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, I forgot that,&rdquo; said Peterkin; &ldquo;but 
we may as well take it with us, for the flint will serve to 
strike fire with when the sun does not shine.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt="A saddening discovery" src="images/p136s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>After having spent more than an hour at this place without 
discovering anything of further interest, Peterkin took up the 
old cat, which had lain very contentedly asleep on the stool 
whereon he had placed it, and we prepared to take our 
departure.&nbsp; In leaving the hut, Jack stumbled heavily 
against the door-post, which was so much decayed as to break 
across, and the whole fabric of the hut seemed ready to tumble 
about our ears.&nbsp; This put into our heads that we might as 
well pull it down, and so form a mound over the skeleton.&nbsp; 
Jack, therefore, with his axe, cut down the other door-post, 
which, when it was done, brought the whole hut in ruins to the 
ground, and thus formed a grave to the bones of the poor recluse 
and his dog.&nbsp; Then we left the spot, having brought away the
iron pot, the pistol, and the old axe, as they might be of much 
use to us hereafter.</p>
<p>During the rest of this day we pursued our journey, and 
examined the other end of the large valley, which we found to be 
so much alike to the parts already described, that I shall not 
recount the particulars of what we saw in this place.&nbsp; I 
may, however, remark, that we did not quite recover our former 
cheerful spirits until we arrived at our bower, which we did late
in the evening, and found everything just in the same condition 
as we had left it three days before.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p>Something wrong with the tank&mdash;Jack&rsquo;s wisdom and 
Peterkin&rsquo;s impertinence&mdash;Wonderful behaviour of a 
crab&mdash;Good wishes for those who dwell far from the 
sea&mdash;Jack commences to build a little boat.</p>
<p>Rest is sweet as well for the body as for the mind.&nbsp; 
During my long experience, amid the vicissitudes of a chequered 
life, I have found that periods of profound rest at certain 
intervals, in addition to the ordinary hours of repose, are 
necessary to the wellbeing of man.&nbsp; And the nature as well 
as the period of this rest varies, according to the different 
temperaments of individuals, and the peculiar circumstances in 
which they may chance to be placed.&nbsp; To those who work with 
their minds, bodily labour is rest.&nbsp; To those who labour 
with the body, deep sleep is rest.&nbsp; To the downcast, the 
weary, and the sorrowful, joy and peace are rest.&nbsp; Nay, 
further, I think that to the gay, the frivolous, the reckless, 
when sated with pleasures that cannot last, even sorrow proves to
be rest of a kind, although, perchance, it were better that I 
should call it relief than rest.&nbsp; There is, indeed, but one 
class of men to whom rest is denied.&nbsp; There is no rest to 
the wicked.&nbsp; At this I do but hint, however, as I treat not 
of that rest which is spiritual, but, more particularly, of that 
which applies to the mind and to the body.</p>
<p>Of this rest we stood much in need on our return home, and we 
found it exceedingly sweet, when we indulged in it, after 
completing the journey just related.&nbsp; It had not, indeed, 
been a very long journey, nevertheless we had pursued it so 
diligently that our frames were not a little prostrated.&nbsp; 
Our minds were also very much exhausted in consequence of the 
many surprises, frequent alarms, and much profound thought, to 
which they had been subjected; so that when we lay down on the 
night of our return under the shelter of the bower, we fell 
immediately into very deep repose.&nbsp; I can state this with 
much certainty, for Jack afterwards admitted the fact, and 
Peterkin, although he stoutly denied it, I heard snoring loudly 
at least two minutes after lying down.&nbsp; In this condition we
remained all night and the whole of the following day without 
awaking once, or so much as moving our positions.&nbsp; When we 
did awake it was near sunset, and we were all in such a state of 
lassitude that we merely rose to swallow a mouthful of 
food.&nbsp; As Peterkin remarked, in the midst of a yawn, we took
breakfast at tea-time, and then went to bed again, where we lay 
till the following forenoon.</p>
<p>After this we arose very greatly refreshed, but much alarmed 
lest we had lost count of a day.&nbsp; I say we were much alarmed
on this head, for we had carefully kept count of the days since 
we were cast upon our island, in order that we might remember the
Sabbath-day, which day we had hitherto with one accord kept as a 
day of rest, and refrained from all work whatsoever.&nbsp; 
However, on considering the subject, we all three entertained the
same opinion as to how long we had slept, and so our minds were 
put at ease.</p>
<p>We now hastened to our Water Garden to enjoy a bathe, and to 
see how did the animals which I had placed in the tank.&nbsp; We 
found the garden more charming, pelucid, and inviting than ever, 
and Jack and I plunged into its depth, and gambolled among its 
radiant coral groves; while Peterkin wallowed at the surface, and
tried occasionally to kick us as we passed below.&nbsp; Having 
dressed, I then hastened to the tank; but what was my surprise 
and grief to find nearly all the animals dead, and the water in a
putrid condition!&nbsp; I was greatly distressed at this, and 
wondered what could be the cause of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you precious humbug,&rdquo; said Peterkin, coming 
up to me, &ldquo;how could you expect it to be otherwise?&nbsp; 
When fishes are accustomed to live in the Pacific Ocean, how can 
you expect them to exist in a hole like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Peterkin,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;there seems 
to be truth in what you say.&nbsp; Nevertheless, now I think of 
it, there must be some error in your reasoning; for, if I put in 
but a few very small animals, they will bear the same proportion 
to this pond that the millions of fish bear to the 
ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Jack,&rdquo; cried Peterkin, waving his hand, 
&ldquo;come here, like a good fellow.&nbsp; Ralph is actually 
talking philosophy.&nbsp; Do come to our assistance, for 
he&rsquo;s out o&rsquo; sight beyond me already!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; inquired Jack, coming 
up, while he endeavoured to scrub his long hair dry with a towel 
of cocoa-nut cloth.</p>
<p>I repeated my thoughts to Jack, who, I was happy to find, 
quite agreed with me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your best plan,&rdquo; he 
said, &ldquo;will be to put very few animals at first into your 
tank, and add more as you find it will bear them.&nbsp; And look 
here,&rdquo; he added, pointing to the sides of the tank, which, 
for the space of two inches above the water-level, were incrusted
with salt, &ldquo;you must carry your philosophy a little 
farther, Ralph.&nbsp; That water has evaporated so much that it 
is too salt for anything to live in.&nbsp; You will require to 
add <i>fresh</i> water now and then, in order to keep it at the 
same degree of saltness as the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true, Jack, that never struck me before,&rdquo; 
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, now I think of it,&rdquo; continued Jack, 
&ldquo;it seems to me that the surest way of arranging your tank 
so as to get it to keep pure and in good condition, will be to 
imitate the ocean in it.&nbsp; In fact make it a miniature 
Pacific.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see how you can hope to succeed 
unless you do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most true,&rdquo; said I, pondering what my companion 
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I fear that that will be very 
difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; cried Jack, rolling his towel up 
into a ball, and throwing it into the face of Peterkin, who had 
been grinning and winking at him during the last five 
minutes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not at all.&nbsp; Look here.&nbsp; There is
water of a certain saltness in the sea; well, fill your tank with
sea water, and keep it at that saltness by marking the height at 
which the water stands on the sides.&nbsp; When it evaporates a 
little, pour in <i>fresh</i> water from the brook till it comes 
up to the mark, and then it will be right, for the salt does not 
evaporate with the water.&nbsp; Then, there&rsquo;s lots of 
sea-weed in the sea;&mdash;well, go and get one or two bits of 
sea-weed, and put them into your tank.&nbsp; Of course the weed 
must be alive, and growing to little stones; or you can chip a 
bit off the rocks with the weed sticking to it.&nbsp; Then, if 
you like, you can throw a little sand and gravel into your tank, 
and the thing&rsquo;s complete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, not quite,&rdquo; said Peterkin, who had been 
gravely attentive to this off-hand advice, &ldquo;not quite; you 
must first make three little men to dive in it before it can be 
said to be perfect, and that would be rather difficult, I fear, 
for two of them would require to be philosophers.&nbsp; But 
hallo! what&rsquo;s this?&nbsp; I say, Ralph, look here.&nbsp; 
There&rsquo;s one o&rsquo; your crabs up to something 
uncommon.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s performing the most remarkable 
operation for a crab I ever saw,&mdash;taking off its coat, I do 
believe, before going to bed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We hastily stooped over the tank, and certainly were not a 
little amused at the conduct of one of the crabs which still 
survived it companions.&nbsp; It was one of the common small 
crabs, like to those that are found running about everywhere on 
the coasts of England.&nbsp; While we gazed at it, we observed 
its back to split away from the lower part of its body, and out 
of the gap thus formed came a soft lump which moved and writhed 
unceasingly.&nbsp; This lump continued to increase in size until 
it appeared like a bunch of crab&rsquo;s legs: and, indeed, such 
it proved in a very few minutes to be; for the points of the toes
were at length extricated from this hole in its back, the legs 
spread out, the body followed, and the crab walked away quite 
entire, even to the points of its nipper-claws, leaving a 
perfectly entire shell behind it, so that, when we looked, it 
seemed as though there were two complete crabs instead of 
one!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; exclaimed Peterkin, drawing a long breath,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve <i>heard</i> of a man jumping out of his skin 
and sitting down in his skeleton in order to cool himself, but I 
never expected to <i>see</i> a crab do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were, in truth, much amazed at this spectacle, and the more
so when we observed that the new crab was larger than the crab 
that it came out of.&nbsp; It was also quite soft, but by next 
morning its skin had hardened into a good shell.&nbsp; We came 
thus to know that crabs grow in this way, and not by the growing 
of their shells, as we had always thought before we saw this 
wonderful operation.</p>
<p>Now I considered well the advice which Jack had given me about
preparing my tank, and the more I thought of it, the more I came 
to regard it as very sound and worthy of being acted on.&nbsp; So
I forthwith put his plan in execution, and found it to answer 
excellently well, indeed much beyond my expectation; for I found 
that after a little experience had taught me the proper 
proportion of sea-weed and animals to put into a certain amount 
of water, the tank needed no farther attendance; and, moreover, I
did not require ever afterwards to renew or change the sea-water,
but only to add a very little fresh water from the brook, now and
then, as the other evaporated.&nbsp; I therefore concluded that 
if I had been suddenly conveyed, along with my tank, into some 
region where there was no salt sea at all, my little sea and my 
sea-fish would have continued to thrive and to prosper 
notwithstanding.&nbsp; This made me greatly to desire that those 
people in the world who live far inland might know of my 
wonderful tank, and, by having materials like to those of which 
it was made conveyed to them, thus be enabled to watch the habits
of those most mysterious animals that reside in the sea, and 
examine with their own eyes the wonders of the great deep.</p>
<p>For many days after this, while Peterkin and Jack were busily 
employed in building a little boat out of the curious natural 
planks of the chestnut tree, I spent much of my time in examining
with the burning-glass the marvellous operations that were 
constantly going on in my tank.&nbsp; Here I saw those anemones 
which cling, like little red, yellow, and green blobs of jelly, 
to the rocks, put forth, as it were, a multitude of arms and wait
till little fish or other small animalcules unwarily touched 
them, when they would instantly seize them, fold arm after arm 
around their victims, and so engulf them in their stomachs.&nbsp;
Here I saw the ceaseless working of those little coral insects 
whose efforts have encrusted the islands of the Pacific with vast
rocks, and surrounded them with enormous reefs.&nbsp; And I 
observed that many of these insects, though extremely minute, 
were very beautiful, coming out of their holes in a circle of 
fine threads, and having the form of a shuttle-cock.&nbsp; Here I
saw curious little barnacles opening a hole in their backs and 
constantly putting out a thin feathery hand, with which, I doubt 
not, they dragged their food into their mouths.&nbsp; Here, also,
I saw those crabs which have shells only on the front of their 
bodies, but no shell whatever on their remarkably tender tails, 
so that, in order to find a protection to them, they thrust them 
into the empty shells of wilks, or some such fish, and when they 
grow too big for one, change into another.&nbsp; But, most 
curious of all, I saw an animal which had the wonderful power, 
when it became ill, of casting its stomach and its teeth away 
from it, and getting an entirely new set in the course of a few 
months!&nbsp; All this I saw, and a great deal more, by means of 
my tank and my burning-glass, but I refrain from setting down 
more particulars here, as I have still much to tell of the 
adventures that befell us while we remained on this island.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p>Notable discovery at the spouting cliffs&mdash;The mysterious 
green monster explained&mdash;We are thrown into unutterable 
terror by the idea that Jack is drowned&mdash;The Diamond 
Cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Jack,&rdquo; cried Peterkin, one morning about 
three weeks after our return from our long excursion, 
&ldquo;let&rsquo;s be jolly to-day, and do something 
vigorous.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m quite tired of hammering and hammering,
hewing and screwing, cutting and butting, at that little boat of 
ours, that seems as hard to build as Noah&rsquo;s ark; let us go 
on an excursion to the mountain top, or have a hunt after the 
wild ducks, or make a dash at the pigs.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m quite 
flat&mdash;flat as bad ginger-beer&mdash;flat as a pancake; in 
fact, I want something to rouse me, to toss me up, as it 
were.&nbsp; Eh! what do you say to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Jack, throwing down the axe with 
which he was just about to proceed towards the boat, &ldquo;if 
that&rsquo;s what you want, I would recommend you to make an 
excursion to the water-spouts; the last one we had to do with 
tossed you up a considerable height, perhaps the next will send 
you higher, who knows, if you&rsquo;re at all reasonable or 
moderate in your expectations!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, my dear boy,&rdquo; said Peterkin, gravely, 
&ldquo;you are really becoming too fond of jesting.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s a thing I don&rsquo;t at all approve of, and if you 
don&rsquo;t give it up, I fear that, for our mutual good, we 
shall have to part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, Peterkin,&rdquo; replied Jack, with a 
smile, &ldquo;what would you have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have?&rdquo; said Peterkin, &ldquo;I would <i>have</i> 
nothing.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t say I wanted to <i>have</i>; I said
that I wanted to <i>do</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the by,&rdquo; said I, interrupting their 
conversation, &ldquo;I am reminded by this that we have not yet 
discovered the nature of yon curious appearance that we saw near 
the water-spouts, on our journey round the island.&nbsp; Perhaps 
it would be well to go for that purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; ejaculated Peterkin, &ldquo;I know the 
nature of it well enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was of a <i>mysterious</i> nature to be sure!&rdquo;
said he, with a wave of his hand, while he rose from the log on 
which he had been sitting, and buckled on his belt, into which he
thrust his enormous club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, let us away to the water-spouts,&rdquo; 
cried Jack, going up to the bower for his bow and arrows; 
&ldquo;and bring your spear, Peterkin.&nbsp; It may be 
useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now, having made up our minds to examine into this matter, 
sallied forth eagerly in the direction of the water-spout rocks, 
which, as I have before mentioned, were not far from our present 
place of abode.&nbsp; On arriving there we hastened down to the 
edge of the rocks, and gazed over into the sea, where we observed
the pale-green object still distinctly visible, moving its tail 
slowly to and fro in the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most remarkable!&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exceedingly curious,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beats everything!&rdquo; said Peterkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Jack,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you made such a poor
figure in your last attempt to stick that object, that I would 
advise you to let me try it.&nbsp; If it has got a heart at all, 
I&rsquo;ll engage to send my spear right through the core of it; 
if it hasn&rsquo;t got a heart, I&rsquo;ll send it through the 
spot where its heart ought to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire away, then, my boy,&rdquo; replied Jack with a 
laugh.</p>
<p>Peterkin immediately took the spear, poised it for a second or
two above his head, then darted it like an arrow into the 
sea.&nbsp; Down it went straight into the centre of the green 
object, passed quite through it, and came up immediately 
afterwards, pure and unsullied, while the mysterious tail moved 
quietly as before!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Peterkin, gravely, &ldquo;that brute 
is a heartless monster; I&rsquo;ll have nothing more to do with 
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty sure now,&rdquo; said Jack, 
&ldquo;that it is merely a phosphoric light; but I must say 
I&rsquo;m puzzled at its staying always in that exact 
spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I also was much puzzled, and inclined to think with Jack that 
it must be phosphoric light; of which luminous appearance we had 
seen much while on our voyage to these seas.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there is nothing to hinder us 
from diving down to it, now that we are sure it is not a 
shark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; returned Jack, stripping off his clothes; 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go down, Ralph, as I&rsquo;m better at diving 
than you are.&nbsp; Now then, Peterkin, out o&rsquo; the 
road!&rdquo;&nbsp; Jack stepped forward, joined his hands above 
his head, bent over the rocks, and plunged into the sea.&nbsp; 
For a second or two the spray caused by his dive hid him from 
view, then the water became still, and we saw him swimming far 
down in the midst of the green object.&nbsp; Suddenly he sank 
below it, and vanished altogether from our sight!&nbsp; We gazed 
anxiously down at the spot where he had disappeared, for nearly a
minute, expecting every moment to see him rise again for breath; 
but fully a minute passed, and still he did not reappear.&nbsp; 
Two minutes passed! and then a flood of alarm rushed in upon my 
soul, when I considered that during all my acquaintance with him,
Jack had never stayed underwater more than a minute at a time; 
indeed seldom so long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Peterkin!&rdquo; I said, in a voice that trembled 
with increasing anxiety, &ldquo;something has happened.&nbsp; It 
is more than three minutes now!&rdquo;&nbsp; But Peterkin did not
answer and I observed that he was gazing down into the water with
a look of intense fear mingled with anxiety, while his face was 
overspread with a deadly paleness.&nbsp; Suddenly he sprang to 
his feet and rushed about in a frantic state, wringing his hands,
and exclaiming, &ldquo;Oh, Jack, Jack! he is gone!&nbsp; It must 
have been a shark, and he is gone for ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the next five minutes I know not what I did.&nbsp; The 
intensity of my feelings almost bereft me of my senses.&nbsp; But
I was recalled to myself by Peterkin seizing me by the shoulder 
and staring wildly into my face, while he exclaimed, 
&ldquo;Ralph! Ralph! perhaps he has only fainted.&nbsp; Dive for 
him, Ralph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed strange that this did not occur to me sooner.&nbsp; 
In a moment I rushed to the edge of the rocks, and, without 
waiting to throw off my garments, was on the point to spring into
the waves, when I observed something black rising up through the 
green object.&nbsp; In another moment Jack&rsquo;s head rose to 
the surface, and he gave a wild shout, flinging back the spray 
from his locks, as was his wont after a dive.&nbsp; Now we were 
almost as much amazed at seeing him reappear, well and strong, as
we had been at first at his non-appearance; for, to the best of 
our judgment, he had been nearly ten minutes under water, perhaps
longer, and it required no exertion of our reason to convince us 
that this was utterly impossible for mortal man to do and retain 
his strength and faculties.&nbsp; It was therefore with a feeling
akin to superstitious awe that I held down my hand and assisted 
him to clamber up the steep rocks.&nbsp; But no such feeling 
affected Peterkin.&nbsp; No sooner did Jack gain the rocks and 
seat himself on one, panting for breath, than he threw his arms 
round his neck, and burst into a flood of tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
Jack, Jack!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;where were you?&nbsp; What 
kept you so long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few moments Peterkin became composed enough to sit 
still and listen to Jack&rsquo;s explanation, although he could 
not restrain himself from attempting to wink every two minutes at
me, in order to express his joy at Jack&rsquo;s safety.&nbsp; I 
say he attempted to wink, but I am bound to add that he did not 
succeed, for his eyes were so much swollen with weeping, that his
frequent attempts only resulted in a series of violent and 
altogether idiotical contortions of the face, that were very far 
from expressing what he intended.&nbsp; However, I knew what the 
poor fellow meant by it, so I smiled to him in return, and 
endeavoured to make believe that he was winking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, lads,&rdquo; said Jack, when we were composed 
enough to listen to him, &ldquo;yon green object is not a shark; 
it is a stream of light issuing from a cave in the rocks.&nbsp; 
Just after I made my dive, I observed that this light came from 
the side of the rock above which we are now sitting; so I struck 
out for it, and saw an opening into some place or other that 
appeared to be luminous within.&nbsp; For one instant I paused to
think whether I ought to venture.&nbsp; Then I made up my mind, 
and dashed into it.&nbsp; For you see, Peterkin, although I take 
some time to tell this, it happened in the space of a few 
seconds, so that I knew I had wind enough in me to serve to bring
me out o&rsquo; the hole and up to the surface again.&nbsp; Well,
I was just on the point of turning,&mdash;for I began to feel a 
little uncomfortable in such a place,&mdash;when it seemed to me 
as if there was a faint light right above me.&nbsp; I darted 
upwards, and found my head out of water.&nbsp; This relieved me 
greatly, for I now felt that I could take in air enough to enable
me to return the way I came.&nbsp; Then it all at once occurred 
to me that I might not be able to find the way out again; but, on
glancing downwards, my mind was put quite at rest by seeing the 
green light below me streaming into the cave, just like the light
that we had seen streaming out of it, only what I now saw was 
much brighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first I could scarcely see anything as I gazed 
around me, it was so dark; but gradually my eyes became 
accustomed to it, and I found that I was in a huge cave, part of 
the walls of which I observed on each side of me.&nbsp; The 
ceiling just above me was also visible, and I fancied that I 
could perceive beautiful glittering objects there, but the 
farther end of the cave was shrouded in darkness.&nbsp; While I 
was looking around me in great wonder, it came into my head that 
you two would think I was drowned; so I plunged down through the 
passage again in a great hurry, rose to the surface, 
and&mdash;here I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Jack concluded his recital of what he had seen in this 
remarkable cave, I could not rest satisfied till I had dived down
to see it; which I did, but found it so dark, as Jack had said, 
that I could scarcely see anything.&nbsp; When I returned, we had
a long conversation about it, during which I observed that 
Peterkin had a most lugubrious expression on his countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Peterkin?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter?&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s 
all very well for you two to be talking away like mermaids about 
the wonders of this cave, but you know I must be content to hear 
about it, while you are enjoying yourselves down there like mad 
dolphins.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s really too bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry for you, Peterkin, indeed I 
am,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;but we cannot help you.&nbsp; If you
would only learn to dive&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Learn to fly, you might as well say!&rdquo; retorted 
Peterkin, in a very sulky tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you would only consent to keep still,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;we would take you down with us in ten seconds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; returned Peterkin; &ldquo;suppose a 
salamander was to propose to you &lsquo;only to keep 
still,&rsquo; and he would carry you through a blazing fire in a 
few seconds, what would you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We both laughed and shook our heads, for it was evident that 
nothing was to be made of Peterkin in the water.&nbsp; But we 
could not rest satisfied till we had seen more of this cave; so, 
after further consultation, Jack and I determined to try if we 
could take down a torch with us, and set fire to it in the 
cavern.&nbsp; This we found to be an undertaking of no small 
difficulty; but we accomplished it at last by the following 
means:&mdash;First, we made a torch of a very inflammable nature 
out of the bark of a certain tree, which we cut into strips, and,
after twisting, cemented together with a kind of resin or gum, 
which we also obtained from another tree; neither of which trees,
however, was known by name to Jack.&nbsp; This, when prepared, we
wrapped up in a great number of plies of cocoa-nut cloth, so that
we were confident it could not get wet during the short time it 
should be under water.&nbsp; Then we took a small piece of the 
tinder, which we had carefully treasured up lest we should 
require it, as before said, when the sun should fail us; also, we
rolled up some dry grass and a few chips, which, with a little 
bow and drill, like those described before, we made into another 
bundle, and wrapped it up in cocoa-nut cloth.&nbsp; When all was 
ready we laid aside our garments, with the exception of our 
trousers, which, as we did not know what rough scraping against 
the rocks we might be subjected to, we kept on.</p>
<p>Then we advanced to the edge of the rocks, Jack carrying one 
bundle, with the torch; I the other, with the things for 
producing fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t weary for us, Peterkin, should we be 
gone some time,&rdquo; said Jack; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll be sure to 
return in half-an-hour at the very latest, however interesting 
the cave should be, that we may relieve your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo; said Peterkin, coming up to us with a 
look of deep but pretended solemnity, while he shook hands and 
kissed each of us on the cheek.&nbsp; &ldquo;Farewell! and while 
you are gone I shall repose my weary limbs under the shelter of 
this bush, and meditate on the changefulness of all things 
earthly, with special reference to the forsaken condition of a 
poor ship-wrecked sailor boy!&rdquo;&nbsp; So saying, Peterkin 
waved his hand, turned from us, and cast himself upon the ground 
with a look of melancholy resignation, which was so well feigned,
that I would have thought it genuine had he not accompanied it 
with a gentle wink.&nbsp; We both laughed, and, springing from 
the rocks together, plunged head first into the sea.</p>
<p>We gained the interior of the submarine cave without 
difficulty, and, on emerging from the waves, supported ourselves 
for some time by treading-water, while we held the two bundles 
above our heads.&nbsp; This we did in order to let our eyes 
become accustomed to the obscurity.&nbsp; Then, when we could see
sufficiently, we swam to a shelving rock, and landed in 
safety.&nbsp; Having wrung the water from our trousers, and dried
ourselves as well as we could under the circumstances, we 
proceeded to ignite the torch.&nbsp; This we accomplished without
difficulty in a few minutes; and no sooner did it flare up than 
we were struck dumb with the wonderful objects that were revealed
to our gaze.&nbsp; The roof of the cavern just above us seemed to
be about ten feet high, but grew higher as it receded into the 
distance, until it was lost in darkness.&nbsp; It seemed to be 
made of coral, and was supported by massive columns of the same 
material.&nbsp; Immense icicles (as they appeared to us) hung 
from it in various places.&nbsp; These, however, were formed, not
of ice, but of a species of limestone, which seemed to flow in a 
liquid form towards the point of each, where it became 
solid.&nbsp; A good many drops fell, however, to the rock below, 
and these formed little cones, which rose to meet the points 
above.&nbsp; Some of them had already met, and thus we saw how 
the pillars were formed, which at first seemed to us as if they 
had been placed there by some human architect to support the 
roof.&nbsp; As we advanced farther in, we saw that the floor was 
composed of the same material as the pillars; and it presented 
the curious appearance of ripples, such as are formed on water 
when gently ruffled by the wind.&nbsp; There were several 
openings on either hand in the walls, that seemed to lead into 
other caverns; but these we did not explore at this time.&nbsp; 
We also observed that the ceiling was curiously marked in many 
places, as if it were the fret-work of a noble cathedral; and the
walls, as well as the roof, sparkled in the light of our torch, 
and threw back gleams and flashes, as if they were covered with 
precious stones.&nbsp; Although we proceeded far into this 
cavern, we did not come to the end of it; and we were obliged to 
return more speedily than we would otherwise have done, as our 
torch was nearly expended.&nbsp; We did not observe any openings 
in the roof, or any indications of places whereby light might 
enter; but near the entrance to the cavern stood an immense mass 
of pure white coral rock, which caught and threw back the little 
light that found an entrance through the cave&rsquo;s mouth, and 
thus produced, we conjectured, the pale-green object which had 
first attracted our attention.&nbsp; We concluded, also, that the
reflecting power of this rock was that which gave forth the dim 
light that faintly illumined the first part of the cave.</p>
<p>Before diving through the passage again we extinguished the 
small piece of our torch that remained, and left it in a dry 
spot; conceiving that we might possibly stand in need of it, if 
at any future time we should chance to wet our torch while diving
into the cavern.&nbsp; As we stood for a few minutes after it was
out, waiting till our eyes became accustomed to the gloom, we 
could not help remarking the deep, intense stillness and the 
unutterable gloom of all around us; and, as I thought of the 
stupendous dome above, and the countless gems that had sparkled 
in the torch-light a few minutes before, it came into my mind to 
consider how strange it is that God should make such wonderful 
and extremely-beautiful works never to be seen at all, except, 
indeed, by chance visitors such as ourselves.</p>
<p>I afterwards found that there were many such caverns among the
islands of the South Seas, some of them larger and more beautiful
than the one I have just described.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Ralph, are you ready?&rdquo; said Jack, in a low 
voice, that seemed to echo up into the dome above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, then,&rdquo; said he; and, plunging off the
ledge of the rock into the water, we dived through the narrow 
entrance.&nbsp; In a few seconds we were panting on the rocks 
above, and receiving the congratulations of our friend 
Peterkin.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<p>Strange peculiarity of the tides&mdash;Also of the 
twilight&mdash;Peterkin&rsquo;s remarkable conduct in embracing a
little pig and killing a big sow&mdash;Sage remarks on 
jesting&mdash;Also on love.</p>
<p>It was quite a relief to us to breathe the pure air and to 
enjoy the glad sunshine after our long ramble in the Diamond 
Cave, as we named it; for, although we did not stay more than 
half an hour away, it seemed to us much longer.&nbsp; While we 
were dressing, and during our walk home, we did our best to 
satisfy the curiosity of poor Peterkin, who seemed to regret, 
with lively sincerity, his inability to dive.</p>
<p>There was no help for it, however, so we condoled with him as 
we best could.&nbsp; Had there been any great rise or fall in the
tide of these seas, we might perhaps have found it possible to 
take him down with us at low water; but as the tide never rose or
fell more than eighteen inches or two feet, this was 
impossible.</p>
<p>This peculiarity of the tide&mdash;its slight rise and 
fall&mdash;had not attracted our observation till some time after
our residence on the island.&nbsp; Neither had we observed 
another curious circumstance until we had been some time 
there.&nbsp; This was the fact, that the tide rose and fell with 
constant regularity, instead of being affected by the changes of 
the moon as in our own country, and as it is in most other parts 
of the world,&mdash;at least in all those parts with which I am 
acquainted.&nbsp; Every day and every night, at twelve 
o&rsquo;clock precisely, the tide is at the full; and at six 
o&rsquo;clock every morning and evening it is ebb.&nbsp; I can 
speak with much confidence on this singular circumstance, as we 
took particular note of it, and never found it to alter.&nbsp; Of
course, I must admit, we had to guess the hour of twelve 
midnight, and I think we could do this pretty correctly; but in 
regard to twelve noon we are quite positive, because we easily 
found the highest point that the sun reached in the sky by 
placing ourselves at a certain spot whence we observed the sharp 
summit of a cliff resting against the sky, just where the sun 
passed.</p>
<p>Jack and I were surprised that we had not noticed this the 
first few days of our residence here, and could only account for 
it by our being so much taken up with the more obvious wonders of
our novel situation.&nbsp; I have since learned, however, that 
this want of observation is a sad and very common infirmity of 
human nature, there being hundreds of persons before whose eyes 
the most wonderful things are passing every day, who nevertheless
are totally ignorant of them.&nbsp; I therefore have to record my
sympathy with such persons, and to recommend to them a course of 
conduct which I have now for a long time myself 
adopted,&mdash;namely, the habit of forcing my attention upon 
<i>all</i> things that go on around me, and of taking some degree
of interest in them, whether I feel it naturally or not.&nbsp; I 
suggest this the more earnestly, though humbly, because I have 
very frequently come to know that my indifference to a thing has 
generally been caused by my ignorance in regard to it.</p>
<p>We had much serious conversation on this subject of the tides;
and Jack told us, in his own quiet, philosophical way, that these
tides did great good to the world in many ways, particularly in 
the way of cleansing the shores of the land, and carrying off the
filth that was constantly poured into the sea there-from; which, 
Peterkin suggested, was remarkably <i>tidy</i> of it to do.&nbsp;
Poor Peterkin could never let slip an opportunity to joke, 
however inopportune it might be: which at first we found rather a
disagreeable propensity, as it often interrupted the flow of very
agreeable conversation; and, indeed, I cannot too strongly record
my disapprobation of this tendency in general: but we became so 
used to it at last that we found it no interruption whatever; 
indeed, strange to say, we came to feel that it was a necessary 
part of our enjoyment (such is the force of habit), and found the
sudden outbursts of mirth, resulting from his humorous 
disposition, quite natural and refreshing to us in the midst of 
our more serious conversations.&nbsp; But I must not misrepresent
Peterkin.&nbsp; We often found, to our surprise, that he knew 
many things which we did not; and I also observed that those 
things which he learned from experience were never 
forgotten.&nbsp; From all these things I came at length to 
understand that things very opposite and dissimilar in 
themselves, when united, do make an agreeable whole; as, for 
example, we three on this our island, although most unlike in 
many things, when united, made a trio so harmonious that I 
question if there ever met before such an agreeable 
triumvirate.&nbsp; There was, indeed, no note of discord whatever
in the symphony we played together on that sweet Coral Island; 
and I am now persuaded that this was owing to our having been all
tuned to the same key, namely, that of <i>love</i>!&nbsp; Yes, we
loved one another with much fervency while we lived on that 
island; and, for the matter of that, we love each other 
still.</p>
<p>And while I am on this subject, or rather the subject that 
just preceded it&mdash;namely, the tides&mdash;I may here remark 
on another curious natural phenomenon.&nbsp; We found that there 
was little or no twilight in this island.&nbsp; We had a distinct
remembrance of the charming long twilight at home, which some 
people think the most delightful part of the day, though for my 
part I have always preferred sunrise; and when we first landed, 
we used to sit down on some rocky point or eminence, at the close
of our day&rsquo;s work, to enjoy the evening breeze; but no 
sooner had the sun sunk below the horizon than all became 
suddenly dark.&nbsp; This rendered it necessary that we should 
watch the sun when we happened to be out hunting, for to be 
suddenly left in the dark while in the woods was very perplexing,
as, although the stars shone with great beauty and brilliancy, 
they could not pierce through the thick umbrageous boughs that 
interlaced above our heads.</p>
<p>But, to return: After having told all we could to Peterkin 
about the Diamond Cave under Spouting Cliff, as we named the 
locality, we were wending our way rapidly homewards, when a grunt
and a squeal were borne down by the land breeze to our ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the ticket!&rdquo; was Peterkin&rsquo;s 
remarkable exclamation, as he started convulsively, and levelled 
his spear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; cried Jack; &ldquo;these are your friends,
Peterkin.&nbsp; They must have come over expressly to pay you a 
friendly visit, for it is the first time we have seen them on 
this side the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along!&rdquo; cried Peterkin, hurrying towards the
wood, while Jack and I followed, smiling at his impatience.</p>
<p>Another grunt and half a dozen squeals, much louder than 
before, came down the valley.&nbsp; At this time we were just 
opposite the small vale which lay between the Valley of the Wreck
and Spouting Cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Peterkin,&rdquo; cried Jack, in a hoarse 
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay a bit, man.&nbsp; These grunters are just up there
on the hill side.&nbsp; If you go and stand with Ralph in the lee
of yon cliff, I&rsquo;ll cut round behind and drive them through 
the gorge, so that you&rsquo;ll have a better chance of picking 
out a good one.&nbsp; Now, mind you pitch into a fat young pig, 
Peterkin,&rdquo; added Jack, as he sprang into the bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t I, just!&rdquo; said Peterkin, licking his 
lips, as we took our station beside the cliff.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
feel quite a tender affection for young pigs in my heart.&nbsp; 
Perhaps it would be more correct to say in my 
s&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they come!&rdquo; cried I, as a terrific yell 
from Jack sent the whole herd screaming down the hill.&nbsp; Now,
Peterkin, being unable to hold back, crept a short way up a very 
steep grassy mound, in order to get a better view of the hogs 
before they came up; and just as he raised his head above its 
summit, two little pigs, which had outrun their companions, 
rushed over the top with the utmost precipitation.&nbsp; One of 
these brushed close past Peterkin&rsquo;s ear; the other, unable 
to arrest its headlong flight, went, as Peterkin himself 
afterwards expressed it, &ldquo;bash&rdquo; into his arms with a 
sudden squeal, which was caused more by the force of the blow 
than the will of the animal, and both of them rolled violently 
down to the foot of the mound.&nbsp; No sooner was this reached 
than the little pig recovered its feet, tossed up its tail, and 
fled shrieking from the spot.&nbsp; But I slang a large stone 
after it, which, being fortunately well aimed, hit it behind the 
ear, and felled it to the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capital, Ralph! that&rsquo;s your sort!&rdquo; cried 
Peterkin, who, to my surprise and great relief, had risen to his 
feet.&nbsp; Apparently unhurt, though much dishevelled, he rushed
franticly towards the gorge, which the yells of the hogs told us 
they were now approaching.&nbsp; I had made up my mind that I 
would abstain from killing another, as, if Peterkin should be 
successful, two were more than sufficient for our wants at the 
present time.&nbsp; Suddenly they all burst forth,&mdash;two or 
three little round ones in advance, and an enormous old sow with 
a drove of hogs at her heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Peterkin,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a 
nice little fat one; just spear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Peterkin did not move; he allowed it to pass 
unharmed.&nbsp; I looked at him in surprise, and saw that his 
lips were compressed and his eyebrows knitted, as if he were 
about to fight with some awful enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I inquired, with some 
trepidation.</p>
<p>Suddenly he levelled his spear, darted forward, and, with a 
yell that nearly froze the blood in my veins, stabbed the old sow
to the heart.&nbsp; Nay, so vigorously was it done that the spear
went in at one side and came out at the other!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Peterkin!&rdquo; said I, going up to him, 
&ldquo;what have you done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve killed their 
great-great-grandmother, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said he, 
looking with a somewhat awe-struck expression at the transfixed 
animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo! what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; said Jack, as he came 
up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, Peterkin, you must be fond of a tough 
chop.&nbsp; If you mean to eat this old hog, she&rsquo;ll try 
your jaws, I warrant.&nbsp; What possessed you to stick 
<i>her</i>, Peterkin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the fact is I want a pair of shoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have your shoes to do with the old hog?&rsquo; 
said I, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My present shoes have certainly nothing to do with 
her,&rdquo; replied Peterkin; &ldquo;nevertheless she will have a
good deal to do with my future shoes.&nbsp; The fact is, when I 
saw you floor that pig so neatly, Ralph, it struck me that there 
was little use in killing another.&nbsp; Then I remembered all at
once that I had long wanted some leather or tough substance to 
make shoes of, and this old grandmother seemed so tough that I 
just made up my mind to stick her, and you see I&rsquo;ve done 
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you certainly have, Peterkin,&rdquo; said Jack, as
he was examining the transfixed animal.</p>
<p>We now considered how we were to carry our game home, for, 
although the distance was short, the hog was very heavy.&nbsp; At
length we hit on the plan of tying its four feet together, and 
passing the spear handle between them.&nbsp; Jack took one end on
his shoulder, I took the other on mine, and Peterkin carried the 
small pig.</p>
<p>Thus we returned in triumph to our bower, laden, as Peterkin 
remarked, with the glorious spoils of a noble hunt.&nbsp; As he 
afterwards spoke in similarly glowing terms in reference to the 
supper that followed, there is every reason to believe that we 
retired that night to our leafy beds in a high state of 
satisfaction.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<p>Boat-building extraordinary&mdash;Peterkin tries his hand at 
cookery and fails most signally&mdash;The boat 
finished&mdash;Curious conversation with the cat, and other 
matters.</p>
<p>For many days after this Jack applied himself with unremitting
assiduity to the construction of our boat, which at length began 
to look somewhat like one.&nbsp; But those only who have had the 
thing to do can entertain a right idea of the difficulty involved
in such an undertaking, with no other implements than an axe, a 
bit of hoop-iron, a sail-needle, and a broken pen-knife.&nbsp; 
But Jack did it.&nbsp; He was of, that disposition which 
<i>will</i> not be conquered.&nbsp; When he believed himself to 
be acting rightly, he overcame all obstacles.&nbsp; I have seen 
Jack, when doubtful whether what he was about to do were right or
wrong, as timid and vacillating as a little girl,&mdash;and I 
honour him for it!</p>
<p>As this boat was a curiosity in its way, a few words here 
relative to the manner of its construction may not be amiss.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned the chestnut tree with its wonderful 
buttresses or planks.&nbsp; This tree, then, furnished us with 
the chief part of our material.&nbsp; First of all Jack sought 
out a limb of a tree of such a form and size as, while it should 
form the keel a bend at either end should form the stem and stern
posts.&nbsp; Such a piece, however, was not easy to obtain, but 
at last he procured it, by rooting up a small tree which had a 
branch growing at the proper angle about ten feet up its stem, 
with two strong roots growing in such a form as enabled him to 
make a flat-sterned boat.&nbsp; This placed, he procured three 
branching roots of suitable size, which he fitted to the keel at 
equal distances, thus forming three strong ribs.&nbsp; Now, the 
squaring and shaping of these, and the cutting of the grooves in 
the keel, was an easy enough matter, as it was all work for the 
axe, in the use of which Jack was become wonderfully expert; but 
it was quite a different affair when he came to nailing the ribs 
to the keel, for we had no instrument capable of boring a large 
hole, and no nails to fasten them with.&nbsp; We were, indeed, 
much perplexed here; but Jack at length devised an instrument 
that served very well.&nbsp; He took the remainder of our 
hoop-iron and beat it into the form of a pipe or cylinder, about 
as thick as a man&rsquo;s finger.&nbsp; This he did by means of 
our axe and the old rusty axe we had found at the house of the 
poor man at the other side of the island.&nbsp; This, when made 
red hot, bored slowly though the timbers; and, the better to 
retain the heat, Jack shut up one end of it and filled it with 
sand.&nbsp; True, the work was very slowly done, but it mattered 
not&mdash;we had little else to do.&nbsp; Two holes were bored in
each timber, about an inch and a half apart, and also down into 
the keel, but not quite through.&nbsp; Into these were placed 
stout pegs made of a tree called iron-wood; and, when they were 
hammered well home, the timbers were as firmly fixed as if they 
had been nailed with iron.&nbsp; The gunwales, which were very 
stout, were fixed in a similar manner.&nbsp; But, besides the 
wooden nails, they were firmly lashed to the stem and stern posts
and ribs by means of a species of cordage which we had contrived 
to make out of the fibrous husk of the cocoa nut.&nbsp; This husk
was very tough, and when a number of the threads were joined 
together they formed excellent cordage.&nbsp; At first we tied 
the different lengths together, but this was such a clumsy and 
awkward complication of knots, that we contrived, by careful 
interlacing of the ends together before twisting, to make good 
cordage of any size or length we chose.&nbsp; Of course it cost 
us much time and infinite labour, but Jack kept up our spirits 
when we grew weary, and so all that we required was at last 
constructed.</p>
<p>Planks were now cut off the chestnut trees of about an inch 
thick.&nbsp; These were dressed with the axe,&mdash;but clumsily,
for an axe is ill adapted for such work.&nbsp; Five of these 
planks on each side were sufficient, and we formed the boat in a 
very rounded, barrel-like shape, in order to have as little 
twisting of the planks as possible; for, although we could easily
bend them, we could not easily twist them.&nbsp; Having no nails 
to rivet the planks with, we threw aside the ordinary fashion of 
boat building and adopted one of our own.&nbsp; The planks were 
therefore placed on each other&rsquo;s edges, and sewed together 
with the tough cordage already mentioned.&nbsp; They were also 
thus sewed to the stem, the stern, and the keel.&nbsp; Each 
stitch or tie was six inches apart, and was formed thus: Three 
holes were bored in the upper plank and three in the 
lower,&mdash;the holes being above each other, that is, in a 
vertical line.&nbsp; Through these holes the cord was passed, 
and, when tied, formed a powerful stitch of three ply.&nbsp; 
Besides this, we placed between the edges of the planks, layers 
of cocoa-nut fibre, which, as it swelled when wetted, would, we 
hoped, make our little vessel water-tight.&nbsp; But in order 
further to secure this end, we collected a large quantity of 
pitch from the bread-fruit tree, with which, when boiled in our 
old iron pot, we payed the whole of the inside of the boat, and, 
while it was yet hot, placed large pieces of cocoa-nut cloth on 
it, and then gave it another coat above that.&nbsp; Thus the 
interior was covered with a tough water-tight material; while the
exterior, being uncovered, and so exposed to the swelling action 
of the water, was we hoped, likely to keep the boat quite 
dry.&nbsp; I may add that our hopes were not disappointed.</p>
<p>While Jack was thus engaged, Peterkin and I sometimes assisted
him, but, as our assistance was not much required, we more 
frequently went a-hunting on the extensive mud-flats at the 
entrance of the long valley which lay nearest to our bower.&nbsp;
Here we found large flocks of ducks of various kinds, some of 
them bearing so much resemblance to the wild ducks of our own 
country that I think they must have been the same.&nbsp; On these
occasions we took the bow and the sling, with both of which we 
were often successful, though I must confess I was the least 
so.&nbsp; Our suppers were thus pleasantly varied, and sometimes 
we had such a profusion spread out before us that we frequently 
knew not with which of the dainties to begin.</p>
<p>I must also add, that the poor old cat which we had brought 
home had always a liberal share of our good things, and so well 
was it looked after, especially by Peterkin, that it recovered 
much of its former strength, and seemed to improve in sight as 
well as hearing.</p>

<img alt="Leaving for the &ldquo;mud-flats&rdquo;"

</a></p>
<p>The large flat stone, or rock of coral, which stood just in 
front of the entrance to our bower, was our table.&nbsp; On this 
rock we had spread out the few articles we possessed the day we 
were shipwrecked; and on the same rock, during many a day 
afterwards, we spread out the bountiful supply with which we had 
been blessed on our Coral Island.&nbsp; Sometimes we sat down at 
this table to a feast consisting of hot rolls,&mdash;as Peterkin 
called the newly baked bread fruit,&mdash;a roast pig, roast 
duck, boiled and roasted yams, cocoa nuts, taro, and sweet 
potatoes; which we followed up with a dessert of plums, apples, 
and plantains,&mdash;the last being a large-sized and delightful 
fruit, which grew on a large shrub or tree not more than twelve 
feet high, with light-green leaves of enormous length and 
breadth.&nbsp; These luxurious feasts were usually washed down 
with cocoa-nut lemonade.</p>
<p>Occasionally Peterkin tried to devise some new 
dish,&mdash;&ldquo;a conglomerate,&rdquo; as he used to say; but 
these generally turned out such atrocious compounds that he was 
ultimately induced to give up his attempts in extreme 
disgust.&nbsp; Not forgetting, however, to point out to Jack that
his failure was a direct contradiction to the proverb which he, 
Jack, was constantly thrusting down his throat, namely, that 
&ldquo;where there&rsquo;s a will there&rsquo;s a 
way.&rdquo;&nbsp; For he had a great will to become a cook, but 
could by no means find a way to accomplish that end.</p>
<p>One day, while Peterkin and I were seated beside our table on 
which dinner was spread, Jack came up from the beach, and, 
flinging down his axe, exclaimed,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, lads, the boat&rsquo;s finished at last! so 
we&rsquo;ve nothing to do now but shape two pair of oars, and 
then we may put to sea as soon as we like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This piece of news threw us into a state of great joy; for 
although we were aware that the boat had been gradually getting 
near its completion, it had taken so long that we did not expect 
it to be quite ready for at least two or three weeks.&nbsp; But 
Jack had wrought hard and said nothing, in order to surprise 
us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; cried Peterkin, 
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re a perfect trump.&nbsp; But why did you not 
tell us it was so nearly ready? won&rsquo;t we have a jolly sail 
to-morrow? eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so much, Peterkin,&rdquo; said Jack; 
&ldquo;and, pray, hand me a bit of that pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, my dear,&rdquo; cried Peterkin, seizing the 
axe; &ldquo;what part will you have? a leg, or a wing, or a piece
of the breast; which?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hind leg, if you please,&rdquo; answered Jack; 
&ldquo;and, pray, be so good as to include the tail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said Peterkin, exchanging the
axe for his hoop-iron knife, with which he cut off the desired 
portion.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only too glad, my dear boy, to 
see that your appetite is so wholesale; and there&rsquo;s no 
chance whatever of its dwindling down into re-tail again, at 
least in so far as this pig is concerned.&nbsp; Ralph, lad, why 
don&rsquo;t you laugh?&mdash;eh?&rdquo; he added turning suddenly
to me with a severe look of inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laugh?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;what at, Peterkin? why 
should I laugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Jack and Peterkin answered this inquiry by themselves 
laughing so immoderately that I was induced to believe I had 
missed noticing some good joke, so I begged that it might be 
explained to me; but as this only produced repeated roars of 
laughter, I smiled and helped myself to another slice of 
plantain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but,&rdquo; continued Peterkin, &ldquo;I was 
talking of a sail to-morrow.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t we have one, 
Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Jack, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t have a 
sail, but I hope we shall have a row, as I intend to work hard at
the oars this afternoon, and, if we can&rsquo;t get them finished
by sunset we&rsquo;ll light our candle-nuts, and turn them out of
hands before we turn into bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Peterkin, tossing a lump of pork
to the cat, who received it with a mew of satisfaction.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you, if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afterwards,&rdquo; continued Jack, &ldquo;we will make 
a sail out of the cocoa-nut cloth, and rig up a mast, and then we
shall be able to sail to some of the other islands, and visit our
old friends the penguins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prospect of being so soon in a position to extend our 
observations to the other islands, and enjoy a sail over the 
beautiful sea, afforded us much delight, and, after dinner, we 
set about making the oars in good earnest.&nbsp; Jack went into 
the woods and blocked them roughly out with the axe, and I 
smoothed them down with the knife, while Peterkin remained in the
bower, spinning, or, rather, twisting some strong thick cordage 
with which to fasten them to the boat.</p>
<p>We worked hard and rapidly, so that, when the sun went down, 
Jack and I returned to the bower with four stout oars, which 
required little to be done to them save a slight degree of 
polishing with the knife.&nbsp; As we drew near we were suddenly 
arrested by the sound of a voice!&nbsp; We were not a little 
surprised at this&mdash;indeed I may almost say 
alarmed&mdash;for, although Peterkin was undoubtedly fond of 
talking, we had never, up to this time, found him talking to 
himself.&nbsp; We listened intently, and still heard the sound of
a voice as if in conversation.&nbsp; Jack motioned me to be 
silent, and, advancing to the bower on tip-toe, we peeped in.</p>
<p>The sight that met our gaze was certainly not a little 
amusing.&nbsp; On the top of a log which we sometimes used as a 
table, sat the black cat, with a very demure expression on its 
countenance; and in front of it, sitting on the ground, with his 
legs extended on either side of the log, was Peterkin.&nbsp; At 
the moment we saw him he was gazing intently into the cat&rsquo;s
face, with his nose about four inches from it,&mdash;his hands 
being thrust into his breeches pockets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cat,&rdquo; said Peterkin, turning his head a little on
one side, &ldquo;I love you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause, as if Peterkin awaited a reply to this 
affectionate declaration but the cat said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear me?&rdquo; cried Peterkin, sharply.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I love you&mdash;I do.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you love 
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this touching appeal the cat said &ldquo;Mew,&rdquo; 
faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re a jolly old 
rascal.&nbsp; Why did you not speak at once? eh?&rdquo; and 
Peterkin put forward his mouth and kissed the cat on the 
nose!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Peterkin, after a pause, &ldquo;I
love you.&nbsp; D&rsquo;you think I&rsquo;d say so if I 
didn&rsquo;t, you black villain?&nbsp; I love you because 
I&rsquo;ve got to take care of you, and to look after you, and to
think about you, and to see that you don&rsquo;t 
die&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mew, me-a-w!&rdquo; said the cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; continued Peterkin, &ldquo;quite 
true, I have no doubt; but you&rsquo;ve no right to interrupt me,
sir.&nbsp; Hold your tongue till I have done speaking.&nbsp; 
Moreover, cat, I love you because you came to me the first time 
you ever saw me, and didn&rsquo;t seem to be afraid, and appeared
to be fond of me, though you didn&rsquo;t know that I 
wasn&rsquo;t going to kill you.&nbsp; Now, that was brave, that 
was bold, and very jolly, old boy, and I love you for it&mdash;I 
do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again there was a pause of a few minutes, during which the cat
looked placid, and Peterkin dropped his eyes upon its toes as if 
in contemplation.&nbsp; Suddenly he looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, cat, what are you thinking about now? won&rsquo;t
speak? eh?&nbsp; Now, tell me; don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s a
monstrous shame that these two scoundrels, Jack and Ralph, should
keep us waiting for our supper so long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the cat arose, put up its back and stretched itself; 
yawned slightly, and licked the point of Peterkin&rsquo;s 
nose!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so, old boy, you&rsquo;re a clever fellow,&mdash;I
really do believe the brute understands me!&rdquo; said Peterkin,
while a broad grin overspread his face, as he drew back and 
surveyed the cat.</p>
<p>At this point Jack burst into a loud fit of laughter.&nbsp; 
The cat uttered an angry fuff and fled, while Peterkin sprang up 
and exclaimed,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad luck to you, Jack! you&rsquo;ve nearly made the 
heart jump out of my body, you have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I have,&rdquo; replied Jack, laughing, as we 
entered the bower, &ldquo;but, as I don&rsquo;t intend to keep 
you or the cat any longer from your supper, I hope that 
you&rsquo;ll both forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peterkin endeavoured to turn this affair off with a laugh, but
I observed that he blushed very deeply at the time we discovered 
ourselves, and he did not seem to relish any allusion to the 
subject afterwards; so we refrained from remarking on it ever 
after,&mdash;though it tickled us not a little at the time.</p>
<p>After supper we retired to rest and to dream of wonderful 
adventures in our little boat, and distant voyages upon the 
sea.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<p>The boat launched&mdash;We visit the coral reef&mdash;The 
great breaker that never goes down&mdash;Coral insects&mdash;The 
way in which coral islands are made&mdash;The boat&rsquo;s 
sail&mdash;We tax our ingenuity to form fish-hooks&mdash;Some of 
the fish we saw&mdash;And a monstrous whale&mdash;Wonderful 
shower of little fish&mdash;Water-spouts.</p>
<p>It was a bright, clear, beautiful morning, when we first 
launched our little boat and rowed out upon the placid waters of 
the lagoon.&nbsp; Not a breath of wind ruffled the surface of the
deep.&nbsp; Not a cloud spotted the deep blue sky.&nbsp; Not a 
sound that was discordant broke the stillness of the morning, 
although there were many sounds, sweet, tiny, and melodious, that
mingled in the universal harmony of nature.&nbsp; The sun was 
just rising from the Pacific&rsquo;s ample bosom and tipping the 
mountain tops with a red glow.&nbsp; The sea was shining like a 
sheet of glass, yet heaving with the long deep swell that, all 
the world round, indicates the life of ocean; and the bright 
sea-weeds and the brilliant corals shone in the depths of that 
pellucid water, as we rowed over it, like rare and precious 
gems.&nbsp; Oh! it was a sight fitted to stir the soul of man to 
its profoundest depths, and, if he owned a heart at all, to lift 
that heart in adoration and gratitude to the great Creator of 
this magnificent and glorious universe.</p>
<p>At first, in the strength of our delight, we rowed hither and 
thither without aim or object.&nbsp; But after the effervescence 
of our spirits was abated, we began to look about us and to 
consider what we should do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I vote that we row to the reef,&rdquo; cried 
Peterkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I vote that we visit the islands within the 
lagoon,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I vote we do both,&rdquo; cried Jack, &ldquo;so 
pull away, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I have already said, we had made four oars, but our boat 
was so small that only two were necessary.&nbsp; The extra pair 
were reserved in case any accident should happen to the 
others.&nbsp; It was therefore only needful that two of us should
row, while the third steered, by means of an oar, and relieved 
the rowers occasionally.</p>
<p>First we landed on one of the small islands and ran all over 
it, but saw nothing worthy of particular notice.&nbsp; Then we 
landed on a larger island, on which were growing a few cocoa-nut 
trees.&nbsp; Not having eaten anything that morning, we gathered 
a few of the nuts and breakfasted.&nbsp; After this we pulled 
straight out to sea and landed on the coral reef.</p>
<p>This was indeed a novel and interesting sight to us.&nbsp; We 
had now been so long on shore that we had almost forgotten the 
appearance of breakers, for there were none within the lagoon; 
but now, as we stood beside the foam-crested billow of the open 
sea, all the enthusiasm of the sailor was awakened in our 
breasts; and, as we gazed on the wide-spread ruin of that single 
magnificent breaker that burst in thunder at our feet, we forgot 
the Coral Island behind us; we forgot our bower and the calm 
repose of the scented woods; we forgot all that had passed during
the last few months, and remembered nothing but the storms, the 
calms, the fresh breezes and the surging billows of the open 
sea.</p>
<p>This huge, ceaseless breaker, to which I have so often 
alluded, was a much larger and more sublime object than we had at
all imagined it to be.&nbsp; It rose many yards above the level 
of the sea, and could be seen approaching at some distance from 
the reef.&nbsp; Slowly and majestically it came on, acquiring 
greater volume and velocity as it advanced, until it assumed the 
form of a clear watery arch, which sparkled in the bright 
sun.&nbsp; On it came with resistless and solemn 
majesty,&mdash;the upper edge lipped gently over, and it fell 
with a roar that seemed as though the heart of Ocean were broken 
in the crash of tumultuous water, while the foam-clad coral reef 
appeared to tremble beneath the mighty shock!</p>
<p>We gazed long and wonderingly at this great sight, and it was 
with difficulty we could tear ourselves away from it.&nbsp; As I 
have once before mentioned, this wave broke in many places over 
the reef and scattered some of its spray into the lagoon, but in 
most places the reef was sufficiently broad and elevated to 
receive and check its entire force.&nbsp; In many places the 
coral rocks were covered with vegetation,&mdash;the beginning, as
it appeared to us, of future islands.&nbsp; Thus, on this reef, 
we came to perceive how most of the small islands of those seas 
are formed.&nbsp; On one part we saw the spray of the breaker 
washing over the rocks, and millions of little, active, busy 
creatures continuing the work of building up this living 
rampart.&nbsp; At another place, which was just a little too high
for the waves to wash over it, the coral insects were all dead; 
for we found that they never did their work above water.&nbsp; 
They had faithfully completed the mighty work which their Creator
had given them to do, and they were now all dead.&nbsp; Again, in
other spots the ceaseless lashing of the sea had broken the dead 
coral in pieces, and cast it up in the form of sand.&nbsp; Here 
sea-birds had alighted, little pieces of sea-weed and stray bits 
of wood had been washed up, seeds of plants had been carried by 
the wind and a few lovely blades of bright green had already 
sprung up, which, when they died, would increase the size and 
fertility of these emeralds of Ocean.&nbsp; At other places these
islets had grown apace, and were shaded by one or two cocoa-nut 
trees, which grew, literally, in the sand, and were constantly 
washed by the ocean spray; yet, as I have before remarked, their 
fruit was most refreshing and sweet to our taste.</p>
<p>Again at this time Jack and I pondered the formation of the 
large coral islands.&nbsp; We could now understand how the low 
ones were formed, but the larger islands cost us much 
consideration, yet we could arrive at no certain conclusion on 
the subject.</p>
<p>Having satisfied our curiosity and enjoyed ourselves during 
the whole day, in our little boat, we returned, somewhat wearied,
and, withal, rather hungry, to our bower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;as our boat answers so 
well, we will get a mast and sail made immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we will,&rdquo; cried Peterkin, as we all assisted 
to drag the boat above high-water mark; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll light 
our candle and set about it this very night.&nbsp; Hurrah, my 
boys, pull away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we dragged our boat, we observed that she grated heavily on
her keel; and, as the sands were in this place mingled with 
broken coral rocks, we saw portions of the wood being scraped 
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; cried Jack, on seeing this.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; Our keel will be worn off in no
time at this rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it will,&rdquo; said I, pondering deeply as to how 
this might be prevented.&nbsp; But I am not of a mechanical turn,
naturally, so I could conceive no remedy save that of putting a 
plate of iron on the keel, but as we had no iron I knew not what 
was to be done.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems to me, Jack,&rdquo; I 
added, &ldquo;that it is impossible to prevent the keel being 
worn off thus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; cried Peterkin, &ldquo;my dear 
Ralph, you are mistaken, there is nothing so 
easy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; I inquired, in some surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, by not using the boat at all!&rdquo; replied 
Peterkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your impudent tongue, Peterkin,&rdquo; said Jack, 
as he shouldered the oars, &ldquo;come along with me and 
I&rsquo;ll give you work to do.&nbsp; In the first place, you 
will go and collect cocoa-nut fibre, and set to work to make 
sewing twine with it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, captain,&rdquo; interrupted Peterkin, 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got lots of it made already,&mdash;more than 
enough, as a little friend of mine used to be in the habit of 
saying every day after dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; continued Jack; &ldquo;then 
you&rsquo;ll help Ralph to collect cocoa-nut cloth, and cut it 
into shape, after which we&rsquo;ll make a sail of it.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;ll see to getting the mast and the gearing; so 
let&rsquo;s to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to work we went right busily, so that in three days from 
that time we had set up a mast and sail, with the necessary 
rigging, in our little boat.&nbsp; The sail was not, indeed, very
handsome to look at, as it was formed of a number of oblong 
patches of cloth; but we had sewed it well by means of our 
sail-needle, so that it was strong, which was the chief 
point.&nbsp; Jack had also overcome the difficulty about the 
keel, by pinning to it a <i>false</i> keel.&nbsp; This was a 
piece of tough wood, of the same length and width as the real 
keel, and about five inches deep.&nbsp; He made it of this depth 
because the boat would be thereby rendered not only much more 
safe, but more able to beat against the wind; which, in a sea 
where the trade-winds blow so long and so steadily in one 
direction, was a matter of great importance.&nbsp; This piece of 
wood was pegged very firmly to the keel; and we now launched our 
boat with the satisfaction of knowing that when the false keel 
should be scraped off we could easily put on another; whereas, 
should the real keel have been scraped away, we could not have 
renewed it without taking our boat to pieces, which Peterkin said
made his &ldquo;marrow quake to think upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mast and sail answered excellently; and we now sailed 
about in the lagoon with great delight, and examined with much 
interest the appearance of our island from a distance.&nbsp; 
Also, we gazed into the depths of the water, and watched for 
hours the gambols of the curious and bright-coloured fish among 
the corals and sea-weed.&nbsp; Peterkin also made a fishing line,
and Jack constructed a number of hooks, some of which were very 
good, others remarkably bad.&nbsp; Some of these hooks were made 
of iron-wood, which did pretty well, the wood being extremely 
hard, and Jack made them very thick and large.&nbsp; Fish there 
are not particular.&nbsp; Some of the crooked bones in fish-heads
also answered for this purpose pretty well.&nbsp; But that which 
formed our best and most serviceable hook was the brass 
finger-ring belonging to Jack.&nbsp; It gave him not a little 
trouble to manufacture it.&nbsp; First he cut it with the axe; 
then twisted it into the form of a hook.&nbsp; The barb took him 
several hours to cut.&nbsp; He did it by means of constant sawing
with the broken pen-knife.&nbsp; As for the point, an 
hour&rsquo;s rubbing on a piece of sandstone made an excellent 
one.</p>
<p>It would be a matter of much time and labour to describe the 
appearance of the multitudes of fish that were day after day 
drawn into our boat by means of the brass hook.&nbsp; Peterkin 
always caught them,&mdash;for we observed that he derived much 
pleasure from fishing,&mdash;while Jack and I found ample 
amusement in looking on, also in gazing down at the coral groves,
and in baiting the hook.&nbsp; Among the fish that we saw, but 
did not catch, were porpoises and sword-fish, whales and 
sharks.&nbsp; The porpoises came frequently into our lagoon in 
shoals, and amused us not a little by their bold leaps into the 
air, and their playful gambols in the sea.&nbsp; The sword-fish 
were wonderful creatures; some of them apparently ten feet in 
length, with an ivory spear, six or eight feet long, projecting 
from their noses.&nbsp; We often saw them darting after other 
fish, and no doubt they sometimes killed them with their ivory 
swords.&nbsp; Jack remembered having heard once of a sword-fish 
attacking a ship,&mdash;which seemed strange indeed; but, as they
are often in the habit of attacking whales, perhaps it mistook 
the ship for one.&nbsp; This sword-fish ran against the vessel 
with such force, that it drove its sword quite through the thick 
planks; and when the ship arrived in harbour, long afterwards, 
the sword was found still sticking in it!</p>
<p>Sharks did not often appear; but we took care never again to 
bathe in deep water without leaving one of our number in the boat
to give us warning, if he should see a shark approaching.&nbsp; 
As for the whales, they never came into our lagoon, but we 
frequently saw them spouting in the deep water beyond the 
reef.&nbsp; I shall never forget my surprise the first day I saw 
one of these huge monsters close to me.&nbsp; We had been 
rambling about on the reef during the morning, and were about to 
re-embark in our little boat, to return home, when a loud blowing
sound caused us to wheel rapidly round.&nbsp; We were just in 
time to see a shower of spray falling, and the flukes or tail of 
some monstrous fish disappear in the sea a few hundred yards 
off.&nbsp; We waited some time to see if he would rise 
again.&nbsp; As we stood, the sea seemed to open up at our very 
feet; an immense spout of water was sent with a snort high into 
the air, and the huge blunt head of a sperm whale arose before 
us.&nbsp; It was so large that it could easily have taken our 
little boat, along with ourselves, into its mouth!&nbsp; It 
plunged slowly back into the sea, like a large ship foundering, 
and struck the water with its tail so forcibly as to cause a 
sound like a cannon shot.&nbsp; We also saw a great number of 
flying fish, although we caught none; and we noticed that they 
never flew out of the water except when followed by their bitter 
foe, the dolphin, from whom they thus endeavoured to 
escape.&nbsp; But of all the fish that we saw, none surprised us 
so much as those that we used to find in shallow pools after a 
shower of rain; and this not on account of their appearance, for 
they were ordinary-looking and very small, but on account of 
their having descended in a shower of rain!&nbsp; We could 
account for them in no other way, because the pools in which we 
found these fish were quite dry before the shower, and at some 
distance above high-water mark.&nbsp; Jack, however, suggested a 
cause which seemed to me very probable.&nbsp; We used often to 
see water-spouts in the sea.&nbsp; A water-spout is a whirling 
body of water, which rises from the sea like a sharp-pointed 
pillar.&nbsp; After rising a good way, it is met by a long 
tongue, which comes down from the clouds; and when the two have 
joined, they look something like an hour-glass.&nbsp; The 
water-spout is then carried by the wind, sometimes gently, 
sometimes with violence, over the sea, sometimes up into the 
clouds, and then, bursting asunder, it descends in a 
deluge.&nbsp; This often happens over the land as well as over 
the sea; and it sometimes does much damage, but frequently it 
passes gently away.&nbsp; Now, Jack thought that the little fish 
might perhaps have been carried up in a water-spout, and so sent 
down again in a shower of rain.&nbsp; But we could not be certain
as to this point; yet we thought it likely.</p>
<p>During these delightful fishing and boating excursions we 
caught a good many eels, which we found to be very good to 
eat.&nbsp; We also found turtles among the coral rocks, and made 
excellent soup in our iron kettle.&nbsp; Moreover, we discovered 
many shrimps and prawns, so that we had no lack of variety in our
food; and, indeed, we never passed a week without making some new
and interesting discovery of some sort or other, either on the 
land or in the sea.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<p>A monster wave and its consequences&mdash;The boat lost and 
found&mdash;Peterkin&rsquo;s terrible accident&mdash;Supplies of 
food for a voyage in the boat&mdash;We visit Penguin Island, and 
are amazed beyond measure&mdash;Account of the penguins.</p>
<p>One day, not long after our little boat was finished, we were 
sitting on the rocks at Spouting Cliff, and talking of an 
excursion which we intended to make to Penguin Island the next 
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Peterkin, &ldquo;it might be all 
very well for a stupid fellow like me to remain here and leave 
the penguins alone, but it would be quite inconsistent with your 
characters as philosophers to remain any longer in ignorance of 
the habits and customs of these birds; so the sooner we go the 
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;there is nothing I 
desire so much as to have a closer inspection of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;that you had 
better remain at home, Peterkin, to take care of the cat; for 
I&rsquo;m sure the hogs will be at it in your absence, out of 
revenge for your killing their great-grandmother so 
recklessly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay at home?&rdquo; cried Peterkin; &ldquo;my dear 
fellow, you would certainly lose your way, or get upset, if I 
were not there to take care of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, true,&rdquo; said Jack, gravely, &ldquo;that did 
not occur to me; no doubt you must go.&nbsp; Our boat does 
require a good deal of ballast; and all that you say, Peterkin, 
carries so much weight with it, that we won&rsquo;t need stones 
if you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, while my companions were talking, a notable event 
occurred, which, as it is not generally known, I shall be 
particular in recording here.</p>
<p>While we were talking, as I have said, we noticed a dark line,
like a low cloud or fog-bank, on the seaward horizon.&nbsp; The 
day was a fine one, though cloudy, and a gentle breeze was 
blowing, but the sea was not rougher, or the breaker on the reef 
higher, than usual.&nbsp; At first we thought that this looked 
like a thunder-cloud; and, as we had had a good deal of broken 
weather of late, accompanied by occasional peals of thunder, we 
supposed that a storm must be approaching.&nbsp; Gradually, 
however, this line seemed to draw nearer, without spreading up 
over the sky, as would certainly have been the case if it had 
been a storm-cloud.&nbsp; Still nearer it came, and soon we saw 
that it was moving swiftly towards the island; but there was no 
sound till it reached the islands out at sea.&nbsp; As it passed 
these islands, we observed, with no little anxiety, that a cloud 
of white foam encircled them, and burst in spray into the air: it
was accompanied by a loud roar.&nbsp; This led us to conjecture 
that the approaching object was an enormous wave of the sea; but 
we had no idea how large it was till it came near to 
ourselves.&nbsp; When it approached the outer reef, however, we 
were awe-struck with its unusual magnitude; and we sprang to our 
feet, and clambered hastily up to the highest point of the 
precipice, under an indefinable feeling of fear.</p>
<p>I have said before that the reef opposite Spouting Cliff was 
very near to the shore, while, just in front of the bower, it was
at a considerable distance out to sea.&nbsp; Owing to this 
formation, the wave reached the reef at the latter point before 
it struck at the foot of Spouting Cliff.&nbsp; The instant it 
touched the reef we became aware, for the first time, of its 
awful magnitude.&nbsp; It burst completely over the reef at all 
points, with a roar that seemed louder to me than thunder; and 
this roar continued for some seconds, while the wave rolled 
gradually along towards the cliff on which we stood.&nbsp; As its
crest reared before us, we felt that we were in great danger, and
turned to flee; but we were too late.&nbsp; With a crash that 
seemed to shake the solid rocks the gigantic billow fell, and 
instantly the spouting-holes sent up a gush of water-spouts with 
such force that they shrieked on issuing from their narrow 
vents.&nbsp; It seemed to us as if the earth had been blown up 
with water.&nbsp; We were stunned and confused by the shock, and 
so drenched and blinded with spray, that we knew not for a few 
moments whither to flee for shelter.&nbsp; At length we all three
gained an eminence beyond the reach of the water; but what a 
scene of devastation met our gaze as we looked along the 
shore!&nbsp; This enormous wave not only burst over the reef, but
continued its way across the lagoon, and fell on the sandy beach 
of the island with such force that passed completely over it and 
dashed into the woods, levelling the smaller trees and bushes in 
its headlong course!</p>
<p>On seeing this, Jack said he feared our bower must have been 
swept away, and that the boat, which was on the beach, must have 
been utterly destroyed.&nbsp; Our hearts sank within us as we 
thought of this, and we hastened round through the woods towards 
our home.&nbsp; On reaching it we found, to our great relief of 
mind, that the force of the wave had been expended just before 
reaching the bower; but the entrance to it was almost blocked up 
by the torn-up bushes and tangled heaps of sea-weed.&nbsp; Having
satisfied ourselves as to the bower, we hurried to the spot where
the boat had been left; but no boat was there!&nbsp; The spot on 
which it had stood was vacant, and no sign of it could we see on 
looking around us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been washed up into the woods,&rdquo; said 
Jack, hurrying up the beach as he spoke.&nbsp; Still, no boat was
to be seen, and we were about to give ourselves over to despair, 
when Peterkin called to Jack and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, my friend, you were once so exceedingly sagacious
and wise as to make me acquainted with the fact that cocoa nuts 
grow upon trees; will you now be so good as to inform me what 
sort of fruit that is growing on the top of yonder bush? for I 
confess to being ignorant, or, at least, doubtful on the 
point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We looked towards the bush indicated, and there, to our 
surprise, beheld our little boat snugly nestled among the 
leaves!&nbsp; We were very much overjoyed at this, for we would 
have suffered any loss rather than the loss of our boat.&nbsp; We
found that the wave had actually borne the boat on its crest from
the beach into the woods, and there launched it into the heart of
this bush; which was extremely fortunate, for had it been tossed 
against a rock or a tree, it would have been dashed to pieces, 
whereas it had not received the smallest injury.&nbsp; It was no 
easy matter, however, to get it out of the bush and down to the 
sea again.&nbsp; This cost us two days of hard labour to 
accomplish.</p>
<p>We had also much ado to clear away the rubbish from before the
bower, and spent nearly a week in constant labour ere we got the 
neighbourhood to look as clean and orderly as before; for the 
uprooted bushes and sea-weed that lay on the beach formed a more 
dreadfully confused-looking mass than one who had not seen the 
place after the inundation could conceive.</p>
<p>Before leaving the subject I may mention, for the sake of 
those who interest themselves in the curious natural phenomena of
our world, that this gigantic wave occurs regularly on some of 
the islands of the Pacific, once, and sometimes twice in the 
year.&nbsp; I heard this stated by the missionaries during my 
career in those seas.&nbsp; They could not tell me whether it 
visited all of the islands, but I was certainly assured that it 
occurred periodically in some of them.</p>
<p>After we had got our home put to rights and cleared of the 
<i>debris</i> of the inundation, we again turned our thoughts to 
paying the penguins a visit.&nbsp; The boat was therefore 
overhauled and a few repairs done.&nbsp; Then we prepared a 
supply of provisions, for we intended to be absent at least a 
night or two, perhaps longer.&nbsp; This took us some time to do,
for while Jack was busy with the boat, Peterkin was sent into the
woods to spear a hog or two, and had to search long, sometimes, 
ere he found them.&nbsp; Peterkin was usually sent on this 
errand, when we wanted a pork chop (which was not seldom), 
because he was so active, and could run so wonderfully fast that 
he found no difficulty in overtaking the hogs; but, being 
dreadfully reckless, he almost invariably tumbled over stumps and
stones in the course of his wild chase, and seldom returned home 
without having knocked the skin off his shins.&nbsp; Once, 
indeed, a more serious accident happened to him.&nbsp; He had 
been out all morning alone and did not return at the usual time 
to dinner.&nbsp; We wondered at this, for Peterkin was always 
very punctual at the dinner hour.&nbsp; As supper-time drew near 
we began to be anxious about him, and at length sallied forth to 
search the woods.&nbsp; For a long time we sought in vain, but a 
little before dark we came upon the tracks of the hogs, which we 
followed up until we came to the brow of a rather steep bank or 
precipice.&nbsp; Looking over this we beheld Peterkin lying in a 
state of insensibility at the foot, with his cheek resting on the
snout of a little pig, which was pinned to the earth by the 
spear!&nbsp; We were dreadfully alarmed, but hastened to bathe 
his forehead with water, and had soon the satisfaction of seeing 
him revive.&nbsp; After we had carried him home he related to as 
how the thing had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I walked about 
all the forenoon, till I was as tired as an old donkey, without 
seeing a single grunter, not so much as a track of one; but, as I
was determined not to return empty-handed, I resolved to go 
without my dinner and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, &ldquo;did you 
<i>really</i> resolve to do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Jack, hold your tongue,&rdquo; returned Peterkin; 
&ldquo;I say that I resolved to forego my dinner and to push to 
the head of the small valley, where I felt pretty sure of 
discovering the hogs.&nbsp; I soon found that I was on the right 
scent, for I had scarcely walked half a mile in the direction of 
the small plum tree we found there the other day, when a squeak 
fell on my ear.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ho, ho,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;there 
you go, my boys;&rsquo; and I hurried up the glen.&nbsp; I soon 
started them, and singling out a fat pig, ran tilt at him.&nbsp; 
In a few seconds I was up with him, and stuck my spear right 
through his dumpy body.&nbsp; Just as I did so, I saw that we 
were on the edge of a precipice, whether high or low I knew not, 
but I had been running at such a pace that I could not stop, so 
the pig and I gave a howl in concert and went plunging over 
together.&nbsp; I remembered nothing more after that, till I came
to my senses and found you bathing my temples, and Ralph wringing
his hands over me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But although Peterkin was often unfortunate, in the way of 
getting tumbles, he was successful on the present occasion in 
hunting, and returned before evening with three very nice little 
hogs.&nbsp; I, also, was successful in my visit to the mud-flats,
where I killed several ducks.&nbsp; So that, when we launched and
loaded our boat at sunrise the following morning, we found our 
store of provisions to be more than sufficient.&nbsp; Part had 
been cooked the night before, and, on taking note of the 
different items, we found the account to stand thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>10 Bread-fruits, (two baked, eight unbaked.)<br />
20 Yams, (six roasted, the rest raw.)<br />
6 Taro roots.<br />
50 Fine large plums.<br />
6 Cocoa nuts, ripe.<br />
6 Ditto green, (for drinking.)<br />
4 Large ducks and two small ones, raw.<br />
3 Cold roast pigs, with stuffing.</p>
<p>I may here remark that the stuffing had been devised by 
Peterkin specially for the occasion.&nbsp; He kept the manner of 
its compounding a profound secret, so I cannot tell what it was; 
but I can say, with much confidence, that we found it to be 
atrociously bad, and, after the first tasting, scraped it 
carefully out and threw it overboard.&nbsp; We calculated that 
this supply would last us for several days, but we afterwards 
found that it was much more than we required, especially in 
regard to the cocoa nuts, of which we found large supplies 
wherever we went.&nbsp; However, as Peterkin remarked, it was 
better to have too much than too little, as we knew not to what 
straits we might be put during our voyage.</p>
<p>It was a very calm sunny morning when we launched forth and 
rowed over the lagoon towards the outlet in the reef, and passed 
between the two green islets that guard the entrance.&nbsp; We 
experienced some difficulty and no little danger in passing the 
surf of the breaker, and shipped a good deal of water in the 
attempt; but, once past the billow, we found ourselves floating 
placidly on the long oily swell that rose and fell slowly as it 
rolled over the wide ocean.</p>
<p>Penguin Island lay on the other side of our own island, at 
about a mile beyond the outer reef, and we calculated that it 
must be at least twenty miles distant by the way we should have 
to go.&nbsp; We might, indeed, have shortened the way by coasting
round our island inside of the lagoon, and going out at the 
passage in the reef nearly opposite to Penguin Island, but we 
preferred to go by the open sea; first, because it was more 
adventurous; and, secondly, because we should have the pleasure 
of again feeling the motion of the deep, which we all loved very 
much, not being liable to sea sickness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we had a breeze,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; cried Peterkin, resting on his oar and 
wiping his heated brow; &ldquo;pulling is hard work.&nbsp; Oh 
dear, if we could only catch a hundred or two of these gulls, tie
them to the boat with long strings, and make them fly as we want 
them, how capital it would be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or bore a hole through a shark&rsquo;s tail, and reeve 
a rope through it, eh?&rdquo; remarked Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, I 
say, it seems that my wish is going to be granted, for here comes
a breeze.&nbsp; Ship your oar, Peterkin.&nbsp; Up with the mast, 
Ralph; I&rsquo;ll see to the sail.&nbsp; Mind your helm; look out
for squalls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last speech was caused by the sudden appearance of a dark
blue line on the horizon, which, in an incredibly short space of 
time, swept down on us, lashing up the sea in white foam as it 
went.&nbsp; We presented the stern of the boat to its first 
violence, and, in a few seconds, it moderated into a steady 
breeze, to which we spread our sail and flew merrily over the 
waves.&nbsp; Although the breeze died away soon afterwards, it 
had been so stiff while it lasted, that we were carried over the 
greater part of our way before it fell calm again; so that, when 
the flapping of the sail against the mast told us that it was 
time to resume the oars, we were not much more than a mile from 
Penguin Island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There go the soldiers!&rdquo; cried Peterkin as we came
in sight of it; &ldquo;how spruce their white trousers look, this
morning!&nbsp; I wonder if they will receive us kindly.&nbsp; 
D&rsquo;you think they are hospitable, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk, Peterkin, but pull away, and you 
shall see shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we drew near to the island we were much amused by the 
manoeuvres and appearance of these strange birds.&nbsp; They 
seemed to be of different species, for some had crests on their 
heads while others had none, and while some were about the size 
of a goose others appeared nearly as large as a swan.&nbsp; We 
also saw a huge albatross soaring above the heads of the 
penguins.&nbsp; It was followed and surrounded by numerous flocks
of sea-gulls.&nbsp; Having approached to within a few yards of 
the island, which was a low rock, with no other vegetation on it 
than a few bushes, we lay on our oars and gazed at the birds with
surprise and pleasure, they returning our gaze with 
interest.&nbsp; We now saw that their soldier-like appearance was
owing to the stiff, erect manner in which they sat on their short
legs,&mdash;&ldquo;Bolt-up-right,&rdquo; as Peterkin expressed 
it.&nbsp; They had black heads, long sharp beaks, white breasts, 
and bluish backs.&nbsp; Their wings were so short that they 
looked more like the fins of a fish, and, indeed, we soon saw 
that they used them for the purpose of swimming under 
water.&nbsp; There were no quills on these wings, but a sort of 
scaly feathers; which also thickly covered their bodies.&nbsp; 
Their legs were short, and placed so far back that the birds, 
while on land, were obliged to stand quite upright in order to 
keep their balance; but in the water they floated like other 
water-fowl.&nbsp; At first we were so stunned with the clamour 
which they and other sea-birds kept up around us, that we knew 
not which way to look,&mdash;for they covered the rocks in 
thousands; but, as we continued to gaze, we observed several 
quadrupeds (as we thought) walking in the midst of the 
penguins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull in a bit,&rdquo; cried Peterkin, &ldquo;and 
let&rsquo;s see what these are.&nbsp; They must be fond of noisy 
company, to consort with such creatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To our surprise we found that these were no other than 
penguins which had gone down on all fours, and were crawling 
among the bushes on their feet and wings, just like 
quadrupeds.&nbsp; Suddenly one big old bird, that had been 
sitting on a point very near to us, gazing in mute astonishment, 
became alarmed, and, scuttling down the rocks, plumped or fell, 
rather than ran, into the sea.&nbsp; It dived in a moment, and, a
few seconds afterwards, came out of the water far a-head, with 
such a spring, and such a dive back into the sea again, that we 
could scarcely believe it was not a fish that had leaped in 
sport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That beats everything,&rdquo; said Peterkin, rubbing 
his nose, and screwing up his face with an expression of 
exasperated amazement.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of a thing 
being neither fish, flesh, nor fowl, but I never did expect to 
live to see a brute that was all three together,&mdash;at 
once&mdash;in one!&nbsp; But look there!&rdquo; he continued, 
pointing with a look of resignation to the shore, &ldquo;look 
there! there&rsquo;s no end to it.&nbsp; What <i>has</i> that 
brute got under its tail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We turned to look in the direction pointed out, and there saw 
a penguin walking slowly and very sedately along the shore with 
an egg under its tail.&nbsp; There were several others, we 
observed, burdened in the same way; and we found afterwards that 
these were a species of penguins that always carried their eggs 
so.&nbsp; Indeed, they had a most convenient cavity for the 
purpose, just between the tail and the legs.&nbsp; We were very 
much impressed with the regularity and order of this 
colony.&nbsp; The island seemed to be apportioned out into 
squares, of which each penguin possessed one, and sat in stiff 
solemnity in the middle of it, or took a slow march up and down 
the spaces between.&nbsp; Some were hatching their eggs, but 
others were feeding their young ones in a manner that caused us 
to laugh not a little.&nbsp; The mother stood on a mound or 
raised rock, while the young one stood patiently below her on the
ground.&nbsp; Suddenly the mother raised her head and uttered a 
series of the most discordant cackling sounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to choke,&rdquo; cried Peterkin.</p>
<p>But this was not the case, although, I confess, she looked 
like it.&nbsp; In a few seconds she put down her head and opened 
her mouth, into which the young one thrust its beak and seemed to
suck something from her throat.&nbsp; Then the cackling was 
renewed, the sucking continued, and so the operation of feeding 
was carried on till the young one was satisfied; but what she fed
her little one with, we could not tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, just look yonder!&rdquo; said Peterkin, in an 
excited tone; &ldquo;if that isn&rsquo;t the most abominable 
piece of maternal deception I ever saw.&nbsp; That rascally old 
lady penguin has just pitched her young one into the sea, and 
there&rsquo;s another about to follow her example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This indeed seemed to be the cue, for, on the top of a steep 
rock close to the edge of the sea, we observed an old penguin 
endeavouring to entice her young one into the water; but the 
young one seemed very unwilling to go, and, notwithstanding the 
enticements of its mother, moved very slowly towards her.&nbsp; 
At last she went gently behind the young bird and pushed it a 
little towards the water, but with great tenderness, as much as 
to say, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, darling!&nbsp; I 
won&rsquo;t hurt you, my pet!&rsquo; but no sooner did she get it
to the edge of the rock, where it stood looking pensively down at
the sea, than she gave it a sudden and violent push, sending it 
headlong down the slope into the water, where its mother left it 
to scramble ashore as it best could.&nbsp; We observed many of 
them employed in doing this, and we came to the conclusion that 
this is the way in which old penguins teach their children to 
swim.</p>
<p>Scarcely had we finished making our remarks on this, when we 
were startled by about a dozen of the old birds hopping in the 
most clumsy and ludicrous manner towards the sea.&nbsp; The 
beach, here, was a sloping rock, and when they came to it, some 
of them succeeded in hopping down in safety, but others lost 
their balance and rolled and scrambled down the slope in the most
helpless manner.&nbsp; The instant they reached the water, 
however, they seemed to be in their proper element.&nbsp; They 
dived and bounded out of it and into it again with the utmost 
agility; and so, diving and bounding and spluttering, for they 
could not fly, they went rapidly out to sea.</p>
<p>On seeing this, Peterkin turned with a grave face to us and 
said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my opinion that these birds are all 
stark, staring mad, and that this is an enchanted island.&nbsp; I
therefore propose that we should either put about ship and fly in
terror from the spot, or land valorously on the island, and sell 
our lives as dearly as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I vote for landing, so pull in, lads,&rdquo; said Jack,
giving a stroke with his oar that made the boat spin.&nbsp; In a 
few seconds we ran the boat into a little creek where we made her
fast to a projecting piece of coral, and, running up the beach, 
entered the ranks of the penguins armed with our cudgels and our 
spear.&nbsp; We were greatly surprised to find that, instead of 
attacking us or showing signs of fear at our approach, these 
curious birds did not move from their places until we laid hands 
on them, and merely turned their eyes on us in solemn, stupid 
wonder as we passed.&nbsp; There was one old penguin, however, 
that began to walk slowly toward the sea, and Peterkin took it 
into his head that he would try to interrupt its progress, so he 
ran between it and the sea and brandished his cudgel in its 
face.&nbsp; But this proved to be a resolute old bird.&nbsp; It 
would not retreat; nay, more, it would not cease to advance, but 
battled with Peterkin bravely and drove him before it until it 
reached the sea.&nbsp; Had Peterkin used his club he could easily
have felled it, no doubt; but, as he had no wish to do so cruel 
an act merely out of sport, he let the bird escape.</p>
<p>We spent fully three hours on this island in watching the 
habits of these curious birds, and, when we finally left them, we
all three concluded, after much consultation, that they were the 
most wonderful creatures we had ever seen; and further, we 
thought it probable that they were the most wonderful creatures 
in the world!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<p>An awful storm and its consequences&mdash;Narrow 
escape&mdash;A rock proves a sure foundation&mdash;A fearful 
night and a bright morning&mdash;Deliverance from danger.</p>
<p>It was evening before we left the island of the 
penguins.&nbsp; As we had made up our minds to encamp for the 
night on a small island, whereon grew a few cocoa-nut trees, 
which was about two miles off, we lay to our oars with some 
energy.&nbsp; But a danger was in store for us which we had not 
anticipated.&nbsp; The wind, which had carried us so quickly to 
Penguin Island, freshened as evening drew on, to a stiff breeze, 
and, before we had made half the distance to the small island, it
became a regular gale.&nbsp; Although it was not so directly 
against us as to prevent our rowing in the course we wished to 
go, yet it checked us very much; and although the force of the 
sea was somewhat broken by the island, the waves soon began to 
rise, and to roll their broken crests against our small craft, so
that she began to take in water, and we had much ado to keep 
ourselves afloat.&nbsp; At last the wind and sea together became 
so violent that we found it impossible to make the island, so 
Jack suddenly put the head of the boat round and ordered Peterkin
and me to hoist a corner of the sail, intending to run back to 
Penguin Island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall at least have the shelter of the 
bushes,&rdquo; he said, as the boat flew before the wind, 
&ldquo;and the penguins will keep us company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jack spoke, the wind suddenly shifted, and blew so much 
against us that we were forced to hoist more of the sail in order
to beat up for the island, being by this change thrown much to 
leeward of it.&nbsp; What made matters worse was, that the gale 
came in squalls, so that we were more than once nearly upset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand by, both of you,&rdquo; cried Jack, in a quick, 
earnest tone; &ldquo;be ready to dowse the sail.&nbsp; I very 
much fear we won&rsquo;t make the island after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peterkin and I were so much in the habit of trusting 
everything to Jack that we had fallen into the way of not 
considering things, especially such things as were under 
Jack&rsquo;s care.&nbsp; We had, therefore, never doubted for a 
moment that all was going well, so that it was with no little 
anxiety that we heard him make the above remark.&nbsp; However, 
we had no time for question or surmise, for, at the moment he 
spoke, a heavy squall was bearing down upon us, and, as we were 
then flying with our lee gunwale dipping occasionally under the 
waves, it was evident that we should have to lower our sail 
altogether.&nbsp; In a few seconds the squall struck the boat, 
but Peterkin and I had the sail down in a moment, so that it did 
not upset us; but, when it was past, we were more than half full 
of water.&nbsp; This I soon baled out, while Peterkin again 
hoisted a corner of the sail; but the evil which Jack had feared 
came upon us.&nbsp; We found it quite impossible to make Penguin 
Island.&nbsp; The gale carried us quickly past it towards the 
open sea, and the terrible truth flashed upon us that we should 
be swept out and left to perish miserably in a small boat in the 
midst of the wide ocean.</p>
<p>This idea was forced very strongly upon us because we saw 
nothing in the direction whither the wind was blowing us save the
raging billows of the sea; and, indeed, we trembled as we gazed 
around us, for we were now beyond the shelter of the islands, and
it seemed as though any of the huge billows, which curled over in
masses of foam, might swallow us up in a moment.&nbsp; The water,
also, began to wash in over our sides, and I had to keep 
constantly baling, for Jack could not quit the helm nor Peterkin 
the sail for an instant, without endangering our lives.&nbsp; In 
the midst of this distress Jack uttered an exclamation of hope, 
and pointed towards a low island or rock which lay directly 
ahead.&nbsp; It had been hitherto unobserved, owing to the dark 
clouds that obscured the sky and the blinding spray that seemed 
to fill the whole atmosphere.</p>
<p>As we neared this rock we observed that it was quite destitute
of trees and verdure, and so low that the sea broke completely 
over it.&nbsp; In fact it was nothing more than the summit of one
of the coral formations, which rose only a few feet above the 
level of the water, and was, in stormy weather, all but 
invisible.&nbsp; Over this island the waves were breaking in the 
utmost fury, and our hearts sank within us as we saw that there 
was not a spot where we could thrust our little boat without its 
being dashed to pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show a little bit more sail,&rdquo; cried Jack, as we 
swept past the weather side of the rock with fearful speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; answered Peterkin, hoisting about a foot
more of our sail.</p>
<p>Little though the addition was it caused the boat to lie over 
and creak so loudly, as we cleft the foaming waves, that I 
expected to be upset every instant; and I blamed Jack in my heart
for his rashness.&nbsp; But I did him injustice, for, although 
during two seconds the water rushed in-board in a torrent, he 
succeeded in steering us sharply round to the leeward side of the
rock, where the water was comparatively calm, and the force of 
the breeze broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out your oars now, lads; that&rsquo;s well done.&nbsp; 
Give way!&rdquo;&nbsp; We obeyed instantly.&nbsp; The oars 
splashed into the waves together.&nbsp; One good hearty pull, and
we were floating in a comparatively calm creek that was so narrow
as to be barely able to admit our boat.&nbsp; Here we were in 
perfect safety, and, as we leaped on shore and fastened our cable
to the rocks, I thanked God in my heart for our deliverance from 
so great danger.&nbsp; But, although I have said we were now in 
safety, I suspect that few of my readers would have envied our 
position.&nbsp; It is true we had no lack of food, but we were 
drenched to the skin; the sea was foaming round us and the spray 
flying over our heads, so that we were completely enveloped, as 
it were, in water; the spot on which we had landed was not more 
than twelve yards in diameter, and from this spot we could not 
move without the risk of being swept away by the storm.&nbsp; At 
the upper end of the creek was a small hollow or cave in the 
rock, which sheltered us from the fury of the winds and waves; 
and as the rock extended in a sort of ledge over our heads, it 
prevented the spray from falling upon us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Peterkin, beginning to feel cheery 
again, &ldquo;it seems to me that we have got into a 
mermaid&rsquo;s cave, for there is nothing but water all round 
us; and as for earth or sky, they are things of the 
past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peterkin&rsquo;s idea was not inappropriate, for, what with 
the sea roaring in white foam up to our very feet, and the spray 
flying in white sheets continually over our heads, and the water 
dripping heavily from the ledge above like a curtain in front of 
our cave, it did seem to us very much more like being below than 
above water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; cried Jack, &ldquo;bestir yourselves,
and let&rsquo;s make ourselves comfortable.&nbsp; Toss out our 
provisions, Peterkin; and here, Ralph, lend a hand to haul up the
boat.&nbsp; Look sharp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, captain,&rdquo; we cried, as we hastened to 
obey, much cheered by the hearty manner of our comrade.</p>
<p>Fortunately the cave, although not very deep, was quite dry, 
so that we succeeded in making ourselves much more comfortable 
than could have been expected.&nbsp; We landed our provisions, 
wrung the water out of our garments, spread our sail below us for
a carpet, and, after having eaten a hearty meal, began to feel 
quite cheerful.&nbsp; But as night drew on, our spirits sank 
again, for with the daylight all evidence of our security 
vanished away.&nbsp; We could no longer see the firm rock on 
which we lay, while we were stunned with the violence of the 
tempest that raged around us.&nbsp; The night grew pitchy dark, 
as it advanced, so that we could not see our hands when we held 
them up before our eyes, and were obliged to feel each other 
occasionally to make sure that we were safe, for the storm at 
last became so terrible that it was difficult to make our voices 
audible.&nbsp; A slight variation of the wind, as we supposed, 
caused a few drops of spray ever and anon to blow into our faces;
and the eddy of the sea, in its mad boiling, washed up into our 
little creek until it reached our feet and threatened to tear 
away our boat.&nbsp; In order to prevent this latter calamity, we
hauled the boat farther up and held the cable in our hands.&nbsp;
Occasional flashes of lightning shone with a ghastly glare 
through the watery curtains around us, and lent additional horror
to the scene.&nbsp; Yet we longed for those dismal flashes, for 
they were less appalling than the thick blackness that succeeded 
them.&nbsp; Crashing peals of thunder seemed to tear the skies in
twain, and fell upon our ears through the wild yelling of the 
hurricane as if it had been but a gentle summer breeze; while the
billows burst upon the weather side of the island until we 
fancied that the solid rock was giving way, and, in our agony, we
clung to the bare ground, expecting every moment to be whirled 
away and whelmed in the black howling sea!&nbsp; Oh! it was a 
night of terrible anxiety, and no one can conceive the feelings 
of intense gratitude and relief with which we at last saw the 
dawn of day break through the vapory mists around us.</p>
<p>For three days and three nights we remained on this rock, 
while the storm continued to rage with unabated fury.&nbsp; On 
the morning of the fourth day it suddenly ceased, and the wind 
fell altogether; but the waves still ran so high that we did not 
dare to put off in our boat.&nbsp; During the greater part of 
this period we scarcely slept above a few minutes at a time, but 
on the third night we slept soundly and awoke early on the fourth
morning to find the sea very much down, and the sun shining 
brightly again in the clear blue sky.</p>
<p>It was with light hearts that we launched forth once more in 
our little boat and steered away for our island home, which, we 
were overjoyed to find, was quite visible on the horizon, for we 
had feared that we had been blown out of sight of it 
altogether.&nbsp; As it was a dead calm we had to row during the 
greater part of the day; but towards the afternoon a fair breeze 
sprang up, which enabled us to hoist our sail.&nbsp; We soon 
passed Penguin Island, and the other island which we had failed 
to reach on the day the storm commenced; but as we had still 
enough of provisions, and were anxious to get home, we did not 
land, to the great disappointment of Peterkin, who seemed to 
entertain quite an affection for the penguins.</p>
<p>Although the breeze was pretty fresh for several hours, we did
not reach the outer reef of our island till night-fall, and 
before we had sailed more than a hundred yards into the lagoon, 
the wind died away altogether, so that we had to take to our oars
again.&nbsp; It was late and the moon and stars were shining 
brightly when we arrived opposite the bower and leaped upon the 
strand.&nbsp; So glad were we to be safe back again on our 
beloved island, that we scarcely took time to drag the boat a 
short way up the beach, and then ran up to see that all was right
at the bower.&nbsp; I must confess, however, that my joy was 
mingled with a vague sort of fear lest our home had been visited 
and destroyed during our absence; but on reaching it we found 
everything just as it had been left, and the poor black cat 
curled up, sound asleep, on the coral table in front of our 
humble dwelling.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<p>Shoemaking&mdash;The even tenor of our way suddenly 
interrupted&mdash;An unexpected visit and an appalling 
battle&mdash;We all become warriors, and Jack proves himself be a
hero.</p>
<p>For many months after this we continued to live on our island 
in uninterrupted harmony and happiness.&nbsp; Sometimes we went 
out a-fishing in the lagoon, and sometimes went a-hunting in the 
woods, or ascended to the mountain top, by way of variety, 
although Peterkin always asserted that we went for the purpose of
hailing any ship that might chance to heave in sight.&nbsp; But I
am certain that none of us wished to be delivered from our 
captivity, for we were extremely happy, and Peterkin used to say 
that as we were very young we should not feel the loss of a year 
or two.&nbsp; Peterkin, as I have said before, was thirteen years
of age, Jack eighteen, and I fifteen.&nbsp; But Jack was very 
tall, strong, and manly for his age, and might easily have been 
mistaken for twenty.</p>
<p>The climate was so beautiful that it seemed to be a perpetual 
summer, and as many of the fruit-trees continued to bear fruit 
and blossom all the year round, we never wanted for a plentiful 
supply of food.&nbsp; The hogs, too, seemed rather to increase 
than diminish, although Peterkin was very frequent in his attacks
on them with his spear.&nbsp; If at any time we failed in finding
a drove, we had only to pay a visit to the plum-tree before 
mentioned, where we always found a large family of them asleep 
under its branches.</p>
<p>We employed ourselves very busily during this time in making 
various garments of cocoa-nut cloth, as those with which we had 
landed were beginning to be very ragged.&nbsp; Peterkin also 
succeeded in making excellent shoes out of the skin of the old 
hog, in the following manner:&mdash;He first cut a piece of the 
hide, of an oblong form, a few inches longer than his foot.&nbsp;
This he soaked in water, and, while it was wet, he sewed up one 
end of it, so as to form a rough imitation of that part of the 
heel of a shoe where the seam is.&nbsp; This done, he bored a row
of holes all round the edge of the piece of skin, through which a
tough line was passed.&nbsp; Into the sewed-up part of this shoe 
he thrust his heel, then, drawing the string tight, the edges 
rose up and overlapped his foot all round.&nbsp; It is true there
were a great many ill-looking puckers in these shoes, but we 
found them very serviceable notwithstanding, and Jack came at 
last to prefer them to his long boots.&nbsp; We ago made various 
other useful articles, which added to our comfort, and once or 
twice spoke of building us a house, but we had so great an 
affection for the bower, and, withal, found it so serviceable, 
that we determined not to leave it, nor to attempt the building 
of a house, which, in such a climate, might turn out to be rather
disagreeable than useful.</p>
<p>We often examined the pistol that we had found in the house on
the other side of the island, and Peterkin wished much that we 
had powder and shot, as it would render pig-killing much easier; 
but, after all, we had become so expert in the use of our sling 
and bow and spear, that we were independent of more deadly 
weapons.</p>
<p>Diving in the Water Garden also continued to afford us as much
pleasure as ever; and Peterkin began to be a little more expert 
in the water from constant practice.&nbsp; As for Jack and I, we 
began to feel as if water were our native element, and revelled 
in it with so much confidence and comfort that Peterkin said he 
feared we would turn into fish some day, and swim off and leave 
him; adding, that he had been for a long time observing that Jack
was becoming more and more like a shark every day.&nbsp; 
Whereupon Jack remarked, that if he, Peterkin, were changed into 
a fish, he would certainly turn into nothing better or bigger 
than a shrimp.&nbsp; Poor Peterkin did not envy us our delightful
excursions under water, except, indeed, when Jack would dive down
to the bottom of the Water Garden, sit down on a rock and look up
and make faces at him.&nbsp; Peterkin did feel envious then, and 
often said he would give anything to be able to do that.&nbsp; I 
was much amused when Peterkin said this; for if he could only 
have seen his own face when he happened to take a short dive, he 
would have seen that Jack&rsquo;s was far surpassed by it.&nbsp; 
The great difference being, however, that Jack made faces on 
purpose&mdash;Peterkin couldn&rsquo;t help it!</p>
<p>Now, while we were engaged with these occupations and 
amusements, an event occurred one day which was as unexpected as 
it was exceedingly alarming and very horrible.</p>
<p>Jack and I were sitting, as we were often wont to do, on the 
rocks at Spouting Cliff, and Peterkin was wringing the water from
his garments, having recently fallen by accident into the 
sea,&mdash;a thing he was constantly doing,&mdash;when our 
attention was suddenly arrested by two objects which appeared on 
the horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are yon, think you?&rdquo; I said, addressing 
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; answered he; 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed them for some time, and fancied they 
were black sea-gulls, but the more I look at them the more I feel
convinced they are much larger than gulls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem to be coming towards us,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo! what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; inquired Peterkin, 
coming up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look there,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whales!&rdquo; cried Peterkin, shading his eyes with 
his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;No! eh! can they be boats, 
Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our hearts beat with excitement at the very thought of seeing 
human faces again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are about right, Peterkin;&mdash;but they 
seem to me to move strangely for boats,&rdquo; said Jack, in a 
low tone, as if he were talking to himself.</p>
<p>I noticed that a shade of anxiety crossed Jack&rsquo;s 
countenance as he gazed long and intently at the two objects, 
which were now nearing us fast.&nbsp; At last he sprang to his 
feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are canoes, Ralph! whether war-canoes or 
not I cannot tell, but this I know, that all the natives of the 
South Sea Islands are fierce cannibals, and they have little 
respect for strangers.&nbsp; We must hide if they land here, 
which I earnestly hope they will not do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was greatly alarmed at Jack&rsquo;s speech, but I confess I 
thought less of what he said than of the earnest, anxious manner 
in which he said it, and it was with very uncomfortable feelings 
that Peterkin and I followed him quickly into the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How unfortunate,&rdquo; said I, as we gained the 
shelter of the bushes, &ldquo;that we have forgotten our 
arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It matters not,&rdquo; said Jack; &ldquo;here are clubs
enough and to spare.&rdquo;&nbsp; As he spoke, he laid his hand 
on a bundle of stout poles of various sizes, which 
Peterkin&rsquo;s ever-busy hands had formed, during our frequent 
visits to the cliff, for no other purpose, apparently, than that 
of having something to do.</p>
<p>We each selected a stout club according to our several tastes,
and lay down behind a rock, whence we could see the canoes 
approach, without ourselves being seen.&nbsp; At first we made an
occasional remark on their appearance, but after they entered the
lagoon, and drew near the beach, we ceased to speak, and gazed 
with intense interest at the scene before us.</p>
<p>We now observed that the foremost canoe was being chased by 
the other, and that it contained a few women and children, as 
well as men,&mdash;perhaps forty souls altogether; while the 
canoe which pursued it contained only men.&nbsp; They seemed to 
be about the same in number, but were better armed, and had the 
appearance of being a war party.&nbsp; Both crews were paddling 
with all their might, and it seemed as if the pursuers exerted 
themselves to overtake the natives ere they could land.&nbsp; In 
this, however, they failed.&nbsp; The foremost canoe made for the
beach close beneath the rocks behind which we were 
concealed.&nbsp; Their short paddles flashed like meteors in the 
water, and sent up a constant shower of spray.&nbsp; The foam 
curled from the prow, and the eyes of the rowers glistened in 
their black faces as they strained every muscle of their naked 
bodies; nor did they relax their efforts till the canoe struck 
the beach with a violent shock; then, with a shout of defiance, 
the whole party sprang, as if by magic, from the canoe to the 
shore.&nbsp; Three women, two of whom carried infants in their 
arms, rushed into the woods; and the men crowded to the 
water&rsquo;s edge, with stones in their hands, spears levelled, 
and clubs brandished, to resist the landing of their enemies.</p>
<p>The distance between the two canoes had been about half a 
mile, and, at the great speed they were going, this was soon 
passed.&nbsp; As the pursuers neared the shore, no sign of fear 
or hesitation was noticeable.&nbsp; On they came like a wild 
charger,&mdash;received but recked not of a shower of 
stones.&nbsp; The canoe struck, and, with a yell that seemed to 
issue from the throats of incarnate fiends, they leaped into the 
water, and drove their enemies up the beach.</p>
<p>The battle that immediately ensued was frightful to 
behold.&nbsp; Most of the men wielded clubs of enormous size and 
curious shapes, with which they dashed out each other&rsquo;s 
brains.&nbsp; As they were almost entirely naked, and had to 
bound, stoop, leap, and run, in their terrible hand-to-hand 
encounters, they looked more like demons than human beings.&nbsp;
I felt my heart grow sick at the sight of this bloody battle, and
would fain have turned away, but a species of fascination seemed 
to hold me down and glue my eyes upon the combatants.&nbsp; I 
observed that the attacking party was led by a most extraordinary
being, who, from his size and peculiarity, I concluded was a 
chief.&nbsp; His hair was frizzed out to an enormous extent, so 
that it resembled a large turban.&nbsp; It was of a light-yellow 
hue, which surprised me much, for the man&rsquo;s body was as 
black as coal, and I felt convinced that the hair must have been 
dyed.&nbsp; He was tattooed from head to foot; and his face, 
besides being tattooed, was besmeared with red paint, and 
streaked with white.&nbsp; Altogether, with his yellow 
turban-like hair, his Herculean black frame, his glittering eyes 
and white teeth, he seemed the most terrible monster I ever 
beheld.&nbsp; He was very active in the fight, and had already 
killed four men.</p>
<p>Suddenly the yellow-haired chief was attacked by a man quite 
as strong and large as himself.&nbsp; He flourished a heavy club 
something like an eagle&rsquo;s beak at the point.&nbsp; For a 
second or two these giants eyed each other warily, moving round 
and round, as if to catch each other at a disadvantage, but 
seeing that nothing was to be gained by this caution, and that 
the loss of time might effectually turn the tide of battle either
way, they apparently made up their minds to attack at the same 
instant, for, with a wild shout and simultaneous spring, they 
swung their heavy clubs, which met with a loud report.&nbsp; 
Suddenly the yellow-haired savage tripped, his enemy sprang 
forward, the ponderous club was swung, but it did not descend, 
for at that moment the savage was felled to the ground by a stone
from the hand of one who had witnessed his chief&rsquo;s 
danger.&nbsp; This was the turning-point in the battle.&nbsp; The
savages who landed first turned and fled towards the bush, on 
seeing the fall of their chief.&nbsp; But not one escaped.&nbsp; 
They were all overtaken and felled to the earth.&nbsp; I saw, 
however, that they were not all killed.&nbsp; Indeed, their 
enemies, now that they were conquered, seemed anxious to take 
them alive; and they succeeded in securing fifteen, whom they 
bound hand and foot with cords, and, carrying them up into the 
woods, laid them down among the bushes.&nbsp; Here they left 
them, for what purpose I knew not, and returned to the scene of 
the late battle, where the remnant of the party were bathing 
their wounds.</p>
<p>Out of the forty blacks that composed the attacking party, 
only twenty-eight remained alive, two of whom were sent into the 
bush to hunt for the women and children.&nbsp; Of the other 
party, as I have said, only ten survived, and these were lying 
bound and helpless on the grass.</p>
<p>Jack and Peterkin and I now looked at each other, and 
whispered our fears that the savages might clamber up the rocks 
to search for fresh water, and so discover our place of 
concealment; but we were so much interested in watching their 
movements that we agreed to remain where we were; and, indeed, we
could not easily have risen without exposing ourselves to 
detection.&nbsp; One of the savages now went up to the wood and 
soon returned with a bundle of fire-wood, and we were not a 
little surprised to see him set fire to it by the very same means
used by Jack the time we made our first fire,&mdash;namely, with 
the bow and drill.&nbsp; When the fire was kindled, two of the 
party went again to the woods and returned with one of the bound 
men.&nbsp; A dreadful feeling of horror crept over my heart, as 
the thought flashed upon me that they were going to burn their 
enemies.&nbsp; As they bore him to the fire my feelings almost 
overpowered me.&nbsp; I gasped for breath, and seizing my club, 
endeavoured to spring to my feet; but Jack&rsquo;s powerful arm 
pinned me to the earth.&nbsp; Next moment one of the savages 
raised his club, and fractured the wretched creature&rsquo;s 
skull.&nbsp; He must have died instantly, and, strange though it 
may seem, I confess to a feeling of relief when the deed was 
done, because I now knew that the poor savage could not be burned
alive.&nbsp; Scarcely had his limbs ceased to quiver when the 
monsters cut slices of flesh from his body, and, after roasting 
them slightly over the fire, devoured them.</p>
<p>Suddenly there arose a cry from the woods, and, in a few 
seconds, the two savages hastened towards the fire dragging the 
three women and their two infants along with them.&nbsp; One of 
those women was much younger than her companions, and we were 
struck with the modesty of her demeanour and the gentle 
expression of her face, which, although she had the flattish nose
and thick lips of the others, was of a light-brown colour, and we
conjectured that she must be of a different race.&nbsp; She and 
her companions wore short petticoats and a kind of tippet on 
their shoulders.&nbsp; Their hair was jet black, but instead of 
being long, was short and curly,&mdash;though not 
woolly&mdash;somewhat like the hair of a young boy.&nbsp; While 
we gazed with interest and some anxiety at these poor creatures, 
the big chief advanced to one of the elder females and laid his 
hand upon the child.&nbsp; But the mother shrank from him, and 
clasping the little one to her bosom, uttered a wail of 
fear.&nbsp; With a savage laugh, the chief tore the child from 
her arms and tossed it into the sea.&nbsp; A low groan burst from
Jack&rsquo;s lips as we witnessed this atrocious act and heard 
the mother&rsquo;s shriek, as she fell insensible on the 
sand.&nbsp; The rippling waves rolled the child on the beach, as 
if they refused to be a party in such a foul murder, and we could
observe that the little one still lived.</p>
<p>The young girl was now brought forward, and the chief 
addressed her; but although we heard his voice, and even the 
words distinctly, of course we could not understand what he 
said.&nbsp; The girl made no answer to his fierce questions, and 
we saw by the way in which he pointed to the fire that he 
threatened her life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peterkin,&rdquo; said Jack in a hoarse whisper, 
&ldquo;have you got your knife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Peterkin, whose face was pale as 
death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do.&nbsp; Listen to me, and do my bidding 
quick.&nbsp; Here is the small knife, Ralph.&nbsp; Fly both of 
you through the bush, cut the cords that bind the prisoners and 
set them free.&nbsp; There! quick, ere it be too 
late.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jack sprang up, and seized a heavy but short 
bludgeon, while his strong frame trembled with emotion, and large
drops rolled down his forehead.</p>
<p>At this moment the man who had butchered the savage a few 
minutes before advanced towards the girl with his heavy 
club.&nbsp; Jack uttered a yell that rang like a death-shriek 
among the rocks.&nbsp; With one bound he leaped over a precipice 
full fifteen feet high, and, before the savages had recovered 
from their surprise, was in the midst of them; while Peterkin and
I dashed through the bushes towards the prisoners.&nbsp; With one
blow of his staff Jack felled the man with the club, then, 
turning round with a look of fury, he rushed upon the big chief 
with the yellow hair.&nbsp; Had the blow which Jack aimed at his 
head taken effect, the huge savage would have needed no second 
stroke; but he was agile as a cat, and avoided it by springing to
one side, while, at the same time, he swung his ponderous club at
the head of his foe.&nbsp; It was now Jack&rsquo;s turn to leap 
aside, and well was it for him that the first outburst of his 
blind fury was over, else he had become an easy prey to his 
gigantic antagonist; but Jack was cool now.&nbsp; He darted his 
blows rapidly and well, and the superiority of his light weapon 
was strikingly proved in this combat, for while he could easily 
evade the blows of the chief&rsquo;s heavy club, the chief could 
not so easily evade those of his light one.&nbsp; Nevertheless, 
so quick was he, and so frightfully did he fling about the mighty
weapon, that, although Jack struck him almost every blow, the 
strokes had to be delivered so quickly that they wanted force to 
be very effectual.</p>
<p>It was lucky for Jack that the other savages considered the 
success of their chief in this encounter to be so certain that 
they refrained from interfering.&nbsp; Had they doubted it, they 
would have probably ended the matter at once by felling 
him.&nbsp; But they contented themselves with awaiting the 
issue.</p>
<p>The force which the chief expended in wielding his club now 
began to be apparent.&nbsp; His movements became slower, his 
breath hissed through his clenched teeth, and the surprised 
savages drew nearer in order to render assistance.&nbsp; Jack 
observed this movement.&nbsp; He felt that his fate was sealed, 
and resolved to cast his life upon the next blow.&nbsp; The 
chiefs club was again about to descend on his head.&nbsp; He 
might have evaded it easily, but instead of doing so, he suddenly
shortened his grasp of his own club, rushed in under the blow, 
struck his adversary right between the eyes with all his force 
and fell to the earth, crushed beneath the senseless body of the 
chief.&nbsp; A dozen clubs flew high in air ready to descend on 
the head of Jack, but they hesitated a moment, for the massive 
body of the chief completely covered him.&nbsp; That moment saved
his life.&nbsp; Ere the savages could tear the chief&rsquo;s body
away, seven of their number fell prostrate beneath the clubs of 
the prisoners whom Peterkin and I had set free, and two others 
fell under our own hand.&nbsp; We could never have accomplished 
this had not our enemies been so engrossed with the fight between
Jack and their chief that they had failed to observe us until we 
were upon them.&nbsp; They still out-numbered our party by three,
but we were flushed with victory while they were taken by 
surprise and dispirited by the fall of their chief.&nbsp; 
Moreover, they were awe-struck by the sweeping fury of Jack, who 
seemed to have lost his senses altogether, and had no sooner 
shaken himself free of the chief&rsquo;s body than he rushed into
the midst of them, and in three blows equalized our 
numbers.&nbsp; Peterkin and I flew to the rescue, the savages 
followed us, and, in less than ten minutes, the whole of our 
opponents were knocked down or made prisoners, bound hand and 
foot, and extended side by side upon the sea shore.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<p>Intercourse with the savages&mdash;Cannibalism 
prevented&mdash;The slain are buried and the survivors depart, 
leaving us again alone on our Coral Island.</p>
<p>After the battle was over, the savages crowded round us and 
gazed at us in surprise, while they continued to pour upon us a 
flood of questions, which, being wholly unintelligible, of course
we could not answer.&nbsp; However, by way of putting an end to 
it, Jack took the chief (who had recovered from the effects of 
his wound) by the hand and shook it warmly.&nbsp; No sooner did 
the blacks see that this was meant to express good-will than they
shook hands with us all round.&nbsp; After this ceremony was gone
through Jack went up to the girl, who had never once moved from 
the rock where she had been left, but had continued an eager 
spectator of all that had passed.&nbsp; He made signs to her to 
follow him and then, taking the chief by the hand, was about to 
conduct him to the bower when his eye fell on the poor infant 
which had been thrown into the sea and was still lying on the 
shore.&nbsp; Dropping the chief&rsquo;s hand he hastened towards 
it, and, to his great joy, found it to be still alive.&nbsp; We 
also found that the mother was beginning to recover slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, get out o&rsquo; the way,&rdquo; said Jack, 
pushing us aside, as we stooped over the poor woman and 
endeavoured to restore her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soon bring her 
round.&rdquo;&nbsp; So saying, he placed the infant on her bosom 
and laid its warm cheek on hers.&nbsp; The effect was 
wonderful.&nbsp; The woman opened her eyes, felt the child, 
looked at it, and with a cry of joy clasped it in her arms, at 
the same time endeavouring to rise, for the purpose, apparently, 
of rushing into the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Jack, once 
more taking the chief by the hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now Ralph and 
Peterkin, make the women and these fellows follow me to the 
bower.&nbsp; Well entertain them as hospitably as we 
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a few minutes the savages were all seated on the ground in 
front of the bower making a hearty meal off a cold roast pig, 
several ducks, and a variety of cold fish, together with an 
unlimited supply of cocoa-nuts, bread-fruits, yams, taro, and 
plums; with all of which they seemed to be quite familiar and 
perfectly satisfied.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we three being thoroughly knocked up with our 
day&rsquo;s work, took a good draught of cocoa-nut lemonade, and 
throwing ourselves on our beds fell fast asleep.&nbsp; The 
savages it seems followed our example, and in half-an-hour the 
whole camp was buried in repose.</p>
<p>How long we slept I cannot tell, but this I know, that when we
lay down the sun was setting and when we awoke it was high in the
heavens.&nbsp; I awoke Jack, who started up in surprise, being 
unable at first to comprehend our situation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, 
then,&rdquo; said he, springing up, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s see after 
breakfast.&nbsp; Hallo!&nbsp; Peterkin, lazy fellow, how long do 
you mean to lie there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peterkin yawned heavily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said he, 
opening his eyes and looking up after some trouble, &ldquo;if it 
isn&rsquo;t to-morrow morning, and me thinking it was to-day all 
this time.&nbsp; Hallo!&nbsp; Venus, where did you come from? you
seem tolerably at home, any how.&nbsp; Bah! might as well speak 
to the cat as to you&mdash;better, in fact, for it understands 
me, and you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This remark was called forth by the sight of one of the 
elderly females, who had seated herself on the rock in front of 
the bower, and, having placed her child at her feet, was busily 
engaged in devouring the remains of a roast pig.</p>
<p>By this time the natives outside were all astir, and breakfast
in an advanced state of preparation.&nbsp; During the course of 
it we made sundry attempts to converse with the natives by signs,
but without effect.&nbsp; At last we hit upon a plan of 
discovering their names.&nbsp; Jack pointed to his breast and add
&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; very distinctly; then he pointed to Peterkin 
and to me, repeating our names at the same time.&nbsp; Then he 
pointed to himself again, and said &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; and laying
his finger on the breast of the chief, looked inquiringly into 
his face.&nbsp; The chief instantly understood him and said 
&ldquo;Tararo,&rdquo; twice, distinctly.&nbsp; Jack repeated it 
after him, and the chief, nodding his head approvingly, said 
&ldquo;Chuck.&rdquo;&nbsp; On hearing which, Peterkin exploded 
with laughter; but Jack turned and with a frown rebuked him, 
saying, &ldquo;I must look even more indignantly at you than I 
feel, Peterkin, you rascal, for these fellows don&rsquo;t like to
be laughed at.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then turning towards the youngest of 
the women, who was seated at the door of the bower, he pointed to
her; whereupon the chief said, &ldquo;Avatea;&rdquo; and pointing
towards the sun, raised his finger slowly towards the zenith, 
where it remained steadily for a minute or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can that mean, I wonder,&rdquo; said Jack, looking
puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Peterkin, &ldquo;the chief means 
she is an angel come down to stay here for a while.&nbsp; If so, 
she&rsquo;s an uncommonly black one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We did not feel quite satisfied with this explanation, so Jack
went up to her and said, &ldquo;Avatea.&rdquo;&nbsp; The woman 
smiled sadly, and nodded her head, at the same time pointing to 
her breast and then to the sun, in the same manner as the chief 
had done.&nbsp; We were much puzzled to know what this could 
signify, but as there was no way of solving our difficulty we 
were obliged to rest content.</p>
<p>Jack now made signs to the natives to follow him, and, taking 
up his axe, he led them to the place where the battle had been 
fought.&nbsp; Here we found the prisoners, who had passed the 
night on the beach having been totally forgotten by us, as our 
minds had been full of our guests, and were ultimately overcome 
by sleep.&nbsp; They did not seem the worse for their exposure, 
however, as we judged by the hearty appetite with which they 
devoured the breakfast that was soon after given to them.&nbsp; 
Jack then began to dig a hole in the sand, and, after working a 
few seconds, he pointed to it and to the dead bodies that lay 
exposed on the beach.&nbsp; The natives immediately perceived 
what he wanted, and, running for their paddles, dug a hole in the
course of half an hour that was quite large enough to contain all
the bodies of the slain.&nbsp; When it was finished they tossed 
their dead enemies into it with so much indifference that we felt
assured they would not have put themselves to this trouble had we
not asked them to do so.&nbsp; The body of the yellow-haired 
chief was the last thrown in.&nbsp; This wretched man would have 
recovered from the blow with which Jack felled him, and, indeed, 
he did endeavour to rise during the melee that followed his fall,
but one of his enemies, happening to notice the action, dealt him
a blow with his club that killed him on the spot.</p>
<p>While they were about to throw the sand over this chief, one 
of the savages stooped over him, and with a knife, made 
apparently of stone, cut a large slice of flesh from his 
thigh.&nbsp; We knew at once that he intended to make use of this
for food, and could not repress a cry of horror and disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, you blackguard,&rdquo; cried Jack, starting
up and seizing the man by the arm, &ldquo;pitch that into the 
hole.&nbsp; Do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The savage of course did not understand the command, but he 
perfectly understood the look of disgust with which Jack regarded
the flesh, and his fierce gaze as he pointed towards the 
hole.&nbsp; Nevertheless he did not obey.&nbsp; Jack instantly 
turned to Tararo and made signs to him to enforce 
obedience.&nbsp; The chief seemed to understand the appeal, for 
he stepped forward, raised his club, and was on the point of 
dashing out the brains of his offending subject, when Jack sprang
forward and caught his uplifted arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;you blockhead, I 
don&rsquo;t want you to kill the man.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then 
pointed again to the flesh and to the hole.&nbsp; The chief 
uttered a few words, which had the desired effect; for the man 
threw the flesh into the hole, which was immediately filled 
up.&nbsp; This man was of a morose, sulky disposition, and, 
during all the time he remained on the island, regarded us, 
especially Jack, with a scowling visage.&nbsp; His name, we 
found, was Mahine.</p>
<p>The next three or four days were spent by the savages in 
mending their canoe, which had been damaged by the violent shock 
it had sustained on striking the shore.&nbsp; This canoe was a 
very curious structure.&nbsp; It was about thirty feet long, and 
had a high towering stern.&nbsp; The timbers, of which it was 
partly composed, were fastened much in the same way as those of 
our little boat were put together; but the part that seemed most 
curious to us was a sort of out-rigger, or long plank, which was 
attached to the body of the canoe by means of two stout cross 
beams.&nbsp; These beams kept the plank parallel with the canoe, 
but not in contact with it, for it floated in the water with an 
open space between; thus forming a sort of double canoe.&nbsp; 
This we found was intended to prevent the upsetting of the canoe,
which was so narrow that it could not have maintained an upright 
position without the out-rigger.&nbsp; We could not help 
wondering both at the ingenuity and the clumsiness of this 
contrivance.</p>
<p>When the canoe was ready, we assisted the natives to carry the
prisoners into it, and helped them to load it with provisions and
fruit.&nbsp; Peterkin also went to the plum-tree for the purpose 
of making a special onslaught upon the hogs, and killed no less 
than six of them.&nbsp; These we baked and presented to our 
friends on the day of their departure.&nbsp; On that day Tararo 
made a great many energetic signs to us, which, after much 
consideration, we came to understand were proposals that we 
should go away with him to his island; but, having no desire to 
do so, we shook our heads very decidedly.&nbsp; However, we 
consoled him by presenting him with our rusty axe, which we 
thought we could spare, having the excellent one which had been 
so providentially washed ashore to us the day we were 
wrecked.&nbsp; We also gave him a piece of wood with our names 
carved on it, and a piece of string to hang it round his neck as 
an ornament.</p>
<p>In a few minutes more we were all assembled on the 
beach.&nbsp; Being unable to speak to the savages, we went 
through the ceremony of shaking hands, and expected they would 
depart; but, before doing so, Tararo went up to Jack and rubbed 
noses with him, after which he did the same with Peterkin and 
me!&nbsp; Seeing that this was their mode of salutation, we 
determined to conform to their custom, so we rubbed noses 
heartily with the whole party, women and all!&nbsp; The only 
disagreeable part of the process was, when we came to rub noses 
with Mahine, and Peterkin afterwards said, that when he saw his 
wolfish eyes glaring so close to his face, he felt much more 
inclined to <i>bang</i> than to <i>rub</i> his nose.&nbsp; Avatea
was the last to take leave of us, and we experienced a feeling of
real sorrow when she approached to bid us farewell.&nbsp; Besides
her modest air and gentle manners she was the only one of the 
party who exhibited the smallest sign of regret at parting from 
us.&nbsp; Going up to Jack, she put out her flat little nose to 
be rubbed, and thereafter paid the same compliment to Peterkin 
and me.</p>
<p>An hour later the canoe was out of sight, and we, with an 
indefinable feeling of sadness creeping round our hearts, were 
seated in silence beneath the shadow of our bower, meditating on 
the wonderful events of the last few days.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<p>Sagacious and moral remarks in regard to life&mdash;A 
sail!&mdash;An unexpected salute&mdash;The end of the black 
cat&mdash;A terrible dive&mdash;An incautious proceeding and a 
frightful catastrophe.</p>
<p>Life is a strange compound.&nbsp; Peterkin used to say of it, 
that it beat a druggist&rsquo;s shop all to sticks; for, whereas 
the first is a compound of good and bad, the other is a horrible 
compound of all that is utterly detestable.&nbsp; And indeed the 
more I consider it the more I am struck with the strange mixture 
of good and evil that exists not only in the material earth but 
in our own natures.&nbsp; In our own Coral Island we had 
experienced every variety of good that a bountiful Creator could 
heap on us.&nbsp; Yet on the night of the storm we had seen how 
almost, in our case,&mdash;and altogether, no doubt, in the case 
of others less fortunate&mdash;all this good might be swept away 
for ever.&nbsp; We had seen the rich fruit-trees waving in the 
soft air, the tender herbs shooting upwards under the benign 
influence of the bright sun; and, the next day, we had seen these
good and beautiful trees and plants uprooted by the hurricane, 
crushed and hurled to the ground in destructive 
devastation.&nbsp; We had lived for many months in a clime for 
the most part so beautiful, that we had often wondered whether 
Adam and Eve had found Eden more sweet; and we had seen the quiet
solitudes of our paradise suddenly broken in upon by ferocious 
savages, and the white sands stained with blood and strewed with 
lifeless forms; yet, among these cannibals, we had seen many 
symptoms of a kindly nature.&nbsp; I pondered these things much, 
and, while I considered them, there recurred to my memory those 
words which I had read in my Bible,&mdash;the works of God are 
wonderful, and his ways past finding out.</p>
<p>After these poor savages had left us, we used to hold long and
frequent conversations about them, and I noticed that 
Peterkin&rsquo;s manner was now much altered.&nbsp; He did not, 
indeed, jest less heartily than before, but he did so less 
frequently, and often there was a tone of deep seriousness in his
manner, if not in his words, which made him seem to Jack and me 
as if he had grown two years older within a few days.&nbsp; But 
indeed I was not surprised at this, when I reflected on the awful
realities which we had witnessed so lately.&nbsp; We could by no 
means shake off a tendency to gloom for several weeks afterwards;
but, as time wore away, our usual good spirits returned somewhat,
and we began to think of the visit of the savages with feelings 
akin to those with which we recall a terrible dream.</p>
<p>One day we were all enjoying ourselves in the Water Garden, 
preparatory to going on a fishing excursion; for Peterkin had 
kept us in such constant supply of hogs that we had become quite 
tired of pork, and desired a change.&nbsp; Peterkin was sunning 
himself on the ledge of rock, while we were creeping among the 
rocks below.&nbsp; Happening to look up, I observed Peterkin 
cutting the most extraordinary capers and making violent 
gesticulations for us to come up; so I gave Jack a push, and rose
immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sail! a sail!&nbsp; Ralph, look!&nbsp; Jack, away on 
the horizon there, just over the entrance to the lagoon!&rdquo; 
cried Peterkin, as we scrambled up the rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is, and a schooner, too!&rdquo; said Jack, as he 
proceeded hastily to dress.</p>
<p>Our hearts were thrown into a terrible flutter by this 
discovery, for if it should touch at our island we had no doubt 
the captain would be happy to give us a passage to some of the 
civilized islands, where we could find a ship sailing for 
England, or some other part of Europe.&nbsp; Home, with all its 
associations, rushed in upon my heart like a flood, and, much 
though I loved the Coral Island and the bower which had now been 
our home so long, I felt that I could have quitted all at that 
moment without a sigh.&nbsp; With joyful anticipations we 
hastened to the highest point of rock near our dwelling, and 
awaited the arrival of the vessel, for we now perceived that she 
was making straight for the island, under a steady breeze.</p>
<p>In less than an hour she was close to the reef, where she 
rounded to, and backed her topsails in order to survey the 
coast.&nbsp; Seeing this, and fearing that they might not 
perceive us, we all three waved pieces of cocoa-nut cloth in the 
air, and soon had the satisfaction of seeing them beginning to 
lower a boat and bustle about the decks as if they meant to 
land.&nbsp; Suddenly a flag was run up to the peak, a little 
cloud of white smoke rose from the schooner&rsquo;s side, and, 
before we could guess their intentions, a cannon-shot came 
crashing through the bushes, carried away several cocoa-nut trees
in its passage, and burst in atoms against the cliff a few yards 
below the spot on which we stood.</p>
<p>With feelings of terror we now observed that the flag at the 
schooner&rsquo;s peak was black, with a Death&rsquo;s head and 
cross bones upon it.&nbsp; As we gazed at each other in blank 
amazement, the word &ldquo;pirate&rdquo; escaped our lips 
simultaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo; cried Peterkin, as we 
observed a boat shoot from the vessel&rsquo;s side, and make for 
the entrance of the reef.&nbsp; &ldquo;If they take us off the 
island, it will either be to throw us overboard for sport, or to 
make pirates of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not reply, but looked at Jack, as being our only 
resource in this emergency.&nbsp; He stood with folded arms, and 
his eyes fixed with a grave, anxious expression on the 
ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is but one hope,&rdquo; said he, 
turning with a sad expression of countenance to Peterkin; 
&ldquo;perhaps, after all, we may not have to resort to it.&nbsp;
If these villains are anxious to take us, they will soon overrun 
the whole island.&nbsp; But come, follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stopping abruptly in his speech, Jack bounded into the woods, 
and led us by a circuitous route to Spouting Cliff.&nbsp; Here he
halted, and, advancing cautiously to the rocks, glanced over 
their edge.&nbsp; We were soon by his side, and saw the boat, 
which was crowded with armed men, just touching the shore.&nbsp; 
In an instant the crew landed, formed line, and rushed up to our 
bower.</p>
<p>In a few seconds we saw them hurrying back to the boat, one of
them swinging the poor cat round his head by the tail.&nbsp; On 
reaching the water&rsquo;s edge, he tossed it far into the sea, 
and joined his companions, who appeared to be holding a hasty 
council.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see what we may expect,&rdquo; said Jack 
bitterly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The man who will wantonly kill a poor 
brute for sport will think little of murdering a 
fellow-creature.&nbsp; Now, boys, we have but one chance 
left,&mdash;the Diamond Cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Diamond Cave!&rdquo; cried Peterkin, &ldquo;then my
chance is a poor one, for I could not dive into it if all the 
pirates on the Pacific were at my heels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, but,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we will take you down, 
Peterkin, if you will only trust us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I spoke, we observed the pirates scatter over the beach, 
and radiate, as if from a centre, towards the woods and along 
shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Peterkin,&rdquo; said Jack, in a solemn tone, 
&ldquo;you must make up your mind to do it, or we must make up 
our minds to die in your company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack, my dear friend,&rdquo; cried Peterkin, 
turning pale, &ldquo;leave me; I don&rsquo;t believe 
they&rsquo;ll think it worth while to kill me.&nbsp; Go, you and 
Ralph, and dive into the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will not I,&rdquo; answered Jack quietly, while he
picked up a stout cudgel from the ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;So now, 
Ralph, we must prepare to meet these fellows.&nbsp; Their motto 
is, &lsquo;No quarter.&rsquo;&nbsp; If we can manage to floor 
those coming in this direction, we may escape into the woods for 
a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are five of them,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;we have 
no chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, then,&rdquo; cried Peterkin, starting up, and 
grasping Jack convulsively by the arm, &ldquo;let us dive; I will
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who are not naturally expert in the water know well the 
feelings of horror that overwhelm them, when in it, at the bare 
idea of being held down, even for a few seconds,&mdash;that 
spasmodic, involuntary recoil from compulsory immersion which has
no connection whatever with cowardice; and they will understand 
the amount of resolution that it required in Peterkin to allow 
himself to be dragged down to a depth of ten feet, and then, 
through a narrow tunnel, into an almost pitch-dark cavern.&nbsp; 
But there was no alternative.&nbsp; The pirates had already 
caught sight of us, and were now within a short distance of the 
rocks.</p>
<p>Jack and I seized Peterkin by the arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, keep quite still, no struggling,&rdquo; said Jack,
&ldquo;or we are lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peterkin made no reply, but the stern gravity of his marble 
features, and the tension of his muscles, satisfied us that he 
had fully made up his mind to go through with it.&nbsp; Just as 
the pirates gained the foot of the rocks, which hid us for a 
moment from their view, we bent over the sea, and plunged down 
together head foremost.&nbsp; Peterkin behaved like a hero.&nbsp;
He floated passively between us like a log of wood, and we passed
the tunnel and rose into the cave in a shorter space of time than
I had ever done it before.</p>
<p>Peterkin drew a long, deep breath on reaching the surface; and
in a few seconds we were all standing on the ledge of rock in 
safety.&nbsp; Jack now searched for the tinder and torch, which 
always lay in the cave.&nbsp; He soon found them, and, lighting 
the torch, revealed to Peterkin&rsquo;s wondering gaze the 
marvels of the place.&nbsp; But we were too wet to waste much 
time in looking about us.&nbsp; Our first care was to take off 
our clothes, and wring them as dry as we could.&nbsp; This done, 
we proceeded to examine into the state of our larder, for, as 
Jack truly remarked, there was no knowing how long the pirates 
might remain on the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Peterkin, &ldquo;they may take it 
into their heads to stop here altogether, and so we shall be 
buried alive in this place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, Peterkin, that it&rsquo;s the 
nearest thing to being drowned alive that you ever felt?&rdquo; 
said Jack with a smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve no fear of 
that.&nbsp; These villains never stay long on shore.&nbsp; The 
sea is their home, so you may depend upon it that they 
won&rsquo;t stay more than a day or two at the 
furthest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now began to make arrangements for spending the night in 
the cavern.&nbsp; At various periods Jack and I had conveyed 
cocoa nuts and other fruits, besides rolls of cocoa-nut cloth, to
this submarine cave, partly for amusement, and partly from a 
feeling that we might possibly be driven one day to take shelter 
here from the savages.&nbsp; Little did we imagine that the first
savages who would drive us into it would be white savages, 
perhaps our own countrymen.&nbsp; We found the cocoa-nuts in good
condition, and the cooked yams, but the bread-fruits were 
spoiled.&nbsp; We also found the cloth where we had left it; and,
on opening it out, there proved to be sufficient to make a bed; 
which was important, as the rock was damp.&nbsp; Having collected
it all together, we spread out our bed, placed our torch in the 
midst of us, and ate our supper.&nbsp; It was indeed a strange 
chamber to feast in; and we could not help remarking on the cold,
ghastly appearance of the walls, and the black water at our side,
with the thick darkness beyond, and the sullen sound of the drops
that fell at long intervals from the roof of the cavern into the 
still water; and the strong contrast between all this and our bed
and supper, which, with our faces, were lit up with the deep red 
flame of the torch.</p>
<p>We sat long over our meal, talking together in subdued voices,
for we did not like the dismal echoes that rang through the vault
above when we happened to raise them.&nbsp; At last the faint 
light that came through the opening died away, warning us that it
was night and time for rest.&nbsp; We therefore put out our torch
and lay down to sleep.</p>
<p>On awaking, it was some time ere we could collect our 
faculties so as to remember where we were, and we were in much 
uncertainty as to whether it was early or late.&nbsp; We saw by 
the faint light that it was day, but could not guess at the hour;
so Jack proposed that he should dive out and reconnoitre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jack,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;do you rest here.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ve had enough to do during the last few days.&nbsp; 
Rest yourself now, and take care of Peterkin, while I go out to 
see what the pirates are about.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be very careful 
not to expose myself, and I&rsquo;ll bring you word again in a 
short time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Ralph,&rdquo; answered Jack, &ldquo;please 
yourself, but don&rsquo;t be long; and if you&rsquo;ll take my 
advice you&rsquo;ll go in your clothes, for I would like to have 
some fresh cocoa nuts, and climbing trees without clothes is 
uncomfortable, to say the least of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pirates will be sure to keep a sharp 
lookout,&rdquo; said Peterkin, &ldquo;so, pray, be 
careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; answered my comrades.</p>
<p>And while the words were yet sounding in my ears, I plunged 
into the water, and in a few seconds found myself in the open 
air.&nbsp; On rising, I was careful to come up gently and to 
breathe softly, while I kept close in beside the rocks; but, as I
observed no one near me, I crept slowly out, and ascended the 
cliff a step at a time, till I obtained a full view of the 
shore.&nbsp; No pirates were to be seen,&mdash;even their boat 
was gone; but as it was possible they might have hidden 
themselves, I did not venture too boldly forward.&nbsp; Then it 
occurred to me to look out to sea, when, to my surprise, I saw 
the pirate schooner sailing away almost hull-down on the 
horizon!&nbsp; On seeing this I uttered a shout of joy.&nbsp; 
Then my first impulse was to dive back to tell my companions the 
good news; but I checked myself, and ran to the top of the cliff,
in order to make sure that the vessel I saw was indeed the pirate
schooner.&nbsp; I looked long and anxiously at her, and, giving 
vent to a deep sigh of relief, said aloud, &ldquo;Yes, there she 
goes; the villains have been baulked of their prey this time at 
least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so sure of that!&rdquo; said a deep voice at my 
side; while, at the same moment, a heavy hand grasped my 
shoulder, and held it as if in a vice.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<p>I fall into the hands of pirates&mdash;How they treated me, 
and what I said to them&mdash;The result of the whole ending in a
melancholy separation and in a most unexpected gift.</p>
<p>My heart seemed to leap into my throat at the words; and, 
turning round, I beheld a man of immense stature, and fierce 
aspect regarding me with a smile of contempt.&nbsp; He was a 
white man,&mdash;that is to say, he was a man of European blood, 
though his face, from long exposure to the weather, was deeply 
bronzed.&nbsp; His dress was that of a common seaman, except that
he had on a Greek skull-cap, and wore a broad shawl of the 
richest silk round his waist.&nbsp; In this shawl were placed two
pair of pistols and a heavy cutlass.&nbsp; He wore a beard and 
moustache, which, like the locks on his head, were short, curly, 
and sprinkled with gray hairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, youngster,&rdquo; he said, with a Sardonic smile, 
while I felt his grasp tighten on my shoulder, &ldquo;the 
villains have been baulked of their prey, have they?&nbsp; We 
shall see, we shall see.&nbsp; Now, you whelp, look 
yonder.&rdquo;&nbsp; As he spoke, the pirate uttered a shrill 
whistle.&nbsp; In a second or two it was answered, and the 
pirate-boat rowed round the point at the Water Garden, and came 
rapidly towards us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, go, make a fire on that 
point; and hark&rsquo;ee, youngster, if you try to run away, 
I&rsquo;ll send a quick and sure messenger after you,&rdquo; and 
he pointed significantly at his pistols.</p>
<p>I obeyed in silence, and as I happened to have the 
burning-glass in my pocket, a fire was speedily kindled, and a 
thick smoke ascended into the air.&nbsp; It had scarcely appeared
for two minutes when the boom of a gun rolled over the sea, and, 
looking up, I saw that the schooner was making for the island 
again.&nbsp; It now flashed across me that this was a ruse on the
part of the pirates, and that they had sent their vessel away, 
knowing that it would lead us to suppose that they had left 
altogether.&nbsp; But there was no use of regret now.&nbsp; I was
completely in their power, so I stood helplessly beside the 
pirate watching the crew of the boat as they landed on the 
beach.&nbsp; For an instant I contemplated rushing over the cliff
into the sea, but this I saw I could not now accomplish, as some 
of the men were already between me and the water.</p>
<p>There was a good deal of jesting at the success of their 
scheme, as the crew ascended the rocks and addressed the man who 
had captured me by the title of captain.&nbsp; They were a 
ferocious set of men, with shaggy beards and scowling 
brows.&nbsp; All of them were armed with cutlasses and pistols, 
and their costumes were, with trifling variations, similar to 
that of the captain.&nbsp; As I looked from one to the other, and
observed the low, scowling brows, that never unbent, even when 
the men laughed, and the mean, rascally expression that sat on 
each face, I felt that my life hung by a hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where are the other cubs?&rdquo; cried one of the 
men, with an oath that made me shudder.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll 
swear to it there were three, at least, if not more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear what he says, whelp; where are the other 
dogs?&rdquo; said the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean my companions,&rdquo; said I, in a low 
voice, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A loud laugh burst from the crew at this answer.</p>
<p>The pirate captain looked at me in surprise.&nbsp; Then 
drawing a pistol from his belt, he cocked it and said, 
&ldquo;Now, youngster, listen to me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no time to 
waste here.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t tell me all you know, 
I&rsquo;ll blow your brains out!&nbsp; Where are your 
comrades?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant I hesitated, not knowing what to do in this 
extremity.&nbsp; Suddenly a thought occurred to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Villain,&rdquo; said I, shaking my clenched fist in his
face, &ldquo;to blow my brains out would make short work of me, 
and be soon over.&nbsp; Death by drowning is as sure, and the 
agony prolonged, yet, I tell you to your face, if you were to 
toss me over yonder cliff into the sea, I would not tell you 
where my companions are, and I dare you to try me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pirate captain grew white with rage as I spoke.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Say you so?&rdquo; cried he, uttering a fierce oath.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here, lads, take him by the legs and heave him 
in,&mdash;quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men, who were utterly silenced with surprise at my 
audacity, advanced, and seized me, and, as they carried me 
towards the cliff, I congratulated myself not a little on the 
success of my scheme, for I knew that once in the water I should 
be safe, and could rejoin Jack and Peterkin in the cave.&nbsp; 
But my hopes were suddenly blasted by the captain crying out, 
&ldquo;Hold on, lads, hold on.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll give him a taste
of the thumb-screws before throwing him to the sharks.&nbsp; Away
with him into the boat.&nbsp; Look alive! the breeze is 
freshening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men instantly raised me shoulder high, and, hurrying down 
the rocks, tossed me into the bottom of the boat, where I lay for
some time stunned with the violence of my fall.</p>
<p>On recovering sufficiently to raise myself on my elbow, I 
perceived that we were already outside the coral reef, and close 
alongside the schooner, which was of small size and clipper 
built.&nbsp; I had only time to observe this much, when I 
received a severe kick on the side from one of the men, who 
ordered me, in a rough voice, to jump aboard.&nbsp; Rising 
hastily I clambered up the side.&nbsp; In a few minutes the boat 
was hoisted on deck, the vessel&rsquo;s head put close to the 
wind, and the Coral Island dropped slowly astern as we beat up 
against a head sea.</p>
<p>Immediately after coming aboard, the crew were too busily 
engaged in working the ship and getting in the boat to attend to 
me, so I remained leaning against the bulwarks close to the 
gangway, watching their operations.&nbsp; I was surprised to find
that there were no guns or carronades of any kind in the vessel, 
which had more of the appearance of a fast-sailing trader than a 
pirate.&nbsp; But I was struck with the neatness of 
everything.&nbsp; The brass work of the binnacle and about the 
tiller, as well as the copper belaying-pins, were as brightly 
polished as if they had just come from the foundry.&nbsp; The 
decks were pure white, and smooth.&nbsp; The masts were 
clean-scraped and varnished, except at the cross-trees and truck,
which were painted black.&nbsp; The standing and running rigging 
was in the most perfect order, and the sails white as snow.&nbsp;
In short, everything, from the single narrow red stripe on her 
low black hull to the trucks on her tapering masts, evinced an 
amount of care and strict discipline that would have done credit 
to a ship of the Royal Navy.&nbsp; There was nothing lumbering or
unseemly about the vessel, excepting, perhaps, a boat, which lay 
on the deck with its keel up between the fore and main 
masts.&nbsp; It seemed disproportionately large for the schooner;
but, when I saw that the crew amounted to between thirty and 
forty men, I concluded that this boat was held in reserve, in 
case of any accident compelling the crew to desert the 
vessel.</p>
<p>As I have before said, the costumes of the men were similar to
that of the captain.&nbsp; But in head gear they differed not 
only from him but from each other, some wearing the ordinary 
straw hat of the merchant service, while others wore cloth caps 
and red worsted night-caps.&nbsp; I observed that all their arms 
were sent below; the captain only retaining his cutlass and a 
single pistol in the folds of his shawl.&nbsp; Although the 
captain was the tallest and most powerful man in the ship, he did
not strikingly excel many of his men in this respect, and the 
only difference that an ordinary observer would have noticed was,
a certain degree of open candour, straightforward daring, in the 
bold, ferocious expression of his face, which rendered him less 
repulsive than his low-browed associates, but did not by any 
means induce the belief that he was a hero.&nbsp; This look was, 
however, the indication of that spirit which gave him the 
pre-eminence among the crew of desperadoes who called him 
captain.&nbsp; He was a lion-like villain; totally devoid of 
personal fear, and utterly reckless of consequences, and, 
therefore, a terror to his men, who individually hated him, but 
unitedly felt it to be their advantage to have him at their 
head.</p>
<p>But my thoughts soon reverted to the dear companions whom I 
had left on shore, and as I turned towards the Coral Island, 
which was now far away to leeward, I sighed deeply, and the tears
rolled slowly down my cheeks as I thought that I might never see 
them more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re blubbering, are you, you obstinate 
whelp?&rdquo; said the deep voice of the captain, as he came up 
and gave me a box on the ear that nearly felled me to the 
deck.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t allow any such weakness aboard 
o&rsquo; this ship.&nbsp; So clap a stopper on your eyes or 
I&rsquo;ll give you something to cry for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I flushed with indignation at this rough and cruel treatment, 
but felt that giving way to anger would only make matters worse, 
so I made no reply, but took out my handkerchief and dried my 
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were made of better stuff,&rdquo; 
continued the captain, angrily; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have a 
mad bull-dog aboard than a water-eyed puppy.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll
cure you, lad, or introduce you to the sharks before long.&nbsp; 
Now go below, and stay there till I call you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I walked forward to obey, my eye fell on a small keg 
standing by the side of the main-mast, on which the word 
<i>gunpowder</i> was written in pencil.&nbsp; It immediately 
flashed across me that, as we were beating up against the wind, 
anything floating in the sea would be driven on the reef 
encircling the Coral Island.&nbsp; I also recollected&mdash;for 
thought is more rapid than the lightning&mdash;that my old 
companions had a pistol.&nbsp; Without a moment&rsquo;s 
hesitation, therefore, I lifted the keg from the deck and tossed 
it into the sea!&nbsp; An exclamation of surprise burst from the 
captain and some of the men who witnessed this act of mine.</p>
<p>Striding up to me, and uttering fearful imprecations, the 
captain raised his hand to strike me, while he shouted, 
&ldquo;Boy! whelp! what mean you by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you lower your hand,&rdquo; said I, in a loud voice,
while I felt the blood rush to my temples, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
you.&nbsp; Until you do so I&rsquo;m dumb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain stepped back and regarded me with a look of 
amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued I, &ldquo;I threw that keg into 
the sea because the wind and waves will carry it to my friends on
the Coral Island, who happen to have a pistol, but no 
powder.&nbsp; I hope that it will reach them soon, and my only 
regret is that the keg was not a bigger one.&nbsp; Moreover, 
pirate, you said just now that you thought I was made of better 
stuff!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what stuff I am made of,&mdash;I 
never thought much about that subject; but I&rsquo;m quite 
certain of this, that I am made of such stuff as the like of you 
shall never tame, though you should do your worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To my surprise the captain, instead of flying into a rage, 
smiled, and, thrusting his hand into the voluminous shawl that 
encircled his waist, turned on his heel and walked aft, while I 
went below.</p>
<p>Here, instead of being rudely handled, as I had expected, the 
men received me with a shout of laughter, and one of them, 
patting me on the back, said, &ldquo;Well done, lad! you&rsquo;re
a brick, and I have no doubt will turn out a rare cove.&nbsp; 
Bloody Bill, there, was just such a fellow as you are, and 
he&rsquo;s now the biggest cut-throat of us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a can of beer, lad,&rdquo; cried another, 
&ldquo;and wet your whistle after that speech o&rsquo; 
your&rsquo;n to the captain.&nbsp; If any one o&rsquo; us had 
made it, youngster, he would have had no whistle to wet by this 
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop your clapper, Jack,&rdquo; vociferated a third; 
&ldquo;give the boy a junck o&rsquo; meat.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you 
see he&rsquo;s a&rsquo;most goin&rsquo; to kick the 
bucket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no wonder,&rdquo; said the first speaker, with an 
oath, &ldquo;after the tumble you gave him into the boat.&nbsp; I
guess it would have broke <i>your</i> neck if you had got 
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did indeed feel somewhat faint; which was owing, doubtless, 
to the combined effects of ill-usage and hunger; for it will be 
recollected that I had dived out of the cave that morning before 
breakfast, and it was now near mid-day.&nbsp; I therefore gladly 
accepted a plate of boiled pork and a yam, which were handed to 
me by one of the men from the locker on which some of the crew 
were seated eating their dinner.&nbsp; But I must add that the 
zest with which I ate my meal was much abated in consequence of 
the frightful oaths and the terrible language that flowed from 
the lips of these godless men, even in the midst of their 
hilarity and good-humour.&nbsp; The man who had been alluded to 
as Bloody Bill was seated near me, and I could not help wondering
at the moody silence he maintained among his comrades.&nbsp; He 
did indeed reply to their questions in a careless, off-hand tone,
but he never volunteered a remark.&nbsp; The only difference 
between him and the others was his taciturnity and his size, for 
he was nearly, if not quite, as large a man as the captain.</p>
<p>During the remainder of the afternoon I was left to my own 
reflections, which were anything but agreeable, for I could not 
banish from my mind the threat about the thumb-screws, of the 
nature and use of which I had a vague but terrible 
conception.&nbsp; I was still meditating on my unhappy fate when,
just after night-fall, one of the watch on deck called down the 
hatchway,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo there! one o&rsquo; you, tumble up and light the 
cabin lamp, and send that boy aft to the 
captain&mdash;sharp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, do you hear, youngster? the captain wants 
you.&nbsp; Look alive,&rdquo; said Bloody Bill, raising his huge 
frame from the locker on which he had been asleep for the last 
two hours.&nbsp; He sprang up the ladder and I instantly followed
him, and, going aft, was shown into the cabin by one of the men, 
who closed the door after me.</p>
<p>A small silver lamp which hung from a beam threw a dim soft 
light over the cabin, which was a small apartment, and 
comfortably but plainly finished.&nbsp; Seated on a camp-stool at
the table, and busily engaged in examining a chart of the 
Pacific, was the captain, who looked up as I entered, and, in a 
quiet voice, bade me be seated, while he threw down his pencil, 
and, rising from the table, stretched himself on a sofa at the 
upper end of the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; said he, looking me full in the face, 
&ldquo;what is your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph Rover,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you come from, and how came you to be on that
island?&nbsp; How many companions had you on it?&nbsp; Answer me,
now, and mind you tell no lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never tell lies,&rdquo; said I, firmly.</p>
<p>The captain received this reply with a cold sarcastic smile, 
and bade me answer his questions.</p>
<p>I then told him the history of myself and my companions from 
the time we sailed till the day of his visit to the island, 
taking care, however, to make no mention of the Diamond 
Cave.&nbsp; After I had concluded, he was silent for a few 
minutes; then, looking up, he said&mdash;&ldquo;Boy, I believe 
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was surprised at this remark, for I could not imagine why he
should not believe me.&nbsp; However, I made no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what,&rdquo; continued the captain, &ldquo;makes 
you think that this schooner is a pirate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The black flag,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;showed me what 
you are; and if any further proof were wanting I have had it in 
the brutal treatment I have received at your hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain frowned as I spoke, but subduing his anger he 
continued&mdash;&ldquo;Boy, you are too bold.&nbsp; I admit that 
we treated you roughly, but that was because you made us lose 
time and gave us a good deal of trouble.&nbsp; As to the black 
flag, that is merely a joke that my fellows play off upon people 
sometimes in order to frighten them.&nbsp; It is their humour, 
and does no harm.&nbsp; I am no pirate, boy, but a lawful 
trader,&mdash;a rough one, I grant you, but one can&rsquo;t help 
that in these seas, where there are so many pirates on the water 
and such murderous blackguards on the land.&nbsp; I carry on a 
trade in sandal-wood with the Feejee Islands; and if you choose, 
Ralph, to behave yourself and be a good boy, I&rsquo;ll take you 
along with me and give you a good share of the profits.&nbsp; You
see I&rsquo;m in want of an honest boy like you, to look after 
the cabin and keep the log, and superintend the traffic on shore 
sometimes.&nbsp; What say you, Ralph, would you like to become a 
sandal-wood trader?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was much surprised by this explanation, and a good deal 
relieved to find that the vessel, after all, was not a pirate; 
but instead of replying I said, &ldquo;If it be as you state, 
then why did you take me from my island, and why do you not now 
take me back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain smiled as he replied, &ldquo;I took you off in 
anger, boy, and I&rsquo;m sorry for it.&nbsp; I would even now 
take you back, but we are too far away from it.&nbsp; See, there 
it is,&rdquo; he added, laying his finger on the chart, 
&ldquo;and we are now here,&mdash;fifty miles at least.&nbsp; It 
would not be fair to my men to put about now, for they have all 
an interest in the trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could make no reply to this; so, after a little more 
conversation, I agreed to become one of the crew, at least until 
we could reach some civilized island where I might be put 
ashore.&nbsp; The captain assented to this proposition, and after
thanking him for the promise, I left the cabin and went on deck 
with feelings that ought to have been lighter, but which were, I 
could not tell why, marvellously heavy and uncomfortable 
still.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<p>Bloody Bill&mdash;Dark surmises&mdash;A strange sail, and a 
strange crew, and a still stranger cargo&mdash;New reasons for 
favouring missionaries&mdash;A murderous massacre, and thoughts 
thereon.</p>
<p>Three weeks after the conversation narrated in the last 
chapter, I was standing on the quarter-deck of the schooner 
watching the gambols of a shoal of porpoises that swam round 
us.&nbsp; It was a dead calm.&nbsp; One of those still, hot, 
sweltering days, so common in the Pacific, when Nature seems to 
have gone to sleep, and the only thing in water or in air that 
proves her still alive, is her long, deep breathing, in the swell
of the mighty sea.&nbsp; No cloud floated in the deep blue above;
no ripple broke the reflected blue below.&nbsp; The sun shone 
fiercely in the sky, and a ball of fire blazed, with almost equal
power, from out the bosom of the water.&nbsp; So intensely still 
was it, and so perfectly transparent was the surface of the deep,
that had it not been for the long swell already alluded to, we 
might have believed the surrounding universe to be a huge blue 
liquid ball, and our little ship the one solitary material speck 
in all creation, floating in the midst of it.</p>
<p>No sound broke on our ears save the soft puff now and then of 
a porpoise, the slow creak of the masts, as we swayed gently on 
the swell, the patter of the reef-points, and the occasional flap
of the hanging sails.&nbsp; An awning covered the fore and after 
parts of the schooner, under which the men composing the watch on
deck lolled in sleepy indolence, overcome with excessive 
heat.&nbsp; Bloody Bill, as the men invariably called him, was 
standing at the tiller, but his post for the present was a 
sinecure, and he whiled away the time by alternately gazing in 
dreamy abstraction at the compass in the binnacle, and by walking
to the taffrail in order to spit into the sea.&nbsp; In one of 
these turns he came near to where I was standing, and, leaning 
over the side, looked long and earnestly down into the blue 
wave.</p>
<p>This man, although he was always taciturn and often surly, was
the only human being on board with whom I had the slightest 
desire to become better acquainted.&nbsp; The other men, seeing 
that I did not relish their company, and knowing that I was a 
protege of the captain, treated me with total indifference.&nbsp;
Bloody Bill, it is true, did the same; but as this was his 
conduct towards every one else, it was not peculiar in reference 
to me.&nbsp; Once or twice I tried to draw him into conversation,
but he always turned away after a few cold monosyllables.&nbsp; 
As he now leaned over the taffrail close beside me, I said to 
him,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill, why is it that you are so gloomy?&nbsp; Why do 
you never speak to any one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill smiled slightly as he replied, &ldquo;Why, I s&rsquo;pose
it&rsquo;s because I haint got nothin&rsquo; to say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; said I, musingly; 
&ldquo;you look like a man that could think, and such men can 
usually speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they can, youngster,&rdquo; rejoined Bill, somewhat 
sternly; &ldquo;and I could speak too if I had a mind to, but 
what&rsquo;s the use o&rsquo; speakin&rsquo; here!&nbsp; The men 
only open their mouths to curse and swear, an&rsquo; they seem to
find it entertaining; but I don&rsquo;t, so I hold my 
tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Bill, that&rsquo;s true, and I would rather not 
hear you speak at all than hear you speak like the other men; but
<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t swear, Bill, so you might talk to me 
sometimes, I think.&nbsp; Besides, I&rsquo;m weary of spending 
day after day in this way, without a single soul to say a 
pleasant word to.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been used to friendly 
conversation, Bill, and I really would take it kind if you would 
talk with me a little now and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill looked at me in surprise, and I thought I observed a sad 
expression pass across his sun-burnt face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; where have you been used to friendly 
conversation,&rdquo; said Bill, looking down again into the sea; 
&ldquo;not on that Coral Island, I take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said I energetically; &ldquo;I have
spent many of the happiest months in my life on that Coral 
Island;&rdquo; and without waiting to be further questioned, I 
launched out into a glowing account of the happy life that Jack 
and Peterkin and I had spent together, and related minutely every
circumstance that befell us while on the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, boy,&rdquo; said Bill, in a voice so deep that it 
startled me, &ldquo;this is no place for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m of 
little use on board, and I don&rsquo;t like my comrades; but I 
can&rsquo;t help it, and at anyrate I hope to be free again 
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Free?&rdquo; said Bill, looking at me in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, free,&rdquo; returned I; &ldquo;the captain said 
he would put me ashore after this trip was over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>This trip</i>!&nbsp; Hark&rsquo;ee, boy,&rdquo; said
Bill, lowering his voice, &ldquo;what said the captain to you the
day you came aboard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said that he was a trader in sandal-wood and no 
pirate, and told me that if I would join him for this trip he 
would give me a good share of the profits or put me on shore in 
some civilized island if I chose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill&rsquo;s brows lowered savagely as he muttered, &ldquo;Ay,
he said truth when he told you he was a sandal-wood trader, but 
he lied when&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sail ho!&rdquo; shouted the look-out at the 
masthead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, away?&rdquo; cried Bill, springing to the 
tiller; while the men, startled by the sudden cry jumped up and 
gazed round the horizon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the starboard quarter, hull down, sir,&rdquo; 
answered the look-out.</p>
<p>At this moment the captain came on deck, and mounting into the
rigging, surveyed the sail through the glass.&nbsp; Then sweeping
his eye round the horizon he gazed steadily at a particular 
point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take in top-sails,&rdquo; shouted the captain, swinging
himself down on the deck by the main-back stay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take in top-sails,&rdquo; roared the first mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir-r-r,&rdquo; answered the men as they sprang
into the rigging and went aloft like cats.</p>
<p>Instantly all was bustle on board the hitherto quiet 
schooner.&nbsp; The top-sails were taken in and stowed, the men 
stood by the sheets and halyards, and the captain gazed anxiously
at the breeze which was now rushing towards us like a sheet of 
dark blue.&nbsp; In a few seconds it struck us.&nbsp; The 
schooner trembled as if in surprise at the sudden onset, while 
she fell away, then bending gracefully to the wind, as though in 
acknowledgment of her subjection, she cut through the waves with 
her sharp prow like a dolphin, while Bill directed her course 
towards the strange sail.</p>
<p>In half an hour we neared her sufficiently to make out that 
she was a schooner, and, from the clumsy appearance of her masts 
and sails we judged her to be a trader.&nbsp; She evidently did 
not like our appearance, for, the instant the breeze reached her,
she crowded all sail and showed us her stern.&nbsp; As the breeze
had moderated a little our top-sails were again shaken out, and 
it soon became evident,&mdash;despite the proverb, &ldquo;A stern
chase is a long one,&rdquo; that we doubled her speed and would 
overhaul her speedily.&nbsp; When within a mile we hoisted 
British colours, but receiving no acknowledgment, the captain 
ordered a shot to be fired across her bows.&nbsp; In a moment, to
my surprise, a large portion of the bottom of the boat amidships 
was removed, and in the hole thus exposed appeared an immense 
brass gun.&nbsp; It worked on a swivel and was elevated by means 
of machinery.&nbsp; It was quickly loaded and fired.&nbsp; The 
heavy ball struck the water a few yards ahead of the chase, and, 
ricochetting into the air, plunged into the sea a mile beyond 
it.</p>
<p>This produced the desired effect.&nbsp; The strange vessel 
backed her top-sails and hove-to, while we ranged up and lay-to, 
about a hundred yards off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lower the boat,&rdquo; cried the captain.</p>
<p>In a second the boat was lowered and manned by a part of the 
crew, who were all armed with cutlasses and pistols.&nbsp; As the
captain passed me to get into it, he said, &ldquo;jump into the 
stern sheets, Ralph, I may want you.&rdquo;&nbsp; I obeyed, and 
in ten minutes more we were standing on the stranger&rsquo;s 
deck.&nbsp; We were all much surprised at the sight that met our 
eyes.&nbsp; Instead of a crew of such sailors as we were 
accustomed to see, there were only fifteen blacks standing on the
quarter-deck and regarding us with looks of undisguised 
alarm.&nbsp; They were totally unarmed and most of them 
unclothed; one or two, however, wore portions of European 
attire.&nbsp; One had on a pair of duck trousers which were much 
too large for him and stuck out in a most ungainly manner.&nbsp; 
Another wore nothing but the common scanty native garment round 
the loins, and a black beaver hat.&nbsp; But the most ludicrous 
personage of all, and one who seemed to be chief, was a tall 
middle-aged man, of a mild, simple expression of countenance, who
wore a white cotton shirt, a swallow-tailed coat, and a straw 
hat, while his black brawny legs were totally uncovered below the
knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the commander of this ship?&rdquo; 
inquired our captain, stepping up to this individual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I is capin,&rdquo; he answered, taking off his straw 
hat and making a low bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; said our captain, in surprise.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Where do you come from, and where are you bound?&nbsp; 
What cargo have you aboard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We is come,&rdquo; answered the man with the 
swallow-tail, &ldquo;from Aitutaki; we was go for 
Rarotonga.&nbsp; We is native miss&rsquo;nary ship; our name is 
de <i>Olive Branch</i>; an&rsquo; our cargo is two tons 
cocoa-nuts, seventy pigs, twenty cats, and de 
Gosp&rsquo;l.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This announcement was received by the crew of our vessel with 
a shout of laughter, which, however, was peremptorily checked by 
the captain, whose expression instantly changed from one of 
severity to that of frank urbanity as he advanced towards the 
missionary and shook him warmly by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very glad to have fallen in with you,&rdquo; said 
he, &ldquo;and I wish you much success in your missionary 
labours.&nbsp; Pray take me to your cabin, as I wish to converse 
with you privately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The missionary immediately took him by the hand, and as he led
him away I heard him saying, &ldquo;Me most glad to find you 
trader; we t&rsquo;ought you be pirate.&nbsp; You very like one 
&rsquo;bout the masts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What conversation the captain had with this man I never heard,
but he came on deck again in a quarter of an hour, and, shaking 
hands cordially with the missionary, ordered us into our boat and
returned to the schooner, which was immediately put before the 
wind.&nbsp; In a few minutes the <i>Olive Branch</i> was left far
behind us.</p>
<p>That afternoon, as I was down below at dinner, I heard the men
talking about this curious ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;why our captain 
looked so sweet on yon swallow-tailed super-cargo o&rsquo; pigs 
and Gospels.&nbsp; If it had been an ordinary trader, now, he 
would have taken as many o&rsquo; the pigs as he required and 
sent the ship with all on board to the bottom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dick, you must be new to these seas if you 
don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; cried another.&nbsp; &ldquo;The 
captain cares as much for the gospel as you do (an&rsquo; 
that&rsquo;s precious little), but he knows, and everybody knows,
that the only place among the southern islands where a ship can 
put in and get what she wants in comfort, is where the gospel has
been sent to.&nbsp; There are hundreds o&rsquo; islands, at this 
blessed moment, where you might as well jump straight into a 
shark&rsquo;s maw as land without a band o&rsquo; thirty comrades
armed to the teeth to back you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said a man with a deep scar over his right 
eye, &ldquo;Dick&rsquo;s new to the work.&nbsp; But if the 
captain takes us for a cargo o&rsquo; sandal-wood to the Feejees 
he&rsquo;ll get a taste o&rsquo; these black gentry in their 
native condition.&nbsp; For my part I don&rsquo;t know, an&rsquo;
I don&rsquo;t care, what the gospel does to them; but I know that
when any o&rsquo; the islands chance to get it, trade goes all 
smooth an&rsquo; easy; but where they ha&rsquo;nt got it, 
Beelzebub himself could hardly desire better company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you ought to be a good judge,&rdquo; cried 
another, laughing, &ldquo;for you&rsquo;ve never kept any company
but the worst all your life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph Rover!&rdquo; shouted a voice down the 
hatchway.&nbsp; &ldquo;Captain wants you, aft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Springing up the ladder I hastened to the cabin, pondering as 
I went the strange testimony borne by these men to the effect of 
the gospel on savage natures;&mdash;testimony which, as it was 
perfectly disinterested, I had no doubt whatever was strictly 
true.</p>
<p>On coming again on deck I found Bloody Bill at the helm, and 
as we were alone together I tried to draw him into 
conversation.&nbsp; After repeating to him the conversation in 
the forecastle about the missionaries, I said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Bill, is this schooner really a trader in 
sandal-wood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ralph, she is; but she&rsquo;s just as really a 
pirate.&nbsp; The black flag you saw flying at the peak was no 
deception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how can you say she&rsquo;s a trader?&rdquo; asked
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, as to that, she trades when she can&rsquo;t take 
by force, but she takes by force, when she can, in 
preference.&nbsp; Ralph,&rdquo; he added, lowering his voice, 
&ldquo;if you had seen the bloody deeds that I have witnessed 
done on these decks you would not need to ask if we were 
pirates.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ll find it out soon enough.&nbsp; As
for the missionaries, the captain favours them because they are 
useful to him.&nbsp; The South-Sea islanders are such incarnate 
fiends that they are the better of being tamed, and the 
missionaries are the only men who can do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our track after this lay through several clusters of small 
islets, among which we were becalmed more than once.&nbsp; During
this part of our voyage the watch on deck and the look-out at the
mast-head were more than usually vigilant, as we were not only in
danger of being attacked by the natives, who, I learned from the 
captain&rsquo;s remarks, were a bloody and deceitful tribe at 
this group, but we were also exposed to much risk from the 
multitudes of coral reefs that rose up in the channels between 
the islands, some of them just above the surface, others a few 
feet below it.&nbsp; Our precautions against the savages I found 
were indeed necessary.</p>
<p>One day we were becalmed among a group of small islands, most 
of which appeared to be uninhabited.&nbsp; As we were in want of 
fresh water the captain sent the boat ashore to bring off a cask 
or two.&nbsp; But we were mistaken in thinking there were no 
natives; for scarcely had we drawn near to the shore when a band 
of naked blacks rushed out of the bush and assembled on the 
beach, brandishing their clubs and spears in a threatening 
manner.&nbsp; Our men were well armed, but refrained from showing
any signs of hostility, and rowed nearer in order to converse 
with the natives; and I now found that more than one of the crew 
could imperfectly speak dialects of the language peculiar to the 
South Sea islanders.&nbsp; When within forty yards of the shore, 
we ceased rowing, and the first mate stood up to address the 
multitude; but, instead of answering us, they replied with a 
shower of stones, some of which cut the men severely.&nbsp; 
Instantly our muskets were levelled, and a volley was about to be
fired, when the captain hailed us in a loud voice from the 
schooner, which lay not more than five or six hundred yards off 
the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fire,&rdquo; he shouted, angrily.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Pull off to the point ahead of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men looked surprised at this order, and uttered deep 
curses as they prepared to obey, for their wrath was roused and 
they burned for revenge.&nbsp; Three or four of them hesitated, 
and seemed disposed to mutiny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t distress yourselves, lads,&rdquo; said the 
mate, while a bitter smile curled his lip.&nbsp; &ldquo;Obey 
orders.&nbsp; The captain&rsquo;s not the man to take an insult 
tamely.&nbsp; If Long Tom does not speak presently I&rsquo;ll 
give myself to the sharks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men smiled significantly as they pulled from the shore, 
which was now crowded with a dense mass of savages, amounting, 
probably, to five or six hundred.&nbsp; We had not rowed off 
above a couple of hundred yards when a loud roar thundered over 
the sea, and the big brass gun sent a withering shower of grape 
point blank into the midst of the living mass, through which a 
wide lane was cut, while a yell, the like of which I could not 
have imagined, burst from the miserable survivors as they fled to
the woods.&nbsp; Amongst the heaps of dead that lay on the sand, 
just where they had fallen, I could distinguish mutilated forms 
writhing in agony, while ever and anon one and another rose 
convulsively from out the mass, endeavoured to stagger towards 
the wood, and ere they had taken a few steps, fell and wallowed 
on the bloody sand.&nbsp; My blood curdled within me as I 
witnessed this frightful and wanton slaughter; but I had little 
time to think, for the captain&rsquo;s deep voice came again over
the water towards us: &ldquo;Pull ashore, lads, and fill your 
water casks.&rdquo;&nbsp; The men obeyed in silence, and it 
seemed to me as if even their hard hearts were shocked by the 
ruthless deed.&nbsp; On gaining the mouth of the rivulet at which
we intended to take in water, we found it flowing with blood, for
the greater part of those who were slain had been standing on the
banks of the stream, a short way above its mouth.&nbsp; Many of 
the wretched creatures had fallen into it, and we found one body,
which had been carried down, jammed between two rocks, with the 
staring eyeballs turned towards us and his black hair waving in 
the ripples of the blood-red stream.&nbsp; No one dared to oppose
our landing now, so we carried our casks to a pool above the 
murdered group, and having filled them, returned on board.&nbsp; 
Fortunately a breeze sprang up soon afterwards and carried us 
away from the dreadful spot; but it could not waft me away from 
the memory of what I had seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this,&rdquo; thought I, gazing in horror at the 
captain, who, with a quiet look of indifference, leaned upon the 
taffrail smoking a cigar and contemplating the fertile green 
islets as they passed like a lovely picture before our 
eyes&mdash;&ldquo;this is the man who favours the missionaries 
because they are useful to him and can tame the savages better 
than any one else can do it!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then I wondered in my 
mind whether it were possible for any missionary to tame 
<i>him</i>!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<p>Bloody Bill is communicative and sagacious&mdash;Unpleasant 
prospects&mdash;Retrospective meditations interrupted by volcanic
agency&mdash;The pirates negotiate with a Feejee 
chief&mdash;Various etceteras that are calculated to surprise and
horrify.</p>
<p>It was many days after the events just narrated ere I 
recovered a little of my wonted spirits.&nbsp; I could not shake 
off the feeling for a long time that I was in a frightful dream, 
and the sight of our captain filled me with so much horror that I
kept out of his way as much as my duties about the cabin would 
permit.&nbsp; Fortunately he took so little notice of me that he 
did not observe my changed feelings towards him, otherwise it 
might have been worse for me.</p>
<p>But I was now resolved that I would run away the very first 
island we should land at, and commit myself to the hospitality of
the natives rather than remain an hour longer than I could help 
in the pirate schooner.&nbsp; I pondered this subject a good 
deal, and at last made up my mind to communicate my intention to 
Bloody Bill; for, during several talks I had had with him of 
late, I felt assured that he too would willingly escape if 
possible.&nbsp; When I told him of my design he shook his 
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no, Ralph,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you must
not think of running away here.&nbsp; Among some of the groups of
islands you might do so with safety, but if you tried it here you
would find that you had jumped out of the fryin&rsquo; pan into 
the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so, Bill?&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;would the natives 
not receive me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That they would, lad; but they would eat you 
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat me!&rdquo; said I in surprise, &ldquo;I thought the
South Sea islanders never ate anybody except their 
enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; ejaculated Bill.&nbsp; &ldquo;I 
s&rsquo;pose &rsquo;twas yer tender-hearted friends in England 
that put that notion into your head.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a set 
o&rsquo; soft-hearted folk at home that I knows on, who 
don&rsquo;t like to have their feelin&rsquo;s ruffled, and when 
you tell them anything they don&rsquo;t like&mdash;that shocks 
them, as they call it&mdash;no matter how true it be, they stop 
their ears and cry out, &lsquo;Oh, that is <i>too</i> 
horrible!&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t believe that!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
An&rsquo; they say truth.&nbsp; They can&rsquo;t believe it 
&rsquo;cause they won&rsquo;t believe it.&nbsp; Now, I believe 
there&rsquo;s thousands o&rsquo; the people in England who are 
sich born drivellin&rsquo; <i>won&rsquo;t-believers</i> that they
think the black fellows hereaway, at the worst, eat an enemy only
now an&rsquo; then, out o&rsquo; spite; whereas, I know for 
certain, and many captains of the British and American navies 
know as well as me, that the Feejee islanders eat not only their 
enemies but one another; and they do it not for spite, but for 
pleasure.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a <i>fact</i> that they prefer human 
flesh to any other.&nbsp; But they don&rsquo;t like white 
men&rsquo;s flesh so well as black.&nbsp; They say it makes them 
sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Bill,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you told me just now 
that they would eat <i>me</i> if they caught me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I did; and so I think they would.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve 
only heard some o&rsquo; them say they don&rsquo;t like white men
<i>so well</i> as black; but if they was hungry they 
wouldn&rsquo;t be particular.&nbsp; Anyhow, I&rsquo;m sure they 
would kill you.&nbsp; You see, Ralph, I&rsquo;ve been a good 
while in them parts, and I&rsquo;ve visited the different groups 
of islands oftentimes as a trader.&nbsp; And thorough goin&rsquo;
blackguards some o&rsquo; them traders are.&nbsp; No better than 
pirates, I can tell you.&nbsp; One captain that I sailed with was
not a chip better than the one we&rsquo;re with now.&nbsp; He was
tradin&rsquo; with a friendly chief one day, aboard his 
vessel.&nbsp; The chief had swam off to us with the things for 
trade tied a-top of his head, for them chaps are like otters in 
the water.&nbsp; Well, the chief was hard on the captain, and 
would not part with some o&rsquo; his things.&nbsp; When their 
bargainin&rsquo; was over they shook hands, and the chief jumped 
over board to swim ashore; but before he got forty yards from the
ship the captain seized a musket and shot him dead.&nbsp; He then
hove up anchor and put to sea, and as we sailed along shore, he 
dropped six black-fellows with his rifle, remarkin&rsquo; that 
&lsquo;that would spoil the trade for the next 
comers.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, as I was sayin&rsquo;, I&rsquo;m up to 
the ways o&rsquo; these fellows.&nbsp; One o&rsquo; the laws 
o&rsquo; the country is, that every shipwrecked person who 
happens to be cast ashore, be he dead or alive, is doomed to be 
roasted and eaten.&nbsp; There was a small tradin&rsquo; schooner
wrecked off one of these islands when we were lyin&rsquo; there 
in harbour during a storm.&nbsp; The crew was lost, all but three
men, who swam ashore.&nbsp; The moment they landed they were 
seized by the natives and carried up into the woods.&nbsp; We 
knew pretty well what their fate would be, but we could not help 
them, for our crew was small, and if we had gone ashore they 
would likely have killed us all.&nbsp; We never saw the three men
again; but we heard frightful yelling, and dancing, and 
merry-making that night; and one of the natives, who came aboard 
to trade with us next day, told us that the <i>long pigs</i>, as 
he called the men, had been roasted and eaten, and their bones 
were to be converted into sail needles.&nbsp; He also said that 
white men were bad to eat, and that most o&rsquo; the people on 
shore were sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was very much shocked and cast down in my mind at this 
terrible account of the natives, and asked Bill what he would 
advise me to do.&nbsp; Looking round the deck to make sure that 
we were not overheard, he lowered his voice and said, 
&ldquo;There are two or three ways that we might escape, Ralph, 
but none o&rsquo; them&rsquo;s easy.&nbsp; If the captain would 
only sail for some o&rsquo; the islands near Tahiti, we might run
away there well enough, because the natives are all Christians; 
an&rsquo; we find that wherever the savages take up with 
Christianity they always give over their bloody ways, and are 
safe to be trusted.&nbsp; I never cared for Christianity 
myself,&rdquo; he continued, in a soliloquising voice, &ldquo;and
I don&rsquo;t well know what it means; but a man with half an eye
can see what it does for these black critters.&nbsp; However, the
captain always keeps a sharp look out after us when we get to 
these islands, for he half suspects that one or two o&rsquo; us 
are tired of his company.&nbsp; Then, we might manage to cut the 
boat adrift some fine night when it&rsquo;s our watch on deck, 
and clear off before they discovered that we were gone.&nbsp; But
we would run the risk o&rsquo; bein&rsquo; caught by the 
blacks.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t like to try that plan.&nbsp; But 
you and I will think over it, Ralph, and see what&rsquo;s to be 
done.&nbsp; In the meantime it&rsquo;s our watch below, so 
I&rsquo;ll go and turn in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill then bade me good night, and went below, while a comrade 
took his place at the helm; but, feeling no desire to enter into 
conversation with him, I walked aft, and, leaning over the stern,
looked down into the phosphorescent waves that gargled around the
ladder, and streamed out like a flame of blue light in the 
vessel&rsquo;s wake.&nbsp; My thoughts were very sad, and I could
scarce refrain from tears as I contrasted my present wretched 
position with the happy, peaceful time, I had spent on the Coral 
Island with my dear companions.&nbsp; As I thought upon Jack and 
Peterkin anxious forebodings crossed my mind, and I pictured to 
myself the grief and dismay with which they would search every 
nook and corner of the island, in a vain attempt to discover my 
dead body; for I felt assured that if they did not see any sign 
of the pirate schooner or boat, when they came out of the cave to
look for me, they would never imagine that I had been carried 
away.&nbsp; I wondered, too, how Jack would succeed in getting 
Peterkin out of the cave without my assistance; and I trembled 
when I thought that he might lose presence of mind, and begin to 
kick when he was in the tunnel!&nbsp; These thoughts were 
suddenly interrupted and put to flight by a bright red blaze 
which lighted up the horizon to the southward, and cut a crimson 
glow far over the sea.&nbsp; This appearance was accompanied by a
low growling sound, as of distant thunder, and, at the same time,
the sky above us became black, while a hot stifling wind blew 
around us in fitful gusts.</p>
<p>The crew assembled hastily on deck, and most of them were 
under the belief that a frightful hurricane was pending; but the 
captain coming on deck, soon explained the phenomena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a volcano,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I knew there was one hereabouts, but thought it was 
extinct.&nbsp; Up there and furl top-gallant-sails; we&rsquo;ll 
likely have a breeze, and it&rsquo;s well to be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, a shower began to fall, which we quickly observed
was not rain, but fine ashes.&nbsp; As we were many miles distant
from the volcano, these must have been carried to us from it by 
the wind.&nbsp; As the captain had predicted, a stiff breeze soon
afterwards sprang up, under the influence of which we speedily 
left the volcano far behind us; but during the greater part of 
the night we could see its lurid glare and hear its distant 
thunder.&nbsp; The shower did not cease to fall for several 
hours, and we must have sailed under it for nearly forty miles, 
perhaps farther.&nbsp; When we emerged from the cloud, our decks 
and every part of the rigging were completely covered with a 
thick coat of ashes.&nbsp; I was much interested in this, and 
recollected that Jack had often spoken of many of the islands of 
the Pacific as being volcanoes, either active or extinct, and had
said that the whole region was more or less volcanic, and that 
some scientific men were of opinion that the islands of the 
Pacific were nothing more or less than the mountain tops of a 
huge continent which had sunk under the influence of volcanic 
agency.</p>
<p>Three days after passing the volcano, we found ourselves a few
miles to windward of an island of considerable size and luxuriant
aspect.&nbsp; It consisted of two mountains, which seemed to be 
nearly four thousand feet high.&nbsp; They were separated from 
each other by a broad valley, whose thick-growing trees ascended 
a considerable distance up the mountain sides; and rich level 
plains, or meadow-land, spread round the base of the mountains, 
except at the point immediately opposite the large valley, where 
a river seemed to carry the trees, as it were, along with it down
to the white sandy shore.&nbsp; The mountain tops, unlike those 
of our Coral Island, were sharp, needle-shaped, and bare, while 
their sides were more rugged and grand in outline than anything I
had yet seen in those seas.&nbsp; Bloody Bill was beside me when 
the island first hove in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I know that island 
well.&nbsp; They call it Emo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been here before, then?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, that I have, often, and so has this schooner.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a famous island for sandal-wood.&nbsp; We have taken 
many cargoes off it already, and have paid for them too; for the 
savages are so numerous that we dared not try to take it by 
force.&nbsp; But our captain has tried to cheat them so often, 
that they&rsquo;re beginnin&rsquo; not to like us overmuch 
now.&nbsp; Besides, the men behaved ill the last time we were 
here; and I wonder the captain is not afraid to venture.&nbsp; 
But he&rsquo;s afraid o&rsquo; nothing earthly, I 
believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We soon ran inside the barrier coral-reef, and let go our 
anchor in six fathoms water, just opposite the mouth of a small 
creek, whose shores were densely covered with mangroves and tall 
umbrageous trees.&nbsp; The principal village of the natives lay 
about half a mile from this point.&nbsp; Ordering the boat out, 
the captain jumped into it, and ordered me to follow him.&nbsp; 
The men, fifteen in number, were well armed; and the mate was 
directed to have Long Tom ready for emergencies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give way, lads,&rdquo; cried the captain.</p>
<p>The oars fell into the water at the word, the boat shot from 
the schooner&rsquo;s side, and in a few minutes reached the 
shore.&nbsp; Here, contrary to our expectation, we were met with 
the utmost cordiality by Romata, the principal chief of the 
island, who conducted us to his house, and gave us mats to sit 
upon.&nbsp; I observed in passing that the natives, of whom there
were two or three thousand, were totally unarmed.</p>
<p>After a short preliminary palaver, a feast of baked pigs and 
various roots was spread before us; of which we partook 
sparingly, and then proceeded to business.&nbsp; The captain 
stated his object in visiting the island, regretted that there 
had been a slight misunderstanding during the last visit, and 
hoped that no ill-will was borne by either party, and that a 
satisfactory trade would be accomplished.</p>
<p>Romata answered that he had forgotten there had been any 
differences between them, protested that he was delighted to see 
his friends again, and assured them they should have every 
assistance in cutting and embarking the wood.&nbsp; The terms 
were afterwards agreed on, and we rose to depart.&nbsp; All this 
conversation was afterwards explained to me by Bill, who 
understood the language pretty well.</p>
<p>Romata accompanied us on board, and explained that a great 
chief from another island was then on a visit to him, and that he
was to be ceremoniously entertained on the following day.&nbsp; 
After begging to be allowed to introduce him to us, and receiving
permission, he sent his canoe ashore to bring him off.&nbsp; At 
the same time he gave orders to bring on board his two 
favourites, a cock and a paroquet.&nbsp; While the canoe was gone
on this errand, I had time to regard the savage chief 
attentively.&nbsp; He was a man of immense size, with massive but
beautifully moulded limbs and figure, only parts of which, the 
broad chest and muscular arms, were uncovered; for, although the 
lower orders generally wore no other clothing than a strip of 
cloth called <i>maro</i> round their loins, the chief, on 
particular occasions, wrapped his person in voluminous folds of a
species of native cloth made from the bark of the Chinese 
paper-mulberry.&nbsp; Romata wore a magnificent black beard and 
moustache, and his hair was frizzed out to such an extent that it
resembled a large turban, in which was stuck a long wooden 
pin!&nbsp; I afterwards found that this pin served for scratching
the head, for which purpose the fingers were too short without 
disarranging the hair.&nbsp; But Romata put himself to much 
greater inconvenience on account of his hair, for we found that 
he slept with his head resting on a wooden pillow, in which was 
cut a hollow for the neck, so that the hair of the sleeper might 
not be disarranged.</p>
<p>In ten minutes the canoe returned, bringing the other chief, 
who certainly presented a most extraordinary appearance, having 
painted one half of his face red and the other half yellow, 
besides ornamenting it with various designs in black!&nbsp; 
Otherwise he was much the same in appearance as Romata, though 
not so powerfully built.&nbsp; As this chief had never seen a 
ship before, except, perchance, some of the petty traders that at
long intervals visit these remote islands, he was much taken up 
with the neatness and beauty of all the fittings of the 
schooner.&nbsp; He was particularly struck with a musket which 
was shown to him, and asked where the white men got hatchets hard
enough to cut the tree of which the barrel was made!&nbsp; While 
he was thus engaged, his brother chief stood aloof, talking with 
the captain, and fondling a superb cock and a little blue-headed 
paroquet, the favourites of which I have before spoken.&nbsp; I 
observed that all the other natives walked in a crouching posture
while in the presence of Romata.&nbsp; Before our guests left us,
the captain ordered the brass gun to be uncovered and fired for 
their gratification; and I have every reason to believe he did so
for the purpose of showing our superior power, in case the 
natives should harbour any evil designs against us.&nbsp; Romata 
had never seen this gun before, as it had not been uncovered on 
previous visits, and the astonishment with which he viewed it was
very amusing.&nbsp; Being desirous of knowing its power, he 
begged that the captain would fire it.&nbsp; So a shot was put 
into it.&nbsp; The chiefs were then directed to look at a rock 
about two miles out at sea, and the gun was fired.&nbsp; In a 
second the top of the rock was seen to burst asunder, and to fall
in fragments into the sea.</p>
<p>Romata was so delighted with the success of this shot, that he
pointed to a man who was walking on the shore, and begged the 
captain to fire at him, evidently supposing that his permission 
was quite sufficient to justify the captain in such an act.&nbsp;
He was therefore surprised, and not a little annoyed, when the 
captain refused to fire at the native, and ordered the gun to be 
housed.</p>
<p>Of all the things, however, that afforded matter of amusement 
to these savages, that which pleased Romata&rsquo;s visitor most 
was the ship&rsquo;s pump.&nbsp; He never tired of examining it, 
and pumping up the water.&nbsp; Indeed, so much was he taken up 
with this pump, that he could not be prevailed on to return on 
shore, but sent a canoe to fetch his favourite stool, on which he
seated himself, and spent the remainder of the day in pumping the
bilge-water out of the ship!</p>
<p>Next day the crew went ashore to cut sandal-wood, while the 
captain, with one or two men, remained on board, in order to be 
ready, if need be, with the brass gun, which was unhoused and 
conspicuously elevated, with its capacious muzzle directed point 
blank at the chief&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; The men were fully armed 
as usual; and the captain ordered me to go with them, to assist 
in the work.&nbsp; I was much pleased with this order, for it 
freed me from the captain&rsquo;s company, which I could not now 
endure, and it gave me an opportunity of seeing the natives.</p>
<p>As we wound along in single file through the rich fragrant 
groves of banana, cocoa-nut, bread-fruit, and other trees, I 
observed that there were many of the plum and banian trees, with 
which I had become familiar on the Coral Island.&nbsp; I noticed 
also large quantities of taro-roots, yams, and sweet potatoes, 
growing in enclosures.&nbsp; On turning into an open glade of the
woods, we came abruptly upon a cluster of native houses.&nbsp; 
They were built chiefly of bamboos, and were thatched with the 
large thick leaves of the pandanus; but many of them had little 
more than a sloping roof and three sides with an open front, 
being the most simple shelter from the weather that could well be
imagined.&nbsp; Within these, and around them, were groups of 
natives&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;who all stood up to 
gaze at us as we marched along, followed by the party of men whom
the chief had sent to escort us.&nbsp; About half a mile inland 
we arrived at the spot where the sandal-wood grew, and, while the
men set to work, I clambered up an adjoining hill to observe the 
country.</p>
<p>About mid-day, the chief arrived with several followers, one 
of whom carried a baked pig on a wooden platter, with yams and 
potatoes on several plantain leaves, which he presented to the 
men, who sat down under the shade of a tree to dine.&nbsp; The 
chief sat down to dine also; but, to my surprise, instead of 
feeding himself, one of his wives performed that office for 
him!&nbsp; I was seated beside Bill, and asked him the reason of 
this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is beneath his dignity, I believe, to feed 
himself,&rdquo; answered Bill; &ldquo;but I daresay he&rsquo;s 
not particular, except on great occasions.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve a 
strange custom among them, Ralph, which is called <i>tabu</i>, 
and they carry it to great lengths.&nbsp; If a man chooses a 
particular tree for his god, the fruit o&rsquo; that tree is 
tabued to him; and if he eats it, he is sure to be killed by his 
people, and eaten, of course, for killing means eating 
hereaway.&nbsp; Then, you see that great mop o&rsquo; hair on the
chief&rsquo;s head?&nbsp; Well, he has a lot o&rsquo; barbers to 
keep it in order; and it&rsquo;s a law that whoever touches the 
head of a living chief or the body of a dead one, his hands are 
tabued; so, in that way, the barbers&rsquo; hands are always 
tabued, and they daren&rsquo;t use them for their lives, but have
to be fed like big babies, as they are, sure enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd, Bill.&nbsp; But look there,&rdquo; 
said I, pointing to a man whose skin was of a much lighter colour
than the generality of the natives.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen 
a few of these light-skinned fellows among the Fejeeans.&nbsp; 
They seem to me to be of quite a different race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they are,&rdquo; answered Bill.&nbsp; &ldquo;These 
fellows come from the Tongan Islands, which lie a long way to the
eastward.&nbsp; They come here to build their big war-canoes; and
as these take two, and sometimes four years, to build, 
there&rsquo;s always some o&rsquo; the brown-skins among the 
black sarpents o&rsquo; these islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Bill,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;your mentioning
serpents, reminds me that I have not seen a reptile of any kind 
since I came to this part of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more there are any,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;if ye 
except the niggers themselves, there&rsquo;s none on the islands,
but a lizard or two and some sich harmless things.&nbsp; But I 
never seed any myself.&nbsp; If there&rsquo;s none on the land, 
however, there&rsquo;s more than enough in the water, and that 
minds me of a wonderful brute they have here.&nbsp; But, come, 
I&rsquo;ll show it to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; So saying, Bill arose, 
and, leaving the men still busy with the baked pig, led me into 
the forest.&nbsp; After proceeding a short distance we came upon 
a small pond of stagnant water.&nbsp; A native lad had followed 
us, to whom we called and beckoned him to come to us.&nbsp; On 
Bill saying a few words to him, which I did not understand, the 
boy advanced to the edge of the pond, and gave a low peculiar 
whistle.&nbsp; Immediately the water became agitated and an 
enormous eel thrust its head above the surface and allowed the 
youth to touch it.&nbsp; It was about twelve feet long, and as 
thick round the body as a man&rsquo;s thigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Bill, his lip curling with contempt,
&ldquo;what do you think of that for a god, Ralph?&nbsp; This is 
one o&rsquo; their gods, and it has been fed with dozens o&rsquo;
livin&rsquo; babies already.&nbsp; How many more it&rsquo;ll get 
afore it dies is hard to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Babies?&rdquo; said I, with an incredulous look</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, babies,&rdquo; returned Bill.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your 
soft-hearted folk at home would say, &lsquo;Oh, horrible! 
impossible!&rsquo; to that, and then go away as comfortable and 
unconcerned as if their sayin&rsquo; &lsquo;horrible! 
impossible!&rsquo; had made it a lie.&nbsp; But I tell you, 
Ralph, it&rsquo;s a <i>fact</i>.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seed it with my
own eyes the last time I was here, an&rsquo; mayhap if you stop a
while at this accursed place, and keep a sharp look out, 
you&rsquo;ll see it too.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t feed it regularly
with livin&rsquo; babies, but they give it one now and then as a 
treat.&nbsp; Bah! you brute!&rsquo; cried Bill, in disgust, 
giving the reptile a kick on the snout with his heavy boot, that 
sent it sweltering back in agony into its loathsome pool.&nbsp; I
thought it lucky for Bill, indeed for all of us, that the native 
youth&rsquo;s back happened to be turned at the time, for I am 
certain that if the poor savages had come to know that we had so 
rudely handled their god, we should have had to fight our way 
back to the ship.&nbsp; As we retraced our steps I questioned my 
companion further on this subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How comes it, Bill, that the mothers allow such a 
dreadful thing to be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow it? the mothers <i>do</i> it!&nbsp; It seems to 
me that there&rsquo;s nothing too fiendish or diabolical for 
these people to do.&nbsp; Why, in some of the islands they have 
an institution called the <i>Areoi</i>, and the persons connected
with that body are ready for any wickedness that mortal man can 
devise.&nbsp; In fact they stick at nothing; and one o&rsquo; 
their customs is to murder their infants the moment they are 
born.&nbsp; The mothers agree to it, and the fathers do it.&nbsp;
And the mildest ways they have of murdering them is by sticking 
them through the body with sharp splinters of bamboo, strangling 
them with their thumbs, or burying them alive and stamping them 
to death while under the sod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt sick at heart while my companion recited these 
horrors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a curious fact,&rdquo; he continued, 
after a pause, during which we walked in silence towards the spot
where we had left our comrades,&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a curious
fact, that wherever the missionaries get a footin&rsquo; all 
these things come to an end at once, an&rsquo; the savages take 
to doin&rsquo; each other good, and singin&rsquo; psalms, just 
like Methodists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless the missionaries!&rdquo; said I, while a 
feeling of enthusiasm filled my heart, so that I could speak with
difficulty.&nbsp; &ldquo;God bless and prosper the missionaries 
till they get a footing in every island of the sea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would say Amen to that prayer, Ralph, if I 
could,&rdquo; said Bill, in a deep, sad voice; &ldquo;but it 
would be a mere mockery for a man to ask a blessing for others 
who dare not ask one for himself.&nbsp; But, Ralph,&rdquo; he 
continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not told you half o&rsquo; the 
abominations I have seen durin&rsquo; my life in these 
seas.&nbsp; If we pull long together, lad, I&rsquo;ll tell you 
more; and if times have not changed very much since I was here 
last, it&rsquo;s like that you&rsquo;ll have a chance o&rsquo; 
seeing a little for yourself before long.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<p>The Sandal-wood party&mdash;Native children&rsquo;s games, 
somewhat surprising&mdash;Desperate amusements suddenly and 
fatally brought to a close&mdash;An old friend 
recognised&mdash;News&mdash;Romata&rsquo;s mad conduct.</p>
<p>Next day the wood-cutting party went ashore again, and I 
accompanied them as before.&nbsp; During the dinner hour I 
wandered into the woods alone, being disinclined for food that 
day.&nbsp; I had not rambled far when I found myself unexpectedly
on the sea-shore, having crossed a narrow neck of land which 
separated the native village from a large bay.&nbsp; Here I found
a party of the islanders busy with one of their war-canoes, which
was almost ready for launching.&nbsp; I stood for a long time 
watching this party with great interest, and observed that they 
fastened the timbers and planks to each other very much in the 
same way in which I had seen Jack fasten those of our little 
boat.&nbsp; But what surprised me most was its immense length, 
which I measured very carefully, and found to be a hundred feet 
long; and it was so capacious that it could have held three 
hundred men.&nbsp; It had the unwieldy out-rigger and enormously 
high stern-posts which I had remarked on the canoe that came to 
us while I was on the Coral Island.&nbsp; Observing some boys 
playing at games a short way along the beach, I resolved to go 
and watch them; but as I turned from the natives who were engaged
so busily and cheerfully at their work, I little thought of the 
terrible event that hung on the completion of that war-canoe.</p>
<p>Advancing towards the children, who were so numerous that I 
began to think this must be the general play-ground of the 
village, I sat down on a grassy bank under the shade of a 
plantain-tree, to watch them.&nbsp; And a happier or more noisy 
crew I have never seen.&nbsp; There were at least two hundred of 
them, both boys and girls, all of whom were clad in no other 
garments than their own glossy little black skins, except the 
maro, or strip of cloth round the loins of the boys, and a very 
short petticoat or kilt on the girls.&nbsp; They did not all play
at the same game, but amused themselves in different groups.</p>
<p>One band was busily engaged in a game exactly similar to our 
blind-man&rsquo;s-buff.&nbsp; Another set were walking on stilts,
which raised the children three feet from the ground.&nbsp; They 
were very expert at this amusement and seldom tumbled.&nbsp; In 
another place I observed a group of girls standing together, and 
apparently enjoying themselves very much; so I went up to see 
what they were doing, and found that they were opening their 
eye-lids with their fingers till their eyes appeared of an 
enormous size, and then thrusting pieces of straw between the 
upper and lower lids, across the eye-ball, to keep them in that 
position!&nbsp; This seemed to me, I must confess, a very foolish
as well as dangerous amusement.&nbsp; Nevertheless the children 
seemed to be greatly delighted with the hideous faces they 
made.&nbsp; I pondered this subject a good deal, and thought that
if little children knew how silly they seem to grown-up people 
when they make faces, they would not be so fond of doing 
it.&nbsp; In another place were a number of boys engaged in 
flying kites, and I could not help wondering that some of the 
games of those little savages should be so like to our own, 
although they had never seen us at play.&nbsp; But the kites were
different from ours in many respects, being of every variety of 
shape.&nbsp; They were made of very thin cloth, and the boys 
raised them to a wonderful height in the air by means of twine 
made from the cocoa-nut husk.&nbsp; Other games there were, some 
of which showed the natural depravity of the hearts of these poor
savages, and made me wish fervently that missionaries might be 
sent out to them.&nbsp; But the amusement which the greatest 
number of the children of both sexes seemed to take chief delight
in, was swimming and diving in the sea; and the expertness which 
they exhibited was truly amazing.&nbsp; They seemed to have two 
principal games in the water, one of which was to dive off a sort
of stage which had been erected near a deep part of the sea, and 
chase each other in the water.&nbsp; Some of them went down to an
extraordinary depth; others skimmed along the surface, or rolled 
over and over like porpoises, or diving under each other, came up
unexpectedly and pulled each other down by a leg or an arm.&nbsp;
They never seemed to tire of this sport, and, from the great heat
of the water in the South Seas, they could remain in it nearly 
all day without feeling chilled.&nbsp; Many of these children 
were almost infants, scarce able to walk; yet they staggered down
the beach, flung their round fat little black bodies fearlessly 
into deep water, and struck out to sea with as much confidence as
ducklings.</p>
<p>The other game to which I have referred was swimming in the 
surf.&nbsp; But as this is an amusement in which all engage, from
children of ten to gray-headed men of sixty, and as I had an 
opportunity of witnessing it in perfection the day following, I 
shall describe it more minutely.</p>
<p>I suppose it was in honour of their guest that this grand 
swimming-match was got up, for Romata came and told the captain 
that they were going to engage in it, and begged him to 
&ldquo;come and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of amusement is this surf swimming?&rdquo; I 
inquired of Bill, as we walked together to a part of the shore on
which several thousands of the natives were assembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very favourite lark with these 
&rsquo;xtr&rsquo;or&rsquo;nary critters,&rdquo; replied Bill, 
giving a turn to the quid of tobacco that invariably bulged out 
his left cheek.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye see, Ralph, them fellows take to 
the water as soon a&rsquo;most as they can walk, an&rsquo; long 
before they can do that anything respectably, so that they are as
much at home in the sea as on the land.&nbsp; Well, ye see, I 
&rsquo;spose they found swimmin&rsquo; for miles out to sea, and 
divin&rsquo; fathoms deep, wasn&rsquo;t exciting enough, so they 
invented this game o&rsquo; the surf.&nbsp; Each man and boy, as 
you see, has got a short board or plank, with which he swims out 
for a mile or more to sea, and then, gettin&rsquo; on the top 
o&rsquo; yon thundering breaker, they come to shore on the top of
it, yellin&rsquo; and screechin&rsquo; like fiends.&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s a marvel to me that they&rsquo;re not dashed to 
shivers on the coral reef, for sure an&rsquo; sartin am I that if
any o&rsquo; us tried it, we wouldn&rsquo;t be worth the fluke of
a broken anchor after the wave fell.&nbsp; But there they 
go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, several hundreds of the natives, amongst whom we 
were now standing, uttered a loud yell, rushed down the beach, 
plunged into the surf, and were carried off by the seething foam 
of the retreating wave.</p>
<p>At the point where we stood, the encircling coral reef joined 
the shore, so that the magnificent breakers, which a recent stiff
breeze had rendered larger than usual, fell in thunder at the 
feet of the multitudes who lined the beach.&nbsp; For some time 
the swimmers continued to strike out to sea, breasting over the 
swell like hundreds of black seals.&nbsp; Then they all turned, 
and, watching an approaching billow, mounted its white crest, 
and, each laying his breast on the short flat board, came rolling
towards the shore, careering on the summit of the mighty wave, 
while they and the onlookers shouted and yelled with 
excitement.&nbsp; Just as the monster wave curled in solemn 
majesty to fling its bulky length upon the beach, most of the 
swimmers slid back into the trough behind; others, slipping off 
their boards, seized them in their hands, and, plunging through 
the watery waste, swam out to repeat the amusement; but a few, 
who seemed to me the most reckless, continued their career until 
they were launched upon the beach, and enveloped in the churning 
foam and spray.&nbsp; One of these last came in on the crest of 
the wave most manfully, and landed with a violent bound almost on
the spot where Bill and I stood.&nbsp; I saw by his peculiar 
head-dress that he was the chief whom the tribe entertained as 
their guest.&nbsp; The sea-water had removed nearly all the paint
with which his face had been covered; and, as he rose panting to 
his feet, I recognised, to my surprise, the features of Tararo, 
my old friend of the Coral Island!</p>
<p>Tararo at the same moment recognised me, and, advancing 
quickly, took me round the neck and rubbed noses; which had the 
effect of transferring a good deal of the moist paint from his 
nose to mine.&nbsp; Then, recollecting that this was not the 
white man&rsquo;s mode of salutation, he grasped me by the hand 
and shook it violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo, Ralph!&rdquo; cried Bill, in surprise, 
&ldquo;that chap seems to have taken a sudden fancy to you, or he
must be an old acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, Bill,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;he is indeed an 
old acquaintance;&rdquo; and I explained in a few words that he 
was the chief whose party Jack and Peterkin and I had helped to 
save.</p>
<p>Tararo having thrown away his surf-board, entered into an 
animated conversation with Bill, pointing frequently during the 
course of it to me; whereby I concluded he must be telling him 
about the memorable battle, and the part we had taken in 
it.&nbsp; When he paused, I begged of Bill to ask him about the 
woman Avatea, for I had some hope that she might have come with 
Tararo on this visit.&nbsp; &ldquo;And ask him,&rdquo; said I, 
&ldquo;who she is, for I am persuaded she is of a different race 
from the Feejeeans.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the mention of her name the 
chief frowned darkly, and seemed to speak with much anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Ralph,&rdquo; said Bill, when the 
chief had ceased to talk; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s not a Feejee girl, 
but a Samoan.&nbsp; How she ever came to this place the chief 
does not very clearly explain, but he says she was taken in war, 
and that he got her three years ago, an&rsquo; kept her as his 
daughter ever since.&nbsp; Lucky for her, poor girl, else 
she&rsquo;d have been roasted and eaten like the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why does Tararo frown and look so angry?&rdquo; 
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the girl&rsquo;s somewhat obstinate, like most 
o&rsquo; the sex, an&rsquo; won&rsquo;t marry the man he wants 
her to.&nbsp; It seems that a chief of some other island came on 
a visit to Tararo and took a fancy to her, but she wouldn&rsquo;t
have him on no account, bein&rsquo; already in love, and engaged 
to a young chief whom Tararo hates, and she kicked up a desperate
shindy; so, as he was going on a war expedition in his canoe, he 
left her to think about it, sayin&rsquo; he&rsquo;d be back in 
six months or so, when he hoped she wouldn&rsquo;t be so 
obstropolous.&nbsp; This happened just a week ago; an&rsquo; 
Tararo says that if she&rsquo;s not ready to go, when the chief 
returns, as his bride, she&rsquo;ll be sent to him as a <i>long 
pig</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a long pig!&rdquo; I exclaimed in surprise; 
&ldquo;why what does he mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means somethin&rsquo; very unpleasant,&rdquo; 
answered Bill with a frown.&nbsp; &ldquo;You see these 
blackguards eat men an&rsquo; women just as readily as they eat 
pigs; and, as baked pigs and baked men are very like each other 
in appearance, they call men <i>long</i> pigs.&nbsp; If Avatea 
goes to this fellow as a long pig, it&rsquo;s all up with her, 
poor thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she on the island now?&rdquo; I asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s at Tararo&rsquo;s island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where does it lie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About fifty or sixty miles to the south&rsquo;ard 
o&rsquo; this,&rdquo; returned Bill; &ldquo;but 
I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment we were startled by the cry of &ldquo;Mao! 
mao!&mdash;a shark! a shark!&rdquo; which was immediately 
followed by a shriek that rang clear and fearfully loud above the
tumult of cries that arose from the savages in the water and on 
the land.&nbsp; We turned hastily towards the direction whence 
the cry came, and had just time to observe the glaring eye-balls 
of one of the swimmers as he tossed his arms in the air.&nbsp; 
Next instant he was pulled under the waves.&nbsp; A canoe was 
instantly launched, and the hand of the drowning man was caught, 
but only half of his body was dragged from the maw of the 
monster, which followed the canoe until the water became so 
shallow that it could scarcely swim.&nbsp; The crest of the next 
billow was tinged with red as it rolled towards the shore.</p>
<p>In most countries of the world this would have made a deep 
impression on the spectators, but the only effect it had upon 
these islanders was to make them hurry with all speed out of the 
sea, lest a similar fate should befall some of the others; but, 
so utterly reckless were they of human life, that it did not for 
a moment suspend the progress of their amusements.&nbsp; It is 
true the surf-swimming ended for that time somewhat abruptly, but
they immediately proceeded with other games.&nbsp; Bill told me 
that sharks do not often attack the surf-swimmers, being 
frightened away by the immense numbers of men and boys in the 
water, and by the shouting and splashing that they make.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;such a thing as you have seen 
just now don&rsquo;t frighten them much.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll be 
at it again to-morrow or next day, just as if there wasn&rsquo;t 
a single shark between Feejee and Nova Zembla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this the natives had a series of wrestling and boxing 
matches; and being men of immense size and muscle, they did a 
good deal of injury to each other, especially in boxing, in which
not only the lower orders, but several of the chiefs and priests 
engaged.&nbsp; Each bout was very quickly terminated, for they 
did not pretend to a scientific knowledge of the art, and wasted 
no time in sparring, but hit straight out at each other&rsquo;s 
heads, and their blows were delivered with great force.&nbsp; 
Frequently one of the combatants was knocked down with a single 
blow; and one gigantic fellow hit his adversary so severely that 
he drove the skin entirely off his forehead.&nbsp; This feat was 
hailed with immense applause by the spectators.</p>
<p>During these exhibitions, which were very painful to me, 
though I confess I could not refrain from beholding them, I was 
struck with the beauty of many of the figures and designs that 
were tattooed on the persons of the chiefs and principal 
men.&nbsp; One figure, that seemed to me very elegant, was that 
of a palm-tree tattooed on the back of a man&rsquo;s leg, the 
roots rising, as it were, from under his heel, the stem ascending
the tendon of the ankle, and the graceful head branching out upon
the calf.&nbsp; I afterwards learned that this process of 
tattooing is very painful, and takes long to do, commencing at 
the age of ten, and being continued at intervals up to the age of
thirty.&nbsp; It is done by means of an instrument made of bone, 
with a number of sharp teeth with which the skin is 
punctured.&nbsp; Into these punctures a preparation made from the
kernel of the candle-nut, mixed with cocoa-nut oil, is rubbed, 
and the mark thus made is indelible.&nbsp; The operation is 
performed by a class of men whose profession it is, and they 
tattoo as much at a time, as the person on whom they are 
operating can bear; which is not much, the pain and inflammation 
caused by tattooing being very great, sometimes causing 
death.&nbsp; Some of the chiefs were tattooed with an ornamental 
stripe down the legs, which gave them the appearance of being 
clad in tights.&nbsp; Others had marks round the ankles and 
insteps, which looked like tight-fitting and elegant boots.&nbsp;
Their faces were also tattooed, and their breasts were very 
profusely marked with every imaginable species of 
device,&mdash;muskets, dogs, birds, pigs, clubs, and canoes, 
intermingled with lozenges, squares, circles, and other arbitrary
figures.</p>
<p>The women were not tattooed so much as the men, having only a 
few marks on their feet and arms.&nbsp; But I must say, however 
objectionable this strange practice may be, it nevertheless had 
this good effect, that it took away very much from their 
appearance of nakedness.</p>
<p>Next day, while we were returning from the woods to our 
schooner, we observed Romata rushing about in the neighbourhood 
of his house, apparently mad with passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Bill to me, &ldquo;there he&rsquo;s at 
his old tricks again.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s his way when he gets 
drink.&nbsp; The natives make a sort of drink o&rsquo; their own,
and it makes him bad enough; but when he gets brandy he&rsquo;s 
like a wild tiger.&nbsp; The captain, I suppose, has given him a 
bottle, as usual, to keep him in good humour.&nbsp; After 
drinkin&rsquo; he usually goes to sleep, and the people know it 
well and keep out of his way, for fear they should waken 
him.&nbsp; Even the babies are taken out of ear-shot; for, when 
he&rsquo;s waked up, he rushes out just as you see him now, and 
spears or clubs the first person he meets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed at the present time, however, that no deadly weapon 
had been in his way, for the infuriated chief was raging about 
without one.&nbsp; Suddenly he caught sight of an unfortunate man
who was trying to conceal himself behind a tree.&nbsp; Rushing 
towards him, Romata struck him a terrible blow on the head, which
knocked out the poor man&rsquo;s eye and also dislocated the 
chief&rsquo;s finger.&nbsp; The wretched creature offered no 
resistance; he did not even attempt to parry the blow.&nbsp; 
Indeed, from what Bill said, I found that he might consider 
himself lucky in having escaped with his life, which would 
certainly have been forfeited had the chief been possessed of a 
club at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have these wretched creatures no law among 
themselves,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;which can restrain such 
wickedness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; replied Bill.&nbsp; &ldquo;The 
chief&rsquo;s word is law.&nbsp; He might kill and eat a dozen of
his own subjects any day for nothing more than his own pleasure, 
and nobody would take the least notice of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This ferocious deed took place within sight of our party as we
wended our way to the beach, but I could not observe any other 
expression on the faces of the men than that of total 
indifference or contempt.&nbsp; It seemed to me a very awful 
thing that it should be possible for men to come to such hardness
of heart and callousness to the sight of bloodshed and violence; 
but, indeed, I began to find that such constant exposure to 
scenes of blood was having a slight effect upon myself, and I 
shuddered when I came to think that I, too, was becoming 
callous.</p>
<p>I thought upon this subject much that night while I walked up 
and down the deck during my hours of watch; and I came to the 
conclusion that if I, who hated, abhorred, and detested such 
bloody deeds as I had witnessed within the last few weeks, could 
so soon come to be less sensitive about them, how little wonder 
that these poor ignorant savages, who were born and bred in 
familiarity therewith, should think nothing of them at all, and 
should hold human life in so very slight esteem.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<p>Mischief brewing&mdash;My blood is made to run cold&mdash;Evil
consultations and wicked resolves&mdash;Bloody Bill attempts to 
do good and fails&mdash;The attack&mdash;Wholesale 
murder&mdash;The flight&mdash;The escape.</p>
<p>Next morning I awoke with a feverish brow and a feeling of 
deep depression at my heart; and the more I thought on my unhappy
fate, the more wretched and miserable did I feel.</p>
<p>I was surrounded on all sides by human beings of the most 
dreadful character, to whom the shedding of blood was mere 
pastime.&nbsp; On shore were the natives, whose practices were so
horrible that I could not think of them without shuddering.&nbsp;
On board were none but pirates of the blackest dye, who, although
not cannibals, were foul murderers, and more blameworthy even 
than the savages, inasmuch as they knew better.&nbsp; Even Bill, 
with whom I had, under the strange circumstances of my lot, 
formed a kind of intimacy, was so fierce in his nature as to have
acquired the title of &ldquo;Bloody&rdquo; from his vile 
companions.&nbsp; I felt very much cast down the more I 
considered the subject and the impossibility of delivery, as it 
seemed to me, at least for a long time to come.&nbsp; At last, in
my feeling of utter helplessness, I prayed fervently to the 
Almighty that he would deliver me out of my miserable condition; 
and when I had done so I felt some degree of comfort.</p>
<p>When the captain came on deck, before the hour at which the 
men usually started for the woods, I begged of him to permit me 
to remain aboard that day, as I did not feel well; but he looked 
at me angrily, and ordered me, in a surly tone, to get ready to 
go on shore as usual.&nbsp; The fact was that the captain had 
been out of humour for some time past.&nbsp; Romata and he had 
had some differences, and high words had passed between them, 
during which the chief had threatened to send a fleet of his 
war-canoes, with a thousand men, to break up and burn the 
schooner; whereupon the captain smiled sarcastically, and going 
up to the chief gazed sternly in his face, while he said, 
&ldquo;I have only to raise my little finger just now, and my big
gun will blow your whole village to atoms in five 
minutes!&rdquo;&nbsp; Although the chief was a bold man, he 
quailed before the pirate&rsquo;s glance and threat, and made no 
reply; but a bad feeling had been raised and old sores had been 
opened.</p>
<p>I had, therefore, to go with the wood-cutters that day.&nbsp; 
Before starting, however, the captain called me into the cabin, 
and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Ralph, I&rsquo;ve got a mission for you, 
lad.&nbsp; That blackguard Romata is in the dumps, and nothing 
will mollify him but a gift; so do you go up to his house and 
give him these whales&rsquo; teeth, with my compliments.&nbsp; 
Take with you one of the men who can speak the 
language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at the gift in some surprise, for it consisted of six
white whales&rsquo; teeth, and two of the same dyed bright red, 
which seemed to me very paltry things.&nbsp; However, I did not 
dare to hesitate or ask any questions; so, gathering them up, I 
left the cabin and was soon on my way to the chief&rsquo;s house,
accompanied by Bill.&nbsp; On expressing my surprise at the gift,
he said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re paltry enough to you or me, Ralph, but 
they&rsquo;re considered of great value by them chaps.&nbsp; 
They&rsquo;re a sort o&rsquo; cash among them.&nbsp; The red ones
are the most prized, one of them bein&rsquo; equal to twenty 
o&rsquo; the white ones.&nbsp; I suppose the only reason for 
their bein&rsquo; valuable is that there ain&rsquo;t many of 
them, and they&rsquo;re hard to be got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On arriving at the house we found Romata sitting on a mat, in 
the midst of a number of large bales of native cloth and other 
articles, which had been brought to him as presents from time to 
time by inferior chiefs.&nbsp; He received us rather haughtily, 
but on Bill explaining the nature of our errand he became very 
condescending, and his eyes glistened with satisfaction when he 
received the whales&rsquo; teeth, although he laid them aside 
with an assumption of kingly indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; said he, with a wave of the 
hand,&mdash;&ldquo;go, tell your captain that he may cut wood 
to-day, but not to-morrow.&nbsp; He must come ashore,&mdash;I 
want to have a palaver with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we left the house to return to the woods, Bill shook his 
head:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s mischief brewin&rsquo; in that black 
rascal&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; I know him of old.&nbsp; But what 
comes here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, we heard the sound of laughter and shouting in 
the wood, and presently there issued from it a band of savages, 
in the midst of whom were a number of men bearing burdens on 
their shoulders.&nbsp; At first I thought that these burdens were
poles with something rolled round them, the end of each pole 
resting on a man&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp; But on a nearer approach
I saw that they were human beings, tied hand and foot, and so 
lashed to the poles that they could not move.&nbsp; I counted 
twenty of them as they passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More murder!&rdquo; said Bill, in a voice that sounded 
between a hoarse laugh and a groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely they are not going to murder them?&rdquo; said 
I, looking anxiously into Bill&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Ralph,&rdquo; replied Bill, 
&ldquo;what they&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to do with them; but I fear
they mean no good when they tie fellows up in that 
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we continued our way towards the wood-cutters, I observed 
that Bill looked anxiously over his shoulder, in the direction 
where the procession had disappeared.&nbsp; At last he stopped, 
and turning abruptly on his heel, said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell ye what it is, Ralph, I must be at the bottom 
o&rsquo; that affair.&nbsp; Let us follow these black scoundrels 
and see what they&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I must say I had no wish to pry further into their bloody 
practices; but Bill seemed bent on it, so I turned and 
went.&nbsp; We passed rapidly through the bush, being guided in 
the right direction by the shouts of the savages.&nbsp; Suddenly 
there was a dead silence, which continued for some time, while 
Bill and I involuntarily quickened our pace until we were running
at the top of our speed across the narrow neck of land previously
mentioned.&nbsp; As we reached the verge of the wood, we 
discovered the savages surrounding the large war-canoe, which 
they were apparently on the point of launching.&nbsp; Suddenly 
the multitude put their united strength to the canoe; but 
scarcely had the huge machine begun to move, when a yell, the 
most appalling that ever fell upon my ear, rose high above the 
shouting of the savages.&nbsp; It had not died away when another 
and another smote upon my throbbing ear; and then I saw that 
these inhuman monsters were actually launching their canoe over 
the living bodies of their victims.&nbsp; But there was no pity 
in the breasts of these men.&nbsp; Forward they went in ruthless 
indifference, shouting as they went, while high above their 
voices rang the dying shrieks of those wretched creatures, as, 
one after another, the ponderous canoe passed over them, burst 
the eyeballs from their sockets, and sent the life&rsquo;s blood 
gushing from their mouths.&nbsp; Oh, reader, this is no 
fiction.&nbsp; I would not, for the sake of thrilling you with 
horror, invent so terrible a scene.&nbsp; It was witnessed.&nbsp;
It is true; true as that accursed sin which has rendered the 
human heart capable of such diabolical enormities!</p>
<p>When it was over I turned round and fell upon the grass with a
deep groan; but Bill seized me by the arm, and lifting me up as 
if I had been a child, cried,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, lad; let&rsquo;s away!&rdquo;&mdash;and so,
staggering and stumbling over the tangled underwood, we fled from
the fatal spot.</p>
<p>During the remainder of that day I felt as if I were in a 
horrible dream.&nbsp; I scarce knew what was said to me, and was 
more than once blamed by the men for idling my time.&nbsp; At 
last the hour to return aboard came.&nbsp; We marched down to the
beach, and I felt relief for the first time when my feet rested 
on the schooner&rsquo;s deck.</p>
<p>In the course of the evening I overheard part of a 
conversation between the captain and the first mate, which 
startled me not a little.&nbsp; They were down in the cabin, and 
conversed in an under-tone, but the sky-light being off, I 
overheard every word that was said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t half like it,&rdquo; said the mate.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It seems to me that we&rsquo;ll only have hard 
fightin&rsquo; and no pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No pay!&rdquo; repeated the captain, in a voice of 
suppressed anger.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you call a good cargo all for 
nothing no pay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; returned the mate; &ldquo;but 
we&rsquo;ve got the cargo aboard.&nbsp; Why not cut your cable 
and take French leave o&rsquo; them?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the use 
o&rsquo; tryin&rsquo; to lick the blackguards when it&rsquo;ll do
us no manner o&rsquo; good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mate,&rdquo; said the captain, in a low voice, 
&ldquo;you talk like a fresh-water sailor.&nbsp; I can only 
attribute this shyness to some strange delusion; for 
surely&rdquo; (his voice assumed a slightly sneering tone as he 
said this) &ldquo;surely I am not to suppose that <i>you</i> have
become soft-hearted!&nbsp; Besides, you are wrong in regard to 
the cargo being aboard; there&rsquo;s a good quarter of it lying 
in the woods, and that blackguard chief knows it and won&rsquo;t 
let me take it off.&nbsp; He defied us to do our worst, 
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Defied us! did he?&rdquo; cried the mate, with a bitter
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor contemptible thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet he seems not so contemptible but that you are 
afraid to attack him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said I was afraid?&rdquo; growled the mate, 
sulkily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as ready as any man in the 
ship.&nbsp; But, captain, what is it that you intend to 
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intend to muffle the sweeps and row the schooner up 
to the head of the creek there, from which point we can command 
the pile of sandal-wood with our gun.&nbsp; Then I shall land 
with all the men except two, who shall take care of the schooner 
and be ready with the boat to take us off.&nbsp; We can creep 
through the woods to the head of the village, where these 
cannibals are always dancing round their suppers of human flesh, 
and if the carbines of the men are loaded with a heavy charge of 
buck-shot, we can drop forty or fifty at the first volley.&nbsp; 
After that the thing will be easy enough.&nbsp; The savages will 
take to the mountains in a body, and we shall take what we 
require, up anchor, and away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this plan the mate at length agreed.&nbsp; As he left the 
cabin I heard the captain say,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give the men an extra glass of grog, and don&rsquo;t 
forget the buck-shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reader may conceive the horror with which I heard this 
murderous conversation.&nbsp; I immediately repeated it to Bill, 
who seemed much perplexed about it.&nbsp; At length he 
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do, Ralph: 
I&rsquo;ll swim ashore after dark and fix a musket to a tree not 
far from the place where we&rsquo;ll have to land, and I&rsquo;ll
tie a long string to the trigger, so that when our fellows cross 
it they&rsquo;ll let it off, and so alarm the village in time to 
prevent an attack, but not in time to prevent us gettin&rsquo; 
back to the boat; so, master captain,&rdquo; added Bill with a 
smile that for the first time seemed to me to be mingled with 
good-natured cheerfulness, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be baulked at 
least for once in your life by Bloody Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After it grew dark, Bill put this resolve in practice.&nbsp; 
He slipped over the side with a musket in his left hand, while 
with his right he swam ashore and entered the woods.&nbsp; He 
soon returned, having accomplished his purpose, and got on board 
without being seen,&mdash;I being the only one on deck.</p>
<p>When the hour of midnight approached the men were mustered on 
deck, the cable was cut and the muffled sweeps got out.&nbsp; 
These sweeps were immensely large oars, each requiring a couple 
of men to work it.&nbsp; In a few minutes we entered the mouth of
the creek, which was indeed the mouth of a small river, and took 
about half an hour to ascend it, although the spot where we 
intended to land was not more than six hundred yards from the 
mouth, because there was a slight current against us, and the 
mangroves which narrowed the creek, impeded the rowers in some 
places.&nbsp; Having reached the spot, which was so darkened by 
overhanging trees that we could see with difficulty, a small 
kedge anchor attached to a thin line was let softly down over the
stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, lads,&rdquo; whispered the captain, as he walked 
along the line of men, who were all armed to the teeth, 
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t be in a hurry, aim low, and don&rsquo;t waste 
your first shots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then pointed to the boat, into which the men crowded in 
silence.&nbsp; There was no room to row, but oars were not 
needed, as a slight push against the side of the schooner sent 
the boat gliding to the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need of leaving two in the 
boat,&rdquo; whispered the mate, as the men stepped out; 
&ldquo;we shall want all our hands.&nbsp; Let Ralph 
stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain assented, and ordered me to stand in readiness 
with the boat-hook, to shove ashore at a moment&rsquo;s notice if
they should return, or to shove off if any of the savages should 
happen to approach.&nbsp; He then threw his carbine into the 
hollow of his arm and glided through the bushes followed by his 
men.&nbsp; With a throbbing head I awaited the result of our 
plan.&nbsp; I knew the exact locality where the musket was 
placed, for Bill had described it to me, and I kept my straining 
eyes fixed upon the spot.&nbsp; But no sound came, and I began to
fear that either they had gone in another direction or that Bill 
had not fixed the string properly.&nbsp; Suddenly I heard a faint
click, and observed one or two bright sparks among the 
bushes.&nbsp; My heart immediately sank within me, for I knew at 
once that the trigger had indeed been pulled but that the priming
had not caught.&nbsp; The plan, therefore, had utterly 
failed.&nbsp; A feeling of dread now began to creep over me as I 
stood in the boat, in that dark, silent spot, awaiting the issue 
of this murderous expedition.&nbsp; I shuddered as I glanced at 
the water that glided past like a dark reptile.&nbsp; I looked 
back at the schooner, but her hull was just barely visible, while
her tapering masts were lost among the trees which overshadowed 
her.&nbsp; Her lower sails were set, but so thick was the gloom 
that they were quite invisible.</p>
<p>Suddenly I heard a shot.&nbsp; In a moment a thousand voices 
raised a yell in the village; again the cry rose on the night 
air, and was followed by broken shouts as of scattered parties of
men bounding into the woods.&nbsp; Then I heard another shout 
loud and close at hand.&nbsp; It was the voice of the captain 
cursing the man who had fired the premature shot.&nbsp; Then came
the order, &ldquo;Forward,&rdquo; followed by the wild hurrah of 
our men, as they charged the savages.&nbsp; Shots now rang in 
quick succession, and at last a loud volley startled the echoes 
of the woods.&nbsp; It was followed by a multitude of wild 
shrieks, which were immediately drowned in another 
&ldquo;hurrah&rdquo; from the men; the distance of the sound 
proving that they were driving their enemies before them towards 
the sea.</p>
<p>While I was listening intently to these sounds, which were now
mingled in confusion, I was startled by the rustling of the 
leaves not far from me.&nbsp; At first I thought it was a party 
of savages who had observed the schooner, but I was speedily 
undeceived by observing a body of natives&mdash;apparently 
several hundreds, as far as I could guess in the uncertain 
light&mdash;bounding through the woods towards the scene of 
battle.&nbsp; I saw at once that this was a party who had 
out-flanked our men, and would speedily attack them in the 
rear.&nbsp; And so it turned out, for, in a short time, the 
shouts increased ten-fold, and among them I thought I heard a 
death-cry uttered by voices familiar to my ear.</p>
<p>At length the tumult of battle ceased, and, from the cries of 
exultation that now arose from the savages, I felt assured that 
our men had been conquered.&nbsp; I was immediately thrown into 
dreadful consternation.&nbsp; What was I now to do?&nbsp; To be 
taken by the savages was too horrible to be thought of; to flee 
to the mountains was hopeless, as I should soon be discovered; 
and to take the schooner out of the creek without assistance was 
impossible.&nbsp; I resolved, however, to make the attempt, as 
being my only hope, and was on the point of pushing off when my 
hand was stayed and my blood chilled by an appalling shriek in 
which I recognised the voice of one of the crew.&nbsp; It was 
succeeded by a shout from the savages.&nbsp; Then came another, 
and another shriek of agony, making my ears to tingle, as I felt 
convinced they were murdering the pirate crew in cold 
blood.&nbsp; With a bursting heart and my brain whirling as if on
fire, I seized the boat-hook to push from shore when a man sprang
from the bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! Ralph, stop!&mdash;there now, push off,&rdquo; he
cried, and bounded into the boat so violently as nearly to upset 
her.&nbsp; It was Bill&rsquo;s voice!&nbsp; In another moment we 
were on board,&mdash;the boat made fast, the line of the anchor 
cut, and the sweeps run out.&nbsp; At the first stroke of 
Bill&rsquo;s giant arm the schooner was nearly pulled ashore, for
in his haste he forgot that I could scarcely move the unwieldy 
oar.&nbsp; Springing to the stern he lashed the rudder in such a 
position as that, while it aided me, it acted against him, and so
rendered the force of our strokes nearly equal.&nbsp; The 
schooner now began to glide quickly down the creek, but before we
reached its mouth, a yell from a thousand voices on the bank told
that we were discovered.&nbsp; Instantly a number of the savages 
plunged into the water and swam towards us; but we were making so
much way that they could not overtake us.&nbsp; One, however, an 
immensely powerful man, succeeded in laying hold of the cut rope 
that hung from the stern, and clambered quickly upon deck.&nbsp; 
Bill caught sight of him the instant his head appeared above the 
taffrail.&nbsp; But he did not cease to row, and did not appear 
even to notice the savage until he was within a yard of him; 
then, dropping the sweep, he struck him a blow on the forehead 
with his clenched fist that felled him to the deck.&nbsp; Lifting
him up he hurled him overboard and resumed the oar.&nbsp; But now
a greater danger awaited us, for the savages had outrun us on the
bank and were about to plunge into the water ahead of the 
schooner.&nbsp; If they succeeded in doing so our fate was 
sealed.&nbsp; For one moment Bill stood irresolute.&nbsp; Then, 
drawing a pistol from his belt, he sprang to the brass gun, held 
the pan of his pistol over the touch-hole and fired.&nbsp; The 
shot was succeeded by the hiss of the cannon&rsquo;s priming, 
then the blaze and the crashing thunder of the monstrous gun 
burst upon the savages with such deafening roar that it seemed as
if their very mountains had been rent asunder.</p>
<p>This was enough.&nbsp; The moment of surprise and hesitation 
caused by the unwonted sound, gave us time to pass the point; a 
gentle breeze, which the dense foliage had hitherto prevented us 
from feeling, bulged out our sails; the schooner bent before it, 
and the shouts of the disappointed savages grew fainter and 
fainter in the distance as we were slowly wafted out to sea.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<p>Reflections&mdash;The wounded man&mdash;The squall&mdash;True 
consolation&mdash;Death.</p>
<p>There is a power of endurance in human beings, both in their 
bodies and in their minds, which, I have often thought, seems to 
be wonderfully adapted and exactly proportioned to the 
circumstances in which individuals may happen to be 
placed,&mdash;a power which, in most cases, is sufficient to 
carry a man through and over every obstacle that may happen to be
thrown in his path through life, no matter how high or how steep 
the mountain may be, but which often forsakes him the moment the 
summit is gained, the point of difficulty passed; and leaves him 
prostrated, with energies gone, nerves unstrung, and a feeling of
incapacity pervading the entire frame that renders the most 
trifling effort almost impossible.</p>
<p>During the greater part of that day I had been subjected to 
severe mental and much physical excitement, which had almost 
crushed me down by the time I was relieved from duty in the 
course of the evening.&nbsp; But when the expedition, whose 
failure has just been narrated, was planned, my anxieties and 
energies had been so powerfully aroused that I went through the 
protracted scenes of that terrible night without a feeling of the
slightest fatigue.&nbsp; My mind and body were alike active and 
full of energy.&nbsp; No sooner was the last thrilling fear of 
danger past, however, than my faculties were utterly relaxed; 
and, when I felt the cool breezes of the Pacific playing around 
my fevered brow, and heard the free waves rippling at the 
schooner&rsquo;s prow, as we left the hated island behind us, my 
senses forsook me and I fell in a swoon upon the deck.</p>
<p>From this state I was quickly aroused by Bill, who shook me by
the arm, saying,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo! Ralph, boy, rouse up, lad, we&rsquo;re safe 
now.&nbsp; Poor thing, I believe he&rsquo;s fainted.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And raising me in his arms he laid me on the folds of the 
gaff-top-sail, which lay upon the deck near the tiller.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Here, take a drop o&rsquo; this, it&rsquo;ll do you good, 
my boy,&rdquo; he added, in a voice of tenderness which I had 
never heard him use before, while he held a brandy-flask to my 
lips.</p>
<p>I raised my eyes gratefully, as I swallowed a mouthful; next 
moment my head sank heavily upon my arm and I fell fast 
asleep.&nbsp; I slept long, for when I awoke the sun was a good 
way above the horizon.&nbsp; I did not move on first opening my 
eyes, as I felt a delightful sensation of rest pervading me, and 
my eyes were riveted on and charmed with the gorgeous splendour 
of the mighty ocean, that burst upon my sight.&nbsp; It was a 
dead calm; the sea seemed a sheet of undulating crystal, tipped 
and streaked with the saffron hues of sunrise, which had not yet 
merged into the glowing heat of noon; and there was a deep calm 
in the blue dome above, that was not broken even by the usual 
flutter of the sea-fowl.&nbsp; How long I would have lain in 
contemplation of this peaceful scene I know not, but my mind was 
recalled suddenly and painfully to the past and the present by 
the sight of Bill, who was seated on the deck at my feet with his
head reclining, as if in sleep, on his right arm, which rested on
the tiller.&nbsp; As he seemed to rest peacefully I did not mean 
to disturb him, but the slight noise I made in raising myself on 
my elbow caused him to start and look round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ralph, awake at last, my boy; you have slept long
and soundly,&rdquo; he said, turning towards me.</p>
<p>On beholding his countenance I sprang up in anxiety.&nbsp; He 
was deadly pale, and his hair, which hung in dishevelled locks 
over his face, was clotted with blood.&nbsp; Blood also stained 
his hollow cheeks and covered the front of his shirt, which, with
the greater part of dress, was torn and soiled with mud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bill!&rdquo; said I, with deep anxiety, &ldquo;what
is the matter with you?&nbsp; You are ill.&nbsp; You must have 
been wounded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, lad,&rdquo; said Bill in a deep soft voice, 
while he extended his huge frame on the couch from which I had 
just risen.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an ugly wound, I fear, 
and I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you to waken, to ask you to get 
me a drop o&rsquo; brandy and a mouthful o&rsquo; bread from the 
cabin lockers.&nbsp; You seemed to sleep so sweetly, Ralph, that 
I didn&rsquo;t like to disturb you.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t feel 
up to much just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not wait till he had done talking, but ran below 
immediately, and returned in a few seconds with a bottle of 
brandy and some broken biscuit.&nbsp; He seemed much refreshed 
after eating a few morsels and drinking a long draught of water 
mingled with a little of the spirits.&nbsp; Immediately 
afterwards he fell asleep, and I watched him anxiously until he 
awoke, being desirous of knowing the nature and extent of his 
wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he exclaimed, on awaking suddenly, after a 
slumber of an hour, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the better of that nap, 
Ralph; I feel twice the man I was;&rdquo; and he attempted to 
rise, but sank back again immediately with a deep groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Bill you must not move, but lie still while I look
at your wound.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll make a comfortable bed for you 
here on deck, and get you some breakfast.&nbsp; After that you 
shall tell me how you got it.&nbsp; Cheer up, Bill,&rdquo; I 
added, seeing that he turned his head away; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll 
be all right in a little, and I&rsquo;ll be a capital nurse to 
you though I&rsquo;m no doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I then left him, and lighted a fire in the caboose.&nbsp; 
While it was kindling, I went to the steward&rsquo;s pantry and 
procured the materials for a good breakfast, with which, in 
little more than half an hour, I returned to my companion.&nbsp; 
He seemed much better, and smiled kindly on me as I set before 
him a cup of coffee and a tray with several eggs and some bread 
on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, Bill,&rdquo; said I, cheerfully, sitting down
beside him on the deck, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s fall to.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;m very hungry myself, I can tell you; but&mdash;I 
forgot&mdash;your wound,&rdquo; I added, rising; &ldquo;let me 
look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found that the wound was caused by a pistol shot in the 
chest.&nbsp; It did not bleed much, and, as it was on the right 
side, I was in hopes that it might not be very serious.&nbsp; But
Bill shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;However,&rdquo; said he, 
&ldquo;sit down, Ralph, and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about 
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, after we left the boat an&rsquo; began to push
through the bushes, we went straight for the line of my musket, 
as I had expected; but by some unlucky chance it didn&rsquo;t 
explode, for I saw the line torn away by the men&rsquo;s legs, 
and heard the click o&rsquo; the lock; so I fancy the priming had
got damp and didn&rsquo;t catch.&nbsp; I was in a great quandary 
now what to do, for I couldn&rsquo;t concoct in my mind, in the 
hurry, any good reason for firin&rsquo; off my piece.&nbsp; But 
they say necessity&rsquo;s the mother of invention; so, just as I
was givin&rsquo; it up and clinchin&rsquo; my teeth to bide the 
worst o&rsquo;t, and take what should come, a sudden thought came
into my head.&nbsp; I stepped out before the rest, seemin&rsquo; 
to be awful anxious to be at the savages, tripped my foot on a 
fallen tree, plunged head foremost into a bush, an&rsquo;, ov 
coorse, my carbine exploded!&nbsp; Then came such a 
screechin&rsquo; from the camp as I never heard in all my 
life.&nbsp; I rose at once, and was rushin&rsquo; on with the 
rest when the captain called a halt.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p334b.jpg">
<img alt="The dying pirate" src="images/p334s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You did that a-purpose, you villain!&rsquo; he 
said, with a tremendous oath, and, drawin&rsquo; a pistol from 
his belt, let fly right into my breast.&nbsp; I fell at once, and
remembered no more till I was startled and brought round by the 
most awful yell I ever heard in my life, except, maybe, the 
shrieks o&rsquo; them poor critters that were crushed to death 
under yon big canoe.&nbsp; Jumpin&rsquo; up, I looked round, and,
through the trees, saw a fire gleamin&rsquo; not far off, the 
light o&rsquo; which showed me the captain and men tied hand and 
foot, each to a post, and the savages dancin&rsquo; round them 
like demons.&nbsp; I had scarce looked for a second, when I saw 
one o&rsquo; them go up to the captain flourishing a knife, and, 
before I could wink, he plunged it into his breast, while another
yell, like the one that roused me, rang upon my ear.&nbsp; I 
didn&rsquo;t wait for more, but, bounding up, went crashing 
through the bushes into the woods.&nbsp; The black fellows caught
sight of me, however, but not in time to prevent me jumpin&rsquo;
into the boat, as you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill seemed to be much exhausted after this recital, and 
shuddered frequently during the narrative, so I refrained from 
continuing the subject at that time, and endeavoured to draw his 
mind to other things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now, Bill,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it behoves us to 
think about the future, and what course of action we shall 
pursue.&nbsp; Here we are, on the wide Pacific, in a 
well-appointed schooner, which is our own,&mdash;at least no one 
has a better claim to it than we have,&mdash;and the world lies 
before us.&nbsp; Moreover, here comes a breeze, so we must make 
up our minds which way to steer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph, boy,&rdquo; said my companion, &ldquo;it matters
not to me which way we go.&nbsp; I fear that my time is short 
now.&nbsp; Go where you will.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, Bill, I think we had better steer to the 
Coral Island, and see what has become of my dear old comrades, 
Jack and Peterkin.&nbsp; I believe the island has no name, but 
the captain once pointed it out to me on the chart, and I marked 
it afterwards; so, as we know pretty well our position just now, 
I think I can steer to it.&nbsp; Then, as to working the vessel, 
it is true I cannot hoist the sails single-handed, but luckily we
have enough of sail set already, and if it should come on to blow
a squall, I could at least drop the peaks of the main and fore 
sails, and clew them up partially without help, and throw her 
head close into the wind, so as to keep her all shaking till the 
violence of the squall is past.&nbsp; And if we have continued 
light breezes, I&rsquo;ll rig up a complication of blocks and fix
them to the top-sail halyards, so that I shall be able to hoist 
the sails without help.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true I&rsquo;ll require 
half a day to hoist them, but we don&rsquo;t need to mind 
that.&nbsp; Then I&rsquo;ll make a sort of erection on deck to 
screen you from the sun, Bill; and if you can only manage to sit 
beside the tiller and steer for two hours every day, so as to let
me get a nap, I&rsquo;ll engage to let you off duty all the rest 
of the twenty-four hours.&nbsp; And if you don&rsquo;t feel able 
for steering, I&rsquo;ll lash the helm and heave to, while I get 
you your breakfasts and dinners; and so we&rsquo;ll manage 
famously, and soon reach the Coral Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill smiled faintly as I ran on in this strain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will you do,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if it 
comes on to blow a storm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This question silenced me, while I considered what I should do
in such a case.&nbsp; At length I laid my hand an his arm, and 
said, &ldquo;Bill, when a man has done all that he <i>can</i> do,
he ought to leave the rest to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ralph,&rdquo; said my companion, in a faint voice, 
looking anxiously into my face, &ldquo;I wish that I had the 
feelin&rsquo;s about God that you seem to have, at this 
hour.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m dyin&rsquo;, Ralph; yet I, who have braved 
death a hundred times, am afraid to die.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m afraid 
to enter the next world.&nbsp; Something within tells me there 
will be a reckoning when I go there.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s all 
over with me, Ralph.&nbsp; I feel that there&rsquo;s no chance 
o&rsquo; my bein&rsquo; saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, Bill,&rdquo; said I, in deep 
compassion, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m quite 
sure there&rsquo;s hope even for you, but I can&rsquo;t remember 
the words of the Bible that make me think so.&nbsp; Is there not 
a Bible on board, Bill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; the last that was in the ship belonged to a poor 
boy that was taken aboard against his will.&nbsp; He died, poor 
lad, I think, through ill treatment and fear.&nbsp; After he was 
gone the captain found his Bible and flung it 
overboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I now reflected, with great sadness and self-reproach, on the 
way in which I had neglected my Bible; and it flashed across me 
that I was actually in the sight of God a greater sinner than 
this blood-stained pirate; for, thought I, he tells me that he 
never read the Bible, and was never brought up to care for it; 
whereas I was carefully taught to read it by my own mother, and 
had read it daily as long as I possessed one, yet to so little 
purpose that I could not now call to mind a single text that 
would meet this poor man&rsquo;s case, and afford him the 
consolation he so much required.&nbsp; I was much distressed, and
taxed my memory for a long time.&nbsp; At last a text did flash 
into my mind, and I wondered much that I had not thought of it 
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill,&rdquo; said I, in a low voice, 
&ldquo;&lsquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be 
saved.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, Ralph, I&rsquo;ve heard the missionaries say that 
before now, but what good can it do me?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not for 
me that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not for the likes o&rsquo; 
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew not now what to say, for, although I felt sure that 
that word was for him as well as for me, I could not remember any
other word whereby I could prove it.</p>
<p>After a short pause, Bill raised his eyes to mine and said, 
&ldquo;Ralph, I&rsquo;ve led a terrible life.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve 
been a sailor since I was a boy, and I&rsquo;ve gone from bad to 
worse ever since I left my father&rsquo;s roof.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve 
been a pirate three years now.&nbsp; It is true I did not choose 
the trade, but I was inveigled aboard this schooner and kept here
by force till I became reckless and at last joined them.&nbsp; 
Since that time my hand has been steeped in human blood again and
again.&nbsp; Your young heart would grow cold if I&mdash;; but 
why should I go on?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis of no use, Ralph; my doom is
fixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;&lsquo;Though your sins be 
red like crimson, they shall be white as snow.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Only believe.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only believe!&rdquo; cried Bill, starting up on his 
elbow; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard men talk o&rsquo; believing as if 
it was easy.&nbsp; Ha! &rsquo;tis easy enough for a man to point 
to a rope and say, &lsquo;I believe that would bear my 
weight;&rsquo; but &rsquo;tis another thing for a man to catch 
hold o&rsquo; that rope, and swing himself by it over the edge of
a precipice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The energy with which he said this, and the action with which 
it was accompanied, were too much for Bill.&nbsp; He sank back 
with a deep groan.&nbsp; As if the very elements sympathized with
this man&rsquo;s sufferings, a low moan came sweeping over the 
sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist! Ralph,&rdquo; said Bill, opening his eves; 
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a squall coming, lad.&nbsp; Look alive, 
boy.&nbsp; Clew up the fore-sail.&nbsp; Drop the main-sail 
peak.&nbsp; Them squalls come quick sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had already started to my feet, and saw that a heavy squall 
was indeed bearing down on us.&nbsp; It had hitherto escaped my 
notice, owing to my being so much engrossed by our 
conversation.&nbsp; I instantly did as Bill desired, for the 
schooner was still lying motionless on the glassy sea.&nbsp; I 
observed with some satisfaction that the squall was bearing down 
on the larboard bow, so that it would strike the vessel in the 
position in which she would be best able to stand the 
shock.&nbsp; Having done my best to shorten sail, I returned aft,
and took my stand at the helm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boy,&rdquo; said Bill, in a faint voice, 
&ldquo;keep her close to the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few seconds afterwards he said, &ldquo;Ralph, let me hear 
those two texts again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I repeated them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are ye sure, lad, ye saw them in the Bible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite sure,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>Almost before the words had left my lips the wind burst upon 
us, and the spray dashed over our decks.&nbsp; For a time the 
schooner stood it bravely, and sprang forward against the rising 
sea like a war-horse.&nbsp; Meanwhile clouds darkened the sky, 
and the sea began to rise in huge billows.&nbsp; There was still 
too much sail on the schooner, and, as the gale increased, I 
feared that the masts would be torn out of her or carried away, 
while the wind whistled and shrieked through the strained 
rigging.&nbsp; Suddenly the wind shifted a point, a heavy sea 
struck us on the bow, and the schooner was almost laid on her 
beam-ends, so that I could scarcely keep my legs.&nbsp; At the 
same moment Bill lost his hold of the belaying-pin which had 
served to steady him, and he slid with stunning violence against 
the sky-light.&nbsp; As he lay on the deck close beside me, I 
could see that the shock had rendered him insensible, but I did 
not dare to quit the tiller for an instant, as it required all my
faculties, bodily and mental, to manage the schooner.&nbsp; For 
an hour the blast drove us along, while, owing to the sharpness 
of the vessel&rsquo;s bow and the press of canvass, she dashed 
through the waves instead of breasting over them, thereby 
drenching the decks with water fore and aft.&nbsp; At the end of 
that time the squall passed away, and left us rocking on the 
bosom of the agitated sea.</p>
<p>My first care, the instant I could quit the helm, was to raise
Bill from the deck and place him on the couch.&nbsp; I then ran 
below for the brandy bottle and rubbed his face and hands with 
it, and endeavoured to pour a little down his throat.&nbsp; But 
my efforts, although I continued them long and assiduously, were 
of no avail; as I let go the hand which I had been chafing it 
fell heavily on the deck.&nbsp; I laid my hand over his heart, 
and sat for some time quite motionless, but there was no flutter 
there&mdash;the pirate was dead!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
<p>Alone on the deep&mdash;Necessity the mother of 
invention&mdash;A valuable book discovered&mdash;Natural 
phenomenon&mdash;A bright day in my history.</p>
<p>It was with feelings of awe, not unmingled with fear, that I 
now seated myself on the cabin sky-light and gazed upon the rigid
features of my late comrade, while my mind wandered over his past
history and contemplated with anxiety my present position.&nbsp; 
Alone! in the midst of the wide Pacific, having a most imperfect 
knowledge of navigation, and in a schooner requiring at least 
eight men as her proper crew.&nbsp; But I will not tax the 
reader&rsquo;s patience with a minute detail of my feelings and 
doings during the first few days that followed the death of my 
companion.&nbsp; I will merely mention that I tied a cannon ball 
to his feet and, with feelings of the deepest sorrow, consigned 
him to the deep.</p>
<p>For fully a week after that a steady breeze blew from the 
east, and, as my course lay west-and-by-north, I made rapid 
progress towards my destination.&nbsp; I could not take an 
observation, which I very much regretted, as the captain&rsquo;s 
quadrant was in the cabin; but, from the day of setting sail from
the island of the savages, I had kept a dead reckoning, and as I 
knew pretty well now how much lee-way the schooner made, I hoped 
to hit the Coral Island without much difficulty.&nbsp; In this I 
was the more confident that I knew its position on the chart 
(which I understood was a very good one), and so had its correct 
bearings by compass.</p>
<p>As the weather seemed now quite settled and fine, and as I had
got into the trade-winds, I set about preparations for hoisting 
the top-sails.&nbsp; This was a most arduous task, and my first 
attempts were complete failures, owing, in a great degree, to my 
reprehensible ignorance of mechanical forces.&nbsp; The first 
error I made was in applying my apparatus of blocks and pulleys 
to a rope which was too weak, so that the very first heave I made
broke it in two, and sent me staggering against the after-hatch, 
over which I tripped, and, striking against the main-boom, 
tumbled down the companion ladder into the cabin.&nbsp; I was 
much bruised and somewhat stunned by this untoward 
accident.&nbsp; However, I considered it fortunate that I was not
killed.&nbsp; In my next attempt I made sure of not coming by a 
similar accident, so I unreeved the tackling and fitted up larger
blocks and ropes.&nbsp; But although the principle on which I 
acted was quite correct, the machinery was now so massive and 
heavy that the mere friction and stiffness of the thick cordage 
prevented me from moving it at all.&nbsp; Afterwards, however, I 
came to proportion things more correctly; but I could not avoid 
reflecting at the time how much better it would have been had I 
learned all this from observation and study, instead of waiting 
till I was forced to acquire it through the painful and tedious 
lessons of experience.</p>
<p>After the tackling was prepared and in good working order, it 
took me the greater part of a day to hoist the main-top 
sail.&nbsp; As I could not steer and work at this at the same 
time, I lashed the helm in such a position that, with a little 
watching now and then, it kept the schooner in her proper 
course.&nbsp; By this means I was enabled also to go about the 
deck and down below for things that I wanted, as occasion 
required; also to cook and eat my victuals.&nbsp; But I did not 
dare to trust to this plan during the three hours of rest that I 
allowed myself at night, as the wind might have shifted, in which
case I should have been blown far out of my course ere I 
awoke.&nbsp; I was, therefore, in the habit of heaving-to during 
those three hours; that is, fixing the rudder and the sails in 
such a position as that by acting against each other, they would 
keep the ship stationary.&nbsp; After my night&rsquo;s rest, 
therefore, I had only to make allowance for the lee-way she had 
made, and so resume my course.</p>
<p>Of course I was to some extent anxious lest another squall 
should come, but I made the best provision I could in the 
circumstances, and concluded that by letting go the 
weather-braces of the top-sails and the top-sail halyards at the 
same time, I should thereby render these sails almost 
powerless.&nbsp; Besides this, I proposed to myself to keep a 
sharp look-out on the barometer in the cabin, and if I observed 
at any time a sudden fall in it, I resolved that I would 
instantly set about my multiform appliances for reducing sail, so
as to avoid being taken at unawares.&nbsp; Thus I sailed 
prosperously for two weeks, with a fair wind, so that I 
calculated I must be drawing near to the Coral Island; at the 
thought of which my heart bounded with joyful expectation.</p>
<p>The only book I found on board, after a careful search, was a 
volume of Captain Cook&rsquo;s voyages.&nbsp; This, I suppose, 
the pirate captain had brought with him in order to guide him, 
and to furnish him with information regarding the islands of 
these seas.&nbsp; I found this a most delightful book indeed, and
I not only obtained much interesting knowledge about the sea in 
which I was sailing, but I had many of my own opinions, derived 
from experience, corroborated; and not a few of them 
corrected.&nbsp; Besides the reading of this charming book, and 
the daily routine of occupations, nothing of particular note 
happened to me during this voyage, except once, when on rising 
one night, after my three hours&rsquo; nap, while it was yet 
dark, I was amazed and a little alarmed to find myself floating 
in what appeared to be a sea of blue fire!&nbsp; I had often 
noticed the beautiful appearance of phosphorescent light, but 
this far exceeded anything of the sort I ever saw before.&nbsp; 
The whole sea appeared somewhat like milk and was remarkably 
luminous.</p>
<p>I rose in haste, and, letting down a bucket into the sea, 
brought some of the water on board and took it down to the cabin 
to examine it; but no sooner did I approach the light than the 
strange appearance disappeared, and when I removed the cabin lamp
the luminous light appeared again.&nbsp; I was much puzzled with 
this, and took up a little of the water in the hollow of my hand 
and then let it run off, when I found that the luminous substance
was left behind on my palm.&nbsp; I ran with it to the lamp; but 
when I got there it was gone.&nbsp; I found, however, that when I
went into the dark my hand shone again; so I took the large glass
of the ship&rsquo;s telescope and examined my hand minutely, when
I found that there were on it one or two small patches of a 
clear, transparent substance like jelly, which were so thin as to
be almost invisible to the naked eye.&nbsp; Thus I came to know 
that the beautiful phosphoric light, which I had so often admired
before, was caused by animals, for I had no doubt that these were
of the same kind as the medusae or jelly-fish which are seen in 
all parts of the world.</p>
<p>On the evening of my fourteenth day, I was awakened out of a 
nap into which I had fallen by a loud cry, and starting up, I 
gazed around me.&nbsp; I was surprised and delighted to see a 
large albatross soaring majestically over the ship.&nbsp; I 
immediately took it into my head that this was the albatross I 
had seen at Penguin Island.&nbsp; I had, of course, no good 
reason for supposing this, but the idea occurred to me, I know 
not why, and I cherished it, and regarded the bird with as much 
affection as if he had been an old friend.&nbsp; He kept me 
company all that day and left me as night fell.</p>
<p>Next morning as I stood motionless and with heavy eyes at the 
helm, for I had not slept well, I began to weary anxiously for 
day-light, and peered towards the horizon, where I thought I 
observed something like a black cloud against the dark sky.&nbsp;
Being always on the alert for squalls, I ran to the bow.&nbsp; 
There could be no doubt it was a squall, and as I listened I 
thought I heard the murmur of the coming gale.&nbsp; Instantly I 
began to work might and main at my cumbrous tackle for shortening
sail, and in the course of an hour and a half had the most of it 
reduced,&mdash;the top-sail yards down on the caps, the top-sails
clewed up, the sheets hauled in, the main and fore peaks lowered,
and the flying-jib down.&nbsp; While thus engaged the dawn 
advanced, and I cast an occasional furtive glance ahead in the 
midst of my labour.&nbsp; But now that things were prepared for 
the worst, I ran forward again and looked anxiously over the 
bow.&nbsp; I now heard the roar of the waves distinctly, and as a
single ray of the rising sun gleamed over the ocean I 
saw&mdash;what! could it be that I was dreaming?&mdash;that 
magnificent breaker with its ceaseless roar!&mdash;that mountain 
top!&mdash;yes, once more I beheld the Coral Island!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
<p>The effect of a cannon-shot&mdash;A happy reunion of a 
somewhat moist nature&mdash;Retrospects and explanations&mdash;An
awful dive&mdash;New plans&mdash;The last of the Coral 
Island.</p>
<p>I almost fell upon the deck with the tumult of mingled 
emotions that filled my heart, as I gazed ardently towards my 
beautiful island.&nbsp; It was still many miles away, but 
sufficiently near to enable me to trace distinctly the 
well-remembered outlines of the two mountains.&nbsp; My first 
impulse was to utter an exclamation of gratitude for being 
carried to my former happy home in safety; my second, to jump up,
clap my hands, shout, and run up and down the deck, with no other
object in view than that of giving vent to my excited 
feelings.&nbsp; Then I went below for the telescope, and spent 
nearly ten minutes of the utmost impatience in vainly trying to 
get a focus, and in rubbing the skin nearly off my eyes, before I
discovered that having taken off the large glass to examine the 
phosphoric water with I had omitted to put it on again.</p>
<p>After that I looked up impatiently at the sails, which I now 
regretted having lowered so hastily, and for a moment thought of 
hoisting the main-top sail again; but recollecting that it would 
take me full half a day to accomplish, and that, at the present 
rate of sailing, two hours would bring me to the island, I 
immediately dismissed the idea.</p>
<p>The remainder of the time I spent in making feverish 
preparations for arriving and seeing my dear comrades.&nbsp; I 
remembered that they were not in the habit of rising before six, 
and, as it was now only three, I hoped to arrive before they were
awake.&nbsp; Moreover, I set about making ready to let go the 
anchor, resolving in my own mind that, as I knew the depth of 
water in the passage of the reef and within the lagoon, I would 
run the schooner in and bring up opposite the bower.&nbsp; 
Fortunately the anchor was hanging at the cat-head, otherwise I 
should never have been able to use it.&nbsp; Now, I had only to 
cut the tackling, and it would drop of its own weight.&nbsp; 
After searching among the flags, I found the terrible black one, 
which I ran up to the peak.&nbsp; While I was doing this, a 
thought struck me.&nbsp; I went to the powder magazine, brought 
up a blank cartridge and loaded the big brass gun, which, it will
be remembered, was unhoused when we set sail, and, as I had no 
means of housing it, there it had stood, bristling alike at fair 
weather and foul all the voyage.&nbsp; I took care to grease its 
mouth well, and, before leaving the fore part of the ship, thrust
the poker into the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p352b.jpg">
<img alt="A terrible surprise" src="images/p352s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>All was now ready.&nbsp; A steady five-knot breeze was 
blowing, so that I was now not more than quarter of a mile from 
the reef.&nbsp; I was soon at the entrance, and, as the schooner 
glided quietly through, I glanced affectionately at the huge 
breaker, as if it had been the same one I had seen there when I 
bade adieu, as I feared for ever, to the island.&nbsp; On coming 
opposite the Water Garden, I put the helm hard down.&nbsp; The 
schooner came round with a rapid, graceful bend, and lost way 
just opposite the bower.&nbsp; Running forward, I let go the 
anchor, caught up the red-hot poker, applied it to the brass gun,
and the mountains with a <i>bang</i>, such as had only once 
before broke their slumbering echoes!</p>
<p>Effective although it was, however, it was scarcely equal to 
the bang with which, instantly after, Peterkin bounded from the 
bower, in scanty costume, his eye-balls starting from his head 
with surprise and terror.&nbsp; One gaze he gave, one yell, and 
then fled into the bushes like a wild cat.&nbsp; The next moment 
Jack went through exactly the same performance, the only 
difference being, that his movements were less like those of 
Jack-in-the-box, though not less vigorous and rapid than those of
Peterkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; I shouted, almost mad with joy, 
&ldquo;what, ho! Peterkin!&nbsp; Jack! hallo! it&rsquo;s 
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My shout was just in time to arrest them.&nbsp; They halted 
and turned round, and, the instant I repeated the cry, I saw that
they recognised my voice, by both of them running at full speed 
towards the beach.&nbsp; I could no longer contain myself.&nbsp; 
Throwing off my jacket, I jumped overboard at the same moment 
that Jack bounded into the sea.&nbsp; In another moment we met in
deep water, clasped each other round the neck, and sank, as a 
matter of course, to the bottom!&nbsp; We were well-nigh choked, 
and instantly struggled to the surface, where Peterkin was 
spluttering about like a wounded duck, laughing and crying by 
turns, and choking himself with salt water!</p>
<p>It would be impossible to convey to my reader, by description,
an adequate conception of the scene that followed my landing on 
the beach, as we stood embracing each other indiscriminately in 
our dripping garments, and giving utterance to incoherent 
rhapsodies, mingled with wild shouts.&nbsp; It can be more easily
imagined than described, so I will draw a curtain over this part 
of my history, and carry the reader forward over an interval of 
three days.</p>
<p>During the greater part of that period Peterkin did nothing 
but roast pigs, taro, and bread-fruit, and ply me with plantains,
plums, potatoes, and cocoa-nuts, while I related to him and Jack 
the terrible and wonderful adventures I had gone through since we
last met.&nbsp; After I had finished the account, they made me go
all over it again; and, when I had concluded the second recital, 
I had to go over it again, while they commented upon it 
piecemeal.&nbsp; They were much affected by what I told them of 
the probable fate of Avatea, and Peterkin could by no means brook
the idea of the poor girl being converted into a <i>long 
pig</i>!&nbsp; As for Jack, he clenched his teeth, and shook his 
fist towards the sea, saying at the same time, that he was sorry 
he had not broken Tararo&rsquo;s head, and he only hoped that one
day he should be able to plant his knuckles on the bridge of that
chief&rsquo;s nose!&nbsp; After they had &ldquo;pumped me 
dry,&rdquo; as Peterkin said, I begged to be informed of what had
happened to them during my long absence, and particularly as to 
how they got out of the Diamond Cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you must know,&rdquo; began Jack, &ldquo;after 
you had dived out of the cave, on the day you were taken away 
from us, we waited very patiently for half an hour, not expecting
you to return before the end of that time.&nbsp; Then we began to
upbraid you for staying so long, when you knew we would be 
anxious; but when an hour passed, we became alarmed, and I 
resolved at all hazards to dive out, and see what had become of 
you, although I felt for poor Peterkin, because, as he truly 
said, &lsquo;If you never come back, I&rsquo;m shut up here for 
life.&rsquo;&nbsp; However, I promised not to run any risk, and 
he let me go; which, to say truth, I thought very courageous of 
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should just think it was!&rdquo; interrupted 
Peterkin, looking at Jack over the edge of a monstrous potato 
which he happened to be devouring at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Jack, &ldquo;you may guess my 
consternation when you did not answer to my halloo.&nbsp; At 
first I imagined that the pirates must have killed you, and left 
you in the bush, or thrown you into the sea; then it occurred to 
me that this would have served no end of theirs, so I came to the
conclusion that they must have carried you away with them.&nbsp; 
As this thought struck me, I observed the pirate schooner 
standing away to the nor&rsquo;ard, almost hull-down on the 
horizon, and I sat down on the rocks to watch her as she slowly 
sank from my sight.&nbsp; And I tell you, Ralph, my boy, that I 
shed more tears that time, at losing you, than I have done, I 
verify believe, all my life before&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Jack, for interrupting,&rdquo; said 
Peterkin; &ldquo;surely you must be mistaken in that; 
you&rsquo;ve often told me that, when you were a baby, you used 
to howl and roar from morning to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, Peterkin,&rdquo; cried Jack.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Well, after the schooner had disappeared, I dived back 
into the cave, much to Peterkin&rsquo;s relief, and told him what
I had seen.&nbsp; We sat down and had a long talk over this 
matter, and then we agreed to make a regular, systematic search 
through the woods, so as to make sure, at least, that you had not
been killed.&nbsp; But now we thought of the difficulty of 
getting out of the cave without your help.&nbsp; Peterkin became 
dreadfully nervous when he thought of this; and I must confess 
that I felt some alarm, for, of course, I could not hope alone to
take him out so quickly as we two together had brought him in; 
and he himself vowed that, if we had been a moment longer with 
him that time, he would have had to take a breath of salt 
water.&nbsp; However, there was no help for it, and I endeavoured
to calm his fears as well as I could: &lsquo;for,&rsquo; said I, 
&lsquo;you can&rsquo;t live here, Peterkin;&rsquo; to which he 
replied, &lsquo;Of course not, Jack, I can only die here, and, as
that&rsquo;s not at all desirable, you had better propose 
something.&rsquo;&nbsp; So I suggested that he should take a good
long breath, and trust himself to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Might we not make a large bag of cocoa-nut 
cloth, into which I could shove my head, and tie it tight round 
my neck?&rsquo; he asked, with a haggard smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;It 
might let me get one breath under water!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No use,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;it would fill in a
moment and suffocate you.&nbsp; I see nothing for it, Peterkin, 
if you really can&rsquo;t keep your breath so long, but to let me
knock you down, and carry you out while in a state of 
insensibility.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Peterkin didn&rsquo;t relish this idea.&nbsp; He 
seemed to fear that I could not be able to measure the exact 
force of the blow, and might, on the one hand, hit him so softly 
as to render a second or third blow necessary, which would be 
very uncomfortable; or, on the other hand, give him such a smash 
as would entirely spoil his figure-head, or, mayhap, knock the 
life out of him altogether!&nbsp; At last I got him persuaded to 
try to hold his breath, and commit himself to me; so he agreed, 
and down we went.&nbsp; But I had not got him half way through, 
when he began to struggle and kick like a wild bull, burst from 
my grasp, and hit against the roof of the tunnel.&nbsp; I was 
therefore, obliged to force him violently back into the cave 
gain, where he rose panting to the surface.&nbsp; In short, he 
had lost his presence of mind, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort,&rdquo; cried Peterkin, 
indignantly, &ldquo;I had only lost my wind; and if I had not had
presence of mind enough to kick as I did, I should have 
bu&rsquo;st in your arms!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, so be it,&rdquo; resumed Jack, with a 
smile, &ldquo;but the upshot of it was, that we had to hold 
another consultation on the point, and I really believe that, had
it not been for a happy thought of mine, we should have been 
consulting there yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we had,&rdquo; again interrupted Peterkin with a
sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, Ralph, if I had thought that 
you were coming back again, I would willingly have awaited your 
return for months, rather than have endured the mental agony 
which I went through!&nbsp; But proceed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thought was this,&rdquo; continued Jack, 
&ldquo;that I should tie Peterkin&rsquo;s hands and feet with 
cords, and then lash him firmly to a stout pole about five feet 
long, in order to render him quite powerless, and keep him 
straight and stiff.&nbsp; You should have seen his face of 
horror, Ralph, when I suggested this: but he came to see that it 
was his only chance, and told me to set about it as fast as I 
could; &lsquo;for,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;this is no 
jokin&rsquo;, Jack, <i>I</i> can tell you, and the sooner 
it&rsquo;s done the better.&rsquo;&nbsp; I soon procured the 
cordage and a suitable pole, with which I returned to the cave, 
and lashed him as stiff and straight as an Egyptian mummy; and, 
to say truth, he was no bad representation of what an English 
mummy would be, if there were such things, for he was as white as
a dead man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Peterkin, in a tremulous voice,
&lsquo;swim with me as near to the edge of the hole as you can 
before you dive, then let me take a long breath, and, as I 
sha&rsquo;nt be able to speak after I&rsquo;ve taken it, 
you&rsquo;ll watch my face, and the moment you see me 
wink&mdash;dive!&nbsp; And oh!&rsquo; he added, earnestly, 
&lsquo;pray don&rsquo;t be long!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised to pay the strictest attention to his 
wishes, and swam with him to the outlet of the cave.&nbsp; Here I
paused.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now then,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;pull away at
the wind, lad.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peterkin drew in a breath so long that I could not help 
thinking of the frog in the fable, that wanted to swell itself as
big as the ox.&nbsp; Then I looked into his face earnestly.&nbsp;
Slap went the lid of his right eye; down went my head, and up 
went my heels.&nbsp; We shot through the passage like an arrow, 
and rose to the surface of the open sea before you could count 
twenty!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peterkin had taken in such an awful load of wind that, 
on reaching the free air, he let it out with a yell loud enough 
to have been heard a mile off, and then, the change in his 
feelings was so sudden and great, that he did not wait till we 
landed, but began, tied up as he was, to shout and sing for joy 
as I supported him with my left arm to the shore.&nbsp; However, 
in the middle of a laugh that a hyaena might have envied, I let 
him accidentally slip, which extinguished him in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this happy deliverance, we immediately began our 
search for your dead body, Ralph, and you have no idea how low 
our hearts sank as we set off, day after day, to examine the 
valleys and mountain sides with the utmost care.&nbsp; In about 
three weeks we completed the survey of the whole island, and had 
at least the satisfaction of knowing that you had not been 
killed.&nbsp; But it occurred to us that you might have been 
thrown into the sea, so we examined the sands and the lagoon 
carefully, and afterwards went all round the outer reef.&nbsp; 
One day, while we were upon the reef, Peterkin espied a small 
dark object lying among the rocks, which seemed to be quite 
different from the surrounding stones.&nbsp; We hastened towards 
the spot, and found it to be a small keg.&nbsp; On knocking out 
the head we discovered that it was gunpowder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was I who sent you that, Jack,&rdquo; said I, with a
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fork out!&rdquo; cried Peterkin, energetically, 
starting to his feet and extending his open hand to Jack.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Down with the money, sir, else I&rsquo;ll have you shut up
for life in a debtor&rsquo;s prison the moment we return to 
England!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you an I.O.U. in the meantime,&rdquo; 
returned Jack, laughing, &ldquo;so sit down and be quiet.&nbsp; 
The fact is, Ralph, when we discovered this keg of powder, 
Peterkin immediately took me a bet of a thousand pounds that you 
had something to do with it, and I took him a bet of ten thousand
that you had not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peterkin was right then,&rdquo; said I, explaining how 
the thing had occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we found it very useful,&rdquo; continued Jack; 
&ldquo;although some of it had got a little damp; and we 
furbished up the old pistol, with which Peterkin is a crack shot 
now.&nbsp; But, to continue.&nbsp; We did not find any other 
vestige of you on the reef, and, finally, gave up all hope of 
ever seeing you again.&nbsp; After this the island became a 
dreary place to us, and we began to long for a ship to heave in 
sight and take us off.&nbsp; But now that you&rsquo;re back 
again, my dear fellow, it looks as bright and cheerful as it used
to do, and I love it as much as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; continued Jack, &ldquo;I have a great 
desire to visit some of the other islands of the South 
Seas.&nbsp; Here we have a first-rate schooner at our disposal, 
so I don&rsquo;t see what should hinder us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the very thing I was going to propose,&rdquo; 
cried Peterkin; &ldquo;I vote for starting at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;it seems to me 
that we could not do better than shape our course for the island 
on which Avatea lives, and endeavour to persuade Tararo to let 
her marry the black fellow to whom she is engaged, instead of 
making a long pig of her.&nbsp; If he has a spark of gratitude in
him he&rsquo;ll do it.&nbsp; Besides, having become champions for
this girl once before, it behoves us, as true knights, not to 
rest until we set her free; at least, all the heroes in all the 
story-books I have ever read would count it foul disgrace to 
leave such a work unfinished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know, or care, what your 
knights in story-books would do,&rdquo; said Peterkin, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m certain that it would be capital fun, so I&rsquo;m your
man whenever you want me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This plan of Jack&rsquo;s was quite in accordance with his 
romantic, impulsive nature; and, having made up his mind to save 
this black girl, he could not rest until the thing was 
commenced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there may be great danger in this attempt,&rdquo; 
he said, at the end of a long consultation on the subject; 
&ldquo;will you, lads, go with me in spite of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go with you?&rdquo; we repeated in the same breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you doubt it?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a moment,&rdquo; added Peterkin.</p>
<p>I need scarcely say that, having made up our minds to go on 
this enterprise, we lost no time in making preparations to quit 
the island; and as the schooner was well laden with stores of 
every kind for a long cruise, we had little to do except to add 
to our abundant supply a quantity of cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, 
taro, yams, plums, and potatoes, chiefly with the view of 
carrying the fragrance of our dear island along with us as long 
as we could.</p>
<p>When all was ready, we paid a farewell visit to the different 
familiar spots where most of our time had been spent.&nbsp; We 
ascended the mountain top, and gazed for the last time at the 
rich green foliage in the valleys, the white sandy beach, the 
placid lagoon, and the barrier coral-reef with its crested 
breakers.&nbsp; Then we descended to Spouting Cliff, and looked 
down at the pale-green monster which we had made such fruitless 
efforts to spear in days gone by.&nbsp; From this we hurried to 
the Water Garden and took a last dive into its clear waters, and 
a last gambol amongst its coral groves.&nbsp; I hurried out 
before my companions, and dressed in haste, in order to have a 
long examination of my tank, which Peterkin, in the fulness of 
his heart, had tended with the utmost care, as being a vivid 
remembrancer of me, rather than out of love for natural 
history.&nbsp; It was in superb condition;&mdash;the water as 
clear and pellucid as crystal; the red and green sea-weed of the 
most brilliant hues; the red, purple, yellow, green, and striped 
anemones fully expanded, and stretching out their arms as if to 
welcome and embrace their former master; the starfish, zoophytes,
sea-pens, and other innumerable marine insects, looking fresh and
beautiful; and the crabs, as Peterkin said, looking as wide 
awake, impertinent, rampant, and pugnacious as ever.&nbsp; It was
indeed so lovely and so interesting that I would scarcely allow 
myself to be torn away from it.</p>
<p>Last of all, we returned to the bower and collected the few 
articles we possessed, such as the axe, the pencil-case, the 
broken telescope, the pen-knife, the hook made from the brass 
ring, and the sail-needle, with which we had landed on the 
island;&mdash;also, the long boots and the pistol, besides 
several curious articles of costume which we had manufactured 
from time to time.</p>
<p>These we conveyed on board in our little boat, after having 
carved our names on a chip of iron-wood, thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>JACK MARTIN,<br />
RALPH ROVER,<br />
PETERKIN GAY,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which we fixed up inside of the bower.&nbsp; The boat was then
hoisted on board and the anchor weighed; which latter operation 
cost us great labour and much time, as the anchor was so heavy 
that we could not move it without the aid of my complex machinery
of blocks and pulleys.&nbsp; A steady breeze was blowing off 
shore when we set sail, at a little before sunset.&nbsp; It swept
us quickly past the reef and out to sea.&nbsp; The shore grew 
rapidly more indistinct as the shades of evening fell, while our 
clipper bark bounded lightly over the waves.&nbsp; Slowly the 
mountain top sank on the horizon, until it became a mere 
speck.&nbsp; In another moment the sun and the Coral Island sank 
together into the broad bosom of the Pacific.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
<p>The voyage&mdash;The island, and a consultation in which 
danger is scouted as a thing unworthy of consideration&mdash;Rats
and cats&mdash;The native teacher&mdash;Awful 
revelations&mdash;Wonderful effects of Christianity.</p>
<p>Our voyage during the next two weeks was most interesting and 
prosperous.&nbsp; The breeze continued generally fair, and at all
times enabled us to lie our course; for being, as I have said 
before, clipper-built, the pirate schooner could lie very close 
to the wind, and made little lee-way.&nbsp; We had no difficulty 
now in managing our sails, for Jack was heavy and powerful, while
Peterkin was active as a kitten.&nbsp; Still, however, we were a 
very insufficient crew for such a vessel, and if any one had 
proposed to us to make such a voyage in it before we had been 
forced to go through so many hardships from necessity, we would 
have turned away with pity from the individual making such 
proposal as from a madman.&nbsp; I pondered this a good deal, and
at last concluded that men do not know how much they are capable 
of doing till they try, and that we should never give way to 
despair in any undertaking, however difficult it may 
seem:&mdash;always supposing, however, that our cause is a good 
one, and that we can ask the divine blessing on it.</p>
<p>Although, therefore, we could now manage our sails easily, we 
nevertheless found that my pulleys were of much service to us in 
some things; though Jack did laugh heartily at the uncouth 
arrangement of ropes and blocks, which had, to a sailor&rsquo;s 
eye, a very lumbering and clumsy appearance.&nbsp; But I will not
drag my reader through the details of this voyage.&nbsp; Suffice 
it to say, that, after an agreeable sail of about three weeks, we
arrived off the island of Mango, which I recognised at once from 
the description that the pirate, Bill, had given me of it during 
one of our conversations.</p>
<p>As soon as we came within sight of it we hove the ship to, and
held a council of war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; said Jack, as we seated ourselves 
beside him on the cabin sky-light, &ldquo;before we go farther in
this business, we must go over the pros and cons of it; for, 
although you have so generously consented to stick by me through 
thick and thin, it would be unfair did I not see that you 
thoroughly understand the danger of what we are about to 
attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! bother the danger,&rdquo; cried Peterkin; &ldquo;I 
wonder to hear <i>you</i>, Jack, talk of danger.&nbsp; When a 
fellow begins to talk about it, he&rsquo;ll soon come to magnify 
it to such a degree that he&rsquo;ll not be fit to face it when 
it comes, no more than a suckin&rsquo; baby!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Peterkin,&rdquo; replied Jack, gravely, &ldquo;I 
won&rsquo;t be jested out of it.&nbsp; I grant you, that, when 
we&rsquo;ve once resolved to act, and have made up our minds what
to do, we should think no more of danger.&nbsp; But, before we 
have so resolved, it behoves us to look at it straight in the 
face, and examine into it, and walk round it; for if we flinch at
a distant view, we&rsquo;re sure to run away when the danger is 
near.&nbsp; Now, I understand from you, Ralph, that the island is
inhabited by thorough-going, out-and-out cannibals, whose 
principal law is&mdash;&lsquo;Might is right, and the weakest 
goes to the wall?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;so Bill gave me to 
understand.&nbsp; He told me, however, that, at the southern side
of it, the missionaries had obtained a footing amongst an 
insignificant tribe.&nbsp; A native teacher had been sent there 
by the Wesleyans, who had succeeded in persuading the chief at 
that part to embrace Christianity.&nbsp; But instead of that 
being of any advantage to our enterprise, it seems the very 
reverse; for the chief Tararo is a determined heathen, and 
persecutes the Christians,&mdash;who are far too weak in numbers 
to offer any resistance,&mdash;and looks with dislike upon all 
white men, whom he regards as propagators of the new 
faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a pity,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;that the 
Christian tribe is so small, for we shall scarcely be safe under 
their protection, I fear.&nbsp; If Tararo takes it into his head 
to wish for our vessel, or to kill ourselves, he could take us 
from them by force.&nbsp; You say that the native missionary 
talks English?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, what I propose is this,&rdquo; said Jack: 
&ldquo;We will run round to the south side of the island, and cut
anchor off the Christian village.&nbsp; We are too far away just 
now to have been descried by any of the savages, so we shall get 
there unobserved, and have time to arrange our plans before the 
heathen tribes know of our presence.&nbsp; But, in doing this, we
run the risk of being captured by the ill-disposed tribes, and 
being very ill used, if not&mdash;a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roasted alive and eaten,&rdquo; cried Peterkin.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Come, out with it, Jack; according to your own showing, 
it&rsquo;s well to look the danger straight in the 
face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that is the worst of it, certainly.&nbsp; Are you
prepared, then, to take your chance of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been prepared and had my mind made up long 
ago,&rdquo; cried Peterkin, swaggering about the deck with his 
hands thrust into his breeches&rsquo; pockets.&nbsp; &ldquo;The 
fact is, Jack, I don&rsquo;t believe that Tararo will be so 
ungrateful as to eat us; and I&rsquo;m quite sure that 
he&rsquo;ll be too happy to grant us whatever we ask: so the 
sooner we go in and win the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peterkin was wrong, however, in his estimate of savage 
gratitude, as the sequel will show.</p>
<p>The schooner was now put before the wind, and, after making a 
long run to the south&rsquo;ard, we put about and beat up for the
south side of Mango, where we arrived before sunset, and hove-to 
off the coral reef.&nbsp; Here we awaited the arrival of a canoe,
which immediately put off on our rounding to.&nbsp; When it 
arrived, a mild-looking native, of apparently forty years of age,
came on board, and, taking off his straw hat, made us a low 
bow.&nbsp; He was clad in a respectable suit of European clothes;
and the first words he uttered, as he stepped up to Jack and 
shook hands with him, were,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day, gentlemen; we are happy to see you at 
Mango&mdash;you are heartily welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After returning his salutation, Jack exclaimed, &ldquo;You 
must be the native missionary teacher of whom I have 
heard&mdash;are you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am.&nbsp; I have the joy to be a servant of the Lord 
Jesus at this station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the very man I want to see, then,&rdquo; 
replied Jack; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s lucky.&nbsp; Come down to the 
cabin, friend, and have a glass of wine.&nbsp; I wish 
particularly to speak with you.&nbsp; My men there&rdquo; 
(pointing to Peterkin and me) &ldquo;will look after your 
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the teacher, as he followed Jack
to the cabin, &ldquo;I do not drink wine or any strong 
drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! then, there&rsquo;s lots of water, and you can have
biscuit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, &rsquo;pon my word, that&rsquo;s cool!&rdquo; said
Peterkin; &ldquo;his <i>men</i>, forsooth!&nbsp; Well, since we 
are to be men, we may as well come it as strong over these black 
chaps as we can.&nbsp; Hallo, there!&rdquo; he cried to the half 
dozen of natives who stood upon the deck, gazing in wonder at all
they saw, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s for you;&rdquo; and he handed them 
a tray of broken biscuit and a can of water.&nbsp; Then, 
thrusting his hands into his pockets, he walked up and down the 
deck with an enormous swagger, whistling vociferously.</p>
<p>In about half an hour Jack and the teacher came on deck, and 
the latter, bidding us a cheerful good evening, entered his canoe
and paddled to the shore.&nbsp; When he was gone, Peterkin 
stepped up to Jack, and, touching his cap, said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, captain, have you any communications to make to 
your <i>men</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Jack; &ldquo;ready about, mind the 
helm and clew up your tongue, while I con the schooner through 
the passage in the reef.&nbsp; The teacher, who seems a 
first-rate fellow, says it&rsquo;s quite deep, and good anchorage
within the lagoon close to the shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the vessel was slowly advancing to her anchorage, under 
a light breeze, Jack explained to us that Avatea was still on the
island, living amongst the heathens; that she had expressed a 
strong desire to join the Christians, but Tararo would not let 
her, and kept her constantly in close confinement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moreover,&rdquo; continued Jack, &ldquo;I find that she
belongs to one of the Samoan Islands, where Christianity had been
introduced long before her capture by the heathens of a 
neighbouring island; and the very day after she was taken, she 
was to have joined the church which had been planted there by 
that excellent body, the London Missionary Society.&nbsp; The 
teacher tells me, too, that the poor girl has fallen in love with
a Christian chief, who lives on an island some fifty miles or so 
to the south of this one, and that she is meditating a desperate 
attempt at escape.&nbsp; So, you see, we have come in the nick of
time.&nbsp; I fancy that this chief is the fellow whom you heard 
of, Ralph, at the Island of Emo.&nbsp; Besides all this, the 
heathen savages are at war among themselves, and there&rsquo;s to
be a battle fought the day after to-morrow, in which the 
principal leader is Tararo; so that we&rsquo;ll not be able to 
commence our negotiations with the rascally chief till the day 
after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The village off which we anchored was beautifully situated at 
the head of a small bay, from the margin of which trees of every 
description peculiar to the tropics rose in the richest 
luxuriance to the summit of a hilly ridge, which was the line of 
demarcation between the possessions of the Christians and those 
of the neighbouring heathen chief.</p>
<p>The site of the settlement was an extensive plot of flat land,
stretching in a gentle slope from the sea to the mountain.&nbsp; 
The cottages stood several hundred yards from the beach, and were
protected from the glare of the sea by the rich foliage of rows 
of large Barringtonia and other trees, which girt the 
shore.&nbsp; The village was about a mile in length, and 
perfectly straight, with a wide road down the middle, on either 
side of which were rows of the tufted-topped ti tree, whose 
delicate and beautiful blossoms, hanging beneath their 
plume-crested tops, added richness to the scene.&nbsp; The 
cottages of the natives were built beneath these trees, and were 
kept in the most excellent order, each having a little garden in 
front, tastefully laid out and planted, while the walks were 
covered with black and white pebbles.</p>
<p>Every house had doors and Venetian windows, painted partly 
with lamp black made from the candle-nut, and partly with red 
ochre, which contrasted powerfully with the dazzling coral lime 
that covered the walls.&nbsp; On a prominent position stood a 
handsome church, which was quite a curiosity in its way.&nbsp; It
was a hundred feet long by fifty broad, and was seated throughout
to accommodate upwards of two thousand persons.&nbsp; It had six 
large folding doors and twelve windows with Venetian blinds; and,
although a large and substantial edifice, it had been built, we 
were told by the teacher, in the space of two months!&nbsp; There
was not a single iron nail in the fabric, and the natives had 
constructed it chiefly with their stone and bone axes and other 
tools, having only one or two axes or tools of European 
manufacture.&nbsp; Everything around this beautiful spot wore an 
aspect of peace and plenty, and, as we dropped our anchor within 
a stone&rsquo;s cast of the substantial coral wharf, I could not 
avoid contrasting it with the wretched village of Emo, where I 
had witnessed so many frightful scenes.&nbsp; When the teacher 
afterwards told me that the people of this tribe had become 
converts only a year previous to our arrival, and that they had 
been living before that in the practice of the most bloody system
of idolatry, I could not refrain from exclaiming, &ldquo;What a 
convincing proof that Christianity is of God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On landing from our little boat, we were received with a warm 
welcome by the teacher and his wife; the latter being also a 
native, clothed in a simple European gown and straw bonnet.&nbsp;
The shore was lined with hundreds of natives, whose persons were 
all more or less clothed with native cloth.&nbsp; Some of the men
had on a kind of poncho formed of this cloth, their legs being 
uncovered.&nbsp; Others wore clumsily-fashioned trousers, and no 
upper garment except hats made of straw and cloth.&nbsp; Many of 
the dresses, both of women and men, were grotesque enough, being 
very bad imitations of the European garb; but all wore a dress of
some sort or other.&nbsp; They seemed very glad to see us, and 
crowded round us as the teacher led the way to his dwelling, 
where we were entertained, in the most sumptuous manner, on baked
pig and all the varieties of fruits and vegetables that the 
island produced.&nbsp; We were much annoyed, however, by the 
rats: they seemed to run about the house like domestic 
animals.&nbsp; As we sat at table, one of them peeped up at us 
over the edge of the cloth, close to Peterkin&rsquo;s elbow, who 
floored it with a blow on the snout from his knife, exclaiming as
he did so&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Mister Teacher, why don&rsquo;t you set traps 
for these brutes?&mdash;surely you are not fond of 
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the teacher, with a smile; &ldquo;we
would be glad to get rid of them if we could; but if we were to 
trap all the rats on the island, it would occupy our whole 
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they, then, so numerous?&rdquo; inquired Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They swarm everywhere.&nbsp; The poor heathens on the 
north side eat them, and think them very sweet.&nbsp; So did my 
people formerly; but they do not eat so many now, because the 
missionary who was last here expressed disgust at it.&nbsp; The 
poor people asked if it was wrong to eat rats; and he told them 
that it was certainly not wrong, but that the people of England 
would be much disgusted were they asked to eat rats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had not been an hour in the house of this kind-hearted man 
when we were convinced of the truth of his statement as to their 
numbers, for the rats ran about the floors in dozens, and, during
our meal, two men were stationed at the table to keep them 
off!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity you have no cats,&rdquo; said Peterkin, as 
he aimed a blow at another reckless intruder, and missed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would, indeed, be glad to have a few,&rdquo; 
rejoined the teacher, &ldquo;but they are difficult to be 
got.&nbsp; The hogs, we find, are very good rat-killers, but they
do not seem to be able to keep the numbers down.&nbsp; I have 
heard that they are better than cats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the teacher said this, his good-natured black face was 
wrinkled with a smile of merriment.&nbsp; Observing that I had 
noticed it, he said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I smiled just now when I remembered the fate of the 
first cat that was taken to Raratonga.&nbsp; This is one of the 
stations of the London Missionary Society.&nbsp; It, like our 
own, is infested with rats, and a cat was brought at last to the 
island.&nbsp; It was a large black one.&nbsp; On being turned 
loose, instead of being content to stay among men, the cat took 
to the mountains, and lived in a wild state, sometimes paying 
visits during the night to the houses of the natives; some of 
whom, living at a distance from the settlement, had not heard of 
the cat&rsquo;s arrival, and were dreadfully frightened in 
consequence, calling it a &lsquo;monster of the deep,&rsquo; and 
flying in terror away from it.&nbsp; One night the cat, feeling a
desire for company, I suppose, took its way to the house of a 
chief, who had recently been converted to Christianity, and had 
begun to learn to read and pray.&nbsp; The chief&rsquo;s wife, 
who was sitting awake at his side while he slept, beheld with 
horror two fires glistening in the doorway, and heard with 
surprise a mysterious voice.&nbsp; Almost petrified with fear, 
she awoke her husband, and began to upbraid him for forsaking his
old religion, and burning his god, who, she declared, was now 
come to be avenged of them.&nbsp; &lsquo;Get up and pray! get up 
and pray!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; The chief arose, and, on 
opening his eyes, beheld the same glaring lights, and heard the 
same ominous sound.&nbsp; Impelled by the extreme urgency of the 
case, he commenced, with all possible vehemence, to vociferate 
the alphabet, as a prayer to God to deliver them from the 
vengeance of Satan!&nbsp; On hearing this, the cat, as much 
alarmed as themselves, fled precipitately away, leaving the chief
and his wife congratulating themselves on the efficacy of their 
prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were much diverted with this anecdote, which the teacher 
related in English so good, that we certainly could not have 
supposed him a native but for the colour of his face and the 
foreign accent in his tone.&nbsp; Next day we walked out with 
this interesting man, and were much entertained and instructed by
his conversation, as we rambled through the cool shady groves of 
bananas, citrons, limes, and other trees, or sauntered among the 
cottages of the natives, and watched them while they laboured 
diligently in the taro beds, or manufactured the tapa or native 
cloth.&nbsp; To some of these Jack put questions through the 
medium of the missionary; and the replies were such as to 
surprise us at the extent of their knowledge.&nbsp; Indeed, 
Peterkin very truly remarked that &ldquo;they seemed to know a 
considerable deal more than Jack himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among other pieces of interesting information that we obtained
was the following, in regard to coral formations:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The islands of the Pacific,&rdquo; said our friend, 
&ldquo;are of three different kinds or classes.&nbsp; Those of 
the first class are volcanic, mountainous, and wild; some 
shooting their jagged peaks into the clouds at an elevation of 
ten and fifteen thousand feet.&nbsp; Those of the second class 
are of crystalized limestone, and vary in height from one hundred
to five hundred feet.&nbsp; The hills on these are not so wild or
broken as those of the first class, but are richly clothed with 
vegetation, and very beautiful.&nbsp; I have no doubt that the 
Coral Island on which you were wrecked was one of this 
class.&nbsp; They are supposed to have been upheaved from the 
bottom of the sea by volcanic agency, but they are not themselves
volcanic in their nature, neither are they of coral 
formation.&nbsp; Those of the third class are the low coralline 
islands usually having lagoons of water in their midst; they are 
very numerous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the manner in which coral islands and reefs are 
formed; there are various opinions on this point.&nbsp; I will 
give you what seems to me the most probable theory,&mdash;a 
theory, I may add, which is held by some of the good and 
scientific missionaries.&nbsp; It is well known that there is 
much lime in salt water; it is also known that coral is composed 
of lime.&nbsp; It is supposed that the polypes, or coral insects,
have the power of attracting this lime to their bodies; and with 
this material they build their little cells or habitations.&nbsp;
They choose the summit of a volcano, or the top of a submarine 
mountain, as a foundation on which to build; for it is found that
they never work at any great depth below the surface.&nbsp; On 
this they work; the polypes on the mountain top, of course, reach
the surface first, then those at the outer edges reach the top 
sooner than the others between them and the centre, thus forming 
the coral reef surrounding the lagoon of water and the central 
island; after that the insects within the lagoon cease 
working.&nbsp; When the surface of the water is reached, these 
myriads of wonderful creatures die.&nbsp; Then birds visit the 
spot, and seeds are thus conveyed thither, which take root, and 
spring up, and flourish.&nbsp; Thus are commenced those coralline
islets of which you have seen so many in these seas.&nbsp; The 
reefs round the large islands are formed in a similar 
manner.&nbsp; When we consider,&rdquo; added the missionary, 
&ldquo;the smallness of the architects used by our heavenly 
Father in order to form those lovely and innumerable islands, we 
are filled with much of that feeling which induced the ancient 
king to exclaim, &lsquo;How manifold, O God, are thy works! in 
wisdom thou hast made them all.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all heartily agreed with the missionary in this sentiment, 
and felt not a little gratified to find that the opinions which 
Jack and I had been led to form from personal observation on our 
Coral Island were thus to a great extent corroborated.</p>
<p>The missionary also gave us an account of the manner in which 
Christianity had been introduced among them.&nbsp; He said: 
&ldquo;When missionaries were first sent here, three years ago, a
small vessel brought them; and the chief, who is now dead, 
promised to treat well the two native teachers who were left with
their wives on the island.&nbsp; But scarcely had the boat which 
landed them returned to the ship, than the natives began to 
maltreat their guests, taking away all they possessed, and 
offering them further violence, so that, when the boat was sent 
in haste to fetch them away, the clothes of both men and women 
were torn nearly off their backs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two years after this the vessel visited them again, and
I, being in her, volunteered to land alone, without any goods 
whatever; begging that my wife might be brought to me the 
following year,&mdash;that is, <i>this</i> year; and, as you see,
she is with me.&nbsp; But the surf was so high that the boat 
could not land me; so with nothing on but my trousers and shirt, 
and with a few catechisms and a Bible, besides some portions of 
the Scripture translated into the Mango tongue, I sprang into the
sea, and swam ashore on the crest of a breaker.&nbsp; I was 
instantly dragged up the beach by the natives; who, on finding I 
had nothing worth having upon me, let me alone.&nbsp; I then made
signs to my friends in the ship to leave me; which they 
did.&nbsp; At fist the natives listened to me in silence, but 
laughed at what I said while I preached the gospel of our blessed
Saviour Jesus Christ to them.&nbsp; Afterwards they treated me 
ill sometimes; but I persevered, and continued to dwell among 
them, and dispute, and exhort them to give up their sinful ways 
of life, burn their idols, and come to Jesus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a month after I landed, I heard that the chief 
was dead.&nbsp; He was the father of the present chief, who is 
now a most consistent member of the church.&nbsp; It is a custom 
here that, when a chief dies, his wives are strangled and buried 
with him.&nbsp; Knowing this, I hastened to his house to 
endeavour to prevent such cruelty if possible.&nbsp; When I 
arrived, I found two of the wives had already been killed, while 
another was in the act of being strangled.&nbsp; I pleaded hard 
for her, but it was too late; she was already dead.&nbsp; I then 
entreated the son to spare the fourth wife; and, after much 
hesitation, my prayer was granted: but, in half an hour 
afterwards, this poor woman repented of being unfaithful, as she 
termed it, to her husband, and insisted on being strangled; which
was accordingly done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this time the chief&rsquo;s son was walking up and 
down before his father&rsquo;s house with a brow black as 
thunder.&nbsp; When he entered, I went in with him, and found, to
my surprise, that his father was not dead!&nbsp; The old man was 
sitting on a mat in a corner, with an expression of placid 
resignation on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;have you strangled 
your father&rsquo;s wives before he is dead?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To this the son replied, &lsquo;He is dead.&nbsp; That 
is no longer my father.&nbsp; He is as good as dead now.&nbsp; He
is to be <i>buried alive</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I now remembered having heard that it is a custom among
the Feejee islanders, that when the reigning chief grows old or 
infirm, the heir to the chieftainship has a right to depose his 
father; in which case he is considered as dead, and is buried 
alive.&nbsp; The young chief was now about to follow this custom,
and, despite my earnest entreaties and pleadings, the old chief 
was buried that day before my eyes in the same grave with his 
four strangled wives!&nbsp; Oh! my heart groaned when I saw this,
and I prayed to God to open the hearts of these poor creatures, 
as he had already opened mine, and pour into them the light and 
the love of the gospel of Jesus.&nbsp; My prayer was answered 
very soon.&nbsp; A week afterwards, the son, who was now chief of
the tribe, came to me, bearing his god on his shoulders, and 
groaning beneath its weight.&nbsp; Flinging it down at my feet, 
he desired me to burn it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may conceive how overjoyed I was at this.&nbsp; I 
sprang up and embraced him, while I shed tears of joy.&nbsp; Then
we made a fire, and burned the god to ashes, amid an immense 
concourse of the people, who seemed terrified at what was being 
done, and shrank back when we burned the god, expecting some 
signal vengeance to be taken upon us; but seeing that nothing 
happened, they changed their minds, and thought that our God must
be the true one after all.&nbsp; From that time the mission 
prospered steadily, and now, while there is not a single man in 
the tribe who has not burned his household gods, and become a 
convert to Christianity, there are not a few, I hope, who are 
true followers of the Lamb, having been plucked as brands from 
the burning by Him who can save unto the uttermost.&nbsp; I will 
not tell you more of our progress at this time, but you 
see,&rdquo; he said, waving his hand around him, &ldquo;the 
village and the church did not exist a year ago!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were indeed much interested in this account, and I could 
not help again in my heart praying God to prosper those 
missionary societies that send such inestimable blessings to 
these islands of dark and bloody idolatry.&nbsp; The teacher also
added that the other tribes were very indignant at this one for 
having burned its gods, and threatened to destroy it altogether, 
but they had done nothing yet; &ldquo;and if they should,&rdquo; 
said the teacher, &ldquo;the Lord is on our side; of whom shall 
we be afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have the missionaries many stations in these 
seas?&rdquo; inquired Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&nbsp; The London Missionary Society have a 
great many in the Tahiti group, and other islands in that 
quarter.&nbsp; Then the Wesleyans have the Feejee Islands all to 
themselves, and the Americans have many stations in other 
groups.&nbsp; But still, my friend, there are hundreds of islands
here the natives of which have never heard of Jesus, or the good 
word of God, or the Holy Spirit; and thousands are living and 
dying in the practice of those terrible sins and bloody murders 
of which you have already heard.&nbsp; I trust, my 
friends,&rdquo; he added, looking earnestly into our faces, 
&ldquo;I trust that if you ever return to England, you will tell 
your Christian friends that the horrors which they hear of in 
regard to these islands are <i>literally true</i>, and that when 
they have heard the worst, the &lsquo;<i>half has not been told 
them</i>;&rsquo; for there are perpetrated here foul deeds of 
darkness of which man may not speak.&nbsp; You may also tell 
them,&rdquo; he said, looking around with a smile, while a tear 
of gratitude trembled in his eye and rolled down his coal-black 
cheek,&mdash;&ldquo;tell them of the blessings that the gospel 
has wrought <i>here</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We assured our friend that we would certainly not forget his 
request.&nbsp; On returning towards the village, about noon, we 
remarked on the beautiful whiteness of the cottages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is owing to the lime with which they are 
plastered,&rdquo; said the teacher.&nbsp; &ldquo;When the natives
were converted, as I have described, I set them to work to build 
cottages for themselves, and also this handsome church which you 
see.&nbsp; When the framework and other parts of the houses were 
up, I sent the people to fetch coral from the sea.&nbsp; They 
brought immense quantities.&nbsp; Then I made them cut wood, and,
piling the coral above it, set it on fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look! look!&rsquo; cried the poor people, in 
amazement; &lsquo;what wonderful people the Christians are!&nbsp;
He is roasting stones.&nbsp; We shall not need taro or 
bread-fruit any more; we may eat stones!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But their surprise was still greater when the coral was
reduced to a fine soft white powder.&nbsp; They immediately set 
up a great shout, and, mingling the lime with water, rubbed their
faces and their bodies all over with it, and ran through the 
village screaming with delight.&nbsp; They were also much 
surprised at another thing they saw me do.&nbsp; I wished to make
some household furniture, and constructed a turning-lathe to 
assist me.&nbsp; The first thing that I turned was the leg of a 
sofa; which was no sooner finished than the chief seized it with 
wonder and delight, and ran through the village exhibiting it to 
the people, who looked upon it with great admiration.&nbsp; The 
chief then, tying a string to it, hung it round his neck as an 
ornament!&nbsp; He afterwards told me that if he had seen it 
before he became a Christian he would have made it his 
god!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the teacher concluded this anecdote we reached his 
door.&nbsp; Saying that he had business to attend to, he left us 
to amuse ourselves as we best could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, lads,&rdquo; said Jack, turning abruptly towards 
us, and buttoning up his jacket as he spoke, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off
to see the battle.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve no particular fondness for 
seein&rsquo; blood-shed, but I must find out the nature o&rsquo; 
these fellows and see their customs with my own eyes, so that I 
may be able to speak of it again, if need be, 
authoritatively.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only six miles off, and we 
don&rsquo;t run much more risk than that of getting a rap with a 
stray stone or an over-shot arrow.&nbsp; Will you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure we will,&rdquo; said Peterkin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they chance to see us we&rsquo;ll cut and run for 
it,&rdquo; added Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; cried Peterkin,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>you</i>
run! thought you would scorn to run from any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I would, if it were my duty to fight,&rdquo; 
returned Jack, coolly; &ldquo;but as I don&rsquo;t want to fight,
and don&rsquo;t intend to fight, if they offer to attack us 
I&rsquo;ll run away like the veriest coward that ever went by the
name of Peterkin.&nbsp; So come along.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
<p>A strange and bloody battle&mdash;The lion bearded in his 
den&mdash;Frightful scenes of cruelty, and fears for the 
future.</p>
<p>We had ascertained from the teacher the direction to the spot 
on which the battle was to be fought, and after a walk of two 
hours reached it.&nbsp; The summit of a bare hill was the place 
chosen; for, unlike most of the other islanders, who are addicted
to bush-fighting, those of Mango are in the habit of meeting on 
open ground.&nbsp; We arrived before the two parties had 
commenced the deadly struggle, and, creeping as close up as we 
dared among the rocks, we lay and watched them.</p>
<p>The combatants were drawn up face to face, each side ranged in
rank four deep.&nbsp; Those in the first row were armed with long
spears; the second, with clubs to defend the spearmen; the third 
row was composed of young men with slings; and the fourth 
consisted of women, who carried baskets of stones for the 
slingers, and clubs and spears with which to supply the 
warriors.&nbsp; Soon after we arrived, the attack was made with 
great fury.&nbsp; There was no science displayed.&nbsp; The two 
bodies of savages rushed headlong upon each other and engaged in 
a general <i>melee</i>, and a more dreadful set of men I have 
never seen.&nbsp; They wore grotesque war-caps made of various 
substances and decorated with feathers.&nbsp; Their faces and 
bodies were painted so as to make them look as frightful as 
possible; and as they brandished their massive clubs, leaped, 
shouted, yelled, and dashed each other to the ground, I thought I
had never seen men look so like demons before.</p>
<p>We were much surprised at the conduct of the women, who seemed
to be perfect furies, and hung about the heels of their husbands 
in order to defend them.&nbsp; One stout young women we saw, 
whose husband was hard pressed and about to be overcome: she 
lifted a large stone, and throwing it at his opponent&rsquo;s 
head, felled him to the earth.&nbsp; But the battle did not last 
long.&nbsp; The band most distant from us gave way and were 
routed, leaving eighteen of their comrades dead upon the 
field.&nbsp; These the victors brained as they lay; and putting 
some of their brains on leaves went off with them, we were 
afterwards informed, to their temples, to present them to their 
gods as an earnest of the human victims who were soon to be 
brought there.</p>
<p>We hastened back to the Christian village with feelings of the
deepest sadness at the sanguinary conflict which we had just 
witnessed.</p>
<p>Next day, after breakfasting with our friend the teacher, we 
made preparations for carrying out our plan.&nbsp; At first the 
teacher endeavoured to dissuade us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know,&rdquo; said he, turning to Jack, 
&ldquo;the danger you run in venturing amongst these ferocious 
savages.&nbsp; I feel much pity for poor Avatea; but you are not 
likely to succeed in saving her, and you may die in the 
attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jack, quietly, &ldquo;I am not afraid
to die in a good cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The teacher smiled approvingly at him as he said this, and 
after a little further conversation agreed to accompany us as 
interpreter; saying that, although Tararo was unfriendly to him, 
he had hitherto treated him with respect.</p>
<p>We now went on board the schooner, having resolved to sail 
round the island and drop anchor opposite the heathen 
village.&nbsp; We manned her with natives, and hoped to overawe 
the savages by displaying our brass gun to advantage.&nbsp; The 
teacher soon after came on board, and setting our sails we put to
sea.&nbsp; In two hours more we made the cliffs reverberate with 
the crash of the big gun, which we fired by way of salute, while 
we ran the British ensign up to the peak and cast anchor.&nbsp; 
The commotion on shore showed us that we had struck terror into 
the hearts of the natives; but seeing that we did not offer to 
molest them, a canoe at length put off and paddled cautiously 
towards us.&nbsp; The teacher showed himself, and explaining that
we were friends and wished to palaver with the chief, desired the
native to go and tell him to come on board.</p>
<p>We waited long and with much impatience for an answer.&nbsp; 
During this time the native teacher conversed with us again, and 
told us many things concerning the success of the gospel among 
those islands; and perceiving that we were by no means so much 
gratified as we ought to have been at the hearing of such good 
news, he pressed us more closely in regard to our personal 
interest in religion, and exhorted us to consider that our souls 
were certainly in as great danger as those of the wretched 
heathen whom we pitied so much, if we had not already found 
salvation in Jesus Christ.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, further,&rdquo; he 
added, &ldquo;if such be your unhappy case, you are, in the sight
of God, much worse than these savages (forgive me, my young 
friends, for saying so); for they have no knowledge, no light, 
and do not profess to believe; while you, on the contrary, have 
been brought up in the light of the blessed gospel and call 
yourselves Christians.&nbsp; These poor savages are indeed the 
enemies of our Lord; but you, if ye be not true believers, are 
traitors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I must confess that my heart condemned me while the teacher 
spoke in this earnest manner, and I knew not what to reply.&nbsp;
Peterkin, too, did not seem to like it, and I thought would 
willingly have escaped; but Jack seemed deeply impressed, and 
wore an anxious expression on his naturally grave countenance, 
while he assented to the teacher&rsquo;s remarks and put to him 
many earnest questions.&nbsp; Meanwhile the natives who composed 
our crew, having nothing particular to do, had squatted down on 
the deck and taken out their little books containing the 
translated portions of the New Testament, along with hymns and 
spelling-books, and were now busily engaged, some vociferating 
the alphabet, others learning prayers off by heart, while a few 
sang hymns,&mdash;all of them being utterly unmindful of our 
presence.&nbsp; The teacher soon joined them, and soon afterwards
they all engaged in a prayer which was afterwards translated to 
us, and proved to be a petition for the success of our 
undertaking and for the conversion of the heathen.</p>
<p>While we were thus engaged a canoe put off from shore and 
several savages leaped on deck, one of whom advanced to the 
teacher and informed him that Tararo could not come on board that
day, being busy with some religious ceremonies before the gods, 
which could on no account be postponed.&nbsp; He was also engaged
with a friendly chief who was about to take his departure from 
the island, and therefore begged that the teacher and his friends
would land and pay a visit to him.&nbsp; To this the teacher 
returned answer that we would land immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, lads,&rdquo; said Jack, as we were about to step 
into our little boat, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to take any 
weapons with me, and I recommend you to take none either.&nbsp; 
We are altogether in the power of these savages, and the utmost 
we could do, if they were to attack us, would be to kill a few of
them before we were ourselves overpowered.&nbsp; I think that our
only chance of success lies in mild measures.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t 
you think so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this I assented gladly, and Peterkin replied by laying down
a huge bell-mouthed blunderbuss, and divesting himself of a pair 
of enormous horse-pistols with which he had purposed to overawe 
the natives!&nbsp; We then jumped into our boat and rowed 
ashore.</p>
<p>On reaching the beach we were received by a crowd of naked 
savages, who shouted a rude welcome, and conducted us to a house 
or shed where a baked pig and a variety of vegetables were 
prepared for us.&nbsp; Having partaken of these, the teacher 
begged to be conducted to the chief; but there seemed some 
hesitation, and after some consultation among themselves, one of 
the men stood forward and spoke to the teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What says he?&rdquo; inquired Jack when the savage had 
concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says that the chief is just going to the temple of 
his god and cannot see us yet; so we must be patient, my 
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried Jack, rising; &ldquo;if he 
won&rsquo;t come to see me, I&rsquo;ll e&rsquo;en go and see 
him.&nbsp; Besides, I have a great desire to witness their 
proceedings at this temple of theirs.&nbsp; Will you go with me, 
friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; said the teacher, shaking his head; 
&ldquo;I must not go to the heathen temples and witness their 
inhuman rites, except for the purpose of condemning their 
wickedness and folly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; returned Jack; &ldquo;then I&rsquo;ll
go alone, for I cannot condemn their doings till I have seen 
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack arose, and we, having determined to go also, followed him
through the banana groves to a rising ground immediately behind 
the village, on the top of which stood the Bur&eacute;, or 
temple, under the dark shade of a group of iron-wood trees.&nbsp;
As we went through the village, I was again led to contrast the 
rude huts and sheds, and their almost naked savage-looking 
inhabitants, with the natives of the Christian village, who, to 
use the teacher&rsquo;s scriptural expression, were now 
&ldquo;clothed and in their right mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we turned into a broad path leading towards the hill, we 
were arrested by the shouts of an approaching multitude in the 
rear.&nbsp; Drawing aside into the bushes we awaited their coming
up, and as they drew near we observed that it was a procession of
the natives, many of whom were dancing and gesticulating in the 
most frantic manner.&nbsp; They had an exceedingly hideous 
aspect, owing to the black, red, and yellow paints with which 
their faces and naked bodies were bedaubed.&nbsp; In the midst of
these came a band of men carrying three or four planks, on which 
were seated in rows upwards of a dozen men.&nbsp; I shuddered 
involuntarily as I recollected the sacrifice of human victims at 
the island of Emo, and turned with a look of fear to Jack as I 
said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack!&nbsp; I have a terrible dread that they are 
going to commit some of their cruel practices on these wretched 
men.&nbsp; We had better not go to the temple.&nbsp; We shall 
only be horrified without being able to do any good, for I fear 
they are going to kill them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s face wore an expression of deep compassion as he 
said, in a low voice, &ldquo;No fear, Ralph; the sufferings of 
these poor fellows are over long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned with a start as he spoke, and, glancing at the men, 
who were now quite near to the spot where we stood, saw that they
were all dead.&nbsp; They were tied firmly with ropes in a 
sitting posture on the planks, and seemed, as they bent their 
sightless eye-balls and grinning mouths over the dancing crew 
below, as if they were laughing in ghastly mockery at the utter 
inability of their enemies to hurt them now.&nbsp; These, we 
discovered afterwards, were the men who had been slain in the 
battle of the previous day, and were now on their way to be first
presented to the gods, and then eaten.&nbsp; Behind these came 
two men leading between them a third, whose hands were pinioned 
behind his back.&nbsp; He walked with a firm step, and wore a 
look of utter indifference on his face, as they led him along; so
that we concluded he must be a criminal who was about to receive 
some slight punishment for his faults.&nbsp; The rear of the 
procession was brought up by a shouting crowd of women and 
children, with whom we mingled and followed to the temple.</p>
<p>Here we arrived in a few minutes.&nbsp; The temple was a tall 
circular building, open at one side.&nbsp; Around it were strewn 
heaps of human bones and skulls.&nbsp; At a table inside sat the 
priest, an elderly man, with a long gray beard.&nbsp; He was 
seated on a stool, and before him lay several knives, made of 
wood, bone, and splinters of bamboo, with which he performed his 
office of dissecting dead bodies.&nbsp; Farther in lay a variety 
of articles that had been dedicated to the god, and among them 
were many spears and clubs.&nbsp; I observed among the latter 
some with human teeth sticking in them, where the victims had 
been clubbed in their mouths.</p>
<p>Before this temple the bodies, which were painted with 
vermilion and soot, were arranged in a sitting posture; and a 
man, called a &ldquo;dan-vosa&rdquo; (orator), advanced, and, 
laying his hands on their heads, began to chide them, apparently,
in a low bantering tone.&nbsp; What he said we knew not, but, as 
he went on, he waxed warm, and at last shouted to them at the top
of his lungs, and finally finished by kicking the bodies over and
running away, amid the shouts and laughter of the people, who now
rushed forward.&nbsp; Seizing the bodies by a leg, or an arm, or 
by the hair of the head, they dragged them over stumps and stones
and through sloughs, until they were exhausted.&nbsp; The bodies 
were then brought back to the temple and dissected by the priest,
after which they were taken out to be baked.</p>
<p>Close to the temple a large fire was kindled, in which stones 
were heated red hot.&nbsp; When ready these were spread out on 
the ground, and a thick coating of leaves strewn over them to 
slack the heat.&nbsp; On this &ldquo;lovo,&rdquo; or oven, the 
bodies were then placed, covered over, and left to bake.</p>
<p>The crowd now ran, with terrible yells, towards a neighbouring
hill or mound, on which we observed the frame-work of a house 
lying ready to be erected.&nbsp; Sick with horror, yet fascinated
by curiosity, we staggered after them mechanically, scarce 
knowing where we were going or what we did, and feeling a sort of
impression that all we saw was a dreadful dream.</p>
<p>Arrived at the place, we saw the multitude crowding round a 
certain spot.&nbsp; We pressed forward and obtained a sight of 
what they were doing.&nbsp; A large wooden beam or post lay on 
the ground, beside the other parts of the frame-work of the 
house, and close to the end of it was a hole about seven feet 
deep and upwards of two feet wide.&nbsp; While we looked, the man
whom we had before observed with his hands pinioned, was carried 
into the circle.&nbsp; His hands were now free, but his legs were
tightly strapped together.&nbsp; The post of the house was then 
placed in the hole, and the man put in beside it.&nbsp; His head 
was a good way below the surface of the hole, and his arms were 
clasped round the post.&nbsp; Earth was now thrown in until all 
was covered over and stamped down; and this, we were afterwards 
told, was a <i>ceremony</i> usually performed at the dedication 
of a new temple, or the erection of a chief&rsquo;s house!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; cried Jack, on beholding this 
horrible tragedy, &ldquo;we have seen enough, enough, far more 
than enough!&nbsp; Let us go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s face looked ghastly pale and haggard as we 
hurried back to rejoin the teacher, and I have no doubt that he 
felt terrible anxiety when he considered the number and ferocity 
of the savages, and the weakness of the few arms which were ready
indeed to essay, but impotent to effect, Avatea&rsquo;s 
deliverance from these ruthless men.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
<p>An unexpected discovery, and a bold, reckless defiance, with 
its consequences&mdash;Plans of escape, and heroic resolves.</p>
<p>When we returned to the shore, and related to our friend what 
had passed, he was greatly distressed, and groaned in spirit; but
we had not sat long in conversation, when we were interrupted by 
the arrival of Tararo on the beach, accompanied by a number of 
followers bearing baskets of vegetables and fruits on their 
heads.</p>
<p>We advanced to meet him, and he expressed, through our 
interpreter, much pleasure in seeing us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is it that my friends wish to say to 
me?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>The teacher explained that we came to beg that Avatea might be
spared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;that I consider that
I have a right to ask this of him, having not only saved the 
girl&rsquo;s life, but the lives of his own people also; and say 
that I wish her to be allowed to follow her own wishes, and join 
the Christians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While this was being translated, the chiefs brow lowered, and 
we could see plainly that our request met with no favourable 
reception.&nbsp; He replied with considerable energy, and at some
length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What says he?&rdquo; inquired Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret to say that he will not listen to the 
proposal.&nbsp; He says he has pledged his word to his friend 
that the girl shall be sent to him, and a deputy is even now on 
this island awaiting the fulfilment of the pledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack bit his lip in suppressed anger.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell 
Tararo,&rdquo; he exclaimed with flashing eye, &ldquo;that if he 
does not grant my demand, it will be worse for him.&nbsp; Say I 
have a big gun on board my schooner that will blow his village 
into the sea, if he does not give up the girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, my friend,&rdquo; said the teacher, gently, 
&ldquo;I will not tell him that; we must overcome evil with 
good.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does my friend say?&rdquo; inquired the chief, who
seemed nettled by Jack&rsquo;s looks of defiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is displeased,&rdquo; replied the teacher.</p>
<p>Tararo turned away with a smile of contempt, and walked 
towards the men who carried the baskets of vegetables, and who 
had now emptied the whole on the beach in an enormous pile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they doing there?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that they are laying out a gift which they 
intend to present to some one,&rdquo; said the teacher.</p>
<p>At this moment a couple of men appeared leading a young girl 
between them; and, going towards the heap of fruits and 
vegetables, placed her on the top of it.&nbsp; We started with 
surprise and fear, for in the young female before us we 
recognised the Samoan girl, Avatea!</p>
<p>We stood rooted to the earth with surprise and thick coming 
fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! my dear young friend,&rdquo; whispered the teacher,
in a voice of deep emotion, while he seized Jack by the arm, 
&ldquo;she is to be made a sacrifice even now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she?&rdquo; cried Jack, with a vehement shout, 
spurning the teacher aside, and dashing over two natives who 
stood in his way, while he rushed towards the heap, sprang up its
side, and seized Avatea by the arm.&nbsp; In another moment he 
dragged her down, placed her back to a large tree, and, wrenching
a war-club from the hand of a native who seemed powerless and 
petrified with surprise, whirled it above his head, and yelled, 
rather than shouted, while his face blazed with fury, &ldquo;Come
on, the whole nation of you, an ye like it, and do your 
worst!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed as though the challenge had been literally accepted;
for every savage on the ground ran precipitately at Jack with 
club and spear, and, doubtless, would speedily have poured out 
his brave blood on the sod, had not the teacher rushed in between
them, and, raising his voice to its utmost, cried.&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay your hands, warriors!&nbsp; It is not your part to
judge in this matter.&nbsp; It is for Tararo, the chief, to say 
whether or not the young man shall live or die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The natives were arrested; and I know not whether it was the 
gratifying acknowledgment of his superiority thus made by the 
teacher, or some lingering feeling of gratitude for Jack&rsquo;s 
former aid in time of need, that influenced Tararo, but he 
stepped forward, and, waving his hand, said to his 
people,&mdash;&ldquo;Desist.&nbsp; The young man&rsquo;s life is 
mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, turning to Jack, he said, &ldquo;You 
have forfeited your liberty and life to me.&nbsp; Submit 
yourself, for we are more numerous than the sand upon the 
shore.&nbsp; You are but one; why should you die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Villain!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, passionately, &ldquo;I 
may die, but, assuredly, I shall not perish alone.&nbsp; I will 
not submit until you promise that this girl shall not be 
injured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very bold,&rdquo; replied the chief, haughtily,
&ldquo;but very foolish.&nbsp; Yet I will say that Avatea shall 
not be sent away, at least for three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better accept these terms,&rdquo; whispered the
teacher, entreatingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you persist in this mad 
defiance, you will be slain, and Avatea will be lost.&nbsp; Three
days are worth having.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack hesitated a moment, then lowered his club, and, throwing 
it moodily to the ground, crossed his arms on his breast, and 
hung down his head in silence.</p>
<p>Tararo seemed pleased by his submission, and told the teacher 
to say that he did not forget his former services, and, 
therefore, would leave him free as to his person, but that the 
schooner would be detained till he had further considered the 
matter.</p>
<p>While the teacher translated this, he approached as near to 
where Avatea was standing as possible, without creating 
suspicion, and whispered to her a few words in the native 
language.&nbsp; Avatea, who, during the whole of the foregoing 
scene, had stood leaning against the tree perfectly passive, and 
seemingly quite uninterested in all that was going on, replied by
a single rapid glance of her dark eye, which was instantly cast 
down again on the ground at her feet.</p>
<p>Tararo now advanced, and taking the girl by the hand, led her 
unresistingly away, while Jack, Peterkin, and I returned with the
teacher on board the schooner.</p>
<p>On reaching the deck, we went down to the cabin, where Jack 
threw himself, in a state of great dejection, on a couch; but the
teacher seated himself by his side, and, laying his hand upon his
shoulder, said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not give way to anger, my young friend.&nbsp; God 
has given us three days, and we must use the means that are in 
our power to free this poor girl from slavery.&nbsp; We must not 
sit in idle disappointment, we must act&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Act!&rdquo; cried Jack, raising himself, and tossing 
back his hair wildly; &ldquo;it is mockery to balk of acting when
one is bound hand and foot.&nbsp; How can I act?&nbsp; I cannot 
fight a whole nation of savages single-handed.&nbsp; Yes,&rdquo; 
he said, with a bitter smile, &ldquo;I can fight them, but I 
cannot conquer them, or save Avatea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience, my friend; your spirit is not a good one just
now.&nbsp; You cannot expect that blessing which alone can insure
success, unless you are more submissive.&nbsp; I will tell you my
plans if you will listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; cried Jack, eagerly, &ldquo;of course I 
will, my good fellow; I did not know you had any plans.&nbsp; Out
with them.&nbsp; I only hope you will show me how I can get the 
girl on board of this schooner, and I&rsquo;d up anchor and away 
in no time.&nbsp; But proceed with your plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The teacher smiled sadly: &ldquo;Ah! my friend, if one fathom 
of your anchor chain were to rattle, as you drew it in, a 
thousand warriors would be standing on your deck.&nbsp; No, no, 
that could not be done.&nbsp; Even now, your ship would be taken 
from you were it not that Tararo has some feeling of gratitude 
toward you.&nbsp; But I know Tararo well.&nbsp; He is a man of 
falsehood, as all the unconverted savages are.&nbsp; The chief to
whom he has promised this girl is very powerful, and Tararo 
<i>must</i> fulfil his promise.&nbsp; He has told you that he 
would do nothing to the girl for three days; but that is because 
the party who are to take her away will not be ready to start for
three days.&nbsp; Still, as he might have made you a prisoner 
during those three days, I say that God has given them to 
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but what do you propose to do?&rdquo; said Jack, 
impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My plan involves much danger, but I see no other, and I
think you have courage to brave it.&nbsp; It is this: There is an
island about fifty miles to the south of this, the natives of 
which are Christians, and have been so for two years or more, and
the principal chief is Avatea&rsquo;s lover.&nbsp; Once there, 
Avatea would be safe.&nbsp; Now, I suggest that you should 
abandon your schooner.&nbsp; Do you think that you can make so 
great a sacrifice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend,&rdquo; replied Jack, &ldquo;when I make up my 
mind to go through with a thing of importance, I can make any 
sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The teacher smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, then, the savages could
not conceive it possible that, for the sake of a girl, you would 
voluntarily lose your fine vessel; therefore as long as she lies 
here they think they have you all safe: so I suggest that we get 
a quantity of stores conveyed to a sequestered part of the shore,
provide a small canoe, put Avatea on board, and you three would 
paddle to the Christian island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; cried Peterkin, springing up and seizing 
the teacher&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Missionary, you&rsquo;re a
regular brick.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t think you had so much in 
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for me,&rdquo; continued the teacher, &ldquo;I will 
remain on board till they discover that you are gone.&nbsp; Then 
they will ask me where you are gone to, and I will refuse to 
tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;ll be the result of that?&rdquo; 
inquired Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not.&nbsp; Perhaps they will kill me; 
but,&rdquo; he added, looking at Jack with a peculiar smile, 
&ldquo;I too am not afraid to die in a good cause!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how are we to get hold of Avatea?&rdquo; inquired 
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have arranged with her to meet us at a particular 
spot, to which I will guide you to-night.&nbsp; We shall then 
arrange about it.&nbsp; She will easily manage to elude her 
keepers, who are not very strict in watching her, thinking it 
impossible that she could escape from the island.&nbsp; Indeed, I
am sure that such an idea will never enter their heads.&nbsp; 
But, as I have said, you run great danger.&nbsp; Fifty miles in a
small canoe, on the open sea, is a great voyage to make.&nbsp; 
You may miss the island, too, in which case there is no other in 
that direction for a hundred miles or more; and if you lose your 
way and fall among other heathens, you know the law of 
Feejee&mdash;a cast-away who gains the shore is doomed to 
die.&nbsp; You must count the cost, my young friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have counted it,&rdquo; replied Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
Avatea consents to run the risk, most certainly I will; and so 
will my comrades also.&nbsp; Besides,&rdquo; added Jack, looking 
seriously into the teacher&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;your 
Bible,&mdash;<i>our</i> Bible, tells of ONE who delivers those 
who call on Him in the time of trouble; who holds the winds in 
his fists and the waters in the hollow of his hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now set about active preparations for the intended voyage; 
collected together such things as we should require, and laid out
on the deck provisions sufficient to maintain us for several 
weeks, purposing to load the canoe with as much as she could hold
consistently with speed and safety.&nbsp; These we covered with a
tarpaulin, intending to convey them to the canoe only a few hours
before starting.&nbsp; When night spread her sable curtain over 
the scene, we prepared to land; but, first, kneeling along with 
the natives and the teacher, the latter implored a blessing on 
our enterprise.&nbsp; Then we rowed quietly to the shore and 
followed our sable guide, who led us by a long detour, in order 
to avoid the village, to the place of rendezvous.&nbsp; We had 
not stood more than five minutes under the gloomy shade of the 
thick foliage when a dark figure glided noiselessly up to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! here you are,&rdquo; said Jack, as Avatea 
approached.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, then, tell her what we&rsquo;ve 
come about, and don&rsquo;t waste time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understan&rsquo; leetl English,&rdquo; said Avatea, 
in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, where did you pick up English?&rdquo; exclaimed 
Jack, in amazement; &ldquo;you were dumb as a stone when I saw 
you last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has learned all she knows of it from me,&rdquo; 
said the teacher, &ldquo;since she came to the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now gave Avatea a full explanation of our plans, entering 
into all the details, and concealing none of the danger, so that 
she might be fully aware of the risk she ran.&nbsp; As we had 
anticipated, she was too glad of the opportunity thus afforded 
her to escape from her persecutors to think of the danger or 
risk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re willing to go with us, are 
you?&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yis, I am willing to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re not afraid to trust yourself out on 
the deep sea so far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I not &rsquo;fraid to go.&nbsp; Safe with 
Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some further consultation, the teacher suggested that it
was time to return, so we bade Avatea good night, and having 
appointed to meet at the cliff where the canoe lay, on the 
following night, just after dark, we hastened away&mdash;we to 
row on board the schooner with muffled oars&mdash;Avatea to glide
back to her prison-hut among the Mango savages.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
<p>The flight&mdash;The pursuit&mdash;Despair and its 
results&mdash;The lion bearded in his den again&mdash;Awful 
danger threatened and wonderfully averted&mdash;A terrific 
storm.</p>
<p>As the time for our meditated flight drew near, we became 
naturally very fearful lest our purpose should be discovered, and
we spent the whole of the following day in a state of nervous 
anxiety.&nbsp; We resolved to go a-shore and ramble about the 
village, as if to observe the habits and dwellings of the people,
as we thought that an air of affected indifference to the events 
of the previous day would be more likely than any other course of
conduct to avert suspicion as to our intentions.&nbsp; While we 
were thus occupied, the teacher remained on board with the 
Christian natives, whose powerful voices reached us ever and anon
as they engaged in singing hymns or in prayer.</p>
<p>At last the long and tedious day came to a close, the sank 
into the sea, and the short-lived twilight of those regions, to 
which I have already referred, ended abruptly in a dark 
night.&nbsp; Hastily throwing a few blankets into our little 
boat, we stepped into it, and, whispering farewell to the natives
in the schooner, rowed gently over the lagoon, taking care to 
keep as near to the beach as possible.&nbsp; We rowed in the 
utmost silence and with muffled oars, so that had any one 
observed us at the distance of a few yards, he might have almost 
taken us for a phantom-boat or a shadow on the dark water.&nbsp; 
Not a breath of air was stirring; but fortunately the gentle 
ripple of the sea upon the shore, mingled with the soft roar of 
the breaker on the distant reef, effectually drowned the slight 
plash that we unavoidably made in the water by the dipping of our
oars.</p>
<p>Quarter of an hour sufficed to bring us to the over-hanging 
cliff under whose black shadow our little canoe lay, with her bow
in the water ready to be launched, and most of her cargo already 
stowed away.&nbsp; As the keel of our little boat grated on the 
sand, a hand was laid upon the bow, and a dim form was seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said Peterkin in a whisper, as he stepped 
upon the beach, &ldquo;is that you, Avatea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yis, it am me,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&nbsp; Now, then, gently.&nbsp; Help me to 
shove off the canoe,&rdquo; whispered Jack to the teacher; 
&ldquo;and Peterkin, do you shove these blankets aboard, we may 
want them before long.&nbsp; Avatea, step into the 
middle;&mdash;that&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is all ready?&rdquo; whispered the teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; replied Peterkin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here, 
Ralph, lay hold o&rsquo; this pair of oars, and stow them away if
you can.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like paddles.&nbsp; After 
we&rsquo;re safe away I&rsquo;ll try to rig up rollicks for 
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, in with you and shove off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One more earnest squeeze of the kind teacher&rsquo;s hand, 
and, with his whispered blessing yet sounding in our ears, we 
shot like an arrow from the shore, sped over the still waters of 
the lagoon, and paddled as swiftly as strong arms and willing 
hearts could urge us over the long swell of the open sea.</p>
<p>All that night and the whole of the following day we plied our
paddles in almost total silence and without halt, save twice to 
recruit our failing energies with a mouthful of food and a 
draught of water.&nbsp; Jack had taken the bearing of the island 
just after starting, and laying a small pocket-compass before 
him, kept the head of the canoe due south, for our chance of 
hitting the island depended very much on the faithfulness of our 
steersman in keeping our tiny bark exactly and constantly on its 
proper course.&nbsp; Peterkin and I paddled in the bow, and 
Avatea worked untiringly in the middle.</p>
<p>As the sun&rsquo;s lower limb dipped on the gilded edge of the
sea Jack ceased working, threw down his paddle, and called a 
halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he cried, heaving a deep, long-drawn 
sigh, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve put a considerable breadth of water 
between us and these black rascals, so now we&rsquo;ll have a 
hearty supper and a sound sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; cried Peterkin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nobly 
spoken, Jack.&nbsp; Hand me a drop water, Ralph.&nbsp; Why, girl 
what&rsquo;s wrong with you?&nbsp; You look just like a black owl
blinking in the sunshine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Avatea smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;I sleepy,&rdquo; she said; and as 
if to prove the truth of this, she laid her head on the edge of 
the canoe and fell fast asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s uncommon sharp practice,&rdquo; said 
Peterkin, with a broad grin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think 
we should awake her to make her eat something first? or, 
perhaps,&rdquo; he added, with a grave, meditative look, 
&ldquo;perhaps we might put some food in her mouth, which is so 
elegantly open at the present moment, and see if she&rsquo;d 
swallow it while asleep.&nbsp; If so, Ralph, you might come round
to the front here and feed her quietly, while Jack and I are 
tucking into the victuals.&nbsp; It would be a monstrous economy 
of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not help smiling at Peterkin&rsquo;s idea, which, 
indeed, when I pondered it, seemed remarkably good in theory; 
nevertheless I declined to put it in practice, being fearful of 
the result should the victual chance to go down the wrong 
throat.&nbsp; But, on suggesting this to Peterkin, he 
exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down the wrong throat, man! why, a fellow with half an 
eye might see that if it went down Avatea&rsquo;s throat it could
not go down the wrong throat!&mdash;unless, indeed, you have all 
of a sudden become inordinately selfish, and think that all the 
throats in the world are wrong ones except your own.&nbsp; 
However, don&rsquo;t talk so much, and hand me the pork before 
Jack finishes it.&nbsp; I feel myself entitled to at least one 
minute morsel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peterkin, you&rsquo;re a villain.&nbsp; A paltry little
villain,&rdquo; said Jack, quietly, as he tossed the hind legs 
(including the tail) of a cold roast pig to his comrade; 
&ldquo;and I must again express my regret that unavoidable 
circumstances have thrust your society upon me, and that 
necessity has compelled me to cultivate your acquaintance.&nbsp; 
Were it not that you are incapable of walking upon the water, I 
would order you, sir, out of the canoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! you&rsquo;ve wakened Avatea with your long 
tongue,&rdquo; retorted Peterkin, with a frown, as the girl gave 
vent to a deep sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he continued, 
&ldquo;it was only a snore.&nbsp; Perchance she dreameth of her 
black Apollo.&nbsp; I say, Ralph, do leave just one little slice 
of that yam.&nbsp; Between you and Jack I run a chance of being 
put on short allowance, if 
not&mdash;yei&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;ow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peterkin&rsquo;s concluding remark was a yawn of so great 
energy that Jack recommended him to postpone the conclusion of 
his meal till next morning,&mdash;a piece of advice which he 
followed so quickly, that I was forcibly reminded of his remark, 
a few minutes before, in regard to the sharp practice of 
Avatea.</p>
<p>My readers will have observed, probably, by this time, that I 
am much given to meditation; they will not, therefore, be 
surprised to learn that I fell into a deep reverie on the subject
of sleep, which was continued without intermission into the 
night, and prolonged without interruption into the following 
morning.&nbsp; But I cannot feel assured that I actually slept 
during that time, although I am tolerably certain that I was not 
awake.</p>
<p>Thus we lay like a shadow on the still bosom of the ocean, 
while the night closed in, and all around was calm, dark, and 
silent.</p>
<p>A thrilling cry of alarm from Peterkin startled us in the 
morning, just as the gray dawn began to glimmer in the east.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; cried Jack, starting up.</p>
<p>Peterkin replied by pointing with a look of anxious dread 
towards the horizon; and a glance sufficed to show us that one of
the largest sized war-canoes was approaching us!</p>
<p>With a groan of mingled despair and anger Jack seized his 
paddle, glanced at the compass, and, in a suppressed voice, 
commanded us to &ldquo;give way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we did not require to be urged.&nbsp; Already our four 
paddles were glancing in the water, and the canoe bounded over 
the glassy sea like a dolphin, while a shout from our pursuers 
told that they had observed our motions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see something like land ahead,&rdquo; said Jack, in a
hopeful tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems impossible that we could have
made the island yet; still, if it is so, we may reach it before 
these fellows can catch us, for our canoe is light and our 
muscles are fresh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one replied; for, to say truth, we felt that, in a long 
chase, we had no chance whatever with a canoe which held nearly a
hundred warriors.&nbsp; Nevertheless, we resolved to do our 
utmost to escape, and paddled with a degree of vigour that kept 
us well in advance of our pursuers.&nbsp; The war-canoe was so 
far behind us that it seemed but a little speck on the sea, and 
the shouts, to which the crew occasionally gave vent, came 
faintly towards us on the morning breeze.&nbsp; We therefore 
hoped that we should be able to keep in advance for an hour or 
two, when we might, perhaps, reach the land ahead.&nbsp; But this
hope was suddenly crushed by the supposed land, not long after, 
rising up into the sky; thus proving itself to be a fog-bank!</p>
<p>A bitter feeling of disappointment filled each heart, and was 
expressed on each countenance, as we beheld this termination to 
our hopes.&nbsp; But we had little time to think of regret.&nbsp;
Our danger was too great and imminent to permit of a 
moment&rsquo;s relaxation from our exertions.&nbsp; No hope now 
animated our bosoms; but a feeling of despair, strange to say, 
lent us power to work, and nerved our arms with such energy, that
it was several hours ere the savages overtook us.&nbsp; When we 
saw that there was indeed no chance of escape, and that paddling 
any longer would only serve to exhaust our strength, without 
doing any good, we turned the side of our canoe towards the 
approaching enemy, and laid down our paddles.</p>
<p>Silently, and with a look of bitter determination on his face,
Jack lifted one of the light boat-oars that we had brought with 
us, and, resting it on his shoulder, stood up in an attitude of 
bold defiance.&nbsp; Peterkin took the other oar and also stood 
up, but there was no anger visible on his countenance.&nbsp; When
not sparkling with fun, it usually wore a mild, sad expression, 
which was deepened on the present occasion, as he glanced at 
Avatea, who sat with her face resting in her hands upon her 
knees.&nbsp; Without knowing very well what I intended to do, I 
also arose and grasped my paddle with both hands.</p>
<p>On came the large canoe like a war-horse of the deep, with the
foam curling from its sharp bow, and the spear-heads of the 
savages glancing the beams of the rising sun.&nbsp; Perfect 
silence was maintained on both sides, and we could hear the 
hissing water, and see the frowning eyes of the warriors, as they
came rushing on.&nbsp; When about twenty yards distant, five or 
six of the savages in the bow rose, and, laying aside their 
paddles, took up their spears.&nbsp; Jack and Peterkin raised 
their oars, while, with a feeling of madness whirling in my 
brain, I grasped my paddle and prepared for the onset.&nbsp; But,
before any of us could strike a blow, the sharp prow of the 
war-canoe struck us like a thunderbolt on the side, and hurled us
into the sea!</p>
<p>What occurred after this I cannot tell, for I was nearly 
drowned; but when I recovered from the state of insensibility 
into which I had been thrown, I found myself stretched on my 
back, bound hand and foot between Jack and Peterkin, in the 
bottom of the large canoe.</p>
<p>In this condition we lay the whole day, during which time the 
savages only rested one hour.&nbsp; When night came, they rested 
again for another hour, and appeared to sleep just as they 
sat.&nbsp; But we were neither unbound nor allowed to speak to 
each other during the voyage, nor was a morsel of food or a 
draught of water given to us.&nbsp; For food, however, we cared 
little; but we would have given much for a drop of water to cool 
our parched lips, and we would have been glad, too, had they 
loosened the cords that bound us, for they were tightly fastened 
and occasioned us much pain.&nbsp; The air, also, was unusually 
hot, so much so that I felt convinced that a storm was 
brewing.&nbsp; This also added to our sufferings.&nbsp; However, 
these were at length relieved by our arrival at the island from 
which we had fled.</p>
<p>While we were being led ashore, we caught a glimpse of Avatea,
who was seated in the hinder part of the canoe.&nbsp; She was not
fettered in any way.&nbsp; Our captors now drove us before them 
towards the hut of Tararo, at which we speedily arrived, and 
found the chief seated with an expression on his face that boded 
us no good.&nbsp; Our friend the teacher stood beside him, with a
look of anxiety on his mild features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How comes it,&rdquo; said Tararo, turning to the 
teacher, &ldquo;that these youths have abused our 
hospitality?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; replied Jack, &ldquo;that we have not 
abused his hospitality, for his hospitality has not been extended
to us.&nbsp; I came to the island to deliver Avatea, and my only 
regret is that I have failed to do so.&nbsp; If I get another 
chance, I will try to save her yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The teacher shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, my young friend,
I had better not tell him that.&nbsp; It will only incense 
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear not,&rdquo; replied Jack.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you 
don&rsquo;t tell him that, you&rsquo;ll tell him nothing, for I 
won&rsquo;t say anything softer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing Jack&rsquo;s speech, Tararo frowned and his eye 
flashed with anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;presumptuous boy.&nbsp; My 
debt to you is cancelled.&nbsp; You and your companions shall 
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he rose and signed to several of his attendants, 
who seized Jack, and Peterkin, and me, violently by the collars, 
and, dragging us from the hut of the chief, led us through the 
wood to the outskirts of the village.&nbsp; Here they thrust us 
into a species of natural cave in a cliff, and, having barricaded
the entrance, left us in total darkness.</p>
<p>After feeling about for some time&mdash;for our legs were 
unshackled, although our wrists were still bound with 
thongs&mdash;we found a low ledge of rock running along one side 
of the cavern.&nbsp; On this we seated ourselves, and for a long 
time maintained unbroken silence.</p>
<p>At last I could restrain my feelings no longer.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Alas! dear Jack and Peterkin,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what 
is to become of us?&nbsp; I fear that we are doomed to 
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not,&rdquo; replied Jack, in a tremulous voice, 
&ldquo;I know not; Ralph, I regret deeply the hastiness of my 
violent temper, which, I must confess, has been the chief cause 
of our being brought to this sad condition.&nbsp; Perhaps the 
teacher may do something for us.&nbsp; But I have little 
hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! no,&rdquo; said Peterkin, with a heavy sigh; 
&ldquo;I am sure he can&rsquo;t help us.&nbsp; Tararo 
doesn&rsquo;t care more for him than for one of his 
dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there seems no chance of 
deliverance, unless the Almighty puts forth his arm to save 
us.&nbsp; Yet I must say that I have great hope, my comrades, for
we have come to this dark place by no fault of ours&mdash;unless 
it be a fault to try to succour a woman in distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was interrupted in my remarks by a noise at the entrance to 
the cavern, which was caused by the removal of the 
barricade.&nbsp; Immediately after, three men entered, and, 
taking us by the collars of our coats, led us away through the 
forest.&nbsp; As we advanced, we heard much shouting and beating 
of native drums in the village, and at first we thought that our 
guards were conducting us to the hut of Tararo again.&nbsp; But 
in this we were mistaken.&nbsp; The beating of drums gradually 
increased, and soon after we observed a procession of the natives
coming towards us.&nbsp; At the head of this procession we were 
placed, and then we all advanced together towards the temple 
where human victims were wont to be sacrificed!</p>
<p>A thrill of horror ran through my heart as I recalled to mind 
the awful scenes that I had before witnessed at that dreadful 
spot.&nbsp; But deliverance came suddenly from a quarter whence 
we little expected it.&nbsp; During the whole of that day there 
had been an unusual degree of heat in the atmosphere, and the sky
assumed that lurid aspect which portends a thunder-storm.&nbsp; 
Just as we were approaching the horrid temple, a growl of thunder
burst overhead and heavy drops of rain began to fall.</p>
<p>Those who have not witnessed gales and storms in tropical 
regions can form but a faint conception of the fearful hurricane 
that burst upon the island of Mango at this time.&nbsp; Before we
reached the temple, the storm burst upon us with a deafening 
roar, and the natives, who knew too well the devastation that was
to follow, fled right and left through the woods in order to save
their property, leaving us alone in the midst of the howling 
storm.&nbsp; The trees around us bent before the blast like 
willows, and we were about to flee in order to seek shelter, when
the teacher ran toward us with a knife in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank the Lord,&rdquo; he said, cutting our bonds, 
&ldquo;I am in time!&nbsp; Now, seek the shelter of the nearest 
rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This we did without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, for the 
whistling wind burst, ever and anon, like thunder-claps among the
trees, and, tearing them from their roots, hurled them with 
violence to the ground.&nbsp; Rain cut across the land in sheets,
and lightning played like forked serpents in the air; while, high
above the roar of the hissing tempest, the thunder crashed, and 
burst, and rolled in awful majesty.</p>
<p>In the village the scene was absolutely appalling.&nbsp; Roofs
were blown completely off the houses in many cases; and in 
others, the houses themselves were levelled with the 
ground.&nbsp; In the midst of this, the natives were darting to 
and fro, in some instances saving their goods, but in many others
seeking to save themselves from the storm of destruction that 
whirled around them.&nbsp; But, terrific although the tempest was
on land, it was still more tremendous on the mighty ocean.&nbsp; 
Billows sprang, as it were, from the great deep, and while their 
crests were absolutely scattered into white mist, they fell upon 
the beach with a crash that seemed to shake the solid land.&nbsp;
But they did not end there.&nbsp; Each successive wave swept 
higher and higher on the beach, until the ocean lashed its angry 
waters among the trees and bushes, and at length, in a sheet of 
white curdled foam, swept into the village and upset and carried 
off, or dashed into wreck, whole rows of the native 
dwellings!&nbsp; It was a sublime, an awful scene, calculated, in
some degree at least, to impress the mind of beholders with the 
might and the majesty of God.</p>
<p>We found shelter in a cave that night and all the next day, 
during which time the storm raged in fury; but on the night 
following it abated somewhat, and in the morning we went to the 
village to seek for food, being so famished with hunger that we 
lost all feeling of danger and all wish to escape in our desire 
to satisfy the cravings of nature.&nbsp; But no sooner had we 
obtained food than we began to wish that we had rather 
endeavoured to make our escape into the mountains.&nbsp; This we 
attempted to do soon afterwards, but the natives were now able to
look after us, and on our showing a disposition to avoid 
observation and make towards the mountains, we were seized by 
three warriors, who once more bound our wrists and thrust us into
our former prison.</p>
<p>It is true Jack made a vigorous resistance, and knocked down 
the first savage who seized him, with a well-directed blow of his
fist, but he was speedily overpowered by others.&nbsp; Thus we 
were again prisoners, with the prospect of torture and a violent 
death before us.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
<p>Imprisonment&mdash;Sinking hopes&mdash;Unexpected freedom to 
more than one, and in more senses than one.</p>
<p>For a long long month we remained in our dark and dreary 
prison, during which dismal time we did not see the face of a 
human being, except that of the silent savage who brought us our 
daily food.</p>
<p>There have been one or two seasons in my life during which I 
have felt as if the darkness of sorrow and desolation that 
crushed my inmost heart could never pass away, until death should
make me cease to feel the present was such a season.</p>
<p>During the first part of our confinement we felt a cold chill 
at our hearts every time we heard a foot-fall near the 
cave&mdash;dreading lest it should prove to be that of our 
executioner.&nbsp; But as time dragged heavily on, we ceased to 
feel this alarm, and began to experience such a deep, 
irrepressible longing for freedom, that we chafed and fretted in 
our confinement like tigers.&nbsp; Then a feeling of despair came
over us, and we actually longed for the time when the savages 
would take us forth to die!&nbsp; But these changes took place 
very gradually, and were mingled sometimes with brighter 
thoughts; for there were times when we sat in that dark cavern on
our ledge of rock and conversed almost pleasantly about the past,
until we well-nigh forgot the dreary present.&nbsp; But we seldom
ventured to touch upon the future.</p>
<p>A few decayed leaves and boughs formed our bed; and a scanty 
supply of yams and taro, brought to us once a-day, constituted 
our food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ralph, how have you slept?&rdquo; said Jack, in a
listless tone, on rising one morning from his humble couch.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Were you much disturbed by the wind last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I dreamed of home all night, 
and I thought that my mother smiled upon me, and beckoned me to 
go to her; but I could not, for I was chained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I dreamed, too,&rdquo; said Peterkin; &ldquo;but it
was of our happy home on the Coral Island.&nbsp; I thought we 
were swimming in the Water Garden; then the savages gave a yell, 
and we were immediately in the cave at Spouting Cliff, which, 
somehow or other, changed into this gloomy cavern; and I awoke to
find it true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peterkin&rsquo;s tone was so much altered by the depressing 
influence of his long imprisonment, that, had I not known it was 
he who spoke, I should scarcely have recognised it, so sad was 
it, and so unlike to the merry, cheerful voice we had been 
accustomed to hear.&nbsp; I pondered this much, and thought of 
the terrible decline of happiness that may come on human beings 
in so short a time; how bright the sunshine in the sky at one 
time, and, in a short space, how dark the overshadowing 
cloud!&nbsp; I had no doubt that the Bible would have given me 
much light and comfort on this subject, if I had possessed one, 
and I once more had occasion to regret deeply having neglected to
store my memory with its consoling truths.</p>
<p>While I meditated thus, Peterkin again broke the silence of 
the cave, by saying, in a melancholy tone, &ldquo;Oh, I wonder if
we shall ever see our dear island more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice trembled, and, covering his face with both hands, he
bent down his head and wept.&nbsp; It was an unusual sight for me
to see our once joyous companion in tears, and I felt a burning 
desire to comfort him; but, alas! what could I say?&nbsp; I could
hold out no hope; and although I essayed twice to speak, the 
words refused to pass my lips.&nbsp; While I hesitated, Jack sat 
down beside him, and whispered a few words in his ear, while 
Peterkin threw himself on his friend&rsquo;s breast, and rested 
his head on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Thus we sat for some time in deep silence.&nbsp; Soon after, 
we heard footsteps at the entrance of the cave, and immediately 
our jailer entered.&nbsp; We were so much accustomed to his 
regular visits, however, that we paid little attention to him, 
expecting that he would set down our meagre fare, as usual, and 
depart.&nbsp; But, to our surprise, instead of doing so, he 
advanced towards us with a knife in his hand, and, going up to 
Jack, he cut the thongs that bound his wrists, then he did the 
same to Peterkin and me!&nbsp; For fully five minutes we stood in
speechless amazement, with our freed hands hanging idly by our 
sides.&nbsp; The first thought that rushed into my mind was, that
the time had come to put us to death; and although, as I have 
said before, we actually wished for death in the strength of our 
despair, now that we thought it drew really near I felt all the 
natural love of life revive in my heart, mingled with a chill of 
horror at the suddenness of our call.</p>
<p>But I was mistaken.&nbsp; After cutting our bonds, the savage 
pointed to the cave&rsquo;s mouth, and we marched, almost 
mechanically, into the open air.&nbsp; Here, to our surprise, we 
found the teacher standing under a tree, with his hands clasped 
before him, and the tears trickling down his dark cheeks.&nbsp; 
On seeing Jack, who came out first, he sprang towards him, and 
clasping him in his arms, exclaimed,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! my dear young friend, through the great goodness of
God you are free!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Free!&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, free,&rdquo; repeated the teacher, shaking us 
warmly by the hands again and again; &ldquo;free to go and come 
as you will.&nbsp; The Lord has unloosed the bands of the captive
and set the prisoners free.&nbsp; A missionary has been sent to 
us, and Tararo has embraced the Christian religion!&nbsp; The 
people are even now burning their gods of wood!&nbsp; Come, my 
dear friends, and see the glorious sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We could scarcely credit our senses.&nbsp; So long had we been
accustomed in our cavern to dream of deliverance, that we 
imagined for a moment this must surely be nothing more than 
another vivid dream.&nbsp; Our eyes and minds were dazzled, too, 
by the brilliant sunshine, which almost blinded us after our long
confinement to the gloom of our prison, so that we felt giddy 
with the variety of conflicting emotions that filled our 
throbbing bosoms; but as we followed the footsteps of our sable 
friend, and beheld the bright foliage of the trees, and heard the
cries of the paroquets, and smelt the rich perfume of the 
flowering shrubs, the truth, that we were really delivered from 
prison and from death, rushed with overwhelming power into our 
souls, and, with one accord, while tears sprang to our eyes, we 
uttered a loud long cheer of joy.</p>
<p>It was replied to by a shout from a number of the natives who 
chanced to be near.&nbsp; Running towards us, they shook us by 
the hand with every demonstration of kindly feeling.&nbsp; They 
then fell behind, and, forming a sort of procession, conducted us
to the dwelling of Tararo.</p>
<p>The scene that met our eyes here was one that I shall never 
forget.&nbsp; On a rude bench in front of his house sat the 
chief.&nbsp; A native stood on his left hand, who, from his 
dress, seemed to be a teacher.&nbsp; On his right stood an 
English gentleman, who, I at once and rightly concluded, was a 
missionary.&nbsp; He was tall, thin, and apparently past forty, 
with a bald forehead, and thin gray hair.&nbsp; The expression of
his countenance was the most winning I ever saw, and his clear 
gray eye beamed with a look that was frank, fearless, loving, and
truthful.&nbsp; In front of the chief was an open space, in the 
centre of which lay a pile of wooden idols, ready to be set on 
fire; and around these were assembled thousands of natives, who 
had come to join in or to witness the unusual sight.&nbsp; A 
bright smile overspread the missionary&rsquo;s face as he 
advanced quickly to meet us, and he shook us warmly by the 
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am overjoyed to meet you, my dear young 
friends,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;My friend, and your friend,
the teacher, has told me your history; and I thank our Father in 
heaven, with all my heart, that he has guided me to this island, 
and made me the instrument of saving you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We thanked the missionary most heartily, and asked him in some
surprise how he had succeeded in turning the heart of Tararo in 
our favour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you that at a more convenient time,&rdquo; 
he answered, &ldquo;meanwhile we must not forget the respect due 
to the chief.&nbsp; He waits to receive you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the conversation that immediately followed between us and 
Tararo, the latter said that the light of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ had been sent to the island, and that to it we were 
indebted for our freedom.&nbsp; Moreover, he told us that we were
at liberty to depart in our schooner whenever we pleased, and 
that we should be supplied with as much provision as we 
required.&nbsp; He concluded by shaking hands with us warmly, and
performing the ceremony of rubbing noses.</p>
<p>This was indeed good news to us, and we could hardly find 
words to express our gratitude to the chief and to the 
missionary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what of Avatea?&rdquo; inquired Jack.</p>
<p>The missionary replied by pointing to a group of natives in 
the midst of whom the girl stood.&nbsp; Beside her was a tall, 
strapping fellow, whose noble mien and air of superiority bespoke
him a chief of no ordinary kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That youth is her lover.&nbsp; He came this very 
morning in his war-canoe to treat with Tararo for Avatea.&nbsp; 
He is to be married in a few days, and afterwards returns to his 
island home with his bride!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s capital,&rdquo; said Jack, as he stepped 
up to the savage and gave him a hearty shake of the hand.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;I wish you joy, my lad;&mdash;and you too, 
Avatea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Jack spoke, Avatea&rsquo;s lover took him by the hand and 
led him to the spot where Tararo and the missionary stood, 
surrounded by most of the chief men of the tribe.&nbsp; The girl 
herself followed, and stood on his left hand while her lover 
stood on his right, and, commanding silence, made the following 
speech, which was translated by the missionary:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young friend, you have seen few years, but your head is
old.&nbsp; Your heart also is large and very brave.&nbsp; I and 
Avatea are your debtors, and we wish, in the midst of this 
assembly, to acknowledge our debt, and to say that it is one 
which we can never repay.&nbsp; You have risked your life for one
who was known to you only for a few days.&nbsp; But she was a 
woman in distress, and that was enough to secure to her the aid 
of a Christian man.&nbsp; We, who live in these islands of the 
sea, know that the true Christians always act thus.&nbsp; Their 
religion is one of love and kindness.&nbsp; We thank God that so 
many Christians have been sent here&mdash;we hope many more will 
come.&nbsp; Remember that I and Avatea will think of you and pray
for you and your brave comrades when you are far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this kind speech Jack returned a short sailor-like reply, 
in which he insisted that he had only done for Avatea what he 
would have done for any woman under the sun.&nbsp; But 
Jack&rsquo;s forte did not lie in speech-making, so he terminated
rather abruptly by seizing the chief&rsquo;s hand and shaking it 
violently, after which he made a hasty retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, Ralph and Peterkin,&rdquo; said Jack, as we 
mingled with the crowd, &ldquo;it seems to me that the object we 
came here for having been satisfactorily accomplished, we have 
nothing more to do but get ready for sea as fast as we can, and 
hurrah for dear old England!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my idea precisely,&rdquo; said Peterkin, 
endeavouring to wink, but he had wept so much of late, poor 
fellow, that he found it difficult; &ldquo;however, I&rsquo;m not
going away till I see these fellows burn their gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peterkin had his wish, for, in a few minutes afterwards, fire 
was put to the pile, the roaring flames ascended, and, amid the 
acclamations of the assembled thousands, the false gods of Mango 
were reduced to ashes!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
<p>Conclusion.</p>
<p>To part is the lot of all mankind.&nbsp; The world is a scene 
of constant leave-taking, and the hands that grasp in cordial 
greeting to-day, are doomed ere long to unite for the last time, 
when the quivering lips pronounce the 
word&mdash;&ldquo;Farewell.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a sad thought, but
should we on that account exclude it from our minds?&nbsp; May 
not a lesson worth learning be gathered in the contemplation of 
it?&nbsp; May it not, perchance, teach us to devote our thoughts 
more frequently and attentively to that land where we meet, but 
part no more?</p>
<p>How many do we part from in this world with a light 
&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; whom we never see again!&nbsp; Often do I
think, in my meditations on this subject, that if we realized 
more fully the shortness of the fleeting intercourse that we have
in this world with many of our fellow-men, we would try more 
earnestly to do them good, to give them a friendly smile, as it 
were, in passing (for the longest intercourse on earth is little 
more than a passing word and glance), and show that we have 
sympathy with them in the short quick struggle of life, by our 
kindly words and looks and action.</p>
<p>The time soon drew near when we were to quit the islands of 
the South Seas; and, strange though it may appear, we felt deep 
regret at parting with the natives of the island of Mango; for, 
after they embraced the Christian faith, they sought, by showing 
us the utmost kindness, to compensate for the harsh treatment we 
had experienced at their hands; and we felt a growing affection 
for the native teachers and the missionary, and especially for 
Avatea and her husband.</p>
<p>Before leaving, we had many long and interesting conversations
with the missionary, in one of which he told us that he had been 
making for the island of Raratonga when his native-built sloop 
was blown out of its course, during a violent gale, and driven to
this island.&nbsp; At first the natives refused to listen to what
he had to say; but, after a week&rsquo;s residence among them, 
Tararo came to him and said that he wished to become a Christian,
and would burn his idols.&nbsp; He proved himself to be sincere, 
for, as we have seen, he persuaded all his people to do 
likewise.&nbsp; I use the word persuaded advisedly; for, like all
the other Feejee chiefs, Tararo was a despot and might have 
commanded obedience to his wishes; but he entered so readily into
the spirit of the new faith that he perceived at once the 
impropriety of using constraint in the propagation of it.&nbsp; 
He set the example, therefore; and that example was followed by 
almost every man of the tribe.</p>
<p>During the short time that we remained at the island, 
repairing our vessel and getting her ready for sea, the natives 
had commenced building a large and commodious church, under the 
superintendence of the missionary, and several rows of new 
cottages were marked out; so that the place bid fair to become, 
in a few months, as prosperous and beautiful as the Christian 
village at the other end of the island.</p>
<p>After Avatea was married, she and her husband were sent away, 
loaded with presents, chiefly of an edible nature.&nbsp; One of 
the native teachers went with them, for the purpose of visiting 
still more distant islands of the sea, and spreading, if 
possible, the light of the glorious gospel there.</p>
<p>As the missionary intended to remain for several weeks longer,
in order to encourage and confirm his new converts, Jack and 
Peterkin and I held a consultation in the cabin of our 
schooner,&mdash;which we found just as we had left her, for 
everything that had been taken out of her was restored.&nbsp; We 
now resolved to delay our departure no longer.&nbsp; The desire 
to see our beloved native land was strong upon us, and we could 
not wait.</p>
<p>Three natives volunteered to go with us to Tahiti, where we 
thought it likely that we should be able to procure a sufficient 
crew of sailors to man our vessel; so we accepted their offer 
gladly.</p>
<p>It was a bright clear morning when we hoisted the snow-white 
sails of the pirate schooner and left the shores of Mango.&nbsp; 
The missionary, and thousands of the natives, came down to bid us
God-speed, and to see us sail away.&nbsp; As the vessel bent 
before a light fair wind, we glided quickly over the lagoon under
a cloud of canvass.</p>
<p>Just as we passed through the channel in the reef the natives 
gave us a loud cheer; and as the missionary waved his hat, while 
he stood on a coral rock with his gray hairs floating in the 
wind, we heard the single word &ldquo;Farewell&rdquo; borne 
faintly over the sea.</p>
<p>That night, as we sat on the taffrail, gazing out upon the 
wide sea and up into the starry firmament, a thrill of joy, 
strangely mixed with sadness, passed through our 
hearts,&mdash;for we were at length &ldquo;homeward bound,&rdquo;
and were gradually leaving far behind us the beautiful, bright, 
green, coral islands of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
