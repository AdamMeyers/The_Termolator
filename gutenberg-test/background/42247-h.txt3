[Pg v]
PREFACE.


Though I intend this preface, prelude, or proem shall
occupy but a single page, and be a facile specimen of the
multum in parvo school, I find I have so little to say, I might
spare myself the trouble of saying that little, only it might
look a little odd (excuse my nibbing my pen) if, after writing
a book, which by the way, may prove no book at all, I
should introduce it to my readers,       did I say
       Readers?              what
a theme to dilate upon! But stop, stop, Mr. Exultation,
nobody may read your book, ergo, you will have
no readers. Humph! I must nib my pen again. Cooks,
grocers, butchers, kitchenmaids, the roast! Let brighter
visions rise: methink I see it grace every room Peckwater
round: methink I see, wherever mighty Tom sonorous
peals forth his solemn        Come, come, come!        the sons of
Oxon fly to Tallboys       
store, or Parker       s shelves, and cry        the Book,
the Book!        Methink I see in Granta       s
streets a crowd for Deighton       s and for Stevenson       s       anon,
[Pg vi]
       the Book, the Book,        they cry        Give us the Book!       
       Quips, Quirks, and Anecdotes?               Aye, that       s the
Book!        And, then, methink I see on Camus        side, or
where the Isis by her Christ Church glides, or Charwell       s
lowlier stream, methink I see (as did the Spanish Prince
of yore a son of Salamanca beat his brow) some togaed son
of Alma Mater beat, aye, laugh and beat his brow. And
then, like Philip, I demand the cause? And then he laughs
outright, and in my face he thrusts a book, and cries,
       Sir, read, read, read, ha, ha, ha, ha!        and stamps and
laughs the while;       and then, ye gods, it proves to be
the Book,       Quips, Quirks, and Anecdotes       ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha! I cry you mercy, Sirs, read, read, read, read! From
Eton, Harrow,
Winchester, and West,
come orders thick as Autumn leaves e       er fell, as larks at Dunstable,
or Egypt       s plagues. The Row is in commotion,       all the world rushes
by Amen Corner, or St. Paul       s: how like a summer-hive
they go and come: the very Chapter       s caught
the stirring theme, and, like King James at Christ Church, scents a
hum.[1]
E       en Caxton       s ghost stalks forth to beg a tome,
[Pg vii]
and Wynkyn       s shroud in vain protests his claims.        There       s
not a copy left,        cries Whitt       s or Long       s, as Caxton bolts
with the extremest tome, and Wynkyn, foiled, shrinks grimly into air,

Veil       d in a cloud of scarce black-letter lore.

Had Galen       s self, sirs, ab origine, or        sculapius, or the
modern school of Pharmacop      ians drugged their patients
thus, they long ago, aye, long ago, had starved; your undertakers
had been gone extinct, and churchyards turned
to gambol-greens, forsooth. Mirth, like good wine, no
help from physic needs:       blue devils and ennui! ha, ha,
ha, ha! Didst ever taste champagne? Then laugh, sirs,
laugh,              laugh and grow fat,        the maxim       s old and good:
the stars sang at their birth              Ha, ha, ha, ha!        I cry you
mercy, sirs, the Book, the Book, Quips, Quirks,
and Anecdotes. Oxonians hear!
       Ha, ha, ha, ha!        Let Granta,
too, respond. What would you more? the Book, sirs,
read, read, read.

       Tis true, my work       s a diamond in the rough, and that
there still are sparkling bits abroad, by wits whose wages
may not be to die, would make it, aye, the very Book of
[Pg viii]
Books! Let them, anon, to Cornhill wend their way
(p.p.) to cut a figure in
Ed. sec. 3d, or 4th, from Isis or from
Cam. What if they say, as Maudlin Cole of Boyle, because
some Christ-Church wits adorned his page with their
chaste learning,               Tis a Chedder cheese made of the milk
of all the parish,              Sirs, d       ye think I       d wince and call
them knave or fool? Methink I       d joy to spur them to the
task! Methink I see the mirth-inspired sons of Christ-Church
and the rest, penning Rich Puns, Bon-mots, and
Brave Conceits, for ages have, at Oxon,
       borne the bell,        and oft the table set in royal roar.
Methink I see the wits of Camus, too,
go laughing to the task,       and then, methink,
O! what a glorious toil were mine, at last, to send them
trumpet-tongued through all the world!

[1]
Sir Isaac Wake says in his Rex Platonicus, that when James the
First attended the performance of a play in the Hall of Christ-Church,
Oxford, the scholars applauded his Majesty by clapping
their hands and humming. The latter somewhat surprised the royal
auditor, but on its being explained to signify applause, he expressed
himself satisfied.

OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE
NUTS TO CRACK;
OR,
QUIPS, QUIRKS, ANECDOTE AND FACETE.



WAS OXFORD OR CAMBRIDGE FIRST FOUNDED?

       Oxford must from all antiquity have been either somewhere or nowhere.
Where was it in the time of Tarquinius Priscus? If it was nowhere, it
surely must have been somewhere. Where was it?              Faceti        Cant.

Here is a conundrum to unravel, or a nut to crack,
compared to which the D       dalean Labyrinth was a farce.
After so many of the learned have failed to extract the
kernel, though by no means deficient in what Gall and
Spurzheim would call jawitiveness (as their writings will
sufficiently show,) I should approach it with        fear and
trembling,        did I not remember the encouraging reproof
of        Queen Bess        to Sir Walter Raleigh       s        Fain would
I climb but that I fear to fall              so dentals to the task,
come what may. A new light has been thrown upon the
subject of late, in an unpublished        Righte Merrie Comedie,       
entitled        Trinity College, Cambridge,        from which
I extract the following


[Pg 14]
JEU DE POESIE.


When first our Alma Mater rose,
Though we must laud her and love her,
Nobody cares, and nobody knows,
And nobody can discover:
Some say a Spaniard, one Cantaber,
Christen       d her, or gave birth to her,
Or his daughter       that       s likelier, more, by far,
Though some honour king Brute above her.

Pythagoras, beans-consuming dog,
(       Tis the tongue of tradition that speaks,)
Built her a lecture-room fit for a hog,[2]
Where now they store cabbage and leeks:
And there mathematics he taught us, they say,
Till catching a cold on a dull rainy day,
He packed up his tomes, and he ran away
To the land of his fathers, the Greeks.

But our Alma Mater still can boast,
Although the old Grecian would go,
Of glorious names a mighty host,
You       ll find in Wood, Fuller and Coe:
Of whom I will mention but just a few       
Bacon, and Newton, and Milton will do:
There are thousands more, I assure you,
Whose honours encircle her brow.

Then long may our Alma Mater reign,
Of learning and science the star,
Whether she were from Greece or Spain,
Or had a king Brute for her Pa;
And with Oxon, her sister, for aye preside,
For it never was yet by man denied,
That the world can       t show the like beside,       
Let echo repeat it afar!



[2]
The School of Pythagoras is an ancient building, situated behind
St. John       s College, Cambridge, wherein the old Grecian, says tradition,
lectured before Cambridge became a university. Whether
those who say so lie under a mistake, as Tom Hood would say, I am
not now going to inquire. At any rate,        sic transit,        the building
is now a barn or storehouse for garden stuff. Those who would be
further acquainted with this relique of by-gone days, may read a very
interesting account of it extant in the Library of the British Museum,
illustrated with engravings, and written by a Fellow of Merton
College, Oxford, to which society, says Wilson, in his Memorabilia
Catabrigi       ,        it was given by Edward IV., who took it from
King       s College, Cambridge. It is falsely supposed to have been one
of the places where the Croyland Monks read lectures.       

[Pg 15]
It matters little whether we sons of Alma Mater sprung
from the loins of Pythagoras, Cantaber, or the kings Brute
and Alfred. They were all respectable in their way, so
that we need not blush,        proh pudor,        to own their paternity.
But let us hear what the cutting writer of Terr       
Filius has to say on the subject.        Grievous and terrible
has been the squabble, amongst our chronologers and genealogists
concerning



THE PRECEDENCE OF OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE.

What deluges of Christian ink have been shed on both
sides in this weighty controversy, to prove which is the
elder of the two learned and most ingenious ladies? It is
wonderful to see that they should always be making themselves
older than they really are; so contrary to most of
their sex, who love to conceal their wrinkles and gray
hairs as much as they can; whereas these two aged matrons
are always quarrelling for seniority, and employing
counsel to plead their causes for        em. These are Old Nick
Cantalupe and Caius on one side, and Bryan Twynne and
Tony Wood on the other, who, with equal learning, deep
penetration, and acuteness, have traced their ages back,
God knows how far: one was born just after the siege of
Troy, and the other several hundred years before Christ;
since which time they have gone by as many names as the
pretty little bantling at Rome, or the woman that was
hanged t       other day in England, for having twenty-three
husbands. Oxford, say they, was the daughter of Mempricius,
an old British King, who called her from his own
name, Caer Memprick, alias Greeklade, alias Leechlade,
alias Rhidycen, alias Bellositum, alias Oxenforde, alias
Oxford, as all great men       s children have several names.
So was Cambridge, say others, the daughter of one Cantaber,
a Spanish rebel and fugitive, who called her Caergrant,
alias Cantabridge, alias Cambridge. But, that I
may not affront either of these old ladies,        adds this facetious
but sarcastic writer,        I will not take it upon me to
decide which of the two hath most wrinkles * * * *.
Who knows but they may be twins.       

Another authority, the author of the History of Cambridge, published
by Ackermann, in 1815, says that


[Pg 16]

THIS CELEBRATED CONTROVERSY

Had its origin in 1564, when Queen Elizabeth visited the
University of Cambridge, and        the Public Orator, addressing
Her Majesty, embraced the opportunity of extolling
the antiquity of the University to which he belonged above
that of Oxford. This occasioned Thomas Key, Master of
University, College, Oxford, to compose a small treatise
on the antiquity of his own University, which he referred
to the fabulous period when the Greek professors accompanied
Brute to England; and to the less ambiguous era of
870, when Science was invited to the banks of the Isis,
under the auspices of the great Alfred. A MS. copy of
this production of Thomas Key accidentally came into the
hands of the Earl of Leicester, from whom it passed into
those of Dr. John Caius (master and founder of Gonvile
and Caius Colleges, Cambridge,) who, resolving not to be
vanquished in asserting the chronological claims of his own
University, undertook to prove the foundation of Cambridge
by Cantaber, nearly four hundred years before the
Christian era. He thus assigned the birth of Cambridge
to more than 1200 anterior to that which had been secondarily
ascribed to Oxford by the champion of that seat of
learning; and yet it can be hardly maintained that he had
the best of the argument, since the primary foundation by
the son of        neas, it is evident, remains unimpeached, and
the name of Brute, to say the least of it, is quite as creditable
as that of Cantaber. The work which Dr. John Caius
published, though under a feigned name, along with that
which it was written to refute, was entitled,        De Antiquitate
Catabrigiensis Academi       , libri ii. in quorum 2do. de
Oxoniensis quoque gymnasii antiquitate disseritur, et Cantabrigiense
longe eo antiquius esse definitur, Londinense
Authore: adjunximus assertionem antiquitatis Oxoniensis
Academi        ab Oxoniensi quodam annis jam elapsis duobus
ad reginam conscriptam in qua docere conatur, Oxoniense
gymnasium Cantabrigiensi antiquius esse: ut ex collatione
facile intelligas, utra sit antequior. Excusum Londini,
A. D. 1568, Mense Augusto, per Henricum Bynnenum,
12mo.               and is extant in the British Museum. As may
[Pg 17]
well be supposed by those who are acquainted with the progress
of literary warfare, this work of Dr. John Caius drew
from his namesake, Thomas Caius, a vindication of that
which it was intended to refute; and this work he entitled
       Thom        Caii Vindici        Antiquitatis Academi        Oxoniensis
contra Joannem Caium Cantabrigiensem.        These
two singular productions were subsequently published together
by Hearne, the Oxford antiquary, who, with a prejudice
natural enough, boasts that the forcible logic of the
Oxford advocate        broke the heart and precipitated the
death of his Cambridge antagonist.        In other words, Dr.
John Caius, it is said,


DIED OF LITERARY MORTIFICATION,

On learning that his Oxford opponent had prepared a new
edition of his work, to be published after his death, in which
he was told were some arguments thought to bear hard on
his own.        But this appears to have as little foundation as
other stories of the kind,        says the editor of the History
just quoted;        since it is not probable that Dr. John Caius
ever saw the strictures which are said to have occasioned
his death: for, as Thomas Caius died in 1572, they remained
in MS. till they were published by Hearne in 1730;              a
conclusion, however, to which our learned historian
seems to have jumped rather hastily, as it was just as possible
that a MS. copy reached Dr. John Caius in the second
as in the first case; and it is natural to suppose that the Oxford
champion would desire it should be so. As a specimen
of the manner in which such controversies are conducted,
I conclude with the brief notice, that Tony Wood, as the
author of Terr       -Fillius calls him, has largely treated of
the subject in his Annals of Oxford, where he states, that


SIR SIMON D       EWES,

When compiling his work on the antiquity of the University
of Cambridge,        thought he should be able to set
abroad a new matter, that was never heard of before, for
the advancement of his own town and University of Cambridge
above Oxford;        but        hath done very little or nothing
[Pg 18]
else but renewed the old Crambe, and taken up Dr.
Cay       s old song, running with him in his opinions and tenets,
whom he before condemning of dotage, makes himself by
consequence a dotard.        According to Sir Simon,        Valence
College (i. e. Pembroke Hall) was the first endowed
college in England;               his avouching which,        says Wood,
       is of no force;        and he, as might be expected, puts in a
claim for his own college (Merton, of Oxford,)        which,       
he adds,        Sir Simon might have easily known, had he been
conversant with histories, was the oldest foundation in
either University.        Therefore,        if the antiquity of Cambridge
depends upon Valence College (or rather, upon Peter
House,) and that house upon this distich, which stood
for a public inscription in the parlour window thereof, it
signifies nothing:       


       Qua pr       it Oxoniam Cancestria longa vetustas
Primatus a Petri dicitur orsa Domo.       


He finally overwhelms his opponent by adding, that Oxford
became a public University in 1264, and that a bull for the
purpose was obtained the previous year, Cambridge then
       being but an obscure place of learning, if any at all.       
Thus I have cracked Nut the First. Those who would
add        sweets to the sweets        may find them in abundance
in the writers I have named already; and the subject is
treated of very learnedly by Dyer, in his Dedication to his
       Privileges of the University of Cambridge.       



GONE TO JERUSALEM.

A learned living oriental scholar, and a senior fellow of
St. John       s College, Cambridge, who thinks less of journeying
to Shiraz, Timbuctoo, or the Holy Land, than a Cockney
would of a trip to Greenwich Fair or Bagnigge Wells,
kept in the same court, in College, with a late tutor, now
the amiable rector of Staple              t, in Kent. It was their
daily practice, when in residence, to take a ramble together,
by the footpaths, round by Granchester, and back
to College by Trumpington, or to Madingley, or the Hills,
[Pg 19]
but more commonly the former; all delightful in their
way, and well known to gownsmen for various associations.
To one of these our College dons daily wended
their way cogitating, for they never talked, it is said, over
the omnia magna of Cambridge life. Their invariable
practice was to keep moving at a stiff pace, some four or
five yards in advance of each other. Our amiable tutor
went one forenoon to call on Mr. P. before starting, as
usual, and found his door sported. This staggered him a
little. Mr. P.       s bed-maker chanced to come up at the instant.
       Where is Mr. P.?        was his query.        Gone out,
sir,        was the reply.        Gone out!        exclaimed Mr. H.;
       Where to?               To Jerusalem,        she rejoined. And to
Jerusalem he was gone, sure enough; a circumstance of so
little import in his eyes, who had seen most parts of the
ancient world already, and filled the office of tutor to an
Infanta of Spain, that he did not think it matter worth the
notice of his College Chum. Other travellers,        vox et
ratio,        as Horace says, would have had the circumstance
bruited in every periodical in Christendom,        quinque sequuntur
te pueri.       



A CUTTING RETORT

Is attributed to the celebrated Lord Chesterfield, when a
student of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he is said to
have studied hard, and rose daily, in the depth of winter,
at four or five. He one day met a drunken fellow in the
streets of Cambridge, who refused him the wall, observing,
       I never give the wall to a rascal.               I do,        retorted his
Lordship, moving out of the way. It was probably this
incident that gave rise to the couplet       


       Base man to take the wall I ne       er permit.       
The scholar said,        I do;        and gave him it.



[Pg 20]

LIBERTY A PLANT.


       Qui teneros CAULES alieni fregerit horti.              Hor.


During the progress of a political meeting held in the
town of Cambridge, it so happened that the late Dr. Mansel,
then Public Orator of the University of Cambridge,
but afterwards Master of Trinity College and Bishop of
Bristol, came to the place of meeting just as Musgrave,
the well known political tailor of his day, was in the midst
of a most pathetic oration, and emphatically repeating,
       Liberty, liberty, gentlemen               He paused,              Liberty
is a plant                      So is a cabbage!        exclaimed the caustic
Mansel, before Musgrave had time to complete his sentence,
with so happy an allusion to the trade of the tailor,
that he was silenced amidst roars of laughter. Another
instance of       


A TAILOR BEING TAKEN BY SURPRISE,

But by an Oxonian, a learned member of Christ Church,
is recorded in the fact, that having, for near half a century,
been accustomed to walk with a favourite stick, the
ferule of which, at the bottom, came off, he took it to his
tailor to have it repaired.



REASONS FOR NOT PUBLISHING.

The famous antiquary, Thomas Baker, B.D. of St.
John       s College, Cambridge, of which he was long Socius
Ejectus, lays it down as a principle, in his admirable Reflections
on Learning,        that if we had fewer books, we
should have more learning.        It is singular that he never
published but the one book named, though he has left behind
him forty-two volumes of manuscripts, the greater
part in the Harleian Collection, in the British Museum,
principally relating to Cambridge, and all neatly written
in his own hand.



DECLINING KING GEORGE.

When        honest Vere        Foster, as he is called by        mild
[Pg 21]
William,        his contemporary at College, and the grandfather
of our celebrated traveller, Dr. Edward Daniel Clarke,
was a student at Cambridge, where he was celebrated for
his wit and humour, and for being a good scholar, St.
John       s being looked upon as a Tory college, a young fellow,
a student, reputed a Whig, was appointed to deliver
an oration in the College Hall, on the 5th of November.
This he did; but having, for some time, dwelt on the double
deliverance of that day, in his peroration, he passed
from King William to King George, on whom he bestowed
great encomiums. When the speech was over, honest
Vere and the orator being at table together, the former addressed
the latter with,        I did not imagine, sir, that you
would decline King George in your speech.               Decline!       
said the astonished orator;        what do you mean? I spoke
very largely and handsomely of him.               That is what I mean, too,
sir,        said Vere:        for you had him in every case and termination:
Georgius       Georgii       Georgio       Georgium       O Georgi!       

Another of        honest Vere       s       


CLASSICAL JEU D       ESPRIT

Is deserving a place in our treasury. He one day asked
his learned college contemporary, Dr. John Taylor, editor
of Demosthenes,        why he talked of selling his horse?       
       Because,        replied the doctor,        I cannot afford to keep
him in these hard times.               You should keep a mare,       
rejoined Foster,        according to Horace       


              quam memento rebus in arduis
Servare.              




A TRAIT OF BARROW.

Soon after that great, good, and loyal son of Granta, Dr.
Isaac Barrow, was made a prebend of Salisbury, says Dr.
Pope,        I overheard him say,        I wish I had five hundred
pounds.               That       s a large sum for a philosopher,        observed
Dr. Pope;        what would you do with so much?               I
would,        said he,        give it to my sister for a portion, that
[Pg 22]
would procure her a good husband.        A few months after,       
adds his memorialist,        he was made happy by receiving
the above sum,        which he so much desired,        for
putting a new life into the corps of his new prebend.       



INVETERATE SMOKERS.

Both Oxford and Cambridge have been famous for inveterate
smokers. Amongst them was the learned Dr.
Isaac Barrow, who said        it helped his thinking.        His illustrious
pupil, Newton, was scarcely less addicted to the
       Indian weed,        and every body has heard of his hapless
courtship, when, in a moment of forgetfulness, he popped
the lady       s finger into his burning pipe, instead of popping
the question, and was so chagrined, that he never could be
persuaded to press the matter further. Dr. Parr was allowed
his pipe when he dined with the first gentleman in
Europe, George the Fourth, and when refused the same indulgence
by a lady at whose house he was staying, he told
her,        she was the greatest tobacco-stopper he had ever met
with.        The celebrated Dr. Farmer, of black-letter memory,
preferred the comforts of the parlour of Emmanuel
College, of which he was master, and a        yard of clay       
(there were no hookahs in his day,) to a bishopric, which
dignity he twice refused, when offered to him by Mr. Pitt.
Another learned


LOVER OF TOBACCO,

And eke of wit, mirth, puns, and pleasantry, was the famous
Dr. Aldrich, Dean of Christ Church, Oxford, the
never-to-be-forgotten composer of the good old catch       


       Hark, the merry Christ-Church bells,       


and of another to be sung by four men smoking their
pipes, which is not more difficult to sing than diverting to
hear. His pipe was his breakfast, dinner, and supper, and
a student of Christ Church, at 10 o       clock one night, finding
it difficult to persuade a        freshman        of the fact, laid him


[Pg 23]
A WAGER,

That the Dean was at that instant smoking. Away he
hurried to the deanery to decide the controversy, and on
gaining admission, apologised for his intrusion by relating
the occasion of it.        Well,        replied the Dean, in perfect
good humour, with his pipe in his hand,        you see you have
lost your wager: for I am not smoking, but filling my
pipe.       



GAME IN EVERY BUSH.

Bishop Watson says, in his valuable Chemical Essays,
that        Sir Isaac Newton and Dr. Bentley met accidentally
in London, and on Sir Isaac       s inquiring what philosophical
pursuits were carrying on at Cambridge, the doctor replied,
       None; for when you are a-hunting, Sir Isaac, you
kill all the game; you have left us nothing to pursue.       
       Not so,        said the philosopher,        you may start a variety
of game in every bush, if you will but take the trouble to
beat it.               And so in truth it is,        adds Dr. W.;        every
object in nature affords occasion for philosophical experiment.       



NEWTON       S TOAST.

The Editor of the Literary Panorama, says Corneille Le
Bruyer, the famous Dutch painter, relates, that        happening
one day to dine at the table of Newton, with other foreigners,
when the dessert was sent up, Newton proposed,
       a health to the men of every country who believed in a
God;        which,        says the editor,        was drinking the health of
the whole human race.        Equal to this was


THE PIETY OF RAY,

The celebrated naturalist and divine, who (when ejected
from his fellowship of Trinity College, Cambridge, for non-conformity,
and, for the same reason, being no longer at
[Pg 24]
liberty to exercise his clerical functions as a preacher of
the Gospel,) turned to the pursuit of the sciences of
natural philosophy and botany for consolation.        Because
I could no longer serve God in the church,        said this great
and good man (in his Preface to the Wisdom of God manifested
in the Works of the Creation,)        I thought myself
more bound to do it by my writings.       



THE DEVIL LOOKING OVER LINCOLN.


Is a tradition of many ages        standing, but the origin of the
celebrated statue of his Satanic Majesty, which of erst
overlooked Lincoln College, Oxford, is not so certain as
that the effigy was popular, and gave rise to the saying.
After outstanding centuries of hot and cold, jibes and jeers,
       cum multis aliis,        to which stone, as well as flesh, is heir,
it was taken down on the 15th of November, 1731, says a
writer in the Gentleman       s Magazine, having lost its head
in a storm about two years previously, at the same time the
head was blown off the statue of King Charles the First,
which overlooked Whitehall.



RADCLIFFE       S LIBRARY.

Tom Warton relates, in his somewhat rambling Life of
Dr. Ralph Bathurst, President of Trinity College, Oxford,
that Dr. Radcliffe was a student of Lincoln College when
Dr. B. presided over Trinity; but notwithstanding their
difference of age and distance of situation, the President
used to visit the young student at Lincoln College        merely
for the smartness of his conversation.        During one of
these morning or evening calls, Dr. B. observing the embryo
physician had but few books in his chambers, asked
him        Where was his study?        upon which young Radcliffe
replied, pointing to a few books, a skeleton, and a herbal,
       This, Sir, is Radcliffe       s library.        Tom adds the following


[Pg 25]
TRAITS OF DR. BATHURST       S WIT AND HABITS.

When the Doctor was Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, a captain
of a company, who had fought bravely in the cause of
his royal master, King Charles the First, being recommended
to him for the degree of D.C.L., the doctor told
the son of Mars he could not confer the degree,        but he
would apply to his majesty to give him a regiment of
horse!       


HE FREQUENTLY CARRIED A WHIP IN HIS HAND,

An instrument of correction not entirely laid aside in our
universities in his time; but (says Tom) he only        delighted
to surprise scholars, when walking in the grove at unseasonable
hours. This he practised,        adds Warton,        on account
of the pleasure he took in giving so odd an alarm,
rather than from any principle of reproving, or intention of
applying so illiberal a punishment.        One thing is certain,
that in the statutes of Trinity College, Oxford (as late as
1556,) scholars of the foundation are ordered to be


WHIPPED EVEN TO THE TWENTIETH YEAR.

       Dr. Potter,        says Aubery, while a tutor of the above
college,        whipped his pupil with his sword by his side, when
he came to take his leave of him to go to the Inns of Court.       
This was done to make him a smart fellow.        In Sir John
Fane       s collection of letters of the Paston family, written
temp. Henry VI.,        says the author of the Gradus ad Catabrigiam,
       we find one of the gentle sex prescribing
for her son, who was at Cambridge,        no doubt with a maternal
anxiety that he should


BE A SMART FELLOW,

as follows:              Prey Grenefield to send me faithfully worde
by wrytyn, who (how) Clemit Paston hathe do his dever i       
lernying, and if he hath nought do well, nor will nought
amend, prey hym that he wyll truely BELASH hym tyl he wyll
amend, and so dyd the last mastyr, and the best eu        he had
at Cambridge.        And that Master Grenefield might not
[Pg 26]
want due encouragement, she concludes with promising him
       X m       rs,        for his pains. We do not, however, learn how
many marks young Master Clemit received, who certainly
took more pains.       Patiendo non faciendo       Ferendo non
feriendo.



MILTON WAS BELASHED

over the buttery-hatch of Christ-College, Cambridge, and,
as Dr. Johnson insinuates in his Life, was the last Cambridge
student so castigated in either university. The officer
who performed this fundamental operation was Dr.
Thomas Bainbrigge, the master of Christ       s College. But
as it was at a later date that Dr. Ralph Bathurst carried his
whip, according to our friend Tom       s showing, to surprise
the scholars, it is therefore going a great length to give our
       Prince of Poets        the sole merit of being the last smart fellow
that issued from the halls of either Oxford or Cambridge,
handsome as he was.

The following celebrated


EPIGRAM ON AN EPIGRAM,

Printed, says the Oxford Sausage,        from the original MSS.
preserved in the ARCHIVES of the Jelly-bag Society,        is
somewhere said to have been written by Dr. Ralph Bathurst,
when an Oxford scholar:       


One day in Christ-church meadows walking,
Of poetry and such things talking,
Says Ralph, a merry wag,
An EPIGRAM, if right and good,
In all its circumstances should
Be like a JELLY-BAG.

Your simile, I own, is new,
But how dost make it out? quoth Hugh.
Quoth Ralph, I       ll tell you, friend:
Make it at top both wide and fit
To hold a budget full of wit,
And point it at the end.



[Pg 27]

TELL US WHAT YOU CAN       T DO?

A party of Oxford scholars were one evening carousing
at the Star Inn, when a waggish student, a stranger to them,
abruptly introduced himself, and seeing he was not        one
of us,        they all began to quiz him. This put him upon his
mettle, and besides boasting of other accomplishments, he
told them, in plain terms, that he could write Greek or
Latin Verses better, and was, in short, an over-match for
them at any thing. Upon this, one of the party exclaimed,
       You have told us a great deal of what you can do, tell us
something you can       t do?               Well,        he retorted,        I       ll tell
you what I can       t do       I can       t pay my reckoning!        This
sally won him a hearty welcome.



THE FIRST WOMEN INTRODUCED INTO A CLOISTER.

About 1550, whilst the famous Richard Cox, Bishop of
Ely, was Dean of Christ-church, Oxford, says Cole, in his
Athen        Cant.,        he brought his wife into the college, who,
with the wife of Peter Martyr, a canon of the same cathedral,
were observed to be the first women ever introduced
into a cloister or college, and, upon that account,
gave no small scandal at the time.        This reminds me of
an anecdote that used to amuse the under-grads in my day
at Cambridge. A certain D.D., head of a college, a bachelor,
and in his habits retired to a degree of solitariness, in
an unlucky moment gave a lady that did not want twice
bidding, not bill of exchange, but a running invitation to
the college lodge, to be used at pleasure. She luckily seized
the long vacation for making her appearance, when there
were but few students in residence; but to the confusion
of our D.D., her ten daughters came en traine, and the college
was not a little scandalized by their playing shuttlecock
in the open court       the lady was in no haste to go.
Report says sundry hints were given in vain. She took
his original invite in its literal sense, to        suit her own convenience.       
The anxiety he endured threw our modest
D.D. in to a sick-bed, and not relishing the office of nurse
[Pg 28]
to a bachelor of sixty years        standing, she decamped, + her
ten daughters.



THE CAMBRIDGE SCHOLAR AND THE GHOST OF A
SCRAG OF MUTTON.


In the days that are past, by the side of a stream,
Where waters but softly were flowing,
With ivy o       ergrown an old mansion-house stood,
That was built on the skirts of a chilling damp wood,
Where the yew-tree and cypress were growing.

The villagers shook as they passed by the doors,
When they rested at eve from their labours;
And the traveller many a furlong went round,
If his ears once admitted the terrific sound,
Of the tale that was told by the neighbours.

They said,        that the house in the skirts of the wood
By a saucer-eyed ghost was infested,
Who filled every heart with confusion and fright,
By assuming strange shapes at the dead of the night,
Shapes monstrous, and foul, and detested.       

And truly they said, and the monster well knew,
That the ghost was the greatest of evils;
For no sooner the bell of the mansion toll       d one,
Than the frolicksome imp in a fury begun
To caper like ten thousand devils.

He appeared in forms the most strange and uncouth,
Sure never was goblin so daring!
He utter       d loud shrieks and most horrible cries,
Curst his body and bones, and his sweet little eyes,
Till his impudence grew beyond bearing.

Just at this nick o        time, when the master       s sad heart
With anguish and sorrow was swelling,
He heard that a scholar with science complete,
Full of magical lore as an egg       s full of meat,
At Cambridge had taken a dwelling.

The scholar was versed in all magical arts,
Most famous was he throughout college;
To the Red Sea full oft many an unquiet ghost,
To repose with King Pharaoh and his mighty host
He had sent through his powerful knowledge.

To this scholar so learn       d the master he went,
And as lowly he bent with submission,
[Pg 29]Told the freaks of the horrible frights
That prevented his household from resting at nights,
And offered this humble petition:       

       That he, the said scholar, in wisdom so wise,
Would the mischievous fiend lay in fetters;
Would send him in torments for ever to dwell,
In the nethermost pit of the nethermost hell,
For destroying the sleep of his betters.       

The scholar so versed in all magical lore,
Told the master his pray       r should be granted;
He ordered his horse to be saddled with speed,
And perch       d on the back of his cream colour       d steed,
Trotted off to the house that was haunted.

       Bring me turnips and milk!        the scholar he cried,
In voice like the echoing thunder:
He brought him some turnips and suet beside,
Some milk and a spoon, and his motions they eyed,
Quite lost in conjecture and wonder.

He took up the turnips, and peel       d off the skins,
Put them into a pot that was boiling;
Spread a table and cloth, and made ready to sup,
Then call       d for a fork, and the turnips fished up
In a hurry, for they were a-spoiling.

He mash       d up the turnips with butter and milk:
The hail at the casement        gan clatter!
Yet this scholar ne       er heeded the tempest without,
But raising his eyes, and turning about,
Asked the maid for a small wooden platter.

He mash       d up the turnips with butter and salt,
The storm came on thicker and faster       
The lightnings went flash, and with terrific din
The wind at each crevice and cranny came in,
Tearing up by the root lath and plaster.

He mash       d up the turnips with nutmegs and spice,
The mess would have ravish       d a glutton;
When lo! with sharp bones hardly covered with skin,
The ghost from a nook o       er the window peep       d in,
In the form of a boil       d scrag of mutton.

       Ho! Ho!        said the ghost,        what art doing below?       
The scholar peep       d up in a twinkling       
       The times are too hard to afford any meat,
So to render my turnips more pleasant to eat,
A few grains of pepper I       m sprinkling.       
[Pg 30]
Then he caught up a fork, and the mutton he seiz       d,
And soused it at once in the platter;
Threw o       er it some salt and a spoonful of fat,
And before the poor ghost could tell what he was at,
He was gone like a mouse down the throat of a cat,
And this is the whole of the matter.




COMPARISONS ARE ODIOUS.

Doctor John Franklin, Fellow and Master of Sidney
College, Cambridge, 1730,        a very fat, rosy-complexioned
man,        dying soon after he was made Dean of Ely, and
being succeeded by Dr. Ellis,        a meagre, weasel-faced,
swarthy, black man,        the Fenman of Ely, says (Cole) in
allusion thereto, out of vexation at being so soon called upon
for recognition money, made the following humorous
distitch:       


       The Devil took our Dean,
And pick       d his bones clean;
Then clapt him on a board,
And sent him back again.

Sir Isaac Pennington and Sir Busick Harwood were cotemporary
at Cambridge. The first as Regius Professor
of Physic and Senior Fellow of St. John       s College, the
other was Professor of Anatomy and Fellow of Downing
College. Both were eminent in their way, but seldom
agreed, and held each other       s abilities pretty cheap, some
say in sovereign contempt. Sir Busick was once called in
by the friends of a patient that had been under Sir Isaac       s
care, but had obtained small relief, anxious to hear his opinion
of the malady. Not approving of the treatment pursued,
[Pg 31]
he inquired        who was the physician in attendance,       
and on being told, exclaimed              He! If he were to descend
into a patient       s stomach with a candle and lantern, he
would not have been able to name the complaint!       


THIS DIFFERENCE OF OPINION

Was hit off, it is supposed, not by Dean Swift or wicked
Will Whiston, but by Bishop Mansel, as follows:       


Sir Isaac,
Sir Busick;
Sir Busick,
Sir Isaac;
       Twould make you and I sick
To taste their physick.


Another, perhaps the same Cambridge wag, penned the following
quaternion on Sir Isaac, which appeared under the title of


AN EPIGRAM ON A PETIT-MAITRE PHYSICIAN.


When Pennington for female ills indites,
Studying alone not what, but how he writes,
The ladies, as his graceful form they scan,
Cry, with ill-omen       d rapture,        killing man!       


But Sir Isaac, too, was a wit, and chanced on a time to be
one of a Cambridge party, amongst whom was a rich old
fellow, an invalid, who was too mean to buy an opinion on
his case, and thought it a good opportunity to worm one
out of Sir Isaac gratis. He accordingly seized the opportunity
for reciting the whole catalogue of his ills, ending
with,        what would you advise me to take, my dear Sir
Isaac?               I should recommend you to take advice,        was the
reply.



PORSON,

Whose very name conjures up the spirits of ten thousand
wits, holding both sides, over a copus of Trinity ale and a
classical pun, would not only frequently        steal a few
hours from the night,        but see out both lights and liquids,
[Pg 32]
and seem none the worse for the carouse. He had one night
risen for the purpose of reaching his hat from a peg to depart,
after having finished the port, sherry, gin-store,      c.,
when he espied a can of beer, says Dyer, (surely it must
have been audit,) in a corner. Restoring his hat to its resting
place, he reseated himself with the following happy
travestie of the old nursery lines       


       When wine is gone, and ale is spent,
Then small beer is most excellent.       


It was no uncommon thing for his gyp to enter his room
with Ph      bus, and find him still en robe, with no other companions
but a Homer,        schylus, Plato, and a dozen or
two other old Grecians surrounding an empty bottle, or
what his late Royal Highness the Duke of York would have
styled        a marine,        id est        a good fellow, who had done his
duty, and was ready to do it again.        Upon his gyp once
peeping in before day light, and finding him still up, Porson
answered his        quod petis?        (whether he wanted candles
or liquor,) with

                                                                                        .

Scottic               neither Toddy nor Tallow.

At another time, when asked what he would drink? he
replied?              aliquid        (a liquid.)

He was once


BOASTING AT A CAMBRIDGE PARTY,

That he could pun upon anything, when he was challenged to do so upon
the Latin Gerunds, and exclaimed, after a pause       


       When Dido found        neas would not come.
She mourned in silence, and was Di-do-dum(b).       



BISHOP HEBER       S COLLEGE PUNS.

The late amiable, learned, and pious Bishop Heber was
not above a pun in his day, notwithstanding Dr. Johnson       s
anathema, that a man who made a pun would pick a pocket.
Among the jeux des mots attributed to him are the
following: he was one day dining with an Oxford party,
comprises the         lite of his day, and when the servant was
[Pg 33]
in the act of removing the table-cloth from off the green
table-covering, at the end of their meal, he exclaimed, in
the words of Horace       

       Diffugere nives: redeunt jam gramina campis.       

At another time he made one of a party of Oxonians,
amongst whom was a gentleman of great rotundity of person,
on which account he had acquired the soubriquet of
       heavy-a       se;        and he was withal of very somniferous habits,
frequently dozing in the midst of a conversation that
would have made the very glasses tingle with delight. He
had fallen fast asleep during the time a mirth-moving subject
was recited by one of the party, but woke up just at
the close, when all save himself were        shaking fat sides,       
and on his begging to know the subject of their laughter,
Heber let fly at him in pure Horatian       

       Exsomnis stupet Evias.       

The mirth-loving Dr. Barnard, late Provost of Eton, was
cotemporary, at Cambridge, with


A WORTHY OF THE SAME SCHOOL,

Who, then a student of St. John       s College, used to frequent
the same parties that Barnard did, who was of
King       s. Barnard used to taunt him with his stupidity;
       and,        said Judge Hardinge, who records the anecdote,
       he one day half killed Barnard with laughter, who had
been taunting him, as usual, with the simplicity of the following
excuse and remonstrance: You are always running
your rigs upon me and calling me        stupid fellow;        and it
is very cruel, now, that       s what it is; for you don       t consider
that a broad-wheeled wagon went over my head when
I was ten years old.        And here I must remark upon the
injustice of persons reflecting upon the English Universities,
as their enemies often do, because every man who
succeeds in getting a degree does not turn out a Porson or
a Newton. I knew one Cantab, a Caius man, to whom
writing a letter to his friends was such an effort, that he
used to get his medical attendant to give him an        grotat
(put him on the sick list,) and, besides,


[Pg 34]
KEEP HIS DOOR SPORTED FOR A WEEK,

till the momentous task was accomplished. And two Oxonians
were of late


PLUCKED AT THEIR DIVINITY EXAMINATION,

Because one being asked,        Who was the Mediator, between
God and man?        answered,        The Archbishop of Canterbury.       
The other being questioned as to        why our
Saviour sat on the right hand of God?        replied,        Because
the Holy Ghost sat on the left.       


COMPLIMENT TO THE MEN OF EXETER COLLEGE, OXON.

       The men of Exeter College, Oxon,        says Fuller, in his
Church History,        consisted chiefly of Cornish and Devonshire
men, the gentry of which latter, Queen Elizabeth used
to say, are courtiers by birth. And as these western men
do bear away the bell for might and sleight in wrestling,
so the scholars here have always acquitted themselves with
credit in Pal       stra literaria.       

And writing of this society reminds me that


HIS GRACE OF WELLINGTON

Is a living example of the fact, that it does not require great
learning to make a great general; nor is great learning always
necessary to complete the character of the head of a
college. The late Rector of Exeter College, Dr. Cole, raised
that society, by his prudent management, from the very reduced
rank in which he found it amongst the other foundations
of Oxford, to a flourishing and high reputation for good
scholarship. Yet he is said one day to have complimented
a student at collections, by saying, after the gentleman had
construed his portion of Sophocles,        Sir, you have construed
your Livy very well.        He nevertheless redeemed his
credit by one day posing a student, during his divinity examination,
with asking him, in vain,        What Christmas day
was?        Another Don of the same college, once asking a
student of the society some divinity question, which he was
[Pg 35]
equally at a loss for an answer, he exclaimed              Good God,
sir, you the son of a clergyman, and not answer such a
question as that?        Aristotle was of opinion that knowledge
could only be acquired, but our tutor seems to have
thought, like the opponents of Aristotle, that a son of a parson
ought to be born to it.


ANOTHER OXONIAN WAS POSED,

Whom I knew, yet was by no means deficient in scholastic
learning, and withal a great wag. He was asked, at
the divinity examination, how many sacraments there were.
This happened at the time that the Catholic question was
in the high road to the House of Lords, under the auspices
of the Duke of Wellington, and he had been cramming his
upper story with abundance of Catholic Faith from the
writings of Faber, Gandolphy, and the Bishops of Durham
and Exeter.        How many sacraments are there, sir?        repeated
the Examiner (of course referring to the Church of
England.) The student paused on, and the question was
repeated a second time;        Why       a       suppose       we       a       say
half a dozen,        was the reply. It is needless to add he was
plucked. The following


LAPSUS GRAMMATIC       

Is attributed to a certain D.D. of Exeter, who, having undertaken
to lionize one of the foreign princes of the many
that accompanied the late king and the sovereigns of Russia
and Prussia to Oxford, in 1814, a difficulty arose between
them as to their medium of communication; the
prince being ignorant of the English language, and the doctor
no less so with respect to modern foreign languages. In
this dilemma the latter proposed an interchange of ideas
by means of the fingers, in the following unique address:              Intelligisne
colloquium cum digitalibus tuis?       

It would be somewhat awkward for certain alumni if his Grace of
Wellington should issue an imperative decree, as Chancellor,


THAT THE LATIN TONGUE BE USED,

(As Wood says, in his annals, the famous Archbishop Bancroft
[Pg 36]
did, on being raised to the dignity of Chancellor of
Oxford in 1608,)        By the students in their halls and colleges,
whereby,        said his Grace,        the young as well as
the old may be inured to a ready and familiar delivery of
their minds in that language, whereof there was now so
much use both in studies and common conversation; for
it was now observed (and so it may in these present times,
adds Wood,) that it was a great blemish to the learned
men of this nation, that they being complete in all good
knowledge, yet they were not able promptly and aptly to
express themselves in Latin, but with hesitation and circumlocution,
which ariseth only from disuse.       


EFFECT OF HABIT.

Dr. Fothergill, when Provost of Queen       s College, Oxford,
was a singular as well as a learned man, and would
not have been seen abroad minus his wig and gown for a
dukedom. One night a fire broke out in the lodge, which
spread with such rapidity, that it was with difficulty Mrs.
F. and family escaped the fury of the flames; and this she
no sooner did than, naturally enough, the question was,
       Where is the Doctor?        No Doctor was to be found; and
the cry was he had probably perished in the flames. All
was bustle, and consternation, and tears, till suddenly, to
the delight of all, he emerged from the burning pile, full-dressed,
as usual, his wig something the worse for being
nearly        done to a turn;        but he deemed it indecorous for
him to appear otherwise, though he stayed to robe at the
risk of his life.



THE CONCUSSION.

The living Cambridge worthy, William Sydney Walker,
M.A. (who at the age of sixteen wrote the successful
tragedy of Wallace, and recently vacated his fellowship
at Trinity College        for conscience-sake,       ) walking hastily
round the corner of a street in Cambridge, in his peculiarly
near-sighted sidling hasty manner, he suddenly came
in contact with the blind muffin-man who daily perambulates
[Pg 37]
the town. The concussion threw both upon their
haunches.        Don       t you see I       m blind?        exclaimed the
muffin-man, in great wrath.        How should I,        rejoined
the learned wag,        when I       m blind too.       




COMIC PICTURE OF THE ELECTION OF A PROVOST OF KING       S COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE.

Upon the death of a provost of King       s College, Cambridge,
the fellows are obliged, according to their statutes,
to be shut up in their celebrated chapel till they have
agreed upon the election of a successor, a custom not unlike
that to which the cardinals are subject at Rome, upon
the death of a pope, where not uncommonly some half dozen
are brought out dead before an election takes place.
       The following is a comic picture of an election,        says
Judge Hardinge, in Nichols       s Illustrations of Literature,
from the pen of Daniel Wray, Esq. dated from Cambridge,
the 19th of January, 1743.        The election of a
provost of King       s is over       Dr. George is the man. The
fellows went into chapel on Monday, before noon in the
morning, as the statute directs. After prayers and sacrament,
they began to vote:       22 for George; 16 for Thackery;
10 for Chapman. Thus they continued, scrutinizing
and walking about, eating and sleeping; some of them
smoking. Still the same numbers for each candidate, till
yesterday about noon (for they held that in the forty-eight
hours allowed for the election no adjournment could be
made,) when the Tories, Chapman       s friends, refusing absolutely
to concur with either of the other parties, Thackery       s
votes went over to George by agreement, and he was
declared. A friend of mine, a curious fellow, tells me he
took a survey of his brothers at two o       clock in the morning,
and that never was a more curious or a more diverting
spectacle: some wrapped in blankets, erect in their
stalls like mummies; others asleep on cushions, like so
many Gothic tombs. Here a red cap over a wig, there a
face lost in the cape of a rug; one blowing a chafing-dish
with a surplice-sleeve; another warming a little negus, or
[Pg 38]
sipping Coke upon Littleton, i. e. tent and brandy. Thus
did they combat the cold of that frosty night, which has
not killed any one of them, to my infinite surprise.        One
of the fellows of King       s engaged in this election was Mr.
C. Pratt, afterwards Lord High Chancellor of England,
and father of the present Marquis of Camden, who, writing
to his amiable and learned friend and brother Etonian and
Kingsman, Dr. Sneyd Davies, archdeacon of Derby,      c.
in the January of the above year, says,        Dear Sneyd we
are all busy in the choice of a provost. George and Thackery
are the candidates. George has all the power and
weight of the Court interest, but I am for Thackery, so
that I am at present a patriot, and vehemently declaim
against all unstatutable influence. The College are so
divided, that your friends the Tories may turn the balance
if they will; but, if they should either absent themselves
or nominate a third man, Chapman, for example, Thackery
will be discomfited. Why are not you a doctor? We
could choose you against all opposition. However, I insist
upon it, that you shall qualify yourself against the
next vacancy, for since you will not come to London, and
wear lawn sleeves, you may stay where you are, and be
provost,              which he did not live to be, though he did take
his D.D.



SIR, DOMINUS, MAGISTRI, SIR GREENE.

A writer in an early volume of the Gentleman       s Magazine
has stated, that        the Christian name is never used in
the university with the addition of Sir, but the surname
only.        Cole says, in reply,        This is certainly so at Cambridge.
Yet when Bachelors of Arts get into the country,
it is quite the reverse; for then, whether curates, chaplains,
vicars, or rectors, they are constantly styled Sir, or
Dominus, prefixed to both their names, to distinguish them
from Masters of Arts, or Magistri. This may be seen,       
he says,        in innumerable instances in the lists of incumbents
in New Court,      c.        And, he adds, addressing himself
to that illustrious character, Sylvanus Urban,        I could
[Pg 39]
produce a thousand others from the wills, institutions,      c.
in the diocese of Ely, throughout the whole reign of Henry
VIII. and for many years after, till the title was abandoned,
and are never called Sir Evans, or Sir Martext, as in
the university they would be, according to your correspondent       s
opinion, but invariably Sir Hugh Evans and Sir
Oliver Martext,      c. The subject,        adds this pleasant
chronicler,               seria ludo,        puts me in mind of a very pleasant
story, much talked of when I was first admitted of
the university, which I know to be fact, as I since heard
Mr. Greene, the dean of Salisbury, mention it. The dean
was at that time only Bachelor of Arts, and Fellow of
Bene       t College, where Bishop Mawson was master, and
then, I think, Bishop of Llandaff, who, being one day at
Court, seeing Mr. Greene come into the drawing-room,
immediately accosted him, pretty loud, in this manner,
How do you do, Sir Greene? When did you leave College,
Sir Greene? Mr. Greene was quite astonished, and the
company present much more so, as not comprehending the
meaning of the salutation or title, till Mr. Greene explained
it, and also informed them,        observes Cole, with his
accustomed fulness of information,        of the worthy good
bishop       s absences.       



HUSBANDS MAY BEAT THEIR WIVES.

Fuller relates in his Abel Redivivus, that the celebrated
President of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, Dr. John
Rainolds, the contemporary of Jewel and Usher, had a controversy
with one William Gager, a student of Christ-Church,
who contended for the lawfulness of stage-plays;
and the same Gager, he adds, maintained, horresco referens!
in a public act in the university, that        it was lawful
for husbands to beat their wives.       



ANOTHER ATTACK ON THE LADIES

Is contained in Antony Wood       s        angry account        of the
[Pg 40]
alterations made in Merton College, of which he was a fellow, during
the wardenship of Sir Thomas Clayton, whose lady, says Wood,        did put
the college to unnecessary charges and very frivolous expenses, among
which were a very large looking-glass, for her to see her ugly face,
and body to the middle, * * * * * which was brought in Hilary terme,
1674, and cost, as the bursar told me, above 10       .; a bedstead
and bedding, worth 40       ., must also be bought, because the
former bedstead and bedding was too short for him (he being a tall
man,) so perhaps when a short warden comes, a short bed must be
bought.        There were also other


EXTRAORDINARY DOINGS AT MERTON.

When the Vandals of Parliamentary visiters, in Cromwell       s
time, perpetrated their spoliations at Oxford, one
of them, Sir Nathaniel Brent, says Wood, actually        took
down the rich hangings at the altar of the chapel, and ornamented
his bedchamber with them.       



DIGGING YOUR GRAVES WITH YOUR TEETH.

The late vice-master of Trinity College, Cambridge, the
Rev. William Hodson, B.D., and the late Regius Professor
of Hebrew, the Rev. William Collier, B.D., who had also
been tutor of Trinity College, were both skilled in the
science of music, and constant visiters at the quartett parties
of Mr. Sharp, of Green Street, Cambridge, organist of
St. John       s College. The former happened one evening to
enter Mr. Sharp       s sanctum sanctorum, rather later than
usual, and found the two latter just in the act of discussing
a brace of roast ducks, with a bowl of punch in the background.
He was pressed to join them.        No, no, gentlemen,       
was his reply,        give me a glass of water and a
crust. You know not what you are doing. You are digging
your graves with your teeth.        Both gentlemen, however,
out-lived him.


[Pg 41]

DR. TORKINGTON       S GRATITUDE TO HIS HORSE.

The late master of Clare Hall, Cambridge, Dr. Torkington,
was one evening stopped by a footpad or pads, in
the neighbourhood of Cambridge, when riding at an humble
pace on his old Rosinante, which had borne him through
many a long year. Both horse and master were startled
by the awful tones in which the words,        Stand, and deliver!       
were uttered, to say nothing of the flourish of a shillelah,
or something worse, and an unsuccessful attempt to
grab the rein. The horse, declining acquiescence, set off
at a good round pace, and thus saved his master; an act
for which the old doctor was so grateful, that he never suffered
it to be rode again, but had it placed in a paddock,

SAY JOHN SHARP IS A ROGUE.

At the time the celebrated Archbishop Sharp was at Oxford,
it was the custom in that University, as likewise in
Cambridge, for students to have a chum or companion,
who not only shared the sitting-room with each other, but
the bed also; and a writer, speaking of the University of
Cambridge, says, one of the colleges was at one period so
full, that when writing a letter, the students were obliged
to hold their hand over it, to prevent its contents being
seen. Archbishop Sharp, when an Oxford Scholar, was
awoke in the night by his chum lying by his side, who told
him he had just dreamed a most extraordinary dream;
which was, that he (Sharp) would be an Archbishop of
York. After some time, he again awoke him, and said he
had dreamt the same, and was well assured he would arrive
at that dignity. Sharp, extremely angry at being thus
disturbed, told him if he awoke him any more, he would
send him out of bed. However, his chum, again dreaming
the same, ventured to awake him; on which Sharp became
[Pg 42]
much enraged; but his bed-fellow telling him, if he had
again the same dream he would not annoy him any more,
if he would faithfully promise him, should he ever become
archbishop, to give him a good rectory, which he named.
       Well, well,        said Sharp,        you silly fellow, go to sleep;
and if your dream, which is very unlikely, should come
true, I promise you the living.               By that time,        said
his chum,        you will have forgot me and your promise.       
       No, no,        says Sharp,        that I shall not; but, if I do not
remember you, and refuse you the living, then say John
Sharp is a rogue.        After Dr. Sharp had been archbishop
some time, his old friend (his chum) applied to him (on
the said rectory being vacant,) and, after much difficulty,
got admitted to his presence, having been informed by the
servant, that the archbishop was particularly engaged with
a gentleman relative to the same rectory for which he was
going to apply. The archbishop was told there was a clergyman
who was extremely importunate to see him, and
would take no denial. His Grace, extremely angry, ordered
him to be admitted, and requested to know why he
had so rudely almost forced himself into his presence.
       I come,        says he,        my Lord, to claim an old promise,
the rectory of               .               I do not remember, sir, ever to
have seen you before; how, then, could I have promised
you the rectory, which I have just presented to this gentleman?       
       Then,        says his old chum,        John Sharp is a
rogue!        The circumstance was instantly roused in the
mind of the archbishop, and the result was, he provided
liberally for his dreaming chum in the Church.



       I SAID AS HOW YOU       D SEE.       

       In the year 1821,        says Parke, in his Musical Memoirs,
       I occasionally dined with a pupil of mine, Mr.
Knight, who had lately left college. This young man
(who played the most difficult pieces on the flute admirably)
and his brother Cantabs, when they met, were very
fond of relating the wild tricks for which the students of
the University of Cambridge are celebrated. The following
[Pg 43]
relation of one will convey some idea,        he says,        of
their general eccentricity:       A farmer, who resided at a
considerable distance from Cambridge, but who had, nevertheless,
heard of the excesses committed by the students,
having particular business in the before-mentioned
seat of the Muses, together with a strong aversion to entering
it, took his seat on the roof of the coach, and, being
engrossed with an idea of danger, said to the coachman,
who was a man of few words,        I       ze been towld that the
young gentlemen at Cambridge be wild chaps.               You       ll
see,        replied the coachman;        and,        added the farmer,        that
it be hardly safe to be among        em.               You       ll see,        again
replied the coachman. During the journey the farmer put
several other interrogatories to the coachman, which was
answered, as before, with        You       ll see!        When they had
arrived in the High Street of Cambridge, Mr. Knight had
a party of young men at his lodgings, who were sitting in
the first floor, with the windows all open, and a large China
bowl full of punch before them, which they had just
broached. The noise made by their singing and laughing,
attracting the notice and exciting the fears of the farmer,
he again, addressing his taciturn friend, the coachman,
(whilst passing close under the window,) said with great
anxiety,        Are we all safe, think ye?        when, before the master
of the whip had time to utter his favourite monosyllables,
       You       ll see,        bang came down, on the top of the
coach, bowl, punch, glasses,      c. to the amazement and
terror of the farmer, who was steeped in his own favourite
potation.        There,        said coachee (who had escaped a wetting,)
       I said as how you       d see!              



I NOW LEAVE YOU TO MAKE AS MUCH NOISE AS YOU PLEASE.

When Gray produced his famous Ode for the installation
of his patron, the late Duke of Grafton, a production,
it is observed, which would have been more admired, had
it        not been surpassed by his two masterpieces, the Bard,
and the Progress of Poetry,        being possessed of a very accurate
[Pg 44]
taste for music, which he had formed on the Italian
model, he weighed every note of the composer       s music, (the
learned Cambridge professor, Dr. Randall,) with the most
critical exactness, and kept the composer in attendance
upon him, says Dyer, in his Supplement, for three months.
Gray was, indeed, a thorough disciple of the Italian school
of music, whilst the professor was an ardent admirer of
the sublime compositions of Handel, whose noise, it is
stated, Gray could not bear; but after the professor had
implicitly followed his views till he came to the chorus,
Gray exclaimed,        I have now done, and leave you to make
as much noise as you please.        This fine composition is
still in MS. in the hands of the Doctor       s son, Mr. Edward
Randall, of the town of Cambridge.




THE MAD PETER-HOUSE POET.

Gray was not the only modern poet of deserved celebrity,
which Peter-House had the honour to foster in her
cloisters. A late Fellow of that Society, named Kendal,
       a person of a wild and deranged state of mind,        says
Dyer, but, it must be confessed, with much method in his
madness, during his residence in Cambridge,        occasionally
poured out, extemporaneously, the most beautiful effusions,       
but the paucity of the number preserved have almost
left him without a name, though meriting a niche in
Fame       s temple. I therefore venture to repeat the following,
with his name, that his genius may live with it:       


The town have found out different ways,
To praise its different Lears:
To Barry it gives loud huzzas,
To Garrick only tears.


He afterwards added this exquisite effusion:       


A king,       aye, every inch a king,       
Such Barry doth appear;
But Garrick       s quite another thing,
He       s every inch King Lear.



[Pg 45]

THE GRACE CUP OF PEMBROKE-HALL, CAMBRIDGE.

An ancient cup of silver gilt is preserved by this society,
which was given to them by the noble foundress of
their college, Lady Mary de St. Paul, daughter of Guy
de Castillon, Earl of St. Paul, in France, and widow of
Audomar de Valentia, Earl of Pembroke, who is said to
have been killed in a tournament, held in France, in 1323,
in honour of their wedding day,       an accident, says Fuller,
by which she was        a maid, a wife, and a widow, in one
day.        Lysons in his second volume, has given an engraved
delineation of this venerable goblet; the foot of
which, says Cole, in the forty-second volume of his MSS.
       stands on a large circle, whose upper rim is neatly ornamented
with small fleurs de lis, in open work, and looks
very like an ancient coronet.        On a large rim, about the
middle of the cup, is a very ancient embossed inscription;
which, says the same authority, in 1773,        not a soul in
the College could read, and the tradition of it was forgotten;       
but he supposes it to run:       

Sayn Denis        yt es me dere for his lof drenk and mak gud cher.

The other inscription is short, and has an M. and V. above
the circle;        which,        adds Cole,        I take to mean, God
help at need Mary de Valentia.        At the bottom of the
inside of the cup is an embossed letter M. This he does
not comprehend; but says it may possibly stand for Mementote.
       Dining in Pembroke College Hall, New Year       s
Day, 1773,        he adds,        the grace cup of silver gilt, the
founder       s gift to her college, was produced at the close of
dinner, when, being full of sweet wine, the old custom is
here, as in most other colleges, for the Master, at the head
of the long table, to rise, and, standing on his feet, to drink,
In piam memoriam (Fundatricis,) to his neighbour on his
right hand, and, who is also to be standing. When the Master
has drunk, he delivers the cup to him he drank to, and sits
down; and the other, having the cup, drinks to his opposite
neighbour, who stands up while the other is drinking;
and thus alternately till it has gone quite through the company,
two always standing at a time. It is of no large capacity,
and is often replenished.       


This is not unlike[Pg 46]
THE TERTIAVIT

of the Mertonians, as they call it (says Mr. Pointer,) from
a barbarous Latin word derived from Tertius, because
there are always three standing at a time. The custom,
he says, is a loyal one, and arises from their drinking the
King and Queen       s health standing (at dinner) on some extraordinary
days (called Gaudies, from the Latin word
Gaudeo, to rejoice,) to show their loyalty. There are always
three standing at a time the first not sitting down
again till the second has drank to a third man. The same
loyal custom, under different forms, prevails in all colleges
in both Universities. At the Inns of Court, also, in London,
the King       s health is drunk every term, on what is
called Grand Day, all members present, big-wig and student,
having filled        a bumper of sparkling wine,        rise
simultaneously, and drink        The King,        supernaculum,
of course.



A MORE CAPACIOUS BOWL

Than the foregoing is in the possession of the Society of
Jesus College, Oxford, says Chalmers, the gift of the hospitable
Sir Watkins Williams Wynne, grandfather to the
present baronet. It will contain ten gallons, and weighs
278 ounces: how or when it is used, this deponent sayeth
not. Queen       s College, Oxon, says Mr. Pointer, has its       


HORN OF DIVERSION,

So called because it never fails to afford funnery. It is
kept in the buttery, is occasionally presented to persons to
drink out of and is so contrived, that by lifting it up to
the mouth too hastily, the air gets in and suddenly forces
too great a quantity of the liquid, as if thrown into the
drinker       s face, to his great surprise and the delight of the
standers by. Multa cadunt inter calicem supremaque labra.


[Pg 47]
ANOTHER BIBULOUS RELIQUE

Was the famous chalice, found in one of the hands of the
founder of Merton College, Oxford, the celebrated Walter
de Merton, Bishop of Rochester and Chancellor of England,
upon the opening of his grave in 1659, says Wood,
on the authority of Mr. Leonard Yate, Fellow of Merton.
It held more than a quarter of a pint; and the Warden and
Fellows caused it to be sent to the College, to be put into
their cista jocalium; but the Fellows, in their zeal, sometimes
drinking out of it,        this, then, so valued relic was
broken and destroyed.       



A LAUDABLE AND CHRISTIAN CUSTOM,

In Merton College, says Pointer, in his Oxoniensis Academia,
     c.        is their meeting together in the Hall on Christmas
Eve, and other solemn times, to sing a Psalm, and
drink a Grace Cup to one another, (called Poculum Charitatis)
wishing one another health and happiness. These
Grace Cups,        he adds,        they drink to one another every
day after dinner and supper, wishing one another peace and
good neighbourhood.        This conclusion reminds us of the
following anecdote:       

A learned Cambridge mathematician, now holding a distinguished
post at the Naval College, Portsmouth, after
discussing one day, with a party of Johnians, the propriety
of the Dies Fest       , solar, siderial,      c., drily observed,
putting a bumper to his lips,        I think we should have
jovial days as well.        Every College in both Universities
has the next best thing to it,       


THEIR FEAST DAYS,

       In piam memoriam        of their several founders, most of
whom being persons of taste, left certain annual sums
wherewith to        pay the piper.        Besides minor feast-days,
every Society, both at Oxford and Cambridge, hold its
yearly commemoration. There is always prayers and a
sermon on this day, and the Lesson is taken from Eccl.
[Pg 48]
xliv.        Let us now praise famous men,             c. Mr. Pointer
says, that at Magdalen College, Oxford, it is        a custom on
all commemoration days to have the bells rung in a confused
manner, and without any order, it being the primitive
way of ringing.        The same writer states that there is


A MUSICAL MAY-DAY COMMEMORATION,

Annually celebrated by this Society, which consists of a
concert of music on the top of the Tower, in honour of its
founder, Henry VII. It was originally a mass, but since
the Reformation, it has been        a merry concert of both
vocal and instrumental music, consisting of several merry
ketches, and lasts almost two hours (beginning as early as
four o       clock in the morning,) and is concluded with ringing
the bells.        The performers have a breakfast for their
pains. They have likewise singing early on Christmas
morning. The custom is similar to one observed at Manheim,
in Germany, and throughout the palatinate.

Whoever was the author of the following admirable production,
he was certainly not                         -less, and it will        hardly
be read with dry lips, or mouths that do not water,        says
the author of the Gradus ad Cant.


ODE ON A COLLEGE FEAST DAY.

I.


Hark! heard ye not yon footsteps dread,
That shook the hall with thund       ring tread?
With eager haste
The Fellows pass       d,
Each, intent on direful work,
High lifts his mighty blade, and points his deadly fork.


II.


But, hark! the portals sound, and pacing forth,
With steps, alas! too slow,
The College Gypts, of high illustrious worth,
With all the dishes, in long order go.
In the midst a form divine,
Appears the fam       d sir-loin;
And soon, with plums and glory crown       d
Almighty pudding sheds its sweets around.
[Pg 49]Heard ye the din of dinner bray?
Knife to fork, and fork to knife,
Unnumber       d heroes, in the glorious strife,
Through fish, flesh, pies, and puddings, cut their destin       d way.


III.


See beneath the mighty blade,
Gor       d with many a ghastly wound,
Low the famed sir-loin is laid,
And sinks in many a gulf profound.
Arise, arise, ye sons of glory,
Pies and puddings stand before ye;
See the ghost of hungry bellies,
Points at yonder stand of jellies;
While such dainties are beside ye,
Snatch the goods the gods provide ye;
Mighty rulers of this state,
Snatch before it is too late;
For, swift as thought, the puddings, jellies, pies,
Contract their giant bulks, and shrink to pigmy size.


IV.


From the table now retreating,
All around the fire they meet,
And, with wine, the sons of eating,
Crown at length the mighty treat:
Triumphant plenty       s rosy traces
Sparkle in their jolly faces;
And mirth and cheerfulness are seen
In each countenance serene.
Fill high the sparkling glass,
And drink the accustomed toast;
Drink deep, ye mighty host,
And let the bottle pass.
Begin, begin the jovial strain;
Fill, fill the mystic bowl;
And drink, and drink, and drink again;
For drinking fires the soul.
But soon, too soon, with one accord they reel;
Each on his seat begins to nod;
All conquering Bacchus        pow       r they feel,
And pour libations to the jolly god.
At length, with dinner, and with wine oppress       d,
Down in their chairs they sink, and give themselves to rest.




SIR ROBERT WALPOLE AT CAMBRIDGE.

Sir Robert Walpole, the celebrated minister, was bred
at Eton and King       s College, Cambridge. At the first he
[Pg 50]
raised great expectations as a boy, and when the master
was told that St. John, afterwards Lord Bolingbroke, had
with others, his scholars, distinguished themselves for their
eloquence, in the House of Commons,        I am impatient to
hear that Walpole has spoken,        was his observation;        for
I feel convinced he will be a good orator.        At King       s
College his career was near being cut short by an attack
of the small-pox. He was then known as a fierce Whig,
and his physicians were Tories, one of whom, Dr. Brady,
said,        We must take care to save this young man, or we
shall be accused of having purposely neglected him, because
he is so violent a Whig.        After he was restored,
his spirit and disposition so pleased the same physician,
that he added,        this singular escape seems to be a sure prediction
that he is reserved for important purposes,        which
Walpole remembered with complacency.



Dr. Lamb, the present master of Corpus Christi, Cambridge,
in his edition of Master       s History of that College,
gives the following copy of a bill, in the handwriting of
Dr. John Jegon, a former master, which may be taken as a
specimen of

recorded in Mr. Pointer       s curious book, is the now obsolete
and very ancient one at Merton College, called


THE BLACK-NIGHT.

Formerly the Dean of the college kept the Bachelor-fellows
[Pg 52]
at disputations in the hall, sometimes till late at
night, and then to give, them a black-night (as they called
it;) the reason of which was this:              Among many other
famous scholars of this college, there were two great logicians,
the one Johannes Duns Scotus, called Doctor Subtilis,
Fellow of the college, and father of the sect of the
Realists, and his scholar Gulielmus Occam, called Doctor
Invincibilis, of the same house, and father of the sect of the
Nomenalists; betwixt whom there falling out a hot dispute
one disputation night, Scotus being the Dean of the college,
and Occam (a Bachelor-fellow therein,) though the
latter got the better on       t, yet being but an inferior, at parting
submitted himself, with the rest of the Bachelors, to
the Dean in this form, Domine, quid faciernus? (i. e. Sir,
what is your pleasure?) as it were begging punishment for
their boldness in arguing; to whom Scotus returned this
answer, Ite et facite quid vultis (i. e. Begone, and do as you
please.) Hereupon away they went and broke open the
buttery and kitchen doors, and plundered all the provisions
they could lay hands on; called all their companions
out of their beds, and made a merry bout on       t all night.
This gave occasion for observing the same diversion several
times afterwards, whenever the Dean kept the Bachelor-fellows
at disputation till twelve o       clock at night. The
last black-night was about 1686.       



THE FORCE OF IMAGINATION.

A learned Cantab, who was so deaf as to be obliged to
use an ear trumpet, having taken his departure from Trinity
College, of which he was lately a fellow, mounted on his
well-fed Rosinante for the purpose of visiting a friend, fell
in with an acquaintance by the way side, with whom he
was induced to dine, and evening was setting in ere he
pushed forward for his original destination. Warm with
T. B., he had not gone far ere he let fall the reins on the
neck of his pegasus, which took its own course till he was
suddenly roused by its coming to a stand-still where four
cross roads met, in a part of the country to which he was an
[Pg 53]
utter stranger. What added to the dilemma, the direction-post
had been demolished. He luckily espied an old
farmer jogging homeward from market.        Hallo! my man,
can you tell me the way to               ?               Yes, to be sure I can.
You must go down hin-hinder lane, and cross yin-yinder
common on the left, then you       ll see a hol and a pightal and
the old mills, and                              Stop, stop, my good friend!       
exclaimed our Cantab;        you don       t know I       m deaf,        pulling
his ear-trumpet out of his pocket as he spoke: this the
farmer no sooner got a glimpse of, than, taking it for a pistol
or blunderbuss, and its owner for a highwayman, he
clapped spurs to his horse, and galloped off at full speed,
roaring out for mercy as our Cantab bawled for him to
stop, the muzzle of his horse nosing the tail of the farmer       s,
till they came to an opening in a wood by the road side,
through which the latter vanished, leaving the Cantab
solus, after a chase of some miles,       and upon inquiry at a
cottage, he learnt he was still ten or twelve from the place
of his destination, little short of the original distance he had
to ride when he first started from Cambridge in the morning.
This anecdote reminds me of two Oxonians of considerable
celebrity, learning, and singular manners. One
was the late amiable organist of Dulwich College the Rev.
Onias Linley, son of Mr. Linley, of Drury-lane and musical
celebrity: he was consequently brother of Mrs. R. B. Sheridan.
He was bred at Winchester and New College, and
was remarkable, when a minor canon at Norwich, in Norfolk,
for


HIS ABSENT HABITS,

And the ridiculous light in which they placed him, and for
carrying a huge snuff-box in one hand, which he constantly
kept twirling with the other between his finger and
thumb. He once attended a ball at the public assembly
rooms, when, having occasion to visit the temple of Cloacina,
he unconsciously walked back into the midst of the
crowd of beauties present, with a certain coverlid under
his arm, in lieu of his opera hat; nor was he aware of the
exchange he had made till a friend gave him a gentle hint.
He occasionally rode a short distance into the country to
[Pg 54]
do duty on a Sunday, when he used compassionately to relieve
his steed by alighting and walking on, with the horse
following, and the bridle on his arm. Upon such occasions
he frequently fell into what is called        a brown study,       
and arrived at his destination dragging the bridle after
him, minus the horse, which had stopped by the way to
crop grass. He was one day met on the road so circumstanced,
and reminded of the fact by a gentleman who
knew him.        Bless me,        said he, with the most perfect
composure,        the horse was with me when I sat out. I
must go back to seek him.        And back he went a mile or
two, when he found his steed grazing by the way, bridled
him afresh, and reached his church an hour later than usual,
much to the chagrin of his congregation. The late Dr.
Adams, one of the first who went out to Demerara after the
established clergy were appointed to stations and parishes in
the West Indies by authority, was a man of habits very
similar to those of Mr. Linley, and very similar anecdotes
are recorded of him, and his oddities are said to have caused
some mirth to his sable followers. He died in about a
year or two, much regretted notwithstanding.




THE EARLY POETS BRED IN THE HALLS OF GRANTA,

       Semper       pauperimus esse,        were nearly all blest with
none or a slender competence. But what they wanted in
wealth was amply supplied in wit. Spenser, Lee, Otway,
Ben Johnson, and his son Randolph, Milton, Cowley, Dryden,
Prior, and Kit Smart, poets as they were, had fared
but so so, had they lived by po      sy only       and who ever
dreamed of caring ought for their posterity.

Spencer was matriculated a member of Pembroke College,
Cambridge, the 20th of May, 1569, at the age of sixteen,
at which early period he is supposed to have been under
his        sweet fit of poesy,        and soon after formed the design of
his great poem, the Faery Queene, stanzas of which, it is
said, on very good authority, were lately discovered on the
removal of some of the old wainscoting of the room in which
he kept in Pembroke College. He took B. A. 1573, and
[Pg 55]
M. A. 1576, without succeeding to fellowship, died in
want of bread, 1599, and was buried in Westminster Abbey,
according to his request, near Chaucer. Camden
says of him       


       Anglica, te vivo, vixit plautisque poesis,
Nunc moritura, timet, te moriente, mori!       


In the common-place-book of Edward, Earl of Oxford
and Mortimer, preserved amongst the MSS. of the British
Museum, is the memoranda:              Lord Carteret told me,
that when he was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, a man of
the name of Spenser, immediately descended from our illustrious
poet, came to be examined before the Lord Chief
Justice, as a witness in a cause, and that he was so entirely
ignorant of the English language, that they were forced to
have an interpreter for him.        But I have no intention to
give my readers the blues.        Nat. Lee        was a Trinity
man, and was, as the folk say,        as poor as a church mouse       
during his short life, four years of which he passed in
Bedlam. An envious scribe one day there saw him, and
mocked his calamity by asking,        If it was not easy to write
like a madman?               No, Sir,        said he;        but it is


VERY EASY TO WRITE LIKE A FOOL.       

Otway was bred at St. John       s College, Cambridge.
But though his tragedies are still received with        tears of
approbation,        he lived in penury, and died in extreme
misery, choked, it is said, by a morsel of bread given him
to relieve his hunger, the 14th of April, 1685. Ben Jonson,
       Rare Ben,        also        finished his education        at St. John       s,
nor did I ever tread the mazes of its pleasant walks, but
imagination pictured him and his gifted contemporaries and
successors, from the time of the minstrel of Arcadia to the
days of Kirke White,


In dalliance with the nine in ev       ry nook,
A conning nature from her own sweet book.


But Ben, though        the greatest dramatic poet of his age,       
after he left Cambridge,        worked with a trowel at the
building of Lincoln       s Inn,        and died poor in everything
[Pg 56]
but fame, in 1637. Ben, however, contrived to keep nearly
as many        jovial days        in a year, as there are saints in the
Roman calendar, and at a set time held a club at the same
Devil Tavern, near Temple-bar, to which the celebrated
Cambridge professor, and reformer of our church music,
Dr. Maurice Greene, adjourned his concert upon his quarrel
with Handel, which made the latter say of him with his
natural dry humour,        Toctor Creene was gone to de tavil.       
There Ben and his boon companions were still extant, when
Tom Randolph (author of        The Muses        Looking-Glass,       
     c.,) a student of Trinity College, Cambridge, had ventured
on a visit to London, where, it is said, he stayed so
long, that he had already had a parley with his empty purse,
when their fame made him long to see Ben and his associates.
He accordingly, as Handel would have said, vent
to de tavil, at their accustomed time of meeting; but being
unknown to them, and without money, he was peeping into
the room where they sat, when he was espied by Ben,
who seeing him in a scholar       s thread-bare habit, cried out
       John Bo-peep, come in.        He entered accordingly, and
they, not knowing the wit of their guest, began to rhyme
upon the meanness of his clothes, asking him if he could
not make a verse, and, withal, to call for his quart of sack. There
being but four, he thus addressed them:       


       I, John Bo-peep, to you four sheep,
With each one his good fleece,
If that you are willing to give me five shilling,
       Tis fifteen pence a-piece.       


       By Jesus,        exclaimed Ben (his usual oath,)        I believe this
is my son Randolph!        which being confessed, he was
kindly entertained, and Ben ever after called him his son,
and, on account of his learning, gaiety, and humour, and
readiness of repartee, esteemed him equal to Cartwright.
He also grew in favour with the wits and poets of the
metropolis, but was cut off, some say of intemperance, at
the age of twenty-nine. His brother was a member of
Christ Church, Oxford, and printed his works in 1638.
Amongst the Memorabilia Cantabrigi        of Milton is the
fact, that his personal beauty obtained for him the soubriquet
of


[Pg 57]
       THE LADY OF THE COLLEGE;       

And that he set a full value on his fine exterior, is evident
from the imperfect Greek lines, entitled,        In Effigie ejus
Sculptorem,        in Warton       s second edition of his Poems.
Some have supposed he had himself in view, in his delineation
of the person of Adam. Every body knows that his
       Paradise Lost        brought him and his posterity less than
20l.: but every body does not know that there is a Latin
translation of it, in twelve books, in the Library of Trinity
College, Cambridge, in MS., the work of one Mr. Power,
a Fellow of that Society, who printed the First Book in
1691, and completed the rest at the Bermudas, where his
difficulties had obliged him to fly, and from whence it was
sent to Dr. Richard Bentley, to publish and pay his debts
with. However, in spite of his creditors, it still remains
in MS. The writer obtained, says Judge Hardinge, alluding
I suppose, to        the tempest of his mind and of his habits,       
the soubriquet of the               olian Exile.        There is also a
bust of Milton in the Library of Trinity College, and some
of his juvenile poems,      c., in his own hand-writing. Cowley
was bread at Trinity College. His bust, too, graces
its Library, and his portrait its Hall.


BOTH THESE ALUMNI,

When students, wrote Latin as well as English verses, and
the curious in such matters, on reference to this work, will
be amused by the difference of feeling with which their
Alma Mater inspired them. To Cowley the Bowers of
Granta and the Camus were the very seat of inspiration;
Milton thought no epithet too mean to express their charms:
yet, says Dyer, in his supplement,        it is difficult to conceive
a more brilliant example of youthful talent than Milton       s
Latin Poems of that period.        Though they        are not
faultless, they render what was said of Gray applicable to
Milton       


       HE NEVER WAS A BOY.              

His mulberry tree, more fortunate than either that of
Shakspeare, or the pear tree of his contemporary and patron,
[Pg 58]
Oliver Cromwell, is still shown in the Fellows        Garden of
Christ College, and still        bears abundance in fruit-time,       
and near it is a drooping ash, planted by the present Marquis
of Bute, when a student of Christ College.



CROMWELL       S PEAR-TREE

I saw cut down, from the window of my sitting-room, in
Jesus-lane, Cambridge (which happened to overlook the
Fellows        Garden of Sidney College,) in March, 1833.
The tree is said to have been planted by Cromwell       s own
hand, when a student at Sidney College, and, said the
Cambridge Chronicle of the 11th of the above month, it
seems not unlikely that the original stock was coeval
with the Protector. The tree consisted of five stems (at
the time it was cut down,) which rose directly from the
ground, and which had probably shot up after the main
trunk had been accidentally or intentionally destroyed.
Four of these stems had been dead for some years, and the
fifth was cut down, as stated above.        A section of it, at
eight feet from the ground, had 103 consecutive rings, indicating
as many years of growth for that part. If we add
a few more for the growth of the portion still lower down,
it brings us to a period within seventy years of the Restoration;
and it is by no means improbable that the original
trunk may have been at least seventy or eighty years old
before it was mutilated. The stumps of the five stems are
still left standing, the longest being eight feet high; and it
is intended to erect a rustic seat within the area they
embrace.       


OTHER MEMORIALS OF CROMWELL

At Sidney College, are his bust, in the Master       s Lodge,
and his portrait in the Library. The first was executed
by the celebrated Bernini, at the request of Ferdinand,
Grand Duke of Tuscany, from a plaster impression of the
face of Cromwell, taken soon after his death. It was obtained
by the late learned Cambridge Regius Professor of
Botany, Thomas Martyn, B. D., during his stay in Italy,
[Pg 59]
and by him presented to the Society of Sidney College, of
which he was a fellow. Lord Cork said it bore        the strongest
character of boldness, steadiness, sense, penetration, and
pride.        The portrait is unique, drawn in crayons, by the
celebrated Cooper, and is said to be that from which he
painted his famous miniatures of the Protector. In the College
Register is a memorandum of Cromwell       s admission to
the society, dated April 23, 1616, to which some one has
added his character, in Latin, in a different hand-writing,
and very severe terms.



DRYDEN CONFINED TO COLLEGE WALLS.

Dryden, whom some have styled        The True Father of
English Poetry,        was fond of a college life, as especially
       favourable to the habits of a student.        He was bread at
Trinity College, Cambridge, where he resided seven years,
during which he is said never, like Milton and others, to
have        wooed the muses.        What were his college habits
is not known. The only notice of him at Trinity (where
his bust and portrait are preserved, the first in the Library,
the second in the Hall,) whilst an undergraduate, is the
following entry in the College Register, made about two
years after his admission:              July 19, 1652. Agreed, then,
that Dryden be put out of Comons, for a fortnight at least,
and that he goe not out of the College during the time
aforesaid, excepting to Sermons, without express leave
from the Master or Vice-master (disobedience to whom
was his fault,) and that, at the end of the fortnight, he read
a confession of his crime in the Hall at the dinner-time, at
the three fellows        table.       

His contemporary, Dennis the Critic, seems to have been less fortunate
at Cambridge. The author of the        Biographia Dramatica        asserts that he
was


EXPELLED FROM CAIUS COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE.

Which is denied by Dr. Kippis, in the        Biographia Britannica,       
and        when Doctors disagree, who shall decide?        In
this case a third doctor steps in for the purpose, in the
[Pg 60]
person of the celebrated Master of Emmanuel College, Dr.
Richard Farmer, who, in a humorous letter, printed in the
European Magazine for 1794, says, on turning to the
Gesta Book of Caius College, under the head,        Sir
Dennis sent away,        appears this entry:        March 4, 1680. At a
meeting of the Master and Fellows, Sir Dennis mulcted 3l.;
his scholarship taken away, and he sent out of the college,
for assaulting and wounding Sir Glenham with a sword.       



PRIOR LAID OUT THE WALKS OF ST. JOHN       S

College, Cambridge, as I have been told, where he was
educated, and lived and died a Fellow. After he became
French Ambassador, and was distinguished by his sovereign,
he was urged to resign his fellowship. His reply was
(probably not having much faith in the longevity of princes       
favours,)        Should I need it, it will always insure me a bit
of mutton and a clean shirt!        But it ought also to be
added, to his honour, that the celebrated Thomas Baker,
the antiquary, having been ejected from his fellowship in
the same college, for refusing to take the oaths to William
and Mary, Prior generously allowed him the proceeds of
his.

The same Cantab was once at the opera, where a conceited
French composer had taken his seat adjoining, and
being anxious that the audience should know he had written
the music, he annoyed our poet by humming every air so
audibly as to spoil the effect of the person       s singing the part,
one of the greatest artistes of the day. Thus annoyed,
Prior ventured to hiss the singer. Every body was astonished
at the daring, he being a great and deserved favourite.
The composer hummed again,       again Prior hissed
the singer, who, enraged at the circumstance, demanded
       Why he was subject to such indignity?               I want that
fellow to leave off humming,        said Prior, pointing to the
composer,        that I may have the pleasure of hearing you
sing, Signor.       


[Pg 61]

STUNG BY A B.

Dr. Thomas Plume, a former Archdeacon of Colchester,
was the munificent founder of the Cambridge Professorship
of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy, which
(as in the case of the late Dr. Edward Daniel Clarke and
the present George Pryme, Esq. M.A. and M.P.) he was the
first to fill; but he was not as fortunate as the former, to fill
his chair with unparalleled success,       in fact, his lectures
were not quite the fashion. He was smarting under this
truth, when he one day met Dr. Pearce in the streets of Cambridge,
the Master of Jesus College, whom he addressed
with,        Doctor, they call my lectures Plum-B-ian, which
is very uncivil. I don       t at all like it, Dr. Pearce.               I
suppose the B. stung you,        rejoined the latter. Here we
may not inappropriately introduce a trifle, hit off between
Dr. Pearce and the woman who had the care of the Temple
Gardens, when he was master there. It is a rule to
keep them close shut during divine service on Sundays;
but the Doctor being indisposed, and having no grounds
attached to his residence save the church-yard, wished to
seize the quiet hour for taking a little air and exercise.
He accordingly rung the garden bell, and Rachel made her
appearance; but she flatly told him she should not let him
in, as it was against the Benchers        orders.        But I am the
Master of the Temple,        said Dr. P.        The more shame
for you,        said Rachel,        you ought to set a better example;       
and the Doctor retired dead beat.



A NEST OF SAXONISTS.

Queen       s College, Oxford, was called        a nest of Saxonists       
towards the close of the sixteenth century, when
those learned antiquarians and Saxonists, Rawlinson and
Thwaites, flourished there. It is recorded of the latter, in
Nichols       s Bowyer, that he said, writing of the state of the
college,        We want Saxon Lexicons. I have fifteen young
students in that language, and but one Somner for them
all.        Our Cambridge gossip,


[Pg 62]
COLE, RELATES A PLEASANT MISTAKE,

(taken notice of by Warton also in the first volume of his
History of English Poetry) of a brother Cantab       s having
undertaken to translate the Scriptures into Welsh, and
rendering vials of wrath (meaning vessels       Rom. v. 8) by
the Welsh word Crythan, signifying crowds or fiddles.
       The Greek word being                                     ,        he adds,        it is
probable he translated from the English only, where finding vials, he
mistook it for viols.        The translator was Dr. Morgan,
who died Bishop of St. Asaph, in 1604.



MINDING THE ROAST.

Lord Nugent, on-dit, once called on an old college acquaintance,
then a country divine of great simplicity of manners, at a time when
his housekeeper was from home on some errand, and he had undertaken to
mind the roast. This obliged him to invite his lordship into the
kitchen, that he might avoid the fate of King Alfred. Our dame       s stay
exceeded the time anticipated, and the divine having to bury a
corpse, he begged Lord N. to take his turn at the spit, which he
accordingly did, till the housekeeper arrived to relieve him. This
anecdote reminds me of the following


SPECIMEN OF A COLLEGE EXERCISE,

By the Younger Bowyer, written at St. John       s College, Cambridge,
November 29, 1719.

       Ne quicquam sapit, qui sibi ipsi non sapit.       


A goodly parson once there was,
To        s maid would chatter Latin;
(For that he was, I think, an ass,
At least the rhyme comes pat in.)

One day the house to prayers were met,
With well united hearts;
Below, a goose was at the spit,
To feast their grosser parts.

The godly maid to prayers she came,
If truth the legends say,
[Pg 63]To hear her master English lame,
Herself to sleep and pray.

The maid, to hear her worthy master,
Left all alone her kitchen;
Hence happened much a worse disaster
Than if she       d let the bitch in.

While each breast burns with pious flame,
All hearts with ardours beat,
The goose       s breast did much the same
With too malicious heat.

The parson smelt the odours rise;
To        s belly thoughts gave loose,
And plainly seemed to sympathise
With his twice-murdered goose.

He knew full well self-preservation
Bids piety retire,
Just as the salus of a nation
Lays obligation higher.

He stopped, and thus held forth his Clerum,
While him the maid did stare at,
Hoc faciendum; sed alterum
Non negligendum erat.


Parce tuum Vatum sceleris damnare.




TULIP-TIME.

Writing of the death of a former Master of Magdalen College,
       whose whole delight was horses, dogs, sporting,      c.,        which,
says Cole, happened on the first of September, the legal day for
partridge-shooting to begin,        it put me in mind of the late Dr.
Walker, Vice-master of Trinity, a great florist (and founder of the
Botanical Garden at Cambridge,) who, when told of a brother florist       s
death, by shooting himself in the spring, immediately exclaimed,
       Good God! is it possible? Now, at the beginning of tulip-time!              



THE COLLEGE BELL.

When Dr. Barrett, Prebend of St. Paul       s, was a student
[Pg 64]
at Peter-house, Cambridge, he happened to make one of a
party of collegians, where it was proposed that each gentleman
should toast his favourite belle; when it came to his
turn, he facetiously gave        the college-bell!       



COLLEGE FUN.

       Previous to my attending Cambridge,        says Henry
Angelo, in his Reminiscences,        one of my scholars (whom
I had taught at Westminster School,) at Trinity College,
engaged an Irish fencing-master, named Fitzpatrick,       
more remarkable for his native humour than science, and
when he had taken too much of the cratur,        was amusing
to the collegians, who had engaged him merely to keep up
their exercise.        One day, during a bout, some wag placed
a bottle of his favourite        mountain dew        (whisky) on the
chimney-piece, which proved so attractive,        that as his sips
increased, so did the numerous hits he received, till the
first so far prevailed, aided by exertion and the heat of the
weather, that he lay, tandem, to all appearance dead.       
To keep the fun up, he was stripped and laid out like a
corpse, with a shroud on, a coffin close to him, and four
candles placed on each side, ready to light on his recovery.
This jeu de plaisanterie might have been serious;        however,
Master Push-carte took care not to push himself again into
the same place.       



THE KING OF DENMARK AT CAMBRIDGE.

When the late King of Denmark was in England, in
1763, when he visited Eton,      c., he is said to have made a
brief sojourn at Cambridge, where he was received with
       all the honours,        and took up his abode (as is usual for
persons of his rank) in the lodge of the Master of Trinity. In
his majesty       s establishments for learned purposes, as well
as throughout all Germany,      c., no provision is made for
lodging and otherwise providing for the comforts of students,
as in the two English universities; and when he surveyed
[Pg 65]
the principal court of Trinity, he is said to have had
so little notion of an English university, that he asked
       whether that court did not comprise the whole of the
university of Cambridge?        This royal anecdote reminds
me that his present gracious Majesty,


WILLIAM THE FOURTH, ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION
TO VISIT CAMBRIDGE.

As in duty bound, upon his accession to the throne of
his ancestors, a loyal congratulatory address was voted
by the members of the University of Cambridge in full senate.
This was shortly afterwards presented to his Majesty
at St. James       s Palace by the then Vice-Chancellor,
Dr. George Thackery, D.D., Provost of King       s College,
at the head of a large body of the heads of colleges, and
others, en robe. His majesty not only received it most
graciously, but with that truly English expression that
goes home to the bosom of every Briton, told Dr. Thackery
he        should shortly take pot-luck with him in Cambridge.       
The term, too, is worthy of particular notice,
since it expresses his Majesty       s kind consideration for the
contents of the university chest, and the pockets of its
members. Oxford, it is well known, is still smarting under
the heavy charges incident upon the memorable visit
of his late Majesty, George the Fourth, in 1814, with the
Emperor Alexander and the King of Prussia and their
suites. It would be no drawback upon the popularity of
princes if they did take        pot-luck        with their subjects oftener
than they do. Let there be no drawback upon hospitality,
but let the        feast of reason and the flow of soul       
suffice for the costly banquet. In olden times, our monarchs
took pot-luck both at Oxford, Cambridge, and elsewhere,
without their subjects being the less loyal. Queen
Elizabeth and James the First and Second were frequent
visitors at both those seats of learning. Elizabeth, indeed,
that flower of British monarchs, suffered no designing minister
to shake her confidence in her people       s loyalty. She
did not confine her movements to the dull routine of two
or three royal palaces,       her palace was her empire. She
went about        doing good        by the light of her countenance.
[Pg 66]
She, and not her minister, was the people       s idol. I therefore
come to the conclusion, that the expressed determination
of his majesty, William the Fourth, to take pot-luck
with his good people of the University of Cambridge, is
the dawn of a return of those wholesome practices of which
we read in the works of our ANNALISTS, when


              Twas merry in the hall,
And their beards wagged all.       


Wood relates, amongst other humorous incidents, that


DURING QUEEN ELIZABETH       S SECOND VISIT TO OXFORD,

In September, 1592, besides plays,      c., there was a disputation
in law and physic, and, amongst many questions,
was one,              Whether the air, or meat, or drink, did most
change a man?        and a merry Doctor of that faculty, named
Richard Ratcliffe, lately Fellow of Merton College, but
now Principal of St. Alban       s Hall, going about to produce
the negative, showed forth a big, large body, a great fat
belly, a side waist, all, as he said, so changed by meat and
drink, desiring to see any other so metamorphosed by the
air. But it was concluded (by the Moderator) in the affirmative,
that air had the greater power of change. One
of the questions (the next day) was,              Whether it be lawful
to dissemble in the cause of religion?        written thus,
says Gutch,        Non est dissimulandum in causa religionis;       
       which being looked upon as a nice question,        continues
Wood,        caused much attention from the courtly auditory.
One argument, more witty than solid, that was urged by
one of the opponents, was,        It is lawful to dispute of religion
therefore        tis lawful to dissemble;        and so going on,
said,        I myself now do that which is lawful, but I do now
dissemble; ergo, it is lawful to dissemble.        (Id quod nunc
ego, de rebus divinis disputans, ego dissimulare; sed quod
nunc ego, de rebus divinis disputam, ego dissimulare est
licitum; at which her majesty and all the auditory were
very merry.)       


[Pg 67]
WHEN QUEEN ELIZABETH FIRST VISITED CAMBRIDGE,

In the year 1564, she took up her residence at the lodge
of the Provost of King       s College, which stood near the east
end of King       s Chapel. We well remember the old pile
and the solitary trees that branched beside; and much as
we admire the splendid improvements to which they have
given place, we could almost find it in our hearts to express
regret at the removal of those landmarks of the topographist.
The hall was her guard-chamber, the dining-room
her presence-chamber, and the gallery and adjoining
rooms her private apartments. Her visit lasted five days,
during which she was entertained with comedies, tragedies,
orations, disputations, and other academical exercises.
She personally visited every college, and is said to
have been so pleased with the venerable, solemn, and scholastic
appearance of Pembroke Hall, that she saluted it
with the words       


       O Domus antiqua et religiosa!       




THE FIRST DISSENTER IN ENGLAND,

According to the author of Historical Anecdotes,      c., was
Thomas Cartwright, B. D., Lady Margaret       s Professor and
Fellow of Trinity College. He and Thomas Preston (afterwards
Master of Trinity Hall,) says Fuller, during
Queen Elizabeth       s visit at Cambridge, in 1564, were appointed
two of the four disputants in the philosophy-act
before her Majesty.        Cartwright had dealt most with
the muses; Preston with the graces, adorning his learning
with comely carriage, graceful gesture, and pleasing pronunciation.
Cartwright disputed like a great, Preston
like a gentile scholar, being a handsome man; and the
Queen, upon a parity of deserts, always preferred properness
of person in conferring her favours. Hereupon, with
her looks, words, and deeds she favoured Preston, calling
him her scholler, as appears by his epitaph in Trinity Hall
chappell.


[Pg 68]


       Thomas Preston       , Scholarem,
       Quem dixit princeps Elizabetha suum,             c.


Insomuch,        continues Fuller,        that for his good disputing,
and excellent acting, in the tragedy of Dido, she bestowed
on him a pension of 20 lib. a year; whilst Cartwright received
neither reward nor commendation, whereof he not
only complained to his inward friends in Trinity College,
but also, after her Majesty       s neglect of him, began to wade
into divers opinions against her ecclesiastical government.       
And thus, according to the authority first cited, he became
the first Dissenter in England, and was deprived, subsequently,
as a matter of course, of both his fellowship and
professorship.

It was most probably for the entertainment of the Royal Elizabeth,
that one Thomas Still, M.A., of Christ       s College, Cambridge,
afterwards Bishop of Bath and Wells, composed and produced


THE FIRST ENGLISH PLAY EXTANT:

A fact no Cantab need blush at, proh pudor, though the
plot is none of the sublimest. It was printed as early as
1575, with the following


TITLE:

       A ryght pythy, pleasant, and merie Comedie, entytuled
Gammer Gurton       s Needle; played on the stage not long
ago in Christe       s College, in Cambridge, made by Mr. S.
Master of Arts. Imprynted at London, in Fleete Streeate,
beneth the Conduit, at the signe of Sainte John Evangelist,
by Thomas Colwell.        Though altogether of a comic cast,
it was not deficient in genuine humour, and is a curious
sample of the simplicity which prevailed in this country,
in the early days of dramatic art. It is in metre, is spun
out into five regular acts, and an awful piece it is, as may
be seen by the following


BRIEF SKETCH OF THE PLOT.

Gammer Gurton having lost her needle, a great hunt is
made in search of it, and her boy is directed to blow the
[Pg 69]
embers of an expiring fire, in order to light a candle to help
the search. The witch of a cat has, in the meantime, got
into the chimney, with her two fiery eyes. The boy cries,
       it is the devil of a fire!        for when he puffs, it is out,       and
when he does not, it is in.        Stir it!        bawls Gammer
Gurton. The boy does her bidding, and the cat (the fire
as he imagines) flies forthwith amongst a pile of wood.
       The house will be burnt, all hands to work!        roars the
boy, and the cat is discovered by a priest (more cunning
than the rest.) This ends the episode, with which the main
plot and catastrophe vie. Gammer Gurton, it seems, had,
the day before, been mending her man Hodge       s breeches.
Now Hodge, in some game of merriment, was to be punished,
for some default, with three slaps on the breech, to be
administered by the brawny hand of one of his fellow-bumpkins.
To that end, his head is laid in Gammer Gurton       s
lap; the first slap is given, Hodge bellows out with
pain, and, oh! joyful announcement, on searching for the
cause of his affliction, the needle is discovered, buried up
to the eye in poor Hodge       s posterior portion. The needle
is then extracted with becoming demonstrations, and the
curtain falls.

Amongst other interesting matters associated with the
memory of Queen Elizabeth (beside that of her having
given Cambridge that admirable body of statutes upon
which all laws for their governance still continue to be
framed,) are the following memoranda, extracted by Dyer
from Baker       s MSS. in the public library of the University:       

       The 26th daye of Julie, 1578, the Queene       s Majestie came in her
progresse intended to Norfolk, to Audley End, at the town of Waldren,
accompanied by the Lorde Treasurer, High Chancellor of the University
of Cambridge. The Vice Chancellor and Masters of Colleges thoughte
meete and convenient for the dischardge of dutie, that the said
Vice-Chancellor and Hedds of Coll. should shewe themselves of the
Courte, and welcome her Grace into these quarters.        About the end of
his oration, the orator (Mr. Bridgewater of King       s College) makes
mention, that        Mr. Doctor Howland, then vice-chancellor,
[Pg 70]
maketh his three ordinarie curtesies, and then kneeling at her
Majesty       s feete, presenting unto her       


A NEWE TESTAMENT IN GREEK,

Of Robert Stephens       s first printing, folio, bound in redd velvett,
and lymmed with gold; the arms of England sett upon eche syde of the
booke very faire; and on the thirde leafe of the booke, being faire
and cleane paper, was also sett and painted in colours the arms of
the Universitie, with these writings following: Regi        Majestati
deditissim        Academi        Cantabrigiensis Insignia (viz. quatuor Leones cum
Bibl.      c.) Also, with the booke, the Vice-Chancellor presented a pair
of gloves, perfumed and garnished, with embroiderie and goldsmithe       s
wourke, pr. 60s. and these verses:       


       SEMPER UNA.


       Una quod es semper, quod semper es optima, Princeps,
Quam bene conveniunt h       c duo verba tibi?
Quod pia, quod prudens, quod casta, innuba virgo
Semper es, hoc etiam semper es una modo.

       Et populum quod ames, populo quod amata vicissim
Semper es, hic constans semper et una manes,
O utinam; quoniam sic semper es una, liceret
Una te nobis semper, Eliza, frui?       


Since Cambridge has the merit of producing the first
English play, it is but justice here to add, that


THE SCHOLARS OF CHRIST CHURCH, OXFORD,
INVENTED MOVEABLE SCENES.

This merit is claimed for them by the Oxford historians,
and allowed by the historians of the stage, though they
have not agreed of the exact period. We are informed,
in Leland       s Collectanea, that        the stage did vary three
times in the acting of one tragedy.        In other words,
there were three scenes employed; but these, it is said by
Chalmers, in his History of Oxford University, were the
invention of Inigo Jones; and the exhibition, it appears,
took place in the Hall of Christ Church, in 1636, (the
year Wood places the invention in,) for the entertainment
[Pg 71]
of the unfortunate Charles the First and his Queen, when,
says our annalist, a comedy was performed for their amusement,
entitled,        The Passions Calmed, or the Settling of
the Floating,        written by Strode, the Public Orator, and
moveable scenery introduced with suitable variations; and
though there is pretty conclusive evidence that this was
not the first time moveable scenes,      c. had been introduced,
it is evident they had not come into general use, from
the fact that, after the departure of the King and his suite,
the dresses and scenery were sent to Hampton Court, at
the express desire of the Queen, but with a wish, suggested
by the Chancellor of Oxford, the ill-fated Archbishop
Laud, that they might not come into the hands of the common
players, which was accordingly promised. Leland
thinks, however, that moveable scenes were better managed,
before this, at Cambridge; and I know not, he says,
whether the invention may not be carried back to the year
1583, when the celebrated Polish prince, Alesco, was at
Oxford, and for whose entertainment, says Wood (who
gives an interesting account of all the particulars of that
famous Oxford gaudy,) the tragedy of Dido was acted in
the Hall of Christ Church, decorated with scenes illustrative
of the play, and the exhibition of        the tempest, wherein
it rained small comfits, rose-water, and new artificial
snow, was very strange to the beholders.        But other
authorities place the invention in 1605, when


JAMES THE FIRST AND HIS COURT CAME TO
OXFORD,

And was entertained in the Hall of Christ Church,        with
the Latin comedy of Vertumnus, written by Dr. Matthew
Gwinne, of St. John       s College, Oxford, and performed by
the students of that house, without borrowing a single actor;
and it was upon this occasion that the humming of
his Majesty took place, referred to in my Preface. In
1621, when James and his court happened to be at Woodstock,
the scholars of Christ Church enacted Barton Holyday       s
comedy of                                                             , or the Marriage of the Arts:
but his Majesty relished it so little, as to offer several
times to withdraw, and was only prevented by some of his
[Pg 72]
courtiers representing that his doing so would be a cruel
disappointment. This incident gave rise to the well-known
epigram       


       At Christ-Church marriage, done before the king,
Lest that those mates should want an offering,
The king himself did offer       what, I pray?
He offered twice or thrice to go away.       




OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE SEEMED RIVALS

At this period. Wood states, in his Annals, that when King James was
entertained at Oxford, in 1605, divers Cambridge scholars went thither
out of novelty, to see and hear; and some that pretended to be wits
made copies of verses on that solemnity, of which, he says, I have met
with one that runs       


To Oxonforde the king is gone,
With all his mighty peers,
That hath in grace maintained us,
These four or five long years.

Such a king he hath been,
As the like was never seen:
Knights did ride by his side,
Evermore to be his guide:
A thousand knights, and forty thousand knights,
Knights of forty pounds a year.


which some attribute to one Lake. This example, he
adds, was followed by the Oxonians, when James visited
Cambridge in 1614, and        many idle songs        were made
by them upon the proceedings at Cambridge, the most celebrated
of which is the one entitled,        A Grave Poem, as it
was presented in Latin by Divines and others, before his
Majesty at Cambridge, by way of Enterlude, stiled        Liber
novus de adventu Regis ad Cantabrigiam,        faithfully
done into English, with some liberal advantage, made rather
to be sung than red, to the tune of        Bonny Nell,              
which poem, says Wood, may be seen in the works of the
witty Bishop Corbet (by whom it was written,)        printed
in 1647.        But in so saying our annalist not only lies under
[Pg 73]
a mistake, but Mr. Gutch, his editor, has not detected
it. The poem is not in the edition of 1647, but in that of
1672, which is the third, corrected and enlarged, and
       printed by J. C. for William Crooke, at the Green Dragoon,
without Temple Bar;        as all may see who will consult
the said editions, both extant in the library of the British
Museum. The poem is comprised in twenty-six stanzas,
as follows:       


It is not yet a fortnight, since
Lutetia entertained our Prince,
And wasted both a studied toy,
As long as was the siege of Troy:
And spent herself for full five days
In speeches, exercise, and plays.

To trim the town, great care before
Was tane by th        Lord Vice-Chancellor,
Both morn and eve he cleared the way,
The streets he gravell       d thrice a day;
One stripe of March-dust for to see,
No Provost would give more than he.

Their colledges were new be-painted,
Their founders eke were new be-sainted;
Nothing escaped, nor post, nor door,
Nor gete, nor rail, nor b              d, nor wh              :
You could not know (oh, strange mishap!)
Whether you saw the town or map.

But the pure house of Emanuel,
Would not be like proud Jesebel,
Nor show herself before the king
An hypocrite, or painted thing:
But that the ways might all prove fair,
Conceiv       d a tedious mile of prayer.

Upon the look       d-for seventh of March,
Out went the townsmen all in starch,
Both band and bead into the field,
Where one a speech could hardly wield;
For needs he would begin his stile,
The king being from him half a mile.

They gave the king a piece of plate,
Which they hop       d never came too late;
And cry       d, Oh! look not in, great king,
For there is in it just nothing:
And so preferred with time and gate,
A speech as empty as their plate.
[Pg 74]
Now, as the king came near the town,
Each one ran crying up and down,
Alas, poor Oxford, thou       rt undone,
For now the king       s past Trompington,
And rides upon his brave grey Dapple,
Seeing the top of King       s-Colledge chappel.

Next rode his lordship on a nag,
Whose coat was blue, whose ruff was shag,
And then began his reverence
To speak most eloquent non-sense:
See how (quoth he) most mighty prince,
For very joy my horse doth wince.

What cryes the town? what we? (said he)
What cryes the University?
What cryes the boyes? what every thing?
Behold, behold, yon comes the king:
And every period he bedecks,
With En et Ecce venit Rex.

Oft have I warn       d (quoth he) our dirt,
That no silk stockings should be hurt;
But we in vain strive to be fine,
Unless your Grace       s sun doth shine;
And with the beams of your bright eye,
You will be pleased our streets to dry.

Now come we to the wonderment,
Of Christendom, and eke of Kent,
The Trinity; which to surpass,
Doth Deck her spokesman by a glass:
Who, clad in gay and silken weeds,
Thus opes his mouth, hark how he speeds.

I wonder what your Grace doth here,
Who had expected been 12 year,
And this your son, fair Carolus,
That is so Jacobissimus;
There       s none, of all your Grace refuses,
You are most welcome to our Muses.

Although we have no bells to jingle,
Yet can we shew a fair quadrangle,
Which, though it ne       er was graced with king,
Yet sure it is a goodly thing:
My warning       s short, no more I       ll say,
Soon you shall see a gallant play.

But nothing was so much admired
As were their plays, so well attired;
Nothing did win more praise of mine,
[Pg 75]Than did their Actors most divine:
So did they drink their healths divinely,
So did they skip and dance so finely.

Their plays had sundry grave wise factors,
A perfect diocess of Actors
Upon the stage; for I am sure that
There was both bishop, pastor, curat:
Nor was this labour light or small,
The charge of some was pastoral.

Our plays were certainly much worse,
For they had a brown hobby-horse,
Which did present unto his Grace
A wondrous witty ambling pace:
But we were chiefly spoyl       d by that
Which was six hours of God knows what.

His Lordship then was in a rage,
His Lordship lay upon the stage,
His Lordship cry       d, All would be marr       d:
His Lordship lov       d a-life the guard,
And did invite those mighty men,
To what think you? Even to a Hen.

He knew he was to use their might
To help to keep the door at night,
And well bestow       d he though his Hen,
That they might Tolebooth Oxford men.
He thought it did become a lord
To threaten with that bug-bear word.

Now pass we to the Civil Law,
And eke the doctors of the spaw,
Who all perform       d their parts so well,
Sir Edward Ratcliff bore the bell,
Who was, by the king       s own appointment,
To speak of Spells and Magic Ointment.

The Doctors of the Civil Law,
Urged ne       er a reason worth a straw;
And though they went in silk and satten,
They, Thomson-like clip       d the king       s Latine;
But yet his Grace did pardon then
All treasons against Priscian.

Here no man spoke aught to the point,
But all they said was out of joint;
Just like the Chappel ominous,
In th        Colledge called God with us,
Which truly doth stand much awry,
Just north and south, yes verily.
[Pg 76]
Philosophers did well their parts,
Which proved them Masters of the Arts;
Their Moderator was no fool,
He far from Cambridge kept a school:
The country did such store afford,
The Proctors might not speak a word.

But to conclude, the king was pleased,
And of the court the town was eased:
But Oxford though (dear sister hark it)
The king is gone but to New-Market,
And comes again ere it be long,
Then you may sing another song.

The king being gone from Trinitie,
They make a scramble for degree;
Masters of all sorts and all ages,
Keepers, subsizers, lackayes, pages,
Who all did throng to come abroad,
With pray make me now, good my Lord.

They prest his lordship wondrous hard,
His lordship then did want the guard,
So did they throng him for the nonce,
Till he bless them all at once,
And cry       d Hodiissime:
Omnes Magistri estote.

Nor is this all which we do sing,
For of your praise the world must ring:
Reader, unto your tackling look,
For there is coming forth a book,
Will spoyl Joseph Bernesius
The sale of Rex Platonicus.


His Majesty was, as usual, entertained with speeches, disputations,
and dramatic exhibitions. Fuller relates, that the following


EXTRAORDINARY DIVINITY ACT,

Or Disputation, was kept at Cambridge before this prince,
during this visit, where Dr. John Davenant (afterwards
Bishop of Sarum) was respondent, and Dr. Richardson,
amongst others, opponent. The question was maintained,
in the negative, concerning the excommunicating of kings.
Dr. Richardson vigorously pressed the practice of St.
Ambrose, who excommunicated the emperor Theodosius,       insomuch,
says Fuller, that the king, in a great passion,
[Pg 77]
returned,              Profecto fuit hoc ab Ambrosio insolentissime
factum.        To which Dr. R. rejoined,              Responsum vere
Regium, et Alexandro dignum, hoc non est argumentu
dissolvere, sed desecare,              and so, sitting down, discontinued
from any further argument. It was for the entertainment
of James during this visit, that


THE FAMOUS CAMBRIDGE LATIN COMEDY,

Entitled Ignoramus, was first enacted. It originated in
a dispute on the question of precedency, in 1611, when the
Mayor, whose name was Thomas Smart, had seated himself
in a superior place in the Guildhall of the town, in the
presence of the Vice-Chancellor of the University, who
asserted his right to the same; but the Mayor refused to
resign the seat, till the Vice-Chancellor       s attendants forcibly
ejected him. The dispute was laid before the Privy
Council, who decided in favour of the Vice-Chancellor.
But during the progress of the affair, the Recorder of Cambridge,
named Brankyn, stoutly defended the Mayor and
Corporation against the rights of the University. This it
was that induced the author of the play, Geo. Ruggle,
Fellow of Clare-Hall, to show him up, in the pedantic,
crafty, pragmatical character of Ignoramus; and if lawyer
Brankyn, it is said, had not actually set the dispute agoing,
he greatly contributed to keep it alive. At this time King
James had long been expected to visit Cambridge, who had
a strong prejudice against lawyers, and a ruling passion to
be thought the patron of literature. The circumstances
suggested to Ruggle the propriety of exposing lawyer
Brankyn before his Majesty, in the above character, and
to render it the more forcible, he resolved to adopt the
common-law forms, and the cant and barbarous phraseology
of lawyers in the ordinary discourse. It was, therefore,
necessary that he should make himself master of that
dialect, in which almost the best amongst them were accustomed
to write and even to discourse; a jargon, says
Wilson, in his Memorabilia Cantabrigi       , could not but be
offensive to a classical car. He, therefore, took more than
ordinary pains to acquaint himself with the technical terms
of the profession, and to mark the abuse of them, of which
[Pg 78]
he has admirably availed himself in the formation of the
character of Ignoramus, who not only transacts business,
but        woos in language of the Pleas and Bench.        The comedy
was enacted before his Majesty by the members of the
University, and he was so much delighted with, on dit,
either the wit or absurdity, that he caused it to be played a
second time, and once at Newmarket. During one of these
representations, says Dr. Peckard, formerly Master of
Magdalen College, in his Life of Mr. Farrer,        the King
called out aloud,        Treason! Treason!        The gentlemen about
him being anxious to know what disturbed his Majesty, he
said,        That the writer and performers had acted their parts
so well, that he should die of laughter.               It was during the
performance of this play, according to Rapin and others,
that James was first struck with the personal beauty of
George Villiers, who afterwards became Duke of Buckingham,
and supplanted Somerset in his favour. Thomas
Gibbons, Esq. says, in his Collection, forming part of the
Harleian MSS. in the British Museum, (No. 980, art. 173.)
that        the comedy of Ignoramus, supposed to be by Mr.
Ruggle, is but a translation of the Italian comedy of Baptista
Porta, entitled Trapulario, as may be seen by the
comedy itself, in Clare-hall Library, with Mr. Ruggle       s
notes and alterations thereof.        A literary relique that is
said to have now disappeared; but it is to be hoped, for the
credit of a learned Society, that it is a mistake. Dyer in his
Privileges of Cambridge (citing vol. ii. fol. 149 of Hare       s
MSS.) gives the judgment of the Earl Marshal of England,
which settled this famous controversy. The original
document is extant in the Crown Office, in these words:              I
do set down,      c. that the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge
is to be taken in commission before the Mayor. King
James, also, in the third of his raigne, by letters under the
privy signett, commandeth the Lord Ellesmere, Chancellor
of England,


TO PLACE THE VICE-CHANCELLOR BEFORE THE MAYOR,

in all commissions of the peace or otherwise, where public shew of degrees is to be made.

AN OXONIAN AND A BISHOP,

Who had half a score of the softer sex to lisp        Papa,        not
one of whom his lady was conjuror enough        to get off,        was
one day accosted in Piccadilly by an old Oxford chum,
with,        I hope I see your Lordship well.               Pretty well,
for a man who is daily smothered in petticoats, and has ten
daughters and a wife to carve for,        was the reply.



BRIEF NOTICE OF THE BOAR       S HEAD CAROL, AS SUNG IN QUEEN       S COLLEGE,
OXFORD, ON CHRISTMAS DAY.

       The earliest collection of Christmas carols supposed to
have been published,        says Hone, in his Every-Day Book,
       is only known from the last leaf of a volume, printed by
Wynkyn Worde, in the year 1521. This precious scrap
was picked up by Tom Hearne; Dr. Rawlinson purchased
it at his decease in a volume of tracts, and bequeathed it to
the Bodleian Library. There are two carols upon it: one,
       a caroll of huntynge,        is reprinted in the last edition of
Juliana Berner       s        Boke of St. Alban       s;        the other,        a caroll
bringing in the boar       s head,        is in Mr. Dibdin       s edition of
       Ames,        with a copy of it as it is now sung in Queen       s
College, Oxford, every Christmas Day. Dr. Bliss of Oxford
also printed on a sheet, for private distribution, a few
copies of this, and Anthony Wood       s version of it, with notices
concerning the custom, from the handwriting of
Wood and Dr. Rawlinson, in the Bodleian Library. Ritson,
in his ill-tempered        Observations on Warton       s History
of English Poetry,        (1782, 4to., p. 37,) has a Christmas
carol upon bringing up the boar       s head, from an ancient
MS. in his possession, wholly different from Dr. Bliss       s.
The        Bibliographical Miscellanies        (Oxford, 1814, 4to.)
contains seven carols from a collection in one volume, in
the possession of Dr. Cotton, of Christ-Church College, Oxford,
       imprynted at London, in the Poultry, by Richard
Kele, dwelling at the longe shop vnder Saynt Myldrede       s
Chyrche,               probably between 1546 and 1552.        I had an
opportunity of perusing this exceedingly curious volume
[Pg 80]
(Mr. Hone,) which is supposed to be unique, and has since
passed into the hands of Mr. Freeling.               According to
Aubrey       s MS., in the Coll. Ashmol. Mus., Oxford,        says
a writer in the Morning Herald of the 25th of Dec., 1833,
       before the last Civil Wars, in gentlemen       s houses, at
Christmas, the first dish that was brought to the table was
a boar       s head, with a lemon in his mouth. At Qeeun       s
College, Oxford,        adds this writer,        they still retain this
custom; the bearer of it brings it into the hall, singing, to
an old tune, an old Latin rhyme,        Caput apri defero,             c.
       The carol, according to Hearne, Ames, Warton, and
Ritson,        says Dr. Dibdin, in his edition of the second, is
as follows:       


A CAROL BRINGING IN THE BORES HEED.


Caput apri differo
Reddens laudes domino.
The bore       s heed in hande bring I,
With garlands gay and rosemary,
I praye you all synge merely,
Qui estis in convivio.

The bores heed I understande
Is the thefte servyce in this lande,
Take where ever it be fande,
Servite cum cantico.

Be gladde lordes bothe more and lasse,
For this hath ordeyned our stewarde,
To chere you all this Christmasse,
The bores heed with mustarde.


       This carol (says Warton,) with many alterations, is yet retained at
Queen       s College, Oxford,        though        other ancient carols occur with
Latin burthens or Latin intermixtures.        But,        Being anxious to obtain
a correct copy of this ballad,        says Dr. Dibdin, in his Ames,        as I
had myself heard it sung in the Hall of Queen       s College, I wrote to
the Rev. Mr. Dickinson, Tutor of the College, to favour me with an
account of it: his answer, which may gratify the curious, is here
subjoined.


              Queen       s College, June 7th, 1811.


              Dear Sir,       I have much pleasure in transmitting you
[Pg 81]
a copy of the old Boar       s Head Song, as it has been sung in our
College-hall, every Christmas Day, within my remembrance. There are
some barbarisms in it, which seem to betoken its antiquity. It is sung
to the common chaunt of the prose version of the Psalms in cathedrals;
at least, whenever I have attended the service at Magdalen or New
College Chapels, I have heard the Boar       s Head strain continually
occurring in the Psalms.


              The boar       s head in hand bring I,
Bedeck       d with bays and rosemary;
And I pray you, my masters, be merry,
Quot estis in convivio.
Caput apri defero
Reddens laudes Domino.

              The boar       s head, as I understand,
Is the rarest dish in all this land,
Which thus bedeck       d with a gay garland,
Let us servire Cantico.
Caput apri defero
Reddens laudes Domino.

              Our steward hath provided this
In honour of the King of Bliss;
Which on this day to be served is,
In Regimensi Atrio.
Caput apri defero
Reddens laudes Domino.              


       The following,        adds the Doctor,        is Hearne       s minute
account of it: (Hist. Guil. Neubrig. vol. iii. p. 743:)        I
will beg leave here,        says the pugnacious Oxford antiquary,
       to give an exact copy of the Christmas Carol upon the
Boar       s Head, (which is an ancient dish, and was brought
up by King Henry I. with trumpets, before his son, when
his said son was crowned) as I have it in an old fragment,
(for I usually preserve even fragments of old books) of the
Christmas Carols printed by Wynkyn de Worde, (who as
well as Richard Pynson, was servant to William Caxton,
who was the first that printed English books, though not
the first printer in England, as is commonly said,) printing
being exercised at Oxford in 1468, if not sooner, which
was several years before he printed anything at Westminster,
by which it will be perceived how much the said carol
[Pg 82]
is altered, as it is sung in some places even now, from
what it was at first. It is the last thing, it seems, of the
book (which I never yet saw entire,) and at the same time
I think it proper also to add to the printer       s conclusion,
for this reason, at least, that such as write about our first
printers, may have some notice of the date of this book,
and the exact place where printed, provided they cannot
be able to meet with it, as I believe they will find it pretty
difficult to do, it being much laid aside, about the time that
some of David       s Psalms came to be used in its stead.              


THIS CUSTOM

Is briefly noticed in Pointer       s        Oxoniensis Academia,        as
       that of having a boar       s head, or the figure of one in wood,
brought up in the hall every year on Christmas Day, ushered
in very solemnly with an old song, in memory of a
noble exploit (as tradition goes,) by a scholar (a Tabardar)
of this college, in killing a wild boar in Shotover Wood.       
That is, having wandered into the said wood, which was not
far from Oxford, with a copy of Aristotle in his hand (for
the Oxonians were of old logicians of the orthodox school in
which an Alexander the Great was bred,) and if the latter,
as a pupil who sat at the foot of Aristotle, conquered a
world, no wonder our Tabardar, as a disciple being attacked
by a wild boar, who came at him with extended jaws,
intending to make but a mouthful of him, was enabled to
conquer so rude a beast, which he did by thrusting the Aristotle
down the boar       s throat, crying, in the concluding
words of the 5th stanza of the following song              Gr       cum
est.        The animal of course fell prostrate at his feet, was
carried in triumph to the college, and no doubt served up
with an        old song,        as Mr. Pointer says, in memory of this
       noble exploit.        The witty Dr. Buckler, however, is not
satisfied with this brief notice of Mr. Pointer       s: but says,
in his never-to-be-forgotten expos        , or        Complete Vindication,       
of The All-Souls        Mallard (of which anon,)        I am
apt to fear, that it is a fixed principle in Mr. Pointer to
ridicule every ceremony and solemn institution that comes
in his way, however venerable it may be for its antiquity
and significance;        and after quoting Mr. Pointer       s words,
[Pg 83]
he adds, with his unrivalled irony,        now, notwithstanding
this bold hint to the contrary, it seemeth to me to be altogether
unaccountable and incredible, that a polite and
learned society should be so far depraved, in its taste, and
so much in love with a block-head, as to eat it. But as I
have never had the honour of dining at a boar       s head, and
there are many gentlemen more nearly concerned and better
informed, as well as better qualified, in every respect,
to refute this calumny than I am, I shall avoid entering into
a thorough discussion of this subject. I know it is given
out by Mr. Pointer       s enemies, that he hath been employed
by some of the young seceders from that college, to throw
out a Story of the Wooden-head, in order to countenance
the complaints of those gentlemen about short commons,
and the great deficiency of mutton, beef,      c.; and, indeed,
I must say, that nothing could have better answered their
purpose, in this respect, than in proving, according to the
insinuation, that the chief dish at one of their highest festivals,
was nothing but a log of Wood bedeck       d with bays
and rosemary; but surely this cannot be credited, after the
university has been informed by the best authority, and in
the most public Manner, that a young Nobleman, who
lately completed his academical education at that house,
was, during his whole residence, not only very well satisfied
but extremely delighted with the college commons.       

In the Oxford Sausage is the following


RYGHTE EXCELLENTE SONG IN HONOUR OF THE CELEBRATION OF
THE BOAR       S HEAD, AT QUEEN       S COLLEGE, OXFORD.

Tam Marti quam Mercurio.


I sing not of Rome or Grecian mad games.
The Pythian, Olympic, and such like hard names;
Your patience awhile, with submission, I beg,
I strive but to honour the feast of Coll. Reg.
Derry down, down, down, derry down.

No Thracian brawls at our rites e       er prevail,
We temper our mirth with plain sober mild Ale;
The tricks of Old Circe deter us from Wine:
Though we honour a boar, we won       t make ourselves Swine.
Derry down,      c.
[Pg 84]
Great Milo was famous for slaying his Ox,
Yet he proved but an ass in cleaving of blocks:
But we had a hero for all things was fit,
Our Motto displays both his Valour and Wit.
Derry down,      c.

Stout Hercules labour       d, and look       d mighty big,
When he slew the half-starved Erymanthian Pig;
But we can relate such a stratagem taken,
That the stoutest of Boars could not save his own Bacon.
Derry down,      c.

So dreadful his bristle-back       d foe did appear,
You       d have sworn he had got the wrong Pig by the ear,
But instead of avoiding the mouth of the beast,
He ramm       d in a volume, and cried       Gr       cum est.
Derry down,      c.

In this gallant action such fortitude shown is,
As proves him no coward, nor tender Adonis;
No Armour but Logic; by which we may find,
That Logic       s the bulwark of body and mind.
Derry down,      c.

Ye Squires that fear neither hills nor rough rocks,
And think you       re full wise when you out-wit a Fox;
Enrich your poor brains, and expose them no more,
Learn Greek, and seek glory from hunting the Boar.
Derry down,      c.





CLEAVING THE BLOCK,

Is another custom that either was, or is, annually celebrated at
Queen       s College, Oxford, not pro bono publico, it seems, but pro
bono cook-o! and has a reference, probably, to the exploit in which
Milo        proved but an ass,        as observed in the second line of the third
verse of the foregoing song. On dit, every Christmas, New Year       s, or
some other day, at that season of the year, a block of wood is
placed at the hall-door, where the cook stands with his cleaver,
which he delivers to each member of the College, as he passes out of
the Hall, who endeavours, at one stroke, to sever the block of wood;
failing to do which, he throws down half-a-crown, in which sum he is
mulct. This is done by every one in succession, should they, as is
invariably the case, prove themselves asses in        cleaving of blocks.       
[Pg 85]
But should any one out-Milo Milo, he would be entitled to all the
half-crowns previously forfeited: otherwise the whole goes to the
cook.



THE MISFORTUNE OF BEING LITTLE.

Lord Byron has said, that a man is unfortunate whose
name will admit of being punned upon. The lament might
apply to all peculiarities of person and habit. Dr. Joseph
Jowett, the late regius professor of civil law at Cambridge,
though a learned man, an able lecturer, one that generously
fostered talent in rising young men, and a dilettante
musician of a refined and accurate taste, was remarkable
for some singularities, as smallness of stature, and for gardening
upon a small scale. This gave the late Bishop
Mansel or Porson (for it has been attributed to both, and
both were capable of perpetrating it) an occasion to throw off


THE FOLLOWING LATIN EPIGRAM:


Exiguum hunc hortum Jowettulus iste
Exiguus, vallo et muriit exiguo:
Exiguo hoc horto forsan Jowettulus iste
Exiguus mentem prodidit exiguum.


IN ENGLISH, AS MUCH AS TO SAY:


A little garden little Jowett had,
And fenced it with a little palisade:
Because this garden made a little talk,
He changed it to a little gravel walk:
And if you       ld know the taste of little Jowett,
This little garden doth a little show it.




BISHOPS BLOMFIELD AND MONK,

Who had the honour to edit his Adversaria, can both, it
is said, bear witness to the fact, that Porson was unlike
many pedants who make a display of their brilliant parts
to surprise rather than enlighten; he was liberal in the
extreme, and truly amiable in communicating his knowledge
[Pg 86]
to young men of talent and industry, and would tell them all they
wanted to know in a plain and direct manner, without any attempt to
display his superiority. All, however, agree that the time for
profiting by Porson       s learning was inter bibendum, for then, as
Chaucer says of the Sompnour       


       When he well dronkin had with wine,
Then would he speak ne word but Latine.       


More than one distinguished judge of his merits


PRONOUNCED HIM THE GREATEST SCHOLAR IN EUROPE,

And he never appeared so sore, says one who knew him well, as when a
Wakefield or a Hermann offered to set him right, or hold their
tapers to light him on his way. Their doing so gave him occasion to
compare them to four-footed animals, guided only by instinct; and in
future, he said, he        would take care they should not reach what he
wrote with their paws, though they stood on their hind legs.        I may
here very appropriately repeat the fact, that


PORSON WAS A GREAT MASTER OF IAMBIC MEASURE,

As he has shown in his preface to the second edition of his Hecuba.
The German critic, Hermann, however, whom he makes to say, in his
notes on the Medea,        We Germans understand quantity better than the
English,        accuses him of being more dictatorial than explanatory in
his metrical decisions. Upon this the professor fired the following
epigram at the German:       


                                                                                                            
                                                        ,                            
                   ,                                             ,



                                                                                                                ,
                                                                                                             
                                    .


The Germans in Greek,
Are sadly to seek;
Not five in five score,
But ninety-five more;
All, save only Hermann,
And Hermann       s a German.



[Pg 87]
PORSON AND WAKEFIELD

Had but little regard for each other, and when the latter published
his Hecuba, Porson said       


       What       s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
That he should publish her?       


At another time, being teased for his opinion of a modern
Latin poem, his reply was,              There is a great deal in it
from Horace, and a great deal from Virgil: but nothing
Horatian and nothing Virgilian.       

Dr. Parr once asked the professor,        what he thought of
the origin of evil?               I see no good in it,        was his answer.

The same pugnacious divine told him one day, that
       with all his learning, he did not think him well versed
in metaphysics.               Sir,        said Porson,        I suppose you
mean your metaphysics.       

It is not generally known that during the time he was
employed in deciphering the famed Rosetta stone, in the
collection of the British Museum, which is black,


HE OBTAINED THE SOUBRIQUET OF JUDGE BLACKSTONE.

And it is here worthy of remark, that it was to another
celebrated Cantab, Porson       s contemporary, Dr. Edward
Daniel Clarke, the traveller, that we are indebted for that
relique of antiquity. He happened to be in Egypt at the
time the negociation for the evacuation of that country by
the remnant of Bonaparte       s army was progressing between
Lord Hutchinson and the French General, Menou. Knowing
the French were in possession of the famed Rosetta
stone, amongst other reliques, Clarke       s sagacity induced
him to point out to Lord Hutchinson the importance of
possessing it. The consequence was, he was named as
one of the parties to negociate with Menou for the surrender
of that and their other Egyptian monuments and valuable
reliques which the s        avans attached to the French
army had sedulously collected; and notwithstanding every
impediment and even insult were heaped upon, and thrown
in Clarke       s way, his perseverance was proof against it all. Indeed,
[Pg 88]


DR. EDWARD DANIEL CLARKE,

Whose name and writings are now justly celebrated throughout the
civilized world, was from his very childhood (says his biographer,
contemporary, and friend, the learned Principal of King       s College,
London,) an enthusiast in whatever he undertook, and always possessed,
in a very high degree, the power of interesting the minds of others
towards any objects that occupied his own. This was remarkably
illustrated by his manufacture of


A BALLOON, WITH WHICH HE AMUSED THE UNIVERSITY,

In the third year of his residence, when not more than
eighteen, probably the only instance of a member of either
university constructing one. It        was magnificent in size,
and splendid in its decorations, and was constructed and
man      uvred, from first to last, entirely by himself. It
was the contrivance of many anxious thoughts, and the
labour of many weeks, to bring it to what he wished; and
when, at last, it was completed to his satisfaction, and had
been suspended for some days in the college hall, of which
it occupied the whole height, he announced a time for its
ascension. There was nothing at that period very new in
balloons, or very curious in the species he had adopted;
but by some means he had contrived to disseminate, not
only within his own college, but throughout the whole
university, a prodigious curiosity respecting the fate of
this experiment; and a vast concourse of persons assembled,
both within and without the college walls; and the
balloon having been brought to its station, the grass-plot
within the cloisters of Jesus        College, was happily launched
by himself, amidst the applause of all ranks and degrees
of gownsmen, the whole scene succeeding to his wish; nor
is it very easy to forget the delight which flashed from his
eye, and the triumphant wave of his cap, when the machine,
with its little freight (a kitten,) having cleared the college
battlements, was seen floating in full security over the
towers of the great gate, followed in its course by several
persons on horseback, who had undertaken to recover it;
[Pg 89]
and all went home delighted with an exhibition upon which
nobody would have ventured, in such a place, but himself.
But to gratify and amuse others was ever the source of the
greatest satisfaction to him.        This was one of those early
displays of that spirit of enterprise which was so gloriously
developed in his subsequent wanderings through the dreary
regions of the north, over the classic shores of mouldering
Greece, of Egypt, and of Palestine, the scenes of which,
and their effects upon his vivid imagination and sanguine
spirit, he has so admirably depicted in his writings. This
eminent traveller used to say, that the old proverb,


       WITH TOO MANY IRONS IN THE FIRE SOME MUST BURN,       

       Was a lie.        Use poker, tongs, shovel, and all,       only keep them
all stirring, was his creed. Few had the capacity of keeping them so
effectually stirring as he had. Nature seemed to have moulded him,
head and heart, to be in a degree a contradiction to the wise saws of
experience.



THREE BLUE BEANS IN A BLADDER.

Dr. Bentley said of our celebrated Cambridge Professor, Joshua Barnes,
that        he knew about as much Greek as an Athenian blacksmith,        but he
was certainly no ordinary scholar, and few have excelled him in his
tact at throwing of        trifles light as air        in that language, of which
his following version of three blue beans in a bladder is a sample:


                                                                   
                                                             
                                                .


Equal to this is the following spondaic on


THE THREE UNIVERSITY BEDELS,

By Kit Smart, who well deserved, though Dr. Johnson denied him, a place
in his British Poets. He possessed great wit and sprightliness of conversation,
which would readily flow off in extemporaneous verse, says Dyer, and
[Pg 90]
the three university bedels all happening to be fat men, he thus
immortalized them:


       Pinguia tergeminorum abdomina Bedellorum.       


(Three bedels sound, with paunches fat and round.)



NO SCHOLAR IN EUROPE UNDERSTOOD THEM BETTER.

It is recorded of another Cambridge Clarke, the Rev.
John, who was successively head-master of the grammar
schools of Skipton, Beverley, and Wakefield in Yorkshire,
and obtained the honourable epithet of        The good
school-master              that when he presented himself to our great
critic, Dr. Richard Bentley, at Trinity College, Cambridge,
for admission, the Doctor proceeded to examine
him, as is usual, and placed before him a page of the Greek
text, with the Scholia, for the purpose.        He explained
the whole,        says his memorialist, Dr. Zouch,        with the
utmost perspicuity, elegance, and ease. Dr. Bentley immediately
presented him with a valuable edition of the
Comedies of Aristophanes, telling him, in language peculiar
to himself, that no scholar in Europe understood them
better, one person only excepted.        Dyer has the following


BENTLEIAN ANECDOTE

In his Supplement, but supposes it cannot be charged upon
the Doctor,        the greatest Greek scholar of his age.        He
is said to have set a scholar a copy of Greek verses, by
way of imposition, for some offence against college discipline.
Having completed his verses, he brought them to
the Doctor, who had not proceeded far in examining them
before he was struck with a passage, which he pronounced
bad Greek.        Yet, sir,        said the scholar, with submission,
       I thought I had followed good authority,        and taking a
Pindar out of his pocket, he pointed to a similar expression.
The Doctor was satisfied, but, continuing to read on, he
soon found another passage, which he said was certainly
bad Greek. The young man took his Pindar out of his
[Pg 91]
pocket again, and showed another passage, which he had
followed as his authority. The Doctor was a little nettled,
but he proceeded to the end of the verses, when he observed
another passage at the close, which he affirmed was
not classical.        Yet Pindar,        rejoined the young man,
       was my authority even here,        and he pointed out the
place which he had closely imitated.        Get along, sir,       
exclaimed the Doctor, rising from his chair in a passion,
       Pindar was very bold, and you are very impudent.       




THE GREAT GAUDY OF THE ALL-SOULS        MALLARD.

This feast is annually celebrated the 14th of January,
by the Society of All-Souls, in piam memoriam of their
founder, the famous Henry Chichele, Archbishop of Canterbury.
It is a custom at All-Souls        College (says Pointer,
in his Oxoniensis Academia,) kept up on        their
mallard-night every year, in remembrance of a huge mallard
or drake, found (as tradition goes) imprisoned in a gutter
or drain under ground, and grown to a vast bigness, at the
digging for the foundation of the college.        This mallard
had grown to a huge size, and was, it appears, of a great
age; and to account for the longevity, he cites the Ornithology
of Willughby, who observes,        that he was assured
by a friend of his, a person of very good credit, that his
father kept a goose known to be sixty years of age, and as
yet sound and lusty, and like enough to have lived many
years longer, had he not been forced to kill her, for her
mischievousness, worrying and destroying the young geese
and goslings.               And my Lord Bacon,        he adds,        in his
Natural History, says, the goose may pass among the long-livers,
though his food be commonly grass and such kind
of nourishment, especially the wild goose; wherefore this
proverb grew among the Germans, Magis senex quam
Anser nivalis       Older than a wild-goose.        He might also
have instanced the English proverb,        As tough as a Michaelmas
goose.               If a goose be such a long-lived bird,       
observes Mr. P.,        why not a duck or a drake, since I
reckon they may be both ranked in the same class, though
[Pg 92]
of a different species, as to their size, as a rat and a mouse?
And if so, this may help to give credit to our All-Souls       
mallard. However, this is certain, this mallard is the
accidental occasion of a great gaudy once a-year, and great
mirth, though the commemoration of their founder is the
chief occasion; for on this occasion is always sung,        as
extant in the Oxford Sausage, the following        merry old
song:              


THE ALL-SOULS        MALLARD.


Griffin, bustard, turkey, capon,
Let our hungry mortals gape on,
And on their bones their stomach fall hard,
But All-Souls        men have their MALLARD.
Oh! by the blood of King Edward,
Oh! by the blood of King Edward,
It was a swapping, swapping, MALLARD.

The Romans once admired a gander
More than they did their chief commander,
Because he saved, if some don       t fool us,
The place that       s called from the Head of Tolus.
Oh! by the blood,      c.

The poets feign Jove turned a swan,
But let them prove it if they can;
As for our proof,        tis not at all hard,
For it was a swapping, swapping MALLARD.
Oh! for the blood,      c.

Swapping he was from bill to eye,
Swapping he was from wing to thigh;
Swapping       his age and corporation
Out-swapped all the winged creation.
Oh! for the blood,      c.

Therefore let us sing and dance a galliard,
To the remembrance of the MALLARD;
And as the MALLARD dives in a pool,
Let us dabble, dive, and duck in a bowl.
Oh! by the blood of King Edward,
Oh! by the blood of King Edward,
It was a swapping, swapping MALLARD.


But whoever would possess themselves of the true history
of the swapping mallard of All-Souls, must read the
       Complete Vindication of the Mallard of All-Souls,        published
in 1751, by Dr. Buckler, sub-warden,        a most
[Pg 93]
incontrovertible proof of his wit,        who for that and other,
his effusions, was usually styled, by way of eminence, says
Chalmers, in his History of Oxford,        The Buckler of the
Mallardians.        His Vindication, it is justly observed, is
       one of the finest pieces of irony in our language.        Of
course, he is highly indignant at the        injurious suggestions
of Mr. Pointer (contained in the foregoing quotations,)
who insinuates, that the huge mallard was no better than
a goose-a-gander,        magis senex,             c.; and after citing
the very words of Mr. P., he breaks out,        Thus the mallard
of All-Souls, whose REMEMBRANCE has, for these three
centuries, been held in the highest veneration, is, by this
forged hypothesis, degraded into a GOOSE, or, at least,
ranked in the same class with that ridiculous animal, and
the whole story on which the rites and ceremonies of the
mallard depends, is represented as merely traditional;
more than a hint is given of the mischievousness of the
bird, whatever he be; and all is founded on a pretended
longevity, in support of which fiction the great names of
Lord Bacon and Mr. Willughby are called in, to make the
vilifying insinuation pass the more plausibly upon the
world.               We live in an age (he adds,) when the most
serious subjects are treated with an air of ridicule; I shall
therefore set this important affair in its true light, and
produce authorities        sufficient to convince the most obstinate
incredulity; and first, I shall beg leave to transcribe
a passage from Thomas Walsingham, (see Nicholson       s
Historical Library,) a monk of St. Alban       s, and Regius
Professor of History in that monastery, about the year
1440. This writer is well known among the historians
for his Historia Brevis, written in Latin, and published
both by Camden and Archbishop Parker. But the tract I
am quoting is in English, and entitled, Of Wonderful
and Surprising Eventys, and, as far as I can find, has
never yet been printed. The eighth chapter of his fifth
book begins thus:       

              Ryghte well worthie of Note is thilke famous Tale of
the All-Soulen Mallarde, the whiche, because it bin acted
in our Daies, and of a suretye vouched into me, I will in
fewe Wordys relate.

[Pg 94]
              Whereas Henrye Chicele, the late renowned Arch-Bishope
of Cantorburye, had minded to founden a Collidge
in Oxenforde for the hele of his Soule and the Soules of
all those who peryshed in the Warres in Fraunce, fighteing
valiantlye under our most gracious Henrye the fifthe,
moche was he distraughten concerning the Place he myghte
choose for thilke Purpose. Him thynketh some whylest
how he myghte place it withouten the eastern Parte of the
Citie, both for the Pleasauntnesse of the Meadowes and
the clere Streamys therebye runninge. Agen him thynketh
odir whylest howe he mote builden it on the Northe
Side for the heleful Ayre there coming from the fieldis.
Now while he doubteth thereon he dreamt, and behold
there appearyth unto him one of righte godelye Personage,
saying and adviseing him as howe he myghte placen his
Collidge in the Highe Strete of the Citie, nere unto the
Chirche of our blessed Ladie the Virgine, and in Witnesse
that it was sowthe and no vain and deceitful Phantasie,
wolled him to laye the first Stone of the foundation at the
corner which turnyth towards the Cattys-strete, where in
delvinge he myghte of a Suretye finde a schwoppinge Mallarde
imprison       d in the Sinke or Sewere, wele yfattened
and almost ybosten. Sure Token of the Thrivaunce of
his future Collidge.

              Moche doubteth he when he awoke on the nature of
this Vision, whether he mote give hede thereto or not.
Then advisyth he thereon with monie Docters and learned
Clerkys, all sayd howe he oughte to maken Trial upon it.
Then comyth he to Oxenforde, and on a Daye fix       d, after
Masse seyde, proceedeth he in solemn wyse, with Spades
and Pickaxes for the nonce provided, to the Place afore
spoken of. But long they had not digged ere they herde,
as it myghte seme, within the wam of the Erthe, horrid
Strugglinges and Flutteringes, and anon violent Quaakinges
of the distressyd Mallarde. Then Chicele lyfteth up
his hondes and seyth Benedicite,      c.      c. Nowe when
they broughte him forthe behold the Size of his Bodie was
as that of a Bustarde or an Ostriche, and moche wonder
was thereat, for the lyke had not been been scene in this
Londe, ne in anie odir.       

[Pg 95]
       Here,        says the Doctor,        we have the matter of fact
proved from an authentic record, wherein there is not one
word said of the longevity of the mallard, upon a supposition
of which Mr. Pointer has founded his whole libel.
The mallard,        tis true, has grown to a great size. But
what then? Will not the richness and plenty of the diet
he wallowed in very well account for this, without supposing
any great number of years of imprisonment? The
words of the historian, I am sure, rather discourage any
such supposition. Sure token, says he, of the thrivance of
his future college! which seems to me to intimate the great
progress the mallard had made in fattening, in a short
space of time. But be this as it will, there is not the least
hint of a goose in the case. No: the impartial Walsingham
had far higher notions of the mallard, and could form
no comparison of him, without borrowing his idea from
some of the most noble birds, the bustard and the ostridge.       
Turning to our author       s comment on the last
passage of Mr. Pointer, he adds,        However, this is certain,
this mallard is the accidental occasion of a great
gaudy once a year, and great mirth; for on this occasion
is always sung a merry old song.                     Rem tam seriam       tam
negligenter,        exclaims the Doctor;        Would any one
but this author have represented so august a ceremony as
the Celebration of the Mallard by those vulgar circumstances
of eating and drinking, and singing a merry old
song? Doth he not know that the greatest states, even
those of Rome and Carthage, had their infant foundations
distinguished by incidents very much resembling those of
the mallard, and that the commemoration of them was
celebrated with hymns and processions, and made a part
of their religious observances? Let me refresh his memory
with a circumstance or two relating to the head of Tolus
(will serve to elucidate the fourth line of the second verse
of the merry old song) which was discovered at the foundation
of the Capitol. The Romans held the remembrance
of it in the greatest veneration, as will appear from the
following quotation from Arnobius, in a fragment preserved
by Lipsius:              Quo die (says he, speaking of the annual
celebrity) congregati sacerdotes, et eorum ministri, totum
[Pg 96]
Capitolinum collem circumibant, cantilenam quandam sacram
de Toli cujusdam capite, dum molirentur fundamenta
invento, recitantes deinde ad c      nam ver         pontificiam se
recipientes,             c. Part of this merry old song (as Mr. P.
would call it) is preserved by Vossius, in his book De Sacris
Cantilenis Veterum Romanorum. The chorus of it
shows so much the simplicity of the ancient Roman poetry
that I cannot forbear transcribing it for the benefit of my
reader, as the book is too scarce to be in every one       s hand.
It runs thus:


Toli caput venerandum!
Magnum caput et mirandum!
Toli caput resonamus.


I make no doubt but that every true critic will be highly
pleased with it. For my own part, it gives me a particular
pleasure to reflect on the resemblance there is between this
precious relique of antiquity, and the chorus of the Mallard.


Oh, by the blood of King Edward,
It was a swapping, swapping Mallard!


The greatness of the subject, you see, is the Thing celebrated
in both, and the manner of doing it is as nearly
equal as the different geniuses of the two languages will
permit. Let me hope, therefore, that Mr. P. when he
exercises his thoughts again on this subject, will learn to
think more highly of the mallard, than of a common gaudy,
or merry making. For it will not be just to suppose that
the gentlemen of All-Souls can have less regard for the
memory of so noble a bird, found all alive, than the Romans
had for the dead skull of the Lord knows whom.       



ANOTHER OXFORD DREAM PRECEDED THE FOUNDATION OF ST. JOHN       S COLLEGE.

Dr. Plott relates, in his History of Oxfordshire, that the founder of
St. John       s College, Oxford, Sir Thomas White, alderman and merchant
tailor of London, originally designed the establishment of his college
at his birth-place, Reading, in Berkshire. But being warned in a
[Pg 97]
dream, that he should build a college for the education of youth, in
religion and learning, near a place where he should find two elms
growing out of the same root, he first proceeded to Cambridge, and
finding no such tree, he repaired to Oxford, where he discovered one,
which answered the description in his dream, near St. Bernard       s
College. Elated with joy, he dismounted from his horse, and, on his
knees, returned thanks for the fortunate issue of his pious search.
Dr. Joseph Warton seems to throw a doubt upon Dr. Plott       s narration,
observing, that he was fond of the marvellous. The college was
founded in the middle of the sixteenth century, and Doctor Plott says,
that the tree was in a flourishing state in his day, 1677, when Dr.
Leving was president of St. John       s College. Mr. Pointer observes, in
his Oxoniensis Academia,        The triple trees that occasioned the
foundation of the college,      c. did stand between the library and
the garden. One of them died in 1626.       

The following letter, addressed to the Society by Sir
Thomas, the founder, a fortnight before his death, the 11th
of February, 1566, is a relic worth printing, though it does
       savour of death       s heads.       


       Mr. President, with the Fellows and Schollers.


       I have mee recommended unto you even from the bottome
of my hearte, desyringe the Holye Ghoste may be
amonge you untill the end of the worlde, and desyringe
Almightie God, that everie one of you may love one another
as brethren; and I shall desyre you all to applye to
your learninge, and so doinge, God shall give you his blessinge
bothe in this worlde and the worlde to come. And,
furthermore, if anye variance or strife doe arise amonge
you, I shall desyre you, for God       s love, to pacifye it as
much as you may; and that doinge, I put no doubt but
God shall blesse everye one of you. And this shall be the
last letter that ever I shall sende unto you; and therefore
I shall desyre everye one of you, to take a copy of yt for
my sake. No more to you at this tyme; but the Lord
have you in his keeping until the end of the worlde.
Written the 27th day of January, 1566. I desyre you all
[Pg 98]
to pray to God for mee, that I may ende my life with
patience, and that he may take mee to his mercye.

       By mee,
       Sir Thomas White,                     
       Knighte, Alderman of London, and                              
       Founder of St. John       s College, in Oxford.       




A POINT OF PRECEDENCE SETTLED.

A dispute once arose between the Doctors of Law and
Medicine, in Cambridge, as to which had the right of precedence.
       Does the thief or hangman take precedence
at executions?        asked the Chancellor, on reference to his
judgment.        The former,        answered a wag.        Then let
the Doctors of Law have precedence,        said the Chancellor.



COMPLIMENTS TO THE LEARNED OF BOTH UNIVERSITIES.

       The names which learned men bear for any length of time,        says Dr.
Parr,        are generally well founded.        Dr. Chillingworth, for his able
and convincing writings in support of the Protestant Church, was
styled

       MALLEUS PAPISTARUM.       

Dr. Sutherland, the friend and literary associate of Dr.
Mead, and others, obtained the soubriquet of

       THE WALKING DICTIONARY.       

John Duns, better known as the celebrated Duns Scotus,
who was bred at Merton College, Oxford, and is said to
have been buried alive, was called

DOCTOR SUBTILIS;

Another Mertonian, named Occam, his successor and opponent, was named

DOCTOR INVINCIBILIS;


[Pg 99]
A third was the famous Sir Henry Savile, who had the title of

PROFOUND

Bestowed upon him: and a fourth of the Society of Merton College, was
the celebrated Reformer, John Wickliffe, who was called

DOCTOR EVANGELICUS.

Wood, says, that Dr. John Reynolds, President of Corpus Christi
College, Oxford, died in 1607,        one of so prodigious a memory, that
he might have been called

THE WALKING LIBRARY;       

To        see whom,        he adds,        was to command virtue itself.        If Duns Scotus
was justly called        the most subtle doctor,        says Parr, Roger Bacon,

       THE WONDERFUL,       

Bonaventure        the Seraphim,        Aquinas the        Universal and Evangelical,       
surely Hooker has with equal, if not superior justice, obtained the
name of

       THE JUDICIOUS.       

Bishop Louth, in his preface to his English Grammar, has bestowed the
highest praise upon the purity of Hooker       s style. Bishop Warburton, in
his book on the Alliance between Church and State, often quotes him,
and calls him,        the excellent, the admirable, the best good man of our
order.       



JOHN LELAND,

Senior, says Wood, who in the reigns of Henry V. and VI. taught and read
in Peckwaters Ynne, while it flourished with grammarians,        was one so well
seen in verse and prose, and all sorts of humanity, that he went beyond
[Pg 100]
the learnedest of his age, and was so noted a grammarian, that this
verse was made upon him:       


       Ut rosa flos florum sic Leland grammaticorum;       


Which,        he adds,        with some alteration, was fastened upon John Leland,
junior, by Richard Croke, of Cambridge, at what time the said Leland
became a Protestant, and thereupon,        observes Wood (as if it were a
necessary consequence,)        fell mad:       


       Ut rosa flos florum sic Leland flos fatuorum.       


Which being replied to by Leland (In Encom. Eruditorum
in Anglia,      c. per Jo. Leland       s edit. Lond. 1589,) was
answered by a friend of Croke       s in verse also. And here
by the way I must let the reader know that it was the
fashion of that age (temp. Hen. VIII.) to buffoon, or wit
it after that fashion, not only by the younger sort of students,
but by bishops and grave doctors. The learned
Walter Haddon, Master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and
afterwards President of Magdalen College, Oxford, in an
epistle that he wrote to Dr. Cox, Almoner to Edward IV.
(afterwards Bishop of Ely)        doth give him great commendations
of his actions and employments, and further
addeth (in his Lucubrations) that when he was at leisure
to recreate his mind, he would, rather than be idle,        Scevol       
et L       lii more       aut velitationem illam Croci cum
Lelando perridiculam, vel reliquas Oxonienses nugas (ita
enim profecto sunt,        saith he,)        evolvere voluerit,      c.       
Dr. Tresham, also, who was many years Commissary or
Vice-Chancellor of the University, is said by (Humfredus
in Vita Juelli)        ludere in re seria,      c.               When Queen
Elizabeth was asked her opinion of the scholarship of the
two great cotemporaries, the learned Buchanan and Dr.
Walter Haddon, the latter accounted the best writer of
Latin of his age, she dexterously avoided the imputation
of partiality by replying:        Buchannum omnibus antepono,
Haddonum nemini postpono.       



LORD MOUNTJOY

Was the friend and cotemporary of Erasmus, at Queen       s
[Pg 101]
College, Cambridge, and was so highly esteemed by that
great man, that he called him,        Inter doctos nobilissimus,
inter nobiles doctissimus, inter utrosque optimus.        His
noble friend once entreated him to


ATTACK THE ERRORS OF LUTHER.

       My Lord,        replied the sage,        nothing is more easy than to say Luther
is mistaken: nothing more difficult than to prove him so.       


VIR EGREGIE DOCTUS,

Was the soubriquet conferred upon the celebrated Etonian,
Cantab, Reformer, Provost of King       s College, and Bishop
of Hereford, Dr. Edward Fox, by the learned Bishop Godwin.
Another Etonian and Cantab, Dr. Aldrich, Bishop
of Carlisle, received from Erasmus, when young, the
equally just and elegant compliment of


       BLAND        ELOQUENTI        JUVENEM.       



A POINT OF ETIQUETTE.

Many humorous stories are told of the absurd height to
which the observance of etiquette has been carried at both
Oxford and Cambridge. In my time, you might meet a
good fellow at a wine party, crack your joke with him,
hob-nob,      c., but, unless introduced, you would have been
stared at with the most vacant wonderment if you attempted
to recognise him next day. It is told of men of both
universities, that a scholar walking on the banks of the
Isis, or Cam, fell into the river, and was in the act of
drowning, when another son of Alma-Mater came up, and
observing his perilous situation, exclaimed,        What a pity
it is I have not the honour of knowing the gentleman, that
I might save him!        One version of the story runs, that
the said scholars met by accident on the banks of the Nile
or Ganges, I forget which, when the catastrophe took place;
we may, therefore, very easily imagine the presence of
either a crocodile or an alligator to complete the group.

[Pg 102]
Wood, in his Annals of Oxford, has the following anecdote of


THE VALUE OF A SYLLABLE.

       The masters of olden time at Athens, and afterwards
at Oxford, were called Sophi, and the scholars Sophist       ;
but the masters taking it in scorn that the scholars should
have a larger name than they, called themselves Philosophi,       that
is, lovers of science, and so got the advantage
of the scholars by one syllable.        Every body has heard of
Foote       s celebrated motto for a tailor friend of his, about
to sport his coat of arms,              List, list, O list!        But every
body has not heard, probably, though it is noticed in his
memoir, extant in Nichols       s Literary Anecdotes, that the
learned Cambridge divine and antiquary, Dr. Cocks Macro,
having applied to a Cambridge acquaintance for an appropriate
motto to his coat of arms, was pithily answered with


       COCKS MAY CROW.       

Every Cantab remembers and regrets the early death of
the accomplished scholar, Charles Skinner Matthews, M.
A., late Fellow of Downing College, who was        the familiar       
of the present Sir J. C. Hobhouse, and of the late
Lord Byron. He was not more accomplished than facetious,
nor, according to one of Lord Byron       s letters, more
facetious than        beloved.        Speaking of his university
freaks, his lordship says,        when Sir Henry Smith was
expelled from Cambridge, for a row with a tradesman
named        Hiron,        Matthews solaced himself with shouting
under Hiron       s window every evening       


       Ah me! what perils do environ
The man who meddles with hot Hiron!       


He was also of that


BAND OF PROFANE SCOFFERS

who, under the auspices of               , used to rouse Lord
Mansel (late Bishop of Bristol) from his slumbers in the
Lodge of Trinity (College;) and when he appeared at the
[Pg 103]
window, foaming with wrath, and crying out,        I know you,
gentlemen; I know you!        were wont to reply,        We beseech
thee to hear us, good Lort!       Good Lort deliver us!       
(Lort was his Christian name.) And his lordship might
have added, the pun was the more poignant, as the Bishop
was either a Welshman himself, or had a Welsh sponsor,
in the person of the late Greek Professor, Dr. Lort. Punning
upon sacred subjects, however, is decidedly in bad
taste; yet, in the reign of the Stuarts, neither king nor
nobles were above it. Our illustrious Cantab, Bacon,
writing to Prince, afterwards Charles the First, in the
midst of his disastrous poverty, says, he hopes,        as the
father was his Creator, the son will be his Redeemer.       
Yet this great man


DID NOT THE LESS REVERENCE RELIGION,

But said, towards the close of his chequered life, that        a little
smattering in philosophy would lead a man to Atheism, but a thorough
insight into it will lead a man back to a First Cause; and that the
first principle of religion is right reason; and seriously professed,
all his studies and inquisitions, he durst not die with any other
thoughts than those religion taught, as it is professed among the
Christians.        These incidents remind me that


THE MEMORY OF JEMMY GORDON,


       Who, to save from rustication,
Crammed the dunce with declamation,       


Is now fast falling into forgetfulness, though there was a
time when he was hailed by Granta       s choicest spirits, as
one who never failed to        set the table in a roar.        Poor
Jemmy! I shall never forget the manner in which he, by
one of those straightforward, not-to-be-mistaken flashes of
wit, silenced a brow-beating Radical Huntingdon attorney,
at a Reform-meeting in Cambridge market-pace. Jemmy
was a native of Cambridge, and was the son of a former
chapel-clerk of Trinity College, who gave him an excellent
classical education, and had him articled to an eminent
solicitor, with fine talents and good prospects. But though
Jemmy was        a cunning man with a hard head,        such as
[Pg 104]
his profession required, he had a soft heart,       fell in love
with a pretty girl. That pretty girl, it is said, returned
his passion, then proved faithless, and finally coquetted
and ran off with a        gay deceiver,        a fellow-commoner of
Trinity College,       optically dazzled, no doubt, with the
purple robe and silver lace, for Jemmy was a fine, sensible-looking
man. Poor Jemmy! he was too good for the faithless
hussy; he took it to heart, as they say, and, unfortunately,
took to drinking at the same time. He soon became
too unsettled, both in mind and habits, to follow up his
profession with advantage, and he became a bon-vivant, a
professed wit, with a natural turn for facete, and the cram-man
of the more idle sons of Granta, who delighted in his
society in those days when his wits were unclouded, nor
did the more distinguished members of the university then
disdain to hail him to their boards. For many years Jemmy
lived to know and prove that        learning is most excellent;       
and having a good classical turn, he lived by writing
Themes and Declarations for non-reading Cantabs, for
each of which Jemmy expected the physician       s mite, and,
like them, might be said to thrive by the Guinea Trade.
It is, no doubt, true, that some of his productions had college
prizes awarded to them, and that, on one occasion,
being recommended to apply for the medal, he indignantly
answered,        It is no credit to be first in an ass-race!       
Notwithstanding, Jemmy       s in-goings never equalled his
out-goings, and many a parley had Jemmy with his empty
purse. It was no uncommon thing for him to pass his
vacations in quod       videlicet jail       for debts his creditors
were well aware he could not pay; but they well knew
also that his friends, the students, would be sure to pay
him out on their return to college. These circumstances
give occasion for the publication of the now scarce caricatures
of him, entitled,        Term-time,        and        Non-term.       
In the first he is represented spouting to one of his togaed
customers, in the latter he appears cogitating in        durance
vile.        Besides these, numerous portraits of Jemmy have
been put forth, for the correctness of most of which we,
who have        held our sides at his fair words,        can vouch.
A full-length is extant in Hone       s Every-Day Book, in the
[Pg 105]
Gradus ad Catabrigiam is a second; and we doubt not but
our friend Mason, of Church-Passage, Cambridge, could
furnish a collector with several. Poor Jemmy! he has
now been dead several years. His latter days were melancholy
indeed. To the last, however, Jemmy continued
to sport those distinctive marks of a man of ton, a spying-glass
and an opera-hat, which so well became him. Latterly
he became troublesome to his best friends, not only
levying contributions at will, but by saying hard things to
them, sparing neither heads of college, tutors, fellows, students,
or others whose names were familiar to him. On
one occasion, oblivious with too much devotion to Sir
John, as was latterly his wont, his abuse caused him to be
committed to the tread-mill       sic transit       and after his
term of exercise had expired, meeting a Cantab in the
street whose beauty was even less remarkable than his wit,
he addressed our recreant with,        Well, Jemmy, how do
you like the tread-mill?               I don       t like your                ugly
face,        was the response. Jemmy       s recorded witticisms
were at one time as numberless as the stars, and in the
mouth of every son of Granta, bachelor or big-wig; now
some only are remembered. He one day met Sir John
Mortlock in the streets of Granta, soon after he had been
knighted; making a dead pause, and looking Sir John full
in the face, Jemmy improvised       


       The king, by merely laying sword on,
Could make a knight of Jemmy Gordon.       


At another time, petitioning a certain college dignitary for
a few shillings to recover his clothes, pledged to appease
his thirst, he said, on receiving the amount,        Now, I know
that my redeemer liveth.       

Jemmy, in his glorious days, had been a good deal patronised
by the late Master of Trinity College, Bishop
Mansel, like himself a wit of the first water. Jemmy one
day called upon the bishop, during the time he filled the
office of Vice-Chancellor, to beg half-a-crown.        I will
give you as much,        said the Bishop,        if you can bring me
a greater rogue than yourself.        Jemmy made his bow and
departed, content with the condition, and had scarcely half
crossed the great court of Trinity, when he espied the late
[Pg 106]
Mr. B., then one of the Esquire Bedels of the University,
scarcely less eccentric than himself. Jemmy coolly told
him that the Vice-Chancellor wanted to see him. Into the
Lodge went our Bedel, followed close by Jemmy.        Here
he is,        said Jemmy, as they entered the Bishop       s presence,
arcades ambo, at the same instant.        Who?        inquired the
Bishop.        You told me, my Lord,        said Jemmy,        to bring
you a greater rogue than myself, and you would give me
half-a-crown, and here he is.        The Bishop enjoyed the
joke, and gave him the money. A somewhat


SIMILAR STORY IS TOLD OF AN OXFORD WAG,

In Addison       s Anecdotes, stating, that about the beginning
of the eighteenth century, when it was more the fashion
to drink ale at Oxford than at present, a humorous fellow
of merry memory established an ale-house near the pound,
and wrote over his door,        Ale sold by the pound!        As
his ale was as good as his jokes, the Oxonians resorted to
his house in great numbers, and sometimes stayed there
beyond the college hours. This was made a matter of
complaint to the Vice-Chancellor, who was desired to take
away his license by one of the Proctors. Boniface was
summoned to attend accordingly, and when he came into
the Vice-Chancellor       s presence, he began hawking and
spitting about the room. This the Vice-Chancellor observed,
and asked what he meant by it?        Please your
worship,        said he,        I came here on purpose to clear myself.       
The Vice-Chancellor imagining that he actually
weighed his ale, said,        They tell me you sell ale by the
pound; is that true?               No, an        please your worship.       
       How do you, then?               Very well, I thank you, sir,       
said the wag,        how do you do?        The Vice-Chancellor
laughed and said,        Get away for a rogue; I       ll say no more
to you.        The fellow went out, but in crossing the quod
met the proctor who had laid the information against him.
       Sir,        said he, addressing the Proctor,        the Vice-Chancellor
wants to speak with you,        and they went to the Vice-Chancellor       s
together.        Here he is, sir,        said Boniface,
as they entered the presence.        Who?        inquired the Vice.
       Why, sir,        he rejoined,        you sent me for a rogue, and
[Pg 107]
I have brought you the greatest that I know of.        The
result was, says the author of Terr       -Filius (who gives a
somewhat different version of the anecdote,) that Boniface
paid dear for his jokes: being not only deprived of his
license, but committed to prison.



CAMBRIDGE FROLICS.

I recollect once being invited, with another Cantab, to
bitch (as they say) with a scholar of Bene       t Coll. and arrived
there at the hour named to find the door sported and
our host out. We resolved, however, not to be floored by
a quiz, and having gained admission to his rooms per the
window, we put a bold face upon matters, went straight
to the buttery, and ordered        coffee and muffins for two,       
in his name. They came of course; and having feasted
to our heart       s content, we finished our revenge by hunting
up all the tallow we could lay hands on, which we cut up
to increase the number, and therewith illuminated his
rooms and beat a retreat as quick as possible. The College
was soon in an uproar to learn the cause for such a
display, and we had the pleasure of witnessing our wag       s
chagrin thereat from a nook in the court. This anecdote
reminds me of one told of himself and the late learned
physician, Dr. Battie, by Dr. Morell. They were contemporary
at Eton, and afterwards went to King       s College,
Cambridge, together. Dr. Battie       s mother was his jackall
wherever he went, and, says Dr. Morell, she kindly recommended
me and other scholars to a chandler at 4s. 6d.
per dozen. But the candles proved dear even at that rate,
and we resolved to vent our disappointment upon her son.
We, accordingly, got access to Battie       s room, locked him
out, and all the candles we could find in his box we lighted
and stuck up round the room! and, whilst I thrummed on
the spinnet, the rest danced round me in their shirts. Upon
Battie       s coming, and finding what we were at, he        fell to
storming and swearing,        says the Doctor,        till the old
Vice-Provost, Dr. Willymott, called out from above,        Who is
[Pg 108]


SWEARING LIKE A COMMON SOLDIER?       

       It is I,        quoth Battle.        Visit me,        quoth the Vice-Provost.
Which, indeed, we were all obliged to do the next morning,
with a distich, according to custom. Mine naturally
turned upon,        So fiddled Orpheus, and so danced the
brutes;        which having explained to the Vice-Provost, he
punished me and Sleech with a few lines from the Epsilon
of Homer, and Battie with the whole third book of Milton,
to get, as we say, by heart.        Another College scene, in
which Battie played a part, when a scholar at King       s, is
the following:       


CASE OF BLACK RASH,

Given on the authority of his old college chum, Ralph
Thicknesse, who, like himself, became a Fellow. There
was then at King       s College, says Ralph, a very good-tempered
six-feet-high Parson, of the name of Harry Lofft,
who was one of the College chanters, and the constant butt
of all both at commons and in the parlour. Harry, says
Ralph, dreaded so much the sight of a gun or a pair of
pistols, that such of his friends as did not desire too much
of his company kept fire-arms to keep him at arm       s length.
Ralph was encouraged, by some of the Fellows, he says
(juniors of course,) to make a serious joke out of Harry       s
foible, and one day discharged a gun, loaded with powder,
at our six-feet-high Parson, as he was striding his way to
prayers. The powder was coarse and damp and did not
all burn, so that a portion of it lodged in Harry       s face.
The fright and a little inflammation put the poor chanter
to bed, says Ralph. But he was not the only frightened
party, for we were all much alarmed lest the report should
reach the Vice-Chancellor       s ears, and the good-tempered
Hal was prevailed with to be only ill. Battie and another,
who were not of the shooting party (the only two fellow-students
in physic,) were called to Hal       s assistance. They
were not told the real state of the case, and finding his
pulse high, his spirits low, and his face inflamed and sprinkled
with red spots, after a serious consultation they prescribed.
On retiring from the sick man       s room, they were
[Pg 109]
forthwith examined on the state of the case by the impatient
plotters of the wicked deed, to whose amusement
both the disciples of Galen pronounced Hal       s case to be
the black rash! This, adds Ralph, was a never-to-be-forgotten
roast for Battie and Banks in Cambridge; and if
we may add to this, that Battie, in after life, sent his wife
to Bath for a dropsy, where she was shortly tapped of a
fine boy, it may give us a little insight into the practice of
physic, and induce us to say with the poet       


       Better to search in fields for wealth unbought,
Than fee the doctor for a nauseous draught.       


The same Ralph relates a humorous anecdote of


THE FATE OF THE DOCTOR       S OLD GRIZZLE WIG.

The Doctor, says Ralph, was as good a punch as he was
a physician, and after he settled at Uxbridge, in the latter
character, where he first opened his medical budget, with
the proceeds of his Fellowship at King       s College alone to
depend on, Ralph took advantage of a stay in London to
ride over to see his old college chum and fellow-punster,
and reached his domus in the Doctor       s absence. Ralph       s
wig was the worse for a shower of rain he had rode through,
and, taking it off, desired the Doctor       s man, William, to
bring him his master       s old grizzle to put on, whilst he dried
and put a dust of powder into his. But ere this could be
accomplished, the Doctor returned, as fine as may be, in
his best tye, kept especially for visiting his patients in.
As soon as mutual greetings had passed,        Why, zounds,
Ralph,        exclaimed the Doctor,        what a cursed wig you
have got on!               True,        said Ralph, taking it off as he
spoke,        it is a bad one, and if you will, as I have another
with me, I will toss it into the fire.               By all means,       
said the Doctor,        for, in truth, it is a very caxon,        and
into the fire went the fry. The Doctor now began to skin
his legs, and calling his man, William,        Here,        said he,
taking off his tye,        bring me my old wig.               Mr. Thicknesse
has got it, said William.        And where is it, Ralph,       
said the Doctor, turning upon his visiter.        Burnt, as you
desired; and this illustrates the spirit of all mankind,       
[Pg 110]
said Ralph;        we can see the shabby wig, and feel the pitiful
tricks of our friends, overlooking the disorder of our
own wardrobes. As Horace says,        Nil habeo quod agam;                     mind
every body       s business but your own.               Talking
of gunpowder reminds me of


TWO OTHER SHOOTING ANECDOTES.

All who know anything of either Oxford or Cambridge
scholars, know well enough, that their manners are not
only well preserved at all seasons, but that when they are
in a humour for sporting, it is of very little consequence
whether other folk preserve their manners or not. When
the late eccentric Joshua Waterhouse, B. D. (who was so
barbarously murdered a few years since by Joshua Slade,
in Huntingdonshire,) was a student of Catherine Hall,
Cambridge, of which he became a Fellow, he was a remarkably
strong young man, some six feet high, and not
easily frightened. He one day went out to shoot with
another man of his college, and his favourite dog, Sancho,
had just made his first point, when a keeper came up and
told Joshua to take himself off, in no very classic English.
Joshua therefore declined compliance. Upon this our
keeper began to threaten. Joshua thereupon laid his gun
aside, and coolly began taking off his coat (or, as the fancy
would say, to peel,) observing,        I came out for a day       s
sport, and a day       s sport I       ll have.        Upon which our
keeper shot off, leaving Joshua in possession of the field,
from which he used to boast he carried off a full bag. At
another time


A PARTY OF OXONIANS,

Gamesomely inclined, were driving, tandem, for the neighbourhood
of Woodstock, when passing a stingy old cur,
yclept a country gentleman, who had treated some one of
the party a shabby trick, a thought struck them that now
was the hour for revenge. They drove in bang up style
to the front of the old man       s mansion, and coolly told the
servant, that they had just seen his master, who had desired
them to say, that he was to serve them up a good
dinner and wine, and in the meantime show them where
[Pg 111]
the most game was to be found. This was done, and after
a roaring day       s sport, and a full gorge of roast, baked and
boiled, washed down with the best ale, port and sherry,
the old boy       s cellar could furnish, they made Brazen-nose
College, Oxon, 8, p.m., much delighted with the result,
and luckily the affair went no further, at the time at least.




BISHOP WATSON       S OWN ACCOUNT OF HIS PROGRESS AT CAMBRIDGE.

       Soon after the death of my father,        says this learned
prelate, in his Autobiography, published in 1816,        I was
sent to the university, and admitted a sizer of Trinity
College, Cambridge, on the 3d of November, 1754. I did
not know a single person in the university, except my
tutor, Mr. Backhouse, who had been my father       s scholar,
and Mr. Preston, who had been my own school-fellow. I
commenced my academic studies with great eagerness,
from knowing that my future fortune was to be wholly of
my own fabricating, being certain that the slender portion
which my father had left to me (300l.) would be barely
sufficient to carry me through my education. I had no
expectations from relations; indeed I had not a relative so
near as a first cousin in the world, except my mother, and
a brother and sister, who were many years older than me.
My mother       s maiden name was Newton; she was a very
charitable and good woman, and I am indebted to her (I
mention it with filial piety) for imbuing my young mind
with principles of religion, which have never forsaken me.
Erasmus, in his little treatise, entitled Antibarbarorum,
says, that the safety of states depend upon three things, a
proper or improper education of the prince, upon public
preachers, and upon school-masters; and he might with
equal reason have added, upon mothers; for the code of
the mother precedes that of the school-master, and may
stamp upon the rasa tabula of the infant mind, characters
of virtue and religion which no time can efface. Perceiving
that the sizers were not so respectfully looked upon
by the pensioners and scholars of the house as they ought
[Pg 112]
to have been, inasmuch as the most learned and leading
men of the university have even arisen from that order
(Magister Artis ingenique largitor venter,) I offered myself
for a scholarship a year before the usual time of the
sizers sitting, and succeeded on the 2nd of May, 1757.
This step increased my expenses in college, but it was
attended with a great advantage. It was the occasion of
my being particularly noticed by Dr. Smith, the master of
the college. He was, from the examination he gave me,
so well satisfied with the progress I had made in my studies,
that out of the sixteen who were elected scholars, he
appointed me to a particular one (Lady Jermyn       s) then
vacant, and in his own disposal; not, he said to me, as
being better than other scholarships, but as a mark of his
approbation; he recommended Saunderson       s Fluxions,
then just published, and some other mathematical books,
to my perusal, and gave, in a word, a spur to my industry,
and wings to my ambition. I had, at the time of my being
elected a scholar, been resident in college two years and
seven months, without having gone out of it for a single
day. During that period I had acquired some knowledge
of Hebrew, greatly improved myself in Greek and Latin,
made considerable progress in mathematics and natural
philosophy, and studied with much attention Locke       s
works, King       s book on the Origin of Evil, Puffendorf       s
Treatise De Officio Hominis et Civis, and some other books
on similar subjects; I thought myself, therefore, entitled
to some little relaxation. Under this persuasion I set forward,
May 30, 1757, to pay my elder and only brother a
visit at Kendal. He was the first curate of the New Chapel
there, to the structure of which he had subscribed liberally.
He was a man of lively parts, but being thrown
into a situation where there was no great room for the display
of his talents, and much temptation to convivial festivity,
he spent his fortune, injured his constitution, and
died when I was about the age of thirty-three, leaving a
considerable debt, all of which I paid immediately, though
it took almost my all to do it. My mind did not much
relish the country, at least it did not relish the life I led in
that country town; the constant reflection that I was
[Pg 113]
idling away my time mixed itself with every amusement,
and poisoned all the pleasures I had promised myself from
the visit; I therefore took a hasty resolution of shortening
it, and returned to college in the beginning of September,
with a determined purpose to make my Alma Mater the
mother of my fortunes. That, I well remember, was the
expression I used to myself, as soon as I saw the turrets
of King       s College Chapel, as I was jogging on a jaded nag
between Huntingdon and Cambridge. I was then only a
Junior Soph; yet two of my acquaintances, the year below
me, thought that I knew so much more of mathematics than
they did, that they importuned me to become their private
tutor. I undoubtedly wished to have had my time to myself,
especially till I had taken my degree; but the narrowness
of my circumstances, accompanied with a disposition
to improve, or, more properly speaking, with a desire
to appear respectable, induced me to comply with their
request. From that period, for above thirty years of my
life, and as long as my health lasted, a considerable portion
of my time was spent in instructing others without much
instructing myself, or in presiding at disputations in philosophy
or theology, from which, after a certain time, I
derived little intellectual improvement. Whilst I was an
under-graduate, I kept a great deal of what is called the
best company       that is, of idle fellow-commoners, and
other persons of fortune       but their manners never subdued
my prudence; I had strong ambition to be distinguished,
and was sensible that wealth might plead some
excuse for idleness, extravagance and folly in others; the
want of wealth could plead more for me. When I used
to be returning to my room at one or two in the morning,
after spending a jolly evening, I often observed a light in
the chamber of one of the same standing with myself; this
never failed to excite my jealousy, and the next day was
always a day of hard study. I have gone without my dinner
a hundred times on such occasions. I thought I never
entirely understood a proposition in any part of mathematics
or natural philosophy, till I was able, in a solitary
walk, obstipo capite atque ex porrecto labello, to draw the
scheme in my head, and go through every step of the
[Pg 114]
demonstration without book, or pen and paper. I found this
was a very difficult task, especially in some of the perplexed
schemes and long demonstrations of the twelfth
Book of Euclid, and in L       H       pital       s Conic Sections, and in
Newton       s Principia. My walks for this purpose were so
frequent, that my tutor, not knowing what I was about,
once reproved me for being a lounger. I never gave up a
difficult point in a demonstration till I had made it out
proprio marte; I have been stopped at a single step for
three days. This perseverance in accomplishing whatever
I undertook, was, during the whole of my active life,
a striking feature in my character. But though I stuck
close to abstract studies, I did not neglect other things; I
every week imposed upon myself a task of composing a
theme or declamation in Latin or English. I generally
studied mathematics in the morning, and classics in the
afternoon; and used to get by heart such parts of orations,
either in Latin or Greek, as particularly pleased me. Demosthenes
was the orator, Tacitus the historian, and Persius
the satirist whom I most admired. I have mentioned
this mode of study, not as thinking there was any thing
extraordinary in it, since there were many under-graduates
then, and have always been many in the University of
Cambridge, and, for aught I know, in Oxford, too, who
have taken greater pains. But I mention it because I feel
a complacence in the recollections of days long since happily
spent, hoc est vivere bis vita posse priori frui, and
indulge in a hope, that the perusal of what I have written
may chance to drive away the spirit of indolence and dissipation
from young men; especially from those who enter
the world with slender means, as I did. In January, 1759,
I took my Bachelor of Arts        degree. The taking of this
first degree is a great era in academic life; it is that to
which all the under-graduates of talent and diligence direct
their attention. There is no seminary of learning in Europe
in which youth are more zealous to excel during the
first years of their education than in the University of
Cambridge. I was the second wrangler of my year. In
September, 1759, I sat for a Fellowship. At that time
there never had been an instance of a Fellow being elected
[Pg 115]
from among the junior Bachelors. The Master told me
this as an apology for my not being elected, and bade me
be contented till the next year. On the 1st of October,
1760, I was elected a Fellow of Trinity College, and put
over the head of two of my seniors of the same year, who
were, however, elected the next year. The old Master,
whose memory I have ever revered, when he had done
examining me, paid me this compliment, which was from
him a great one:              You have done your duty to the College;
it remains for the College to do theirs to you.        I
was elected the next day, and became assistant tutor to
Mr. Backhouse in the following November.        Every body
knows his subsequent career embraced his appointment to
the several dignified University offices of Tutor, Moderator,
Professor of Chemistry, and Regius Professor of
Divinity, and that he died Bishop of Llandaff. I may
here, as an apposite tail piece, add from Meadley       s Life
of that celebrated scholar and divine,


PALEY       S SKETCH OF HIS EARLY ACADEMICAL LIFE.

In the year 1795, during one of his visits to Cambridge,
Dr. Paley, in the course of a conversation on the subject,
gave the following account of the early part of his own
academical life; and it is here given on the authority and
in the very words of a gentleman who was present at the
time, as a striking instance of the peculiar frankness with
which he was in the habit of relating adventures of his
youth.        I spent the two first years of my under-graduateship
(said he) happily, but unprofitably. I was constantly
in society where we were not immoral, but idle
and rather expensive. At the commencement of my third
year, however, after having left the usual party at rather
a late hour in the evening, I was awakened at five in the
morning by one of my companions, who stood at my bedside
and said,        Paley, I have been thinking what a d       d
fool you are. I could do nothing, probably, were I to try,
and can afford the life I lead: you can do every thing, and
cannot afford it. I have had no sleep during the whole
night on account of these reflections, and am now come
solemnly to inform you, that, if you persist in your
[Pg 116]
indolence, I must renounce your society.        I was so struck
(continued Paley) with the visit and the visiter, that I lay
in bed great part of the day and formed my plan: I ordered
my bed-maker to prepare my fire every evening, in
order that it might be lighted by myself; I rose at five,
read during the whole of the day, except such hours as
chapel and hall required, allotting each portion of time its
peculiar branch of study; and, just before the closing of
gates (nine o       clock) I went to a neighbouring coffee-house,
where I constantly regaled upon a mutton-chop and a dose
of milk punch: and thus on taking my bachelor       s degree,
I became senior wrangler.        He, too, filled the trustworthy
and dignified office of Tutor of his College, and deserved,
though he did not die in possession of, a bishopric.



THE LOUNGER. BY AN OXONIAN.


I rise about nine, get to breakfast by ten,
Blow a tune on my flute, or perhaps make a pen;
Read a play till eleven, or cock my laced hat;
Then step to my neighbours, till dinner, to chat.
Dinner over, to Tom       s, or to James       s I go,
The news of the town so impatient to know,
While Law, Locke and Newton, and all the rum race,
That talk of their nodes, their ellipses, and space,
The seat of the soul, and new systems on high,
In holes, as abstruse as their mysteries, lie.
From the coffee-house then I to Tennis away,
And at five I post back to my College to pray:
I sup before eight, and secure from all duns,
Undauntedly march to the Mitre or Tuns;
Where in punch or good claret my sorrows I drown,
And toss off a bowl        To the best in the town:       
At one in the morning I call what       s to pay,
Then home to my College I stagger away;
Thus I tope all the night, as I trifle all day.





AN OXFORD HOAX AND A PURITAN DETECTED.

A certain Oxford D.D. at the head of a college, lately
expected a party of maiden ladies, his sisters and others,
to visit him from the country. They were strangers in
[Pg 117]
Oxford, therefore, like another Bayard, he was anxious to
meet them on their arrival and gallant them to his College.
This, however, was to him, so little accustomed to do the
polite to the ladies, an absolute event, and it naturally
formed his prime topic of conversation for a month previously.
This provoked some of the Fellows of his College
to put a hoax upon him, the most forward in which
was one Mr. H              , a puritan forsooth. Accordingly, a
note was concocted and sent to the Doctor, in the name of
the ladies, announcing, that they had arrived at the Inn
in Oxford.        The Inn!        exclaimed the Doctor, on perusing
it;        Good God! how am I to know the Inn?       
However, after due preparation, off he set, in full canonicals,
hunting for his belles and the Inn! The Star, Mitre,
Angel, all were searched; at last, the Doctor, both tired
and irritated, began to smell a rat! The idea of a hoax
flashed upon his mind; he hurried to his lodgings, at his
College, where the whole truth flashed upon him like a
new light, and the window of his room being open, which
overlooked the Fellows        garden, he saw a group of them
rubbing their hands in high glee, and the ringleader, Mr.
H              , in the midst: he was so roused at the sight, that,
leaning from the window, he burst out with              H              !
you puritanical son of a bitch!        It is needless to add,
that the words, acting like a charm, quickly dissolved their
council: but the Doctor, too amiable to remember what
was not meant as an affront, himself afterwards both joined
in and enjoyed the laugh created by the joke.



MORE THAN ONE GOOD SAYING

Is attributed to the non-juring divine, celebrated son of
Oxon, and excellent English historian, Thomas Carte, who,
falling under the suspicions of the Government, as a favourer
of the Pretender, was imprisoned at the time the
Habeas Corpus Act was suspended, in 1744. Whilst
under examination by the Privy Council, the celebrated
Duke of Newcastle, then minister, asked him,        If he were
not a bishop?               No, my Lord Duke,        replied Carte,
[Pg 118]
       there are no bishops in England, but what are made by
your Grace; and I am sure I have no reason to expect that
honour.        Walking, soon after he was liberated, in the
streets of London, during a heavy shower of rain, he was
plied with,        A coach, your reverence?               No, honest
friend,        was his answer,        this is not a reign for me to
ride in.       



HORACE WALPOLE A SAINT.

Cole says, in his Athen        Cant., that Horace Walpole
latterly lived and died a Sceptic; but when a student at
King       s College, Cambridge, he was of        a religious enthusiastic
turn of mind, and used to go with Ashton (the late
Dr., Master of Jesus College,) his then great friend, to
pray with the prisoners in the castle.        Dyer gives the
following poetical version of


A CAMBRIDGE CONUNDRUM,

In his Supplement, on Doctors Long, Short, and Askew:       


What       s Doctor, and Dr., and Doctor writ so?
Doctor Long, Doctor Short, and Doctor Askew.




A BISHOP       S INTEREST.

Bishop Porteus said of himself, when holding the See of Chester, that
he        had not interest enough to command a Cheshire cheese.       



OXFORD FAMOUS FOR ITS SOPHISTS.

       For sophistry, such as you may call corrupt and vain,       
says Wood, in the first volume of his Annals,        which we
had derived from the Parisians, Oxford hath in ancient
time been very famous, especially when many thousands
of students were in her, equalling, if not exceeding, that
university from whence they had it; a token of which, with
its evil consequences, did lately remain,       I mean the
[Pg 119]
quadragesimall exercises, which were seldom performed, or at
least finished without the help of Mars. In the reign of
Henry the Third, and before, the schools were much polluted
with it, and became so notorious, that it corrupted
other arts; and so would it afterwards have continued,
had it not been corrected by public authority for the present,
though in following times it increased much again,
that it could not be rooted out. Some there were that
wrote, others that preached against it, demonstrating the
evil consequences thereof, and the sad end of those that
delighted in it. Jacobus Januensis reports that one Mr.
Silo, a Master of the University of Paris, and Professor of
Logic, had a scholar there, with whom he was very familiar:
and being excellent in the art of sophistry, spared
not all occasions, whether festival or other day, to study
it. This sophister being sick, and almost brought to
death       s door, Master Silo earnestly desired him, that after
his death he would return to him and give him information
concerning his state, and how it fared with him. The
sophister dying, returned according to promise, with his
hood stuffed with notes of sophistry, and the inside lined
with flaming fire, telling him, that that was the reward
which he had bestowed upon him for the renown he had
before for sophistry; but Mr. Silo esteeming it a small
punishment, stretched out his hand towards him, on which
a drop or spark of the said fire falling, was very soon
pierced through with terrible pain; which accident the
defunct or ghost beholding, told Silo, that he need not
wonder at that small matter, for he was burning in that
manner all over. Is it so? (saith Silo) well, well, I know
what I have to do. Whereupon, resolving to leave the
world, and enter himself into religion, called his scholars
about him, took his leave of, and dismissed them with
these metres:       


       Linquo coax[3] ranis, cras[4] corvis, vanaque[5] vanis,
Ad Logicam pergo, que mortis non timet[6] ergo.       



[3]
Luxuriam scil. luxuriosis, vel potius rixas sophistis.

[4]
Avaritiam scil. avaris.

[5]
Superbiam pomposis.

[6]
Religionem ubi bene viventi non timetur stimulus mortis.

[Pg 120]
Which said story coming to the knowledge of certain Oxonians,
about the year 1173 (as an obscure note which I
have seen tells me,) it fell out, that as one of them was
answering for his degree in his school, which he had hired,
the opponent dealt so maliciously with him, that he stood
up and spake before the auditory thus:        Profect        , profect        ,
     c.               Truly, truly, sir sophister, if you proceed thus, I
protest before this assembly I will not answer; pray, sir,
remember Mr. Silo       s scholar at Paris,              intimating thereby,
that if he did not cease from vain babblings, purgatory,
or a greater punishment, should be his end. Had such
examples been often tendered to them (adds Wood, with
real bowels of compassion,) as they were to the Parisians,
especially that which happened to one Simon Churney, or
Thurney, or Tourney (Fuller says, Thurway, a Cornish
man,) an English Theologist there (who was suddenly
struck dumb, because he vainly gloried that he, in his disputations,
could be equally for or against the Divine truth,)
it might have worked more on their affections; but this
being a single relation, it could not long be wondered at.       
After these logical marvels, Anthony gives us the following
instance of


A VICE-CHANCELLOR       S BEING LACONIC.

       Dr. Prideaux, when he resigned the office of Vice-Chancellor, 22nd
July, 1626 (which is never done without an oration spoken from the
chair in the convocation, containing for the most part an account of
the acts done in the time of their magistrateship,) spoke only the
aforesaid metres,        Linquo coax,             c., supposing there was more matter
in them than the best speech he could make, frustrating thereby the
great hopes of the Academicians of an eloquent oration.       

       Oxford hath been so famous for sophistry, and hath used such a
particular way in the reading and learning it,        adds Wood, in treating
of the schools,        that it hath often been styled       


       SOPHISTRIA SECUNDUM USUM OXON.       

So famous, also, for subtlety of logicians, that no place
[Pg 121]
hath excelled it.        This great subtlety, however, would seem, in a degree,
to have departed from our sister of Oxford in 1532, when, they say,


TWO PERT OXONIANS

Took a journey to Cambridge, and challenged any to dispute
with them there, in the public schools, on the two
following questions:              An jus Civile sit Medicina pr       stantius?       
In English as much as to say, Which does
most execution, Civil Law or Medicine?       a nice point,
truly. But the other formed the subject of serious argumentation,
and ran thus:              An mulier condemnata, bis
ruptis loqueis, sit tertio suspendenda?        Ridley, the Bishop
and martyr, then a young man, student or Fellow of Pembroke
Hall, Cambridge, is said to have been one of the
opponents on this interesting occasion, and administered
the flagell        lingu        with such happy effect to one of these
pert pretenders to logic lore, that the other durst not set
his wit upon him. The Oxford sophistry had so much


CORRUPTED THE LATIN TONGUE

There, says Wood, that the purity thereof being lost among the
scholars,        their speaking became barbarous, and derived so constantly
to their successors, that barbarous speaking of Latin was commonly
styled by many

       Oxoniensis loquenti mos.       

The Latin of the schools, in the present day, is none of
the purest at either University. A certain Cambridge
Divine, a Professor, who was a senior wrangler, and is
justly celebrated for his learning and great ability, one
day presiding at an act in Arts, upon a dog straying into
the school, and putting in for a share of the logic with a
howl at the audience, the Moderator exclaimed,        Verte
canem ex.        There have, however, been fine displays of
pure Latinity in the schools of both; and it appears


THE OXONIANS SURPASSED ARISTOTLE

At a very early period, not only in the art of logic itself,
[Pg 122]
but in their manner of applying it: for in the beginning of
1517, says Wood, about the latter end of Lent (a fatal
time for the most part to the Oxonians,) a sore discord fell
out between the Cistercian and Benedictine monks, concerning
several philosophical points discussed by them in
the schools. But their arguments being at length flung
aside, they decided the controversy by blows, which, with
sore scandal, continued a considerable time. At length
the Benedictines rallying up what forces they could procure,
they beset the Cistercians, and by force of arms made
them fly and betake themselves to their hostels. In fact,
he says, by the use of logic, and the trivial arts, the Oxford
sophists, in the time of Lent, broke the king       s peace, so
that the University privileges were several times suspended,
and in danger of being lessened or taken away.
Through the corrupt use of it,        the Parva Logicalia, and
other minute matters of Aristotle, many things of that
noble author have been so changed from their original, by
the screwing in and adding many impertinent things, that
Tho. Nashe (in his book,        Have at you to Saffron Walden,       )
hath verily thought, that if Aristotle had risen out
of his grave, and disputed with the sophisters, they would
not only have baffled him with their sophistry, but with his
own logic, which they had disguised, and he composed
without any impurity or corruption. It may well be said,
that in this day they have done no more than what Tom
Nashe       s beloved Dick Harvey did afterwards at Cambridge,
that is to say,


HE SET ARISTOTLE WITH HIS HEELS UPWARDS ON THE SCHOOL GATES,

With ass       s ears on his head,       a thing that Tom would        in
perpetuam rei memoriam,        record and never have done
with. Wilson, in his Memorabilia Cantabrigi       , says of
this said Tom Nash, that he was educated at St. John       s
College, Cambridge, where he resided seven years, was
at the fatal repast of the pickled herrings with the poet
Green, and, in 1597, was either confined or otherwise
troubled for a comedy on the Isle of Dogs (extant in the
MSS. of Oldys,) though he wrote but the first act, and
[Pg 123]
the players without his knowledge supplied the rest. He
was a man of humour, a bitter satirist, and no contemptible
poet; and more effectually discouraged and non-plused
the notorious anti-prelate and astrologer, Will Harvey,
and his adherents, than all the serious writers that attacked
them. There is a good character of him, says Oldys, in
The return from Parnassus, or Scourge of Simony, which
was publicly acted by the students of St. John       s, in 1606,
wherein


THEY FIRST EXEMPLIFIED THE ART OF CUTTING,

An elegant term, that is in equal request at the sister university,
as well as amongst the coxcombs of the day, adds
Wilson, though the members of St. John       s are celebrated
for the origin of the term        to cut,              i. e.        to look an old
friend in the face, and affect not to know him,        which is
the cut direct. Those who would be more deeply read in
this art, which has been greatly improved since the days
in which it originated, will find it at large in the Gradus
ad Cantabrigiam.



CROMWELL       S SOLDIERS AT A DISPUTATION AT OXFORD.

It was a custom of Dr. Kettel, while President of Trinity
College, Oxford (says Tom Warton, citing the MSS. of
Dr. Bathurst, in his Appendix to his Life of Sir Thomas
Pope,)        to attend daily the DISPUTATIONS in the college-hall,
on which occasions he constantly wore a large black
furred muff. Before him stood an hour-glass, brought by
himself into the hall, and placed on the table, for ascertaining
the time of the continuance of the exercise, which
was to last an hour at least. One morning, after Cromwell       s
soldiers had taken possession of Oxford, a halberdier
rushed into the hall during this controversy, and plucking
off our venerable Doctor       s muff, threw it in his face, and
then, with a stroke of his halberd, broke the hour-glass in
pieces. The Doctor, though old and infirm, instantly
seized the soldier by the collar, who was soon overpowered,
[Pg 124]
by the assistance of the disputants. The halberd was
carried out of the hall in triumph before the Doctor; but
the prisoner, with his halberd, was quickly rescued by a
party of soldiers, who stood at the bottom of the hall, and
had enjoyed the whole transaction.        It was in the grove
of this college, during Monmouth       s Rebellion of 1685, that
Sir Philip Bertie, a younger son of Robert Earl of Lindsay,
who was a member of Trinity College, and had
spoken a copy of verses in the theatre at Oxford, in 1683,
to the Duke and Dutchess a York,      c., trained a company,
chiefly of his own college, of which he was captain,
in the militia of the university.


TROOPS BEING RAISED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,

Says Warton, in Monmouth       s Rebellion. It reminds me
of a curious anecdote concerning Smith       s famous Ode, entitled
Pocockius, which I give from MSS., Cod. Balland,
vol. xix. Lit. 104:              The University raised a regiment for
the King       s service, and Christ Church and Jesus        Colleges
made one company, of which Lord Morris, since Earl of
Abingdon, was captain, who presented Mr. Urry (the
editor of Chaucer,) a corporal (serjeant) therein, with a
halberd. Upon Dr. Pocock       s death, Mr. Urry lugged
Captain Rag (Smith) into his chamber in Peckwater,
locked him in, put the key in his pocket, and ordered his
bed-maker to supply him with necessaries through the window,
and told him he should not come out till he made


A COPY OF VERSES ON THE DOCTOR       S DEATH.

The sentence being irreversible, the captain made the Ode,
and sent it, with his epistle, to Mr. Urry, who thereupon
had his release.               The epistle here mentioned,        adds
Tom,        is a ludicrous prose analysis of the Ode, beginning
Opusculum tuum, Halberdarie amplissime,             c., and is
printed in the fourth volume of Dr. Johnson       s English
Poets, who pronounces it unequalled by modern writers.
This same Oxonian, Smith, had obtained the soubriquet of


CAPTAIN RAG

[Pg 125]
By his negligence of dress. He was bred at Westminster
School, under Doctor Busby; and it is to be remembered,
for his honour,        that, when at the Westminster election
he stood a candidate for one of the universities, he so signally
distinguished himself by his conspicuous performances,
that there arose no small contention between the
representatives of Trinity College in Cambridge, and
Christ Church in Oxon, which of those two royal societies
should adopt him as their own. But the electors of Trinity
having a preference of choice that year, they resolutely
elected him; who yet, being invited the same time to
Christ Church, he chose to accept of a studentship there.       



THE THREE DAINTY MORSELS.

When our learned Oxonian, Dr. Johnson, was on his
tour in the Hebrides, accompanied by Bozzy, as Peter
Pindar has it, says an American writer, they had one day
travelled so far without refreshment, that the Doctor began
to growl in his best manner. Upon this Bozzy hastened
to a cottage at a distance, ordered a dinner, and was lucky
in obtaining the choice of a roast leg of mutton and the
Doctor       s favourite plum-pudding. Upon reaching the
house, the appetite of the latter drove him into the kitchen
to inspect progress, where he saw a boy basting the meat,
from whose head he conceited he saw something descend,
by the force of gravity, into the dripping-pan. The meat
was at length served up, and Bozzy attacked it with great
glee, exclaiming,        My dear Doctor, do let me help you to
some,       brown as a berry,       done to a turn.        The Doctor
said he would wait for the pudding, chuckling with equal
glee, whilst Bozzy nearly devoured the whole joint. The
pudding at length came, done to a turn too, which the
Doctor in his turn greedily devoured, without so much as
asking Bozzy to a bit. After he had wiped his mouth, and
begun to compose himself, Bozzy entreated to know what
he was giggling about whilst he eat the mutton? The
Doctor clapped his hands to both sides for support, as he
told him what he saw in the kitchen. Bozzy thereupon
[Pg 126]
begun to exhibit sundry qualms and queer faces, and calling
in the boy, exclaimed,        You rascal, why did you not
cover your dirty head with your cap when basting the
meat?                      Cause mother took it to boil the pudding in!       
said the urchin. The tables were turned. The Doctor
stared aghast, stamped, and literally roared, with a voice
of thunder, that if Bozzy ever named the circumstance to
any one, it should bring down upon him his eternal displeasure!
The following, not very dissimilar anecdote, is
told of a Cantab, who was once out hunting till his appetite
became as keen as the Doctor       s, and, like his, drove
him to the nearest cottage. The good dame spread before
him and his friend the contents of her larder, which she
described as        a meat pie, made of odds and ends, the
remnant of their own frugal meal.               Any thing is better
than nothing,        cried the half famished Cantab,        so let us
have it       ha, Bob.        Bob, who was another Cantab, his
companion, nodded assent. No sooner was the savoury
morsel placed before him, than he commenced operations,
and greedily swallowed mouthful after mouthful, exclaiming,
       Charming! I never tasted a more delicious morsel
in my life! But what have we here?        said he, as he sucked
something he held in both hands;        Fish, as well as
flesh, my good woman?               Fish!        cried the old dame, as
she turned from her washing to eye our sportsman,        why,
Lord bless ye, i        that bean       t our Billy       s comb!        The
effect was not a little ludicrous on our hungry Cantab,
whilst Bob       s        Haw! haw! haw!        might have been heard
from the Thames Tunnel to Nootka Sound.



ANSWERED IN KIND.

Why should we smother a good thing with mystifying
dashes, instead of plain English high-sounding names,
when the subject is of        honourable men?               Recte facta
refert.              Horace forbid it! The learned Chancery Barrister,
John Bell, K.C.,        the Great Bell of Lincoln,        as
he has been aptly called, was Senior Wrangler, on graduating
B.A., at Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1786, with
[Pg 127]
many able competitors for that honour. He is likewise
celebrated, as every body knows, for writing three several
hands; one only he himself can read, another nobody but
his clerk can read, and a third neither himself, clerk, nor
any body else can read! It was in the latter hand he one
day wrote to his legal contemporary and friend, the present
Sir Launcelot Shadwell, Vice-Chancellor of England
(who is likewise a Cantab, and graduated in 1800 at St.
John       s College, of which he became a Fellow, with the
double distinction of Seventh Wrangler and Second Chancellor       s
Medallist) inviting him to dinner. Sir Launcelot,
finding all his attempts to decipher the note about as vain
as the wise men found theirs to unravel the Cabalistic characters
of yore, took a sheet of paper, and having smeared
it over with ink, he folded and sealed it, and sent it as his
answer. The receipt of it staggered even the Great Bell
of Lincoln, and after breaking the seal, and eyeing and
turning it round and round, he hurried to Mr. Shadwell       s
chambers with it, declaring he could make nothing of it.
       Nor I of your note,        retorted Mr. S.        My dear fellow,       
exclaimed Mr. B., taking his own letter in his hand, is not
this, as plain as can be,        Dear Shadwell, I shall be glad
to see you at dinner to-day.               And is not this equally
as plain,        said Mr. S., pointing to his own paper,        My
dear Bell, I shall be happy to come and dine with you.       



POWERS OF DIGESTION.

In both Oxford and Cambridge the cooks are restricted
to a certain sum each term, beyond which the college will
not protect them in their demand upon the students. All
else are extras, and are included in        sizings        in Cambridge;
in Oxford the term is        to battel.        The head of a
college in the latter university, not long since, sent for
Mr. P              , one of his society, who had batteled much beyond
the allowance; and after Mr. P               had endeavoured
to excuse himself on the ground of appetite, turning to
the account, the Rector observed,        meat for breakfast,
meat for lunch, meat for dinner, meat for supper,        and
[Pg 128]
looking up in the face of the dismayed student, he exclaimed,
with his Welsh accent,        Christ Jesus! Mr. P              ,
what guts you must have.        This reminds me of


A CAMBRIDGE D.D.,

Now no more, who is said to have been a great gourmand,
and weighed something less than thirty stone, but not
much. At the college table, where our D.D. daily took
his meal, in order that he might the better put his hand
upon the dainty morsels, being very corpulent, he caused
a piece to be scooped out, to give him a fair chance. His
chair was also so placed, that his belly was three inches
from the table at sitting down, and when he had eaten till
he touched it, his custom was to lay down his knife and
fork and desist, lest, by eating too much, any dangerous
malady should ensue. A waggish Fellow of his college,
however, one day removed his chair double the distance
from the table, which the doctor not observing, began to
eat as usual. After taking more than his quantum, and
finding that he was still an inch or two from the goal, he
threw down his knife and fork in despair, exclaiming, he
       was sure he was going to die;        but having explained the
reason, he was relieved of his fears on hearing the joke
had been played him.



THE INSIDE PASSENGER.

Every Cantab of the nineteenth century must remember
our friend Smith of the Blue Boar, Trinity Street, charioteer
of that now defunct vehicle and pair which used to
ply between Cambridge, New-market, and Bury St. Edmunds,
and on account of its celerity, and other marked
qualities, was called        The Slow and Dirty        by Freshman,
Soph, Bachelor, and Big-wig, now metamorphosed into a
handsome four-in-hand, over which our friend Smith presides
in a style worthy of the Club itself! He had one
day, in olden time, pulled up at Botsham, midway between
Newmarket and Cambridge, when there happened to be
several Cantabs on the road, who were refreshing their
[Pg 129]
nags at the        self-same        inn, the Swan, at which the Slow
and Dirty made its daily halt.        Any passengers?        inquired
Smith.        One inside,        said a Cambridge wag,
standing by, whose eye was the moment caught by a young
ass feeding on the nettles in a neighbouring nook. Having
put his fellows up to the joke, Smith was invited in-doors
and treated with a glass of grog; meanwhile, my gentleman
with the long ears was popped inside the coach.
Smith coming out, inquired after his passenger, whom he
supposed one of his friends, the Cantabs, and learnt he
was housed.        All right,        said Smith, and off he drove,
followed quickly by our wag and party on horseback, who
determined to be in at the denouement. Smith had not
made much way, when our inside passenger, not finding
himself in clover, popped his head out at one of the coach
windows. The spectacle attracted the notice of many
bipeds as they passed along; Smith, however, notwithstanding
their laughter,        kept the even tenor of his way.       
At Barnwell the boys huzzaed with more than their usual
greetings, but still Smith kept on, unconscious of the
cause. He no sooner made Jesus        Lane, than crowds began
to follow in his wake, and he dashed into the Blue-Boar
yard with a tail more numerous than that upon the
shoulders of which Dan O       Connell rode into the first Reformed
Parliament, Feargus included. Down went the
reins, as the ostlers came to the head of his smoking prads,
and Smith was in a moment at the coach door, with one
hand instinctively upon the latch, and the other raised to
his hat, when the whole truth flashed upon his astonished
eyes, and Balaam was safely landed, amidst peals of
laughter, in which our friend Smith was not the least uproarious.



PALEY       S CELEBRATED SCHOOL ACT.

When Paley, in 1762, kept his act in the schools, previously
to his entering the senate-house, to contend for
mathematical honours, it was under the moderators, Dr.
John Jebb, the famous physician and advocate of reform in
[Pg 130]
church and state, and the learned Dr. Richard Watson,
late Bishop of Llandaff. Johnson       s Questiones Philosophic       
was the book then commonly resorted to in the
university for subjects usually disputed of in the schools;
and he fixed upon two questions, in addition to his mathematical
one, which to his knowledge had never before been
subjects of disputation. The one was against Capital
Punishments; the other against the Eternity of Hell Torments.
As soon, however, as it came to the knowledge of
the heads of the university that Paley had proposed such
questions to the moderators, knowing his abilities, though
young, lest it should give rise to a controversial spirit, the
master of his college, Dr. Thomas, was requested to interfere
and put a stop to the proceeding, which he did, and
Bishop Watson thus records the fact in his Autobiography:              Paley
had brought me, for one of the questions he
meant for his act,        ternitas p       narum contradicit Divinis
Attributis! The Eternity of Hell Torments contrary to
the Divine Attributes. I had accepted it. A few days
afterwards he came to me in a great fright, saying, that
the master of his college, Dr. Thomas, Dean of Ely, insisted
on his not keeping on such a question. I readily
permitted him to change it, and told him that, if it would
lessen his master       s apprehensions, he might put a        non       
before        contradicit;        making the question, The Eternity of
Hell Torments not contrary to the Divine Attributes: and
he did so.        In the following month of January he was
senior wrangler.


HE WAS NOT FOND OF CLASSICAL STUDIES,

And used to declare he could read no Latin author with
pleasure but Virgil: yet when the members        prize was
awarded to him for a Latin prose essay, in 1765, which he
had illustrated with English notes, he was, strange enough,
though his disregard of the classics was well known, suspected
of being the author of the Latin only. The reverse
was probably nearer the truth. It is notorious that


HE WAS NOT SKILLED IN PROSODY;

And when, in 1795, he proceeded to D.D., after being
[Pg 131]
made Sub-Dean of Lincoln, he, in the delivery of his Clerum,
pronounced prof      gus prof      gus, which gave some
Cambridge wag occasion to fire at him the following epigram:       


       Italiam fato profugus, Lavinaque venit
Litora; * * * * *
Errat Virgilius, forte profugus erat.       


He had


A SPICE OF CUTTING HUMOUR

In his composition, and some time after the Bishop of
Durham so honourably and unsolicited presented him to
the valuable living of Bishop Wearmouth, dining with his
lordship in company with an aged divine, the latter observed
in conversation,        that although he had been married
about forty years, he had never had the slightest difference
with his wife.        The prelate was pleased at so
rare an instance of connubial felicity, and was about to
compliment his guest thereon, when Paley, with an arch
       Quid?        observed,        Don       t you think it must have been
very flat, my Lord?       


A RULE OF HIS.

A writer, recording his on dits, in the New Monthly
Magazine, says, in Paley       s own words, he made it a rule
never to buy a book that he wanted to read but once. In
more than one respect,


HE WAS UNLIKE DR. PARR.

The latter had a great admiration for the canonical dress
of his order, and freely censured the practice of clergymen
not generally appearing in it. When on a visit to his
friend, the celebrated Mr. Roscoe, at that gentleman       s
residence near Liverpool, Parr used to ride through the
village in full costume, including his famous wig, to the
no small amusement of the rustics, and chagrin of his companion,
the present amiable and learned Thomas Roscoe,
originator and editor of        The Landscape Annual,             c.
[Pg 132]
Paley wore a white wig, and a coat cut in the close court
style: but could never be brought to patronise, at least in
the country, that becoming part of the dress of a dignitary
of the church, a cassock, which he used to call a black
apron, such as the master tailors wear in Durham.


HE WAS NEVER A GOOD HORSEMAN.

       When I followed my father,        he says,        on a pony of
my own, on my first journey to Cambridge, I fell off seven
times. My father, on hearing a thump, would turn his
head half aside, and say,        Take care of thy money, lad!              
This defect he never overcame: for when advanced in
years, he acknowledged he was still so bad a horseman,
       that if any man on horseback were to come near me when
I am riding,        he would say,        I should certainly have a
fall; company would take off my attention, and I have
need of all I can command to manage my horse, the quietest
creature that ever lived; one that, at Carlisle, used to
be covered with children from the ears to the tail.       


HIS TWO OR THREE REASONS FOR EXCHANGING LIVINGS.

Meadly, his biographer, relates, that when asked why
he had exchanged his living of Dalston for Stanwix? he
frankly replied,        Sir, I have two or three reasons for
taking Stanwix in exchange: first, it saved me double
housekeeping, as Stanwix was within twenty minutes       
walk of my house in Carlisle; secondly, it was 50l. a-year
more in value; and, thirdly, I began to find my stock of
sermons coming over again too fast.        He was


A DISCIPLE OF IZAAK WALTON,

And carried his passion for angling so far, that when Romney
took his portrait, he would be taken with a rod and
line in his hand.


HIS WAY WHEN HE WANTED TO WRITE.

       When residing at Carlisle,        he says,        if I wanted to write
any thing particularly well, I used to order a post-chaise,
[Pg 133]
and go to a quiet comfortable inn, at Longtown, where I was safe from
the trouble and bustle of a family, and there I remained until I had
finished what I was about.        In this he was


A CONTRAST TO DR. GOLDSMITH,

Who, when he meditated his incomparable poem of the
       Deserted Village,        went into the country, and took a
lodging at a farm-house, where he remained several weeks
in the enjoyment of rural ease and picturesque scenery,
but could make no progress in his work. At last he came
back to a lodging in Green-Arbour Court, opposite Newgate,
and there, in a comparatively short time, in the heart
of the metropolis, surrounded with all the antidotes to
ease, he completed his task       quam nullum ultra verbum.


PALEY       S DIFFICULTIES A USEFUL LESSON TO YOUTH.

Soon after he became senior wrangler, having no immediate
prospect of a fellowship, he became an assistant in a
school at Greenwich, where, he says, I pleased myself
with the imagination of the delightful task I was about to
undertake,        teaching the young idea how to shoot.        As
soon as I was seated, a little urchin came up to me and
began,              b-a-b, bab, b-l-e,
ble, babble!        Nevertheless, at this time, the height of his ambition was
to become the first assistant. During this period, he says, he restricted
himself for some time to the mere necessaries of life, in
order that he might be enabled to discharge a few debts,
which he had incautiously contracted at Cambridge.        My
difficulties,        he observes,        might afford a useful lesson to
youth of good principles; for my privations produced a
habit of economy which was of infinite service to me ever
after.        At this time I wanted a waistcoat, and went into
a second-hand clothes-shop. It so chanced that I bought
the very same garment that Lord Clive wore when he
made his triumphal entry into Calcutta.


IN HIS POVERTY HE WAS LIKE PARR.

The finances of the latter obliged him to leave Cambridge
[Pg 134]
without a degree; after he had been assistant at
Harrow, had a school at Stanmore, and been head master
of the grammar school at Colchester, and had become
head master of that of Norwich, they remained so low that
once looking upon a small library, says Mr. Field, in his
Life of the Doctor,        his eye was caught by the title,        Stephani
Thesaurus Lingu        Gr       c       ,        turning suddenly about,
and striking violently the arm of the person whom he addressed,
in a manner very unusual with him,        Ah! my
friend, my friend,        he exclaimed,        may you never be forced,
as I was at Norwich, to sell that work       to me so precious       from
absolute and urgent necessity!                      At one time
of my life,        he said,        I had but 14l. in the world. But
then, I had good spirits, and owed no man sixpence!       


PORSON, TOO, WAS A CONTRAST TO PALEY.

The first, it is well known, vacated his fellowship, and
left himself pennyless, rather than subscribe to the Thirty-nine
Articles, from which there is no doubt he conscientiously
dissented; and when asked to subscribe his belief
in the notorious Shakspeare forgery of the Irelands, his
reply was,        I subscribe to no articles of faith.        When
Paley was solicited to sign his name to the supplication of
the petitioning clergy, for relief from subscription, he has
the credit of replying, he        could not afford to keep a conscience,       
a saying that many have cherished to the prejudice
of that great man       s memory, but which it is more
than probable he said in his dry, humorous manner, without
suspicion it would be remembered at all, and merely
to rid himself of some importunate applicant. Paley, it is
well known, notwithstanding the conclusions to which
some interested writers have come, was strongly and conscientiously
attached to the doctrines and constitution of
the Established Church; and it was impossible but that,
with his fine common-sense perception, he must have been
well aware, that no Established Church, such as is that of
England, could long exist as such, if not fenced round by
articles of faith. And here I am reminded of an


ANECDOTE OF THE GREAT LORD BURLEIGH AND THE DISSENTERS OF HIS DAY.

He was once very much pressed by a body of Divines,
[Pg 135]
says Collins, in his Life, to make some alteration in the
Liturgy, upon which he desired them to go into the next
room by themselves, and bring in their unanimous opinion
on the disputed points. But they very soon returned without
being able to agree.        Why, gentlemen,        said he,
       how can you expect that I should alter my point in dispute,
when you, who must be more competent to judge,
from your situation, than I can possibly be, cannot agree
among yourselves in what manner you would have me
alter it.       


OTHER SAYINGS OF THIS GREAT MAN

Were, that he would        never truste anie man not of sounde religion; for
he that is false to God, can never be true to man.       

Parents, he said, were to be blamed for        the unthrifty looseness of
youth,        who made them men seven years too soon, and when they        had but
children       s judgments.       

       Warre is the curse, and peace the blessinge of a countrie;        and        a
realme,        he said,        gaineth more by one year       s peace, than by tenne
years        warre.       

       That nation,        he would observe,        was happye where the king would
take counsell and follow it.        With such a sage minister, it is not
surprising that Elizabeth was the greatest princess that ever lived,
nor that she gave such wise laws to Cambridge, whose Chancellor he
was.


PORSON       S PROGRESS IN KNOWLEDGE.

       When I was seventeen,        Porson once observed,        I
thought I knew every thing; as soon as I was twenty-four,
and had read Bentley, I found I knew nothing. Now I
have challenged the great scholars of the age to find five
faults to their one, in any work, ancient or modern, they
decline it.        On another occasion, he described himself as


A GENTLEMAN WITHOUT SIXPENCE IN HIS POCKET.

Person declining to enter into holy orders, as the statute
of his college required he should do, lost his fellowship at
Trinity, after he had enjoyed it ten years;        on which
[Pg 136]
heart-rending occasion,        says his friend and admirer, Dr.
Kidd,        he used to observe, with his usual good humour
(for nothing could depress him,) that he was a gentleman
living in London without a sixpence in his pocket.        Two
years afterwards his friends procured his election to the
Regius Professorship of Greek, on the death of Professor
Cooke, the sudden news of which event, he says, in a letter
printed in Parriana, addressed to the then Master of
Trinity, the learned Dr. Postlethwaite, all his ambition of
that sort having been long ago laid asleep,        put me in
mind of poor Jacob, who, having served seven years in
hope of being rewarded with Rachel, awoke, and behold
it was Leah.        He had seven years previously projected
a course of lectures in Greek, which most unaccountably
were not patronised by the Senate.



GREEK PROTESTANTS AT OXFORD.

Mr. Pointer says, in his Oxoniensis Academia,      c.,
speaking of the curiosities connected with Worcester College,
there were        Ruins of a Royal Palace, built by King
Henry the First, in Beaumont, near Gloucester-green,
upon some parts of which ruins, the late Dr. Woodroff
(when principal of Gloucester Hall, now Worcester College)
built lodgings for the education of young scholars
from Greece, who, after they had been here educated in
the reformed religion, were to be sent back to their own
country, in order to propagate the same there. And accordingly
some young Grecians were brought hither, and
wore their Grecian habits; but not finding suitable encouragement,
this project came to nothing.       



JUDGMENT OF ERASMUS ON THE CAMBRIDGE FOLK.

Fuller says, that Erasmus thus wrote of the Cambridge
folk, at the beginning of the sixteenth century.        Vulgus
Cantabrigiense, inhospitales Britannos antecedit, qui cum
summa rusticitate summum militiam conjunxere.        This
[Pg 137]
will by no means now apply to the better class of tradespeople,
and in no place that I know of is there more hospitality
amongst the higher orders of society. Kirk White,
in his Letters, is not very complimentary either to


BEDMAKERS OR GYPS.

The latter are called scouts in Oxford, and their office
borders on what is generally understood by the word valet.
The term Gyp is well applied from                         , a vulture, they
being, in the broadest sense of the word, addicted to prey,
and not over-scrupulous at both picking and stealing, in
spite of the Decalogue. I had one evening had a wine
party, during the warm season of the year; we drank freely,
and two of the party taking possession of my bed, I
contented myself with the sofa. About six in the morning
the Gyp came into the room to collect boots,      c. and
either not seeing me, or fancying I slept (the wine being
left on the table,) he very coolly filled himself a glass,
which he lost no time in raising to his lips, but ere he had
swallowed a drop, having watched his motions, I whistled
(significant of recognition,) and down went the wine, glass
and all, and out bolted our gyp, who actually blushed the
next time he saw me. Another anecdote touching lodging-house
keepers, I will head


DROPS OF BRANDY.

A certain mistress of a lodging-house, in Green-street,
Cambridge, where several students had rooms, having a
propensity, not for the ethereal charms of the music so
called, but for the invigorating liquor itself, had a habit,
with the assistance of what is called a screw-driver, but
which might more aptly be termed a screw-drawer, of
opening cupboard doors without resorting to the ordinary
use of a key. By this means she had one day abstracted
a bottle of brandy from the store of one of the students
(now a barrister of some practice and standing,) with
which, the better to consume it in undisturbed dignity, she
retired to the temple of the goddess Cloacina. She had
been missed for some time, and search was made, when
she was found half seas over, as they say, with the remnant
[Pg 138]
of the bottle still grasped in her hand, which she had plied
so often to her mouth, that she was unable to lift her hand
so high, or indeed to rise from her seditious posture. Upon
this scene a caricature of the first water was sketched, and
circulated by some Cambridge wag; another threw off the
following Epigrammatic Conun:


Why is my Dalia like a rose?
Perhaps, you       ll say, because her breath
Is sweeter than the flowers of earth:
No       odious thought       it is, her nose
Is redder than the reddest rose;
Which she has long been very handy
At colouring with drops of brandy.


Another head of a lodging-house is a notorious member of what in
Cambridge is called       


THE DIRTY-SHIRT CLUB.

This is a society that has existed in the town of Cambridge
for ages, whose functions consist in wearing the
linen of the students who lodge in their houses after it has
been cast off for the laundress. This same individual,
however, had a taste for higher game, and one of the students,
who had rooms in his house, being called to London
for a few days, returning rather unexpectedly, actually
found mine host at the head of the table, in his sitting-room,
surrounded by some twenty snobs, his friends. Our
gownsman very properly resented his impertinence, took
him by the collar and waist, and, in the language of that
fine old song, goose-a-goose-a-gander,        threw him down
stairs.        The rest of the party prudently followed at this
hint, leaving the table covered with the remains of sundry
bottles of wine and a rich dessert. Thus the affair terminated
at that time: but our gownsman being a man of
fortune, and one of those accustomed, therefore, to treat
his brother students, his friends, sumptuously too, went
two or three days after, to his fruiterer       s, to order


DESSERT FOR TWENTY.

       The same as you had on Wednesday?        inquired the fruiterer.
       On Wednesday!        he exclaimed with astonishment,              I
[Pg 139]
had no dessert on Wednesday!               Oh, yes, sir,        was the rejoinder,
       Mr.                himself ordered it for you, and, as I before said,
for twenty!        The whole matter was soon understood to be, that the
lodging-house keeper had actually done him the honour to give his
brother snobs, of the dirty shirt fraternity, an invite and
sumptuous entertainment at his expense! Of course, he did not remain
in the house of such a free-and-easy-gent. I name the fact as a
recent occurrence, and


A HINT FOR GOWNSMEN.

But this is not the only way in which they are fleeced: the
minor articles of grocery are easily appropriated: nay, not
only easily appropriated, but a duplicate order is occasionally
delivered for the benefit of the house. Some tradesmen
have made


MARVELLOUS STRIDES ON THE ROAD TO WEALTH,

From various causes. I remember one man who, in six
years, beginning life at the very beginning, saved enough
to retire upon an independence for the rest of his life.
Did he chalk double? I answer not. But students should
look to these things. At St. John       s College, Cambridge,
the tutors have adopted an excellent plan by which, with
ordinary diligence, cheats may be detected: they oblige
the tradesmen to furnish them with duplicates of their bills
against the students, one of which is handed to the latter,
and any error pointed out, they will be forced to rectify.


ANOTHER SPECIES OF FRAUD

Is a trick tradesmen have, in the Universities, of persuading
students to get into their debt, actually pressing their
wares upon them, and then, when their books show sufficient
reason, forsooth, they make a mock assignment of
their affairs over to their creditors, and some pettifogging
attorney addresses the unlucky debtors with an intimation,
that, unless the account is forthwith paid, together with
the expenses of the application, further proceedings will
be taken! though the wily tradesman has assured the
[Pg 140]
purchaser of his articles that credit would run to any length
he pleased: and so it does, and no longer. Such fellows
should be marked and cut! It is but justice to add,
however, that these observations do not apply to that respectable
class of tradesmen, of whom the student should
purchase his necessaries. The motto of every student,
notwithstanding, who is desirous of not injuring his future
prospects in life, by too profuse an expenditure, should be
       fugies Uticam,              keep out of debt!



THE SOURCE OF DR. PARR       S ELOQUENCE.

Some of Dr. Parr       s hearers, struck with a remarkable passage in his
sermon, asked him        Whether he had read it from his book?               Oh, no,       
said he,        it was the light of nature suddenly flashing upon me.        He
once called a clergyman a fool. The divine, indignant, threatened to
complain to the Bishop.        Do so,        was the reply,        and my Lord Bishop
will confirm you.       

To the same wit, when a student at Emanuel College, is attributed the
celebrated       


ADDRESS TO HIS TEA-CHEST,

       Tu doces,        (thou tea-chest!) Others give the paternity to Lord
Erskine, when a Fellow Commoner of Trinity College, Cambridge;
n       importe, they were friends.


AS A SPICE OF THEIR JOINT VANITY,

It is related of them, that one day, sipping their wine together, the
Doctor exclaimed,        Should you give me an opportunity, Erskine, I
promise myself the pleasure of writing your epitaph.               Sir,        was the
reply,        it       s a temptation to commit suicide.        On another occasion more
than one authority concur in the Doctor       s thus


ASSURING HIMSELF A PLACE AMONGST THE GREEK
SCHOLARS OF HIS DAY.

       Porson, sir, is the first, always the first; we all yield to
[Pg 141]
him. Burney is the third. Who is the second, I leave you to guess.       


ANOTHER SPICE OF HIS VANITY

Peeped out on his one night being seated in the side gallery
at the House of Commons, with the late Sir James
Mackintosh,      c., where he could see and be seen by the
members of the opposition, his friends. The debate was
one of great importance. Fox at length rose, and as he
proceeded in his address, the Doctor grew more and more
animated, till at length he rose as if with the intention of
speaking. He was reminded of the impropriety, and immediately
sat down. After Fox had concluded, he exclaimed:
       Had I followed any other profession, I might
have been sitting by the side of that illustrious statesman;
I should have had all his powers of argument,       all Erskine       s
eloquence,       and all Hargrave       s law.        He had one
day been arguing and disagreeing with a lady, who said,
       Well, Dr. Parr,


I STILL MAINTAIN MY OPINION.       

       Madam,        he rejoined,        you may, if you please, retain
your opinion: but you cannot maintain it.        Another lady
once opposing his opinions with more pertinacity than
cogency of reasoning, concluded with the observation,
       You know, Doctor,


IT IS THE PRIVILEGE OF WOMEN TO TALK NONSENSE.       

       No, madam,        he replied,        it is not their privilege, but
their infirmity. Ducks would walk, if they could, but
nature suffers them only to waddle.       

After some persons, at a party where the Doctor made
one, had expressed their regret that he had not written
more, or something more worthy of his fame, a young
scholar somewhat pertly called out to him,        Suppose, Dr.
Parr, you and I were to write a book together!               Young
man,        exclaimed the chafed lion,        if all were to be written
in that book which I do know, and which you do not know,
[Pg 142]
it would be a very large book indeed.        The following are
given by Field as his


REPROOFS OF IGNORANCE TALKING WITH THE
CONFIDENCE OF KNOWLEDGE.

He was once insisting on the importance of discipline,
established by a wise system, and enforced with a steady
hand, in schools, in colleges, in the navy, in the army;
when he was somewhat suddenly and rudely taken up by
a young officer who had just received his commission, and
was not a little proud of his        blushing honours.               What,
sir,        said he, addressing the Doctor,        do you mean to apply
that word discipline to the officers of the army? It
may be well enough for the privates.               Yes, sir, I do,       
replied the Doctor, sternly:        It is discipline makes the
scholar, it is discipline makes the soldier, it is discipline
makes the gentleman, and the want of discipline has made
you what you are.       


BEING MUCH ANNOYED

By the pert remarks of another tyro,              Sir,        said he,
       your tongue goes to work before your brain; and when
your brain does work, it generates nothing but error and
absurdity.        The maxim of men of experience, the Doctor
might have added, is,        to think twice before they act
once.        To a third person, of bold and forward but ill-supported
pretensions, he said,        B              , you have read
little, thought less, and know nothing.       


HE MATCHED A TRICK OF THE DEVIL.

Like the more celebrated scholars and divines, Clarke,
Paley, Markland,      c., he would join an evening party at
cards, always preferring the old English game of whist,
and resolutely adhering to his early determination of never
playing for more than a nominal stake. Being once, however,
induced to break through it, and play with the late
learned Bishop of Llandaff, Dr. Watson, for a shilling,
which he won, after pushing it carefully to the bottom of
his pocket and placing his hand upon it, with a kind of
[Pg 143]
mock solemnity, he said,        There, my lord Bishop, this is
a trick of the devil; but I       ll match him; so now, if you
please, we will play for a penny,        and this was ever after
the amount of his stake, though he was not the less ardent
in pursuit of success, or less joyous on winning his rubber.
Like our great moralist, Johnson, he had an aversion to
punning, saying, it exposed the poverty of a language.
Yet he perpetrated the following


THREE CLASSICAL PUNS:

One day reaching a book from a shelf in his library, two
others came tumbling down, including a volume of Hume,
upon which fell a critical work of Lambert Bos:        See
what has happened,        exclaimed the Doctor,        procumbit
humi bos.        At another time, too strong a current of air
being let into the room where he was sitting, suffering under
the effects of a slight cold,        Stop! stop!        said he,
       this is too much; at present I am only par levibus ventis.       
When he was solicited to subscribe to Dr. Busby       s
translation of Lucretius, published at a high price, he declined
doing so, by observing, at the proposed cost it
would indeed be        Lucretius carus.       


HIS LAW ACT AT CAMBRIDGE.

On proceeding to the degree of LL.D. at Cambridge, in
1781, Dr. Parr delivered        in the law schools, before
crowded audiences,        says Field,        two theses, of which
the subject of the first was, H       res ex delicto defuncti non
tenetur; and of the second, Jus interpretandi leges privatis,
perinde ac principi, constat. In the former of these,
after having offered a tribute of due respect to the memory
of the late Hon. Charles Yorke (the Lord Chancellor,)
he strenuously opposed the doctrine of that celebrated
lawyer, laid down in his book upon        the law of forfeiture;       
and denied the authority of those passages which were
quoted from the correspondence of Cicero and Brutus; because,
as he affirmed, after that learned and sagacious
(Cambridge) critic, Markland (in his Remarks on the
Epistles of those two Romans,) the correspondence itself
is not genuine. The same liberal and enlightened views
[Pg 144]
of the natural and social rights of man pervaded the latter
as well as the former thesis; and in both were displayed
such strength of reasoning and power of language, such
accurate knowledge of historical facts and such clear comprehension
of legal principles bearing on the questions,
that the whole audience listened with fixed and delighted
attention. The Professor of Law himself, Dr. Hallifax,
afterwards Bishop of St. Asaph, was so struck with the
uncommon excellence of these compositions, as to make it
his particular request that they should be given to the public;
but with which request Dr. Parr could not be persuaded
to comply.


       THERE IS A PLEASANT STORY

Reported of the Doctor,        says Barker, in his Parriana,
when on a visit to Dr. Farmer, at Emanuel Lodge. He
had made free in discourse with some of the Fellow Commoners
in the Combination-room, who, not being able to
cope with him, resolved to take vengeance in their own
way; they took his best wig, and thrust it into his boot:
this indispensable appendage of dress was soon called for,
but could nowhere be found, till the Doctor, preparing for
his departure, and proceeding, to put on his boots, found
one of them pre-occupied, and putting in his hand, drew
forth the wig, with a loud shout       perhaps                                     .       
       When the late Dr. Watson,        adds the same writer,        presided in
the divinity-schools, at


AN ACT KEPT BY DR. MILNER,

The reputation of whose great learning and ability caused
the place to be filled with the senior and junior members
of the University, one of the opponents was the late Dr.
Coulthurst, and the debate was carried on with great
vigour and spirit. When this opponent had gone through
his arguments, the Professor rose, as usual, from his throne,
and, taking off his cap, cried out       


       Arcades ambo
Et cantare pares, et respondere parati.       


We juniors, who happened to be present, were much
[Pg 145]
pleased with the application. Soon after, being in the
Doctor       s company, I mentioned how much we were entertained
with the whole scene, particularly with the close:
he smiled, and said,        It is Warburton       s,        where I soon
after found it.       



EPIGRAM

On a Cambridge beauty, daughter of an Alderman, made by the Rev. Hans
De Veil, son of Sir Thomas de Veil, and a Cantab:       


       Is Molly Fowle immortal?       No.
Yes, but she is       I       ll prove her so:
She       s fifteen now, and was, I know,
Fifteen full fifteen years ago.       




NOVEL REVENGE.

Sir John Heathcote, a Cantab, and lessee of Lincoln
church, being refused a renewal of the same on his own
terms, by the Prebend, Dr. Cobden, of St. John       s College,
Cambridge, upon accepting the Prebend       s terms, appointed
his late Majesty, then Prince of Wales, to be one of
the lives included in the lease, observing,        I will nominate
one for whom the dog shall be obliged to pray in the daytime,
wishing him dead at night.       



THEY TAKE THEM AS THEY COME.

A person might very well conclude, from the observations
of the enemies of our English Universities, that the
governors of them had the power of selecting the youth
who are to graduate at them, or that, of necessity, all men
bred at either Oxford or Cambridge ought to be alike distinguished
for superior virtue and forbearance, great learning,
and great talents. They forget, that they must take
them as they come, like the boy in the anecdote.        So you
[Pg 146]
are picking them out, my lad,        said a Cantab to a youth,
scratching his head in the street.        No,        said the arch-rogue,
       I takes        em as they come.        Just so do the authorities
at Oxford and Cambridge. I knew a son of
Granta, and eke, too,


THE DARLING SON OF HIS MOTHER,

Whose mind, at twenty, was a chaos, and must from his
birth have been, not as Locke would have supposed, a
sheet of white paper, ready to receive impressions, but one
smeared and useless. Yet Solomon in all his glory was
not half so wise as was this scion in his mother       s opinion.
She, therefore, brought him to Cambridge, and having introduced
him to the amiable tutor of St. John       s College,
smirkingly asked him,        If he thought her darling would
be senior wrangler?               I don       t know, madam,        was his
reply, in his short quick manner of speaking, pulling up a
certain portion of his dress, in the wearing of which he
resembled Sir Charles Wetherell,        I don       t know, madam;
that remains to be seen.        Poor fellow, he never could
get a degree, nor (after having been removed from Cambridge
to the Politechnique School at Paris, for a year or
two) could he ever get over the Pons Asinorum (as we
Cantabs term the fifth proposition of the first book of Euclid.)
Another


MISCALCULATING MAMMA,

And they are sure to miscalculate whenever they inter-meddle
with such matters, declined entering her two sons
at Cambridge in the same year, that, as she said,        They
might not stand in each other       s way.        Id est, they were
to be both senior wranglers. They, however, never caught
sight of the goal. I recollect, on one occasion, the second
son being floored in his college mathematical examination.
He was said to have afterwards carried home the paper
(containing twenty-two difficult geometrical and other
problems,) when one of his sisters snatched it out of his
hand, exclaiming,        Give it to me,        and, without the slightest
hesitation (in good Cambridge phrase,) she        floored       
[Pg 147]
the whole of them, to his dismay. This lady was one of
a bevy of ten beauties whom their mamma compassionately
brought to Cambridge to dance with the young gentlemen
of the University at her parties, and after so officiating for
some three or four years, notwithstanding they were all
Blues, and had corresponding names, from Britannia to
Boadicea, the Cantabs suffered them all to depart spinsters.
But Papas also sometimes overrate their sons        talents and
virtues. A gentleman, a few years since, on


PRESENTING HIS FAVOURITE SON

To the sub-rector of a certain College in Oxford, as a new
member, did so with the observation,        Sir, he is modest,
diffident, and clever, and will be an example to the whole
College.               I am glad of it,        was the reply, we want
such men, and I am honoured, sir, by your bringing him
here.        Papa made his exit, well pleased with our Welshman       s
hospitality, for of that country our Sub-Rector, as
well as the gentleman in question was. The former, too,
had been a chaplain in Lord Nelson       s fleet, in his younger
days, and was not over orthodox in his language, when
irritated, though a man with a better heart it would have
puzzled the Grecian sage to have traced out by candle-light.
A month had scarcely passed over, when Papa,
having occasion to pass through Oxon, called on the Sub-Rector,
of course, and naturally inquired,        How his son
demeaned himself?               You told me, sir,        said the Sub-Rector,
in a pet, and a speech such as the quarter-deck of
a man-of-war had schooled him in;        you told me, sir, that
your son was modest, but d       n his modesty! you told me,
sir, he was diffident, but d       n his diffidence! you told me,
sir, he was clever; he       s the greatest dunce of the whole
society! you told me, sir, he would prove an example to
the whole college: but I tell you, sir, that he is neither
modest, diffident nor clever, and in three weeks,        added
the Sub-Rector, raising his voice to a becoming pitch,        he
has ruined half the College by his example!        We can
scarcely do better than add to this, by way of tail-piece,
from that loyal Oxford scourge Terr        Filius (ed. 1726)       (to
be read,        cum grano,        and some allowance for the
excited character of the times in which it was written)       


[Pg 148]
ITER ACADEMICUM; OR, THE GENTLEMAN
COMMONER       S MATRICULATION.


Being of age to play the fool,
With muckle glee I left our school
At Hoxton;
And, mounted on an easy pad,
Rode with my mother and my dad
To Oxon.
Conceited of my parts and knowledge,
They entered me into a college
Ibidem.
The master took me first aside,
Showed me a scrawl       I read, and cried
Do Fidem.
Gravely he took me by the fist,
And wished me well       we next request
A tutor.
He recommends a staunch one, who
In Perkins        cause had been his Co-
Adjutor.
To see this precious stick of wood,
I went (for so they deemed it good)
In fear, Sir;
And found him swallowing loyalty,
Six deep his bumpers, which to me
Seemed queer, Sir.
He bade me sit and take my glass;
I answered, looking like an ass,
I can       t, Sir.
Not drink!       You don       t come here to pray!
The merry mortal said, by way
Of answer.
To pray, Sir! No, my lad;        tis well!
Come, here       s our friend Sacheverell;
Here       s Trappy!
Here       s Ormond! Marr! in short, so many
Traitors we drank, it made my crani-
um nappy.
And now, the company dismissed,
With this same sociable Priest,
Or Fellow,
I sallied forth to deck my back
With loads of stuff, and gown of black
Prunello.
My back equipt, it was not fair
My head should        scape, and so, as square
As chess-board,
A cap I bought, my scull to screen,
Of cloth without, and all within
Of paste-board.
[Pg 149]When metamorphosed in attire,
More like a parson than a squire
They       d dressed me.
I took my leave, with many a tear,
Of John, our man, and parents dear,
Who blest me.
The master said they might believe him,
So righteously (the Lord forgive him!)
He       d govern.
He       d show me the extremest love,
Provided that I did not prove
Too stubborn.
So far so good; but now fresh fees
Began (for so the custom is)
My ruin.
Fresh fees! with drink they knock you down;
You spoil your clothes, and your new gown
You sp        in.
I scarce had slept       at six       tan tin
The bell goes       servitor comes in       
Gives warning.
I wished the scoundrel at old Nick;
I puked, and went to prayers d       d sick
That morning.
One who could come half drunk to prayer
They saw was entered, and could swear
At random;
Would bind himself, as they had done,
To statutes, tho        he could not un-
derstand        em.
Built in the form of pigeon-pye,
A house[7] there is for rooks to lie
And roost in.
Their laws, their articles of grace,
Forty, I think, save half a brace,
Was willing
To swear to; swore, engaged my soul,
And paid the swearing broker whole
Ten shilling.
Full half a pound I paid him down,
To live in the most p       d town
O        th        nation:
May it ten thousand cost Lord Phyz,
For never forwarding his vis-
itation.

A STORY

Is told, and,        in the days that are gone,        is not at all
[Pg 150]
improbable, that a youth being brought to Oxon, after he had
paid the Tutor and other the several College and University
fees, was told he must subscribe to the Thirty-nine
Articles;        with all my heart,        said our freshman,        pray
how much is it?       



FRESHMEN OFTEN AFFORD MIRTH

To both tutors, scholars, scouts, gyps, and others, by their
blunders. They will not unfrequently, upon the first tingle
of the college bell (though it always rings a quarter of
an hour, by way of warning, on ordinary occasions, and
half an hour on saints        days, in Cambridge,) hurry off to
hall or chapel, with their gowns the wrong side outwards,
or, their caps reversed, walk unconsciously along with the
hind part before, as I once heard a soph observe,        the
peak smelling thunder.        They are also very apt to mistake
characters and functionaries:       I have seen a freshman
cap the college-butler, taking him for bursar at least.
The persons to be so complimented are the Chancellor,
the Vice-Chancellor, the Proctors, the head of your college,
and your tutors. When the late Bishop Mansell
was Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge, he one day met two
freshmen in Trumpington-street, who passed him unheeded.
The Bishop was not a man to        bate an iota of his due,
and stopped them and asked,        If they knew he was the
Vice-Chancellor?        They blushingly replied, they did not,
and begged his pardon for omitting to cap him, observing
they were freshmen.        How long have you been in Cambridge?       
asked the witty Bishop.        Only eight days,       
was the reply.        In that case I must excuse you; puppies
never see till they are nine days old.       



ANOTHER FRESHMAN

Was unconsciously walking beyond the University church,
on a Sunday morning, which (at both Oxford and Cambridge)
he would have been expected to attend, when he
[Pg 151]
was met by the Master of St. John       s College, Dr. Wood,
who, by way of a mild rebuke, stopped him and asked him,
       If the way he was going led to St. Mary       s Church?       
       Oh, no, sir,        said he, with most lamb-like innocence,
       this is the way,        pointing in the opposite direction.
       Keep straight on, you can       t miss it.        The Doctor, however,
having fully explained himself, preferred taking him
as a guide.



WE MUST DO SOMETHING FOR THE POOR LOST YOUNG MAN.

Lords Stowel and Eldon both studied at Trinity College,
Oxford, with success, and, it is well known, there
laid the foundation of that fame, which, from the humble
rank of the sons of a Newcastle coal-fitter, raised them
to the highest legal stations and the English peerage. The
former first graduated, and was elected a Fellow and Tutor
of All Soul       s College (where he had the late Lord
Tenterden for a pupil) and became Camden Professor.
The latter afterwards graduated with a success that would
have ensured him a fellowship and other University distinctions,
but visiting his native place soon after he took
A.B. he fell in love with Miss Surtees (the present Lady
Eldon) daughter of a then rich banker, in Newcastle, who
returned his affection, and they became man and wife.
Her family were indignant, and refused to be reconciled
to the young pair, because the lady had, as the phrase ran,
       married below her station.        Mr. Scott, the father, was
as much offended at the step his son had taken, which at
once shut him out from the chance of a fellowship, and
refused them his countenance. In this dilemma the new
married pair sought the friendship of Mr. William Scott
(now Lord Stowell) at Oxford. His heart, cast in a softer
mould, readily forgave them,       his amiable nature would
not have permitted him to do otherwise. He received
them with a brotherly affection, pitied rather than condemned
them, and is said to have observed to some Oxford
friends,        We must do something for the poor lost young
[Pg 152]
man!        What a lesson is there not read to mankind in the
result! A harsher course might have led to ruin       the
milder one was the stepping-stone to the woolsack and a
peerage.



LIKE O        WHISSONSET CHURCH.

A Cantab visited some friends in the neighbourhood of
Whissonset, near Fakenham, Norfolk, during the life of
the late rector of that parish, who was then nearly ninety,
and but little capable of attending to his duty, but having
married a young wife, she would not allow him a curate,
but every Sunday drove him from Fakenham to the church.
In short he was hen-pecked. His clerk kept the village
public-house, and was not over-attentive to his duties.
Our Cantab accompanied his friends to church at the usual
time, arriving at which they found doors close; neither
       Vicar or Moses        had arrived, nor did they appear till
half an hour after. Under these circumstances our Cantab
threw off the following epigram:


Like o        Whissonset church
In vain you       ll search,
The Lord be thanked for       t:
The parson is old,
His wife       s a scold,
And the clerk sells beer by the quart.

The people who go
Are but so so,
And but so so are the singers;
They roar in our ears
Like northern bears,
And the devil take the ringers.




CUSTOM, WHIM, FASHION, AND CAPRICE,

Have been pretty nearly as arbitrary in our universities as with the
rest of the world. When John Goslin was Vice-Chancellor, he is said to
have made it


A HEAVY FINE TO APPEAR IN BOOTS.

[Pg 153]
A student, however, undertook, for a small bet, to visit him in them,
and, to appease his wrath, he desired the doctor       s advice for an
hereditary numbness in his legs. So far was the Vice-Chancellor from
expressing any anger, that he pitied him, and he won his wager.
Another vice-chancellor is said to have issued his mandate for all
members in statu pupillari, to appear in


YELLOW STOCKINGS.

The following singular order, as to dress and the excess
thereof, was issued by the great statesman, Cecil, Lord
Burleigh, as chancellor of the University of Cambridge, in
the days of Elizabeth, which is preserved in the Liber
Niger, or Black-book, extant in the Cambridge University
Library. The paper is dated        from my house in Strand,
this seventhe of May, 1588,        and runs thus:       1.        That
no hat be worne of anie graduate or scholler within the
said universitie (except it shall be when he shall journey
owte of the towne, or excepte in the time of his sickness.)
All graduates were to weare square caps of clothe; and
schollers, not graduates, round cloth caps, saving that it
may be lawful for the sonnes of noblemen, or the sonnes
and heirs of knights, to weare round caps of velvet, but
no hats.       

2.        All graduates shall weare abroade in the universitie going owte of
his colledg, a gowne and a hoode of cloth, according to the order of
his degree. Provided that it shall be lawful for everie D. D., and for
the Mr. of anie coll. to weare a sarcenet tippet of velvet, according
to the anciente customes of this realme, and of the saide universitie.
The whiche gowne, tippet, and square caps, the saide Drs. and heads
shall be likewise bound to weare, when they shall resorte eyther to
the courte, or to the citie of London.       

3.        And that the excesse of shirt bands and ruffles, exceeding an
ynche and halfe (saving the sonnes of noblemen,) the fashion and
colour other than white, be avoided presentlie; and no scholler, or
fellowe of the foundation of anie house of learninge, do weare eyther
in the universitie or without,      c., anie hose, stockings, dublets, jackets,
[Pg 154]
crates, or jerknees, or anie other kynde of garment, of
velvet, satin, or silk, or in the facing of the same shall have above
a 1/4 of a yard of silke, or shall use anie other light kynde of
colour, or cuts, or gards, of fashion, the which shall be forbidden
by the Chancellor,             c.

4th.        And that no scholler doe weare anie long lockes of hair vppon
his head, but that he be notted, pouled, or rounded, after the
accustomed manner of the gravest schollers of the saide universitie.       
The penalty for every offence against these several orders being six
shillings and eightpence: the sum in which offenders are mulcted in
the present day.


THE FASHION OF THE HAIR

Has been not less varied, or less subject to animadversion,
than the dress of the members of the universities. The
fashion of wearing long hair, so peculiar in the reign of
Charles II., was called the Apollo. His Royal Highness
the Duke of Gloucester, the present Chancellor of the
University of Cambridge,        was an Apollo        during the
whole of his residence at Trinity College, says the Gradus
ad Cant. Indeed his royal highness, who was noted for
his personal beauty at that time, was        the last in Cambridge
who wore his hair after that fashion.               I can remember,       
says the pious Archbishop Tillotson, as cited
by the above writer, discoursing on this head, viz. of hair!
       since the wearing the hair below the ears was looked upon
as a sin of the first magnitude; and when ministers generally,
whatever their text was, did either find, or make,
occasion to reprove the great sin of long hair: and if they
saw any one in the congregation guilty in that kind, they
would point him out particularly, and let fly at him with
great zeal.        And we can remember, since wearing the
hair cropt, i. e. above the ears, was looked upon, though
not as        a sin,        yet, as a very vulgar and RAFFISH sort of
a thing; and when the doers of newspapers exhausted all
their wit in endeavouring to rally the new-raised corps of
CROPS, regardless of the late noble Duke (of Bedford) who
headed them; and, when the rude rank-scented rabble, if
they saw any one in the streets, whether time or the tonsor
[Pg 155]
had thinned his flowing hair, they would point him out
particularly and        let fly at him,        as the archbishop says,
till not a shaft of ridicule remained! The tax upon hair-powder
has now, however, produced all over the country
very plentiful CROPS. Charles II., who, as his worthy
friend the Earl of Rochester, remarked,


               never said a foolish thing;
Nor ever did a wise one,


sent a letter to the University of Cambridge, forbidding
the members to wear periwigs, smoke tobacco, and read
their sermons!! It is needless to remark, that TOBACCO has
not yet made its EXIT IN FUMO, and that periwigs still continue
to adorn        THE HEADS OF HOUSES.        Till the present
all-prevailing, all-accommodating fashion of CROPS became
general in the university, no young man presumed to dine
in hall till he had previously received a handsome trimming
from the hair-dresser (one of which calling was a special
appointment to each college.) The following inimitable
imitation of        The Bard        of Gray, is ascribed to the pen
of the late Lord Erskine, when a fellow-commoner of
Trinity College, Cambridge. Having been disappointed
of the attendance of his college-barber, he was compelled
to forego his commons in hall. But determining to have
his revenge, and give his hair-dresser a good DRESSING, he
sat down and penned the following        Fragment of a Pindaric
Ode,        wherein,        in imitation of the despairing Bard
of Gray, who prophesied the destruction of King Edward       s
race, he poured forth his curses upon the whole race of
barbers, predicting their ruin in the simplicity of a future
generation.       


I.


Ruin seize thee, scoundrel Coe!
Confusion on thy frizzing wait;
Hadst thou the only comb below,
Thou never more shouldst touch my pate.
Club, nor queue, nor twisted tail,
Nor e       en thy chatt       ring, barber! shall avail
To save thy horse-whipp       d back from daily fears,
From Cantab       s curse, from Cantab       s tears!
Such were the sounds that o       er the powder       d pride
Of Coe the barber scattered wild dismay,
[Pg 156]As down the steep of Jackson       s slippery lane,
He wound with puffing march his toilsome, tardy way.


II.


In a room where Cambridge town
Frowns o       er the kennel       s stinking flood,
Rob       d in a flannel powd       ring gown,
With haggard eyes poor Erskine stood;
(Long his beard and blouzy hair
Stream       d like an old wig to the troubled air;)
And with clung guts, and face than razor thinner,
Swore the loud sorrows of his dinner.
Hark! how each striking clock and tolling bell,
With awful sounds, the hour of eating tell!
O       er thee, oh Coe! their dreadful notes they wave,
Soon shall such sounds proclaim thy yawning grave;
Vocal in vain, through all this ling       ring day,
The grace already said, the plates all swept away.


III.


Cold is Beau * * tongue,
That soothed each virgin       s pain;
Bright perfumed M * * has cropp       d his head:
Almacks! you moan in vain.
Each youth whose high toupee
Made huge Plinlimmon bow his cloud-cropt head,
In humble Tyburn-top we see;
Esplashed with dirt and sun-burnt face;
Far on before the ladies mend their pace,
The Macaroni sneers, and will not see.
Dear lost companions of the coxcomb       s art,
Dear as a turkey to these famished eyes,
Dear as the ruddy port which warms my heart,
Ye sunk amidst the fainting Misses        cries.
No more I weep       they do not sleep:
At yonder ball a slovenly band,
I see them sit, they linger yet,
Avengers of fair Nature       s hand;
With me in dreadful resolution join,
To Crop with one accord, and starve their cursed line.


IV.


Weave the warp, and weave the woof,
The winding-sheet of barber       s race;
Give ample room, and verge enough,
Their lengthened lanthorn jaws to trace.
Mark the year, and mark the night,
When all their shops shall echo with affright;
Loud screams shall through St. James       s turrets ring,
To see, like Eton boy, the king!
[Pg 157]Puppies of France, with unrelenting paws,
That crape the foretops of our aching heads;
No longer England owns thy fribblish laws,
No more her folly Gallia       s vermin feeds.
They wait at Dover for the first fair wind,
Soup-meagre in the van, and snuff roast-beef behind.


V.


Mighty barbers, mighty lords,
Low on a greasy bench they lie!
No pitying heart or purse affords
A sixpence for a mutton-pye!
Is the mealy        prentice fled?
Poor Coe is gone, all supperless to bed.
The swarm that in thy shop each morning sat,
Comb their lank hair on forehead flat:
Fair laughs the morn, when all the world are beaux,
While vainly strutting through a silly land,
In foppish train the puppy barber goes;
Lace on his shirt, and money at command,
Regardless of the skulking bailiff       s sway,
That, hid in some dark court, expects his evening prey.


VI.


The porter-mug fill high,
Baked curls and locks prepare;
Reft of our heads, they yet by wigs may live,
Close by the greasy chair
Fell thirst and famine lie,
No more to art will beauteous nature give.
Heard ye the gang of Fielding say,
Sir John,[8] at last we       ve found their haunt,
To desperation driv       n by hungry want,
Thro        the crammed laughing Pit they steal their way.
Ye tow       rs of Newgate! London       s lasting shame,
By many a foul and midnight murder fed,
Revere poor Mr. Coe, the blacksmith       s[9] fame,
And spare the grinning barber       s chuckle head.


VII.


Rascals! we tread thee under foot,
(Weave we the woof, the thread is spun;)
Our beards we pull out by the root;
(The web is wove, your work is done.)
       Stay, oh, stay! nor thus forlorn
Leave me uncurl       d, undinner       d, here to mourn.       
[Pg 158]Thro        the broad gate that leads to College Hall,
They melt, they fly, they vanish all.
But, oh! what happy scenes of pure delight,
Slow moving on their simple charms unroll!
Ye rapt       rous visions! spare my aching sight,
Ye unborn beauties, crowd not on my soul!
No more our long-lost Coventry we wail:
All hail, ye genuine forms; fair nature       s issue, hail!


VIII.


Not frizz       d and frittered, pinned and rolled,
Sublime their artless locks they wear,
And gorgeous dames, and judges old,
Without their tetes and wigs appear.
In the midst a form divine,
Her dress bespeaks the Pennsylvania line;
Her port demure, her grave, religious face,
Attempered sweet to virgin grace.
What sylphs and spirits wanton through the air!
What crowds of little angels round her play!
Hear from thy sepulchre, great Penn! oh, hear!
A scene like this might animate thy clay.
Simplicity now soaring as she sings,
Waves in the eye of heaven her Quaker-coloured wings.


IX.


No more toupees are seen
That mock at Alpine height,
And queues, with many a yard of riband bound,
All now are vanished quite.
No tongs or torturing pin,
But every head is trimmed quite snug around:
Like boys of the cathedral choir,
Curls, such as Adam wore, we wear;
Each simpler generation blooms more fair,
Till all that       s artificial expire.
Vain puppy boy! think       st thou you essenced cloud,
Raised by thy puff, can vie with Nature       s hue?
To-morrow see the variegated crowd
With ringlets shining like the morning dew.
Enough for me: with joy I see
The different dooms our fates assign;
Be thine to love thy trade and starve,
To wear what heaven bestowed be mine.
He said, and headlong from the trap-stairs        height,
Quick thro        the frozen street he ran in shabby plight.

Whilst we are discussing the subject of hair, we ought not to forget
that, according to Lyson       s Environs of London,


[Pg 159]
THE FIRST PRELATE THAT WORE A WIG

was Archbishop Tillotson. In the great dining-room of Lambeth Palace,
he says, there are portraits of all the Archbishops, from Laud to the
present time, in which may be observed the gradual change of the
clerical habit, in the article of wigs. Archbishop Tillotson was the
first prelate that wore a wig, which then was not unlike the natural
hair, and worn without powder. In 1633, 21 James 1st,


THE OXFORD SCHOLARS WERE PROHIBITED FROM
WEARING BOOTS AND SPURS.

       Care was taken,        says Wood,        that formalities in
public assemblies should be used, which, through negligence,
were now, and sometime before, left off. That
the wearing of boots and spurs also be prohibited,        a
fashion        (as our Chancellor saith in his letters) rather befitting
the liberties of the Inns of Court than the strictness
of an academical life, which fashion is not only usurped by
the younger sort, but by the Masters of Arts, who preposterously
assume that part of the Doctor       s formalities which
adviseth them to ryde ad pr       dicandum Evangelium, but
in these days implying nothing else but animum deserendi
studium.        It was therefore ordered,        that no person that
wears a gown wear boots; if a graduate, he was to forfeit
2s. 6d. for the first time of wearing them, after order was
given to the contrary; for the second time 5s., and so toties
quoties. And if an


UNDERGRADUATE, WHIPPING,

Or other punishment, according to the will of the Vice-Chancellor and
Proctors, for every time he wore them.        And in 1608, when


ARCHBISHOP BANCROFT

Became Chancellor of Oxford, he decreed amongst other things,        that
indecency of attire be left off, and academical habits be used in
public assemblies, being now more remissly looked to than in former
times. Also, that no occasion of offence be given, long hair was not
to be worn; for whereas in the reign of Queen Elizabeth few or none
[Pg 160]
wore their hair longer than their ears (for they that did so were
accounted by the graver and elder sort swaggerers and ruffians,) now
it was common even among scholars, who were to be examples of modesty,
gravity, and decency.       



WAKEFIELD       S EPIGRAM ON THE FLYING BARBER OF CAMBRIDGE,

Which his college friend, Dyer, has given in his Supplement, under the
head        Seria Ludo,        with the happy, original motto       


With serious truths we mix a little fun,
And now and then we treat you with a pun.


The subject of the epigram, he says (the original of which
Mr. W. sent to a friend,)        was Mr. Foster, formerly of
Cambridge, who, on account of his rapidity in conversation,
in walking, and more particularly in the exercise of
his profession, was called (by the Cantabs) the Flying
Barber. He was a great oddity, and gave birth to many
a piece of fun in the university:       


Tonsor ego: vultus radendo spumcus albet,
Mappa subest, ardet culter, et unda tepet.
Quam versat gladium cito dextra, novacula levis,
Mox tua tam celeri strinxerit ora manu.
Cedite, Romani Tonsores, cedite Graii;
Tonsorem regio non habet ulla parem.
Imberbes Grantam, barbati accedite Grantam;
Illa polit mentes; et polit illa genas.




THE ISTHMUS OF SUEZ.

The men of St. John       s College, Cambridge, like every
other society in both Oxford and Cambridge, have their
soubriquet. From what cause they obtained that of
       Johnian Hogs        is yet scarcely settled, though much has
been written thereon, extant in The Gradus ad Cant.,
Faceti        Cant., and The Cambridge Tart. It proved of
[Pg 161]
some service, however, to a wag of the society (and to
them the merit of punning was conceded in the Spectator       s
time,) in giving him an idea for a name for the elegant one-arched
covered bridge which joins the superb Gothic court
they have lately added to the fine old college, after the
designs of Messrs. Hutchinson and Rickman of Birmingham.
The question was discussed at a wine party, and
one proposed calling it the        Bridge of Sighs,        as it led to
most of the tutors        and deans        rooms, from whom issued all
impositions (punishments,)      c.        I have it!        exclaimed
a wag, his eyes beaming brighter than his sparkling glass              I
have it! Call it the Isthmus of Suez!        Id est
The Hog       s Isthmus, from the Latin word sus, a sow,
which makes suis in the genitive case, and proves our
Johnian to be a punster worthy of his school.



YOU ARE TO PRAY AND FIGHT, NOT TO DRINK FOR THE CHURCH.

Mr. Jones, of Welwyn, relates, on the authority of Old
Mr. Bunburry, of Brazen-nose College, that Bishop Kennett,
when a young man, being one of the Oxford Pro-Proctors,
and a very active one, about James the Second       s
reign, going his rounds one evening, found a company of
gownsmen engaged on a drinking bout, to whom his then
high church principles were notorious (though he afterwards
changed them, sided with Bishop Hoadley, and obtained
the soubriquet of weather-cock Kennett.) When he
entered the room, he reprimanded them for keeping such
late hours, especially over the bottle, rather than over
their studies in their respective colleges, and ordered them
to disperse. One in the company, who knew his political
turn, addressed him with,        Mr. Proctor, you will, I am
sure, excuse us when I say, we were met to drink prosperity
to the church, to which you can have no objection.               Sir,       
was his answer, with a solemn air,        we are to pray for
the church, and to fight for the church, not to drink for
the church.        Upon which the company paid their reckoning
and dispersed. There is a curious print in the Library
[Pg 162]
of the Antiquarians, of an altar-piece, which the
rector of Whitechapel, Dr. Walton, caused to be painted
and put up in his church, representing Christ and his
twelve apostles eating the passover, wherein Bishop Kennett
(the        Traitor Dean,        as his siding with Hoadley
caused him to be designated) is painted as Judas.



SIGNS OF A GOOD APPETITE.

When a late master of Richmond School, Yorkshire,
came, a raw lad in his teens, to matriculate at Trinity
College, Cambridge, he was invited to dinner by his tutor,
and happened to be seated opposite some boiled fowls,
which, having just emptied a plate of his quantum of fish,
he was requested to carve. He accordingly took one on
his plate, but not being a carver, he leisurely ate the whole
of it, minus the bones, not at all disconcerted by the
smiles of the other guests: and when the cheese appeared,
and his host cut a plateful for him to pass round the table,
he coolly set to and eat the whole himself. He, notwithstanding,
proved a good scholar, and distinguished himself
both in classics and mathematics, is now a canon residentiary
of St. Paul       s, and a very worthy divine, who has
earned his reputation, preferments, and dignities by his
merits only.



A COLLEGE QUIZ.

The following effusion of humour was the production of
a very pleasant fellow, an Oxford scholar, now no more,
who, says Angelo, in his Reminiscences,        was a great favourite
among his brother collegians,        and a humourist:              Lost
       10 this morning, May 15, 1808, in Peckwater
Quadrangle, near No. 6. Any nobleman, gentleman,
common student, or commoner, who will, as soon as possible,
bring the same back to the afflicted loser, shall, with
pleasure, receive ten guineas reward; a suitor shall receive
five guineas; and a scout or porter, one guinea. The
[Pg 163]
notes were all Bank of England notes, I only received this
morning from my father. My name is               , and I
lodge at               , facing Tom Gate, where I am anxiously
waiting for some kind friend to bring them to me.       Vivant
Rex et Regina.       



SUCKING THE MILK OF BOTH UNIVERSITIES

Is an epithet applied to those members who, after graduating
at one proceeds to a like degree at the other. A
party one day disputing as to whether Oxford or Cambridge
was the more distinguished seat of learning,              It
can       t affect me,        exclaimed one of them,        for I was educated
at both.        Upon which a wag observed,        He reminded
him of a calf that was suckled by two cows.               How so?       
said the other.        Why, it turned out the greatest calf I
ever knew,        was the retort.



Amongst the musical professors of Cambridge, and not
the least, who was organist of King       s College also, in the
beginning of the eighteenth century, was Dr. Thomas
Tudway. He was a notorious wag, and when several of
the members of the University of Cambridge expressed
their discontent at the paucity of the patronage, and the
rigour of the government of the        proud Duke of Somerset,       
whose statue graces their senate house, he facetiously
observed       

       The Chancellor rides us all without a bit in our mouths.       


LIKE RABELAIS,

In him the passion for punning was strong in death, though less
profane. When he laid dangerously ill of the quinsy (of which he soon
after died,) his physician, seeing some hope, turned from his patient
to Mrs. Tudway, who was weeping in despair at his danger, and
observed,        Courage, madam! the Dr. will get up May-hill yet, he has
swallowed some nourishment.        Upon which Dr. Tudway said,
[Pg 164]
as well as his disease would permit him to articulate,        Don       t mind him,
my dear: one swallow don       t make a summer.       



AMBASSADORS OF KING JESUS AT OXFORD.

The Rev. Charles Godwyn, B. D., Fellow of Baliol
College, grandson to Dr. Francis G., Bishop of Hereford,
in a letter, dated March 14, 1768, printed in Nichols       s
Anecdotes, says,        a very sad affair has happened        at Oxford.
       The principal of Edmund Hall (Dr. George Dixon)
has been indiscreet enough to admit into his hall, by
the recommendation of Lady Huntingdon, seven London
tradesmen, one a tapster, another a barber,      c. They
have little or no learning, but all of them have a high opinion
of themselves, as being ambassadors of King Jesus.
One of them, upon that title conferred by himself, has been
a preacher. Complaint was made to the Vice-Chancellor,
Dr. David Durell (principal of Hertford College,) I believe,
by the Bishop of Oxford; and he, in his own right,
as Vice-Chancellor, had last week a visitation of the hall.
Some of the preaching tradesmen were found so void of
learning, that they were expelled from the hall.       



A SURPRISING EFFORT OF INTELLECT.

Robert Austin, a Fellow of King       s College, Cambridge,
was amanuensis to the famous Arabic professor, Wheelock,
who employed him in correcting the press of his Persic
Gospels, the first of the kind ever printed, with a Latin
translation and notes. Of this surprising young man, he
says,        in the space of two months, not knowing a letter in
Arabic or Persic at the beginning, he sent a letter to me
in Norfolk, of peculiar passages, so that of his age I never
met with the like; and his indefatigable patience, and honesty,
or ingenuity, exceed, if possible, his capacity.       
But his immoderate application brought on a derangement
of mind, and he died early in 1654.




[Pg 165]
JUDGMENT OF PROFESSOR HALLIFAX.

When Queen Elizabeth was questioned on the subject of her faith in the
Sacrament, she dexterously avoided giving offence by replying       


       Christ was the word that spake it,
He took the bread and brake it,
And what his word did make it,
That I believe, and take it.       


Scarcely less ingenious was the reply of Bishop Hallifax,
when Regius Professor of Civil Law at Cambridge, upon
Dr. Parr and the Rev. Joseph Smith (both resident at
Stanmore) applying to him for his judgment on a literary
dispute between them. His response was in the following
official language, by which he dexterously avoided the imputation
of partiality:       

       Nolo interponere judicium meum.       

His name reminds me that he married a Cooke, the daughter
of Dr. William Cooke, Provost of King       s College,
Cambridge, for whom George the Third had so great a
regard, that he extended it to his children. The Bishop
and his wife being at Cheltenham when the King was there,
and some person asking why his Majesty paid Dr. Hallifax
such marked respect, was answered,        Sir, he married a
Cooke.        This being in the presence of


THE CELEBRATED OXONIAN, DEAN TUCKER,

       I, too,        he facetiously remarked,        have a claim to his
Majesty       s attention, for I married a cook,        alluding to the
fact, that his second wife originally held that rank in his
domestic establishment.



OH! FOR A DISTICH.

A Pembrokian Cantab, named Penlycross, having written
an Essay, a candidate for the Norrisian prize (which
it was necessary he should subscribe with a Greek or Latin
[Pg 166]
motto, as well as a sealed letter, enclosing his name,
after being for a time at a loss for one,) and having an
ominous presentiment of its rejection, he seized his pen
and subscribed the following on both:


       Distichon ut poscas nolente, volente, Minerva,
Mos sacer? Unde mihi distichon? En perago.       

       Without a distich, vain the oration is;
Oh! for a distich! Doctor, e       en take this.       




SKELETON SERMONS.

The author of the Pursuits of Literature ridicules the
epithet        Skeleton Sermons,        as        ridiculous and absurd,       
speaking of those of the Rev. Charles Simeon, M.A. now
Senior Fellow of King       s College. When, in 1796, that
divine published his edition of Claude       s Essay on a Sermon,
with an Appendix containing one hundred Skeleton
Sermons, the celebrated Dr. William Cooke, father of the
late Regius Professor of Greek, was Provost of King       s, and
to him, as in duty bound, Mr. Simeon presented a copy.
The Provost read it with his natural appearance of a proud
and dignified humility, and, struck with the unfortunate
and somewhat ludicrous title of Skeleton Sermons,        Skeletons!
skeletons!        he exclaimed, in his significant way,
       Shall these dry bones live?        What would the Provost
have thought and said, had he lived to see an edition of
them in ten volumes 4to. price ten guineas?



I WISH HE HAD PAID IT FIRST.

The present Vice-Master of Trinity College, Cambridge,
being told that one of his pupils, the author of        Alma Mater,       
had therein published his bill, coolly replied,        I
wish he had paid it first.        Another Cantab had       


A MIND TO MAKE TRIAL OF THE STOCKS,

Which unluckily stood in the church-yard, and it happening
[Pg 167]
to be a saint       s day, the congregation were at prayers,
of which he was ignorant, when he got a friend to put
him in. His friend sauntered away, whether wilfully or
not I leave my readers to guess, and he was in vain struggling
to release himself, when the congregation issued
forth, who were not a little moved at his situation. Many
laughed, but one, an old woman, compassionately released
him. A similar story is told of the celebrated son of Granta,


LORD CHIEF JUSTICE PRATT,

Who had afterwards to try a cause in which the plaintiff
had brought his action against a magistrate for falsely imprisoning
him in the stocks. The counsel for the defence
arguing that the action was a frivolous one, on the ground
that the stocks were no punishment, his Lordship beckoned
his learned brother to him, and told him, in his ear,
that having himself been put in the stocks, he could assure
him it was no such slight punishment as he represented,
and the plaintiff obtained a verdict against the magistrate
in consequence.



HISSING VERSUS MONEY.

Parker says, in his Musical Memoirs, that the Oxford scholars once
hissed Madame Mara, conceiving she assumed too much importance in her
bearing. No wonder they so treated Signor Samperio, one evening at a
concert, attracted, when he came forward to sing, by his        tall, lank
figure, sunken eyes, hollow cheeks, and shrill voice;        in fact, they
hissed him off before he had half got through his cavatina. The
gentleman who acted as steward was deeply moved at his situation, and,
going up to Samperio, endeavoured to soothe him. But the signor, not
at all hurt, replied,        O, sare, never mind; dey may hissa me as much
as dey please, if I getti di money.        Another anecdote is told of       


TWO OXFORD SCHOLARS POSING DR. HAYES,

The late musical professor, who was some six feet high,
[Pg 168]
and scarcely inferior in bulk to the famous Essex miller.
He had at last so much difficulty in getting in and out of
a stage coach, that whenever he went from Oxford to London
to conduct the annual performances at St. Paul       s, for
the benefit of the Sons of the Clergy, which he did for many
years gratis, his custom was to engage a whole seat to
himself, and when once in and seated to remain so till the
end of the journey. The fact became known to two Oxford
wags, who resolved to pose the Doctor, and to that end
engaged the other two inside places, and taking care to be
there before him, seated themselves in the opposite corners,
one to the right the other to the left, and there the Doctor
found them, on arriving to take his place.        How was he
to dispose of his corpus?        was the query: they had a clear
right to their seats, and no alternative seemed left him, as
they declined moving, but to place his head in one corner
and his feet in the other. At last our Oxonians, having
fully enjoyed the dilemma in which they had placed the
Doctor, consented to give way, confessed their purpose,
and even the Doctor had the good sense to laugh at his own
expense.



GROSS INDEED.

When the celebrated Cantab, and editor of Lucretius,
Gilbert Wakefield, was convicted of a libel before the late
Judge Grose, who sentenced him to fine and imprisonment,
turning from the bar, he said, with the spirit of a Frenchman,
it was              gross indeed.        To the same learned Cantab,
Dyer attributes the following       


PUN UPON PYE.

Being asked once his opinion of the poetry of Pye, the
then Poet Laureat, his reply was, that he thought very
handsomely of some of Mr. P.       s poems, which he had
read. This did not suffice, and he was pressed for his opinion
of the Laureat-Ode that had just appeared in the public
prints. Not having seen it, he desired his friend to
read it to him, and the introductory lines containing something
[Pg 169]
about the singing of birds, Wakefield abruptly
silenced him with this happy allusion to the Laureat       s
name, in the following nursery rhymes:       


       And when the pie was opened,
The birds began to sing:
And was not this a dainty dish
To set before a king.       




THE CAMBRIDGE FAMILY OF SPINTEXTS

Begun with John Alcock, LL.D., Bishop of Ely, and founder of Jesus College.


       Garrulus hunc quando consumet cunq; loquaces,
Si sapiat, vitet, simul atque adoluerit        tas.       


In 1483, says Wilson, in his Memorabilia Cantabrigi       ,
he preached before the University        Bonum et blandum
sermonem pr       dicavit, et duravit in horam tertiam et ultra,       
which is supposed to be a sermon that was printed in his
lifetime, in 1498, by the famous Pynson, entitled,        Galli
Cantus ad Confratres suos Curatos in Synodo, apud
Barnwell, 25th September, 1498,        at the head of which is
a print of the Bishop preaching to the Clergy, with a cock
at each side, and another in the first page. The next
most celebrated preacher of this class was


DOCTOR ISAAC BARROW,

The friend, partly tutor, and most learned contemporary
of Newton, whom Charles the Second said was an unfair
preacher, leaving nothing new to be said by those who followed
him. He was once appointed, upon some public
occasion, to preach before the Dean and Chapter in Westminster
Abbey, and gave them a discourse of nearly four
hours in length. During the latter part of it, the congregation
became so tired of sitting, that they dropped out, one
by one, till scarcely another creature besides the Dean and
choristers were left. Courtesy kept the Dean in his place,
but soon his patience got the better of his manners,

       Verba per attentam non ibunt C       saris aurem,       

[Pg 170]
and beckoning one of the singing boys, he desired him to go and tell
the organist to play him down, which was done. When asked, on
descending from the pulpit, if he did not feel exhausted, he replied,
       No; only a little tired with standing so long.        A third        long-winded
preacher        (and they were never admired at either Oxford or Cambridge,
where        short and sweet        is preferred) was


DOCTOR SAMUEL PARR.

He delivered his justly celebrated Spital Sermon in
the accustomed place, Christ-Church, Newgate Street,
Easter Tuesday, 1800, before his friend, Harvey Christian
Combe, Esq., M.P., the celebrated brewer, then Lord
Mayor.        Before the service begun,        says one of his
friends,        I went into the vestry, and found Dr. Parr seated,
with pipes and tobacco placed before him on the table. He
evidently felt the importance of the occasion, but felt, at
the same time, a confidence in his own powers. When
he ascended the pulpit, a profound silence prevailed. The
sermon occupied nearly an hour and a quarter in the delivery;
and in allusion to its extreme length, it was remarked
by a lady, who had been asked her opinion of it,
       enough there is, and more than enough              the first words
of its first sentence,       a bon mot he is said to have received
with good humour. As he and the Lord Mayor were
coming out of the church, the latter, albeit unused to the
facetious mode,        Well,        said Dr. Parr to him, always
anxious for well-merited praise,        how did you like the sermon?
Let me have the suffrage of your strong and honest
understanding.               Why, Doctor,        returned his lordship,
       there were four things in your sermon I did not like to
hear.               State them,        replied Parr, eagerly.        Why, to
speak frankly, then,        said Combe,        they were the quarters
of the church clock, which struck four times before you had
finished it.               I once saw, lying in the Chapter Coffee-house,       
says Dyer, in a letter printed in Parriana,        the
Doctor       s Spital Sermon, with a comical caricature of him,
in the pulpit, preaching and smoking at the same time,
with ex fumo dare lucem issuing from his mouth.       


[Pg 171]
ANOTHER CLASS OF PREACHERS

At Cambridge, and eke at Oxford, have taken an opposite
course, and from their being to be had at all times, have at the
former place, obtained the soubriquet        Hack Preachers.       
In the Gradus ad Cantabrigiam, they are described as
       the common exhibitioners at St. Mary       s, employed in the
service of defaulters and absentees. It must be confessed,
however,        adds this writer,        that these HACKS are good
fast trotters, as they commonly go over the course in twenty
minutes, and sometimes less.        Gilbert Wakefield,
whom nobody will suspect of forbearance, calls them, in
his Memoirs,        a piteous, unedifying tribe.        This, however,
can scarcely be applied to the ordinary preachers of
the present day, and especial care is taken by the heads of
the university that the select preachers (one of whom is
named for each month during term-time) do not name substitutes
themselves. The following poetic jeu d       esprit,
entitled        Lines on three of the appointed Preachers of St.
Mary       s, Cambridge, attacking Calvin        were no others
than the three eminent living divines, Dr. Butler, Dr.
Maltby, Bishop of Chichester, and Dr. Herbert Marsh,
Bishop of Peterborough:       


       Three Preachers, in three distant counties born,
The Church of England       s doctrines do adorn:
Harsh Calvin       s mystic tenets were their mark,
Founded in texts perverted, gloomy, dark.
Butler in clearness and in force surpassed,
Maltby with sweetness spoke of ages past;
Whilst Marsh himself, who scarce could further go,
With Criticism       s fetters bound the foe.       


This punning morsel, of some standing in the university,
is scarce surpassed by Hood himself:       


THE THREE-HEADED PRIEST.


Old Doctor Delve, a scribbling quiz,
Afraid of critics        jibes,
By turns assumes the various phiz
Of three old classic scribes.

Though now with high erected head,
And lordly strut he       ll go by us,
[Pg 172]He once made lawyers        robes,        tis said,
And called himself Mac-robius.

Last night I asked the man to sup,
Who showed a second alias;
He gobbled all my jellies up,
O greedy Aulus Gellius.

On Sunday, arrogant and proud,
He purrs like any tom-puss,
And reads the Word of God so loud,
He must be Theo-pompus.




MY BEEF BURNT TO A CINDER.

The family of the Spintexts have, it appears, very lately
put forth a scion, in the person of a learned divine, a Fellow
of Trinity College, Cambridge, who, being appointed
a Select Preacher in 1835, delivered a discourse of the extraordinary
duration of an hour and a half! The present
Father of the University and Master of Peter-house, Dr.
Francis Barnes, upwards of ninety years of age, was one
of the heads present. He sat out the first three quarters
of an hour, but then began to be fidgetty. Another quarter
of an hour expired,       the preacher was still in the midst
of his discourse. The Doctor (now become right down
impatient,) being seated the lowest (next to the Vice-Chancellor)
in Golgotha, or the        Place of Skulls,        as it is called,
he moved, first one seat higher (the preacher is still on
his legs,) then to a third, then to a fourth, then to a fifth;
and before the hour and a half had quite expired, he joined
one of the junior esquire bedells at the top, to whom he
observed, with that original expression of face for which
he is so remarkable,        my beef is burnt to a cinder.       



SHORT HAND WRITING WAS INVENTED BY A CANTAB,

According to the first volume of the Librarian, published
by Mr. Savage, of the London Institution; who says, that
the first work printed on the subject was by Dr. Timothy
[Pg 173]
Bright, of Cambridge, in 1598, who dedicated it to Queen Elizabeth,
under the title of        An art of short, swift, and secret writing, by
Character.       



THE HUMBLE PETITION OF THE LADIES.

Before the erection of the Senate-House in the University
of Cambridge, the annual grand Commencement was
held in St. Mary       s, the University church.        It seems,       
says Dyer, in his History of Cambridge,        that on these
occasions (the time when gentlemen take their degrees       )
that is, the degree of M.A. more particularly,        ladies had
been allowed to sit in that part of the church assigned to
the doctors, called THE THRONE: it was, however, at length
agreed amongst them (the doctors) that ladies should be
no longer permitted to sit there; and the place assigned
to them was under the throne, in the church.        This invasion
of what the fair almost looked upon as the abstraction
of a right, led to a partial war of words and inuendos,
and the matter was at last taken up by the facetious Roger
Long, D.D., Master of Pembroke College, who, he adds,
in his Supplement to his History, was celebrated for his
Treatise on Astronomy, and for his erection of a sphere in
his College eighteen feet in diameter, still shown there.
On this humorous occasion, he was a dissentient against
the Heads, not a little bustle was excited amongst the
Cambridge ladies, a subject for a few jokes was afforded
the wags of the University, and he produced his famous
music-speech, spoken at the public Commencement of
1714, on the 6th of July, which was afterwards published,
but is now very scarce. It was delivered in an assumed
character, as        being the Petition of the Ladies of Cambridge,       
and is full of whim and humour, in Swift       s best
manner, beginning       


       The humble petition of the ladies, who are all ready to be eaten up with the spleen,
To think they are to be cooped up in the Chancel, where they can neither see nor be seen,
But must sit in the dumps by themselves, all stew       d and pent up,
And can only peep through the lattice, like so many chickens in a coop;
[Pg 174]Whereas last Commencement the ladies had a gallery provided near enough,
To see the heads sleep, and the fellow-commoners take snuff.       


       How he could have delivered it in so sacred a place as St. Mary       s,       
says Dyer,        is matter of surprise (though they say, good fun, like
good coin, is current any where.       ) It is pleasant to see a grave man
descend from his heights, as Pope says,        to guard the fair.        Though
nobody could probably be much offended at the time, unless the
Vice-Chancellor, whom, if we understand the writer       s meaning, he calls
an old woman, when he says       


       Such cross ill-natured doings as these are, even a saint would vex,
To see a Vice-Chancellor so barbarous to one of his own sex.       


But the Doctor had


A NATURAL TURN FOR HUMOUR,

As is further illustrated by the celebrated Mr. Jones, of
Welwyn, who calls him        a very ingenious person.               At
the public Commencement of 1713,        he says,        Dr. Greene
(Master of Bene       t College, and afterwards Bishop of Ely)
being then Vice-Chancellor, Mr. Long was pitched upon
for the tripos performance: it was witty and humorous,
and has passed through divers editions. Some who remembered
the delivery of it, told me, that in addressing
the Vice-Chancellor (whom the University wags usually
styled Miss Greene,) the tripos-orator, being a native of
Norfolk, and assuming the Norfolk dialect, instead of saying
Domine Vice-Cancellarie, did very audibly pronounce
the words thus,       Domina Vice-Cancellaria; which occasioned
a general smile in that great auditory.        I could
recollect several other


INGENIOUS REPARTEES

Of his, if there were occasion, adds Mr. Jones: but his
friend, Mr. Bonfoy, of Ripon, told me this little incident:       that
he, and Dr. Long walking together in Cambridge,
in a dusky evening, and coming to a short post fixed in the
pavement, which Mr. B., in the midst of chat and inattention,
took to be a boy standing in his way, he said in a
[Pg 175]
hurry,        Get out of my way, boy.               That boy, sir,        said
the Doctor, very calmly and slily,        is a post boy, who
turns off his way for nobody.       



CELEBRATED ALL OVER GERMANY.

George the Second is said, like his father, to have had a strong
predilection for his continental dominions, of which his ministers did
not fail, occasionally, to take advantage. A residentiary of St.
Paul       s cathedral happening to fall vacant, Lord Granville was anxious
to secure it for the learned translator of Demosthenes, Dr. John
Taylor, fellow of St. John       s College, Cambridge. The King started some
scruples at first, but his Lordship carried his point easily, on
assuring his Majesty, which was the fact, that        the Doctor       s learning
was celebrated all over Germany.       



REBUSES AT OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE.



BECKINGTON.

The learned prelate, at whose expense the rector       s lodgings
were built at Lincoln College, Oxford, is commemorated
by his rebus, a beacon and a tun, which may still be
traced on the walls.


ALCOCK,

Founder of Jesus College, Cambridge, and Bishop of Ely,
either rebused himself, or was rebused by others, in almost
every conspicuous part of his College, by a cock perched
upon a globe. On one window is a cock with a label from
its mouth, bearing the inscription,                                            
                                          : to which
another opposite bravely crows, says Cole,
                                                                    :


       I am a cock!        the one doth cry:
And t       other answers              So am I.       


There is a plate of him at the head of his celebrated Sermon,
[Pg 176]
printed by Pynson, in 1498, with a cock at each side, and another on the
first page. The subject of the discourse is the crowing of the cock when
Peter denied Christ.


EGLESFIELD,

The celebrated founder of Queen       s College, Oxford, who
was a native of Cumberland, and confessor to Philippa,
Queen of Edward the Third, gave the College, for its arms,
three spread eagles; but a singular custom, according to a
rebus, has been founded upon the fanciful derivation of his
name, from aiguille, needle, and fil, thread; and it became
a commemorative mark of respect, continued to this day,
for each member of the College to receive from the Bursar,
on New Year       s Day, a needle and thread, with the advice,
       Take this and be thrifty.               These conceits were not
unusual at the time the College was founded,        says Chalmers,
in his History of Oxford,        and are sometimes thought
trifling, merely because we cannot trace their original use
and signification. Hollingshed informs us, that when the
Prince of Wales, afterwards Henry the Fifth, who was
educated at this College, went to Court in order to clear
himself from certain charges of disaffection, he wore a
gown of blue satin, full of oilet holes, and at every hole a
needle hanging by a silk thread. This is supposed to
prove at least, that he was an academician of Queen       s, and
it may be conjectured that this was the original academical
dress.        The same writer says, the Founder ordered that
the Society should        be called to their meals by the sound
of the trumpet (a practice which still prevails, as does a
similar one at the Middle Temple, London,) and the Fellows
being placed on one side of the table in robes of scarlet
(those of the Doctor       s faced with black fur,) were to
oppose in philosophy the poor scholars, who, in token of
submission and humility, kept on the other side. As late
as the last century the Fellows and Taberders used sometimes
to dispute on Sundays and holidays.


ASHTON.

In an arched recess of the ante-chapel of St. John       s College,
Cambridge, is the tomb of the celebrated Dr. Hugh
[Pg 177]
Ashton, who took part with the famous Bishop Fisher (beheaded
by Henry the Eighth) in the erection of the buildings
of that learned foundation, and was the second Master
of the Society. His tomb, as Fuller observes, exhibits
       the marble effigy of his body when living, and the humiliating
contrast of his skeleton when dead, with the usual
conceit of the times, the figure of an ash tree growing out
of a tun.       


LAKE LEMAN.

Dyer records of the learned contemporary and antiquarian
coadjutor of the late Bishop of Cloyne, the Rev. Mr.
Leman, a descendant of the famous Sir Robert Naunton,
Public Orator at Cambridge, and a Secretary of State, that
       his drawing-room was painted en fresco with the scenery
around Lake Leman.       


SOMETHING IN YOUR WAY.

The same relates of himself, that, one day looking at
some caricatures at a window in Fleet-street, Peter Pindar
(Dr. Wolcot,) whom he knew, came up to him.
       There, sir,        said Mr. Dyer to the Doctor, pointing to the
caricatures,        is something in your way.               And there is
something in your way,        rejoined the Doctor, pointing to
some of the ladies of the pave who happened to be passing.
Peter was sure to pay in full.


DUNS

Have ever been a grievous source of disquietude to both
Oxonians and Cantabs. Tom Randolph, the favourite son
of Ben Johnson, made them the subject of his muse. But
in no instance, perhaps, have the race been so completely
put to the blush,        couleur de rose,        as by the following


ODE ON THE PLEASURE OF BEING OUT OF DEBT.

Horace, Ode XXII. Book I. Imitated.

Integer vit        scelerisque purus,      c.


I.


The man who not a farthing owes,
Looks down with scornful eye on those
Who rise by fraud and cunning;
[Pg 178]Though in the Pig-market he stand,
With aspect grave and clear-starched band,
He fears no tradesman       s dunning.



II.


He passes by each shop in town,
Nor hides his face beneath his gown,
No dread his heart invading;
He quaffs the nectar of the Tuns,
Or on a spur-gall       d hackney runs
To London masquerading.



III.


What joy attends a new-paid debt!
Our Manciple[10] I lately met,
Of visage wise and prudent;
I on the nail my battels paid,
The master turn       d away dismay       d,
Hear this each Oxford student!



IV.


With justice and with truth to trace
The grisly features of his face,
Exceeds all man       s recounting;
Suffice, he look       d as grim and sour
As any lion in the Tower,
Or half starved cat-a-mountain.



V.


A phiz so grim you scarce can meet,
In Bedlam, Newgate, or the Fleet,
Dry nurse of faces horrid!
Not Buckhorse fierce, with many a bruise,
Displays such complicated hues
On his undaunted forehead.



VI.


Place me on Scotland       s bleakest hill,
Provided I can pay my bill,
Stay ev       ry thought of sorrow;
There falling sleet, or frost, or rain,
Attack a soul resolved, in vain       
It may be fair to-morrow.



[Pg 179]
VII.


To Haddington then let me stray,
And take Joe Pullen       s tree away,
I       ll ne       er complain of Ph      bus;
But while he scorches up the grass,
I       ll fill a bumper to my lass,
And toast her in a rebus.



[10]
Churton says, in his Lives of the Founders of Brazenose College,
Oxford, that        Manciples, the purveyors general of Colleges and
Halls, were formerly men of so much consequence, that, to check
their ambition, it was ordered by an express statute, that no Manciple
should be Principal of a Hall.       


QUEERING A DUN.

A Cambridge wag who was skilled in the science of electricity,
as well as in the art of ticking, having got in pretty
deep with his tailor, who was continually dunning him
for payment, resolved to give snip        a settler,        as he said,
the next time he mounted his stairs. He accordingly
charged his electrifying machine much deeper than usual,
and knowing pretty well the time of snip       s approach, watched
his coming to the foot of the stairs where he kept, and ere
he could reach the door, fixed the conductor to the brass
handle. The tailor having long in vain sought occasion to
catch him with his outer door not sported, was so delighted
at finding it so, that, resolving not to lose time, he seized
the handle of the inner door, so temptingly exposed to
view, determining to introduce himself to his creditor sans
ceremonie. No sooner, however, did his fingers come in
contact with it than the shock followed, so violent, that it
stunned him for an instant: but recovering himself, he
bolted as though followed, as the poet says, by        ten thousand
devils,        never again to return.



GRAY THE POET A CONTRAST TO BISHOP WARBURTON.

Gray       s letters, and Bishop Warburton       s polemical writings,
show, that in more respects than one they were gifted
with a like temperament: but in the following instances
they form a contrast to each other. In the library of the
British Museum is an interesting letter occasioned by the
death of the Rev. N. Nicholls, LL.B., Rector of Loud and
Bradwell, in Suffolk, from the pen of the now generally
[Pg 180]
acknowledged author of        The Pursuits of Literature,       
J. T. Mathias, M.A., in which he says, that shortly after
that elegant scholar, and lamented divine, became a student
of Trinity Hall, Cambridge, at the age of eighteen, a
friend introduced him to Gray, the poet, at that time redolent
with fame, and resident in Peter-House, to speak to
whom was honourable; but to be admitted to his acquaintance,
or to his familiarity, was the height of youthful, or
indeed of any ambition. Shortly after this, Mr. N. was
in a company of which Mr. Gray was one; and, as it became
his youth, he did not enter into conversation, but
listened with attention. The subject, however, being
general and classical, and as Mr. Nicholls, even at that
early period, was acquainted not only with the Greek and
Latin, but with many of the best Italian poets, he ventured,
with great diffidence, to offer a short remark, and happened
to illustrate what he had said by an apposite quotation
from Dante. At the name of Dante, Mr. Gray suddenly
turned round to him and said,        Right: but have
you read Dante, sir?               I have endeavoured to understand
him,        replied Mr. N. Mr. Gray being much pleased
with the illustration, and with the taste which it evinced,
addressed the chief of his discourse to him for the remainder
of the evening, and invited him to his rooms in Pembroke
Hall; and finding him ready and docile, he became
attached to him and gave him instruction in the course of
his studies, to which, adds Mr. Mathias,        I attribute the
extent and value of his knowledge, and the peculiar accuracy
and correct taste which distinguished him throughout
life, and which I have seldom observed in any man in a
more eminent degree.        And I wish every young man of
genius might hear and consider, observes Mr. M., commenting
upon an incident so honourable to all parties,        the


VALUE OF A WORD SPOKE IN DUE SEASON,

With modesty and propriety, in the highest, I mean the most learned
and virtuous company.        What a different spirit was evinced, in the
following incident, by that great polemical writer, Bishop Warburton:
but it happily originated


[Pg 181]
THE CANONS OF CRITICISM,

Which were the production of Thomas Edwards, an Etonian
and King       s College man, where he graduated M.A.
in 1734, but missing a fellowship, turned soldier. After
he had been some time in the army, says a writer in the
Gentleman       s Magazine, for 1779, it so happened that, being
at Bath, after Mr. Warburton       s marriage to Mr. Allen       s
niece, he was introduced at Prior Park, en famille.
The conversation not unfrequently turning on literary
subjects, Mr. Warburton generally took the opportunity
of showing his superiority in Greek, not having the least
idea that an officer of the army understood anything of that
language, or that Mr. Edwards had been bred at Eton; till
one day, being accidentally in the library, Mr. Edwards
took down a Greek author, and explained a passage in it
in a manner that Mr. Warburton did not approve. This
occasioned no small contest; and Mr. Edwards (who had
now discovered to Mr. Warburton how he came by his
knowledge) endeavoured to convince him, that he did not
understand the original language, but that his knowledge
arose from French translations. Mr. Warburton was
highly irritated; an incurable breach took place; and this
trifling altercation (after Mr. Edwards had quitted the army
and was entered of Lincoln       s Inn) produced The Canons
of Criticism.



BISHOP BARRINGTON       S SPLENDID GIFT, AND OTHER TRAITS OF HIM.

That munificent prelate and Oxonian, Dr. Shute Barrington,
sixth son of the first Viscount, and the late Bishop of
Durham, a prelate, indeed, whose charities were unbounded,
was so conscientious in the discharge of his functions,
that he personally examined all candidates for Holy Orders,
and, however strongly they might be recommended,
rejected all that appeared unworthy of the sacred trust.
On one occasion, a relative, relying for advancement upon
his patronage, having intimated a desire to enter the
[Pg 182]
Church, the Bishop inquired with what preferment he
would be contented.        Five hundred pounds a year will
satisfy all my wants,        was the reply.        You shall have
it,        answered the conscientious prelate:        not out of the
patrimony of the Church, but out of my private fortune.       
The same Bishop gave the entire of 60,000l. at once, for
founding schools, unexpectedly recovered in a lawsuit;
and amongst other persons of talent, preferred Paley to
the valuable living of Bishop Wearmouth, unsolicited and
totally unknown to him, save through his valuable writings.



AN ADMIRABLE PULPIT ADMONITION

Is recorded of the celebrated Fellow of Trinity College,
Cambridge, the Rev. James Scott, M. A., better known as
Anti-Sejanus, who acquired extraordinary eminence as a
pulpit orator, both in and out of the University. He frequently
preached at St. Mary       s, where crowds of the University
attended him. On one occasion he offended the
Undergraduates, by the delivery of a severe philippic
against gaming; which they deeming a work of supererogation,
evinced their displeasure by scraping the floor with
their feet (an old custom now scarcely resorted to twice
in a century.) He, however, severely censured them for
this act of indecorum, shortly afterwards, in another discourse,
for which he selected the appropriate text,        Keep
thy feet when thou goest to the House of God.       



THE SIMPLICITY OF GREAT MINDS.

It is not surprising that our distinguished philosophers
and mathematicians have rarely evinced much knowledge
of men and manners, or of the ordinary circumstances of
life, since they are so much occupied in telling        the number
of the stars,        in tracing the wonders of creation, or in
balancing the mental and physical powers of man. Our
illustrious Cantab, Bacon, says his biographer, was cheated
by his servants at the bottom, whilst he sat in abstraction
[Pg 183]
at the top of his table; and he of whom Dr. Johnson said
(the great and good Newton,) that had he lived in the
days of ancient Greece, he would have been worshipped
as a deity; of whom, too, the poet wrote       


       Nature and Nature       s laws lay hid in night,
God said,        Let Newton be,        and all was light,       


Caused a smaller hole to be perforated in his room door,
when his favourite cat had a kitten, not remembering that
it would follow puss through the larger one. Another
more modern and less distinguished but not less amiable
Cantab, who was Senior Wrangler in his year, one day
inquired       


       OF WHAT COUNTRY MARINES WERE?       

Another distinguished Senior Wrangler, Professor and
divine, occasionally amuses his friends by rehearsing the
fact, that once, having, to preach in the neighbourhood of
Cambridge, he hired a blind horse to ride the distance on,
and his path laying cross a common, where the road was
but indistinctly marked, he became so absorbed in abstract
calculations, that, forgetting to guide his steed aright, he
and the horse wandered so far awry, that they tumbled
       head over heels,        as the folks say, upon a cow slumbering
by the way side. On dit, the same Cantab was one
morning caught over his breakfast-fire with an egg in his
hand, to minute the time by, and his       


WATCH DOING TO A TURN IN THE SAUCEPAN.

When he went in for A.B. his natural diffidence prevented
his doing much in the first four days of the Senate House
examination, and he was consequently bracketted low: but
rallying his confidence, he challenged all the men of his
years, and was Senior Wrangler. This incident caused
him to be received with rapturous applause, upon his being
presented to the Vice-Chancellor for his degree, on the
following Saturday. A few days after he is said to have
been in London, and entered one of the larger theatres at
the same instant with Royalty itself:       the audience rose
with one accord, and thunders of applause followed!
[Pg 184]
       This is too much,        said our Cantab to his friend, modestly
hiding his face in his hat, having, in the simplicity
of his heart, taken the huzzas and claps to be an improved
edition of the Senate House. Another Cantab, who was
also a Senior Wrangler, and guilty of many singularities,
as well as some follies, one who has unjustly heaped reproach
on the head of his Alma Mater (see his        Progress
of a Senior Wrangler at Cambridge,        in the numbers of
the defunct London Magazine,) had the following quaternion
posted on his room door in Trinity:       


       King Solomon in days of old,
The wisest man was reckon       d:
I fear as much cannot be told
Of Solomon the Second.       




A HOST OF SINGULARITIES

Are recorded of the famous Cantab and Etonian, the Rev.
George Harvest, B. D., who was one day walking in the
Temple Gardens, London, with the son of his patron, the
great Speaker Onslow, when he picked up a curious pebble,
observing he would keep it for his friend, Lord Bute.
He and his companion were going to The Beef-steak Club,
then held in Ivy-lane. Mr. Onslow asked him what o       clock
it was, upon which he took out his watch, and observed
they had but ten minutes good. Another turn or two was
proposed, but they had scarcely made half the length of
the walk, when he coolly put the pebble into his fob, and
threw his watch into the Thames. He was at another
time in a boat with the same gentleman, when he began to
read a favourite Greek author (for, like Porson, his coat
pockets generally contained a moderate library) with such
emphasis and strange gesticulations, that


HIS WIG AND HAT FELL INTO THE WATER,

And he coolly stepped overboard to recover them, without
once dreaming that it was not terra-firma, and was fished
out with great difficulty. He frequently wrote a letter to
one person, forgot to subscribe his name to it, and directed
[Pg 185]
it to another. On one occasion he provided himself with
three sermons, having been appointed to preach before the
Archdeacon and Clergy of the district. Some wags got
them, and having intermixed the leaves, stitched them
together in that state, and put them into his sermon-case.
He mounted the pulpit at the usual time, took his text,
but soon surprised his reverend audience by taking leave
of the thread of his discourse. He was, however, so insensible
to the dilemma in which he was placed, that he
went preaching on. At last the congregation became impatient,
both from the length and the nature of his sermon.
First the archdeacon slipped out, then the clergy, one by
one, followed by the rest of the congregation; but he never
flagged, and would have finished


HIS TRIPLE, THRICE-CONFUSED DISCOURSE,

Had not the clerk reminded him that they were the sole occupants of
the lately-crowded church. He went down to Cambridge to vote for his
Eton contemporary,


THE CELEBRATED LORD SANDWICH,

When the latter was candidate for the dignity of High-steward
of the University, in opposition to Pitt. His
lordship invited him to dine with some friends at the Rose
Inn.        Apropos, my lord,        exclaimed Harvest, during the
meal,        whence do you derive your nick-name of Jemmy
Twitcher?               Why,        said his lordship,        from some foolish
fellow.               No, no,        said Harvest,        not from some,
for every body calls you so;        on which his lordship, knowing
it to be the favourite dish of his quondam friend, put
a huge slice of plum-pudding upon his plate, which effectually
stopped his mouth. His lordship has the credit of
being the originator and first President of the Cambridge
Oriental Club. He was also


THE INVENTOR OF SANDWICHES.

Once passing a whole day at some game of which he was
fond, he became so absorbed in its progress, that he denied
himself time to eat, in the usual way, and ordered a slice
[Pg 186]
of beef between two pieces of toasted bread, which he masticated
without quitting his game; and that sort of refreshment
has ever since borne the designation of a Sandwich.
Parkes, in his Musical Memoirs, gives him the credit of


LAPSUS LINGU       .

It happened, he says, that during a feast given to his
lordship by the Corporation of Worcester, when he was
First Lord of the Admiralty, a servant let fall a dish with
a boiled neat       s tongue, as he was bringing it to table. The
Mayor expressing his concern to his lordship,        Never
mind,        said he,        it       s only a lapsus lingu       !        which Witty
saying creating a great deal of mirth, one of the Aldermen
present, at a dinner he gave soon after, instructed his servant
to throw down a roast leg of mutton, that he too might
have his joke. This was done;        Never mind,        he exclaimed
to his friends,        it       s only a lapsus lingu       .        The
company stared, but he begun a roaring laugh, solus.
Finding nobody joined therein, he stopped his mirth, saying,
that when Lord Sandwich said it, every body laughed,
and he saw no reason why they should not laugh at him.
This sally had the desired effect, and the company, one
and all, actually shook their sides, and our host was
satisfied.



OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE LOYALTY.

In 1717, George I. and his ministers had contrived to make themselves
so unpopular, that the badges of the disaffected, oaken boughs, were
publicly worn on the 29th of May, and white roses on the birth-day
of the Pretender, the 10th of June. Oxford, and especially the
university, manifested such strong feelings, that it was deemed
expedient to send a military force there: Cambridge, more inclined to
the Whig principles of the court and government, was at the same time
complimented with a present of books. Upon this occasion, Dr. Trapp,
the celebrated Oxford poet and divine, wrote the following epigram:       


Our royal master saw, with heedful eyes,
The wants of his two universities:
[Pg 187]Troops he to Oxford sent, as knowing why
That learned body wanted loyalty;
But books to Cambridge gave, as well discerning
How that right loyal body wanted learning.


Cambridge, as may be well supposed, was not backward
in retorting: and an able champion she found in her equally
celebrated scholar, physician, and benefactor, Sir William
Blowne (founder of a scholarship and the three gold
medals called after his name,) who replied to Dr. Trapp
in the following quaternion:       


The king to Oxford sent a troop of horse,
For Tories know no argument but force:
With equal grace, to Cambridge books he sent,
For Whigs allow no force but argument.


Not that Cambridge was behind Oxford in supporting the
unfortunate Charles the First, to whom the several colleges
secretly conveyed nearly all their ancient plate; and
Cromwell, in consequence, retaliated by confining and
depriving numbers of her most distinguished scholars, both
laymen and divines, many of whom died in exile: and the
commissioners of parliament, with a taste worthy of the
worst barbarians, caused many of the buildings to be despoiled
of their architectural ornaments and exquisite
pieces of sculpture and painted glass. It was at this time
appeared the following celebrated poetic trifle, extant in
the Oxford Sausage, known as


THE CUSHION PLOT,

Written by Herbert Beaver, Esq., of Corpus Christi College,
Oxford, when        Gaby        (as the then President, Dr.
Shaw, is called, who had been a zealous Jacobite,) suddenly,
on the accession of George the First, became a still
more zealous patron of the interests of the House of
Hanover.


When Gaby possession had got of the Hall,
He took a survey of the Chapel and all,
Since that, like the rest, was just ready to fall,
Which nobody can deny.

And first he began to examine the chest,
Where he found an old Cushion which gave him distaste;
The first of the kind that e       er troubled his rest,
Which nobody can deny.
[Pg 188]
Two letters of Gold on this Cushion were rear       d;
Two letters of gold once by Gaby rever       d,
But now what was loyalty, treason appear       d:
Which nobody can deny.

       J. R. (quoth the Don, in soliloquy bass)
       See the works of this damnable Jacobite race!
       We       ll out with the J, and put G in its place:       
Which nobody can deny.

And now to erase these letters so rich,
For scissors and bodkin his fingers did itch,
For Converts in politics go thorough-stich:
Which nobody can deny:

The thing was about as soon done as said,
Poor J was deposed and G reigned in his stead;
Such a quick revolution sure never was read!
Which nobody can deny.

Then hey for preferment       but how did he stare,
When convinced and ashamed of not being aware,
That J stood for Jennet,[11] for Raymond the R,
Which nobody can deny.

Then beware, all ye priests, from hence I advise,
How ye choose Christian names for the babes ye baptize,
For if Gaby don       t like        em he       ll pick out their I       s,
Which nobody can deny.

The benefactor who gave the college the Cushion.



Terr        Filius relates the following instance of


THE DANGER OF DRINKING THE KING       S HEALTH.

Mr. Carty of University College, and Mr. Meadowcourt
of Merton College, Oxford (says this writer,) were suspended
from proceeding to their next degree, in 1716, the
first for a period of one, the second for a period of two
years, the latter further, not to be permitted        to supplicate
for his grace, until he confesses his manifold crimes, and
asks pardon upon his knees, For breaking out to that degree
of impudence (when the Proctor admonished him to
go home from the tavern at an unseasonable hour,) as to
command all the company, with a loud voice, to drink King
[Pg 189]
George       s health.        And, strange enough,
persisting in his refusal to ask pardon, as required, he only ultimately
obtained his degree by pleading the act of grace of the said
King George, enacted in favour of those who had been
guilty of treason,      c. These were, it appears, both Fellows
of colleges, and with several others, who were likewise
put in the Black-book, were members of a society in
Oxford, called


       THE CONSTITUTION CLUB,       

At a meeting of which it was that the king was toasted.


AMONGST THE CAMBRIDGE CLUBS

Was one formed, in 1757, by the Wranglers of that year,
including the late Professor Waring; the celebrated reformer
Dr. Jebb the munificent founder of the Cambridge
Hebrew Scholarships; Mr. Tyrwhitt; and other learned
men. It was called The Hyson Club, the entertainments
being only tea and conversation. Paley, who joined it
after he became tutor of Christ College, is thus made to
speak of it by a writer in the New Monthly Magazine for
1825:              We had a club at Cambridge, of political reformers;
it was called the Hyson Club, as we met at tea
time; and various schemes were discussed among us.
Jebb       s plan was, that the people should meet and declare
their will; and if the House of Commons should pay due
attention to the will of the people, why, well and good; if
not, the people were to convey their will into effect. We
had no idea that we were talking treason. I was always
an advocate for braibery and corrooption: they raised an
outcry against me, and affected to think I was not in earnest.
       Why,        said I,        who is so mad as to wish to be governed
by force? or who is such a fool as to expect to be
governed by virtue? There remains, then, nothing but
braibery and corrooption.               No particular subjects were
proposed for discussion at their meetings, but accident or
the taste of individuals naturally led to topics, such as literary
and scientific characters might freely discuss. At a
meeting where the debate was on the justice or expediency
of making some alteration in the ecclesiastical constitution
[Pg 190]
of the country, for the relief of tender consciences, Dr.
Gordon, of Emmanuel College, late Precentor of Lincoln,
vehemently opposed the arguments of Dr. Jebb, then tutor
of Peter House, who supported the affirmative, by exclaiming,
       You mean, Sir, to impose upon us a new church government.       
       You are mistaken,        said Paley, who was
present,        Jebb only wants to ride his own horse, not to
force you to get up behind him.       



THE RETROGRADATION AMONGST MASTERS, TUTORS, AND SCHOLARS.

Discipline, like every thing else characteristic of our
elder institutions, has for some years been fast giving way
in our universities. Statutes are permitted to slumber unheeded,
as not fitted to the present advanced state of society;
and in colleges where it would, as late as the beginning
of the nineteenth century, have been almost a crime
to have been seen in hall or chapel without a white cravat
on, scholars now strut in black ones,        unawed by imposition       
or a fine. I can remember the time when this inroad
upon decent appearance first begun, and when the
Dean of our college put forth his strong arm, and insisted
on white having the preference. Men then used to wear
their black till they came to the hall or chapel door, then
take them off, and walk in with none at all, and again
twist them round the neck, heedless whether the tie were
Brummell or not, on issuing forth from Prayers or Commons.
Like the Whigs, they have by perseverance carried
their point, and strut about in black, wondering what
they shall next attempt.



THERE IS AN ON-DIT,

That at the time Dr. W               became Master of St. John       s
College, Cambridge, the tutors used to oblige (and it was
a custom for) the scholars to stand, cap in hand (if any
tutor entered a court where they might be passing,) till
the said tutor disappeared. This was so rigorously enforced,
[Pg 191]
that the scholars complained to the new master,
and he desired the tutors to relax the custom. This order
they refused to comply with. Upon this the Doctor took
down from a shelf a copy of the College Statutes, and coolly
read to them a section, where the fellows of the same were
enjoined to stand, cap in hand, till the master passed by,
wherever they met him; and the Doctor, it is added, insisted
upon its observance, on pain of ejection, till at length
the tutors gave way.



THE WORCESTER GOBLIN.

Foote the comedian was, in his youthful days, a student
of Worcester College, Oxford, under the care of the Provost,
Dr. Gower. The Doctor was a learned and amiable
man, but a pedant. The latter characteristic was soon
seized upon by the young satirist, as a source whereon to
turn his irresistible passion for wit and humour. The
church at this time belonging to Worcester College, fronted
a lane were cattle were turned out to graze, and (as
was then the case in many towns, and is still in some English
villages) the church porch was open, with the bell-ropes
suspended in the centre. Foote tied a wisp of hay
to one of them, and this was no sooner scented by the cattle
at night, than it was seized upon as a dainty morsel.
Tug, tug, went one and all, and        ding-dong        went the
bell at midnight, to the astonishment of the Doctor, the
sexton, the whole parish, and the inmates of the College.
The young wag kept up the joke for several successive
nights, and reports of ghosts, goblins, and frightful visions,
soon filled the imagination of old and young with alarm,
and many a simple man and maiden whisked past the
scene of midnight revel ere the moon had        filled her horns,       
struck with fear and trembling. The Doctor suspected
some trick. He, accordingly, engaged the Sexton to watch
with him for the detection of the culprit. They had not
long lain hid, under favour of a dark night, when        ding-dong       
went the bell again: both rushed from their hiding
places, and the sexton commenced the attack by seizing
[Pg 192]
the cow       s tail, exclaiming,               Tis a gentleman commoner,       I
have him by the tail of his gown!        The Doctor approached
on the opposite tack, and seized a horn with both
hands, crying,        No, no, you blockhead,        tis the postman,       I
have caught the rascal by his blowing-horn!        and both
bawled lustily for assistance, whilst the cow kicked and
flung to get free; but both held fast till lights were procured,
when the real offender stood revealed, and the laugh
of the whole town was turned upon the Doctor and his fellow-night-errant,
the Sexton.



RECORDS OF THE CAMBRIDGE TRIPOSES.

The Spoon, in the words of Lord Byron       s Don Juan,


                      The name by which we Cantabs please,
To dub the last of honours in degrees,       


is the annual subject for University mirth, and if not the
fountain, is certainly the very foundation of Cambridge
University honours: without the spoon, not a man in the
Tripos would have a leg to stand upon: in fact, it would
be a top without a bottom, minus the spoon. Yet        this
luckless wight,        says the compiler of the Cambridge Tart,
is annually a universal butt and laughing-stock of the
whole Senate-House. He is the last of those men who
take honours of his year, and is called a        junior optime,       
and notwithstanding his being superior to them all, the
lowest of the                                                   , or Gregarious Undistinguished
Bachelors, think themselves entitled to shoot their pointless
arrows against the        wooden spoon,        and to reiterate
the perennial remark, that,        wranglers        are born with
golden spoons in their mouths;        senior optimes        with silver
spoons;        junior optimes        with wooden spoons, and
the                                                    with leaden spoons in their mouths. It may
be here, however, observed, that it is unjust towards the
undistinguished bachelors to say that        he (the spoon) is
superior to them all.        He is generally a man who has
read hard, id est, has done his best, whilst the undistinguished
bachelors, it is well known, include many men of
[Pg 193]
considerable, even superior talents, but having no taste for
mathematics, have merely read sufficient to get a degree;
consequently have not done their best. The muse has
thus invoked


THE WOODEN SPOON.


When sage Mathesis calls her sons to fame,
The Senior Wrangler bears the highest name.
In academic honour richly deckt,
He challenges from all deserved respect.
But, if to visit friends he leaves his gown,
And flies in haste to cut a dash in town,
The wrangler       s title, little understood,
Suggests a man in disputation good;
And those of common talents cannot raise,
Their humble thoughts a wrangler       s mind to praise.
Such honours to an Englishman soon fade,
Like laurel wreaths, the victor       s brows that shade.
No such misfortune has that man to fear,
Whom fate ordains the last in fame       s career;
His honours fresh remain, and e       en descend
To soothe his family, or chosen friend.
And while he lives, he wields the boasted prize,
Whose value all can feel, the weak, the wise;
Displays in triumph his distinguished boon,
The solid honours of the Wooden Spoon!


That many have borne off this prize who might have
done better, is well known too. One learned Cantab in
that situation felt so assured of his fate, when it might have
been more honourable, had he been gifted with prudence
and perseverance, that on the morning when it is customary
to give out the honours, in the Senate House, in their
order of merit, he provided himself with a large wooden
spoon, and when there was a call from the gallery, for
       the spoon        (for then the Undergraduates were allowed
to express their likes and dislikes publicly, a custom now
suppressed,) he turned the shafts of ridicule aside by
thrusting the emblem of his honours up high over his head,       an
act that gained him no slight applause. Another
Cantab, of precisely the same grade as to talent, who was
second in the classical tripos of his year, gave a supper on
the occasion of the spoon being awarded to him, which
commenced with soup, each man being furnished with a
[Pg 194]
ponderous wooden spoon to lap it with. Another, now a
Fellow of Trinity College, who more than once bore off
the Porson prize, being in this place of honour, a wag nailed
a large wooden spoon to his door. Hundreds of other
tricks have been put upon the spoon, next to whom are       


THE POLL; OR,                                                   :

Which, said the great Bentley, in a sermon preached before
the University of Cambridge, on the 5th of November,
1715,        is a known expression in profane authors, opposed
sometimes,                                                              , to the wise, and ever denotes the most,
and generally the meanest of mankind.               Besides the
mirth devoted character,        (the wooden spoon,) says the
writer first quoted, there        are always a few, a chosen few,
a degree lower than the                                                   , constantly written down
alphabetically, who serve to exonerate the        wooden spoon,       
in part, from the ignominy of the day; and these undergo
various epithets, according to their accidental number. If
there was but one, he was called Bion, who carried all his
learning about him without the slightest inconvenience.
If there were two, they were dubbed the Scipios; Damon
and Pythias; Hercules and Atlas; Castor and Pollux. If
three, they were ad libitum, the three Graces; or the three
Furies; the Magi; or Noah, Daniel, and Job. If seven,
they were the seven Wise Men; or the Seven Wonders of
the World. If nine, they were the unfortunate Suitors of
the Muses. If twelve, they became the Apostles. If thirteen,
either they deserved a round dozen, or, like the
Americans, should bear thirteen stripes on their coat and
arms. Lastly, they were sometimes styled constant quantities,
and Martyrs; or the thirteenth was designated the
least of the Apostles; and, should there be a fourteenth,
he was unworthy to be called an Apostle!        An unknown
pen has immortalized the                                                   , by the following       


ODE TO THE UNAMBITIOUS AND UNDISTINGUISHED BACHELORS.

       Post tot naufragia tutus.              Virg.


Thrice happy ye, through toil and dangers past,
Who rest upon that peaceful shore,
[Pg 195]Where all your fagging is no more,
And gain the long-expected port at last.

Yours are the sweets, the ravishing delights,
To doze and snore upon your noontide beds;
No chapel-bell your peaceful sleep affrights,
No problems trouble now your empty heads.

Yet, if the heavenly muse is not mistaken,
And poets say the muse can rightly guess,
I fear, full many of you must confess
That you have barely saved your bacon.

Amidst th        appalling problematic war,
Where dire equations frown       d in dread array,
Ye never strove to find the arduous way,
To where proud Granta       s honours shine afar.

Within that dreadful mansion have ye stood,
When moderators glared with looks uncivil,
How often have ye d       d their souls, their blood,
And wished all mathematics at the devil!

But ah! what terrors on that fatal day
Your souls appall       d, when, to your stupid gaze,
Appear       d the biquadratic       s darken       d maze,
And problems ranged in horrible array!

Hard was the task, I ween, the labour great,
To the wish       d port to find your uncouth way       
How did ye toil, and fag, and fume, and fret,
And       what the bashful muse would blush to say.

But now your painful terrors all are o       er       
Cloth       d in the glories of a full-sleev       d gown,
Ye strut majestically up and down,
And now ye fag, and now ye fear no more.


But although many men of this class are not gifted with
that species of perception suited to mathematical studies,
however desirable it may be that the mind should be subject
to that best of all correctives, the abstruse sciences,
they are often possessed of what may be justly denominated
       great talents.        A remarkable instance of this fact
was manifested in the person of a late fellow of Trinity
(now no longer so              for conscience-sake,       ) who wrote a
tragedy whilst still a boy of sixteen or seventeen, that was
produced at Covent Garden with success, obtained the
only vacant Craven scholarship in his freshman       s year
[Pg 196]
(always considered a high test of classical ability,) and
carried off other classical university prizes. Yet he, when
he came to be examined for his degree, though he sat and
wrote out whole books of Homer from memory, he was unable
to go through the first problem of Euclid: for when
told that he must do something in mathematics, he wrote
down, after a fashion, the A       s and B       s, but without describing
the figure, a necessary accompaniment. Of the omission
he was reminded by the examiner              Oh! the picture,
you mean,        was his reply, and, drawing a triangle of a
true isosceles cut, instead of an equilateral one, he added
thereto, a la heraldique, by way of supporters, two ovals
of equal height, which completed his only mathematical
effort. His learning and talents, however, procured him
his degree and a fellowship. To others, mathematics are
an inexhaustible source of delight, and such a mind it was
that penned The Address to Mathematics, in        The Cambridge
Tart,        beginning       


       With thee, divine Mathesis, let me live!
Effuse source of evidence and truth!       


Porson gave a singular proof of his        fondness for Algebra,       
says the Sexagenarian, by composing an equation in
Greek, the original being comprised in one line. When
resident in college, he would frequently amuse himself by
sending to his friends scraps of Greek of a like character,
for solution. The purport of one was,        Find the value of
nothing.        The next time he met his friend, he addressed
him with,        Well, have you succeeded in finding the value
of nothing?               Yes,        replied his friend.        What is it?       
       Sixpence I gave the gyp for bringing your note,        was the
rejoinder.

The late Professor Vince meeting a fellow of St. John       s
College, Cambridge, the next morning after a high wind
had blown down several of the fine old trees in the walks,
some of three centuries        standing, he was addressed with,
       a terrible storm last night, Mr. Professor.               Yes,        he
replied,        it was


A RARE MATHEMATICAL WIND.       

       Mathematical wind!        exclaimed the other,        how so,
[Pg 197]
Doctor?               Why you see it has extracted a great many
roots!        A Johnian one day eating apple-pie by the side of
a Johnian fellow, an inveterate punster, he facetiously observed,


       HE WAS RAISING APPLE-PIE TO THE Tth POWER:       

Another fellow walking down the hall, after dinner, and
slipping some distance on smooth flags, looked over his
shoulder and observed to one following him              An inclined
plane.       

Another Cantab, when a student of Bene       t, now rector
of H              , Suffolk, sung his song of        divine Mathesis:              


Let mathematicians and geometricians
Talk of circles        and triangles        charms,
The figure I prize is a girl with bright eyes,
And the circle that       s formed by her arms.





THE CLASSICAL TRIPOS AND THE WOODEN WEDGE.

This class of Cambridge honours, for which none can
become candidates but those who have attained mathematical
distinction, was instituted by a Grace of the Senate,
in 1822. As its title implies, it is divided into three
classes. The first examination took place in 1824, when
the Cantabs were saved the labour of gestation, by
the last man in the third class being named Wedgewood,
which was transposed by some wag to wooden wedge       and
by that soubriquet, equivalent to the wooden spoon, all
men so circumstanced are now designated in the colloquial
phraseology of the University. It is but justice to Mr.
W. to add, however, that he also attained the high mathematical
distinction of eighth wrangler of his year. By the
same decree of the Senate


A PREVIOUS EXAMINATION

Was established at Cambridge (answering to the Oxford
       Little-go,       ) by which all students are required to undergo
an examination in Classics and Divinity, in the Lent
term of the second year of their residence. The successful
[Pg 198]
candidates are divided into two classes only: but there
is always a select few who are allowed to pass, after an
extra trial of skill: these are lumped at the end, and have
been designated        Elegant Extracts.        Some wag furnished
Jackson       s Oxford Journal with this


SYLLOGISTIC EXERCISE FOR THE LITTLE-GO MEN.


No cat has two tails.
A cat has one tail more than no cat.
Ergo       A cat has three tails.


The following song (in the true spirit of a non-reading man) is from
the pen of a learned seceding Cantab, the late Dr. John Disney, who,
after graduating at Peter-House, Cambridge, LL.B., and for some time
officiating as a minister of the Established Church, resigned a living
       for conscience sake,        and closed his career as Minister of the
Unitarian Chapel, in Essex-street, Strand:       


Come, my good College lads! and attend to my lays,
I       ll show you the folly of poring o       er books;
For all you get by it is mere empty praise,
Or a poor meagre fellowship, and sour looks.


Chorus.


Then lay by your books, lads, and never repine;
And cram not your attics,
With dry mathematics,
But moisten your clay with a bumper of wine.



The first of mechanics was old Archimedes,
Who play       d with Rome       s ships as we       d play cup and ball,
To play the same game I can       t see where the need is,
Or why we should fag mathematics at all.
Then lay by your books, lads,      c.

Great Newton found out the binomial law,
To raise X -|- Y to the power of B;
Found the distance of planets that he never saw,
And we most probably never shall see.
Then lay by your books, lads,      c.

Let Whiston and Ditton star-gazing enjoy,
And taste all the sweets mathematics can give;
Let us for our time find a better employ,
And knowing life       s sweets, let us learn how to live.
Then lay by your books, lads,      c.
[Pg 199]
These men ex absurdo, conclusions may draw,
Perpetual motion they never could find;
Not one of the set, lads, can balance a straw,
And longitude seeking is hunting the wind.
Then lay by your books, lads,      c.

If we study at all, let us study the means
To make ourselves friends, and to keep them when made;
Learn to value the blessings kind heaven ordains,
To make others happy, let that be our trade.


Finale.


Let each day be better than each day before,
Without pain or sorrow,
To-day or to-morrow,
May we live, my good lads, to see many days more.




A DREADFUL FIT OF RHEUMATISM.

Two Cantabs, brothers, named Whiter, one the learned
author of Etymologicum Magnum, the other an amiable
divine; both were remarkable, the one for being six, the
other about five feet in height. The taller was eccentric and
often absent in his habits, the other a wag. Both were invited
to the same party, and the taller being first ready,
slipped on the coat of the shorter, and wended his way
into a crowded room of fashionables, to whom his eccentricities
being familiar, they were not much surprised at
seeing him encased in a coat, the tail of which scarcely
reached his hips, whilst the sleeves ran short of his elbows;
in fact, it was a perfect strait jacket, and he had
not been long seated before he began to complain to every
body that he was suffering from a dreadful fit of rheumatism.
One or two suggested the tightness of his coat as
the cause of his pain; but he remained rheumatic in spite
of them, till his brother       s approach threw the whole party
into a fit of convulsive laughter, as he came sailing into
the room, his coat-tails sweeping the room, en traine, and
his arms performing the like service on either side, as he
exclaimed, to his astonished brother,        Why, Bob, you
have got my coat on!        Bob then discovered that his
friends        hints bordered on the truth, and the two exchanged
[Pg 200]
garments forthwith, to the amusement of all
present.



DR. PARR AN INGRATE.

The Doctor was once staying with the late great and
good Mr. Roscoe, when many of the most distinguished
Whigs were his guests also, out of compliment to whom
the Doctor forbore to indulge in his customary after-dinner
pipe. At length, when wine and words had circulated
briskly, and twilight began to set in, he insisted upon
mounting to his own room to have a whiff solus. Having
groped his way up stairs, somewhat exhausted with the
effort, he threw himself into what he took to be an arm-chair.
Suddenly the ears of the party were assailed with awful
moans and groans, as of some one in tribulation. Mr.
Roscoe hastened to learn the cause, and no sooner reached
the stairs        foot, than he heard the Doctor calling lustily for
his man John, adding, in more supplicatory accents,        Will
nobody help a Christian man in distress! Will nobody
help a Christian man in distress!        Mr. Roscoe mounted
to the rescue, but could not forbear a hearty laugh, as he
beheld Dr. P. locked in the close embrace of a large old-fashioned
grate, which he had mistaken for an arm-chair,
and from which he was in vain struggling to relieve himself.



MON DIEU       LE DIABLE.

When Robert the Devil was first produced at Paris,
and the opera going folk were on the qui vive for the
promised appearance of the Prince of Darkness, a certain
Cantab, the facial line of whose countenance bordered on
the demoniacal, went to see him make his bow to a Parisian
audience, and happened to enter the same loge from
whence a Parisian belle was anxiously watching the entr        e
of Monsieur Le Robert. Attracted by the creaking of
the loge door, on suddenly turning her head in its direction,
she caught a glimpse of our Cambridge friend, and was
[Pg 201]
so forcibly struck with the expression of his countenance,
that she went into hysterics, exclaiming,        Mon Dieu! Le
Diable!       



SOME CRITICAL CIVILITIES.

The famous editor of Demosthenes, John Taylor, D. D.
being accused of saying Bishop Warburton was no scholar,
denied it, but owned he always thought so. Upon this
Warburton called him        The Learned Dunce.        When
Parr, in the British Critic for 1795, called Porson        a
giant in literature,        and        a prodigy in intellect,        the
Professor took it in dudgeon, and said,        What right has
any one to tell the height of a man he cannot measure?       
A Dutch commentator having called Bentley        Egregius       
and                                        ,               What right, (said the Doctor) has that
fellow to quote me;        does he think that I will set my
pearls in his dunghill?        Baxter, in the second edition of
his Horace, said the great Bentley seemed to him        rather
to have buried Horace under a heap of rubbish than to
have illustrated him.        And

BENTLEY SAID OF JOSHUA BARNES,

Who, to please his religious wife, composed a Greek ode to prove King
Solomon wrote Homer       s Iliad, that he was

                                                                                                Asinus ad Lyram:       

Joshua replied, that they who said this of him had not understanding
enough to be poets, or wanted the                                                                                           .



SIR BUSICK AND SIR ISAAC AGAIN.

I have before spoken of these two Cambridge knights
and rival physicians, but there yet remains to be told of
them, that on their meeting each other, perchance, in the
street or the senate house, the latter addressing his rival
in an ironical speech of condolence, to the effect,        I regret
[Pg 202]
to hear you are ill, Sir Busick.               Sir, I sick!        (Sir Isaac)
retorted the wit,        I never was better in my life!        Many
of my readers have no doubt seen the anecdote of Voltaire       s
building a church, and causing to be engraved on
the front thereof, the vain record,

       Voltaire erexit hoc Templum Deo.       

A similar spirit seized a Mr. Cole of Cambridge, who
left money either to erect the church or the steeple of St.
Clement       s, in Bridge-street, of that town, on condition
that his name was placed on the front of it. The condition
was complied with to the letter, thus, by the tasteful
judgment of some Cambridge wag:       


COLE: DEUM.

An admirably turned pun, which, I may add, for the benefit
of my English readers, signifies, Worship God. I have
already noticed the mathematical        Pons Asinorum        of
our mother of Cambridge. One of her waggish sons has
likewise contrived, for their amusement, a classical Pons
Asinorum, known as


THE FRESHMAN       S PUZZLE.

I knew a Trinity man of absent habits, who actually,
after residing two years in college, having occasion to call
upon an old school fellow, a scholar of Bene       t (id est,
Corpus Christi College,) before it was rebuilt, was so little
acquainted with the localities of the university, that he
was obliged to inquire his way, though not two hundred
yards from Trinity. Such a man could scarcely be expected
to know, what most Cantabs do, that Qui Church,
which is situated about four miles from Cambridge,        rears
its head        in rural simplicity in the midst of the open fields,
seemingly without the        bills of mortality;        for not so
much as a cottage keeps it in countenance. This gave
occasion for a Cambridge wag to invent the following
puzzle:       

       Templum Qui      stat in agris,       

Which has caused many a freshman a sleepless night, who,
ignorant of the status Qui, has racked his brains to translate
the above, minus a Quod pro Qui.


[Pg 203]
A SLY HUMOURIST.

Edmund Gurnay, B.D., Fellow of Corpus Christi College,
Cambridge, in 1601, was a sly humourist. The
Master had a great desire to get the garden to himself,
and, either by threats or persuasion, get all the rest of the
fellows to resign their keys; but upon his application to
Gurnay, he absolutely refused to part with his right.        I
have got the other fellows        keys, quoth the master.        Then
pray, master, keep them, and you and I will shut them
all out.               Sir, I expect to be obliged; am I not your master?       
       Yes, sir (said Gurnay;) and am I not your fellow?       
At another time he was complained of to the bishop, for
refusing to wear the surplice, and was cited to appear
before him, and told, that he expected he should always
wear it; whereupon, he came home, and rode a journey
with it on. This reminds one of


A STORY OF A NOBLE OXONIAN,

Then Mr. afterwards Lord Lyttleton, to whom the epithet
of        Reprobus,        they say, might have been applied with
more justice than it was to the famous Saxon Bishop, St.
Wulstan, by the monks of his day. Humour was his
lordship       s natural element, and whilst resident at Christ
Church, Oxford, he dressed himself in a bright scarlet
hunting coat, top-boots and spurs, buckskin breeches,
     c., and putting his gown over all, presented himself
to the head of his college, who was a strict disciplinarian.
       Good God! Mr. Lyttleton,        exclaimed the
Dean,        this is not a dress fit to be seen in a college.               I
beg your pardon,        said the wag,        I thought myself in perfect
costume! Will you be pleased to tell me how I should
dress, Mr. Dean?        The dean was at this time Vice-Chancellor,
and happened to be in his robes of office.        You
should dress like me, Sir,        said the Doctor, referring to
his black coat, tights, knee-buckles, and silk stockings.
Mr. Lyttleton thanked him and left, but to the Doctor       s
astonishment, he the next day presented himself at the
Deanery, drest in Vice-Chancellor       s robes,      c., an exact
fac-simile of the dean himself, and when rebuked coolly
observed, that he had followed the dean       s directions to the
letter.


[Pg 204]
IT IS RELATED OF THE SAME OXFORD WAG,

That having a party to supper with him, and being anxious
to play the Dean some harmless trick, as his delight was
to annoy him, he seized a potato off the dish, stuck it on a
fork, and bolted off with it to the deanery, followed by
some of his boon companions. This was at one, two, or
three in the morning, when all the rest of the college, and
of course the Dean, were locked in the embrace of Somnus.
Mr. Lyttleton, however, resolving to have his joke,
began thundering away at the Dean       s knocker, till roused
at last, he put his head out at the window, and in a rage
demanded the wants of the applicant.        Do you think,
Mr. Dean,        said Mr. L., holding up to his view the forked
potato with the coolest effrontery imaginable;        Do you
think, Mr. Dean, that this is a potato fit to put upon a
gentleman       s table?        Dr. Westphalinge, Canon of Christ
Church, afterwards Bishop of Hereford, and one of the
Commissioners sent to Oxford to abolish Popish practices,
by Elizabeth, says Bishop Godwyn,


WAS A PERSON OF SUCH CONSUMMATE GRAVITY,

       That during a familiar acquaintance with him for many
years, he never once saw him laugh,                     Nunquam in
risum viderim solutum.        As an antidote to such eternal
gravity, I can scarcely do better than append the following
Aristophanic morsel, attributed to Porson, and cry
       Hold, enough!        Chorus of Printers        Imps              Enough!

NEW WORKS

LATELY PUBLISHED,
AND
PREPARING FOR PUBLICATION,
BY
E. L. CAREY       A. HART, PHILAD.




In Three Volumes, 12mo.
JACOB FAITHFUL;
OR, LIFE ON THE WATER.
COMPLETE.
By the Author of        Peter Simple,               King       s Own,             c.



       It is replete with amusement and oddity. Poor Jacob was born on the
water.        It was,        says he,        in a floating sort of a box, called a lighter, and
upon the river Thames, that I first smelt the mud.                     Baltimore Gazette.

       Equal in merit to Peter Simple, and perhaps even more entertaining,
are the adventures of Jacob Faithful, another of the whimsical creations
of Captain Marryatt       s prolific brain.              Saturday Courier.

       It is full of character and incident, and will, we doubt not, be a universal
favourite.              Lit. Gaz.






In Three Volumes, 12mo.
PETER SIMPLE;
OR, ADVENTURES OF A MIDSHIPMAN.
COMPLETE.
By the Author of the        King       s Own,               Naval Officer,             c.



       The quiet humour which pervades the work is irresistibly amusing,
and the fund of anecdote and description which it contains, entertaining.
The humour sometimes approaches to downright burlesque, and the incident
to extravagance, if not improbability; but, altogether, as a book of
amusement, it is excellent.              Baltimore Gazette.

       Those who are the most competent to judge, say that Captain Marryatt
is altogether superior to any other writer of naval sketches or descriptions,
living or dead.              N. Y. Commercial Advertiser.

       This is the best work that Captain Marryatt has produced.              Atlas.

              Peter Simple        is certainly the most amusing of Captain Marryatt       s
amusing novels; a species of picture quite unique; a class by themselves,
full of humour, truth, and graphic sketches.              Literary Gazette.

       This is an admirable work, and worthy of the noble service it is written
to illustrate.              Spectator.

TRAVELS TO BOKHARA,
AND VOYAGE UP THE INDUS.
BY LIEUT. BURNES.



       Mr. Burnes is the first European of modern times who has navigated
the Indus. Many years have passed since the English Library has been
enriched with a book of travels, in value at all comparable with this. Mr.
Burnes is evidently a man of strong and masculine talents, high spirit, and
elegant taste, well qualified to tread in the steps of our Malcolms and
Elphinstones.              London Quarterly Review.

       Though comparisons may be and often are odious, we do not think we
shall excite one resentful feeling, even among the travellers whose productions
we have reviewed during a course approaching twenty years, when we
say that so interesting a publication of that class as the present, has not fallen
under our notice.              London Literary Gazette.

       These volumes will make a stir in what an old writer calls the        wooden

opinions, and principles of our maritime government, not to be eagerly

By the Author of        The Naval Officer,               Peter Simple        etc.


       An excellent novel.              Edinburg Review.

       Captain Marryat may take his place at the head of the naval novelists
of the day.              United Service Journal.

       The adventures of the hero, through bold and stirring scenes, lose not a
jot of their interest to the last, while the naval descriptions of sights and
deeds on shipboard may be compared with any similar production of which
we have any knowledge.              Atlas.

       A very remarkable book, full of vigour, and characterized by incidents
of perfect originality, both as to conception and treatment. Few persons
will take up the book without going fairly through it to the catastrophe,
which startles the reader by its unexpected nature.              Literary Gazette.

       Replete with genius. The work will go far permanently to fix the
name of Captain Marryat among the most popular and successful writers
of fiction of the age.              Felix Farley       s Bristol Journal.

       A work, perhaps, not to be equalled in the whole round of romance,
for the tremendous power of its descriptions, for the awfulness of its subjects,
and for the brilliancy and variety of the colours with which they
are painted.              Spectator.

TOM CRINGLE       S LOG.

COMPLETE.

A NEW EDITION, REVISED AND CORRECTED.

       The scenes are chiefly nautical, and we can safely say that no author
of the present day, not even excepting our own Cooper, has surpassed him
in his element.              U. S. Gazette.

       The sketches are not only replete with entertainment, but useful, as
affording an accurate and vivid description of scenery, and of life and
manners in the West Indies.              Boston Traveller.

       We think none who have read this work will deny that the author is
the best nautical writer who has yet appeared. He is not Smollett, he is
not Cooper; but he is far superior to them both.              Boston Transcript.

       The scenes are chiefly nautical, and are described in a style of beauty
and interest never surpassed by any writer.              Baltimore Gazette.

       The author has been justly compared with Cooper, and many of his
sketches are in fact equal to any from the pen of our celebrated countryman.              Saturday
Evening Post.

       A pleasant but a marvellously strange and wild amalgamation of water
and earth is        Tom Cringle;        full of quips and cranks, and toils and
pranks. A fellow of fun and talent is he, with a prodigious taste for
yarns, long and short, old and new; never, or but seldom, carrying more
sail than ballast, and being a most delightful companion, both by land and
sea. We were fascinated with the talents of Tom when we met him in
our respected contemporary from the biting north. His Log was to us like
a wild breeze of ocean, fresh and health-giving, with now and then a dash
of the tearful, that summoned the sigh from our heart of hearts; but now
that the yarns are collected and fairly launched, we hail them as a source
of much gratification at this dull season. Tom Cringle and a Christmas
fire! may well join in the chorus of        Begones dull care!              The        Quenching
of the Torch        as one of the most pathetic descriptions we over read. The
       Scenes at Jamaica        are full of vigour. As a whole, we have no hesitation
in pronouncing        The Log        the most entertaining book of the season.
There has been a sort of Waverley mystery thrown over the authorship
of these charming papers; and though many have guessed the author, yet
we take unto ourselves the credit of much sagacity in imagining that we
only have solved the enigma:       there are passages in        Tom Cringle        that
we believe no living author except Professor Wilson himself could write;
snatches of pure, exalted, and poetic feeling, so truly Wilsonian, that we penciled
them as we read on, and said, There he is again, and again, and again;
to the very last chapter.              New Monthly Magazine.

CAVENDISH;

OR, THE PATRICIAN AT SEA.

The following Notice is from the pen of Mr. Bulwer.

       The peculiar characteristics of Captain Marryatt are shared by some
of his nautical brethren; and the author of        Cavendish        has evinced much
ability and very vigorous promise in the works that have issued from his
pen.       

       We should find it very difficult to be very angry with the        Patrician,       
even if he had fifty times his real number of faults, on account of the
jovial, easy, reckless, off-hand style of character that seems to belong
to him. Our sea portraits multiply so fast, and advance so rapidly in excellence,
that we become fastidious, and insist upon a likeness where
formerly we were contented with a caricature.        Cavendish        partakes of
both.... Into these thousand or rather ten thousand scrapes, we cannot
follow him, but the reader may, much to his advantage. The Navarine
narrative, in particular, will be read with an interest proportioned to the
truth and spirit with which it is told.              New Monthly Magazine.



[11]
New and cheap Edition, in Two Volumes, 12mo., of the

MEMOIRS OF VIDOCQ,

THE CELEBRATED AGENT OF THE FRENCH POLICE.

       But it is not our province or intention to enter into a discussion of the
veracity of Vidocq       s Memoirs: be they true or false; were they purely
fiction from the first chapter to the last, they would, from fertility of invention,
knowledge of human nature, and ease of style, rank only second
to the novels of Le Sage. The first volume is perhaps more replete with
interest, because the hero is the leading actor in every scene; but in the
subsequent portions, when he gives the narrative of others, we cannot but
admire the power and graphic talent of the author. Sergeant Bellerose is
scarcely inferior to the Sergeant Kite of Farquhar and the episodes of
Court and Raoul, and that of Adele d       Escara, are surpassed in description,
depth of feeling, and pathos, by no work of romance with which we are
acquainted.       

From the Boston Traveller.

       Memoirs of Vidocq.       He who reads this book, being previously unacquainted
with the mystery of iniquity, will find himself introduced at
once into a new world: but it is a world which must be known only to
be avoided. Never before was such a mass of depravity opened to the
mind of inquiry in a single volume. It was well said by Byron,        truth
is strange, stranger than fiction.        Whoever passes through the details of
this singular exposition, supposing it to contain correct delineations of
fact, will be satisfied of the justness of this remark.

       The details of the varied scenes through which he has passed in private
and public life, surpass all the creations of fancy, and all the delineations
of fact, from the wonderful relations of the Arabian Nights to the
renowned exploits of Mr. Lemuel Gulliver; and from the extraordinary
sufferings and escapes of the celebrated Baron Trenck to the still more
marvellous exploits of the famous Mr. Thomas Thumb.

       It would seem, on following this singular writer through his adventures,
as if all the crimes of which human nature is capable, all the horrors
of which the universe has heard, all the astonishing incidents which
history can dovelop or imagination portray, all the cold-blooded malice
of the assassin, and all the varied machinations of the most ingenious and
systematic practitioners in the school of vice, in all its varied departments,
had been crowded into the life of a single individual, or come
beneath his cognizance. The lover of mystery, who delights to        sup upon
horrors,        the admirer of romance, who is pleased with the heightened pictures
of the most fanciful imagination, and the inquirer into the policy
of crime and its prevention, may here have their utmost curiosity satiated.

       Vidocq, during the early portion of his life, was personally initiated
into all the mysteries of crime, and becoming afterward a pardoned man,
and an active and successful agent of the French police in the city of Paris,
       girt with its silent crimes,        as well as its tumultuous depravities, becomes
a fit person to delineate its scenes of vice, depravity, and guilt.
His work is a study for the novelist, the annalist, the philosopher, and the
Christian. But it is a work which should be read with a guarded mind;
with it disposition to profit by its lessons, and to avoid scenes which have
little enjoyment, and which invariably end in misery.

       This is a fashionable novel, and of the highest grade.              Athen       um.

       Mrs. Gore is undeniably one of the wittiest writers of the present day.
       The Hamiltons        is a most lively, clever, and entertaining work.              Lit. Gaz.

       The design of the book is new, and the execution excellent.              Exam.

TOUGH YARNS;

A SERIES OF NAVAL TALES AND SKETCHES, TO PLEASE
ALL HANDS, FROM THE SWABS ON THE SHOULDER
DOWN TO THE SWABS IN THE HEAD.

BY THE OLD SAILOR.

       Here, most placable reader, is a title for thee, pregnant with fun, and
deeply prophetic of humour, drollery, and all those joyous emotions that
so opportunely come to oil the springs of the overworn heart, and prevent
the cankering and rust from wearing them away and utterly destroying their
healthful elasticity.              Metropolitan.

       The Old Sailor paints sea scenes with vigour and gusto; now-and-then
reminding us of        Tom Cringle,        and with a strong sense of the comical that
approaches Smollet.              Spectator.

       Here we have the        Old Sailor        once more, and in all his glory too! The
public will join with us in hailing the reappearance of the        old        boy. He
stands at the head of the naval humorists of the nineteenth century. We
have rarely seen an affair so richly humorous: it is one of the most amusing
and best written volumes of naval fiction we have ever seen.              Observer.

THE COQUETTE.

By the Author of        Miserrimus.       

       The        Coquette        is a most amusing library book. Several of the characters
are exceedingly well drawn: indeed, they are obviously sketches
from life, and there is a sparkling vivacity throughout the whole work.              New
Monthly Magazine.

THE MISERIES OF MARRIAGE;
OR, THE FAIR OF MAY FAIR.

By the Author of        Pin Money,             c.

       Mrs. Gore certainly stands at the head of the female novelists of the
day. But we subjoin the opinion of Mr. Bulwer.              U. S. Gazette.

       She is the consummator of that undefinable species of wit, which we
should call (if we did not know the word might be deemed offensive, in
which sense we do not mean it) the slang of good society.

       But few people ever painted, with so felicitous a hand, the scenery of
worldly life, without any apparent satire. She brings before you the hollowness,
the man      uvres, and the intrigues of the world, with the brilliancy
of sarcasm, but with the quiet of simple narrative. Her men and
women, in her graver tales, are of a noble and costly clay; their objects
are great; their minds are large, their passions intense and pure. She
walks upon the stage of the world of fashion, and her characters, have
grown dwarfed as if by enchantment. The air of frivolity has blighted
their stature; their colours are pale and languid; they have no generous
ambition; they are little people! they are fine people! This it is that makes
her novel of our social life so natural, and so clear a transcript of the
original.              The Author of Pelham.

MEMOIRS OF THE
BEAUTIES OF THE COURT
OF CHARLES THE SECOND.

BY MRS. JAMESON.

Author of        Diary of an Ennuyee,               Characteristics
of Women,             c.

       New work.       Messrs. Carey       Hart, Philadelphia, have in press a popular
book,        The Beauties of the Court of King Charles the Second,        written
by Mrs. Jameson, whose father had been employed by the princess Charlotte
to paint cabinet pictures of those too celebrated ladies. The princess
died before they were completed, and the consequence was, they were
never paid for. The circumstances of the family required some use should
be made of the paintings to produce a remuneration; and Mrs. Jameson
undertook the delicate task of the letter press, the portraits being engraved
in the highest style of art. The London copy costs about twenty-five dollars:
the American edition will be an octavo without the portraits. Nell
Gwynn, the Duchess of Hamilton,      c. are not unknown characters in history.
Mrs. Jameson has executed her department in a remarkably graceful
manner.              Journal of Belles Lettres.




MEMOIRS OF
GREAT MILITARY COMMANDERS

BY G. R. P. JAMES,

Author of        Darnley,               Henry Masterton,             c.

Including Henry V. of England; John, Duke of Bedford; Gonzales
de Cordova; Ferdinand, Duke of Alva; Oliver Cromwell;
Marshal Turenne; The Great Cond        ; General Monk; Duke
of Albemarle; Duke of Marlborough; The Earl of Peterborough;
Marquess of Granby; General Wolfe,      c.      c.

       That Mr. James should have been eminently successful in portraying
the lives of illustrious military commanders is not surprising; for it is well
known that martial achievements have long been his favourite study.              Morning
Post.

       A more interesting series of memoirs could not be presented to the
curiosity of readers, inasmuch as in the lives of such men romantic adventures
of the most exciting kind co-exist with the strictest truth.              Courier.

TRAITS AND STORIES OF THE
IRISH PEASANTRY

FIRST SERIES.

       Admirable       truly, intensely Irish: never were the outrageous whimsicalities
of that strange, wild, imaginative people so characteristically described;
nor amidst all the fun, frolic, and folly, is there any dearth of
poetry, pathos, and passion. The author       s a jewel.              Glasgow Journal.

       To those who have a relish for a few titbits of rale Irish story-telling,       whether
partaking of the tender or the facetious, or the grotesque,       let
them purchase these characteristic sketches.              Sheffield Iris.

       The sister country has never furnished such sterling genius, such irresistibly
humorous, yet faithful sketches of character among the lower ranks
of Patlanders, as are to be met with in the pages of these delightful volumes.              Bristol
Journal.

       This is a capital book, full of fun and humour, and most characteristically
Irish.              New Monthly Magazine.

       Neither Miss Edgeworth, nor the author of the O       Hara Tales, could have

TRAITS AND STORIES OF THE
IRISH PEASANTRY.

THIRD SERIES.

       This work has been most extravagantly praised by the English critics:
and several extracts from it have been extensively published in our newspapers.
It is altogether a better work than any of the kind which has
yet appeared       replete with humour, both broad and delicate       and with
occasional touches of pathos, which have not been excelled by any writer
of the present day. An Edinburgh critic says that        neither Miss Edgeworth,
nor the author of the O       Hara tales, could have written any thing
more powerful than this.                     Baltimore American.

PIN MONEY;

By MRS. CHARLES GORE,

Authoress of        Hungarian Tales,               Polish Tales,        etc.

       Her writings have that originality which wit gives to reality, and wit
is the great characteristic of her pages.              Bulwer       s New Monthly Magazine.

       Light spirited and clever, the characters are drawn with truth and
vigour. Keen in observation, lively in detail, and with a peculiar and
piquant style, Mrs. Charles Gore gives to the novel that charm which
makes the fascination of the best French memoir writers.              London Literary

MAKANNA;
OR, THE LAND OF THE SAVAGE.

       One of the most interesting and graphic romances it has been our lot
to read for many a year.              Athen       um.

       There was yet an untrodden land for the writer of fiction, and the
author of        Makanna        is its discoverer.              Atlas.

       The narrative includes some daring adventures which would make
timid blood shudder at their magnitude.... This work abounds in interest
and is written in a style of great vigour and elegance.              Weekly Times.

       The work does not want to be invested with any fictitious interest;
end the talent which is visible in its pages is its best recommendation to
public favour.              Morning Post.

       The attempt was a bold and hazardous one, but it has been fully successful.
We have rarely read a production of deeper interest       of interest
sustained from the first page to the last. It has been conceived in a fine
spirit; the several characters are ably painted.... He is as much at home
on the ocean, and there are many scenes on ship-board equal to the best
of the great sea-lord, the author of        The Spy.                     New Monthly Magazine.

THE GENTLEMAN IN BLACK.

       It is very clever and very entertaining       replete with pleasantry and
humour: quite as imaginative as any German diablerie, and far more
amusing than most productions of its class. It is a very whimsical and
well devised jeu d       esprit.              Literary Gazette.

FIVE NIGHTS OF ST. ALBANS.

       Some man of talent has taken up the old story of the Wandering Jew,
to try what he could make of a new version of it. He has succeeded in
composing as pretty a piece of diablerie as ever made candles burn blue at
midnight. The horrors of Der Freischutz are mere child       s play compared
with the terrors of the Old Man or the demon Amaimon; and yet all the
thinking and talking portion of the book is as shrewd and sharp as the
gladiatorial dialogues of Shakspeare       s comedies.              Spectator.

       A romance, called the        Five Nights of St. Albans,        has just appeared,
which combines an extraordinary power of description with an enchaining
interest. It is just such a romance as we should imagine Martin, the
painter, would write; and, to say the truth, the description of supernatural
effects in the book, fall very little short in their operation upon different
senses of the magical illusions of the talented artist.              John Bull.

FRANCESCA CARRARA.

BY L. E. L.

Author of        The Improvisatrice,               Romance and Reality,             c.

       But in prose she lives with us: now sanctifying; now satirizing; now
glittering with the French in their most brilliant court, playing with diamonds
and revelling in wit; then reposing on one of the finest creations that human
genius ever called into existence       the holy friendship of Guido and Francesca.
The whole range of modern fiction offers nothing like the portraiture
of these two cousins; it is at once beautiful and sublime, and yet perfectly
natural and true.              New Monthly Magazine.

       A sparkling and brilliant performance. The observations on life and
society have all the acuteness of Le Sage.              Literary Gazette.

       A book of remarkable power and genius; unquestionably superior to
any other production of the present time, with the single exception of the
writings of the author of        The Last Days of Pompeii.                     Examiner.

       A novel it is of beauty, grace, eloquence, noble thoughts, and tender
feelings, such as none but a lady       and a lady of exquisite genius, too       could
write.              Fraser       s Magazine.

PRINCIPLES OF THE
ART OF MODERN HORSEMANSHIP
FOR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

IN WHICH ALL THE LATE IMPROVEMENTS ARE APPLIED TO PRACTICE.

Translated from the French, by Daniel J. Desmond.

The Art of Horsemanship.       This is the title of a neat little work
translated from the French of Mr. Lebeaud, by Daniel J. Desmond, Esq.
of this city, and just published by Carey       Hart. It gives full and explicit
directions for breaking and managing a horse, and goes into detail on the
proper mode of mounting, the posture in the saddle, the treatment of the
animal under exercise,      c. An appendix is added, containing instructions
for the ladies, in mounting and dismounting.

The Philadelphia public are under obligations to Mr. Desmond for this
translation. We have long needed a manual of horsemanship, to correct
the inelegant habits in which many of our riders indulge, and to produce
uniformity in the art of equitation. We see daily in our streets, mounted
men, who totter in their seats as if suffering under an ague-fit; others
who whip, spur, and rant, as if charging an enemy in battle; and again
others, of slovenly habits, with cramped knees, and toes projecting outwards,
who occupy a position utterly devoid of every thing like ease,
grace, or beauty. These things are discreditable to our community, and
earnestly do we hope, that this book will have many attentive readers.       Philadelphia

to have been very successfully attained in the present volume.

and is in general conveyed in accurate and concise terms. To
THE ENGINEER, THE ARCHITECT, THE MECHANIC       indeed to all
for whom results are chiefly necessary       the work will doubtless form a
very valuable acquisition.

It gives me pleasure to say that the elementary work on Surgery, by
M. Bourgery, and now under translation by Drs. Roberts and Kissam of
New York, appears to me well calculated for the use of students. So far as
I can judge from examination of a small portion of the English text, justice
has been done by the translators to the author of the work.

Dear Sirs,

I have examined Bourgery       s manual, or work on Lesser Surgery, and
am of opinion that it is an excellent compend, which contains a great deal
of matter that will be useful to students. The translation which you are
about to make, will deserve a large edition, and I have no doubt will meet
with a ready sale.

Yours truly,
GEO. M       CLELLAN.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
