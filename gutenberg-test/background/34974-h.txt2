NOTICE OF THE AUTHOR.


The Reverend Nathaniel Ward, the writer of the following
work, was born at Haverhill, England, in 1570. Of
this town his father was a clergyman. He was educated at
Cambridge, studied and practised law, travelled on the Continent,
afterwards commenced the study of divinity, became
a preacher of the Gospel, and was settled at Standon, in
Hertfordshire. He was a strong friend of the early settlers
of New England before the elder Winthrop's coming over.
At a General Court of the Massachusetts Company, held
in London, on Wednesday the 25th of November, 1629,
"Mr. Whyte did recom      end Mr. Nathaniel Ward of Standon"
to be admitted to the freedom of the Company. He
was ordered before the Bishop, Dec. 12, 1631, to answer
for his non-conformity. Being forbidden to preach, he embarked
in April, 1634, for this country. He arrived here
in June, and was settled as Pastor of the church at Ipswich,
[Pg 3]or Aggawam, the same year. By reason of indisposition,
he was, at his own request, in 1636, released from his engagement
with the church there. However thus disengaged,
he preached often during the time he remained in the
colony. The necessities of the infant Commonwealth called
for his time, talents, and acquirements. Nor did he
refuse. Willing to do the good, which he might, he lent a
ready and efficient hand to the formation of our Legal Code.
He was appointed by the General Court, March 12, 1638,
on a committee to draw up a system of laws, for the consideration
of the freemen. The same legislative authority,
May 13, 1640, granted him six hundred acres of land for
his service, at Pentucket, afterwards called Haverhill. He
preached the election sermon, 1641, in which he advanced
several things that savored more of liberty, than some of
the magistrates were prepared to approve. The same year,
Oct. 7, "The Govern'r and mr Hauthorne were Desired
to speake to mr Ward, for a coppey of the liberties, and of
the Capitall lawes to bee transcribed, and sent to the severall
townes." He wrote the "Simple Cobler" in 1645. In
this year, May 25, he was on a committee to draw up a
Body of Liberties, which were published in 1648, being the
first printed volume of the kind in this Colony. Though
greatly assisted by Joseph Hills and others in the composition
and arrangement of so important a work, yet he appears
to have been a principal agent in its accomplishment.
He sold his interest at Haverhill, Nov. 25, 1646, to John
Eaton, for        12,00. Between this date and the 6th of January
following, he returned to England. On June 30th,
1647, he preached before the House of Commons, and the
[Pg 4]same year published the "Simple Cobler." He was afterwards
settled in the ministry at Shenfield, near Brentwood,
where he died in 1653, in his eighty-third year.

Fuller, in his "Worthies of England," speaking of him,
says, that he, "following the counsel of the poet,


Ridentem dicere verum,
Quis vetat?



What doth forbid but one may smile,
And also tell the truth the while?


hath in a jesting way, in some of his books, delivered much
smart truth of the present times." Dr. Mather, in his
"Magnalia," remarks of him, "he was the author of many
composures full of wit and sense; among which, that entituled
The Simple Cobler (which demonstrated him to be a
subtil statesman) was most considered." The same author
adds, that "some famous persons of old thought it a greater
glory to have it enquired; why such a one had not a
statue erected for him? than to have it enquired why he
had? If it be enquired, why this our St. Hilary hath among
our Lives no statue erected for him? let that enquiry go for
part of one." And in the "Remarkables" of Increase
Mather, he observes, "An hundred witty Speeches of our
Celebrated Ward, who called himself The Simple Cobler
of Agawam, [and over whose Mantel-piece in his House, by
the way, I have seen those three Words Engraved, SOBRIE,
JUSTE, PIE, and a Fourth added, which was L       TE:]
have been reported; but he had one Godly Speech, that
was worth 'em all; which was, I have only Two Comforts to[Pg 5]
Live upon; The one is in the Perfections of CHRIST;
The other is in The Imperfections of all CHRISTIANS."

Mr. Ward had several children. Among them, were
John, settled in the ministry at Haverhill, Mass., where he
died, 1693; James, who practised medicine; and a daughter,
married to Gyles Fyrmin. These three last accompanied
their father to England.

To illustrate how much Mr. Ward benevolently labored
for the public good with but small recompense, we quote
another remark of Cotton Mather, as to his son John. It
follows: "He was a son most exemplarily dutiful unto his
parents; and having paid some considerable debts for his
father, he would afterwards humbly observe and confess,
that God had abundantly recompenced this his dutifulness."
Whether these debts were paid in Old or New England is
uncertain.

Thus we have given a sketch of one, who deserves well
of New England and of friends to freedom every where,       so
that it might be more evident how he and the subsequent
work were estimated by his contemporaries and successors.

NOTE.

This work passed through several editions at London
in 1647. It was reprinted in Boston in 1713.
One of the earlier editions and that of 1713 have
been used in preparing the present edition for the
press. After his first impression, the author made
several additions to succeeding ones, which will be
found in this now issued.       The principal of these
additions are as follow: "A Word of Love to the
Common People of England," "A most humble Heel
piece,"      c., and "A respective word to the Ministers
of England."

THE
SIMPLE COBLER
OF
Aggawam in America.


Either I am in an Appoplexie, or that man
is in a Lethargie, who doth not now sensibly
feele God shaking the Heavens over
his head, and the Earth under his feet:
The Heavens so, as the Sun begins to turne
into darknesse, the Moon into blood, the
Starres to fall down to the ground; So that little Light
of Comfort or Counsell is left to the sonnes of men:
The Earth so, as the foundations are failing, the
righteous scarce know where to finde rest, the Inhabitants
stagger like drunken men; it is in a manner
dissolved both in Religions and Relations: And no
marvell; for, they have defiled it by transgressing
the Laws, changing the Ordinances, and breaking the
Everlasting Covenant. The Truths of God are the
Pillars of the world, whereon States and Churches
may stand quiet if they will; if they will not, He
can easily shake them off into delusions, and distractions
enough.

Sathan is now in his passions, hee feeles his passion
approaching; hee loves to fish in royled waters.
Though that Dragon cannot sting the vitals of the[Pg 9]
Elect mortally, yet that Beelzebub can fly-blow their
Intellectuals miserably: The finer Religion grows,
the finer hee spins his Cobwebs, hee will hold pace
with Christ so long as his wits will serve him. Hee
sees himselfe beaten out of grosse Idolatries, Heresies,
Ceremonies, where the Light breakes forth with power;
he will therefore bestirre him to prevaricate Evangelicall
Truths, and Ordinances, that if they will
needs be walking, yet they shall laborare varicibus,
and not keep their path: he will put them out of time
and place; Assascinating for his Engineers, men of
Paracelsian parts; well complexioned for honesty;
for, such are fittest to Mountebanke his Chimistry
into sicke Churches and weake Judgements.

Nor shall hee neede to stretch his strength overmuch
in this worke: Too many men having not laid their
foundation sure, nor ballasted their Spirits deepe with
humility and feare, are prest enough of themselves to
evaporate their owne apprehensions. Those that are
acquainted with Story know, it hath ever been so in
new Editions of Churches: Such as are least able,
are most busie to pudder in the rubbish, and to raise
dust in the eyes of more steady Repayrers. Civill
Commotions make roome for uncivill practises: Religious
mutations, for irreligious opinions: Change of
Aire, discovers corrupt bodies; Reformation of Religion,
unsound mindes. He that hath any well-faced
phancy in his Crowne, and doth not vent it now, fears
the pride of his owne heart will dub him dunce for
ever. Such a one will trouble the whole Israel of
God with his most untimely births, though he makes[Pg 10]
the bones of his vanity sticke up, to the view and
griefe of all that are godly wise. The devill desires
no better sport then to see light heads handle their
heels, and fetch their carreers in a time, when the
Roofe of Liberty stands open.

The next perplexed Question, with pious and ponderous
men, will be: What should bee done for the
healing of these comfortlesse exulcerations. I am the
unablest adviser of a thousand, the unworthiest of
ten thousand; yet I hope I may presume to assert
what follows without just offence.

First, such as have given or taken any unfriendly
reports of us New-English, should do well to recollect
themselves. We have beene reputed a Colluvies
of wild Opinionists, swarmed into a remote wildernes
to find elbow-roome for our phanatick Doctrines
and practises: I trust our diligence past, and constant
sedulity against such persons and courses, will plead
better things for us. I dare take upon me, to bee the
Herauld of New-England so farre, as to proclaime to
the world, in the name of our Colony, that all Familists,
Antinomians, Anabaptists, and other Enthusiasts,
shall have free Liberty to keep away from us, and
such as will come to be gone as fast as they can, the
sooner the better.

Secondly, I dare averre, that God doth no where
in his word tolerate Christian States, to give Tolerations
to such adversaries of his Truth, if they have
power in their hands to suppresse them.

Here is lately brought us an extract of a Magna
Charta, so called, compiled between the Sub-planters[Pg 11]
of a West-Indian Island; whereof the first Article of
constipulation, firmely provides free stable-room and
litter for all kinde of consciences, be they never so
dirty or jadish; making it actionable, yea, treasonable,
to disturbe any man in his Religion, or to discommend
it, whatever it be. Wee are very sorry to
see such professed profanenesse in English Professors,
as industriously to lay their Religious Foundations
on the ruine of true Religion; which strictly
binds every conscience to contend earnestly for the
Truth: to preserve unity of spirit, faith and Ordinances,
to be all like-minded, of one accord; every man
to take his brother into his Christian care: to stand
fast with one spirit, with one mind, striving together
for the faith of the Gospel: and by no meanes to permit
Heresies or erroneous opinions: But God abhorring
such loathsome beverages, hath in his righteous judgement
blasted that enterprize, which might otherwise
have prospered well, for ought I know; I presume
their case is generally knowne ere this.

If the devill might have his free option, I believe
he would ask nothing else, but liberty to enfranchize
all false Religions, and to embondage the true; nor
should he need: It is much to bee feared, that laxe
Tolerations upon State pretences and planting necessities,
will be the next subtle Stratagem he will spread,
to distate the Truth of God and supplant the peace of
the Churches. Tolerations in things tolerable, exquisitely
drawn out by the lines of the Scripture, and
pensill of the Spirit, are the sacred favours of Truth,
the due latitudes of Love, the faire Compartiments of[Pg 12]
Christian fraternity: but irregular dispensations, dealt
forth by the facilities of men, are the frontiers of errour,
the redoubts of Schisme, the perillous irritaments
of carnall and spirituall enmity.

My heart hath naturally detested foure things:
The standing of the Apocrypha in the Bible; Forrainers
dwelling in my Countrey, to crowd our native
Subjects into the corners of the Earth; Alchymized
coines; Tolerations of divers Religions, or of one
Religion in segregant shapes: He that willingly assents
to the last, if he examines his heart by day-light,
his conscience will tell him, he is either an Atheist,
or an Heretique, or an Hypocrite, or at best a captive
to some lust: Poly-piety is the greatest impiety in
the world. True Religion is Ignis probationis, which
doth congregare homogenea       segregare heterogenea.

Not to tolerate things meerly indifferent to weak
consciences, argues a conscience too strong: pressed
uniformity in these, causes much disunity: To tolerate
more than indifferents, is not to deale indifferently
with God; He that doth it, takes his Scepter out
of his hand, and bids him stand by. Who hath to
doe to institute Religion but God. The power of all
Religion and Ordinances, lies in their purity: their
purity in their simplicity: then are mixtures pernicious.
I lived in a City, where a Papist preached in
one Church, a Lutheran in another, a Calvinist in a
third; a Lutheran one part of the day, a Calvinist the
other, in the same Pulpit: the Religion of that place
was but motly and meagre, their affections Leopardlike.

If the whole Creature should conspire to doe the[Pg 13]
Creator a mischiefe, or offer him an insolency, it
would be in nothing more, than in erecting untruths
against his Truth, or by sophisticating his Truths
with humane medleyes; the removing of some one
iota in Scripture, may draw out all the life, and traverse
all the Truth of the whole Bible: but to authorise
an untruth, by a Toleration of State, is to build a
Sconce against the walls of heaven, to batter God out
of his Chaire: To tell a practicall lye, is a great sin,
but yet transient; but to set up a Theoricall untruth,
is to warrant every lye that lies from its root to the
top of every branch it hath, which are not a few.

I would willingly hope that no Member of the
Parliament hath skilfully ingratiated himselfe into the
hearts of the House, that he might watch a time to
midwife out some ungracious Toleration for his own
turne, and for the sake of that, some others. I would
also hope that a word of generall caution should not
be particularly misapplied. I am the freer to suggest
it, because I know not one man of that mind, my
aime is generall, and I desire may be so accepted. Yet
good Gentlemen, looke well about you, and remember
how Tiberius plaid the Fox with the Senate of Rome,
and how Fabius Maximus cropt his ears for his cunning.

That State is wise, that will improve all paines and
patience rather to compose, then tolerate differences in
Religion. There is no divine Truth, but hath much
Celestial fire in it from the Spirit of Truth: nor no
irreligious untruth, without its proportion of Antifire
from the Spirit of Error to contradict it: the zeale of[Pg 14]
the one, the virulency of the other, must necessarily
kindle Combustions. Fiery diseases seated in the
spirit, embroile the whole frame of the body: others
more externall and coole, are lesse dangerous. They
which divide in Religion divide in God; they who
divide in him, divide beyond Genus Generalissimum,
where there is no reconciliation, without atonement;
that is, without uniting in him, who is One, and in
his Truth, which is also one.

Wise are those men who will be perswaded rather
to live within the pale of Truth where they may bee
quiet, than in the purliev's, where they are sure to be
hunted ever and anon, doe Authority what it can.
Every singular Opinion, hath a singular opinion of it
self; and he that holds it a singular opinion of himself,
and a simple opinion of all contra-sentients: he
that confutes them, must confute all three at once, or
else he does nothing; which will not be done without
more stir than the peace of the State or Church
can indure.

And prudent are those Christians, that will rather
give what may be given, then hazzard all by yeelding
nothing. To sell all peace of Country, to buy some
peace of Conscience unseasonably, is more avarice
than thrift, imprudence than patience: they deale not
equally, that set any truth of God at such a rate; but
they deale wisely that will stay till the Market is fallen.

My prognosticks deceive me not a little, if once
within three seven years, peace prove not such a penny-worth
at most Marts in Christendome, that hee
that would not lay down his money, his lust, his opin[Pg 15]ion,
his will, I had almost said the best flower of his
Crown for it, while he might have had it; will tell
his own heart, he plaid the very ill husband.

Concerning Tolerations I may further assert.

That Persecution of True Religion, and Toleration
of false, are the Jannes and Jambres to the Kingdome
of Christ, whereof the last is farre the worst. Augustines
tongue had not owed his mouth one penny-rent
though it had never spake one word more in it, but
this, Nullum malum pejus libertate errandi.

Frederick Duke of Saxon, spake not one foote beyond
the mark when he said, he had rather the Earth
should swallow him up quick, then he should give a
toleration to any opinion against any truth of God.

He that is willing to tolerate any Religion, or discrepant
way of Religion, besides his own, unlesse it
be in matters meerly indifferent, either doubts of his
own, or is not sincere in it.

He that is willing to tolerate any unsound Opinion,
that his own may also be tolerated, though never so
sound, will for a need hang Gods Bible at the Devils
girdle.

Every Toleration of false Religions, or Opinions
hath as many Errours and sins in it, as all the false
Religions and Opinions it tolerates, and one sound
one more.

That State that will give Liberty of Conscience in
matters of Religion, must give Liberty of Conscience
and Conversation in their Morall Laws, or else the
Fiddle will be out of tune, and some of the strings
cracke.[Pg 16]

He that will rather make an irreligious quarrell with
other Religions, then try the truth of his own by valuable
Arguments, and peaceable Sufferings; either his
Religion, or himselfe is irreligious.

Experience will teach Churches and Christians,
that it is farre better to live in a State united, though
a little Corrupt, then in a State, whereof some Part
is incorrupt, and all the rest divided.

I am not altogether ignorant of the eight Rules
given by Orthodox Divines about giving Tolerations,
yet with their favour I dare affirme,

That there is no Rule given by God for any State
to give an Affirmative Toleration to any false Religion,
or Opinion whatsoever; they must connive in
some cases, but may not concede in any.

That the State of England (so farre as my Intelligence
serves) might in time have prevented with ease,
and may yet without any great difficulty deny both
Toleration, and irregular Connivences, salva Republica.

That if the State of England shall either willingly
Tolerate, or weakly connive at such Courses, the
Church of that Kingdom will sooner become the Devills
Dancing-Schoole, then Gods-Temple; The Civill
State a Beare-garden, then an Exchange: The whole
Realme a Pais base, then an England. And what
pity it is, that that Country which hath been the Staple
of Truth to all Christendome, should now become
the Aviary of Errors to the whole World, let every
fearing heart judge.

I take Liberty of Conscience to bee nothing but a[Pg 17]
freedome from sinne, and error. Conscientia in tantum
libera, in quantum ab errore liberata. And liberty
of Error nothing but a Prison for Conscience.
Then small will bee the kindnesse of a State to build
such Prisons for their Subjects.

The Scripture saith, there is nothing makes free but
Truth, and Truth saith, there is no Truth but One:
If the States of the World would make it their sumoperous
Care to preserve this One Truth in its purity
and Authority it would ease them of all other Political
cares. I am sure Satan makes it his grand, if not
onely taske, to adulterate Truth; Falshood is his
sole Scepter, whereby he first ruffled, and ever since
ruined the World.

If Truth be but One, me thinks all the Opinionists
in England should not be all in that One Truth, some
of them I doubt are out. He that can extract an
unity out of such a disparity, or contract such a disparity
into an unity; had need be a better Artist, then
ever was Drebell.

If two Centers (as we may suppose) be in one Circle,
and lines drawn from both to all the points of the
Compasse, they will certainly crosse one another, and
probably cut through the Centers themselves.

There is talke of an universall Toleration, I would
talke as loud as I could against it, did I know what
more apt and reasonable Sacrifice England could offer
to God for his late performing all his heavenly
Truths, then an universall Toleration of all hellish Errors,
or how they shall make an universall Reformation,
but by making Christs Academy the Devils Uni[Pg 18]versity,
where any man may commence Heretique
per saltum; where he that is filius Diabolicus, or
simpliciter pessimus, may have his grace to goe to
hell cum Publico Privilegio; and carry as many after
him, as he can.

Religio docenda est, non coercenda is a pretty piece
of album Latinum for some kinde of throats that are
willingly sore, but H       resis dedocenda est non permittenda,
will be found a farre better Diamoron for the
Gargarismes this Age wants, if timely and throughly
applyed.

In a word room for Hell above ground.

[1] By Brownists I mean not Independents, but dew-clawd Seperatists:
farre be it from me to wrong godly Independents. I truely
acknowledge that I judge my self neither able nor worthy to honour
some of them as they deserve.[Pg 19]

It is said, Though a man have light enough himselfe
to see the Truth, yet if he hath not enough to
enlighten others, he is bound to tolerate them, I will
engage my self, that all the Devills in Britanie shall
sell themselves to their shirts, to purchase a Lease of
this Position for three of their Lives, under the Seale
of the Parliament.

It is said, That Men ought to have Liberty of their
Conscience, and that it is Persecution to debarre them
of it: I can rather stand amazed then reply to this:
it is an astonishment to think that the braines of men
should be parboyl'd in such impious ignorance; Let
all the wits under the Heavens lay their heads together
and finde an Assertion worse than this (one excepted)
I will Petition to be chosen the universal Ideot of
the world.

It is said, That Civill Magistrates ought not to meddle
with Ecclesiasticall matters.

I would answer to this so well as I could, did I not
know that some Papers lately brought out of New-England,
are going to the Presse, wherein the Opinions
of the Elders there in a late Synod, concerning
this point are manifested, which I suppose will give
clearer satisfaction then I can.

The true English of all this their false Latine, is nothing
but a generall Toleration of all Opinions; which
motion if it be like to take, it were very requisite,
that the City would repaire Pauls with all the speed
they can, for an English Pantheon, and bestow it
upon the Sectaries, freely to assemble in, then there
may be some hope that London will be quiet in time.[Pg 20]

But why dwell I so intolerable long about Tolerations,
I hope my feares are but panick, against which
I have a double cordiall. First, that the Parliament
will not though they could: Secondly, that they cannot
though they would grant such Tolerations. God
who hath so honoured them with eminent wisdome
in all other things, will not suffer them to cast both
his, and their Honour in the dust of perpetuall Infamy,
doe what they can; nor shall those who have spent
so great a part of their substance in redeeming their
Civill Liberties from Usurpation, lose all that remaines
in enthralling their spirituall Liberty by Toleration.

It is said Opinionists are many, and strong, that de
sunt Vires, that it is turbata respublica, I am very
sorry for it, but more sorry, if despondency of minde
shall cause the least tergiversation in Gods Worthies,
who have receiv'd such pledges of his presence in
their late Counsels, and Conflicts. It is not thousands
of Opinionists that can pinion his Everlasting armes, I
can hardly beleeve there is a greater unbeleever then
my Selfe, yet I can verily beleeve that the God of
Truth will in a short time scatter them all like smoake
before the wind. I confesse I am troubled to see Men
so over-troubled about them; I am rather glad to
heare the Devill is breaking up house in England, and
removing somewhither else, give him leave to sell all
his rags, and odde-ends by the out-cry; and let his
petty Chapmen make their Market while they may,
upon my poore credit it will not last long. Hee that
hath done so much for England will go on to perfect
his owne praise, and his Peoples Peace: let good[Pg 21]
men stand still, and behold his further Salvation. He
that sitteth in the Heavens laughs at them, the most
High hath them in Derision, and their folly shall certainly
be manifested to all men.

Yet I dare not but adde, and in the Name of God
will adde, that if any Publique members of Church or
State, have been either open fautors, or private abetters
of any blasphemous, contagious Opinions; It will be
their wisdome to proportion their repentance to their
Sin, before God makes them Publique monuments of
Ignominie, and Apostasie.

Thirdly, That all Christian States, ought to disavow
and decry all such Errours, by some peremptory
Statutary Act, and that in time, that Subjects knowing
fully the minde of the State, might not delude
themselves with vaine hopes of unsufferable Liberties.
It is lesse to say Statuatur veritas, ruat Regnum, than
Fiat justitia, ruat C       lum; but there is no such danger
in either of them. Feare nothing Gentlemen,
Rubiconem transiistis, jacta est alea, ye have turned
the Devill out of doores; fling all his old parrell after
him out at the windows, lest he makes an errand for
it againe. Qu        relinquuntur in morbis post indicationem,
recidivas facere consuevere. Christ would have
his Church without spot or wrinckle; They that help
make it so, shall lose neither honour nor labour: If
yee be wise, suffer no more thorns in his sides or your
owne. When God kindles such fires as these, hee
doth not usually quench them, till the very scum on
the pot sides be boyled cleane away, Ezek. 24. 10,
[Pg 22]11. Yee were better to doe it your selves, then leave
it to him: the Arme of the Lord is mighty, his hand
very heavy; who can dwell with his devouring fire,
and long lasting burnings?

Fourthly, to make speedy provision against Obstinates
and disseminaries: where under favour, two
things will be found requisite. First, variety of penaltyes,
I meane certaine, not indefinite: I am a Crabbat
against Arbitrary Government. Experience hath
taught us here, that politicall, domesticall, and personall
respects, will not admit one and the same remedy
for all, without sad inconveniences. Secondly, just
severity: persecution hath ever spread Truth, prosecution
scattered Errour: Ten of the most Christian
Emperors, found that way best; Schollars know whom
I meane: Five of the ancient Fathers perswaded to it,
of whom Augustine was one, who for a time argued
hard for indulgency: but upon conference with other
prudent Bishops, altered his judgement, as appears in
three of his Epistles, to Marcellinus, Donatus, and
Boniface. I would be understood, not onely an Allower,
but an humble Petitioner, that ignorant and
tender conscienced Anabaptists may have due time
and means of conviction.

Fifthly, That every Prophet, to whom God hath
given the tongue of the learned, should teach, and
every Angel who hath a pen and inkehorne by his
side write against these grieving extravagancies:
writing of many books, I grant is irkesome, reading
endlesse. A reasonable man would thinke Divines
had declaimed sufficiently upon these Themes. I have
ever thought the Rule given, Titus 3. 10. which cuts[Pg 23]
the work short and sharpe to be more properly prevalent,
then wearisome waiting upon unweariable Spirits.
It is a most toylsome taske to run the wild-goose
chase after a well-breath'd Opinionist: they delight
in vitilitigation: it is an itch that loves a life to be
scrub'd: they desire not satisfaction, but satisdiction,
whereof themselves must be judges: yet in new eruptions
of Error with new objections, silence is sinfull.

As for my selfe, I am none of the disputers of this
world: all I can doe, is to guesse when men speake
true or false divinity: if I can but finde the parentall
roote, or formall reason of a Truth, I am quiet; if I
cannot, I shore up my slender judgement as long as
I can, with two or three the handsomest props I can
get: I shall therefore leave Arguments to acuter
heads, and onely speak a word of Love, with all
Christian respect to our deare Brethren in England,
which are against baptizing of Infants: I intreate them
to consider these few things seriously and meekly.
First, what a high pitch of boldnesse it is for man to
cut a principall Ordinance out of the Kingdome of God;
if it be but to make a dislocation, which so far disgoods
the Ordinance, I feare it altogether unhallows
it, to transplace or transtime a stated Institution of
Christ, without his direction, I thinke, is to destroy
it. Secondly, what a Cruelty it is to devest children
of that onely externall priviledge which their heavenly
Father hath bequeathed them, to interest them visibly
in Himselfe, His Son, His Spirit, His Covenant of
Grace, and the tender bosome of their carefull Mother
the Church. Thirdly, what an Inhumanity it is, to[Pg 24]
deprive Parents of that comfort they may take from
the baptisme of their Infants dying in their Childehood.
Fourthly, How unseasonable and unkindely it is, to
interturbe the State and Church with these Amalekitish
onsets, when they are in their extreame pangs of
travell with their lives. Fifthly, to take a through
view of those who have preambled this by path.
Being sometimes in the Crowds of foraigne Wederdopers,
that is, Anabaptists; and prying into their inward
frames with the best eyes I had; I could not but observe
these disguised guises in the generality of them.

First, a flat formality of Spirit without salt or savour
in the spiritualties of Christ, as if their Religion
began and ended in their Opinion. Secondly, a shallow
slighting of such as dissent from them, appearing
too often in their faces, speeches and carriages. Thirdly,
a feeble, yet peremptory obstinacy; seldome are
any of them reclaimed. Fourthly, a shamefull sliding
into other such tarpauling tenets, to keep themselves
dry from the showers of Justice, as a rationall minde
would never entertain, if it were not Errour-blasted
from Heaven and Hell: I should as shrewdly suspect
that Opinion, that will cordially corrive with two or
three sottish errours, as that faith that can professedly
live with two or three sordid sins. I dare not feare
our godly Brethren in England to be yet comming to
this passe; how soon they may, themselves know not,
the times are slippery: They will undoubtedly finde
God as jealous of his Ordinances, as themselves are
zealous of their Opinions.

Sixthly, That Authority ought to see their Sub[Pg 25]jects
children baptized, though their Parents judgements
be against it, if there be no other Evangelicall
barre in the way.

Seventhly, That prudent men, especially young,
should doe well not to ingage themselves in conference
with Errorists, without a good calling and great caution;
their breath is contagious, their leprey spreading:
receive not him that is weak, saith the Apostle, to
doubtfull disputations; much lesse may they run
themselves into dangerous Sophistications. He usually
hears best in their meetings, that stops his eares closest;
he opens his mouth to best purpose, that keeps it
shut, and he doeth best of all, that declines their company
as wisely as he may.

Brethren, have an extraordinary care also of the
late Theosophers, that teach men to climbe to Heaven
upon a ladder of lying figments. Rather than the
Devill will lose his game, he will out-shoot Christ in
his owne bow; he will out-law the Law, quite out of
the word and world: over-Gospell the Gospell, and
quidanye Christ, with Sugar and Rats-bane. Hee
was Professour not long since at Schelstat in Alsatia,
where he learned that no poyson is so deadly as the
poyson of Grace.

The wisest way, when all is said, is with all humility
and feare, to take Christ as himselfe hath revealed
himselfe in his Gospel, and not as the Devill presents
him to prestigiated phansies. I have ever hated the
way of the Rosie-Crucians, who reject things as Gods
wisedome hath tempered them, and will have nothing
but their Spirits. If I were to give physick to Spryts,[Pg 26]
I would doe so too: but when I want physick for my
body, I would not have my soule tartared: nor my
Animall Spirits purged any way, but by my Naturall,
and those by my bodily humours, and those by such
Ordinaries, as have the nearest vicinage to them, and
not by Metaphysicall Limbeckings. I cannot thinke
that materia prima or secunda, should be good for
me, that am at least, Materia millessima sexcentesima
quadragesima quinta.

Here I hold my selfe bound to set up a Beacon, to
give warning of a new-sprung Sect of Phrantasticks,
which would perswade themselves and others, that
they have discovered the Nor-west passage to Heaven.
These wits of the game, cry up and downe in
corners such bold ignotions of a new Gospell, new
Christ, new Faith, and new gay-nothings, as trouble
unsetled heads, querulous hearts, and not a little
grieve the Spirit of God. I desire all good men may
be saved from their Lunatick Creed, by Infidelity; and
rather beleeve these torrid overtures will prove in
time, nothing but horrid raptures downe to the lowest
hell, from which he that would be delivered, let him
avoid these blasphemers, a late fry of croaking Frogs,
not to be indured in a Religious State, no, if it were
possible, not an houre.

As some are playing young Spaniels, questing at
every bird that rises; so others, held very good men,
are at a dead stand, not knowing what to doe or say;
and are therefore called Seekers, looking for new
Nuntio's from Christ, to assoile these benighted questions,
and to give new Orders for new Churches. I[Pg 27]
crave leave with all respect to tell them, that if they
looke into Act. 20. 20. 25. Gal. 1. 8. 9. 1. Tim. 6.
13. 16. and find them not there; they may happily
seeke as the young Prophets did for Eliah's corps,
where it never was, nor ever will be found.

I cannot imagine why the Holy Ghost should give
Timothy the solemnest charge, was ever given mortall
man, to observe the Rules he had given, till the
comming of Christ, if new things must be expected.

Woe be to them, who ever they be, that so trouble
the wayes of God that they who have found the way
to Heaven, cannot find the way to Church: And woe
be to them, that so gaze at the glorious light, they say,
will breake forth in the thousand yeares to come, that
they make little of the gracious Truth that hath been
revealed these sixteen hundred years past. And woe
be to them that so under-value the first Master-Builders,
I mean the Apostles of Christ, that unlesse he
sends wiser than they, He must be accounted lesse
faithfull in his house than Moses was.

I have cause enough to be as charitable to others
as any man living; yet I cannot but feare, that those
men never Moored their Anchors well in the firme
soile of Heaven, that are weather-waft up and down
with every eddy-wind of every new doctrine. The
good Spirit of God doth not usually tie up the Helme,
and suffer passengers to Heaven to ride a drift, hither
and thither, as every wave and current carries them:
that is a fitter course for such as the Apostle calls
wandring Starres and Meteors, without any certaine
motion, hurryed about with tempests, bred of the Ex[Pg 28]halations
of their own pride and self-wittednesse:
whose damnation sleepeth not, and to whom the mist
of darknesse is reserved for ever, that they may suffer
irreparable shipwrack upon the Sands and Rocks
of their owne Errours, being of old ordained to condemnation.

Eightly, let all considerate men beware of ungrounded
opinions in Religion: Since I knew what to feare,
my timerous heart hath dreaded three things: a blazing
starre appearing in the aire: a State Comet, I
mean a favourite rising in a Kingdome, a new Opinion
spreading in Religion: these are Exorbitancies:
which is a formidable word: a vacuum and an exorbitancy,
are mundicidious evils. Concerning Novelties
of opinions; I shall expresse my thoughts in these
briefe passages. First, that Truth is the best boone
God ever gave the world: there is nothing in the
world, any further then Truth makes it so; it
is better then any creat' Ens or Bonum, which are but
Truths twins. Secondly, the least Truth of Gods
Kingdome, doth in its place, uphold the whole kingdome
of his Truths; Take away the least vericulum
out of the world, and it unworlds all, potentially, and
may unravell the whole texture actually, if it be not
conserved by an Arme of superiordinary power. Thirdly,
the least Evangelicall Truth is more worth than
all the Civil Truths in the world, that are meerly so.
Fourthly, that Truth is the Parent of all Liberty
whether politicall or personall; so much untruth, so
much thraldome, John 8. 32.

Hence it is, that God is so jealous of his Truths, that[Pg 29]
he hath taken order in his due justice: First, that no
practicall sin is so sinfull as some errour in judgement;
no men so accursed with indelible infamie and dedolent
impenitency, as Authours of Heresie. Secondly,
that the least Error, if grown sturdy and pressed,
shall set open the Spittle-doore of all the squint ey'd,
wry-necked, and brazen-faced Errors that are or ever
were of that litter; if they be not enough to serve its
turne, it will beget more, though it hath not one crust
of reason to maintain them. Thirdly, that that State
which will permit Errors in Religion, shall admit Errors
in policy unavoyably. Fourthly, that that Policy
which will suffer irreligious Errors, shall suffer the
losse of so much Liberty in one kind or other, I will
not exempt Venice, Rhaguse, the Cantons, the Nether-lands,
or any.

An easie head may soon demonstrate, that the pre-mentioned
Planters, by Tolerating all Religions, had
immazed themselves in the most intolerable confusions
and inextricable thraldomes the world ever heard
of. I am perswaded the Devill himselfe was never
willing with their proceedings, for feare it would
breake his wind and wits to attend such a Province.
I speak it seriously according to my meaning. How
all Religions should enjoy their Liberty, Justice its
due regularity, Civill cohabitation morall honesty, in
one and the same Jurisdiction, is beyond the Artique
of my comprehension. If the whole conclave of Hell
can so compromise, exadverse, and diametricall contradictions,
as to compolitize such a multimonstrous
maufrey of heteroclytes and quicquidlibets quietly;[Pg 30]
I trust I may say with all humble reverence, they can
doe more then the Senate of Heaven. My modus loquendi
pardoned: I intirely wish much welfare and
more wisdom to that Plantation.

It is greatly to be lamented, to observe the wanton
fearlessnesse of this Age, especially of younger professors,
to greet new opinions and Opinionists: as if
former truths were grown superannuate, and saplesse,
if not altogether antiquate. Non senescet veritas. No
man ever saw a gray haire on the head or beard of any
Truth, wrinckle, or morphew on its face: The bed
of Truth is green all the yeare long. Hee that cannot
solace himselfe with any saving truth, as affectionately
as at the first acquaintance with it, hath not only
a fastidious, but an adulterous heart.

If all be true we heare, Never was any People under
the Sun, so sick of new Opinions as English-men
nor of new fashions as English-women: If God helpe
not the one, and the devill leave not helping the other,
a blind man may easily foresee what will become
of both. I have spoken what I intend for the present
to men; I shall speak a word to the women anon:
in the mean time I intreat them to prepare patience.

Ninthly, that godly humble Christians ought not
to wonder impatiently at the wonderfull workes of
God in these times: it is full Season for him to work
Soveraign worke, to vindicate his Soveraignty, that
men may feare before him. States are unstated, Rulers
growne Over-rulers, Subjects worse then men,
Churches decayed. Tofts, Professors, empty casks
filled with unholy humours; I speake not of all, but[Pg 31]
too many; I condemne not the generation of the just:
God hath his remnant, whom he will carefully preserve.
If it bee time for men to take up Defensive
Armes against such as are called Gods, upon the point
of Salus populi, it is high time for him that is God
indeed, to draw his Sword against wormes and no
men, upon the point of Majestas imperii: The piercing
of his Sword shall discover the thoughts of many
hearts.

Lastly, I dare averre, that it ill becomes Christians
any thing well-shod with the preparation of the Gospel,
to meditate flight from their deare Countrey upon
these disturbances. Stand your ground ye Eleazars
and Shammahs, stir not a foot so long as you have
halfe a foot of ground to stand upon: after one or
two such Worthies, a great Victory may be regained,
and flying Israel may returne to a rich spoile.
Englishmen, be advised to love England, with your
hearts and to preserve it by your Prayers. I am bold
to say that since the pure Primitive time, the Gospel
never thrived so well in any soile on earth, as in the
British; nor is the like goodnesse of nature, or Cornucopian
plenty else-where to be found: if ye lose
that Country, and finde a better before ye come to
Heaven, my Cosmography fades me. I am farre
from discouraging any, whom necessity of Conscience
or condition thrusts out by head and shoulders:
if God calls any into a Wildernesse, Hee will be no
wildernesse to them, Jer. 2. 31. witnesse his large beneficence
to us here beyond expectation.[Pg 32]

Ye say, why come not we over to help the Lord
against the Mighty, in these Sacred battailes?

I answer, many here are diligently observing the
counsell of the same Prophet, 22. 10. Weepe not for
him that is dead, neither bemoan him; but weep for
him that is gone away and shall returne no more to
see his Native Country. Divers make it an Article
of our American Creed, which a celebrate Divine of
England hath observed upon Heb. 11. 9. That no
man ought to forsake his owne countrey, but upon extraordinary
cause, and when that cause ceaseth, he is
bound in conscience to returne if he can: We are looking
to him who hath our hopes and seasons in his
onely wise hand.

In the mean time we desire to bow our knees before
the Throne of Grace day and night, that the Lord
would be pleased in his tender mercy to still the sad
unquietnesse and per-peracute contentions, of that
most comfortable and renowned island, that at length
He may have praise in his Churches, and his Churches
peace in him, through Jesus Christ.



Should I not keepe promise in speaking a little
to Womens fashions, they would take it unkindly:
I was loath to pester better matter with such
stuffe; I rather thought it meet to let them stand by
themselves, like the Qu        Genus in the Grammar,
being Deficients, or Redundants, not to be brought
under any Rule: I shall therefore make bold for this
once, to borrow a little of their loose tongued Liberty,
and mispend a word or two upon their long-wast[Pg 33]ed,
but short-skirted patience: a little use of my
stirrup will doe no harme.


Ridentem dicere verum, quid prohibet?



Gray Gravity it selfe can well beteam,
That Language be adapted to the Theme.
He that to Parrots speaks, must parrotize:
He that instructs a foole, may act th' unwise.


It is known more then enough, that I am neither
Nigard, nor Cinick, to the due bravery of the true
Gentry: if any man mislikes a bully mong drossock
more then I, let him take her for his labour: I honour
the woman that can honour her selfe with her attire:
a good Text alwayes deserves a fair Margent: I am
not much offended if I see a trimme, far trimmer than
she that wears it: in a word, whatever Christianity or
Civility will allow, I can afford with London measure:
but when I heare a nugiperous Gentledame inquire
what dresse the Queen is in this week: what the
nudiustertian fashion of the Court; I meane the very
newest: with egge to be in it in all haste, what ever
it be; I look at her as the very gizzard of a trifle, the
product of a quarter of a cypher, the epitome of nothing,
fitter to be kickt, if shee were of a kickable substance,
than either honour'd or humour'd.

To speak moderately, I truly confesse, it is beyond
the ken of my understanding to conceive, how
those women should have any true grace, or valuable
vertue, that have so little wit, as to disfigure
themselves with such exotick garbes, as not only dismantles
their native lovely lustre, but transclouts[Pg 34]
them into gant bar-geese, ill-shapen-shotten-shell-fish,
Egyptian Hyeroglyphicks, or at the best into French
flurts of the pastery, which a proper English woman
should scorne with her heels: it is no marvell they
weare drailes on the hinder part of their heads, having
nothing as it seems in the fore-part, but a few
Squirrils brains to help them frisk from ill-favor'd
fashion to another.


These whimm' Crown'd shees, these fashion-fansying wits,
Are empty thin brain'd shells, and fiddling Kits.


The very troublers and impoverishers of mankind,
I can hardly forbear to commend to the world a saying
of a Lady living sometime with the Queen of
Bohemia, I know not where shee found it, but it is
pitty it should be lost.


The World is full of care, much like unto a bubble;
Women and care, and care and women, and women and care and trouble.


The Verses are even enough for such odde pegma's.
I can make my selfe sicke at any time, with
comparing the dazling splender wherewith our Gentlewomen
were embellished in some former habits,
with the gut-foundred goosdom, wherewith they are
now surcingled and debauched. Wee have about five
or six of them in our Colony: if I see any of them
accidentally, I cannot cleanse my phansie of them for
a moneth after. I have been a solitary widdower almost
twelve yeares, purposed lately to make a step
over to my Native Country for a yoke-fellow: but[Pg 35]
when I consider how women there have tripe-wifed
themselves with their cladments, I have no heart to
the voyage, least their nauseous shapes and the Sea,
should work too sorely upon my stomach. I speak sadly;
me thinkes it should breake the hearts of English-men
to see so many goodly English-women imprisoned
in French Cages, peering out of their hood-holes
for some men of mercy to help them with a little
wit, and no body relieves them.

It is a more common then convenient saying, that
nine Taylors make a man: it were well if nineteene
could make a woman to her minde: if Taylors were
men indeed, well furnished but with meer morall
principles, they would disdain to be led about like
Apes, by such mymick Marmosets. It is a most unworthy
thing, for men that have bones in them, to
spend their lives in making fidle-cases for futilous
womens phansies; which are the very pettitoes of infirmity,
the gyblets of perquisquilian toyes. I am so
charitable to think, that most of that mystery would
worke the cheerfuller while they live, if they might
bee well discharged of the tyring slavery of mis-tyring
women: it is no little labour to be continually putting
up English-women into Out-landish caskes: who
if they be not shifted anew, once in a few moneths,
grow too sowre for their Husbands. What this Trade
will answer for themselves when God shall take measure
of Taylors consciences is beyond my skill to
imagine. There was a time when


The joyning of the Red-Rose with the White,
Did set our State into a Damask plight.
[Pg 36]

But now our Roses are turned to Flore de lices,
our Carnations to Tulips, our Gilliflowers to Dayzes,
our City-Dames, to an indenominable Qu       malry of
overturcas'd things. Hee that makes Coates for the
Moone, had need take measure every noone; and he
that makes for women, as often, to keepe them from
Lunacy.

I have often heard divers Ladies vent loud feminine
complaints of the wearisome varieties and chargable
changes of fashions: I marvell themselves preferre
not a Bill of redresse. I would[2] Essex Ladies
would lead the Chore, for the honour of their County
and persons; or rather the thrice honourable Ladies
of the Court, whom it best beseemes: who may wel
presume of a Le Roy le veult from our sober King, a
Les Seigneurs ont Assentus from our prudent Peers,
and the like Assentus from our considerate, I dare not
say wife-worne Commons: who I beleeve had much
rather passe one such Bill, than pay so many Taylors
Bills as they are forced to doe.

[2] All the Counties and shires of England have had wars in them
since the Conquest, but Essex, which is onely free, and should be
thankfull.

Most deare and unparallel'd Ladies, be pleased to
attempt it: as you have the precellency of the women
of the world for beauty and feature; so assume the
honour to give, and not take Law from any, in matter
of attire: if ye can transact so faire a motion among
yourselves unanimously, I dare say, they that most
renite, will least repent. What greater honour can[Pg 37]
your Honors desire, then to build a Promontory president
to all foraigne Ladies, to deserve so eminently at
the hands of all the English Gentry present and to
come: and to confute the opinion of all the wise men
in the world; who never thought it possible for women
to doe so good a work?

If any man think I have spoken rather merrily
than seriously he is much mistaken, I have written
what I write with all the indignation I can, and no
more then I ought. I confesse I veer'd my tongue to
this kinde of Language de industria though unwillingly,
supposing those I speak to are uncapable of
grave and rationall arguments.

I desire all Ladies and Gentlewomen to understand
that all this while I intend not such as through necessary
modesty to avoyd morose singularity, follow
fashions slowly, a flight shot or two off, shewing by
their moderation, that they rather draw countermont
with their hearts, then put on by their examples.

I point my pen only against the light-heel'd beagles
that lead the chase so fast, that they run all civility
out of breath, against these Ape-headed pullets,
which invent Antique foole-fangles, meerly for fashion
and novelty sake.

In a word, if I begin once to declaime against fashions,
let men and women look well about them, there
is somewhat in the businesse; I confesse to the world,
I never had grace enough to be strict in that kinde;
and of late years, I have found syrrope of pride very
wholesome in a due Dos, which makes mee keep such
store of that drugge by me, that if any body comes[Pg 38]
to me for a question-full or two about fashions, they
never complain of me for giving them hard measure,
or under-weight.

But I addresse my self to those who can both hear
and mend all if they please: I seriously feare, if the
pious Parliament doe not finde a time to state fashions,
as ancient Parliaments have done in some part,
God will hardly finde a time to state Religion or
Peace: They are the surquedryes of pride, the wantonnesse
of idlenesse, provoking sins, the certain prodromies
of assured judgement, Zeph. 1. 7, 8.

It is beyond all account, how many Gentlemens
and Citizens estates are deplumed by their feather-headed
wives, what usefull supplies the pannage of
England would afford other Countries, what rich returnes
to it selfe, if it were not slic'd out into male
and female fripperies: and what a multitude of misimploy'd
hands, might be better improv'd in some more
manly Manufactures for the publique weale: it is not
easily credible, what may be said of the preterpluralities
of Taylors in London: I have heard an honest
man say, that not long since there were numbered between
Temple-barre and Charing-Crosse, eight thousand
of that Trade: let it be conjectured by that
proportion how many there are in and about London,
and in all England, they will appeare to be very
numerous. If the Parliament would please to mend
women, which their Husbands dare not doe, there
need not so many men to make and mend as there
are. I hope the present dolefull estate of the Realme,
will perswade more strongly to some considerate
course herein, than I now can.[Pg 39]

Knew I how to bring it in, I would speak a word
to long haire, whereof I will say no more but this:
if God proves not such a Barbor to it as he threatens,
unlesse it be amended, Esa. 7. 20. before the Peace of
the State and Church be well setled, then let my
prophesie be scorned, as a sound minde scornes the
ryot of that sin, and more it needs not. If those who
are tearmed Rattle-heads and Impuritans, would take
up a Resolution to begin in moderation of haire, to
the just reproach of those that are called Puritans and
Round-heads, I would honour their manlinesse, as
much as the others godlinesse, so long as I knew what
man or honour meant: if neither can find a Barbours
shop, let them turne in, to Psal. 68. 21. Jer. 7. 29.
1 Cor. 11. 14. if it be thought no wisdome in men
to distinguish themselves in the field by the Scissers,
let it bee thought no injustice in God, not to distinguish
them by the Sword. I had rather God should
know me by my sobriety, than mine enemy not know
me by my vanity. He is ill kept, that is kept by his
owne sin. A short promise is a farre safer guard than a
long lock: it is an ill distinction which God is loth to
looke at, and his Angels cannot know his Saints by.
Though it be not the mark of the Beast, yet it may be
the mark of a beast prepared to slaughter. I am sure
men use not to weare such manes; I am also sure
Souldiers use to weare other marklets or notadoes in
time of battell.



Having done with the upper part of my work, I
would now with all humble willingnesse set on[Pg 40]
the best peece of Soule-leather I have, did I not feare
I should break my All, which though it may be a
right old English blade, yet it is but little and weake.
I should esteeme it the best piece of workmanship my
Cobling hand every wrought, if it would please Him
whose worke it is, to direct me to speake such a word
over the sea, as the good old woman of Abel did over
the wall, in the like exigent: but alas, I am but simple.
What if I be?


When States dishelv'd are, and Lawes untwist,
Wise men keep their tongues, fools speak what they list.


I would not be so unwise as to grieve the wise, if
I were wise enough to foresee it: I would speake
nothing to the Cause or Continuance of these wearisome
Warres hitherto; the one is enough debated, the
other more than enough peracted. Nor would I declaime
of the uncomlinesse, unbrotherlinesse, unseasonablenesse
and unreasonablenesse of these direfull
digladiations: every stroak strucke sounds too loud
upon this harsh string. I would much rather speake
perswasives to a comely brotherly seasonable and
reasonable cessation of Armes on both sides, by a
drawn battaile: Wherein if I shall adventure a few
over-bold words, I intreat my ignorance, impartiality,
and Loyalty may plead pardon for me.

Foure meanes there are, and no more, within the
compasse of my consideration, conducing to what is
desired. Either to get the Standard fixed in heaven
by the Lord of Hosts taken downe, I meane by Re[Pg 41]formation:
Or to set up white colours instead of red,
on one side or other, I meane by Composition: Or
by furling up all the Ensignes on both sides, I meane
by mutuall and generall Cessation: Or by still displaying
all the Colours and Cornets of every batallion,
I mean by prosecution: without Reformation
there will hardly be any Composition; without Composition
little hope of Cessation; without Cessation
there must and will be Prosecution; which God forbid.


Reformation.

When the Roman Standard was defixed with
such difficulty at the battell between Hanniball
and Flaminius at Thrasimene, it proved an ill
Omen. When God gives quietnesse, who can make
trouble; when he hideth his face, who can behold him?
Whether it be against a nation or a man onely.
That the Hypocrite reigne not, lest the people be insnared,
Job 34. 29, 30. How can the sword of the
Lord put it selfe up into its scabbard and be quiet,
when himself hath given it a charge to the contrary?
Jer. 47. 6, 7. It was a Cardinall Truth which Cardinall
Poole spake to H. 8. Penes Reges est inferre bellum,
penes autem Deum terminare. If Kings will make
their beginnings, God will make his ends: much more
when himselfe begins: When I begin I will also
make an end, 1 Sam. 3. 12. Farre better were it, for
men to make an end with him in time, than put him
to make such an end with them as he there intends.

Politicall Reformation he seemes to call for now
indigitanter. When he beholds Christian Kingdomes[Pg 42]
and States unsound in their foundations, illineall in
their superstructures, unjust in their administrations;
he kicks them in peeces with the foot of his Indignation:
But when Religious Statesmen frame and build
by the levell and plummet of his wisdome, then people
may say as his servants of old, Looke upon Zion
the City of our Solemnities; Your eyes shall see it a
quiet habitation, a Tabernacle that shall not be taken
down; not one of the stakes thereof shall be removed,
neither shall any of the coards thereof bee broken;
Isa. 33. 20. neither by civill Commotions nor foraign
Invasions. When the coards of a State are exquisitely
tight, and the stakes firmely pitched; such a Tent
though but a Tent shall not easily flutter or fall:
But if the Tacklings be so loose, that the maine Mast
cannot stand steady, nor the Saile be well spread;
then may the lame take and divide a great prey, ver.
23. If Religion, Laws, Liberties, Affections, Conversations,
and foraigne Federacies be slight; the strength
of strong men shall be weaknesse, and the weaknesse
of the weak victorious.

Pura politeja ne unum admittit sol       cismulum, neque
valet, pr       scriptio in politicis aut moralibus. It may
maintain a bright conjecture, against a rusty Truth: a
legible possession, against an obliterate Claime: an
inconvenience, against a convenience; where no cleare
remedy may be had: but never any thing that is formally
sinfull, or materially mischievous. When rotten
States are soundly mended from head to foot,
proportions duly admeasured, Justice justly dispenced;
then shall Rulers and Subjects have peace with God[Pg 43]
and themselves: but till then, the gayest Kingdomes
shall be but ruffling scuffling, removing and commoving
hovells. For England, however the upper Stories
are shroadly shattered; yet the foundations and
frame being good or mendable by the Architectors
now at worke, there is good hope, when peace is setled,
people shall dwell more wind-tight and water-tight
than formerly. I earnestly wish our Mr. Builders
to remember, that punctuality in Divinity and
Politie, is but regularity; that what is amisse in the
mould, will misfashion the prosult: and that if this
market be slipt, things may grow as deare as ever
they were. Most expert Gentlemen, bee intreated at
length to set our Head right on our shoulders, that we
may once look upwards and goe forwards like proper
Englishmen.



God will also have Ecclesiasticall Reformation now,
or nothing: And here he stands not upon Kings,
Parliaments or Assemblies, but upon his own Termes.
I feare hee will have all drosse and base metalls
throughly melted away by these combustions, before
Hee quenches them; all his Ordinances and vessells
cast into his owne fashion, in his own mould, to his
own amussim, before he restores peace. There was
not a stone left upon a stone of the old Temple, before
the new was erected. If this first worke bee
throughly and throughoutly dispatched as I hope it is,
the great Remora is removed. If the Parliament and
Assembly be pleased to be as curious and industrious
as I have seen a great Popish Bishop in execcrating[Pg 44]
a Protestant Parish Church one day, and consecrating
it the next; they may adjourn awhile with leave
enough.

Some ten or twelve years before these Wars there
came to my view these two Predictions.


1. When God shall purge this Land with soap and nitre,
Woe be to the Crowne, woe be to the Mitre.



The accent of the blow shall fall there.


He that pities not the Crowne, pities not his owne
soule. Hee that pities not those that wore the Mitre,
more than they pitied themselves, or the Churches
over which they insulted, or the State then corrupted
and now Corruined by their pride and negligence,
is to blame.


2. There is a set of Bishops comming next behind,
Will ride the devill off his legs, and break his wind.


Poore men! they might have kept his backe till this
time for ought I know, had they not put him beyond
his pace: but Schollers must gallop, though they
tumble for it. Yet I commend them for this, they
gave him such straynes as made him blow short ever
since. I doubt the Assembly troubles him; and I
doubt he troubles them. Well, the Bishops are gone:
If they have carried away with them all that was in
the pockets of their Holliday hose, fare them well;
let them come againe when I give them a new Conge
d' slier, or send a Pursuivant for them; which if I
doe, I shall never trust myselfe more, though they[Pg 45]
have often done it for me, who never deserved that
honour. Some of them I confesse were very honest
men, and would have been honester if they dared for
their fellows.

The sad worke now, is to institute better things in
their Roome, and to induct better men in their roome;
rather where, and how to finde those things, they having
cunningy laid them so farre out of the way; I
doubt some good men cannot see them, when they
look full upon them: it is like, the Bishops carryed
away their eyes with them, but I feare they left their
Spectacles behind them. I use no spectacles, yet my
eyes are not fine enough, nor my hand steady enough
to cut by such fine threads as are now spun. I am I
know not what; I cannot tell what to make of my
selfe, nor I think no body else: My Trade is to finde
more faults than others will mend; and I am very
diligent at it; yet it scarce findes me a living, though
the Country findes me more worke than I can turne
my hand to.

For Church work, I am neither Presbyterian, nor
plebsbyterian, but an Interpendent: My task is to sit
and study how shapeable the Independent way will
be to the body of England, then my head akes on
one side; and how suitable the Presbyterian way, as
we heare it propounded, will bee to the minde of Christ,
then my head akes on the other side: but when I consider
how the Parliament will commoderate a way
out of both, then my head leaves aking: I am not,
without some contrivalls in my patching braines; but
I had rather suppose them to powder, than expose[Pg 46]
them to preregular, much lesse to preter-regular Judgements:
I shall therefore rejoyce that the work is faln
into so good hands, heads, and hearts, who will weigh
Rules by Troyweight, and not by the old Haber-du-pois:
and rather then meddle where I have so little
skill, I will sit by and tell my feares to them that have
the patience to heare them, and leave the red-hot
question to them that dare handle it.

I fear many holy men have not so deeply humbled
themselves for their former mis-worshippings of God
as he will have them before he reveales his secrets to
them: as they accounted things indifferent, so they
account indifferent repentance will serve turne. Son
of man, if my people be ashamed of all that they have
done, then shew them the forme of the house, and the
fashion thereof, else not, Ezek. 43. 11. A sin in Gods
worship, that seemes small in the common beame of
the world, may be very great in the scales of his Sanctuary.
Where God is very jealous, his servants should
be very cautelous.

I feare, the furnace wherein our new formes are casting,
is over-heat, and casts smoake in the eyes of our
founders, that they cannot well see what they doe, or
ought to doe; Omne perit judicium cum res transit
in affectum. Truth and peace are the Castor and Pollux
of the Gospell: they that seek the one without
the other, are like to finde neither: Anger will hinder
domestick Prayers, much more Ecclesiastique Councels.
What is produced by tumult, is either deficient
or redundant. When the judgements of good men
concurre with a harmonious Diapason, the result is me[Pg 47]lodious
and commodious. Warring and jarring men
are no builders of houses for God, though otherwise
very good. Instruments may be well made and well
strung, but if they be not well fretted, the Musique
is marred. The great Turke hearing Musitians so
long a tuning, he thought it stood not with his state
to wait for what would follow. When Christ whips
Market-makers out of his Temple, he raises dust: but
when he enters in with Truth and Holinesse, he calls
for deep silence, Hab. 2. 20. There must not a toole
be heard when the Tabernacle is reared: Nor is that
amiable or serviceable to men that passeth through so
many ill animadversions of Auditors and Spectators.
If the Assembly can hardly agree what to determine,
people will not easily agree what to accept.

I fear, these differences and delayes have occasioned
men to make more new discoveries then otherwise
they would. If publique Assemblies of Divines cannot
agree upon a right way, private Conventicles of
illiterate men, will soon find a wrong. Bivious demurres
breed devious resolutions. Passengers to heaven
are in haste, and will walk one way or other. He
that doubts of his way, thinkes hee loses his day: and
when men are gone awhile, they will be loth to turn
back. If God hide his path, Satan is at hand to turn
Convoy: If any have a minde to ride poste, he will
helpe them with a fresh spavin'd Opinion at every
Stage.


Where clocks will stand, and Dials have no light,
There men must goe by guesse, be't wrong or right.
[Pg 48]

I feare, if the Assembly of all Divines, doe not consent,
and concenter the sooner, God will breath a spirit
of wisedome and meeknesse, into the Parliament of
no Divines, to whom the Imperative and Coactive
power supremely belongs, to consult such a contemperate
way, as shall best please him, and profit his
Churches, so that it shall be written upon the doore
of the Assembly; The Lord was not there.

I feare, the importunity of some impatient, and subtlety
of some malevolent mindes, will put both Parliament
and Assembly upon some preproperations,
that will not be safe in Ecclesiasticall Constitutions.
To procrastinate in matters clear, as I said even now,
may be dangerous; so, not to deliberate in dubious
cases, will be as perilous. We here, though I think
under favour, wee have some as able Steersmen as
England affords, have been driven to tack about
again to some other points of Christs Compasse, and
to make better observations before we hoyse up sayles.
It will be found great wisdome in disputable cases, not
to walk on by twylight, but very cautelously; rather
by probationers for a time, then peremptory positives:
Reelings and wheelings in Church acts, are both difficult
and disadvantageous. It is rather Christian
modesty than shame, in the dawning of Reformation,
to be very perpensive. Christs mind is, that Evangelicall
policies, should be framed by Angelicall measures;
not by a line of flaxe, but by a golden Reed,
Rev. 21. 15.

I feare, he that sayes, the Presbyterian and Independent
way, if rightly carryed, doe not meet in one,[Pg 49]
he doth not handle his Compasses so considerately as
he should.

I feare, if Authority doth not establish a sutable
and peaceable Government of Churches the sooner,
the bells in all the steeples will ring awke so long,
that they will hardly be brought into tune any more.

My last, but not least feare, is, That God will hardly
replant his Gospel in any part of Christendome, in
so faire an Edition as is expected, till the whole field
hath been so ploughed and harrowed, that the soile
be throughly cleansed and fitted for new seed: Or
whether he will not transplant it into some other Regions,
I know not: This feare I have feared these 20
years, but upon what grounds I had rather bury than
broach.

I dare not but adde to what preceded about Church-Reformation,
a most humble petition, that the Authority
of the Ministry be kept in its due altitude:
if it be dropp'd in the dust, it will soon bee stifled:
Encroachments on both sides, have bred detriments
enough to the whole. The Separatists are content
their teaching Elders should sit highest on the Bench,
so they may sit in the Chaire over-against them; and
that their ruling Elders shall ride on the saddle, so
they may hold the bridle. That they may likewise
have seasonable and honorable maintenance, and that
certainly stated: which generally we find and practise
here as the best way. When Elders live upon
peoples good wills, people care little for their ill
wills, be they never so just: Voluntary contributions
or non-tributions of Members, put Ministers upon[Pg 50]
many temptations in administrations of their Offices:
two houres care does more dis-spirit an ingenuous
man than two dayes study: nor can an Elder be given
to hospitality, when he knowes not what will be
given him to defray it: it is pity men of gifts should
live upon men's gifts. I have seen most of the Reformed
Churches in Europ, and seene more misery
in these two respects, then it is meet others should
hear: the complaints of painfull Pareus, David Pareus,
to my selfe, with tears, concerning the Germane
Churches, are not to be related.

There is yet a personall Reformation, as requisite as
the Politicall. When States are so reformed, that
they conforme such as are profligate, into good civility:
civill men, into religious morality: When Churches
are so constituted, that Faith is ordained Pastor,
Truth Teacher, Holinesse and Righteousnesse ruling
Elders: Wisedome and Charity Deacons: Knowledge,
love, hope, zeale, heavenly-mindednesse, meeknesse,
patience, watchfulnesse, humility, diligence,
sobriety, modesty, chastity, constancy, prudence, contentation,
innocency, sincerity,      c. admitted members
and all their opposites excluded: then there will
bee peace of Country and Conscience.

Did the servants of Christ know what it is to live
in Reformed Churches with unreformed spirits, under
strict order with loose hearts, how formes of Religion
breed but formes of Godlinesse, how men by Church-discipline,
learne their Church-postures, and there
rest; they would pray as hard for purity of heart,
as purity of Ordinances. If we mocke God in these,[Pg 51]
He will mocke us; either with defeat of our hopes;
or which is worse: when we have what we so much
desire, we shall be so much the worse for it. It was
a well salted speech, uttered by an English Christian
of a Reformed Church in the Netherlands, Wee have
the good Orders here, but you have the good Christians
in England. Hee that prizes not Old England
Graces, as much as New England Ordinances,
had need goe to some other market before hee comes
hither. In a word, hee that is not Pastor, Teacher,
Ruler, Deacon and Brother to himselfe, and lookes
not at Christ above all, it matters not a farthing whether
he be Presbyterian or Independent: he may be a
zealot in bearing witnesse to which he likes best, and
yet an Iscariot to both, in the witnesse of his owne
Conscience.

I have upon strict observation, seen so much power
of godlinesse, and spirituall mindednesse in English
Christians, living meerly upon Sermons and private
duties, hardly come by, when the Gospell was little
more than symptomaticall to the State; such Epidemicall
and lethall formality in other disciplinated
Churches, that I professe in the hearing of God, my
heart hath mourned, and mine eyes wept in secret, to
consider what will become of multitudes of my deare
Country-men, when they shall enjoy what they now
covet: Not that good Ordinances breed ill Consciences,
but ill Consciences grow stark nought under
good Ordinances; insomuch that might I wish an
hypocrite the most perilous place but Hell, I should
wish him a Membership in a strict Reformed Church:[Pg 52]
and might I wish a sincere Servant of God, the greatest
griefe earth can afford, I should wish him to live
with a pure heart, in a Church impurely Reformed;
yet through the improvement of Gods Spirit, that
griefe may sanctifie him for Gods service and presence,
as much as the meanes he would have, but
cannot.

I speak this the rather to prevent, what in me lyes,
the imprudent romaging that is like to be in England,
from Villages to Townes, from Townes to Cities, for
Churches sake, to the undoing of Societies, Friendships,
Kindreds, Families, Heritages, Callings, yea,
the wise Providence of God in disposing mens habitations,
now in the very Infancy of Reformation: by
forgetting that a little leaven may season a large lump:
and it is much better to doe good than receive. It
were a most uncharitable and unserviceable part, for
good men to desert their own Congregations, where
many may glorifie God in the day of his Visitation,
for their presence and assistance. If a Christian would
picke out a way to thrive in grace, let him study to
administer grace to them that want: or to make sure
a blessing upon his Family; let him labour to multiply
the family of Christ, and beleeve, that he which
soweth liberally, shall reap abundantly; and hee that
spareth more than is need, from them that have more
need, shall surely come to poverty: yea, let me say,
that he who forsakes the meanes of grace for Christ
and his Churches sake, shall meet with a better bargaine,
namely, grace it selfe. It is a time now, when
full flocks should rather scatter to leane Churches,[Pg 53]
than gather from other places, to make themselves
fat; when able Christians should rather turne Jesuites
and Seminaries, than run into Covents and Frieries:
had this beene the course in the Primitive time, the
Gospel had been pinfolded up in a few Cities, and not
spread as it is.

What more ungodly sacriledge or manstealing can
there be, then to purloin from godly Ministers the first
born of their fervent prayers and faithfull preachings,
the leven of their flocks, the incouragement of their
soules, the Crowne of their labours, their Epistle to
Heaven? I am glad to heare our New-England Elders
generally detest it despuenter, and looke at it as a
killing Cordolium: If men will needs gather Churches
out of the world (as they say) let them first plough
the world, sow it, and reap it with their own hands,
and the Lord give them a liberall Harvest. He is a
very hard man that will reap where he hath not sowed,
and gather where he hath not strowed, Mat. 25.
24.

He that saith, it is or was our case, doth not rightly
understand himself or us, and he that takes his warrant
out of Joh. 4. 37. 38. is little acquainted with
Expositors. Wise men are amazed to hear that conscientious
Ministers dare spoile many Congregations
to make one for themselves.

In matter of Reformation, this would be remembred,
that in premonitory judgements, God will take
good words, and sincere intents; but in peremptory,
nothing but reall performances.[Pg 54]


Composition.

If Reformation were come thus neer, I should
hope Composition were not farre off: When
hearts meet in God, they will soon meet in Gods
wayes, and upon Gods termes. But to avoid prolixity,
which steales upon me; For Composition, I shall compose
halfe a dozen distichs concerning these kind of
Wars; wishing I could sing asleep these odious stirres
at least on some part, with a dull Ode. He is no Cobler
that cannot sing, nor no good Cobler that can sing well:


Si natura negat, facit indignatio versum   
Qualemcunque potest                Juvenal
}
They are these.



1.
They seldome lose the field, but often win,
That end their wars, before their wars begin.



2.
Their Cause is oft the worst, that first begin,
And they may lose the field, the field that win:[3]



3.
In Civill warrs, 'twixt Subjects and their King,
There is no conquest got, by conquering.



4.
Warre ill begun, the onely way to mend,
Is t' end the warre before the warre doe end.



5.
They that will end ill warrs, must have the skill,
To make an end by Rule, and not by Will.



6.
In ending warrs 'tween Subjects and their Kings,
Great things are sav'd, by losing little things.


[3] Victrix causa Diis placuit, sed victa Catoni. Lucan.[Pg 55]

Wee heare that Majestas Imperii hath challenged
Salus Populi into the field; the one fighting for Prerogatives,
the other defending Liberties: Were I a
Constable bigge enough, I would set one of them by
the heeles to keep both their hands quiet; I meane
onely in a paire of stocks, made of sound reason,
handsomely fitted for the legges of their Understanding.

If Salus Populi began, surely it was not that Salus
Populi which I left in England: That Salus
Populi was as mannerly a Salus Populi as need bee:
if I bee not much deceived, that Salus Populi suffer'd
its nose to be held to the Grindstone, till it was almost
ground to the grisles; and yet grew never the sharper
for ought I could discerne; What was, before
the world was made, I leave to better Antiquaries then
myselfe; but I thinke, since the world began, it was
never storied that Salus Populi began with Majestas
Imperii, unlesse Majestas Imperii first unharbour'd it,
and hunted it to a stand, and then it must either turne
head and live, or turn taile and die: but more have
been storyed on the other hand than Majestas Imperii
is willing to heare: I doubt not but Majestas Imperii
knows, that Common-wealths cost as much the
making as Crownes; and if they bee well made, would
yet outsell an ill-fashioned Crown, in any Market
overt, even in Smithfield, if they could be well
vouched.

But Preces       Lachrym       , are the people's weapons:
so are Swords and Pistols, when God and Parliaments
bid them Arme. Prayers and Teares are[Pg 56]
good weapons for them that have nothing but knees
and eyes; but most men are made with teeth and
nailes; onely they must neither scratch for Liberties,
nor bite Prerogatives, till they have wept and
prayed as God would have them. If Subjects must
fight for their Kings against other Kingdomes, when
their Kings will; I know no reason, but they may
fight against their Kings for their own Kingdomes,
when Parliaments say they may and must: but Parliaments
must not say they must, till God sayes they
may.

I can never beleeve that Majestas Imperii, was ever
so simple as to think, that if it extends it self beyond
its due Artique at one end, but Salus Populi must
Antartique it as farre at the other end, or else the
world will be Excentrick, and then it will whirle;
and if it once fall a whirling, ten to one, it will whirle
them off first, that sit in highest chaires on cushions
fill'd with Peacocks feathers; and they are like to
stand their ground fastest, that owne not one foot of
ground to stand upon. When Kings rise higher than
they should, they exhale Subjects higher than they
would: if the Primum Mobile should ascend one foot
higher than it is, it would hurry all the nether wheeles,
and the whole world on fire in 24 houres. No Prince
exceeds in Soveraignty, but his Subjects will exceed
as farre in some vitious Liberty, to abate their griefe;
or some pernicious mutiny, to abate their Prince.


The crazy world will crack, in all the middle joynts.
If all the ends it hath, have not their parapoynts.
[Pg 57]

Nor can I beleeve that Crownes trouble Kings
Heads, so much as Kings heads trouble Crownes: nor
that they are flowers of Crowns that trouble Crowns,
but rather some Nettles or Thistles mistaken for
flowers.

To speake plainer English, I have wondred these
thirty yeares what Kings aile: I have seen in my time,
the best part of twenty Christian Kings and Princes;
Yet as Christian as they were, some or other were still
scuffling for Prerogatives. It must be granted at all
hands, that Pr       rogativ        Regis are necessary Supporters
of State: and stately things to stately Kings:
but if withall, they be Derogativ        Regno, they are
but little things to wise Kings. Equity is as due
to People, as Eminency to Princes: Liberty to Subjects,
as Royalty to Kings: If they cannot walk together
lovingly hand in hand, pari passu, they must
cut girdles and part as good friends as they may: Nor
must it be taken offensively, that when Kings are
haling up their top-gallants, Subjects lay hold on their
slablines; the head and body must move alike: it is
nothing meet for me to say with Horace,


Ut tu fortunam, sic nos te Car'le feremus.


But I hope I may safely say,


The body beares the head, the head the Crown;
If both beare not alike, then one will down.


Distracting Nature, calls for distracting Remedies;
perturbing policies for disturbing cures: If one Ex[Pg 58]treame
should not constitute its Anti-Extreame, all
things would soon be in extremo: if ambitious windes
get into Rulers Crownes, rebellious vapours will into
Subjects Caps, bee they stopt never so close: Yet the
tongues of Times tell us of ten Preter-royall Usurpations,
to one contra-civill Rebellion.

Civill Liberties and Proprieties admeasured, to every
man to his true suum, are the prima pura principia,
propria quarto modo, the sine quibus of humane
States, without which, men are but women. Peoples
prostrations of these things when they may lawfully
helpe it, are prophane prostitutions; ignorant Ideottismes,
under naturall noddaries; and just it is that
such as undersell them, should not re-inherit them in
haste, though they seeke it carefully with teares. And
such usurpations by Rulers, are the unnaturalizings of
nature, disfranchisements of Freedome, the Neronian
nullifyings of Kingdomes: yea, I beleeve the Devill
himselfe would turne Round-head, rather then suffer
these Columnes of Common-wealths to be slighted:
as he is a creature, he feares decreation; as an Angell,
dehominations; as a Prince, dis-common-wealthings;
as finite, these pen-infinite insolencies, which are the
most finite Infinites of misery to men on this side the
worlds dissolution: therefore it is, that with Gods
leave, he hath sounded an alarm to all the susque deques,
pell-mels, one and alls, now harrassing sundry
parts of Christendome. It is enough for God to be Infinite,
too much for man to bee Indefinite. He that
will flye too high a quarry for Absolutenesse, shall
stoope as much too low before he remounts his proper[Pg 59]
pitch: If Jacob will over top his brother out of Gods
time and way, he will so hamstring him, that hee shall
make legs whether he will or no, at his brothers approach:
and such as over-run all humane measure,
shall seldome returne to humane mercy: There are
sins besides the sin against the Holy Ghost, which
shall not be expiated by sacrifice for temporall revenge:
I mean when they are boyled up to a full consistence
of contumacy and impenitency. Let absolute Demands
or Commands be put into one scale, and indefinite
refusalls into the other: all the Goldsmiths in Cheapeside,
cannot tell which weighs heaviest. Intolerable
griefes to Subjects, breed the Iliaca passio in a body
politick, which inforces that upwards which should
not. I speak these things to excuse, what I may, my
Countrymen in the hearts of all that look upon their
proceedings.

There is a quadrobulary saying which passes current
in the Westerne World, That the Emperour is
King of Kings, the Spaniard, King of Men, the
French, King of Asses, the King of England, King
of Devills. By his leave that first brayed the speech,
they are pretty wise Devills and pretty honest; the
worse they doe, is to keep their Kings from devillizing,
and themselves from Assing: Were I a King (a simple
supposall) I would not part with one good English
Devill, for some two of the Emperours Kings, nor three
of the Spaniards Men, nor foure French Asses; If I
did I should thinke my selfe an Asse for my labour.
I know nothing that Englishmen want, but true
Grace, and honest pride; let them be well furnisht[Pg 60]
with those two, I feare they would make more Asses,
then Spaine can make men, or the Emperour Kings.
You will say I am now beyond my latchet; but you
would not say so, if you knew how high my latchet
will stretch; when I heare a lye with a latchet, that
reaches up to his throat that first forged it.

He is a good King that undoes not his Subjects by
any one of his unlimited Prerogatives: and they are
a good People, that undoe not their Prince, by any
one of their unbounded Liberties, be they the very
least. I am sure either may, and I am sure neither
would be trusted, how good soever. Stories tell us
in effect, though not in termes, that over-risen Kings,
have been the next evills to the world, unto fallen Angels;
and that over-franchised people, are devills
with smooth snaffles in their mouthes. A King that
lives by Law, lives by love; and he that lives above
Law, shall live under hatred doe what he can. Slavery
and knavery goe as seldome asunder, as Tyranny
and Cruelty.

I have a long while thought it very possible, in a
time of Peace, and in some Kings Reigne, for disert
Statesmen, to cut an exquisite thred between Kings
Prerogatives, and Subjects Liberties of all sorts, so as
C       sar might have his due, and People their share,
without such sharpe disputes. Good Casuists would
case it, and case it, part it, and part it; now it, and
then it, punctually. Aquinas, Suarez, or Valentia,
would have done it long ere this, had they not beene
Popish, I might have said knavish; for, if they be so
any where, it is in their Tractates of Priviledges.[Pg 61]
Our Common Law doth well, but it must doe better before
things doe as they should. There are some Maximes
in Law, that would be taught to speake a little
more mannerly, or else well Anti-Maxim'd: we say,
the King can doe a Subject no wrong; why may wee
not say, the Parliament can doe the King no wrong?
We say, Nullum tempus occurrit Regi in taking
wrong; why may wee not say, Nullum tempus succurrit
Regi in doing wrong? which I doubt will
prove as good a Canon if well examined.

Authority must have power to make and keep people
honest; People, honesty to obey Authority; both,
a joynt-Councell to keep both safe. Morall Lawes,
Royall Prerogatives, Popular Liberties, are not of
Mans making or giving, but Gods: Man is but to
measure them out by Gods Rule: which if mans wisdome
cannot reach, Mans experience must mend:
And these Essentialls, must not be Ephorized or Tribuned
by one or a few Mens discretion, but lineally
sanctioned by Supreame Councels. In pro-re-nascent
occurrences, which cannot be foreseen; Diets, Parliaments,
Senates, or accountable Commissions, must
have power to consult and execute against intersilient
dangers and flagitious crimes prohibited by the light
of Nature: Yet it were good if States would let People
know so much beforehand, by some safe woven
manifesto, that grosse Delinquents may tell no tales of
Anchors and Buoyes, nor palliate their presumptions
with pretence of ignorance. I know no difference in
these Essentialls, between Monarchies, Aristocracies,
or Democracies; the rule will be found par-rationall,[Pg 62]
say Schoolmen and Pretorians what they will. And
in all, the best Standard to measure Prerogatives, is
the Ploughstaffe; to measure Liberties, the Scepter:
if the tearms were a little altered into Loyall Prerogatives
and Royall Liberties, then we should be sure
to have Royall Kings and Loyall Subjects.


Subjects their King, the King his Subjects greets,
Whilome the Scepter and the Plough-staffe meets.


But Progenitors have had them for four and twenty
predecessions: that would be spoken in the Norman
tongue or Cimbrian, not in the English or Scottish:
When a Conquerour turnes Christian, Christianity
turns Conquerour: if they had had them time out
of minde of man, before Adam was made, it is not a
pin to the point in foro rect        rationis: Justice and
Equity were before time, and will be after it: Time
hath neither Politicks nor Ethicks, good nor evill in
it; it is an empty thing, as empty as a New-English
purse, and emptier it cannot bee: a man may break
his neck in time, and in a lesse time then he can
heale it.

But here is the deadly pang, it must now be taken
by force and dint of sword: I confesse it is a deadly
pang to a Spirit made all of flesh, but not to a mortified
heart: it is good to let God have his will as hee
please, when we have not reason to let him have it
as we should; remembring, that hitherto he hath
taken order, that ill Prerogatives gotten by the Sword,
should in time be fetcht home by the Dagger, if nothing
else will doe it: Yet I trust there is both day and[Pg 63]
means to intervent this bargaine. But if they should;
if God will make both King and Kingdome the better
by it, what should either lose? I am sure there
is no great cause for either to make great brags.


Pax quo carior, eo charior.



A peace well made, is likeliest then to hold,
When 'tis both dearly bought and dearly sold.


I confesse, he that parts with such pearles to be
paid in old iron, had need to be pityed more by his
faithfull friends, than he is like to be by his false
flatterers. My heart is surcharged, I can no longer
forbear.



My Dearest Lord, and my more than dearest
King, I most humbly beseech you upon mine
aged knees, that you would please to arme your minde
with patience of proofe, and to intrench your selfe as
deep as you can, in your wonted Royall meeknesse;
for I am resolved to display my unfurled soule in your
very face, and to storme you with volyes of Love and
Loyalty. You owe the meanest true Subject you
have, a close account of these open Warres: they are
no Arcana imperii. Then give mee leave to inquire
of your Majesty, what you make in fields of blood,
when you should be amidst your Parliament of peace:
What you doe sculking in the suburbs of Hell, when
your Royall Pallaces stand desolate, through your
absence? What moves you to take up Armes against
your faithfull Subjects, when your Armes should bee[Pg 64]
embracing your mournfull Queen? What incenses
your heart to make so many widdowes and Orphans,
and among the rest your owne? Doth it become you,
the King of the stateliest Island the world hath, to
forsake your Throne, and take up the Manufacture of
cutting your Subjects throats, for no other sin, but
for Deifying you so over-much, that you cannot be
quiet in your Spirit, till they have pluckt you downe
as over-low? Doe your three Kingdomes so trouble
you, that they must all three be set on fire at once, that
when you have done, you may probably runne away
by their light into utter darknesse? Doe your three
Crownes sit so heavy on your head, that you will
break the backs of the three bodies that set them on,
and helpt you beare them so honourably? Have your
three Lamb-like flocks so molested you, that you must
deliver them up to the ravening teeth of evening
Wolves? Are you so angry with those that never
gave you just cause to be angry, but by their too much
feare to anger you at all, when you gave them cause
enough? Are you so weary of Peace, that you will
never be weary of Warre? Are you so willing to
warre at home, who were so unwilling to warre abroad,
where and when you should? Are you so
weary of being a good King, that you will leave your
selfe never a good Subject? Have you peace of Conscience,
in inforcing many of your Subjects to fight
for you against their Conscience? Are you provided
with Answers at the great Tribunall, for the destruction
of so many thousands, whereof every man was
as good a man as your Self, qua man?[Pg 65]

Is it not a most unworthy part for you to bee running
away from your Subjects in a day of battel, upon
whose Pikes you may come safe with your naked
breast and welcome? Is it honourable for you to be
flying on horses, from those that would esteeme it
their greatest honour, to beare you on their humble
shoulders to your Chaire of Estate, and set you down
upon a Cushion stuffed with their hearts? Is it your
prudence to be inraged with your best friends, for
adventuring their lives to rescue you from your worst
enemies? Were I a King, pardon the supposall, I
would hang that Subject by the head, that would not
take me by the heels, and dragge me to my Court,
when he sees me shifting for life in the ruined Countrey,
if nothing else would doe it; And I would
honour their very heels, that would take me by the
very head, and teach me, by all just meanes, to King
it better, when they saw me un-Kinging my selfe and
Kingdome: Doe you not know Sir, that, as when
your people are sicke of the Kings-evill, God hath
given you a gift to heale them? so when your selfe
are sicke of it, God hath given the Parliament a gift
to heale you: Hath your Subjects love been so great
to you, that you will spend it all, and leave your children
little or none? Are you so exasperated against
wise Scotland, that you will make England your foole
or foot-stoole? Is your fathers Sonne growne more
Orthodox, then his most Orthodox father, when he
told his Sonne, that a King was for a kingdome, and
not a kingdome for a King? parallell to that of the
Apostle; the husband is but by the wife, but the wife
of the husband.[Pg 66]

Is Majestas Imperii growne so kickish, that it cannot
stand quiet with Salus Populi, unlesse it be fettered?
Are you well advised, in trampling your Subjects
so under your feet, that they can finde no place
to be safe in, but over your head: Are you so inexorably
offended with your Parliament, for suffering
you to returne as you did, when you came into their
house as you did, that you will be avenged on all
whom they represent? Will you follow your very
worst Councell so far, as to provoke your very best,
to take better counsell than ever they did? If your
Majesty be not Popish, as you professe, and I am
very willing to beleeve, why doe you put the Parliament
to resume the Sacrament of the Altar, or Consubstantions
in saying, the King and Parliament,
the King and Parliament? breaking your simple
Subjects braines to understand such mysticall Parleenment?
I question much, whether they were not better
speake plainer English, then such Latine as the
Angels can hardly construe, and God happily loves
not to perse; I can as well admit an ubiquitary King
as another, if a King be abroad in any good affaire;
but if a King be at home and will circumscribe himselfe
at Oxford, and proscribe or discribe his Parliament
at Westminster, if that Parliament will prescribe
what they ought, without such paradoxing, I
should think God would subscribe a Le Dieu le
veult readily enough.

Is your Advisera such a Suavamen to you, that
hath been such a Gravamen to Religion and Peace?
Shall the chiefe bearing wombe of your Kingdome,[Pg 67]
be ever so constituted, that it cannot be delivered of
its owne deliverance, in what pangs soever it be, without
the will of one man-midwife, and such a man as
will come and not come, but as he list: nor bring a
Parliament to bed of a well-begotten Liberty without
an entire Subsidy? Doe not your Majesty being a
Schollar, know, that it was a truth long before it was
spoken, that Mundus est unus aut nullus, that there
is Principum purum unum, which unites the world
and all that is in it; where that is broken, things fall
asunder, that whatsoever is duable or triable, is fryable.

Is the Militia of your Kingdome, such an orient
flower of your Crowne, which all good Herbalists
judge but a meere nettle, while it is in any one mans
hand living? May not you as well challenge the absolute
disposall of all the wealth of the Kingdome
as of all the strength of your Kingdome? Can you
put any difference? unlesse it bee this, that mens
hearts and bones are within their skins, more proper
and intrinsecall, their lands and cattell more externall:
dare you not concredit the Militia, with those to
whom you may betrust your heart, better then your
owne breast? Will they ever harme you with the
Militia, that have no manner of malitia against you,
but for mis-imploying the Militia against them by
the malitia of your ill Counsellours? What good
will the Militia doe you when you have wasted the
Realme of all the best Milites it hath? May not your
Majesty see through a paire of Spectacles, glazed
with inch-board; that while you have your Advisera
in one hand, and the Militia in the other, you have[Pg 68]
the neckes of your Subjects under your feet, but not
your heart in your owne hand? doe you not know
that malum est, posse malum?

Hath Episcopacy beene such a religious Jewell in
your State, that you will sell all or most of your Coronets,
Caps of honour, and blue Garters, for six and
twenty cloth Caps? and your Barons Cloakes, for so
many Rockets, whereof usually twenty have had
scarce good manners enough to keepe the other six
sweet? Is no Bishop no King, such an oraculous
Truth, that you will pawne your Crowne and life upon
it? if you will, God may make it true indeed on
your part: Had you rather part with all, then lose a
few superfluous tumours, to pare off your monstrousnesse?
Will you be so covetous, as to get more then
you ought, by losing more then you need? Have you
not driven good Subjects enough abroad, but you will
also slaughter them that stay at home? Will you take
such an ill course, that no prayers can fasten that good
upon you we desier? Is there not some worse root
than all these growing in your Spirit, bringing forth
all this bitter fruit? against which you should take up
Arms, rather then against your harmlesse Subjects?
Doe you not foresee, into what importable head-tearings
and heart-searchings you will be ingulfed, when
the Parliament shall give you a mate, though but a
Stale? Methinkes it should breake your heart, to see
such a one as I, presume so much upon your clemency
and too much upon your Majesty, which your
Selfe have so eclipsed by the interposall of your Selfe
between your Selfe and your Selfe, that it hath not[Pg 69]
ray's enough left to dazle downe the height of my
affections to the awe of my Judgement.

Tres-Royall Sir, I once againe beseech you, with
teares dropping from my hoary head, to cover your
Selfe as close as you may, with the best shield of
goodnesse you have: I have somewhat more to say,
which may happily trouble not your Selfe, but your
followers, more than what is already said. There lived
in your Realme and Reigne two whom I may well
tearme Prophets, both now in a better Kingdome;
whereof one foretold two things concerning your Majesty,
of these very proceedings, long before they began;
which being done and past shall bee buried in
silence: the other made this prediction about the
same time.


King Charles will joyne Himselfe to bitter Griefe,
Then joyne to God, and prove a Godly Chiefe.


His words were in prose these, King Charles will
come into fetters, meaning strong afflictions, and then
prove as good a King, as such a good King of Israel,
whom he then named, but I need not: he was as inwardly
acquainted with the minde of God, as fervent
and frequent a Beadsman for your welfare, and had
as religious Opticks of State, as any man I know:
foure other Predictions he made, full as improbable as
this, whereof three are punctually performed. A good
Christian being sometime in conflicts of Conscience,
hurried with long tentations, used this speech to my
selfe, I am now resolved to be quiet, for I plainly see,
God will save me whether I will or no: If your Ma[Pg 70]jesty
would be pleased to thinke so in your heart, and
say so with your mouth, all the good Subjects you
have, would say, Amen, till the heavens rang, and I
hope you have few so bad, but would say, So be it.

Much lamented Sir, If you will please to retire your
Selfe to your Closet, whither you may most safely
come, and make your peace with God, for the vast
heritage of sinne your Intombed father left upon your
score, the dreadful Imprecation he poured upon the
heads of his tender posterity in Summersets and Overburyes
Case, published in Starchamber by his Royall
command; your owne sinful marriage, the sophistocation
of Religion and Policie in your time, the luxury
your Court and Country, your connivance with the
Irish butcheries, your forgetfull breaches upon the
Parliament, your compliance with Popish Doegs, with
what else your Conscience shall suggest: and give
us, your guilty Subjects example to doe the like,
who have held pace and proportion with you in our
evill wayes: we will helpe you by Gods assistance,
to poure out rivers of tears, to wash away the streams
of blood, which have beene shed for these heavy accounts;
we will also helpe you, God helping us, to
beleeve, that there is hope in Israel for these things;
and Balme enough in his Gilead to heale all the broken
bones of your three kingdomes, and to redouble
your honour and our peace: His Arme is infinite;
to an infinite power all things are equally faisable, to
an infinite mercy, all sinnes equally pardonable. The
Lord worke these things in us and for us, for his compassions
sake in Jesus Christ.

Sir, you may now please to discover your Selfe[Pg 71]
where you think meet; I trust I have not indangered
you: I presume your Ear-guard will keep farre enough
from you, what ever I have said: be it so, I have discharged
my duty, let them look to theirs. If my
tongue should reach your eares, which I little hope
for; Let it be once said; the great King of great Britaine,
tooke advise of a simple Cobler, yet such a Cobler,
as will not exchange either his blood or his pride,
with any Shoo-maker or Tanner in your Realme, nor
with any of your late Bishops which have flattered
you thus in peeces: I would not speake thus in the
eares of the world, through the month of the Presse
for all the plunder your plunderers have pillaged;
were it not somewhat to abate your Royall indignation
toward a loyall Subject; a Subject whose heart
hath been long carbonadoed, des veniam verbo, in
flames of affection towards you. Your Majesty knowes
or may know, time was, when I did, or would have
done you a better peece of service, than all your
Troopes and Regiments are now doing. Should I
heare any Gentleman that follows you, of my yeares,
say hee loves you better than I, if it were lawfull, I
would sweare by my Sword, he said more than his
sword would make good.

Gracious Sir, Vouchsafe to pardon me my no other
sins, but my long Idolatry towards you, and my loving
you too hard in this speech, and I will pardon you
your Treason against me, even me, by committing
Treason against your Selfe my Lord and King;[4] and[Pg 72]
your murther, in murthering me, even me, by murthering
my deare fellow Subjects, bone of my bone,
and flesh of my flesh, and of yours also. If you will
not pardon me, I will pardon my selfe, dwell in my
own clothes as long as I can, and happily make as
good a shift for my proportion, as he that hath a
lighter paire of heeles: And when you have done
what you please and what you can, I am resolved
to be


As loyall a Subject to your Majesty when I
have never a head on my shoulders, as
you a Royall King to me, when you have
your three Crownes on your head,



Theod: de la Guard.


[4] I speake in termes of Divinity not of Law and am deepely grieved
that I am forced to such necessary over boldnesse.


Sir,


I Cannot give you over thus; I most earnestly implore
you, that you would not deferre to consider
yourselfe throughly, you are now returned to the
brinke of your Honour and our Peace, stand not too
long there, your State is full of distractions, your people
of expectations, the importune Affaires of your
Kingdome perplexedly suspended, your good Subjects
are now rising into a resolution to pray you on to your
throne, or into your Tombe, into Grace with your Parliament
and People, or into Glory with the Saints in
Heaven; but how you will get into the one, without
passing first through th' other, is the riddle they cannot
untye. If they shall ply the Throne of Grace
hard, God will certainely heare, and in a short time[Pg 73]
mould you to his minde, and convince you, that it
had and will bee farre easier to sit downe meekely
upon the Rectum, than to wander resolutely in obliquities,
which with Kings, seldome faile to dissembogue
into bottomlesse Seas of sorrows.

Dearest Sir, be intreated to doe what you doe sincerely;
the King of Heaven and Earth can search
and discover the hiddenest corner of your heart, your
Parliament understands you farre better then you may
conceive, they have many eares and eyes, and good
ones, I beleeve they are Religiously determined to
re-cement you to your Body so exquisitely, that the
Errors of State and Church, routed by these late stirs,
may not re-allee hereafter, nor Themselves be made
a curse to the issue of their own bodies, nor a Scoffe,
to all Politique Bodies in Europe. The Lord give
your Majesty and all your Royall Branches the spirit
of wisedome and understanding, the Spirit of knowledge
and his feare, for His mercy and Christ his sake.



I Would my skill would serve me also, as well as
my heart, to translate Prince Rupert, for his
Queen-mothers sake, Eliz. a second. Mismeane me
not. I have had him in my armes when he was
younger, I wish I had him there now: if I mistake
not, he promised then to be a good Prince, but I doubt
he hath forgot it: if I thought he would not be angry
with me, I would pray hard to his Maker, to make
him a right Roundhead, a wise hearted Palatine, a
thankfull man to the English; to forgive all his sinnes,
and at length to save his soule, notwithstanding all[Pg 74]
his God-damne mee's: yet I may doe him wrong; I
am not certaine hee useth that oath; I wish no man
else would. I dare say the Devills dare not. I thank
God I have lived in a Colony of many thousand English
almost these twelve yeares, am held a very sociable
man; yet I may considerately say, I never heard
but one Oath sworne, nor never saw one man drunk,
nor ever heard of three women Adulteresses, in all
this time, that I can call to minde: If these sinnes
bee amongst us privily, the Lord heale us. I would
not bee understood to boast of our innocency; there
is no cause I should, our hearts may be bad enough,
and our lives much better. But to follow my businesse.

Prosecutions of Warres betweene a King and his
Parliament, are the direfull dilacerations of the world,
the cruell Catastrophes of States, dreadfull to speake
of; they are nefanda       n' agenda: I know no
grounds can be given of them but two: Either upon
Reason founded upon some surmisall of Treason,
which my reason cannot reach: I could never conceive
why a rationall King should commit Treason
against a reasonable Parliament; or how a faithfull
Parliament against their lawfull King: the most I can
imagine, is a misprision of Treason, upon a misprision
of Reason. Hee that knows not the Spirit of his
King, is an Atheist. Our King is not Charles le
simple sometime of France: he understands not our
King that understands him not to bee understanding.
The Parliament is supposed Omniscient, because under
God they are Omnipotent: if a Parliament have[Pg 75]
not as much knowledge and all other vertues, as all
the Kingdome beside, they are no good Abridgement
of the Common-wealth. I beleeve Remonstrances
have demonstrated enough concerning this point of
Reason, to give satisfaction to such as satisfaction will
satisfie.


Or upon Will.

The Will of a King is very numinous; it hath a
kinde of vast universality in it, it is many times greater
than the will of his whole kingdome, stiffened
with ill Counsell and ill Presidents: if it be not a foot
and half lesser than the Will of his Councell, and
three foot lesser than the Will of his Parliament, it is
too big. I think it were well for a King if hee had
no will at all, but were all Reason. What if he committed
his morall will to Divines, that were no Bishops?
his Politicall, to his Parliament, and a Councell
chosen by Parliament? that if ever it miscarry, they
may blame themselves most, and him least. I scarce
know any King that hath such advantage as ours;
his three kingdomes lye so distinct and entire, that if
he please, he might keep them like three gardens without
a weed, if he would let God keep his will, without
wilfulnesse and rashnesse.

I have observed men to have two kindes of Wills,
a Free-hold will, such as men hold in Capite of themselves;
or a Copy-hold will, held at the will of other
Lords or Ladies. I have read almost all the Common
Law of England, and some Statutes; yet I never
read, that the Parliament held their will in such[Pg 76]
a Capite: their Tenure is Knight-service, and good
Knight-service too, or else they are to blame. And
I am sure, a King cannot hold by Copy, at the will of
other Lords; the Law calls that base tenure, inconsistent
with Royalty; much more base is it, to hold
at the will of Ladies: Apron-string tenure is very
weak, tyed but of a slipping knot, which a childe may
undoe, much more a King. It stands not with our
Queens honour to weare an Apron, much lesse her
Husband, in the strings; that were to insnare both
him and her self in many unsafeties. I never heard
our King was Effeminate: to be a little Uxorious personally,
is a vertuous vice in Oeconomicks; but Royally,
a vitious vertue in Politicks. To speak English,
Books and tongues tell us, I wish they tell us true,
that the Error of these Wars on our Kings part proceeds
only from ill Counsellours.

Ill Counsellours are very ill Gamesters; if they see
their own stake a losing, they will play away King,
Queen, Bishops, Knights, Rooks, Pawnes, and all,
before they will turne up the board: they that play
for lusts, will play away themselves, and not leave
themselves so much as a heart to repent; and then
there is no Market left but Hell; if the case be thus,
it is to no end to look for any end, till one side make
an end of the other.


They that at stake their Crownes and Honours set,
Play lasting games, if Lust or Guilt doe bet.
[Pg 77]


Cessation.

If God would vouchsafe to give his Majesties Religion
and Reason, power to fling his Wills head
over the Wall, in matter of Composition, and his Subjects
strength to throw their lusts after it, Arms would
be soon laid down, and Peace soon taken up. They
that are not at peace with God, are not at peace with
themselves, whatever they think; and they that are
not at peace with themselves, cannot be at peace with
others, if occasion provokes, be their natures never so
good.

So farre as I can conjecture, the chiefe impediment
to a generall and mutuall Cessation of Armes, is, a
despaire of mutuall and generall forgivenesse. If ever
England had need of a generall Jubile in Heaven
and Earth, it is now. Our King and Parliament have
been at great strife, who should obtaine most Justice:
if they would now strive, who should shew most
Mercy, it would heare well throughout the world.
Here also my speech must be twofold and blind-fold.
It is now nine Moneths and more since the last credible
News was acted: it is possible by this, the Parliament
may be at the Kings mercy: Did I say a
Kings mercy? what can I say more? no man on
earth, can shew more mercy then a King, nor shall
need more, when he comes to give an Account of his
Kingdome: Nor did ever any Parliament merit more
mercy than this, for they never sinned, that I know,
I meane against the Common and Statute Law of
England: it is pity they who have given so many
general pardons, should want one now. If our King[Pg 78]
hath lost his way, and thereby learned to looke to
his path better hereafter, and taught many Successors
to King it right for many Ages; Me thinks it
should impetrate a Royall Redintegration, upon a Royall
acknowledgement and ingagement. But how
should an erring King trust a provoked Parliament?
Surely he may trust God safe enough; who will never
trust that State more with a good King, that will
doe ill to a King that is turned so good. Me thinks
those passages of Scripture, Esa. 43. 24, 25. chap.
57. 17, 18. The strange illation, Hos. 2. 13, 14.
should melt a heart of steele into floods of mercy.

For others, were my head, one of the heads which
first gave the King Counsell to take up these Armes,
or to persist in them, when at any time he would
have disbanded, I would give that head to the Kingdome,
whether they would or no; if they would not
cut it off, I would cut it off myselfe, and tender it at
the Parliament doore, upon condition that all other
heads might stand, which stand upon penitent hearts,
and will doe better on than off; then I would carry
it to London-Bridge, and charge my tongue to teach
all tongues, to pronounce Parliament right hereafter.

When a kingdom is broken just in the neck joynt,
in my poore policy, ropes and hatchets are not the
kindliest instruments to set it: Next to the spilling
of the blood of Christ for sin, the sparing of the blood
of sinners, where it may be as well spared as spilt, is
the best way of expiation. It is no rare thing for
Subjects to follow a leading King; if he will take his
truncheon in his hand, it is to be expected many will[Pg 79]
put their swords in their Belts. Sins that rise out of
mistake of judgement, are not so sinfull as those of
malice ordinarily: and when multitudes sin, multitudes
of mercy are the best Anodines.


       gratia gratis data, gratissima.



Grace will dissolve, but rigour hardens guilt:
Break not with Steely blowes, what oyle should melt.

In Breaches integrant, 'tween Principalls of States,
Due Justice may suppresse, but Love redintegrates.


Whosoever be pardoned, I pray not let Britanicus
scape, I mean a pardon. I take him to be a very
serviceable Gentleman; Out of my entire respect to
him, I shall presume to give him half a dozen stitches
of advice:

I intreat him to consider that our King is not onely
a man, but a King in affliction; Kings afflictions are
beyond Subjects apprehensions; a Crown may happily
ake as much as a whole Common-wealth.

I desire him also to conceale himself as deeply as
he can, if he cannot get a speciall pardon, to weare a
Latitat about his neck, or let him lie close under the
Philosophers stone, and I'le warrant him for ever
being found.

If he be discovered, I counsell him to get his head
set on faster than our New-England Taylors use to
set on Buttons; Kings, and Kings Childrens memories
are as keen as their Subjects wits.

If he fears any such thing, that he would come over
to us, to helpe recruite our bewildred brains: we will[Pg 80]
promise to maintain him so long as he lives, if he
will promise to live no longer then we maintain him.

If he should bee discovered and his head chance
to be cut off against his will, I earnestly beseech him
to bequeath his wits to me and mine in Fee-simple,
for we want them, and cannot live by our hands in
this Country.

Lastly, I intreat him to keep his purse, I give
him my counsell gratis, confessing him to be more
then my match, and that I am very loath to fall into
his hands.


Prosecution.

If Reformation, Composition, Cessation, can finde
no admittance, there must and will be Prosecution:
to which I would also speak briefly and indifferently
still to both sides; and first to that, which I had rather
call Royalists then Cavaliers; who if I mistake
not, fight against the Truth.

Foolish Cowardly man (I pray patience, for I speak
nothing but the pulse of my owne heart) dreads and
hates, nothing in Heaven or Earth, so much as
Truth: it is not God, nor Law, nor sinne, nor death,
nor hell, that he feares, but onely because he feares
there is Truth in them: Could he de-truth them all,
he would defie them all: Let Perdition it self come
upon him with deadly threats, fiery swords, displayed
vengeance, he cares not: Let Salvation come cap
in hand, with naked Reason, harmelesse Religion,
lawny embracements, he will rather flye or dye, than
entertaine it: come Truth in what shape it will, hee[Pg 81]
will reject it: and when hee can beat it off with
most steely prowesse, he thinkes himselfe the bravest
man; when in truth it is nothing but exsanguine feeble
exility of Spirit. Thy heart, saith the Prophet
Ezek. 16. 30. is weake, like the heart of an imperious
whorish woman: a man would thinke, the heart of
an imperious whore, were the very pummell of Scanderbergs
sword; alas, she is hen-hearted, shee dares
not looke Truth in the face; if she dared, shee would
neither be whorish, nor imperious, nor weake. He
shews more true fortitude, that prayes quarter of the
least Truth, at a miles distance, than hee that breakes
through and hewes downe the most Theban Phalanx
that ever field bore. Paul exprest more true valour,
in saying, I can doe nothing against the Truth, than
Goliah, in defying the whole hoste of Israel.

Couragious Gentlemen, Yee that will stab him
that gives you the lye; take heed yee spend not
your bloods, limbes and soules, in fighting for some
untruth: and yee that will fling out the gantlet to him
that calls you Coward, dishonour not your selves
with such Cowardise, as to fight against Truth, meerly
for feare of it. A thousand pities it is, such gallant
Spirits should spend their lives, honours, heritages,
and sweet relations in any Warres, where, for
ought many of them know, some false mistake commands
in Chiefe.

Honoured Country-men, bee intreated to love
Truth: if it loves not you againe, and repaires not all
your losses, then install some Untruth in its roome for
your Generall. If you will needs warre, be perswad[Pg 82]ed
to contend lawfully, wisely and stedfastly, against
all errours in Divinity and Policy: they are the cursed
Counter-mures, dropt Portcullises, scouring Angiports,
sulphurious Granado's, laden murtherers, peevish
Galthropes, and rascall desperadoes, which the Prince
of lyes imployes with all his skill and malice, to
maintaine the walls and gates of his kingdome, when
Truth would enter in with grace and peace to save
forlorne sinners, and distressed Commonwealthes:
witnesse the present deplorable estate of sundry States
in Europe.

Give me leave to speake a word more: it is but
this; Yee will finde it a farre easier field, to wage
warre against all the Armies that ever were or will be
on Earth, and all the Angels of Heaven, than to take
up Armes against any truth of God: It hath more
Counsell and strength than all the world besides; and
will certainely either gaine or ruine, convert or subvert
every man that opposes it. I hope ingenuous
men will rather take advice, then offence at what I
have said: I had rather please ten, than grieve one
intelligent man.



If this side be resolute, I turne me to the other.



Goe on brave Englishmen, in the name of God, go
on prosperously, because of Truth and Righteousnes:
Yee that have the Cause of Religion, the life of your
Kingdome and of all the good that is in it in your
hands: Goe on undauntedly: As you are Called and
Chosen, so be faithfull: Yee fight the battells of the
Lord, bee neither desidious nor perfidious: You serve[Pg 83]
the King of Kings, who stiles you his heavenly Regiments:
Consider well, what impregnable fighting
it is in heaven, where the Lord of Hosts is your Generall,
his Angells your Colonels, the Stars your fellow-souldiers,
his Saints your Oratours, his Promises
your victuallers, his Truth your Trenches; where
Drums are Harps, Trumpets joyfull sounds; your
Ensignes Christs Banners; where your weapons and
armour are spirituall, therefore irresistable, therefore
impierceable; where Sun and wind cannot disadvantage
you, you are above them; where hell it selfe
cannot hurt you, where your swords are furbushed
and sharpened by him that made their metall, where
your wounds are bound up with the oyle of a good
Cause, where your blood runs into the veynes of
Christ, where sudden death is present martyrdome and
life; your funeralls resurrections, your honour glory;
where your widows and babes are received into perpetuall
pensions; your names listed among Davids
Worthies; where your greatest losses are greatest
gaines; and where you leave the troubles of war, to
lye down in downy beds of eternall rest.

What good will it doe you, deare Countrymen, to
live without lives, to enjoy England without the
God of England, your Kingdome without a Parliament,
your Parliament without power, your Liberties
without stability, your Lawes without Justice, your
honours without vertue, your beings without wel-being,
your wives without honesty, your children
without morality, your servants without civility, your
lands without propriety, your goods without immunity,
the Gospel without salvation, your churches with[Pg 84]out
Ministery, your Ministers without piety, and all
you have or can have, with more teares and bitternesse
of heart, than all you have and shall have will sweeten
or wipe away?

Goe on therefore Renowned Gentlemen, fall on
resolvedly, till your hands cleave to your swords, your
swords to your enemies hearts, your hearts to victory,
your victories to triumph, your triumphs to the everlasting
praise of him that hath given you Spirits to
offer your selves willingly, and to jeopard your lives
in high perils, for his Name and service sake.

And Wee your Brethren, though we necessarily
abide beyond Jordan, and remaine on the American
Sea-coasts, will send up Armies of prayers to the
Throne of Grace, that the God of power and goodnesse,
would incourage your hearts, cover your heads,
strengthen your arms, pardon your sinnes, save your
soules, and blesse your families, in the day of Battell.
Wee will also pray, that the same Lord of Hosts,
would discover the Counsels, defeat the Enterprizes,
deride the hopes, disdaine the insolencies, and wound
the hairy scalpes of your obstinate Enemies, and yet
pardon all that are unwillingly misled. Wee will
likewise helpe you beleeve that God will be seen on
the Mount, that it is all one with him, to save by
many or few, and that he doth but humble and try you
for the present, that he may doe you good at the latter
end. All which hee bring to passe who is able to
doe exceeding abundantly, above all we can aske or
thinke, for his Truth and mercy sake in Jesus Christ.


Amen. Amen.
[Pg 85]




A Word of IRELAND:


Not of the Nation universally, nor of any man in
it, that hath so much as one haire of Christianity
or Humanity growing on his head or beard,
but onely of the truculent Cut-throats,
and such as shall take up Armes
in their Defence.



These Irish anciently called Antropophagi,
man-eaters: Have a Tradition among them,
That when the Devill shewed our Saviour all the
kingdomes of the Earth and their glory, that he would
not shew him Ireland, but reserved it for himselfe:
it is probably true, for he hath kept it ever since for
his own peculiar; the old Fox foresaw it would eclipse
the glory of all the rest: he thought it wisdome to
keep the land for a Boggards for his unclean spirits
imployed in this Hemisphere, and the people, to doe
his Son and Heire, I mean the Pope, that service for
which Lewis the eleventh kept his Barbor Oliver,
which makes them so blood-thirsty. They are the
very Offall of men, Dregges of Mankind, Reproach
of Christendome, the Bots that crawle on the Beast
taile, I wonder Rome it self is not ashamed of them.

I begge upon my hands and knees, that the Expedition
against them may be undertaken while the[Pg 86]
hearts and hands of our Souldiery are hot, to whom
I will be bold to say briefly: Happy is he that shall
reward them as they have served us, and Cursed be
he that shall do that work of the Lord negligently,
Cursed be he that holdeth back his Sword from blood;
yea, Cursed be he that maketh not his Sword starke
drunk with Irish blood, that doth not recompense
them double for their hellish treachery to the English,
that maketh them not heaps upon heaps, and
their Country a dwelling place for Dragons, an Astonishment
to Nations: Let not that eye look for
pity, nor that hand to be spared, that pities or spares
them, and let him be accursed, that curseth not them
bitterly.




[Pg 87]
A Word of Love to the Common People
of England.


It is, your, now or never, to muster up puissant
Armies of Prayers to the Mercy Seate; your Body
Representative, is now to take in hand, as intricate
a piece of worke, as ever fell into the hands of any
Parliament in the world, to tye an indissoluble knot
upon that webb which hath been woven with so
much cost and bloud, wherein if they happen to make
one false maske, it may re-imbarque themselves and
you all into a deadly relapse of scorne and calamity. It
is the worke of God not of man, pray speedily therefore,
and speedingly, give him no rest till your rest be
throughly re-established, Your God is a God whose
Name is All-sufficient, abundant in Goodnesse and
Truth, on whom the Sonnes of Iacob never did, nor
shall call in vaine, you have a Throne of Grace wherto
you may goe boldly; a Christ to give you a leading
by the hand and liberty of speech, an Intercessor in
Heaven to offer up your Prayers wrapp'd in his own;
a large Charter aske and have, a Spirit to helpe all
your infirmities in that duty, a sure Covenant that
you shall be heard, and such late incouragement as
may strengthen your feeble hands for ever. If you
who may command God concerning the work of his
hand, shall faile to demand the workemanship of his[Pg 88]
hand in this worke, your children will proclaime you
un-thrifts with bitter teares to the worlds end.

If you see no cause to pray, read


Jer. 18. 1.-10.


Be also intreated to have a continuall and conscientious
care not to impeach the Parliament in the hearts
one of another by whispering complaints, easilier told
then tryed or trued. Great bodyes move but slowely,
especially when they move on three leggs and are
over-loden with weighty occasions. They have now
sate full six years without intermission to continue
your being, many of their heads are growne gray with
your cares, they are the High Councell of the Kingdome,
the great Gilead of your Balme, the Phisitians
of all your sicknesse; if any of them doe amisse,
blame yourselves, you chose them, be wiser hereafter;
you cannot doe the State, your selves, your posterity
a more ungratefull office then to impaire them with
disparagements and discoragements who are so studious
to repaire your almost irreparable ruines.

Be likewise beseeched, not to slight good ministers,
whom you were wont to reverence much, they are
Gods Embassadours, your Ephods, your Starres, your
Horse-men       Chariots, your Watchmen,       under
Christ your Salvation, I know no deadlier Symptome
of a dying People than to undervalue godly Ministers,
whosoever despiseth them shall certainly be despised
of God and men at one time or other.[Pg 89]



A most humble heel-piece.
to the
Most Honourable Head-piece
the
Parliament of England.

I Might excuse my selfe in Part, with a speech
Lycurgus used in the like exigent of State, senectute
fio audacior, publica necessitate loquacior, but it
much better becomes mee with all lowlinesse and
uprightnesse, wherein I have failed to pray pardon on
both my knees, which I most humbly and willingly
doe; only, before I rise, I crave leave to present this
six-fold Petition.

That you would be pleased

To preserve the Sacred reputation of Parliaments,
or, wee shall have no Common-wealth.

To uphold the due estimation of good Ministers,
else, we shall have no Church.

To heale the sad dislocation of our Head, throughly, perfectly,
or, wee shall have no King.[Pg 90]

To oppugne the bold violation of divine Truths,
else wee shall have no God.

To proceed with what zeale you began,
or what you began can come to little end.

To expedite worke with what speede you safely may,
else ignorant people will feare they shall
have no end at all.

Hee that is great in Counsell, and Wonderfull in
Working, guide and helpe you in All things, that
doing All things in Him, by Him, and for Him,
you may doe All things like Him.


So be it.
[Pg 91]




A respective word to the Ministers
of ENGLAND.


Farre bee it from mee, while I dehort others
to slight you my selfe, or to despise any man
but myselfe, whom I can never despise enough: I
rather humbly intreate you to forgive my boldnesse,
who have most just cause to judge my selfe lesse and
lesse faithfull than the least of you all, yet I dare not
but bee so faithfull to you and my selfe, as to say

They are the Ministers of England, that have lost
the Land; for Christs sake, put on His bowels, His
wisdome, His zeale, and recover it.[Pg 92]

I pray let me drive in half a dozen plaine honest
Country Hobnailes, such as the Martyrs were
wont to weare; to make my work hold the
surer; and I have done.


1.
There, lives cannot be good,
There, Faith cannot be sure,
Where Truth cannot be quiet,
Nor Ordinances pure.

2.
No King can King it right,
Nor rightly sway his Rod;
Who truely loves not Christ,
And truely fears not God.

3.
He cannot rule a Land,
As Lands should ruled been,
That lets himself be rul'd
By a ruling Romane Queen.

4.
No earthly man can be
True Subject to this State;
Who makes the Pope his Christ,
An Heretique his Mate.

5.
There Peace will goe to War,
And Silence make a noise:
Where upper things will not
With nether equipoyse.[Pg 93]

6.
The upper world shall Rule,
While Stars will run their race:
The nether world obey,
While People keep their place.



The Clench.


If any of these come out
So long 's the world doe last:
Then credit not a word
Of what is said and past.





[Pg 94]
ERRATA
AT NON
CORRIGENDA.


Now I come to rubbe over my work, I finde five
or six things like faults, which would be mended
or commended, I know not well which, nor greatly
care.


1. For Levity, read, Lepidity,                and that a
very little, and that very necessary, if not unavoydable.


Misce stultitiam Consiliis brevem
       Dulce est desipere in loco.      Horat.


To speak to light heads with heavy words, were to
break their necks: to cloathe Summer matter, with
Winter Rugge, would make the Reader sweat. It is
musick to me, to heare every Dity speak its spirit in
its apt tune: every breast, to sing its proper part, and
every creature, to expresse it self in its naturall note:
should I heare a Mouse roare like a Beare, a Cat lowgh
like an Oxe, or a Horse whistle like a Red-breast, it
would scare                mee.


The world's a well strung fidle, mans tongue the quill,
That fills the world with fumble for want of skill,
When things and words in tune and tone doe meet,
The universall song goes smooth and sweet.
[Pg 95]

2. For audacity, read, veracity, or Verum Gallice
non libenter audis. Mart. Flattery never doth well,
but when it is whispered through a paire of lisping
teeth; Truth best, when it is spoken out, through a
paire of open lips. Ye make such a noyse there, with
Drums and Trumpets, that if I should not speak loud,
ye could not hear me: Ye talke one to another, with
whole Culvering and Canon; give us leave to talk
Squibs and Pistoletto's charged with nothing but powder
of Love and shot of Reason: if you will cut such
deep gashes in one anothers flesh, we must sow them
up with deep stitches, else ye may bleed to death:
ye were better let us, your tender Countrymen doe it,
than forraine Surgeons, who will handle you more
cruelly, and take no other pay, but your Lives and
Lands.


                              Aspice vultus,
Ecce meos, utinamque oculos in pectore posses
Inserere:       patrias intus deprendere Curas.
(Ovid. Ph       b.



He that to tall men speakes, must lift up 's head,
And when h' hath done, must set it where he did:
He that to proud men talkes, must put on pride;
And when h' hath done, 'tis good to lay 't aside.


3. For, Yes, but you speak at three thousand miles
distance, which every Coward dare doe, read, if my
heart deceives me not, I would speak thus, in the Presence
Chamber or House of Commons; hoping Homer
will speak a good word for me.[Pg 96]


                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
                                          .               



Omnibus in rebus potior vir fortis       audax
Sit licet hospes,                longinquis venerit oris.



When Kings are lost, and Subjects cast away,
A faithfull heart should speak what tongue can say:
It skils not where this faithfull heart doth dwell,
His faithfull dealing should be taken well.


4. For, affected termes, read, I hope not                If
I affect termes, it is my feeblenesse; friends that
know me, thinke I doe not: I confesse, I see I have
here and there taken a few finish stitches, which may
haply please a few Velvet eares; but I cannot now
well pull them out, unlesse I should seame-rend all.
It seemes it is in fashion with you to sugar your papers
with Carnation phrases, and spangle your speeches
with new quodled words. Ermins in Minifer is
every mans Coat: Yet we heare some are raking in
old musty Charnel books, for old mouldy monosyllables;
I wish they were all banisht to Monmouthshire,
to returne when they had more wit.


Multa renascentur qu        jam cecidere, cadentque
Qu        nunc sunt in honore vocabula, si volet usus.
(Hor.


I honour them with my heart, that can expresse
more than ordinary matter in ordinary words: it is a
pleasing eloquence; them more, that study wisely
and soberly to inhance their native language; them
most of all, that esteeme the late significant speech,[Pg 97]
the third great blessing of the Land; it being so enriched,
that a man may speak in many tongues in his
Mothers mouth; and an uplandish Rusticke, more in
one word than himselfe and all the Parish understands.
Affected termes are unaffecting things to solid hearers;
yet I hold him prudent, that in these fastidious
times, will helpe disedged appetites with convenient
condiments, and bangled ears, with pretty quicke
pluckes. I speake the rather because, not long since,
I met with a book, the best to mee I ever saw, but
the Bible; yet under favour, it was somewhat underclad,
especially by him who can both excogitate and
expresse what hee undertakes, as well as any man I
know.


The world is growne so fine in words and wit,
That pens must now Sir Edward Nich'las it.
He that much matter speaks, speaks ne'r a whit,
If 's tongue doth not career 't above his wit.


5. For, You verse it simply, what need have we of
your thin Poetry; read, I confesse I wonder at it my
self, that I should turne Poet: I can impute it to
nothing, but to the flatuousnesse of our diet: they
are but sadden raptures soone up, soone downe.

       Deductum dicere Carmen, is highly commended
by Macrobius.

Virgil himselfe said,
Agrestem tenui meditabor arundine musam.[Pg 98]


Poetry's a gift wherein but few excell;
He doth very ill, that doth not passing well.
But he doth passing well, that doth his best,
And he doth best, that passeth all the rest.


6. For tediousnesse, read, I am sorry for it                Wee
have a strong weaknesse in N. E. that when wee
are speaking, we know not how to conclude: wee
make many ends, before we make an end: the fault
is in the Climate; we cannot helpe it though we
can, which is the Arch infirmity in all morality:
We are so near the West pole, that our Longitudes
are as long, as any wise man would wish, and somewhat
longer. I scarce know any Adage more gratefull,
than Grata brevitas.


Verba confer maxime ad compendium.    Plaut.



Coblers will mend, but some will never mend,
But end, and end, and end, and never end.
A well-girt houre gives every man content,
Sixe ribs of beefe, are worth sixe weeks of Lent.


For, all my other faults, which may bee more and
greater than I see, read, I am heartily sorry for them,
before I know them, lest I should forget it after; and
humbly crave pardon at adventure, having nothing
that I can think of, to plead but this,


Quisquis inops peccat, minor est reus.    Petron.



Poore Coblers well may fault it now and then,
They'r ever mending faults for other men.
And if I worke for nought, why is it said,
This bungling Cobler would be soundly paid?[Pg 99]

So farewell England old
If evill times ensue,
Let good men come to us,
Wee'l welcome them to New.

And farewell Honor'd Friends,
If happy dayes ensue,
You'l have some Guests from hence,
Pray welcome us to you.

And farewell simple world,
If thou'lt thy Cranium mend,
There is my Last and All,
And a Shoem-Akers
END.



Postscript.



This honest Cobler has done what he might:
That Statesmen in their Shoes might walk upright.
But rotten Shoes of Spannish running-leather:
No Coblers skill, can stitch them strong together.
It were best to cast such rotten stuff away:
And look for that, that never will decay.

If all were shod with Gospel's lasting Peace;
Hatred abroad, and Wars at home would cease.
Jerome Bellamie.

LETTER TO REV. JOHN COTTON.

Salutem in Xto nostro.


Reverend and dear friend,


I was yesterday convented before the bishop, I mean
to his court, and am adjourned to the next term. I see
such giants turn their backs, that I dare not trust my
own weak heart. I expect measure hard enough and must
furnish apace with proportionable armour. I lacke a
friend to help buckle it on. I know none but Christ himself
in all our coast fitt to help me, and my acquaintance
with him is hardly enough to hope for that assistance my
weak spirit will want, and the assaults of tentation call
for. I pray therefore forget me not and believe for me
also if there be such a piece of neighbourhood among
Christians. And so blessing God with my whole heart
for my knowledge of you and immerited interest in you,
and thanking you entirely for that faithful love I have
found from you in many expressions of the best nature,
I commit you to the unchangeable love of God our Father
in his son Jesus Christ, in whom I hope to rest for
ever.


Your's in all truth of heart
Nath'L. Warde.

Stondon Mercy,
Dec. 13. 1631.

"Of the Ninth Church of Christ gathered at Ipswitch.

"This year [1634] came over a farther supply of Eminent
instruments for furthering this admirable Worke
of his, amongst whom the Reverend and judicious servant
of Christ Mr. Nathaniel Ward, who tooke up his station at
the Towne of Ipswich," "scituated on a faire and delightfull
River," "in the Saggamooreship, or Earldom of Aggawam."
"The peopling of this Towne is by men of good ranke and
quality, many of them having the yearly Revenue of large
Lands in England before they came to this Wildernesse,
but their Estates being imployed for Christ, and left in
banke as you have formerly heard, they are well content till
Christ shall be pleased to restore it againe to them or theirs.

"Their meeting-house is a very good prospect to a great
part of the Towne, and beautifully built, the Church of
Christ here consists of about one hundred and sixty soules,
being exact in their conversation, and free from the Epidemicall
Disease of all Reforming Churches, which under
Christ is procured by their pious Learned and Orthodox
Ministery, as in due place (God willing) shall be declared,
in the meane time, look on the following Meeters concerning
that Souldier of Christ Master Nathaniel Ward.


Thou ancient Sage, come Ward among
Christs folfe,[5] take part in this great worke of his,
Why do'st thou stand and gaze about so long;
Do'st war in jest, why, Christ in earnest is,
And hath thee arm'd with weapons for that end,
To wound and heale his enemies submitting,
Not carnally, then to this worke attend;
Thou hast prevail'd the hearts of many hitting.
Although the Presbytery unpleasant jar,
And errors daily in their braines new coyne:
Despayer not, Christs truth they shall not mar;
But with his helpe such drosse from Gold refine.
What Man do'st meane to lay thy Trumpet downe?
Because thy son like Warrier is become,
Hold out or sure lesse bright will be thy crowne,
Till death Christs servants labour is not done."

LETTER FROM GYLES FYRMIN TO GOV. WINTHROP.


Much honoured and deare Sir,


But that I thinke it needlesse (God havinge more than
ordinarye fitted you for such trials) my letter might
tell you with what griefe of spirit I received the news of
that sad affliction which is lately happened to your worship,
by means of that unfaithful wretch; I hope God will find
a shoulder to helpe you beare so great a burthen. But the
little time there is allotted me to write I must spend in requesting
your worships counsel and favour. My father in
law Ward, since his sonne came over, is varey desirous that
wee might sett down together, and so that he might leave
us together if God should remove him from hence. Because
that it cannot be accomplished in this town, is verey desirous
to get mee to remove with him to a new plantation. After
much perswasion used, consideringe my want of accommodation
here (the ground the town having given mee lying 5
miles from mee or more) and that the gaines of physick will
not finde mee with bread, but, besides, apprehendinge that it
might bee a way to free him from some temptations, and
make him more cheereful and serviceable to the country or
church, have yeelded to him. Herein, as I desire your counsel,
so I humbly request your favour, that you would be pleased
to give us the libertye of choosinge a plantation; wee
thinke it will be at Pentuckett, or Quichichchek, by Shawshin:
So soon as the season will give us leave to goe, wee
shall informe your worship which we desire: And if that,
by the court of election, we cannot gather a company to
beegine it, wee will let it fall. Wee desire you would not
graunt any of them to any before wee have seene them. If
your worship have heard any relation of the places, wee
should remaine thankful to you, if you would bee pleased to
counsel us to any of them. Further, I would entreate for advise
in this: The towne gave mee the ground (100 acres)
upon this condition, that I should stay in the towne 3 yeeres,[Pg 103]
or else I could not sell it: Now my father supposes it being
my first heritage (my father having none in the land) that it
is more than they canne doe to hinder mee thus, when as
others have no business, but range from place to place, on
purpose to live upon the countrey. I would entreate your
counsel whither or noe I canne sell it. Further: I am
strongly sett upon to studye divinitie, my studyes else must
be lost: for physick is but a meene helpe. In these cases
I humbly referre to your worship, as my father, for your
counsel, and so in much haste, with my best services presented
to your worship, wishinge you a strong support in
your affliction, and a good and comfortable issue, I rest

Your worships in what he canne to his power,


Ipswich, 26. 10th 1639.                      Gyles Fyrmin.


Wee humbly entreate your secrecye in our desires.

Transcriber's Notes

Corrections to more evident typographical errors are listed here,
together with handwritten or penned changes and additions to the text,
where they appear to be errata (in several cases backed up by an earlier
print of the same text):

Page 5: changed comma to semi-colon (... James, who practised medicine;)

Page 5: changed "cotemporaries" to "contemporaries" (... estimated by
his contemporaries and successors.)

Page 15: changed period and upper case "H" to comma and lower case "h"
(... when he said, he had rather the Earth should swallow him up ...)

Page 34: handwritten insertion "one" ( ... to help them frisk from [one]
ill-favor'd fashion to another.)

Page 70: handwritten insertion "of" ( ... the luxury [of] your Court and
Country, ...)

Page 79: handwritten change of word order from "not let" to "let not"
(I pray not let Britanicus scape, ...)

Page 85: handwritten insertion "s" ( ... the Bots that crawle on the
Beast[s] taile, ...)

Page 97: strikethrough deletion "in" ( ... that a man may speak [in]
many tongues in his Mothers mouth; ...)


Other changes to the text are listed here, where the printer evidently
used alternative type:

Pages 1, 7       8: changed "VV" to "W" (THE SIMPLE COBLER OF AGGAWAM IN
AMERICA.)

Page 10 onwards: changed "J" to "I".
"J" was used for "I" on some pages and not others - which suggests it was a limitation of typesetting, not intended by the author.

Page 47: changed "VVhen" to "When" (When Christ whips Market-makers out
of his Temple, ...)

Page 103 (heading): changed "i646" to "1646" (November 25o 1646.)

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
