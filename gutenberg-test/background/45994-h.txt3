PREFACE


The name Cossacks is given to a large part
of the Russian population. These people are
endowed with special privileges in return for
specific military service. They are of different
racial origin. There are ten separate voiskos,
settled along the frontiers, those of the Don,
Kuban, Terek, Astrakan, Ural, Orenburg, Siberian,
Semir-yechensk, Amur, and Ussuri.
These differ in many respects, though with a
similar military organization, the primary unit
of which is the stanitsa or administrative village.

The historical Cossacks are those of the Don
and of the Dnieper Rivers in Russia, of whom
it has been said that they were "originally passionate
lovers of freedom who went forth to[vi]
find it in the wilderness." The other Cossack
divisions have been patterned after these by the
Government. In the later sections the military
spirit and the old Cossack traditions are carefully
fostered.

Our book deals with the Ussuri Cossacks of
Siberia, among whom Colonel Postnikov lived
for many years, both as an officer and as a civil
engineer. Although the story is written in the
first person, it is in no sense an autobiography
of the author, who was born in western Russia.

Besides the country around Ussuri River,
other sections of Siberia and other classes of
people than the Cossacks are described incidentally.

In the spelling of Russian names, an endeavor
has been made to give some idea of the
actual pronunciation.


The Editor.

Our Little Cossack Cousin
in Siberia




CHAPTER I
CHILDHOOD ADVENTURE


No, indeed, we don't sleep through our Siberian
winters, nor do we coddle ourselves hanging
around a fire,       not we Cossack[1] children.

I was brought up in Eastern Siberia, in a Russian
settlement, on the Ussuri River, about fifty
or sixty miles from where it joins the Amur.
These settlements, you ought to know, were
first established in the year 1857, in order to
show the neighboring Manchus where Russian
boundaries ended. The first were along the
Amur, the later along the Ussuri River. No[2]
doubt I owe much of my hardiness to the fact
that my ancestors were among the involuntary
pioneers sent here by our government.[2]

The source of the Ussuri is so far south that
in the early spring there is always danger of
a sudden breaking of the ice near its mouth
and a consequent overflow. Now it is strange,
but whenever we children were forbidden to
go on the river something would tempt us to
do it.

"You mustn't go on the ice, Vanka," father
said to me one day as he left for Habarovsk,
the nearest big city.

I remembered the command all right until
I met my chum Peter. He had a fine new sled[3]
to show me. It could go so swiftly that when
he proposed that we cross to the Manchurian
side, I said quite readily, "Whee! That'll be
grand; it isn't far, and we can get back in no
time!"

Peter was on the sled which I was pulling,
when we neared the low Chinese banks of the
forbidden river. They were not as near as
they had seemed. It had taken us a full half
hour to cross, although we ran all the way, taking
turns on the sled. Suddenly Peter called
out in a strange tone of voice: "Stop, Vanka,
stop! We must run. Look! Hongoose!"[3]

I stopped so suddenly as almost to throw
Peter off of the sled, and saw three Manchurians
on the bank. They were standing near their
horses who had huge bundles slung across their
backs.

"Why," I said slowly, resolved not to be
frightened, "those are merchants."
[4]
"No," said Peter, his lips trembling; "they
have rifles."

"Ye-es," I reluctantly admitted; "but see
their big bundles. They are certainly traders."

"We had better run       " began Peter stubbornly,
turning from me.



"RODE AT FULL GALLOP TOWARDS US"


"You're nothing but a baba (old woman),"
I said contemptuously, a tingle of shame covering
my cheeks at the mere thought of me,
a Cossack boy, running from a Chinaman.
What would my father say, or my grandfather?
Whoever heard of their doing such a thing?
Yet, to my great surprise, my knees trembled
as I recalled a scene of two years ago, when
the brave Cossack Kontuska was found two
miles from our village with his head smashed
open, and it had been decided that he had been
murdered by the Hongoose. Then, with a certain
feeling of being protected, there also
flashed through my mind a picture of the revenge
expedition that the Cossacks had organized,[5]
and even of the Chinese horse that had
been brought later, as one of the spoils, to my
own home.

As we stood thus, one of the Manchus suddenly
threw the bundles from off his horse,
and, leaping on it, rode at full gallop towards
us. I caught my breath, yet instinctively picked
up a huge piece of ice, while Peter raised the
sled into the air with both his hands.

It was a regular Siberian winter morning,
dry and clear. The sun was still in the east
over the high Russian bank, so that it fell full
on the approaching Chinaman, as we called
him. The snow flew out like sparks of fire
from under the hoofs of his horse, accompanied
by a peculiar crunching sound. When a few
hundred feet from us, the Manchurian changed
the gallop to an easy trot.

"How a ma?"[4] he said, when he had come
up, surveying us with a broad smile.
[6]
With a deep feeling of relief something
made me recognize the fact that he had not
come to slay but merely to satisfy his curiosity.
I noticed the round red circular spot on
his breast as well as the red ball on his cap.
These, I knew, indicated that he was a regular
army officer. With an awkward show of
friendship he turned us round and round, touching
our clothes, looking inside of our hats, and
then said something which puzzled us. But
when he had twice repeated, "Shango-shango,"
I understood that it meant that all was right,
but whether it related to our clothes or to us,
I hadn't any idea.

To show that I wasn't afraid, I shook my
fist at him saying, "You are bushango."[5]

He understood, and smiling good-naturedly
said in broken Russian: "No, no, me shango
too." Then, opening his fur coat and putting
one hand under it, he pulled out something[7]
wrapped in a small piece of rice paper.
This he opened. It contained a few cookies
smelling of peanut oil, and these he smilingly
offered to us.

I leaned heavily first on one foot, then on
the other, while Peter looked sideways, unable
to decide whether it would be proper to accept
such a gift from a Chinaman or not; but
tempted by a desire to show it to our parents,
we took it shyly. "How interested mother
will be," I thought, quite forgetful of my disobedience.
Mother, however, never got a
glimpse of the treat; every crumb was eaten
long before we got half way back.

When I reached home, I found mother in a
very nervous state of mind. Some one had
spread the report of our trip across the border,
and in her anxiety she imagined all sorts
of terrible things to be happening to us.

No sooner did she see me than she put down
my baby sister, who had fallen asleep in her[8]
arms, and embraced me. A moment after she
still further relieved her wrought up feelings
by giving me a sound whipping, and still later,
after I had washed myself and had had my
dinner, both she and my older sister listened
with many questions to very minute particulars
of our little adventure.

settle with their families along the Amur River. Here they
were divided into small villages or stanitsas (Cossack posts)
about fifteen miles apart. The land was then for the most
part a wilderness. There were forests to be cleared and
marshes to be drained. In addition to doing this pioneer
work the Cossacks had to defend the frontier toward China
and provide postal communications between the Amur and
the section from which they had come.       The Editor.

CHAPTER II

THE FIRST DEER OF THE SEASON


It was April. Winter was over, but the
sun had not yet had time to melt the ice in
our part of the river when the alarm was given
that the Ussuri had broken loose a hundred
miles above us and was rushing toward our village
at tremendous speed.

This news was brought by an officer who
had been sent to give orders that the river be
dynamited at once to remove the ice blockade.

I was awakened that night by a terrible noise
resembling hundreds of guns shot in rapid
succession. My first impression was that the
officer and his assistants were blowing up the
ice, but I soon learned differently.

When I had dressed and come out, I could
see that it was caused entirely by the breaking[10]
of the ice. All the village, including babes in
arms, were already on the banks. It was not
light enough to see the whole picture, but in
the half darkness the moving white field of
ice blocks resembled now a herd of mysterious
animals, fighting among themselves, jumping
on one another, and roaring, as they rushed
headlong toward the north, or then again more
like spirits driven from paradise, and making
their way into the unknown with cries and wails,
in desperate panic and fear.

We stood there for two or three hours watching
the ice blocks, many of them three or four
feet thick and hundreds of feet long, pushed
out on the shore by their neighbors, to be in
their turn broken by new masses of blocks.
When the sun arose the picture instead of mysterious
became magnificent. As far as one
could see there was a moving field of blocks
of ice, gleaming in rainbow colors, apparently
changing shapes at every moment. Those[11]
nearest to us rushed with the greatest velocity,
the middle blocks moved more slowly, and those
toward the low Chinese shore seemed merely
a moving stretch of snow.

I had just noted that the river which I was
accustomed to see far below our high bank,
now almost rose to its level, when I heard
quick, excited exclamations around me:
"Deer! Deer!"

I turned to where the hands were pointing
and saw a strange sight. Several of the small
deer that we Siberians called koza, were sailing
on a big block of ice in the middle of the
stream. A moment after every person was
in motion, even the women running home for
rifles. I remained with only a few old men
who muttered: "The fools! How could
they get them so far away, even if they should
happen to shoot them?"

But the hunter instinct, or perhaps the strong
desire to get this particular kind of food, made[12]
every one reject the apparent impossibility of
getting the booty from this terrible roaring
river, carrying everything so swiftly away.

The animals approached nearer and nearer.
We could see their occasional desperate efforts
to jump from one block to another, always to
return to the big block which quietly and majestically
flowed among hundreds of smaller
ones, which pushed around it, now breaking
their edges, now leaving a part of themselves
on its surface.

In a short time the deer were directly opposite
us. There were five of them, a big stag
and four does.

Suddenly there was a rapid succession of
shots around me from the men who had returned.
The stag fell, killed, I afterwards
learned, by my uncle who had aimed at it as
being the most precious. Two of the does also
fell, but the two remaining started on a wild
race for the Chinese shore. One of them was[13]
obviously wounded, for after two or three slow
bounds she was caught by the moving mass of
ice and disappeared under the water. I followed
the other with a certain amount of sympathy
until it was nothing but a tiny dot, and
then turned my attention to what was going on
around me.

There was great excitement. An old Cossack
named Skorin, was trying to stop his nineteen-year-old
son and two others from the mad
attempt to push a boat on to the stream, in order
to go after the slain animals. These had
been pushed gradually nearer us by the ice, and
Young Skorin argued that it would be easy to
get them.

I noticed that this dispute was being listened
to by our friend Che-un, a member of the Goldi
tribe, one of the native Siberian races, who had
lived near our village as far back as I could
remember. He was regarded with considerable
kindly respect by the Cossacks as being the[14]
most experienced hunter and fisher among them.
He had on, as usual, his winter costume which
made him look like a bundle of fur. It consisted
of a nicely made deerskin coat, deerskin
trousers and boots. His dark face, with
its flat nose, its sparkling, black, almond-shaped
eyes, was all attention.

Old Skorin turned to him. "Tell this madman,"
he said, "that it is certain death to
try to get into the stream now."

Without giving him a chance to reply, Young
Skorin burst out: "Say, Che-un, tell father
how I crossed during last year's flood."

The Goldi did not answer at once. Instead,
he puffed two or three times through the long
pipe which he always held in his mouth. Then,
slowly pulling it out, he said brokenly, "Were
it a bear, I might go       but for deer       no."

"Oh, come on," said Young Skorin persuasively.
"If you won't, I'll go with Vassili
here. Come on, Vassili," and, with a reckless[15]
laugh, and without paying further heed to
the protests of his father, he made a bound
to his boat which was lying among others on
the snowy bank.

All of these boats were of the light Goldi
type, built from three very wide boards, one
about two feet wide, at the bottom, the two
others on the sides, and two small end boards,
all well-seasoned, nailed, and caulked, bent to
meet and generally raised at the bow. All the
boards were well smeared over with tar. Such
a boat can be easily carried by two men, or
pushed along the snow or ice. At the same
time its displacement is so great that five
and sometimes six men can cross a stream in
it.

When the two young men had pushed the
boat over the snow into the river, Young Skorin
took his seat in it while Vassili ran for two
landing forks, a gun, and one oar. When he
returned, Che-un suddenly changed his mind[16]
and joined the daring youths. This gave great
relief to all of the women, who were filled with
anxiety as to the outcome of the boys' crazy
venture.



[17]




CHAPTER III

THE BOOTY SECURED




"IT SEEMED TO ALL OF US THAT THEY COULD NEVER REACH THEIR GOAL"


The boat was soon on the river, partly on
ice and partly in water, and the struggle to
reach the big ice block on which the deer lay,
began. We saw the hooks of the young men
flying now to the left, now to the right of the
boat. Sometimes one end of the boat, sometimes
the other, would be raised high into the
air. Now and then, as the stream carried them
further away, we could distinguish that it had
become necessary for the youths to pull or
push the boat across some ice barrier. As we
strained our eyes watching them, it seemed to
all of us that they could never reach their goal.

Noontime came, and I heard my mother's
call to dinner. I was so hungry by that time,
not having breakfasted, that I answered at[18]
once despite my desire to see the end of the
adventure.

I had scarcely seated myself at the table when
my father and Old Skorin entered.

"You must eat with us, Pavel Ivanovich,"[6]
said my father. "You can't go home. It's
too far. Besides, it's a long time since we've
had a chance to be together."

We all understood father's kind intention of
trying to keep the old man's mind from dwelling
too anxiously on his son's uncertain fate. Besides,
my older sister had just become engaged
to Young Skorin and this drew our families
closer together.

Old Skorin stepped into the room with dignity,
took off his fur cap, and walking to the[19]
corner in which hung the ikon,[7] crossed himself.
Not until he had done this, did he salute
my mother with: "Bread and salt, Anna
Feodorovna," this being the customary greeting
when any one is invited for a meal.

"You are welcome, dear guest, Pavel Ivanovitch,"
was my mother's hearty response. "Take
this seat," and she pointed to the place of honor
under the ikon and to the right of my father.

"Where is Katia?" asked Skorin.

At this question I looked around amazed to
find that Katia was not in the room. I had never
before known her to be absent at meal time.

Mother answered with a trace of discontent
in her voice: "I don't know. The breaking
up of the ice seems to have upset the whole
village. Run, Vanka, and find her."

I left my place at the table with great reluctance,[20]
not daring to offer any protest in
the presence of my father, whose military
training made him insist on prompt obedience.

When I reached the river's bank, I saw my
sister among those yet there. She stood shading
her eyes, in order to still make out the
now scarcely visible boat. Her face expressed
a peculiar mixture of admiration and anxiety.
I recalled that she had had a quarrel with
Young Skorin the night before, which had
probably led to the rash undertaking. Inexperienced
though I was in such matters, I felt
that this venture had somehow resulted in her
complete forgiveness.

When she understood why I had come, her
first question was, "Is father already home?"
Learning that he was, she ran as fast as if
her heels were on fire, so that I could scarcely
keep up with her.

When we reached home the talk turned to
the appearance of the koza, my father saying[21]
that it was a good omen, that we should have
plenty of deer meat that season.

These Siberian deer always move in a succession
of small herds, and are followed and
preyed on not only by men but also by wolves
and other animals. For this reason our cattle
were always safe during their migration.
At this time, too, we always had an abundance
of deer meat three times a day. The skins
were saved either to be immediately made into
fur coats and caps or for future use. Often
on account of the abundance of these skins
many of them were sold to traders who now and
then visited our part of the country.

Every boy in our village learned all about
the habits of the deer in childhood, not only
from his relatives but also from the members
of the neighboring Goldi tribes, or from Manchurians
who use the growing antlers as an
invigorating medicine, considering it almost as
precious as ginseng, which is also found along[22]
the Ussuri River. Sometimes they paid as
high as two or three hundred rubles[8] for a
pair. I knew several Cossacks who made a
fortune hunting deer. They were also profitable
to keep as pets, the horns of the male
being cut off every summer, when just about to
harden, and sold.

We were just through dinner when a shout
came that Young Skorin had been successful.
We rushed out and met him bringing the big
stag to our house. My mother and sister
helped him skin it and cut it into four parts.
Then I was sent around to spread the news
that that evening there would be a big feast
to which the whole village was asked, this to
be followed by a dance for the young people.

Toward evening the guests began to arrive,
many of the men dressed in old uniforms,
many others simply in belted, gayly embroidered
red, blue, and gray blouses. The older[23]
people seated themselves around the table in our
house, while the younger received their share
of the feast informally at our nearest neighbor's,
greatly relieved at being free for a while
from the supervision of their elders.

The meal lasted a long time. There was
first the traditional deer soup of the Cossack,
then roast deer, and finally an unlimited amount
of coarse rye bread, milk, and tea. Vodka,
too, as an especial treat, was offered to the
older people.

When the table had been cleared and moved
out of the way, the blind musician, Foma, with
his fiddle under his arm, was led into a corner.
The son of the head man of our village (the
ataman), took his place next to him with a
harmonica. The dancing began with the
rather slow steps of "Po Ulice Mastovoi"
(On the paved Street), and ended with the
Cossack dance, "Kazachok," led by an old
woman named Daria, and Old Skorin, followed[24]
by more and more active dancers, until
it finally terminated in the dancing of the liveliest
Cossack present, each newly invented stunt
on his part producing an explosion of applause.

During the dance the house was packed with
people. The greatest excitement prevailed.
Men sober enough in everyday life, seemed
suddenly to give expression to something wild in
their natures. By midnight every one present
was so exhilarated that he was either dancing or
beating time. Even Grand-dad Matvei, who
was said to be a hundred years old, kept time
with the music by shrugging his shoulders and
striking his feet against the ground.

All that evening my sister and Young Skorin
were the center of attention, their engagement
having been announced immediately after supper.

CHAPTER IV

A BIG CATCH AND NEW PREPARATIONS


One evening, later in the spring, when our
rivers were entirely free from ice, and the
banks were covered with green grass and primroses,
Peter came suddenly into our barnyard
with: "Quick! Get your spearing fork!
There's fish in the grass."

Without a word, I made several leaps to
the barn where my father kept his fishing implements,
snatched a fork, and followed Peter
in a race to the river.

Just before we reached the bank, Peter
grabbed hold of my hand. "Be quiet," he
said, softly. "Do you see anything?"

I looked on the slightly waving surface of
the river and along the bank, but could see
nothing out of the usual.

[26]

Peter let me gaze for a while and then pointing
to a small inlet formed by a curvature of
the river, where the water was very shallow and
gradually sloped toward the meadow, whispered:
"There!"

My eyes followed the direction of the pointing
finger. The grass of the surrounding
meadow was partially under water, only a few
inches projecting above the level. Here something
attracted my attention. It looked like
a brown comb moving gently back and forth.
"A fin," I whispered, more to myself than to
Peter.

Hardly breathing, we stepped into the water
which reached to our knees, and made our way
toward the brown waving comb of the fish. I
held the fork in readiness and tried to keep between
the fish and the river.

When we were about three or four steps
from the fish, it suddenly threw itself in our
direction, and so swiftly that I had scarcely[27]
time to throw the spear. Then something
struck me on the foot and I fell forward into
the water.

"Hurry," screamed Peter. "Help me."

With my face in mud and water, I could not
at first understand the situation. When I
arose, however, and had wiped my eyes, I was
mad with excitement and joy. The fish had
not reached the stream but was on the sandy
bank, half under water. Peter was pressing
his whole body on it, trying to hold it down.
It was a sazan, extremely big, weighing at least
fifteen pounds, and it took us more than five
minutes to subdue it and carry it to a dry spot.
When this was done I let Peter hold the fish
with his fork while I ran for a sack. In this
we carried the fish home, immensely proud and
boastful of our achievement.

When father returned at night, he expressed
surprise at the size of our catch, adding that
he had heard that day that the keta were expected[28]
soon. This produced more excitement,
for next to bread the most important food of
the Ussuri Cossack is fish, and particularly the
keta, a kind of salmon.

When the keta came from the sea at Nikolaievsk,
they are very fat but get thinner as they
go up stream, it taking several weeks to make
the journey from the mouth of the river to the
source. The Cossacks have to be very active
during the migration, for it lasts only a few
days.

But father had still other news for us which
brought the excitement to a climax. He had
asked the commander of my brother's garrison
to permit Dimitri to return home to help
with the keta fishing!

The day following our big catch, all of the
men of our village set to work patching nets,
sharpening their spearing forks, repairing their
boats, while the women cleaned and got ready
all the different necessary vessels from barrels[29]
to frying pans. Father had brought as much
salt from the town as possible, but it would
only be sufficient for pickling a part of the fish;
the rest would have to be smoked and dried.

While all the village were thus engaged, two
horsemen were seen approaching. They wore
tall fur hats, had swords at their sides, and
guns over their shoulders. Their yellow shoulder
straps and the broad yellow stripes on their
wide trousers which were shoved into high
boots, the silver inlaid handles of their nagaikas
(Cossack whips), all indicated that they
belonged to one of the active divisions of the
Ussuri Cossacks.

Surprised exclamations of "Mitya!" "Phillip!"
"Brother!" "Son!" were heard. I
waved a red handkerchief at them, recognizing
Dimitri's companion as Phillip, a cousin of my
chum Peter. When they reached the village,
they leaped lightly from their horses and
kissed and embraced all present, answering as[30]
they did so the questions and joshing remarks
hurled at them.

I learned that they had come on a two weeks'
leave of absence, and that even father had not
expected them so soon. After the first greeting,
he said reproachfully: "There was no
need for you to hurry so fast. You might
have killed the horses. Why, it's only yesterday
that I saw you."

"Don't be grouchy, father," said Dimitri.
"We walked half of the way. I am very well
aware that a Cossack's first duty is to his horse;
his second to himself." And as if to demonstrate
this, he turned to where I was trying to
climb into his saddle and said seriously: "No,
Vanka, don't worry him now. He is too tired.
Better loosen his saddle girths, take off his
bridle, and lead him to the stable. Don't forget
to put as much straw as possible under his
feet. Don't get on him, or I'll never let you
go near him."

[31]

Although discouraged in my expectation of
a nice ride, I was nevertheless proud of my
brother and his confidence, and led the horse
to a shed which, as was usual in our village,
consisted of three sides only, the fourth, to the
South, being open.

At that moment my mother came running
up. She had not seen Dimitri for more than
a year, and she hung herself on his neck, laughing
and weeping with joy.

Then the interrupted work was resumed.
Dimitri and Phillip left us to change their
clothes, but soon returned and joined heartily
in our preparations.

Part of the men now waded out into an
arm of the river until the water reached to
their breast. Through this arm the fish usually
made their way. Here two fences, separated
by a space of about two hundred feet,
were to be built, one to the Russian bank, the
opposite one from the water to an island in[32]
the river. First, poles three or four inches
thick, were thrust into the river bottom, about
a foot apart, and then willow twigs interwoven
between. The fences were then braced from
behind with posts tied with willow ropes.

When these were finished and the men had
come back to shore, a big fire was kindled.
Standing around it, they took off their wet
clothes and hung them on nearby bushes or
spread them out in the sun.

Old Skorin then pulled a basket with eatables
from under a stone, and also a bottle
containing vodka (brandy), in order, he said,
to keep them from catching cold while standing
around naked after their icy bath. Although
their lips were blue and their teeth
chattered, they laughed and joked as they took
it. People don't complain of things in our
part of the world.

A decidedly cold wind now began to blow
and I was sent to several of the homes for[33]
what clothes I could get. Without, however,
waiting for me to return, they began to spread
the fish nets which were lying in big bundles
on the banks.

I soon came back with some dry things for
the oldest in the party. For Skorin, in addition
to an old army overcoat, I had a pair of
long socks made of heavy wool by his wife.
She had pressed them into my hand at the last
moment, bidding me to be sure to see that her
husband put them on.

Skorin received these with a show of scorn,
mingled, however, with a satisfaction that he
could not disguise. "My wife," he said, "is
always worrying about me. If we Cossacks
gave in to our wives, we'd all be very tender-footed."
But I saw that he pulled on the
socks.

Having performed my commission, I turned
to where about four hundred feet of netting
was already hanging on seven foot high poles.[34]
Men were at work on this, tying up broken
loops and fixing weights to the lower parts.
Long ropes were fastened to the ends. The
work was done with feverish haste. When
my brother and Phillip came running up, another
bundle of nets of about the same size
was unrolled, and the two set to work patching
it, putting all the skill that they possessed
into the work. When the call for dinner came
at noon, the netting was ready for use.

Now a difference of opinion arose, some
wishing to continue until all the nets were finished,
others contending that after a hearty
meal they could complete the work more
quickly. Skorin who despite his age, was the
inspiration of all present, sided with those who
wished to remain, but when some one called his
attention to the fact that Dimitri and Philip had
not breakfasted, he surrendered, and we all
hurried to our homes.



[35]




CHAPTER V

"THE KETA ARE COMING!"


Certain that there would be something extra
for dinner on my brother's account, I ran on
ahead, and as I ran I tried to guess what it
would be. We would have, of course, the
usual borsch (cabbage soup with plenty of
meat, potatoes, and onions, and sometimes the
addition of sour cream), buckwheat kasha
(porridge), and the inevitable tea and rye
bread. But what else? As soon as I burst
into the room, I knew, for mother was just
taking a big fish pie out of the whitewashed
oven in the brick fireplace.

The others came in as I was clapping my
hands with delight, and we all took our seats
around the big table. We had hardly finished
eating our borsch to which, following the example[36]
of my father, I added two big spoonfuls
of buckwheat porridge, when the door
opened and Sonya, Peter's sister, came in so
nearly out of breath that she could hardly
ejaculate the words       "The keta are coming!"

She might have said the enemy, so suddenly
did we all spring to our feet and rush out
shouting the news to all whose homes we
passed. A few minutes after, our boats were
in the water with the nets, and the men at
their assigned places with fishing hooks, hatchets,
and ropes. The women were not behindhand
in coming, not merely to gaze at the
river but to bring necessary utensils.

I had no especial duty assigned me, and so
in trying to help everybody, I managed to be
a nuisance. It was not long before I received
a kick out of the way from my father, who
was assisting Feodor carry a heavy net. This
sent me several feet down the bank.

[37]

Nothing disheartened, I grabbed hold of a
boat which my brother and Young Skorin were
pushing into the water. But they worked so
rapidly that I lost my balance and fell flat
into the edge of the river. My brother caught
me up by the neck, shook me angrily, and tumbling
me up on the bank growled: "Stop
putting yourself where you're not wanted."

I hardly knew what to make of such unusual
treatment from Mitya. To hide the
tears which were ready to fall, I ran as fast
as I could to the top of the bank and got behind
some trees from which I had a good view
of the entire river.

Here I soon forgot how sore I felt. The
fresh damp air was filled with the aromatic
fragrance of opening buds and leaves. For a
mile along the Russian bank, the river shone
mirror-like under the bright rays of the Spring
sun. Its surface was slightly waved by the
wind, except in one place where there was a peculiar[38]
disturbance. Sharp waves and splashes
and two rows of foam indicated the approaching
advance guard of the keta.

Two boats were rowing desperately to their
appointed places on both sides of the opening
between the two fences. Two other boats had
already gone to watch lest the fish should turn
into some other arm. Suddenly the men in
these began to fire shots, no doubt to prevent
the fish from turning. Their maneuver evidently
succeeded, for the fish headed directly
to where the other party awaited them.

As they came nearer and nearer I grew so
excited that I leaped high into the air and
yelled wildly.

Although it was not a big school of fish, it
covered more than two hundred feet. As it
came to the fences there was a great disturbance,
heads and tails and even the entire body
appearing far out of the water. A few individual
fish jumped as high as the very top of[39]
the fence. A very large number became entangled
in the spread nets.

Because of the number of fish, it became difficult
to get the water end of the net back to
land, and, for a while, it looked as if the fish
would escape, nets and all. The hard work
of the men in the boats seemed to accomplish
little. Finally Old Skorin, alone in his light
baidarra,[9] separated himself from the others,
and pulled behind him the end of the rope,
while the others exerted themselves to resist
the pressure of the fish. When he reached the
bank, he wound the rope around some trees
which he used as a block, until he made a sufficiently
strong anchor for the party behind.
Two or three men came to his assistance, and
gradually the far end of the net, filled with an
enormously large number of fish, was brought
on the bank.
[40]
A little behind this net was another net to
get the fish that escaped the first. Many fish,
however, went under both and were soon out
of sight.

The whole village now gathered with vessels
and sacks, knives and hatchets. The fish
were picked up, killed, and carried to improvised
tables, where a row of women and two
strong men started to work at cleaning, salting,
and packing them in barrels. The work
was continued until the salt gave out late at
night. The remainder were left for drying
and smoking on the morrow. All of the work
was done in common; later the fish were divided
among the different families according
to the number of workers in each.

The next morning everything looked gloomy
and muddy, for there had been a shower during
the night, and it was still drizzling. Happening
to recall that the year before at this
fish season the weather had been dry, I ventured[41]
to ask: "Isn't it foolish to try to dry
fish in such wet weather? They'll get wetter
than they now are."

To my chagrin and astonishment, all began to
laugh, and Young Skorin remarked: "They
are rather used to being pretty wet, I fancy."

As I turned from the laughing crowd, who,
as soon as they had cleaned some of the fish,
hung them on ropes stretched in several rows
along the bank, I noticed that "Granny"
Daria and her adopted son were watching the
workers. I soon saw that they were not there
merely out of curiosity but to pick up the spawn
which they washed in a big tank and piled in
a barrel. Later I was told that Daria had
been the first in the village to prepare caviar
for sale. That was the year before, when she
made enough money to purchase a cow in the
city. We all envied her this cow, for in comparison
with our undeveloped Manchurian
cows she gave an enormous amount of milk.

CHAPTER VI

TIGER! TIGER!


I must have been at least a year older when
father came in one evening, his face full of
serious concern. I had just been uttering peculiar
yells to amuse my little sister, but at
once became silent, anxious for him to speak.
As soon as he had warmed his hands a little
at the fire, he turned to me with, "You will
have to go after the cattle, Vanka, and try to
get them into the yard." Then, turning to
my mother, he added, "A tiger[10] was seen in
the valley last night." Mother began to make
some timid objections to my going out because
of the falling snow, but father interrupted
with: "Trifles! He's a Cossack!"
[43]
My mother knew too well my father's conviction
that the same discipline that prevailed
in the camp should be found in the home, to
say more.

I confess that I did not like the task assigned
me. As I reluctantly arose, my mother,
trying not to betray her emotions, bade me put
my fur coat over my blouse. When I had
done so, she herself tied a heavy muffler over
my cap, and then turning from me, pretended
to be absorbed in getting supper. The anxious
look in her eyes, however, had not escaped
me.

When I stepped out of doors, I could not
make out anything at first. The wind was
colder and blowing stronger than in the morning,
and I rubbed my nose, remembering the
half frozen one with which I had returned from
a trip on the river two weeks before, resulting
in a swollen face and a disagreeable daily
greasing with goose fat.

[44]

After a few minutes I made out the fences,
and then the road, down which I stumbled, hoping
to find our cattle clustered as usual, about
a big haystack, half a mile from the village.

The sky, as is customary in Eastern Siberia,
was clear and full of stars. The dazzling
whiteness around gleamed as if covered with
thousands of jewels. More than once a clump
of bushes made me sure that the tiger was a
dozen steps before me.

Suddenly a sinister sound broke the stillness.
I half turned to run, when it was repeated,
and I recognized that it was only a
cracking of the ice in the river below me, so
I continued on, relieved. Snow circles now
began to form around my muffled face and the
deeper snow creaked under my feet. Gradually,
however, all sense of fear left me for
a while. The spirit of adventure, the thought
of accomplishing so difficult a commission, filled
my heart with the determination to do it as[45]
well as though I were a full grown man.

I had gone less than a quarter of a mile
when I began to make out several dark spots
approaching along the trail. Soon I heard
the bleating of a calf, who, evidently trying
to follow its mother, was discontented that
more attention was not paid to it.

"They have scented the tiger," I said to myself,
"and are trying to get home."

For a moment I felt glad that I did not have
to go further. Then it occurred to me that
should the frightened animals unexpectedly see
me, they might run away so that it would be
impossible to find them again that night.

Quickly stepping to one side, I crouched
down next to a little hillock. I was a moment
too late, for the cattle stopped and stood motionless,
gazing toward the spot where I lay.
When they renewed their approach, their rapid
trot had changed to a slow, cautious walk. It
was fortunate that the wind was blowing in my[46]
direction, for they were soon in line with me.
I scarcely breathed until they had passed, when
I leaped up so quickly to follow that I again
frightened them, and they started off on so
mad a rush towards home that they were soon
out of sight.

It was not until then that it occurred to me
that the tiger might have been following the
cattle, that even now he was somewhere near
where I had first caught a glimpse of them.

Panic stricken, I grabbed up the folds of my
heavy coat and ran along the trail like one insane.
Once I stumbled, and it seemed to me
that I felt the tiger's breath on my neck, that
his claws were outstretched to carry me so far
away that even my mother could not find me.

Then, with a hasty glance behind that saw
nothing, I gave a leap forward and continued
my run. At last I caught a glimpse of the
light from our house, which was at one end of
the village; and completely out of breath, I[47]
broke into the kitchen and sank to the floor.

Mother, greatly alarmed, ran up to me, crying
out: "For heaven's sake, Vanka, what's
the matter? Are you hurt? Is the tiger       "

Gasping for breath, I answered weakly,
"Yes, tiger."

This produced a commotion. My older sister
began to cry; my mother caught up the baby
from her warm bed on top of the oven and
kissed her, while father with one leap took his
rifle from the hook and put on his ammunition
belt. Then, taking me by the shoulder, he demanded:
"Where was the tiger?"

I muttered something so unintelligible that
his face cleared somewhat. He evidently perceived
that I was more frightened than the situation
justified. To relieve the tensity of the
atmosphere, he said in quite a natural tone,
"You're scared, Sonny, eh?" Then added
briskly, "Shame on you! Take a lantern and
follow me."

[48]

These words returned to me all my presence
of mind. I jumped up and feeling the necessity
of something being done, ran for the
lantern, lit it, and followed my father who, enveloped
in his fur coat, was already out of
doors.

When my eyes accustomed themselves to the
darkness, I saw that all of our cows were huddled
together near the barn. We drove them
to a corral surrounded by a seven-foot high
fence made of tree trunks.

When sure that all were in, father closed
the gate, and turned to another corral in which
were the horses tied to posts. At first I
thought that he intended to drive them into
the corral with the cows, but soon saw, to
my great surprise, that he had not only untied
them but let them go freely out of the
gates. He even went to a shed reserved
for a highly valued stallion and let him
loose.

[49]

"Why did you do that?" I ventured to ask
him.

"I never heard yet of a loose horse being
caught by a tiger," he replied briefly.

"But the cattle       " I began.

"They're different," he said, "they haven't
the sense to know how to protect themselves.
Besides, they couldn't run fast enough, anyhow."

As we moved about with our lanterns, our
dogs and those of our neighbors kept up a continuous
barking. At last we turned toward the
house, my father remarking as if to himself,
"The tiger is a good way off yet."

"How can you tell?" I asked timidly.

"Why," he answered rather impatiently,
"don't you hear how the dogs are barking?"

"Yes," I said. "Much more than usual."

"More than usual," he repeated after me
with a sarcastic emphasis. "You'll see how
they bark if a tiger ever ventures near our[50]
house. But come, it's time to go in. I'm
worn out. You go ahead, I'll follow as soon
as I've closed the gate."

I skipped to the house, feeling very brave
with my father so near, and listened to the different
voices of the dogs as I did so. That
of little Zushka, who belonged to our nearest
neighbor, seemed ridiculous compared with that
of our wolf-hound, Manjur. I whistled to
Manjur who was about a hundred feet away.
He stopped barking and ran up to me. Hardly
had I begun to pat his head than he suddenly
stiffened with attention, his hair bristling.
Then with a ferocious bark such as I had never
heard before, he disappeared into the darkness.

The moon, which had risen, made the surroundings
quite visible. Turning my head, I
saw my father some distance away standing perfectly
still, his face turned toward the road, his
rifle raised to his shoulder.

[51]

I also stood still, scarcely breathing, until
he set his rifle on the ground. As he did so
he glanced at the house. Seeing me he called
out roughly, "What are you doing here?
Didn't I tell you to go in?"

"Is it a tiger?" I said with teeth chattering.

"I don't know," he answered; "but do as
you're bid."

I had to obey, and stepping in, soon cuddled
myself under the heavy fur coat that served as
my comforter. But though I lay down I could
not fall asleep until my father came in and
quietly but a little more slowly than usual, got
ready for bed.

I heard my mother whisper: "Did the
tiger come?" and father's answer: "I think
so, but for some reason he went away."

"Will he return?" from my mother.

"How do I know?" came impatiently from
my tired father, and I fell asleep.

CHAPTER VII

THE NIGHT ALARM


A few hours before dawn I was awakened
by our dog barking angrily, yet with a peculiar
note showing fear and disdain. I could also
hear him leaping up and down in one spot near
the very door of our house. Instead of answering
barks, the neighboring dogs gave forth
long and deep howls. There was such a noise
and mooing of the cows in the corral that it
seemed to me they must be trying to stamp or
hook each other to death.

Father and mother were already up, and I
heard father's deep command: "Get me a
lantern."

As soon as the match was lit I saw him as
he stood in his night shirt but with his fur hat[53]
on his head and a rifle in his hand. As soon
as the lantern had been lit, he seized it and
rushed to the door, putting on his overcoat as
he ran. I arose hastily, put on my fur coat,
grabbed the hatchet lying by the stove, and
followed just as he cheered on the dog who ran
before him to the corral, barking loudly.



"THE GREAT BEAST .      .      . JUMPED OVER THE SEVEN-FOOT FENCE"


As I came near I saw my father thrust his
rifle hastily between two fence posts. A second
later came a short flash and the report of
the gun. But my father's curses showed that
he had failed to hit the mark. At the same
time, I heard a roar so terrible in its fury and
strength and hate that I trembled so as to
be hardly able to stand. Surely, I thought, a
beast who can produce such a roar can swallow
not only one but several cows at once. How
brave my father seemed to me as, still muttering,
he reloaded his old gun with another cartridge.
But here something happened. The
great beast holding a cow in his teeth as a cat[54]
does a mouse, jumped over the seven-foot fence
of the corral and ran off into the darkness, pursued
by our wolf hound. With what sounded
like the Cossack war cry, father followed, while
I, too, made my way some distance after, this
distance gradually increasing on the snow covered
trail.

We continued in this fashion for perhaps
five minutes, when the dog changed his ferocious
barking to a pitiful whine and a new shot
rang out into the air, followed by a short roar.
I stopped in the middle of the road, unable to
go a step further.

I don't know how long I stood there, but
it was until I heard Manjur returning. I could
just make him out but oh, in what a pitiful condition!
He was limping so badly that at times
he simply dragged his body along the ground.
Tears sprang to my eyes as I heard his cries
and hurried toward him intending to pat him
on the head. But when I tried to do so, my[55]
hand found itself covered with a warm sticky
fluid which I knew to be blood. I could feel
that his skin was torn, one ear gone, and his
left front leg broken.

Helping the dog all I could, I returned crying
to the house. As I stepped into the room
covered with Manjur's blood, my sister Katia
gave a scream, while my mother with terror
written in her eyes, exclaimed: "What's happened
to you? Where is your father?"

"I don't know," I answered; "but see what
the frightful tiger did to poor Manjur."

Mother, somewhat relieved, but still trembling,
now came up and helped me apply
greased bandages to the torn ear and broken
skin of the faithful dog.

While we were doing this, father returned.
Slowly he took off his hat, then his heavy coat,
and in reply to my mother's mute questioning
look, said: "I believe that I must have hit him
for he dropped the cow,       yet he got away."

[56]

"Is she alive?" asked my mother with anxiety.

My father shook his head. "Her neck is
entirely broken," he said, adding, "I hardly
think he'll return to-night. To-morrow we'll
get him, for he's probably hungry and will hang
around." Then he ordered me and my terrified
sister to go to bed in order to get up early,
and busied himself with poor Manjur.

Long after the light was extinguished, I lay
awake thinking of the tiger, my father's courage,
my mother's anxiety, the wounded dog,
and the dear cow. For some time, too, I could
hear the low voices of my father and mother
discussing the preparations for the morrow.
One name, that of Tolochkin, was mentioned
several times. I knew of this Tolochkin as a
wonderful hunter of tigers. I had never seen
him, however, for he lived more than forty
miles away, and was peculiar in his habits, keeping
much to himself.



[57]




CHAPTER VIII

WHAT CAME FROM ATTENDING A SKODKA


The sun's rays were already brightening the
room when I awoke next morning. I jumped
up from the bench that formed my bed at night
and looked around. The fire was burning
brightly in the big stove, mother and sister
were clearing the table. Father was gone!

Quick as a flash, it occurred to me why he was
away. He had gone to a skodka, a gathering
of the villagers who are always called together
when there is a grave matter to be discussed.
My lips trembled in my disappointment, for
I had hoped to go with father.

I dressed hastily, and then grabbing up my
fur cap and coat started for the door. Mother
saw me and called out, "Where are you in[58]
such a hurry to go, you foolish boy? You're
not washed nor combed, nor have you had a
bite to eat."

"I haven't time," I mumbled. "I have to
go to the skodka."

Mother, despite the seriousness of the situation,
burst out laughing. "Do you think you
are necessary," she inquired, "to deciding what
ought to be done?" Then changing her tone
she said, "Hang up your shuba (overcoat),
wash yourself, and breakfast, and then perhaps
you can go."

My pleadings to depart at once were in vain,
and I had to do her bidding. I forgot the disappointment
somewhat, in attacking with relish
the well-prepared buckwheat porridge, rye
bread, and tea. The instant I was through,
nothing could prevent me from running to the
skodka.

When I reached Fedoraev's log house, which
my mother had told me was the place of meeting,[59]
I found the front room filled with neighbors.
Peter, who was at the door under the
low-eaved portico, pointed out a tall, broad-shouldered
man, with a heavy beard and bushy
hair and brows, as the renowned Tolochkin.
I gazed at him with all my might. "How
many tigers has he killed?" I asked Peter in a
whisper.

"Forty!" came the answer. "And you
ought to see the bear and deer skins which I
saw in his yard the latter part of January."

I turned to the man again. I had been told
that he was about fifty years of age, but he
looked about ten or fifteen years younger. I
noticed that he did not say much except to reply
sharply to suggestions and arguments.

"Why won't you come with us, Ivan Stepanovitch?"
I heard the village ataman, the
head man of our village, say to him in a slow,
persuasive voice. "We need you to show our
youths how to hunt tigers. They've got to[60]
learn. We lost five cows and a dozen sheep
last year, and this one rascal alone can ruin us.
We'll give you half the price of the skin."

"I don't care for the company, thank you;
I prefer to hunt tigers single-handed." He
paused and added with a peculiar sarcasm,
"I'm really not needed." Here he arose and
left abruptly.

For several minutes after his departure, no
one spoke. Then I heard my father's voice:
"Since he doesn't want to come, let him stay
away. We're no children to need help. How
many rifles can we count on for to-morrow?"

There came a chorus of "I," "I'm with
you," "Count on me," and then quite involuntarily,
I found myself exclaiming loudly: "I'll
go."

To my surprise everybody found something
amusing just then, for there was a resounding
laugh. A man near the door faced me with,
"Where is your rifle?"

[61]

I looked straight into his eyes and answered
earnestly, "Last year my uncle promised to
give me one of his shotguns."

Again there came a new and stronger explosion
of laughter. What was the matter?
Were they laughing at me?

My uncle came to my rescue. "Brave boy,"
he said, patting me on the shoulder. "I'll
take you if your father consents, and you shall
have a rifle instead of a shotgun. We need
some one to see to our horses."

Then the meeting began to discuss plans.
It was decided that about two hours after midnight
all who were going were to meet outside
of the village at the crossing of the road
to Bear Valley. Only two dogs, wolf hounds
owned by Laddeef, were to be taken.

When I returned home, I said nothing to
my mother of my share in the skodka, but when
shortly after midnight I heard my father's
heavy steps go out to feed the horses, I arose[62]
quietly and dressed, not forgetting my fur overcoat
and cap and my warm felt boots. When
my father returned, his beard white with frost
and snow on his deerskin boots, he looked at
me with a mingling of surprise and satisfaction
and exclaimed: "You up! What's the
matter?"

"You seemed willing that I should go on the
hunt," I stammered, fearful of a refusal at
the last moment.

"Seemed willing," my father repeated with
a slight smile.

Here my mother who was now up, broke in
quite excitedly: "You are surely not going
to be so crazy as to let Vanka go."

That saved me. Father always disliked any
interference, and now, in addition, mother's
tone angered him.

"Father," I begged, before he could speak,
"mother thinks I'm a baby. She doesn't understand
that I'm to be raised like a Cossack[63]
and not like a lamb. Uncle will take care of
me."

My father who was frowning deeply, seemed
to be turning over something in his mind. At
last, without looking at me, he said, "It'll do
you good. If your uncle will take charge of
you,       go."

I didn't give my mother a chance to utter a
word but flew out of the door like a bullet, forgetting
even to close the door after me, a negligence
usually punished in our village by a beating.

I did not lessen my speed until I found myself
at my uncle's felt-padded door. Turning
the knob (it was not customary to lock doors
or to knock in our village), I walked in.
Uncle was still in bed and at first could not understand
my presence. When he did, he
jumped to his feet with "You rascal, you
caught me this time, all right! Take any rifle
you want."

[64]

He pointed to several antlers on the wall on
which hung an array of rifles and daggers.
While I tried to decide on the rifle, he washed
and dressed, made a fire and began to prepare
pancakes and tea. Having decided what gun
I wanted, I helped him by hammering odd-shaped
lumps of sugar from a big cone-shaped
loaf.

From time to time he looked smilingly at
me and uttered unrelated ejaculations, from
which I learned that he favored my going.

We sat down, I thinking what a cheerful man
he was.

"I guess you haven't breakfasted," he said,
filling my plate. "Your mother probably gave
you a spanking instead of something to eat."

I looked up at him in surprise. How could
he know that I hadn't had anything to eat, and
that my mother was angry.

Having eaten heartily, we went out. I
helped saddle his horse, and then together,[65]
laughing and talking, we hitched a mule to a
sleigh into which we put hay and grain, a bag
of tobacco, some bread, salt and meat, sugar
and tea, an arkan (the Cossack's lassoo), and
some cartridges. I tried to follow his excellent
method of packing things away neatly, for I
knew that that was a part of the training of
every Cossack.

When we were ready to start, I in front, he
a few steps behind, his pipe in his mouth, a
smile on his lips, I could not help asking:
"Uncle, what are you smiling at?"

"At you!" he answered unexpectedly. "I
guess you wouldn't go home just now even for
ten rubles."[11]

"Why       " I began and stopped, wondering
again how he could read my thoughts. For it
had just occurred to me that if, for any reason,
I had to return, mother wouldn't let me out[66]
again, and perhaps even father        At this
point, I hit the mule on whose back I was
mounted, and we started off.

CHAPTER IX

THE HUNT


When we reached the meeting-place, more
than a dozen men on horseback were already
there. Close to them stood a big shallow
sleigh, the runners of which were a pair of
birch poles. In it were ropes, a hatchet, food
and forage. The driver of this was Daria, an
old woman, whom I have already mentioned
once or twice. I knew her story. The death
of her husband and two children of typhoid
fever had caused her to be despondent for several
years. Then some one left a foundling at
her door. She adopted the child, trying in
every way to make a worthy man of him. To
do this, she accepted all kinds of odd jobs, even
such as were generally given to men. She[68]
built fences, prepared the dead for burial, acted
as midwife and nurse, delivered messages that
nobody else cared to undertake, sometimes at
night or during severe storms. She seemed to
be afraid of nothing in the world and of nobody.

When she first began to work in this way,
she was pitied and helped; a little later, she
was laughed at, and unpleasant names were
applied to her; but finally, all came to have a
deep respect for her and to rely on her help
when trouble came.

Long years of humiliation and struggle for
a living, and the overcoming of all obstacles,
had made her somewhat imperative in manner.
She always expressed a decided opinion.
Many people thought she really knew everything,
and one or two superstitious persons
even insinuated that she was a witch. When
money or its equivalent in milk, eggs or flour
was offered for her services, she accepted it[69]
from those who could pay. From others she
refused everything, giving instead something
from her own small store.

I thought her very odd, but liked her.
Nevertheless, to-day,       well, to-day, it seemed
to me that it was not fitting that I, a Cossack,
should have to remain in the rear with a
woman.

Comforting myself with the knowledge that
Daria was a very unusual woman, I bade her
good morning.

"Good morning, you rascal," she answered.
"What are you doing here? I know that your
mother is worrying about you."

I did not think that this needed a reply.
Jumping down from the mule but holding on
to the reins, I joined a group of Cossacks who
formed a circle in front of their horses.

"I guess we're all here," remarked Mikhailov,
an active, talkative fellow who had lately
returned from actual service with the rank of[70]
non-commissioned officer and with the unpopular
habit of constantly assuming leadership.
He was probably the youngest present.

"Yes," replied my father. "And now we
must follow some system. Perhaps we'd better
cast lots to see who is to be our ataman, the
leader of our band."

Old Skorin shook his head. "What's the
use of that?" he said. "You know the country,
and you'll suit us."

This did not please Mikhailov, who tried to
put in an argument against there being any
leader, but he was overruled, one of the men
even turning to him with: "You, in particular,
need to be careful. Don't be too anxious
to shoot when you first catch sight of the tiger.
Wait until you can aim directly at his head or
heart. If you don't, he'll teach you something
that you'll never forget in this life."

"Keep your counsel for your own use," retorted
Mikhailov. "I don't need it."

[71]

Father here raised a warning hand and began
to assign to each one present his place and
duty.

"You, Simeon," he said, turning to one,
"take the hounds along the low places of the
valley, so as to get the tiger to move out of the
bushes into the open spaces in the hills. You,
Ivan and Feodor, take your places on the
western side of the brush and keep close
watch. Don't let the beast escape into the forest.
And you, Mikhailov, and you, Foma, remain
as quiet as dead men on the left side of
the brush, about one hundred feet apart.
Mind, you're to hide in the tall grass and not
show yourselves. The tiger will probably try
to run to Hog Valley. Don't miss him. Be
vigilant and brave."

Then he turned to me. "As for you,
Vanka, stay with Granny under the oak on yonder
hill. Tie the horses well and see that they
don't get frightened at either the tiger or the[72]
shots. See that you don't stare open-mouthed
at the sky and don't go where you're not
wanted. If you leave your place       you'll be
sorry that the tiger didn't get you. Do you
understand?"



ALEXIS PAVLOVITCH


Something in my father's voice cheered me.
I felt that he knew what he was about and that
I must obey.

Then Mikhailov asked father, "Where are
you going?"

"To the north of the valley, where I'll take
the rest and station them." Turning to Simeon
he added, "Don't let the hunt commence until
you hear a shot from my rifle." And, followed
by several men, he left us.

Before those remaining separated, I heard
Mikhailov remark to his neighbor, "Oh, he's
foxy. He's selected the best place for himself.
We'll not even catch a glimpse of the
tiger."

Here Daria turned quickly to him with,[73]
"You've returned from service as big a fool
as when you left. Do your duty and you'll find
that Alexis Pavlovitch has done you justice."
Striking her horses with a whip, Daria started
for the oak. I followed.

When I had tied the horses, I tried to wait
patiently for day-break. But oh, how long
the hours seemed! My fingers grew stiff with
the frost. I tried to limber them up by blowing
on them after I had taken off my mittens.
Here Daria jumped to the ground, picked up
a big handful of snow and rubbed her fingers
with it. After wiping them she put them into
the big sleeves of her fur coat, saying, "Now
even my old fingers are warm. Follow my example."

I bent down, my fingers so stiff that I could
hardly grab up any snow. As I rubbed them,
their flexibility gradually returned, and I dried
them on the border of my fur coat. Then,
still imitating my companion, I put them into my[74]
sleeves. They felt as warm as if they had just
come out of boiling water.

By the time the first glimmer of dawn appeared,
I could already distinguish Mikhailov,
who was lying half hidden in the dry grass, and
a moment after, the dogs leaping around
Simeon, who tried to keep them quiet while
waiting for my father's signal.

Just before sunrise, the faint sound of a shot
from down the valley came to us. Daria
awakened from her doze. At the same time
the hounds commenced to bark and move toward
the dry snow-covered brush covering the
bottom of the valley. At first Simeon held
them tightly by a rope and they barked regularly
and carelessly. Soon, however, there
was a change. Anger and hate mingled with
their bark.

"They have scented the tiger," whispered
Daria.

I forgot everything, horses, mule, myself,[75]
as I stared fearfully into the snow-covered underbrush
for a glimpse of the beast. At first
I could see nothing, for the white covering
grew blinding under the first rays of the sun.
That and the yellow leaves of the low Mongolian
oaks hid Simeon, the hounds, and
the tiger, making it seem a wall of mystery to
me.

I shivered for fear of the men as I recalled
how easily this tiger had carried off our cow.
It was not until later that I learned that even
the most ferocious of wild creatures will avoid
meeting man unless forced to do so.

The sun rose just behind where I was stationed,
and gradually I could see two stationary
black spots against the white of the hills opposite.
They were Ivan and Feodor.

On our side, Mikhailov and Foma showed
more excitement. They even kept bobbing into
sight, despite my father's strict orders to remain
hidden. I also made out two Cossacks,[76]
mere specks, down in the valley. But nowhere
could I find my father.

Suddenly I noticed a movement in the brush
some distance away. I thought it must be
Simeon and his hounds, until an open space was
reached and I distinctly saw an animal apparently
the size of a mouse. Unable to control
myself I cried: "The tiger!"

Daria's hand instantly covered my mouth.
But Mikhailov had heard and signaled
"Where?"

I tried to show him as best I could without
turning my eyes from the tiny spot on the
snow. It may have been that the tiger heard
my loud exclamation; it may have been that
something else attracted his attention; in any
case he remained motionless for a few seconds.
Then with one leap he disappeared again into
the brush.

Shortly after, Simeon and the two hounds
appeared in the same spot. Then my excitement[77]
cannot be described as I saw the tiger run
exactly toward where Mikhailov was concealed.
From my elevated position all this was visible;
Mikhailov, however, could not see how close
the tiger was to him.

In a very short time the beast had reached
the eastern side. He appeared so unexpectedly
before Mikhailov that the latter, instead of
shooting, uttered a curse, and the tiger turned
back. Here Mikhailov committed the grave
error against which he had been warned. He
shot in the direction that the tiger had gone and
evidently hit without killing him.

A terrible roar followed as the creature
turned and jumped right on the man who had
wounded him.



[78]




CHAPTER X

THE HUNT       CONTINUED


My heart gave a wild leap and I grabbed
hold of the side of the sled for support. Then
a great many things happened, but I recall them
to the smallest detail.

As the tiger's roar rang out, all the horses
tied to the trees and in my care broke their
halters and rushed wildly away. Daria's two
horses attached to the sled, followed, leaping
over all obstacles. Daria's greatest efforts
were powerless to even reduce their speed. I
soon forgot all about them, however, so intent
did I become on the picture before me.

I saw Foma, who was nearest, make a few
jumps toward him and then kneel and point
his rifle at the beast who clung to Mikhailov.[79]
A shot followed. Immediately after, the tiger
turned, looking just like a big cat. He gave
three or four convulsive shakes and fell back
without a sound on the snow, his hind legs sinking
deep into it, and his front legs stretched to
the sky.

I ran toward Mikhailov, but, before I
reached him, I felt a strong arm on my neck
and a voice interrupted by deep breathing:
"Stop, you crazy boy! Wait! He might be
able to break your neck yet. A tiger doesn't
die as quickly as that." I stopped, and with
the man who had spoken gazed where the tiger
lay. It remained motionless. After a few
seconds my companion judged it safe to approach.
Foma had shot him in the ear, killing
him instantly.

Mikhailov was lying with his right side and
part of his head deeply imbedded in the snow.
His fur coat had been torn from his shoulder,
revealing a deep wound from which the shoulder[80]
blade projected. At first sight his head
seemed attached to the body only by a shred of
skin, so unnaturally was it twisted to one side
and covered by a thick mass of blood.

Though shivering as if with a fever, I could
not turn my eyes from the terrible sight. I regained
possession of myself only when I heard
my father's voice as he came up on horseback.

As he jumped down to examine Mikhailov
he turned saying, "Go, help my brother catch
Daria's horses."

The man addressed leaped at once on father's
horse and hit it with a nagaika (a Cossack
whip). The spirited animal put back its
ears, and like an arrow shot out toward where
Daria's horses could be just seen running
around in circles in the snow.

One by one the other hunters arrived and
stood around Mikhailov. No one seemed to
know what to do, and no one dared, apparently,
say what he thought, although two of[81]
the men took off their hats as is generally done
in the presence of Death.

Finally some one did turn to my father with,
"Is he quite dead?"

As if in answer, Mikhailov just then made a
faint movement with a finger of his left hand.
It seemed to me that he was trying to signify
something by this, especially as it was followed
by a slight moan or two. Then again there
was silence.

Here some of the men began to talk, wondering
how he could have made so great a
blunder. My father stopped them. "It's
time to do something," he said, and beckoning
to two others to help him, tried to raise the
wounded man into a more comfortable position.
Mikhailov groaned faintly.

"Better let him die without hurting him,"
interjected my uncle, turning his head away.

"But look!" quickly exclaimed an intelligent-looking
young man. "His face isn't injured[82]
at all. Only his neck is torn. He
might live long enough to take the sacrament
at least, and even, perhaps, make his last will."

Four of the men again raised Mikhailov,
my father supporting his head, and placed him
on a saddle blanket that had been stretched out
on the snow.

Meanwhile Daria's horses had been caught
and she had driven up. As soon as sufficiently
near, she slipped down from her sleigh and
tottered toward the wounded man. Blood was
still dripping from the neck.

"Fools!" she exclaimed, looking indignantly
at the men. "It's lucky the blood has
partially clogged or he would have bled to
death before your eyes."

Then turning to one of the Cossacks she
added: "Your blouse looks clean. Give it to
me."

Without a word the man took it off and
handed it to her.

[83]

Paying no attention to the bits of advice that
now began to be given, such as "Put some tobacco
on the torn place," "Powder is the
best thing," she tore the shirt into pieces and
began to bandage the wound.

I watched her quick, sure movements with a
constantly growing admiration, my former
liking for her changing to a sort of reverent
love.

When she had finished and stretched herself
with difficulty, I found that the men had not
been idle. Dried twigs had been spread in the
sleigh and these covered with several horse-blankets,
the whole forming a comfortable bed.
The quickness with which it had been made
showed that the Cossacks were used to needing
it.

Several Cossacks now lifted the wounded
man on to the sleigh with as great care and
skill as that possessed by the best trained
nurses. They then helped Daria to an especially[84]
prepared place by his side. My uncle
took the driver's seat, and I, without waiting
for invitation or permission, jumped up next to
him. Slowly we drove off.

I looked back once or twice to see what those
left behind were doing. Some of them hung
the tiger to a strong tree, the skin having already
been loosened from his legs. Then they
carefully cut the thin under skin with their
hunting knives and gradually pulled it off from
the tail down.

As soon as we arrived at the village, a man
was sent on the swiftest horse to be found, to
the nearest stannica (an administrative Cossack
station) where a doctor was to be found.[12]

It was not until late at night that the doctor
arrived. When he had examined the
wound, he said: "I can't understand how he
has lasted so long with so little help."
[85]
"Will he live?" some one asked.

The doctor shook his head. "There's but
little chance of that," he said.

But I may as well say here that Mikhailov
did live, his wonderful constitution pulling him
through. His neck, however, was crippled, his
head always inclining toward the left side, and
his left arm practically disabled. The accident
taught him wisdom, and later he took to
hunting again, becoming the most renowned
hunter of wolves and bears in our district.

The tiger skin was sold to a passing merchant
for sixty rubles, while the tiger's heart
was bought by a Chinaman, who intended, it
was said, to reduce it to powder and sell it to
those who thought that they could thus have
some of the tiger's bravery transmitted to them.
The skull was given to Daria in acknowledgment
of her services, and kept by her, with
many other very curious things, in the front
room of her little log house.

[86]



CHAPTER XI

A JOURNEY


One day, not long after a traveling merchant
had brought us news of Dimitri, my father
called me to the bench on which he sat,
and putting his hands on my head, asked:
"How would you like to learn to read and
write?"

At first I did not know what to answer, the
question was so unexpected. Glancing at my
mother, I saw that it made her so uneasy that
she dropped a tumbler on the floor, a very unusual
happening.

Although father did not insist on my answering,
the question kept coming back to me all
that day and the next, until I decided that to
learn to read and write would be a very good
thing.

[87]

For some days following this question, I noticed
that father seemed to be brooding over
something, and finally, to my great surprise, I
accidentally learned that I was the cause of his
worry.

One night after I had gone to my bed, where
I lay dreaming of having won distinction in
the army, I heard mother say, "What's worrying
you, Alexis? Are you sick? Or is anything
wrong with the horses? Or"       here
her voice trembled       "have you had bad tidings
of Dimitri that you're afraid to tell
me?"

"Oh, no," father answered. "Nothing is
wrong." Then he abruptly changed the conversation.
"Do you remember Mongalov?"

"Do you mean your chum, Vanka, whom
my mother spanked when he threw mud at me
as a child?"

"That's the one," replied my father.[88]
"But you mustn't call him Vanka any more.
Didn't Mitya tell you that he is now a sotnik?"[13]

"What! An officer! Is it possible?"

"Yes,       and I am not," said my father
with a certain bitterness in his voice. "Yet I
had a better chance in some ways than he."
Here his voice sank lower. "Now, our Vanka
isn't stupid, and if we give him an education I
don't see why he shouldn't become an officer.
Too bad that that fellow Gabrilov, whom we
had here as a teacher last spring, turned out to
be such a drunkard. We really had to get rid
of him."

Mother interrupted him. "Judging by
Gabrilov, education isn't such a splendid thing.
Boys brought up in town learn all sorts of
wicked things. I'd rather keep Vanka here.
He can learn to be as good a Cossack in our
village as anywhere else. Mongalov may
[89]dress better than you, but he isn't respected a
bit more. After Katia is married I don't see
how I can get along without Vanka."

Here I fell asleep with the pleasant knowledge
that, after all, I was not simply a nuisance
but meant something to my parents.

The next morning father went about his
work as usual, feeding the horses and cattle,
and bringing wood and cutting it. In the
meantime mother brought water from the well
in the middle of the yard, and I pumped water
into a big trough to which I led the horses.

When this had been done, father caught two
of the horses, gave them some grain and tied
them to a post.

Seeing my look of inquiry, he smilingly repeated
a favorite proverb, "Don't try to learn
too much or your hair will turn gray."

As we went in to breakfast his lips moved as
if he were talking to himself, a habit he had
formed whenever he had a great deal on his[90]
mind. Mother watched him with a troubled
air, and at last asked: "What's the matter,
Alexis?"

Without replying to her question, he said,
"I have to go to Habarovsk to-day, and I'll
take Vanyuska with me. I've been promising
him the ride for a long time."

I jumped up, waved my arms, and with my
mouth full of bread, shouted: "Hurrah!"

My mother stopped me. "Sit down, you
foolish boy. You can't go. I need you."

But, after a long argument, mother agreed
to my going. Then father and I cleaned the
horses and tied their tails up as high as possible,
for at this time of the year the roads were very
muddy. I placed a light saddle on the horse I
was to ride, and father's military saddle with
its high trees on the other horse. As father
put some sacks with forage behind these, Katia
came out with something that mother was sending
Dimitri. I was very glad to see this, for[91]
it meant that we were going to visit the Cossack
barracks.

Half an hour later we had left home and
were making our way through the deep mud.
It was a beautiful Spring morning. The air
was fresh and clear, and, despite the heavy road,
the horses were full of spirit and went on with
a light and springy gait.

At a turn of the road I suddenly saw two rabbits
sitting about a hundred feet from us.
Pointing to them, I called to my father to look.
Here my horse jumped to one side and I was
all but thrown from the saddle.

My father was quite angry. He turned to
me exclaiming roughly: "What's the matter
with you? A Cossack should always watch his
horse. He must never be taken by surprise
even should the horse leap a fence. You almost
fell like a sack."

Since that lesson I have never failed in watchfulness,
never "fallen asleep," as the Cossacks[92]
say, even when trying to ride a mule or an ox.

We did not meet many travelers. Once a
company of dusky, flat-featured natives of the
Lake Baikal region, passed us, splendidly
mounted on their horses. Their large, squat
bodies gave them a somewhat forbidding air,
but I knew how peaceful and harmless they
really are. The Russians call them Bratskie
(brotherly people). One was dressed in a
long, purplish blue cloak, lined with fur, and
had on a curious blue cone-shaped hat. The
others were evidently Cossacks, for they had
on the distinguishing uniform. They may have
been on their way to some Buddhist shrine, for
the Russian Government, severe with its own
people, allows those born into other religions to
worship as they please. "God gave us our
religion. He gave them theirs," expresses the
attitude taken.

It was just here that we were overtaken by a
man mounted like ourselves on a shaggy Siberian[93]
pony. When he had come up, both he
and my father gave expression to surprised
greetings. He proved to be an old-time acquaintance.
There was no end of questions
and answers for he rode with us as far as our
destination. He had just come from the city
of Vladivostok,[14] the great growing seaport of
Siberia. As he gave a glowing description of
the place, I was reminded of the meaning of
the name Vladi-vostok       possessor of the
East.

"We may build a great trade with the
United States through Vladivostok," he remarked
among other things. "It has a splendid,
land-locked harbor, large enough for any
number of vessels,       and a beautiful one as
well."

"But isn't it frozen a large part of the
year?" my father asked.
[94]
"From the latter part of December to April.
It's really too bad so great a country as ours
hasn't an outlet further south. But all trade
isn't stopped on account of the ice. There is
a channel kept open for the largest ships all
winter by means of ice-breakers."

"What kind of people are there in Vladivostok?"
I ventured to ask, half fearful of
saying something ridiculous.

The man turned to me with a smile.
"Many exactly like those in your village.
Then people from different parts of Europe,
and Chinese and Japanese. Also quite a number
of Koreans, whom you can tell by their
white dress. You'll see those in Habarovsk,
also." After a moment's pause, he went on,
"The bay is called the Golden Horn (Zolotoy
Rog). The town rises up from it in terraces.
It is very picturesque."

"I suppose there is a fort there," I again
ventured.

[95]

This time the man laughed. "If you visited
this seaport you might think it all forts. There
are defenses,       forts and guns,       whole lines
of them, everywhere. The greater part of the
population consists of soldiers and sailors."

Here my father broached the subject of
which his mind seemed so full these days. "I
suppose there are fine schools," he said.

I was so stiff by this time, and my back ached
so much from the long unusual ride, that I was
no longer able to concentrate my mind on anything
except that I must not disgrace my father
and myself by showing fatigue.

At last we approached the great Amur River.
Across it we could just make out a few black
spots and the shining roof of a church.

After a half hour ride we came to a place on
the bank where a raft was stationed. A few
people were already aboard, desiring, like ourselves,
to be taken across. Two soldiers had
the boat in charge, and as soon as we were on,[96]
every one helped them in making the somewhat
difficult trip.

On the opposite bank we parted from our
companion, and then, for the first time, I fully
realized that we had reached our destination,       the
important garrison town of Habarovsk.

CHAPTER XII

A GARRISON TOWN


This was my first visit to a city, and I gazed
with very wide wonder at the wooden sidewalks,
the big stores, the many two-story houses, the
well-dressed women and the numerous soldiers
on the street. I could hardly understand what
father said to me, so absorbed was I in the
entirely new scenes before me.

Suddenly we heard the sound of trumpets,
cymbals, and tambourines, accompanied by a
lively song. Then a company of Cossacks on
horseback issued from a side street. At the
head of the column rode a group of special
singers,       pesenniki.

Father and I stationed ourselves near the
edge of the street, and tried to find a familiar
figure. The long row of faces splashed here[98]
and there with mud; the similar uniforms, with
rifles protruding from leather straps at the back
and swords at the side; the hats tipped to the
right, all exactly at the same angle; every left
hand holding the bridle reins, every right hand
placed on the hips;       how was it possible to
distinguish among them?

I soon decided that my only chance of finding
Dimitri was to look for his horse, which I knew
to be gray, while the majority were bay. It
was not long before I shouted: "Father, look
at the eighth row! Dimitri!" Then still
louder: "Dimitri! Dimitri! Look! Here
we are!"

Brother turned and nodded, but, to my great
astonishment, did not come to us, but followed
the others without giving any other expression
of recognition.

Then I heard father saying, "Why can't you
be quiet? Dimitri can't come to us until his
company is dismissed."

[99]

Meanwhile the Cossacks, six abreast, continued
to ride past us whistling and singing.

The entire population of the place now
seemed to gather on the sidewalk. There were
merchants in front of their stores, boys who
tried hard to keep step with the horses, women
returning from market with baskets on their
arms, all gazing with appreciation at what was
a daily sight. How very desirable it seemed to
me to be one of such a company. How glad I
was that my brother belonged to it, and that
my father was a Cossack. Hoping to impress
a pretty little girl who stood near me, I took
off my felt cap with its yellow cloth top, symbolic
of the East Siberian Cossacks, and then
having looked at it, slowly put it on again.

The Cossack officers rode on one side of the
men. They were distinguished not only by
their brighter uniforms but also by the half
Arabian horses on which they were mounted.
Many of them had silver-plated belts around[100]
their waists. They had no rifles, only swords
that shone brightly, while revolvers hung from
their left sides. The bridles of their horses
glimmered with silver. All the horses were
covered with foam, showing that the drill had
been no easy one.

When we reached the barracks, the commanding
officer gave an order, and the whole
company leaped like one man from their horses
to the ground. Another order, and the horses
were led to the stables, adobe buildings covered
with thatched roofs.

After the horses were rubbed down and fed,
Dimitri at last came and embraced us, saying:
"Wait for me at the rooms of the second
platoon, where I'll join you as soon as I am
free."

Then he ran with others to wash before
taking his place in the dining-room. As we
made our way to the dormitory, my attention
was again attracted by singing, but of a different[101]
kind. It was the solemn prayer which was
always chanted before dinner.

Soon we found ourselves in a long room in
a brick building. Everything about it was
exceedingly neat. High windows admitted
plenty of light, and as all were open there was
a fine circulation of fresh air. The walls were
apparently freshly white-washed, the floors
painted. In one corner hung a big ikon with a
lamp under it. About fifty iron beds placed in
two rows were down the middle. Each bed
was covered with a gray blanket and each was
marked with the name of the owner. Along
the inside of the wall stood racks for the rifles.

When, after a half hour, we heard the chanting
of the prayer of thanks in the dining-room
near by, we looked expectantly at the door.
The company soon filed in. Some stretched
themselves on their beds, some sat down to
read, and some began to mend their clothes.

When Dimitri came, one of father's first inquiries[102]
was regarding schools and the promotion
to officer rank. My brother was not well
posted and so called the sergeant-major to help
him. Time passed quickly until the hour for
drill. Then the first Cossack who noticed that
an officer had entered the room, exclaimed,
"Silence! Rise!"

At once there was deep quiet as all arose. I
was amazed at the sudden change, and looked
with respect and fear at the man who could
produce it. It was father's old-time friend,
Captain Mongalov. I watched everything that
he did with great intentness, noted how his
worn-out uniform was tightly buttoned, how
erect he held his body. Even the curves of his
legs, probably caused from living so much on
horseback, and the way he swayed from side to
side as he walked, attracted me. And how
splendid and fierce I thought his big black
mustache reaching almost to his ears.

His face was a peculiar mixture of the Russian[103]
and Asiatic types, occasionally met among
Siberian Cossacks. When he smiled, he
showed two rows of perfect ivory, and he
smiled often. Yet even with his comrades his
expression could change to one of great sternness
at the least break of discipline.

When he saw us he turned to my father with,
"From where do you hail, friend?"

Father slowly and smilingly replied, "Don't
you recognize me, Ivan Petrovitch? I have
just come from the Ussuri."

"What! Is it you, Alexis Pavlovitch!"
Mongalov exclaimed. "It's ages since I last
saw you." And he embraced my father.

After a short exchange of reminiscences, he
turned to me. "Is this your son? He
promises to make a fine Cossack! Are you
keeping in mind, my son, Cossack ideals of bravery
and honor?"

Drawing myself to my full height in imitation
of the bearing of those around me, I[104]
answered as well as I could, looking straight
into his eyes as I did so.

"Good!" he exclaimed, and taking hold of
me under the elbows he tossed me, like an old
acquaintance, high into the air.

Then, suddenly, he turned to my father.
"You must excuse me now. I want to see
more of you some evening at my house." And,
in a flash, the genial friend had changed into
the stern commander of a company who, at a
single word from him, proceeded to do the various
tasks necessary before retiring.



[105]




CHAPTER XIII

A COSSACK DRILL


The night was spent at the home of an aunt,
whose husband, a grocer, was also a retired
Cossack. Their home was a very humble one,
but what it lacked in luxury it made up in the
hospitality of its owners.

Fresh straw for beds was brought in and
put in a room set apart. This straw was covered
with heavy home-spun bed linen, some
feather pillows, and two big fur coats as comforters.
After a fire had been kindled in the
stove, we were invited to partake of supper,
which consisted of deer meat, pancakes heavily
buttered, and sour cream.

After eating very heartily I became so sleepy
that I was ordered to bed. When I awoke,
the sun was streaming directly into my face.[106]
Father, who was already dressed, tried to hurry
me by saying, "You are a nice Cossack! They
must be half through the drill which you were
so anxious to see. Mongalov has promised to
give you a horse so that you can follow the
sotnia" (a company of from one hundred and
twenty to one hundred and sixty horsemen).

This was news to me. Burning my mouth
in my haste to swallow my hot tea, I was ready
to follow my father in a few minutes.

When we came to the barracks the Cossacks,
holding on to the reins of their horses with their
right hands, were assembled in the front yard,
and the sergeant-major was calling the roll.
"We came too late for the morning prayer,"
my father whispered to me as the roll was
ended.

Here came an order from the sergeant-major.
"Seat yourselves." At once every
man leaped upon his horse.

"Line up," came next, and the horses arranged[107]
themselves in two straight lines, head to
head and breast to breast.

"Silence!" was the next order, and all gazed
mutely ahead, immovable as statues.

Some long command, the words of which I
did not catch, followed, and the company
changed positions to six in a row. A moment
after, all were trotting along the road out of
town.

As we started to follow, the sergeant-major
hailed me. "Good morning! Are you the
young fellow whom Captain Mongalov wishes
to have a horse?"

"Yes," answered my father for me, adding,
"But I'm afraid he isn't a good enough rider
to follow the company."

"Never fear," returned the sergeant-major.
"I'll bet he's a true Cossack and will take to
horses as a duck does to a lake."

A soldier now held a horse until I had
climbed into its saddle. When he let it go, it[108]
started so fast to catch up with the others that
I had difficulty in keeping my seat. However
I did this, and also managed to prevent the
horse from joining the ranks.

After we had left the city, the company was
halted in a big plain which stretched far out
before us. It was somewhat rolling, with here
and there washed-out places. The sergeant-major
rode along the line inspecting the ammunition
and appearance of the men. While
he was doing this, horses were heard approaching
at full speed. On the foremost sat Mongalov.
A little behind came two other officers.

"Greetings to you, little brothers!" he
shouted as he rode along the line without reining
in his horse.

Then I was almost dumbfounded by the suddenness
of a gigantic answer. "Good Day to
Your Honor," came from the company as from
one man.

Mongalov noticed me and kindly stopped to[109]
say: "Keep close to the trumpeter and you'll
see everything. Only don't get into anybody's
way or I'll have to arrest you." With a smiling
nod he rode to the front.

At a word from him, the officers took their
places. Then followed several changes of
position, all done with great rapidity and
precision. I learned later that Captain Mongalov's
men were unusually well trained even
for Cossacks. The Captain loved his profession
and the men were devoted to him. There
was something fatherly in the great care that
he took of the Cossacks under him. On the
other hand, he was severe in punishing any
breach of discipline. No one resented this
since he was just and endeavored to make the
punishment corrective.

At the conclusion of the drill Mongalov
called out in a voice resounding with warm
approval: "Well done, little brothers, well
done. Thank you!"

[110]

And again, as one man, the company responded:
"We were glad to do our best,
Your Honor."

"Down!" was the next order.

All leaped together to the ground.

"Rest and smoke," came again, and he and
his officers jumped off their own horses and
stood together discussing the next drill.

The company followed their example, and
soon burst into loud talk and laughter, while
clouds of smoke arose from pipes and cigarettes.

In the meantime I didn't know what to do.
I was afraid that if I climbed down I couldn't
get up again on my horse, who seemed unusually
lively and disobedient to me. But I
was not left long in this awkward position, for
after a quarter of an hour of rest the Cossacks
were again on their horses, every man ready to
obey any order.

To judge by the alert look on their faces,[111]
the most important part of the drill was now to
come. Every eye was turned toward their
commanding officer as if trying to guess what
new trick would be required of them.

Mongalov sat on his steed, his right hand
twirling his mustache, his eyes directed far down
the field as if surveying the distance or estimating
the difficulties before his men. Then his
voice rang out abruptly: "Company, build
lava!"

These words produced an effect like a discharge
of ammunition in the midst of the Cossacks.
The horses rushed madly forward and
to each side of the center, forming a kind of
fan. Only by putting forth the full strength
of my arm did I keep my horse in place, the
proud animal trying so hard to show that she
understood the command.

In the wink of an eye the compact body of
horses was transformed into a long line of separate
riders, stretched so that there was about[112]
twenty feet between each. All were still, the
men with swords drawn out of their scabbards.

Mongalov no longer shouted orders but indicated
what was to be done by waving his sword
in different directions. As if charmed by its
motions, the long line moved, now to the right,
now to the left, now forward, now backward.

Once Mongalov, evidently dissatisfied, ordered
the trumpeter to repeat through the
trumpet the order given with the sword. Since
that time I have loved the harmonious sounds
of the Cossack trumpet which in a very short
time I grew to understand as plainly as spoken
words.

Here something happened. Mongalov
again made a sign to the trumpeter. A short,
disagreeably false tone was the result. At this
the Cossacks acted like mad. With swords outstretched,
they bent down to their horses' manes
and with a terrible yell, "Whee-ee!" they
rushed wildly to the front against an imaginary[113]
enemy. My horse with ears back, took her
bit between her teeth, and flew after them.
Here I learned how rapidly a horse can travel.
The air whistled in my ears; my hat was blown
off; my feet flew from the stirrups; and not to
be thrown off, I grabbed the horse by the mane,
uttering a short prayer.

I did not know what was happening around
me until I found myself, perhaps because of
my light weight, among the other Cossacks.
Around me were excited faces with wild expressions;
faces that had lost their humanity; faces
such as demons might possess, or Christian
fanatics who would lay down their lives for
their faith.

As we rode, a big washout suddenly loomed
before us. Most of the horses immediately
jumped over and disappeared in a mad rush
forward. But my horse and those of three
men, perhaps through some fault on our part,
did not make the proper jump. I felt a shock[114]
as the hoofs of my horse struck the opposite
banks of the ravine, and then the horse fell to
the ground, throwing me over its head into the
middle of a mud-hole.

As I struggled to get up, there came a new
signal of three long harmonious sounds. The
lava was stopped. Once out of the hole, I saw
a line of still excited horses far to the front.
Two or three riderless horses, one of them
mine, were running around them. Not far
from me lay another breathing hard and trying
vainly to rise. Near it a Cossack lay stretched
out, while two others sat on the ground a short
distance away.

In a short time Mongalov, the trumpeter,
and two officers, came galloping to us. His
first question was to me. "Are you hurt?"

"No," I replied, in a voice that sounded
strange to me, so shaken was I with the new
experience.

"Here," said Mongalov to a Cossack,[115]
"place this boy back of yourself." Then,
throwing the reins of his horse to the trumpeter,
he leaped down and turned his attention to the
man lying stretched on the ground.

He proved to be alive but with a leg broken
and was put into the ambulance which had come
up. "What's the matter with you?" Mongalov
asked the two bruised, scratched, and mud-covered
men who sat on the ground.

"Nichevo,"[15] they answered, smiling and
shaking their heads. And as soon as their
horses were caught and brought to them, they
managed to leap on them as if in reality nothing
had happened.

When my horse was led up, Mongalov
looked at me where I sat ashamed to meet his
gaze, holding tightly to the belt of the man
before me. "You can stay where you are, my
boy," he said kindly, "or ride your own horse.
But let me congratulate you on being now a true[116]
Cossack. The man who has never fallen from
his saddle can never make a satisfactory cavalryman!"

How much good these words did me! They
not only made me feel at ease with myself, but
taught me one of the best lessons of my life:
that mistakes or mishaps do not down a man
who can rise above them. With some difficulty
I slipped from my safe position, and climbed
as swiftly as possible into the saddle of my
former horse.

It was not long before the entire company
were again on their way back to town. At the
call "Singers forward," several Cossacks left
the ranks and took their places at the head of
the column. One of these men was urged to
sing and he responded with a Little Russian
song about a Cossack who returned home from
fighting the Turks. At the conclusion of each
stanza those surrounding the soloist began the
refrain which was taken up by the entire company.[117]
Listening to this story-telling song I
almost forgot that I was in Siberia, so vividly
did pictures of what took place far away a hundred
years ago pass before me.

This song was followed by a boisterous rollicking
one. The chorus was loud and accompanied
by cymbals and tambourine. Any one
glancing at the broadly smiling and yelling
faces, would not have believed that their owners
were just returning from the most strenuous
kind of work, had it not been for the mud and
perspiration visible and their foam-covered
horses.

[15] Nothing; no harm.



[118]



CHAPTER XIV

AN EVENING VISIT


As we approached the town, there was less
talking and laughing and the singing became
less boisterous. The crowds gathered as I had
seen them before, and showed their appreciation
of the songs by now and then joining in the
chorus.



COSSACK OFFICERS


Before the barracks were reached, the men
leaped down from the horses, loosened their
saddle girths, and led them to the stables.
Here they unsaddled them, gave them hay, and
curried them, while the non-commissioned officers
inspected their legs as well as the skin that
had been under the saddles. This was done
with much caution, for Captain Mongalov was
particularly strict regarding the health and
[119]care of the horses. Where there was negligence,
his usual reprimand was apt to end with:
"Don't forget next time that the Cossack
army's efficiency depends more on the sound
legs of a good horse than on the blockhead who
does not know enough to take care of them."

When all the horses had been inspected,
cleaned, watered, and given their prescribed
measure of oats, the men were allowed to go to
get themselves ready for dinner, leaving, however,
four men whose turn it was to take care
of the stables.

I wish there were time to tell of all the wonders
of that garrison visit, of the dinner in the
big dining-room with Dimitri, of the lessons
given the young men, of the instructing officers,
and most of all of my first sight of the fascinating
and difficult exercise called the jigatovka,
which I saw that same afternoon, and which
consisted of horse vaulting, dart throwing at a
gallop and many other things.

[120]

Captain Mongalov invited us all to spend the
evening at his house, and by six o'clock my
father, my aunt, and I were at his front door.
Being a little in advance of the others, I tried
to open it, but, to my surprise, found it was not
possible to do so. Could it be locked, I wondered.
In our village such a thing was never
done except under very unusual circumstances.
Father, noting my surprise, pointed to a handle
on the door which he bade me pull down. I did
so and heard a loud ring within. In a moment
the door was opened by an orderly, who greeted
us like friends and invited us in.

When he had gone to announce us, I glanced
around the room. A big desk occupied the left
corner, the top of which was covered with
books relating to military regulations. The
big brass inkstand with its two kinds of ink,
black and red, especially attracted me. On a
table near by, a heavy nickel-plated lamp threw
its light over a mass of official papers. Instead[121]
of benches around the room as at my
own home there were numerous comfortable
chairs.

One wall was covered with the skins of wild
beasts. I recognized those of a black and
of a brown bear. Above these were fastened
enormous antlers. On their very numerous
branches hung swords, daggers, and other arms.
Pictures, one of which was that of an old lady
plainly dressed (the Captain's mother), hung
on the opposite wall.

Then my attention fastened itself on a big
tiger skin covering a sofa. I touched the artificial
eyes which looked so intently at me; I
wondered if the teeth were real. So occupied
did I become that it was like an electric shock
to feel a sudden clap on my shoulder and the
Captain's hearty voice greeting me.

I immediately experienced a strong desire to
converse with him as I would with an older
brother, but he had turned from me and was[122]
busy answering some of my father's numerous
questions.

The bell rang again and admitted a new
group. My aunt at once stepped up and threw
her arms about one of the women in it, who
proved to be her own cousin from the pretty
neighboring city of Blagovestchensk. Closely
following the cousin came her husband, a former
artillery officer, with a very long beard.
His thick, bushy gray hair framed a small sympathetic
face. With them was a pale but very
attractive lady dressed in a gray suit. A little
girl of about my own age, had hold of her
hand.

Mongalov greeted this lady with particular
respect and gallantly kissed her hand. Then
he invited all to take off their wraps and make
themselves at home, that is, all but Nina, the
little girl, and myself. He had beckoned to
us to follow the orderly into the garden.

Here we found many things to interest us.[123]
There was a horse that refused sugar from
Nina but accepted, to my great delight, bread
and salt from me. There were fancy chickens,
and, best of all, a sort of see-saw on which I
condescended to accept Nina's invitation to
play. We stood as straight as possible on the
board which was balanced on a log, and as it
went up and down jumped alternately into the
air, each time going a little higher. Nina was
not at all afraid, and despite a peculiar seriousness
about her, we were well acquainted when
supper was announced.

The table, set with more good things than I
had ever seen before, was in a long dining-room.
Soon everybody was laughing and joking,
everybody except Nina's mother. It
seemed to me that she was not like the rest of
us but I could not have told why.

The supper lasted a long time and when we
returned to the big living-room, the piano,
which stood on one side, was opened and Lidia[124]
Ivanovna, the lady in gray, consented to play
some Russian airs from Glinka's opera, "Life
of the Tzar."

Shortly after, both she and her little daughter
as well as my aunt's cousin left, pleading
the weariness still felt by the strangers from
long travel.

When they had gone, Mongalov turned to
the former artillery officer, whose name was
Kuzmin, and asked, "Where did you meet
Lidia Ivanovna?"

"She came with a caravan of prisoners sent
from St. Petersburg." (Petrograd.) "I am
told that she is looking for her husband who
was sent to Siberia a few years ago as a political
exile.[16] If she can find him, she wishes to share
his fate."

Here I exclaimed impulsively: "It ought
to be easy to find him. The government officials
can surely tell her where he is."
[125]
Kuzmin smiled bitterly. "They can, perhaps,
if they wish. You must remember, however,
that Siberia is no little state. When I
came here, it was with many thousands of prisoners,
mostly Poles who had fought for their
country's independence, and they are now so
scattered that you might not meet a dozen in a
lifetime."

"How big is Siberia?" I asked.

"In figures, it is more than five million
square miles, but see that map hanging on the
wall," said the old man with some eagerness, as
if glad of the change in the conversation, "and
see that little dot. That stands for the biggest
city you know, the one you are now in, Habarovsk."

"That little dot!" I exclaimed in surprise,
for no one had ever explained a map to me before.

"This waving line," continued Kuzmin, "is
the Amur River."

[126]

Again I stared incredulously. How could
a little line stand for the very wide Amur whose
waters ran from horizon to horizon!

"Now that is only a small part of Siberia,"
said my new teacher. "From here at
Habarovsk to the Ural Mountains, which separate
Siberia from Russia, it takes two months
to travel both day and night in a carriage."

"Tell me some other things about Siberia," I
begged.

He pointed to a blue spot in the south.
"This is Lake Baikal,[17] the largest body of fresh
water in Asia, about four hundred miles long
and about forty-five miles wide. It is fifteen[127]
hundred feet above the level of the sea. It is
a place full of mystery. I don't know if any
one yet has been able to find how deep it is.
On one side are all kinds of caverns and arches.
It's pretty but it's mysterious. Now and then
the earth in the vicinity trembles and quakes.
Irkutsk, the largest and most important city in
Siberia, is not very far from it."

After a moment's pause, he went on: "Let
me tell you something of Blagovestchensk,[18] my
own city. But no; I'd talk too long. Why
don't you move there?" turning suddenly to
my father.

My father shook his head. "If I move,"
he said slowly, "I want to try farming."

"Farming offers many inducements," agreed
Kuzmin. "I meet many farmers who came
here penniless and now have hundreds of acres[128]
of land and hundreds of head of cattle and
stables filled with grain."[19]

"Were you ever in St. Petersburg?" I asked
unexpectedly. At this question a queer change
came over Kuzmin's face and he looked down
without answering.

Here Mongalov reached for his balalaika, a
sort of Russian mandolin, and began to play
some gay Russian airs on it.

When we reached home, I asked my father
why Kuzmin did not wish to talk about St.
Petersburg.

"He is a useful and clever man," my father
answered, "but, poor fellow, he belongs to the
unfortunates."

From that I understood that, like Lidia
Ivanovna's husband, the former artillery officer
was an exile.

to be the deepest lake in the world. There are many very
interesting things about this lake. For one thing, everything
points to its being very ancient. Water flowing into
it is supposed to be ten times that flowing out into the Angara
River. What becomes of it? Its waters are fresh, yet gulls,
cormorants, and other birds usually found only on the sea,
haunt it, and seals actually live in it. The peasants call it
the Holy Sea and have many superstitions regarding it.       The
Editor.



[18] Blagovestchensk is now one of the prettiest cities in
Siberia. It has tree-lined avenues, parks, and attractive
residences. There are also fine schools, public libraries,
theaters, and hospitals free to the poor.       The Editor.



[19] Between 1905 and 1914 more than 3,000,000 colonists

Government to help the new settlers in their new life.       The

CHAPTER XV

LENT AND EASTER


Next morning my father took me to an exhibition
held to show something of the resources
of Siberia. While I studied the many
evidences of great mineral wealth,[20] my father
devoted his attention to everything that pertained
to farming.

On the way back to my aunt's I learned that
we were not to go home yet, father having decided
to stay for the week of repentance, a
religious custom observed by orthodox Russians.

"You are now old enough to take your first
sacrament after confession," he said to me.

[130]

When I went next to the big church, with its
onion-shaped dome, I felt quite nervous thinking
of all the faults and sins that I would have
to confess for the first time in my life.

The service was a very solemn one. Every
once in a while one of the black-robed priests
came out from behind the sacred gates on the
altar and read the prayer:


"Lord and Protector of my life,
Keep me from idleness,
Keep me from disappointment,
Keep me from false ambition,
Keep me from idle chattering.
Give me chastity,
Give me humility and love,
Me, Thy servant.
O Heavenly Czar, open my eyes to my sins;
Let me not judge my neighbors,
Let me reverence Thee always."


Not until the end of the service did the choir
sing something very sweet in a minor key.

Child though I was, I left the church with a
sense of the vanity of earthly things. I was[131]
ready to repent. I particularly remembered a
day when I had taken a stick and hit my dog,
poor dear Manjur. This, I told myself, I must
confess, and also how often I had teased my
baby sister.

On the night of confession, when, after a very
long wait, my turn came, I found myself before
a priest whose long beard made his face
remind me of pictures of prophets that I had
seen. It was very late, and he looked tired,
but his eyes shone with sympathy as he listened
to my brief recital.

I was so overcome with weariness[21] when I
reached home that I threw myself, supperless
and partly dressed, on my bed and at once fell
asleep.

I awoke very hungry next morning and after
washing, hurried to the table where breakfast
usually awaited me. The table was empty and[132]
all the people in the room were dressed in their
Sunday clothes.

"Get ready quickly," said my father, "to
come with us to church."

"But can't I have some bread and tea first?"
I asked.

"No, indeed," said my father sternly.
"You must not drink even a drop of water
between confession and the taking of the sacrament."

"A drop of water!" I repeated in confusion.
For it had happened that I had swallowed a
drop when washing that morning. This troubled
me until later the priest assured me that
that did not count, since it had been involuntary.

I went to church with my stomach groaning
for food. This, and the incense-laden air,
caused me to feel faint until at last with many
others, I received my share of the consecrated
bread and wine.

[133]

This somewhat revived me, and I looked
around with more interest at the people near
by. There were several persons of note in the
church, some in government uniforms with
numerous medals on their breasts. Mongalov
and his Cossack officers were among these,
dressed in entirely new uniforms, but without
fire-arms or ammunition, even their swords being
detached and kept for them by outsiders
until they had partaken of the sacrament.

When we came back to my aunt's I found
many preparations already made for the Easter
festival. The big dining-table had been
much enlarged. It was covered with a white
cloth and decorated with flowers and greens.
On it were all kinds of attractive food. I was
most impressed by what the Russians call
pashka. It was in the shape of a pyramid and
had been made by my aunt from cottage cheese,
mixed with cream, sugar, and raisins. On it
were figures of the Cross.

[134]

On each side of the pashka, which occupied
the center of the table, was an entire ham
baked in dough, several dozen eggs covered
with various bright designs, and many other
things.

To my great disappointment, nobody was allowed
to touch even a bit of bread. Everything
had to wait for Easter morn.

I was told that I should be awakened that
night, and I was by the solemn ringing of
the heaviest bells in the neighborhood. We
dressed hastily and hurried to the church for
the midnight service. There were so many already
there that we had difficulty in entering.

Everybody looked happy, even the priests
who were all dressed in white, silvery robes.
When the service was over there was much
kissing, every one repeating, "Christ is risen,"
or the response, "He is risen indeed."

It was almost four o'clock before we returned
home with two or three guests who had[135]
been invited to break the fast with us. Before
any other food was served, small pieces of consecrated
pashka and an Easter cake called
kulich were passed around.

The next day was spent by the men in paying
calls to all whom they knew. As they had
to eat and drink at every house, the result can
be imagined.

The Easter celebration lasted a full week.
What I liked best about it was the merry rolling
of eggs down hill, the swings, enormous
slides and see-saws, and other amusements provided
for the children.

At last the joyous time came to an end, and
after a last breakfast with Dimitri in the dining-room
of the Second Platoon, father and
I mounted our horses for home.

It seemed very long to me since I had come
away. I thought several times of Peter and
wondered if I could not show him some of the
tricks of the jigatovka. When we neared our[136]
village, I sat very proud and erect with my mind
quite made up that mother would surely mistake
me for Dimitri. But as we rode into our
yard, instead of anything like that happening,
mother came running out and throwing her
arms about me exclaimed: "O Vanyuska,[22]
you must be tired out from your long ride.
Come in quickly and tell me how you ever managed
for so long without your mother?"

Cloth decorative, with special designs and illustrations                                      $1.25


In choosing her title, Mrs. Johnston had in mind
"The Road of the Loving Heart," that famous highway,
built by the natives of Hawaii, from their settlement
to the home of Robert Louis Stevenson, as a
memorial of their love and respect for the man who
lived and labored among them, and whose example of
a loving heart has never been forgotten. This story of
a little princess and her faithful pet bear, who finally
do discover "The Road of the Loving Heart," is a masterpiece
of sympathy and understanding and beautiful
thought.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
