5NOTICE.
Adelung said to me one day at Petersburg              Have you
read Peter 
Schlemihl?                     No.                     If you 
read it, you will translate it.              I have translated 
it.
The story is a moral one.       I leave its development to my 
readers.       It would be little flattering to them to suspect 
they required my assistance, in order to discover the obvious 
lessons it conveys.
I have not scrupled to introduce a few verbal alterations; but
the deviations from the original are very trifling.
The 
Translator.
p. 
7To my Friend Wangner
Come to the land of shadows for awhile,
And seek for truth and wisdom!       Here below,
In the dark misty paths of fear and woe,
We weary out our souls and waste our toil;
But if we harvest in the richer soil
Of towering thoughts       where holy breezes blow,
And everlasting flowers in beauty smile       
No disappointment shall the labourer know.
Methought I saw a fair and sparkling gem
In this rude casket       but thy shrewder eye,
Wangner! a jewell       d coronet 
could descry.
Take, then, the bright, unreal diadem!
Worldlings may doubt and smile insultingly,
The hidden stores of truth are not for them.

9To the Same, from Fouqu        
We must, dear Edward, protect the history of poor 
Schlemihl       and so protect it that it may be concealed from 
the eyes that are not to look into it.       This is a 
disagreeable business; for of such eyes there is a multitude, and
what mortal can decide what shall be the fate of a MS. which is 
more hard to guard than even an uttered word.       In truth, I 
feel as if my head were turning round, and in my anguish jump 
into the abyss       let the whole affair be printed!
But, Edward! there are really stronger and better grounds for 
this decision.       Unless I am wholly deceived, there beat in 
our beloved Germany many hearts which are able and worthy to 
understand poor Schlemihl, and a tranquil smile will light upon 
the countenance of many an honest countryman of ours at the <!-- 
page 10-->p. 
10bitter sport in which life with him       and the simple
sport in which he with himself is engaged.       And you, Edward,
you, looking into this so sincerely-grounded book, and thinking 
how many unknown hearts this may learn with us to love 
it       you will let a drop of balsam fall into the deep wound, 
which death hath inflicted upon you and all that love you.
And to conclude: there is       I know there is, from manifold
experience       a genius that takes charge of every printed book
and delivers it into the appropriate hands, and if not always, 
yet very often keeps at home the undeserving: that genius holds 
the key to every true production of heart and soul, and opens and
closes it with never-failing dexterity.
To this genius, my much beloved Schlemihl! I confide thy 
smiles and thy tears, and thus to God commend them.
FOUQU        .
Neunhausen, May 31, 1814.

11To Fouqu        , from Hitzig
We have done, then, the desperate deed: there is 
Schlemihl       s story which we were to preserve to ourselves as
our own secret, and lo! not only Frenchmen and Englishmen, 
Dutchmen and Spaniards have translated it, and Americans have 
reprinted it from the English text, as I announced to my own 
erudite Berlin, but now in our beloved Germany a new edition 
appears with the English etchings, which the illustrious 
Cruikshank sketched from the life, and wider still will the story
be told.       Not a word didst thou mutter to me in 1814, of the
publication of the MS., and did I not deem thy reckless 
enterprise suitably punished by the complaints of our Chamisso, 
in his Voyage round the World from 1815 to 1818       complaints 
urged in Chili and Kamtschatka, and uttered even to his departed 
friend Tameramaia <span 
class="pagenum">p. 12of Owahee, I should even now demand 
of you crowning retribution.
However       this by the by       bygones are 
bygones       and you are right in this       that many, many 
friendly ones have looked upon the little book with affection 
during the thirteen eventful years since it saw the world       s
light.       I shall never forget the hour when I first read it 
to Hoffmann.       He was beside himself with delight and 
eagerness, and hung upon my lips till I got to the end.       He 
could not wait, not he, to make the personal acquaintance of the 
poet;       but though he hates all imitation, he could not 
withstand the temptation to copy       though not very 
felicitously       the idea of the lost shadow in the lost mirror
picture of Crasinus Spekhn, in his tale of the        Last Night 
of the Year.              Yes, even among children has our 
marvellous history found its way, for on a bright winter evening,
as I was going up the Borough-street with its narrator, a boy 
busied with his sledge laughed at him, upon which he tucked the 
boy under his bear-skin mantle       you know it well       and 
while he carried him he remained perfectly quiet until he was set
down on the footway       and then       having <a
name="page13">p. 13made off to a
distance, where he felt safe as if nothing had happened, he 
shouted aloud to his captor              Nay, stop, Peter 
Schlemihl!       
Methinks, the honourable scarecrow, clad now in trist and 
fashionable attire, may be welcome to those who never saw him in 
his modest kurtka of 1814.       These and those will be 
surprised in the botanizing, circumnavigating       the once 
well-appointed Royal Prussian officer, in the historiographer of 
the illustrious Peter Schlemihl, to discover a lyric whose 
poetical heart is rightly fixed, whether he sing in Malayan or 
Lithuanian.
Thanks, then, dear Fouqu        , heartfelt thanks, for the 
launching of the first edition, and with our friends, receive my 
wishes for the prosperity of the second.
Edward 
Hitzig.
Berlin, January, 1827.

With the second edition of Schlemihl, appeared 
Chamisso       s Songs and Ballads.       His Travels round the 
World, have also been published.       Among his poetry are 
translations from various languages.

15PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION.
More than twenty years ago I translated        Peter 
Schlemihl.              I had the advantage of the pen and genius
of George Cruikshank, to make the work popular, and two editions 
were rapidly sold.
At that time the real author was unknown.       Everybody 
attributed it to Lamotte Fouqu        , on whose literary 
shoulders, indeed, Adelbert von Chamisso placed the burden of its
responsibilities.
The appearance of the English edition, I have reason to 
know       thanks to the merit of Cruikshank       s original and
felicitous sketches       excited the greatest delight in the 
mind of Chamisso.       In his autobiography he says that 
       Peter        had been kindly received in Germany, but in 
England had been renowned (volksthumlich).
p. 
16Several English translations have since occupied the 
field.       Mine, as the first-born, naturally claims its own 
heritage, though it has been long out of print, and in the shape 
of a third edition, commends itself anew to public patronage.

17To my old Friend, Peter Schlemihl.
Well! years and years have pass       d,       and lo! thy 
writing
             Comes to my hands again,       and, strange to 
say,
I think of times when the world       s school, inviting
             Our early friendship, new before us lay;       <br 
/>
Now I can laugh at foolish shame       delighting
             In thee, for I am old       my hair is 
grey,       
And I will call thee friend, as then       not coldly,
But proudly to the world       and claim thee boldly.
My dear, dear Friend! the cunning air hath led me
             Through paths less dark and less perplexed than 
thine,
Struggling for blue, bright dawnings, have I sped me,
             But little, little glory has been mine.
Yet can the Grey Man boast not that he had me
             Fast by my shadow!       Nay! he must 
resign
His claims on me,       my shadow       s mine.       I boast 
it,       
I had it from the first, and never lost it.
On me       though guiltless as a child       the throng
             Flung all their mockery of thy naked 
being,       
And is the likeness then so very strong?
             They shouted for my shadow       which, 
though seeing,
They swore they saw not       and, still bent on wrong,
             Said they were blind; and then put forth their glee 
in
Peals upon peals of laughter!       Well       we bear
With patience       aye, with joy       the conscience clear.
p. 
18And what       what is the Shadow? may I ask ye,
             Who am myself so wearyingly asked.
Is it too high a problem, then, to task ye?
             And shall not the malignant world be tasked?
The flights of nineteen thousand days unmask ye,
             They have brought wisdom       in whose trains I 
basked,
And while I gave to shadows, being       saw
Being, as shadows, from life       s scene withdraw.
Give me thy hand, Schlemihl       take mine, my friend:
             On, on,       we leave the future to the Grey 
Man,
Careless about the world,       our hearts shall blend
             In firmer, stronger union       come away, man!<br 
/>
We shall glide fast and faster towards life       s end.
             Aye! let them smile or scorn, for all they say, 
man,
The tempests will be still       d that shake the deep,
And we in part sleep our untroubled sleep.

Berlin, August, 1834.
p. 
19To Julius Edward Hitzig, from Adelbert von 
Chamisso.
You forget nobody, and surely you must remember one Peter 
Schlemihl, whom you now and then met at my house in former days; 
a long-shanked fellow, who had the credit of awkwardness because 
he was unpolished, and whose negligence gave him an air of 
habitual laziness.       I loved him       you cannot have 
forgotten, Edward, how often, in the spring-time of our youth, he
was the subject of our rhymes.       Once I recollect introducing
him to a poetical tea-party, where he fell asleep while I was 
writing, even without waiting to hear anything read.       And 
that brings to my mind a witty thing you said about him; you had 
often seen him, heaven knows where and when, in an old <!-- page 
20-->p. 20black
kurtka, <a href="#footnote20" 
class="citation">[20] which in fact he always wore, and you 
declared        he would be a lucky fellow if his soul were half 
as immortal as his kurtka!              So little did you value 
him.       I loved him, I repeat; and to this Schlemihl, whom I 
had not seen for many a year, we owe the following sheets.       
To you, Edward, to you only, my nearest, dearest friend       my 
better self, from whom I can hide no secret,       to you I 
commit them; to you only, and of course to Fouqu        , who, 
like yourself, is rooted in my soul       but to him as a friend 
alone, and not as a poet.       You can easily imagine, how 
unpleasant it would be to me, if the secret reposed by an 
honourable man, confiding in my esteem and sincerity, should be 
exposed in the pillory of an         pop        e, or in 
any way distorted, as if some miserable witling had engendered 
unnatural and impossible things.       Indeed, I must frankly own
it is a very shame that a history, which another and cleverer 
hand might have exhibited in all its comic force, has been 
reduced to mere insipidity <a 
name="page21">p. 21by our good 
man       s pen.       What would not John Paul Richter have made
of it!       In a word, my dear friend, many who are yet alive 
may be named, but       
One word more on the way in which these leaves came into my 
hands.       Yesterday morning early       as soon as I was 
up       they were presented to me.       A strange man with a 
long grey beard, wearing a black, worn-out kurtka, with a 
botanical case suspended at his side, and slippers over his 
boots, on account of the damp rainy weather, inquired after me, 
and left these papers behind him.       He pretended he came from
Berlin.

23CHAPTER I.
At last, after a fortunate, but to me most tedious passage, we
reached our destined haven.       As soon as the boat had landed 
me on the shore, I loaded myself with my little possessions, and 
forcing my way through the swarming crowd, entered the first and 
meanest house distinguished by a sign-board.       I ordered a 
chamber; the waiter measured me with a glance, and sent me up to 
the garret.
I ordered fresh water, and inquired for the abode of Mr. 
Thomas Jones.              Near the North gate, the first country
house on the right-hand side; a large new house of red and white 
marble, supported by many pillars.              Well; it was yet 
early; I opened my bundle, laid out my newly-turned black coat, 
clad myself in my sprucest garments, put my letter of 
introduction into my pocket, and bent my way to the man, who, I 
modestly hoped, was destined to befriend me.
p. 
24After I had gone through the long North-street, and 
reached the gate, I saw the columns glimmering through the green 
trees.              It is here, then,        I thought.       I 
wiped the dust from my feet with my pocket-handkerchief, arranged
my cravat, and rung the bell.       The door flew open, the 
servants narrowly examined me in the hall, but the porter at last
announced me, and I had the honour to be summoned into the park, 
where Mr. Jones was walking with a small company.       I knew 
him instantly by his portly self-complacency.       He received 
me tolerably well       as a rich man is wont to receive a poor 
dependent devil; looked towards me, but without turning from the 
rest of the company, and took from me the letter I held in my 
hand.              Aye, aye! from my brother; I have not heard 
from him a long time.       Is he well?       
There              he continued, addressing the company without 
waiting for an answer, and pointed with the letter to a hill, 
       There I have ordered a new building to be 
erected.              He broke the seal, but not the 
conversation, of which wealth became the subject.              He
who is not the master of at least a million,        he 
interposed,        forgive the expression, is a 
ragamuffin.                     That is true, indeed,        
exclaimed I, with full, overflowing feeling.       He must have 
p. 
25been pleased with the expression of my concurrence, for 
he smiled on me and said,        Remain here, young friend: I 
shall perhaps have time to tell you, by and by, what I think of 
it.              He pointed to the letter, put it into his 
pocket, and turned again to the company.       He then offered 
his arm to a young lady; other gentlemen were busied with other 
fair ones; every one found some one to whom he attached himself, 
and they walked towards the rose-encircled hill.
I lingered idly behind, for not a soul deemed me worthy of 
notice.       The company was extremely cheerful, jocular, and 
witty; they spoke seriously of trifles, and triflingly of serious
matters; and I observed they unconcernedly directed their satires
against the persons and the circumstances of absent 
friends.       I was too great a stranger to understand much of 
these discussions; too much distressed and self-retired to enter 
into the full merit of these enigmas.
We reached the rose-grove.       The lovely Fanny, the queen, 
as it seemed, of the day, was capricious enough to wish to gather
for herself a blooming branch; a thorn pricked her, and a stream,
as bright as if from damask roses, flowed over her delicate 
hand.       This accident put the whole company in motion.       
English court-plaister was instantly inquired after.       A 
silent, <span 
class="pagenum">p. 26meagre, pale, tall, elderly man, who 
stood next to me, and whom I had not before observed, instantly 
put his hand into the close-fitting breast-pocket of his 
old-fashioned, grey taffetan coat, took out a small pocket-book, 
opened it, and with a lowly bow gave the lady what she had wished
for; she took it without any attention to the giver, and without 
a word of thanks.       The wound was bound up, and they ascended
the hill, from whose brow they admired the wide prospect over the
park       s green labyrinth, extending even to the immeasurable 
ocean.
It was indeed a grand and noble sight.       A light speck 
appeared on the horizon between the dark waters and the azure 
heaven.              A telescope, here!        cried the 
merchant; and before any one from the crowds of servants appeared
to answer his call, the grey man, as if he had been applied to, 
had already put his hand into his coat-pocket: he had taken from 
it a beautiful Dollond, and handed it over to Mr. Jones; who, as 
soon as he had raised it to his eye, informed the company that it
was the ship which had sailed yesterday, driven back by contrary 
winds.       The telescope passed from hand to hand, but never 
again reached that of its owner.       I, however, looked on the 
old man with astonishment, <a 
name="page27">p. 27not 
conceiving how the large machine had come out of the tiny 
pocket.       Nobody else seemed surprised, and they appeared to 
care no more about the grey man than about me.
Refreshments were produced; the rarest fruits of every 
climate, served in the richest dishes.       Mr. Jones did the 
honours with easy, dignified politeness, and for the second time 
directed a word to me:        Eat then, you did not get this on 
your voyage.              I bowed, but he did not observe me: he 
was talking to somebody else.
They would willingly have remained longer on the sod of the 
sloping hill, and have stretched themselves over the outspread 
turf, had they not feared its dampness.              Now it would
be enchanting,        said somebody of the company,        if we 
had Turkey carpets to spread here.              The wish was 
hardly expressed ere the man in the grey coat had put his hand 
into his pocket, and with modest, even humble demeanour, began to
draw out a rich embroidered Turkey carpet.       It was received 
by the attendants as a matter of course, and laid down on the 
appointed spot.       Without further ceremony the company took 
their stand upon it.       I looked with new surprise on the man,
the pocket, and the carpet, which was about twenty paces long, 
and ten broad.       I rubbed my eyes, not knowing <!-- page 
28-->p. 28what 
to think, and especially as nobody else seemed moved by what had 
passed.
I longed to learn something about the man, and to inquire who 
he was; but I knew not to whom to apply, for I really was more 
afraid of the gentlemen-servants than of the gentlemen 
served.       I mustered up my spirits at last, and addressed 
myself to a young man who seemed less pretending than the rest, 
and who had oftener been left to himself.       I gently asked 
him, who that courteous gentleman was in grey 
clothes.              Who? he that looks like an end of thread 
blown away from a tailor       s needle?                     Yes,
he that stands alone.                     I do not know 
him,        he answered; and, determined, as it seemed, to break 
off the discussion with me, turned away, and entered on a 
trifling conversation with somebody else.
The sun now began to shine more intensely, and to annoy the 
ladies.       The lovely Fanny carelessly addressed the grey man,
whom, as far as I know, nobody had addressed before, with the 
frivolous question:        had he a marquee?              He 
answered with a low reverence, as if feeling an undeserved honour
had been done him; his hand was already in his pocket, from which
I perceived canvas, bars, ropes, iron-work       everything, in a
word, belonging to <span 
class="pagenum">p. 29the most sumptuous tent, issuing 
forth.       The young men helped to erect it; it covered the 
whole extent of the carpet, and no one appeared to consider all 
this as at all extraordinary.
If my mind was confused, nay terrified, with these 
proceedings, how was I overpowered when the next-breathed wish 
brought from his pocket three riding horses.       I tell you, 
three great and noble steeds, with saddles and 
appurtenances!       Imagine for a moment, I pray you, three 
saddled horses from the same pocket which had before produced a 
pocket-book, a telescope, an ornamented carpet twenty paces long 
and ten broad, a pleasure-tent of the same size, with bars and 
iron-work!       If I did not solemnly assure you that I had seen
it, with my own eyes, you would certainly doubt the 
narrative.
Though there was so much of embarrassment and humility in the 
man, and he excited so little attention, yet his appearance to me
had in it something so appalling, that I was not able to turn 
away my eyes from him.       At last I could bear it no 
longer.
I determined to steal away from the company; and this was easy
for one who had acted a part so little conspicuous.       I 
wished to hasten back to the city, and to return in pursuit of my
fortune the following morning to Mr. J., and if <a
name="page30">p. 30I could 
muster up courage enough, to inquire something about the 
extraordinary grey man.       Oh, had I been thus privileged to 
escape!
I had hastily glided through the rose-grove, descended the 
hill, and found myself on a wide grassplot, when, alarmed with 
the apprehension of being discovered wandering from the beaten 
path, I looked around me with enquiring apprehension.       How 
was I startled when I saw the old man in the grey coat behind, 
and advancing towards me!       He immediately took off his hat, 
and bowed to me more profoundly than any one had ever done 
before.       It was clear he wished to address me, and without 
extreme rudeness I could not avoid him.       I, in my turn, 
uncovered myself, made my obeisance, and stood still with a bare 
head, in the sunshine, as if rooted there.       I shook with 
terror while I saw him approach; I felt like a bird fascinated by
a rattlesnake.       He appeared sadly perplexed, kept his eyes 
on the ground, made several bows, approached nearer, and with a 
low and trembling voice, as if he were asking alms, thus accosted
me:       
       Will the gentleman forgive the intrusion of one who has
stopt him in this unusual way?       I have a request to make, 
but pray pardon . . .                     In the name of heaven, 
Sir!        I cried out in my anguish,        what can I do for 
one who                     We <a 
name="page31">p. 31both started 
back, and methought both blushed deeply.
After a momentary silence he again began:        During the 
short time when I enjoyed the happiness of being near you, I 
observed, Sir,       will you allow me to say so       I 
observed, with unutterable admiration, the beautiful, beautiful 
shadow in the sun, which with a certain noble contempt, and 
perhaps without being aware of it, you threw off from your feet; 
forgive me this, I confess, too daring intrusion, but should you 
be inclined to transfer it to me?       
He was silent, and my head turned round like a 
water-wheel.       What could I make of this singular proposal 
for disposing of my shadow?       He is crazy! thought I; and 
with an altered tone, yet more forcible, as contrasted with the 
humility of his own, I replied:
       How is this, good friend?       Is not your own shadow 
enough for you?       This seems to me a whimsical sort of 
bargain indeed.              He began again,        I have in my 
pocket many matters which might not be quite unacceptable to the 
gentleman; for this invaluable shadow I deem any price too 
little.       
A chill came over me: I remembered what I had seen, and knew 
not how to address him who I had just ventured to call my good 
friend.       <span 
class="pagenum">p. 32I spoke again, and assumed an 
extraordinary courtesy to set matters in order.
       Pardon, Sir, pardon your most humble servant, I do not 
quite understand your meaning; how can my 
shadow                     He interrupted me:        I only beg 
your permission to be allowed to lift up your noble shadow, and 
put it in my pocket: how to do it is my own affair.       As a 
proof of my gratitude for the gentleman, I leave him the choice 
of all the jewels which my pocket affords; the genuine divining 
rods, mandrake roots, change pennies, money extractors, the 
napkins of Rolando       s Squire, and divers other 
miracle-workers,       a choice assortment; but all this is not 
fit for you       better that you should have Fortunatus       s 
wishing-cap, restored spick and span new; and also a fortune-bag 
which belonged to him.                     Fortunatus       s 
fortune-bag!        I exclaimed; and, great as had been my 
terror, all my senses were now enraptured by the sound.       I 
became dizzy,       and nothing but double ducats seemed 
sparkling before my eyes.
       Condescend, Sir, to inspect and make a trial of this 
bag.              He put his hand into his pocket, and drew from 
it a moderately sized, firmly-stitched purse of thick cordovan, 
with two convenient leather cords hanging to it, which he 
presented to me.       I instantly dipped <a 
name="page33">p. 33into it, drew
from it ten pieces of gold, and ten more, and ten more, and yet 
ten more;       I stretched out my hand.              Done! the 
bargain is made; I give you my shadow for your 
purse.              He grasped my hand, and knelt down behind me,
and with wonderful dexterity I perceived him loosening my shadow 
from the ground from head to foot;       he lifted it 
up;       he rolled it together and folded it, and at last put it
into his pocket.       He then stood erect, bowed to me again, 
and returned back to the rose grove.       I thought I heard him 
laughing softly to himself.       I held, however, the purse 
tight by its strings       the earth was sun-bright all around 
me       and my senses were still wholly confused.
p. 
34CHAPTER II.
At last I came to myself, and hastened from a place where 
apparently I had nothing more to do.       I first filled my 
pockets with gold, then firmly secured the strings of the purse 
round my neck, taking care to conceal the purse itself in my 
bosom.       I left the park unnoticed, reached the high road, 
and bent my way to the town.       I was walking thoughtfully 
towards the gate, when I heard a voice behind me:        Holla! 
young Squire! holla! don       t you hear?              I looked 
round       an old woman was calling after me;              Take 
care, sir, take care       you have lost your 
shadow!                     Thanks, good woman.              I 
threw her a piece of gold for her well-meant counsel, and walked 
away under the trees.
At the gate I was again condemned to hear from the sentinel, 
       Where has the gentleman left his shadow?        and 
immediately afterwards a couple of women exclaimed,        Good 
heavens! the poor fellow has no shadow!              I began to 
be vexed, and carefully avoided walking in the <a 
name="page35">p. 35sun.       
This I could not always do: for instance, in the Broad-street, 
which I was next compelled to cross; and as ill-luck would have 
it, at the very moment when the boys were being released from 
school.       A confounded hunch-backed vagabond       I see him 
at this moment       had observed that I wanted a shadow.       
He instantly began to bawl out to the young tyros of the suburbs,
who first criticised me, and then bespattered me with mud: 
       Respectable people are accustomed to carry their shadows 
with them when they go into the sun.              I scattered 
handfuls of gold among them to divert their attention; and, with 
the assistance of some compassionate souls, sprang into a hackney
coach.       As soon as I found myself alone in the rolling 
vehicle, I began to weep bitterly.       My inward emotion 
suggested to me, that even as in this world gold weighs down both
merit and virtue, so a shadow might possibly be more valuable 
than gold itself; and that, as I had sacrificed my riches to my 
integrity on other occasions, so now I had given up my shadow for
mere wealth; and what ought, what could become of me?
I continued still sadly discomposed, when the coach stopped 
before the old tavern.       I was shocked at the thought of 
again entering that <span 
class="pagenum">p. 36vile garret.       I sent for my 
baggage, took up the miserable bundle with contempt, threw the 
servants some pieces of gold, and ordered to be driven to the 
principal hotel.       The house faced the north, so I had 
nothing to fear from the sun.       I dismissed the driver with 
gold, selected the best front room, and locked myself in as soon 
as possible.
And how do you imagine I employed myself?       Oh! my beloved
Chamisso, I blush to confess it even to you.       I drew forth 
the luckless purse from my bosom, and impelled by a sort of 
madness which burned and spread within me like a furious 
conflagration, I shook out gold, and gold, and gold, and still 
more gold;       strewed it over the floor, trampled on it, and 
made it tinkle, and feasting my weak senses on the glitter and 
the sound, I added pile to pile, till I sunk exhausted on the 
golden bed.       I rolled about and wallowed in delicious 
delirium.       And so the day passed by, and so the 
evening.       My door remained unopened, and night found me 
still reposing on the gold, when sleep at length overcame me.
Then I dreamed of you.       I fancied I was standing close to
the glass door of your little apartment, and saw you sitting at 
your work-table, between a skeleton and a parcel of dried <!-- 
page 37-->p. 
37plants.       Haller, Humboldt, and Linn       us lay 
open before you;       on your sofa were a volume of Goethe, and 
The Magic Ring. <a 
href="#footnote37" class="citation">[37]       I looked at 
you for a long time, then at everything around you, and then at 
you again; but you moved not       you breathed not       you 
were dead.
I awoke: it seemed to be yet early       my watch had 
stopped;       I felt as if I had been bastinadoed       yet both
hungry and thirsty, for since the previous morning I had eaten 
nothing.       With weariness and disgust I pushed away from me 
the gold, which but a little time before had satiated my foolish 
heart: I now in my perplexity knew not how to dispose of 
it.       But it could not remain there.       I tried to put it 
again into the purse       no; none of my windows opened upon the
sea.       I was obliged to content myself by dragging it with 
immense labour and difficulty to a large cupboard, which stood in
a recess, where I packed it up.       I left only a few handfuls 
lying about.       When I had finished my labour, I sat down 
exhausted in an arm-chair, and waited till the people of the 
house began to stir.       I ordered breakfast, and begged the 
landlord to be with me as soon as practicable.
With this man I arranged the future management of my 
household.       He recommended to <a 
name="page38">p. 38me for my 
personal servant a certain Bendel, whose honest and 
intelligent countenance instantly interested me.       It was he,
who from that moment accompanied me through life with a 
sympathizing attachment, and shared with me my gloomy 
destiny.       I passed the whole day in my apartments with 
servants out of place, shoemakers, tailors, and shopkeepers; I 
provided myself with all necessaries, and bought large quantities
of jewels and precious stones, merely to get rid of some of my 
piles of gold; but it seemed scarcely possible to diminish the 
heap.
Meanwhile I contemplated my situation with most anxious 
doubts.       I dared not venture one step from my door, and at 
evening ordered forty wax-lights to be kindled in my saloon, 
before I left the dark chamber.       I thought with horror of 
the dreadful scene with the schoolboys, and determined, whatever 
it might cost, once more to sound public opinion.       The moon,
at this season, illumined the night.       Late in the evening I 
threw a wide cloak around me, pulled down my hat over my eyes, 
and glided out of the house trembling like a criminal.       I 
walked first along the shadows of the houses to a remote open 
place; I then abandoned their protection, stepped out into the 
moonshine, resolving <span 
class="pagenum">p. 39to learn my destiny from the lips of 
the passers-by.
But spare me, my friend, the painful repetition of what I was 
condemned to undergo!       The deepest pity seemed to inspire 
the fairer sex; but my soul was not less wounded by this than by 
the contumely of the young, and the proud disdain of the old, 
especially of those stout and well-fed men, whose dignified 
shadows seemed to do them honour.       A lovely, graceful 
maiden, apparently accompanying her parents, who seemed not to 
look beyond their own footsteps, accidentally fixed her sparkling
eyes upon me.       She obviously started as she remarked my 
shadowless figure; she hid her beautiful face beneath her veil, 
hung down her head, and passed silently on.
I could bear it no longer.       Salt streams burst forth from
my eyes, and with a broken heart I hurried tremblingly back into 
darkness.       I was obliged to grope along by the houses, in 
order to feel my steps secure, and slowly and late I reached my 
dwelling.
That night was a sleepless one.       My first care at 
daybreak was to order the man in the grey coat to be everywhere 
sought for.       Perchance I might be lucky enough to discover 
him       and oh! what bliss if he as well as I repented of <!-- 
page 40-->p. 
40our foolish bargain.       I sent for Bendel; he seemed 
both apt and active.       I described to him minutely the man 
who held in his possession that treasure, without which life was 
but a torment to me.       I told him the time, the place where I
had seen him; particularized to him all the persons who could 
assist his inquiries; and added, that he should especially ask 
after a Dollond       s telescope, a gold embroidered Turkish 
carpet, a superb tent, and also the black riding horses; whose 
history,       I did not state how,       was closely connected 
with that of the unintelligible man, whom nobody seemed to 
notice, and whose appearance had destroyed the peace and 
happiness of my life.
When I had done, I brought out as much gold as I was able to 
carry.       I laid jewels and precious stones to a still greater
amount upon the pile.              Bendel,        I said, 
       this levels many a path, and makes many a difficult thing 
easy; be not sparing, you know I am not; but go and rejoice your 
master with the information on which his only hopes are 
built.       
He went       he returned       and returned late and 
sorrowful.       None of the merchant       s servants, none of 
his guests       he had spoken to all       knew anything about 
the man in the grey coat.       The new telescope was there, but 
they p.
41were all ignorant whence it came.       The tent and the
carpet were extended on the same hill; the lackeys boasted of 
their master       s magnificence: but none knew from what place 
these new valuables had come.       They had administered to his 
pleasures; and he did not disturb his rest to inquire into their 
origin.       Their horses were in the stalls of the young men 
who had rode them; and they lauded the generosity of the 
merchant, who had that day requested they would keep them as 
presents.       Such was the light that Bendel threw upon this 
extraordinary history, and for this fruitless result received my 
grateful thanks.       I beckoned gloomily to him that he should 
leave me alone.       But he resumed:        I have informed you,
sir, of everything connected with the affair which most interests
you.       I have also a message to deliver, which was given to 
me this morning early, by a person whom I met at the door, while 
I was going out on the business in which I have been so 
unfortunate.       His own words were,        Say to Mr. Peter 
Schlemihl, he will see me here no more, as I am going to cross 
the sea; and a favourable wind beckons me to the haven.       But
after a year and a day I shall have the honour to seek him out, 
and perhaps to propose to him another arrangement which <!-- page
42-->p. 42may 
then be to his liking.       Remember me most obediently to him, 
and assure him of my thanks.              I asked him who he was:
and he replied, that you knew.
       What was the man       s appearance?        I cried, 
full of forebodings.       And Bendel described the man in the 
grey coat, feature by feature, word for word, precisely as he had
depicted him, when inquiring about him.
       Miserable mortal!        exclaimed I, wringing my 
hands,        it was he! it was he himself!              He 
looked as if scales had fallen from his eyes.              Yes, 
it was he, it was indeed he!        he cried out in agony; 
       and I, silly, deluded one, I did not know him       I did 
not know him       I have betrayed my master!       
He broke out into the loudest reproaches against 
himself.       He wept bitterly; his despair could not but excite
my pity.       I ministered consolation to him; assured him again
and again that I did not doubt his fidelity, and sent him 
instantly to the haven, to follow the strange man       s steps 
if possible.       But, on that very morning, many vessels which 
had been kept by contrary winds back in port, had put to sea, all
destined to distant lands and other climes; the grey man had 
disappeared trackless as a shade.
p. 
43CHAPTER III.
Of what use would wings be to him who is fast bound in iron 
fetters?       He must still despair, and despair with deeper 
melancholy.       I lay like Taffner by his stronghold, far 
removed from any earthly consolation, starving in the midst of 
riches.       They gave me no enjoyment; I cursed them; they had 
cut me off from mankind.       Concealing my gloomy secret within
me, I trembled before the meanest of my servants, whom I could 
not but envy: for he had his shadow, and could show himself in 
the sun.       Alone in my apartments, I mourned through 
harassing days and nights, and anguish fed upon my heart.
One individual was constantly sorrowing under my eyes.       
My faithful Bendel ceased not to torment himself with silent 
reproaches that he had deceived the confidence of his generous 
master, and had not recognized him whom he was sent to seek, and 
with whom my mournful fate seemed strongly intertwined.       I 
could not blame him: I recognized too well in that <!-- page 
44-->p. 44event
the mysterious nature of the unknown being.
But, to leave nothing untried, I sent Bendel with a costly 
brilliant ring to the most celebrated painter in the city, 
requesting he would pay me a visit.       He came       I ordered
away my servants       locked the door       sat myself by him; 
and after praising his art, I came with a troubled spirit to the 
great disclosure, having first enjoined on him the strictest 
secresy.
       Mr. Professor,        I began,        can you paint a 
false shadow for one, who in the most luckless way in the world 
has lost his own?                     You mean a reflected 
shadow?                     To be sure.              
       But,        he added,        through what awkwardness, or 
what negligence, could he lose his own 
shadow?                     How it happened,        replied I, 
       that does not matter, but               I impudently began
again with a lie,              last winter, when he was 
travelling in Russia, it froze so severely, during the 
extraordinary cold, that his shadow was frozen to the ground, and
it was impossible for him to get it free.       
       And I,        said the professor,        could only 
make him a sheet shadow, which he would be apt to lose again on 
the slightest motion; especially for one whose genuine shadow was
so badly fixed, as must be inferred from your <a 
name="page45">p. 45account; the 
simplest and wisest determination for him who has no shadow, is 
not to go in the sun.              He stood up and walked away, 
after having sent through me a piercing glance which I could not 
endure.       I sunk back on my chair, and veiled my face with my
hands.
Thus Bendel found me when he entered.       He saw his 
master       s sorrow, and wanted silently and respectfully to 
turn back.       I raised my eyes: the weight of my grief was 
upon me       I determined to divide it.       
       Bendel!        I called to him;        Bendel! you, who 
alone see and respect my sufferings, not curiously prying into 
them, but secretly and devotedly sharing them with me       come 
to me, Bendel, be the nearest to my heart.       The stores of my
gold I have not concealed from you: from you I will not hide the 
store of my anguish.       Bendel, forsake me not.       You know
I am wealthy, kind, and generous, and perhaps you think the world
should honour me for that: but, you see, I shun the world; I hide
myself from its observation.       Bendel, the world has judged 
me and condemned me       and Bendel, too, perhaps, will turn 
from me when he possesses my dreadful secret.       Bendel!      
I am indeed rich, liberal, and independent, 
but       heavens!       I have no shadow!       
p. 
46       No shadow!        echoed the good young man in an
agony, while bright tears broke from his eyelids;        Alas! 
alas! that I should have been born to serve a shadowless 
master!              He was silent, and I hid my face in my 
hands.
At last I tremblingly said,        Bendel! you have now my 
confidence       betray it if you will       away! and bear 
witness against me.              He seemed struggling with 
internal emotion; he threw himself at my feet, seized my hand, 
and bathed it with his tears.              No,        he cried, 
       let the world say what it may, I will not leave my good 
master for the sake of a shadow; I will do what is right and not 
what is prudent: I will remain with you, I will lend you my 
shadow; I will help you where I can; I will weep with 
you.              I fell on his neck, overcome with such an 
unexpected self-devotion.       I felt assured he did nothing for
the sake of gold.
From that moment my fate and my mode of life changed.       It
is indescribable how carefully Bendel sought to cover my 
defects.       He was ever before and with me, foreseeing 
everything, arranging everything, and where unexpected danger 
threatened, covering me with his shadow, for he was fortunately 
taller and stouter than I.       Again I mingled with mankind, 
and acted my part in the scenes of the world.       It <!-- page 
47-->p. 47was 
necessary to assume much singularity and queerness; but these sit
well upon a rich man, and while the truth lay concealed, I 
enjoyed all the honour and esteem to which wealth has a 
claim.       I looked with more calmness on the advancing year 
and day, whose close was to bring with them the visit of the 
mysterious unknown.
I was well aware that I could not remain long in the place 
where I had been seen without a shadow, and where I might so 
easily be betrayed; and I thought perhaps more on this, 
remembering how I had first shown myself to the merchant, which 
was now a sad recollection to me; consequently I would only make 
an experiment here, that I might learn how to introduce myself 
hereafter with more ease and confidence; nevertheless it happened
that I was momentarily bound down by my vanity; which is the firm
ground in man where the anchor fixes itself.
The beautiful Fanny, whom I again met in another situation, 
bestowed on me some attention, without recollecting that she had 
seen me before; for now I had both wit and understanding.       
When I talked, all listened, and I could not imagine when or how 
I had acquired the talent of leading and directing the 
conversation.       <span 
class="pagenum">p. 48The impression which I perceived I 
had produced on the fair one, made me, as she would have me, a 
very fool; and from this time I pursued her, where only I could 
pursue her, through shades and twilight.       I was vain enough 
to make her vain of me; yet I could not succeed, notwithstanding 
all my efforts to drive the intoxication from my head to my 
heart.




But why enter upon the details of an everyday story?       You
know, and have often told me, how other wealthy people spend 
their days.       From an old, well-known drama, in which I, out 
of mere good-humour, was playing a hacknied part, arose a 
singular and incredible catastrophe, unexpected by me, or by 
Fanny, or by anybody.
According to my custom, one lovely evening I had assembled a 
large company in an illuminated garden.       I was wandering 
about with my divinity arm-in-arm, separated from the rest of the
guests, and endeavouring to amuse her with well-timed 
conversation; she looked modestly towards the ground, and gently 
returned the pressure of my hand.       At this moment the moon 
unexpectedly burst through the clouds: her shadow alone was 
there,       she started, looked alarmed at me, then at the 
earth, as if <span 
class="pagenum">p. 49her eyes were asking for my 
shadow;       all her emotions were painted so faithfully on her 
countenance, that I should have burst into a loud laugh, had I 
not felt an icy dullness creeping over me.
She sunk down from my arms in a swoon.       I flew like an 
arrow through the alarmed company, reached the door, threw myself
into the first coach I found waiting there, and hurried back to 
the city, where, to my misfortune, I had left the foresighted 
Bendel.       He was startled at seeing me       a word told 
all.       Post-horses were instantly ordered.       I took only 
one of my servants with me, an interested villain called Rascal, 
who had learned to make himself useful by his dexterity, and who 
could suspect nothing of what had occurred.       We travelled a 
hundred miles before night.       Bendel was left behind to 
dismiss my household, to distribute my money by paying my debts, 
and to bring away what was most necessary.       When he overtook
me the next day, I threw myself into his arms, solemnly promising
to commit no farther folly, but to be more discreet in 
future.       We continued our journey without interruption, 
passing over the chain of mountains which formed the frontier; 
and only when on the descent, and separated by the high <!-- page
50-->p. 
50bastions from the land so fatal to my peace, did I allow
myself to be comforted, and hastened away to a watering-place in 
the vicinity, where I sought repose from my disappointments and 
my sorrows.
p. 
51CHAPTER IV.
I must hurry rapidly over a part of my history, on which I 
should rejoice to linger, if I could invoke the living spirit of 
departed time.       But the beautiful associations which 
animated it once, and which alone could animate its memory, are 
now extinguished within me.       When I seek them       that 
influence which ruled so mightily over my joys and 
sorrows       my mingled destiny,       I strike in vain against 
a rock, that gives out a living stream no longer; the divinity is
fled.       O how changed is the aspect of those days of 
old!       My intention was now to act an heroic character; but 
it was badly studied, and I a novice on the stage, was forgetting
my part while fascinated by a pair of blue eyes.       In the 
intoxication of the scene, the parents seem eager to close the 
bargain, and the farce ends in a common mockery.       And this 
is all!       So stale, so unprofitable, and so melancholy are 
the revisitings of what beat once so nobly and proudly in my 
bosom.       Mina! as I wept when I lost thee, even now I weep to
p. 
52have lost thee within me.       Am I become so 
old!       Pitiful intellect of man!       Oh, for a pulse-beat 
of those days, a moment of that consciousness,       but 
no!       I am a solitary wave in the dark and desolate sea: and 
the sparkling glass I drank was drugged with misery.
I had previously sent Bendel with bags of gold to fit out a 
dwelling suitable for me in the town.       He had scattered 
about a great deal of money, and talked mysteriously of the 
illustrious stranger whom he had the honour to serve (for I did 
not choose to be named), and this filled the good people with 
strange notions.       As soon as the house was ready for me, 
Bendel returned to convey me thither.       We started 
immediately.
About an hour       s distance from the place, on a sunny 
plain, a great number of persons in gala dresses arrested our 
progress.       The coach stopped: music, bell-ringing, and 
cannonading were heard; a loud acclamation rent the air, and a 
chorus of singularly beautiful maidens in white robes appeared at
the door of the carriage, one of whom, surpassing the rest as the
sun surpasses in brightness the stars of evening, stepped 
forward, and with graceful and modest blushes knelt before me, 
and presented to me on a silken cushion a wreath of laurel, <!-- 
page 53-->p. 
53olive, and rose branches, garlanded together, while she 
uttered some words, which I understood not, of majesty, awe, and 
love, whose soft and silver tones enchanted my ear and my bosom: 
it seemed to me as if the heavenly apparition had once glided 
before me in other days.       The chorus began, and sang the 
praise of a good monarch, and the happiness of his people.
And this happened, my friend, in the bright sunshine: she 
continued to kneel some two steps before me, and I, shadowless, 
dared not spring over the gulf, that I might fall on my knees in 
her angelic presence.       What would I not have given in that 
moment for a shadow!       I was obliged to conceal my shame, my 
anguish, my despair, by sinking back into the carriage.       
Bendel relieved me from my embarrassment: he leaped out from the 
other side       I called him back       and gave him out of my 
little casket, which lay close at hand, a rich diamond crown 
which was intended to adorn the lovely Fanny.       He moved 
forward, and spoke in his master       s name,        who neither
could,        he said,        nor would accept such flattering 
marks of honour; there must have been some error, though he could
not but thank the worthy townspeople for their expressions of 
kindness.              He then <a 
name="page54">p. 54took the 
garland of flowers from its place, and put there instead of it 
the crown of diamonds.       His hand assisted the beautiful 
maiden to rise, and with a look of dignity he sent away the 
clergy, magistrates and deputies.       Nobody was allowed a 
farther audience.       He bade the crowd retire, and make room 
for the horses, and flung himself into the carriage, and off we 
went in a rapid gallop to the town, through the arches of flowers
and laurels which had been erected.       The cannon continued to
thunder       the coach at last reached my abode.       I turned 
hastily through the door, dividing the assembly who had gathered 
together to see me.       The mob cried,        God bless 
him!        under my window; and I ordered double ducats to be 
scattered among them.       At night the town was spontaneously 
illuminated.
And I knew not yet what all this meant, nor who I was imagined
to be.       I sent out Rascal to get information.       He 
discovered that the people believed they had certain information 
that the good king of Prussia was travelling through the country,
under the title of count;       that my adjutant had been 
recognized, and had discovered both himself and me;       in a 
word, that infinite joy had been felt at the certainty of having 
me among them.       They had <a 
name="page55">p. 55ascertained, 
indeed, that as I wished to preserve the strictest 
incognito, it had been wrong to draw up the veil so 
intrudingly;       but as I had expressed my displeasure with so 
much graciousness and kindness, surely my generous heart could 
forgive them.
It was so excellent a joke for my scoundrel servant, that he 
did as much as possible by his sharp remonstrances to confirm the
good people in their opinions.       He gave me a most amusing 
account of his proceedings; and as he saw it animated me, he 
thought to add to my enjoyment by a display of his own knavish 
tricks.       Shall I confess it?       I was not a little 
flattered by even the illusion of being mistaken for the head of 
the kingdom.
I ordered a feast to be provided on the following evening, 
under the trees which overshadowed the expanse in front of my 
house, and the whole town to be invited.       The mysterious 
virtue of my purse, the exertions of Bendel, and the dexterous 
contrivances of Rascal, succeeded in doing wonders in the 
trifling space of time.       It is really astonishing how richly
and beautifully everything was arranged in so short a 
period.       Such pomp and superfluity were exhibited there, and
the richly-fanciful illuminations were so admirably managed, that
p. 
56I felt quite at ease; I had nothing to find fault with, 
and I could not but praise the diligence of my servants.
Evening darkness came on; the guests appeared, and were 
introduced to me.       The word        majesty        was no 
more whispered; but I often heard, uttered in deep awe and 
humility,        the Count.              What could I do?       
The word count satisfied me, and from that moment I was Count 
Peter.       But in the midst of the festive crowd I sought but 
one; at last she appeared; she was the crown, and she wore
it.       She followed her parents modestly, and seemed not to 
know that she was the loveliest of the assemblage.       The 
forest-master, his wife, and daughter were introduced.       I 
said much that was agreeable and obliging to the old people; but 
I stood before their daughter like a checked boy, and could not 
utter a single word.       At last I stammered forth a request 
that she would honour the festival by undertaking that office 
whose badge she bore.       With a touching look she begged 
blushingly that I would excuse her; but more abashed before her 
than she herself, I, as her first subject, offered her my humble 
tribute; and my glance served as a command to all the guests, 
each of whom seemed anxious to meet it.       Over <!-- page 
57-->p. 57this 
joyful festivity presided majesty, innocence, and grace allied 
with beauty.       Mina       s happy parents believed that out 
of respect for them, their child had been elevated to these 
unexpected honours, and I was in an unspeakable transport of 
joy.       I ordered every thing that was left of the jewels, 
pearls, and precious stones which I had purchased with my 
perplexing piles of wealth, to be placed in two covered dishes, 
and distributed in the name of the queen among her playfellows 
and the ladies present; and I ordered gold to be thrown over the 
border fence among the joyous crowds.       On the following 
morning, Bendel communicated to me, in confidence, that the 
suspicions he had formed against Rascal       s integrity were 
fully confirmed; he had yesterday purloined several bags of 
gold.              Let us not envy,        I replied,        the 
poor devil this trifling booty; I scatter my money about 
profusely, why not to him?       Yesterday, he and everybody else
served me nobly, and arranged a delightful 
festivity.              Nothing further was said about it; Rascal
continued to be my head-servant, and Bendel my friend and 
confidant.       He had imagined my wealth to be inexhaustible, 
and he cared not to inquire into its source.       Entering into 
my feelings, he assisted me to find <a 
name="page58">p. 58out constant 
occasions to display my wealth, and to spend it.       Of the 
unknown, pale, sneaking fellow, he only knew that without him I 
could not get released from the curse which bound me, and that I 
dreaded the man on whom my only hope reposed.       Besides, I 
was now convinced he could discover me anywhere, while I could 
find him nowhere; so that I determined to abandon a fruitless 
inquiry, and to await the promised day.
The magnificence of the festival, and my condescension there, 
confirmed the obstinately-credulous inhabitants in their first 
opinion of my dignity.       It appeared very soon, 
notwithstanding, in the newspapers, that the reported journey of 
the king was wholly without foundation.       But I had been a 
king, and a king I was unfortunately compelled to remain; and 
certainly I was one of the richest and kingliest who had ever 
appeared.       But what king could I be?       The world has 
never had cause to complain of any scarcity of monarchs, at least
in our days; and the good people, who had never seen one with 
their own eyes, first fixed on one, and then, equally happily, on
another; but Count Peter continued to be my name.
There once appeared among the visitors to the baths, a 
merchant who had made himself <a 
name="page59">p. 59a bankrupt in
order to get rich, and he enjoyed the general esteem; he was 
accompanied by a broad, palish shadow.       He wished 
ostentatiously to display the wealth he had acquired, and he 
determined to be my rival.       I applied to my bag.       I 
drove on the poor devil at such a rate, that in order to save 
himself he was obliged to become a bankrupt a second time.       
Thus I got rid of him; and by similar means I created in this 
neighbourhood many an idler and a vagabond.
Though I thus lived in apparent kingly pomp and prodigality, 
my habits at home were simple and unpretending.       With 
thoughtful foresight, I had made it a rule that no one except 
Bendel, should on any pretence enter the chamber which I 
occupied.       As long as the sun shone I remained there locked 
in.       People said,        the count is engaged in his 
cabinet.              The crowds of couriers were kept in 
communication by these occupations, for I dispatched and received
them on the most trifling business.       At evening, alone, I 
received company under the trees, or in my saloon, which was 
skilfully and magnificently lighted, according to Bendel       s 
arrangement.       Whenever I went out Bendel watched round me 
with Argus        eyes; my steps were always tending to the 
forester       s garden, <a 
name="page60">p. 60and that only
for the sake of her; the inmost spirit of my existence was
my love.
My good Chamisso, I will hope you have not forgotten what love
is!       I leave much to your filling up.       Mina was indeed 
a love-worthy, good, and gentle girl; I had obtained full 
possession of her thoughts; and in her modesty she could not 
imagine how she had become worthy of my regard, and that I dwelt 
only upon her; but she returned love for love, in the full 
youthful energy of an innocent heart.       She loved like a 
woman; all self-sacrificing, self-forgetting, and living only in 
him who was her life, careless even though she should perish: in 
a word, she truly loved.
But I       oh, what frightful moments!       frightful! yet 
worthy to be recalled.       How often did I weep in 
Bendel       s bosom, after I recovered from the first inebriety 
of rapture! how severely did I condemn myself, that I, a 
shadowless being, should seal, with wily selfishness, the 
perdition of an angel, whose pure soul I had attached to me by 
lies and theft!       Now I determined to unveil myself to her; 
now, with solemn oaths, I resolved to tear myself from her, and 
to fly; then again I broke out into tears, and arranged with 
Bendel for visiting her in the forest-garden again in the 
evening.
p. 
61Sometimes I allowed myself to be flattered with the 
hopes of the now nearly approaching visit of the unknown, 
mysterious old man; and wept anew when I recollected that I had 
sought him in vain.       I had reckoned the day when I was again
to expect to see that awful being.       He had said a year and a
day; and I relied on his word.
Mina       s parents were good, worthy old people, loving 
their only child most tenderly; the whole affair had taken them 
by surprise, and, as matters stood, they knew not how to 
act.       They could never have dreamed that Count Peter should 
think of their child; but it was clear he loved her passionately,
and was loved in return.       The mother, indeed, was vain 
enough to think of the possibility of such an alliance, and to 
prepare for its accomplishment; but the calm good sense of the 
old man never gave such an ambitious hope a moment       s 
consideration.       But they were both convinced of the purity 
of my love, and could do nothing but pray for their child.
A letter is now in my hand which I received about this time 
from Mina.       This is her very character.       I will copy it
for you.
       I know I am a weak, silly girl; for I have 
taught myself to believe my beloved would not <a 
name="page62">p. 62give me pain,
and this because I deeply, dearly love him.       Alas! thou art 
so kind, so unutterably kind! but do not delude me.       For me 
make no sacrifice       wish to make no sacrifice.       
Heaven!       I could hate myself if I caused thee to do 
so.       No, thou hast made me infinitely happy; thou hast 
taught me to love thee.       But go in peace! my destiny tells 
me Count Peter is not mine, but the whole world       s; and then
I shall feel proudly as I hear:        That it was he       and 
he again       that he had done this       that he has been 
adored here, and deified there.              When I think of 
this, I could reproach thee for forgetting thy high destinies in 
a simple maiden.       Go in peace, or the thought will make me 
miserable       me, alas! who am so happy, so blessed through 
thee.       And have not I entwined in thy existence an 
olive-branch and a rose-bud, as in the garland which I dared to 
present thee?       Think of thyself, my beloved one; fear not to
leave me, I should die so blessed       so unutterably blessed, 
through thee.       

You may well imagine how these words thrilled through my 
bosom.       I told her I was not that which I was supposed to 
be; I was only a wealthy, but an infinitely-wretched man.       
There was, I said, a curse upon me, which should be the only 
secret between her and me; <a 
name="page63">p. 63for I had not
yet lost the hope of being delivered from it.       This was the 
poison of my existence: That I could have swept her away with me 
into the abyss; her, the sole light, the sole bliss, the sole 
spirit of my life.       Then she wept again that I was so 
unhappy.       She was so amiable, so full of love!       How 
blessed had she felt to have offered herself up in order to spare
me a single tear!
But she was far from rightly understanding my words: she 
sometimes fancied I was a prince pursued by a cruel proscription;
a high and devoted chief, whom her imagination loved to 
depicture, and to give to her beloved one all the bright hues of 
heroism.
Once I said to her,        Mina, on the last day of the coming
month, my doom may change and be decided; if that should not 
happen I must die, for I cannot make thee miserable.             
She wept, and her head sunk upon my bosom.              If thy 
doom should change, let me but know thou art happy; I have no 
claim upon thee       but shouldst thou become miserable, bind me
to thy misery, I will help thee to bear it.       
       Beloved maiden! withdraw       withdraw the rash, the 
foolish word which has escaped thy lips.       Dost thou know 
what is my misery? dost thou know what is my curse?       That 
thy p. 
64beloved       what he?       Dost thou see me shuddering
convulsively before thee, and concealing from 
thee                     She sunk sobbing at my feet, and renewed
her declaration with a solemn vow.
I declared to the now approaching forest-master, my 
determination to ask the hand of his daughter for the first day 
of the coming month.       I fixed that period, because in the 
meanwhile many an event might occur which would have great 
influence on my fortunes.       My love for his daughter could 
not but be unchangeable.
The good old man started back, as it were, while the words 
escaped from Count Peter       s lips.       He fell upon my 
neck, and then blushed that he had so far forgotten 
himself.       Then he began to doubt, to ponder, to inquire; he 
spoke of dowry, of security for the future for his beloved 
child.       I thanked him for reminding me of it.       I told 
him I wished to settle and live a life free from anxiety, in a 
neighbourhood where I appeared to be beloved.       I ordered him
to buy, in the name of his daughter, the finest estates that were
offered, and refer to me for the payment.       A father would 
surely best serve the lover of his child.       This gave him 
trouble enough, for some stranger or other always forestalled 
p. 
65him: but he bought for only the amount of about a 
million florins.
The truth is, this was a sort of innocent trick to get rid of 
him, which I had already once done before: for I must own he was 
rather tedious.       The good mother, on the contrary, was 
somewhat deaf, and not, like him, always jealous of the honour of
entertaining the noble Count.
The mother pressed forward.       The happy people crowded 
around me, entreating me to lengthen the evening among 
them.       I dared not linger a moment: the moon was rising 
above the twilight of evening: my time was come.
Next evening I returned again to the forest-garden.       I 
had thrown my broad mantle over my shoulders, my hat was slouched
over my eyes.       I advanced towards Mina; as she lifted up her
eyes and looked at me, an involuntary shudder came over 
her.       The frightful night in which I had shown myself 
shadowless in the moonlight, returned in all its brightness to my
mind.       It was indeed she!       Had she, too, recognized 
me?       She was silent and full of thought.       I felt the 
oppression of a nightmare on my breast.       I rose from my 
seat; she threw herself speechless on my bosom.       I left 
her.
p. 
66But now I often found her in tears; my soul grew darker 
and darker, while her parents seemed to revel in undisturbed 
joy.       The day so big with fate rolled onwards, heavy and 
dark, like a thunder-cloud.       Its eve had arrived, I could 
scarcely breathe.       I had been foresighted enough to fill 
some chests with gold.       I waited for midnight:       it 
tolled.
And there I sat, my eyes directed to the hand of the clock; 
the seconds, the minutes, as they tinkled, entered me like a 
dagger.       I rose up at every sound I heard.       The day 
began to dawn; the leaden hours crowded one on another; it was 
morning       evening       night.       The hands of the 
timepiece moved slowly on, and hope was departing.       It 
struck eleven, and nothing appeared.       The last minutes of 
the last hour vanished       still nothing appeared; the first 
stroke       the last stroke of twelve sounded.       I 
sank hopeless on my couch in ceaseless tears.       
To-morrow       shadowless for ever!       to-morrow I should 
solicit the hand of my beloved.       Towards morning a heavy 
sleep closed my eyes.




p. 
67CHAPTER V.
It was yet early, when I was awakened by the sound of voices 
violently disputing in my antechamber.       I listened: Bendel 
was forbidding access to my door.       Rascal swore loudly and 
deeply that he would take no orders from his fellow-servant, and 
insisted on rushing into my apartment.       The good Bendel 
warned him that if such language reached my ears, he might 
perchance lose a profitable place; but Rascal threatened to lay 
violent hands upon him, if he impeded his entrance any 
longer.
I had half dressed myself.       I angrily flung the door 
open, and called out to Rascal,        What dost want, thou 
scoundrel?              He retreated two paces, and answered with
perfect coldness,
       Humbly to request, may it please your lordship, for 
once to show me your shadow; the sun is shining so beautifully in
the court.       
I felt as if scathed by a thunderbolt, and it was long before 
I could utter a word:        How can a servant presume against 
his master that                     He interrupted me with 
provoking <span 
class="pagenum">p. 68calmness:        A servant may be a 
very honest man, and yet refuse to serve a shadowless 
master       I must have my discharge.              I tried 
another weapon.
       But, Rascal, my dear Rascal, who has put this wild 
notion into your head?       How can you 
imagine                     But he continued in the same tone, 
       There are people who assert you have no shadow; so, in a 
word, either show me your shadow, or give me my 
discharge!       
Bendel, pale and trembling, but more discreet than I, made me 
a sign to seek a resource in the silence-imposing gold       but 
it had lost its power; Rascal flung it at my feet:        I will 
take nothing from a shadowless being.              He turned his 
back upon me, put his hat on his head, and went slowly out of the
apartment whistling a tune.       I stood there like a 
petrifaction       looking after him, vacant and motionless.
Heavy and melancholy, with a deathlike feeling within me, I 
prepared to redeem my promise, and, like a criminal before his 
judges, to show myself in the forester       s garden.       I 
ascended to the dark arbour which had been called by my name, 
where an appointment had been made to meet me.       Mina       s
mother came forwards toward me, gay, and free from care.       
Mina was seated there, pale and lovely, as the <a 
name="page69">p. 69earliest snow
when it kisses the last autumnal flower, and soon dissolves into 
bitter drops.       The forest-master, with a written sheet in 
his hand, wandered in violent agitation from side to side, 
seemingly overcome with internal feelings, which painted his 
usually unvarying countenance with constantly changing paleness 
and scarlet.       He came towards me as I entered, and with 
broken accents requested to speak to me alone.       The path 
through which he invited me to follow him led to an open sunny 
part of the garden.       I seated myself down without uttering a
word; a long silence followed, which even our good mother dared 
not interrupt.
With irregular steps the forest-master paced the arbour 
backwards and forwards; he stood for a moment before me, looked 
into the paper which he held, and said with a most penetrating 
glance,        Count, and do you indeed know one Peter 
Schlemihl?              I was silent              a man of 
reputable character, and of great accomplishments.              
He waited for my answer.              And what if I were 
he?                     He!        added he vehemently, 
       who has in some way got rid of his 
shadow!                     Oh, my forebodings! my 
forebodings!        exclaimed Mina,        alas!       I knew 
long ago that he had no shadow!        and she flung herself into
her mother       s arms, who, alarmed, <a 
name="page70">p. 70pressed her 
convulsively to her bosom, reproaching me with having concealed 
such a fatal secret from her:       but she, like Arethusa, was 
bathed in a fountain of tears, which flowed abundantly at the 
sound of my voice, and at my approach tempestuously burst 
forth.
       And so,        cried the forest-master furiously, 
       your matchless impudence has sought to betray that poor 
girl and me       and you pretended to love her       her whom 
you have dragged to the abyss       see how she weeps, how she is
agonized!       O shame!       O sin!       
I was so completely confused that I answered incoherently: 
       After all,        twas but a shadow       nothing but a 
shadow       one can manage without it; and surely it is not 
worth making such a noise about.              But I felt so 
deeply the deception of my language, that I was silent before he 
deigned to give me an answer.       I added,        What a man 
has lost to-day he may find again to-morrow.       
He spoke angrily:        Explain to me, sir, explain how you 
got rid of your shadow.              I was compelled again to 
lie:        A vulgar fellow trod so clumsily upon my shadow, that
he tore a great hole in it; I sent it to be mended       gold can
do everything; I ought to have received it back 
yesterday.

71       Very well, sir, very well,        he 
replied.              You sue for my daughter       others do the
same; as her father I must take care of her.       I give you 
three days        respite, which you may employ in procuring a 
shadow.       Come to me after this, and if you have one that 
suits you, you will be welcome: but if not, on the fourth day, I 
must tell you, my daughter shall be the wife of 
another.              I attempted to address a word to Mina; but 
she clung, violently agitated, closer to her mother, who silently
beckoned to me that I should retire.       I slunk away as if the
world       s gates had closed behind me.
Escaped to Bendel       s affectionate guidance, I wandered 
with erring footsteps through fields and woods, sweat-drops of 
anguish fell from my brow; deep groans broke from my bosom; 
within me raged a wild frenzy.
I know not how long it had lasted, when on a sunny heath I 
found myself held by the sleeve       I stood still, and looked 
around me.       It was the grey-coated stranger; he seemed to 
have followed me till he was out of breath.       He instantly 
began:
       I had announced myself for to-day; you have hardly been
able to wait so long       but all is well       you will take 
good counsel: exchange <span 
class="pagenum">p. 72your shadow again; it only waits your
commands, and then turn back.       You will be welcome in the 
forester       s garden; it was but a jest.       Rascal, who has
betrayed you, and who is a suitor to your betrothed, I will 
dispose of       the fellow is ripe.       




I stood there still, as if I were 
asleep              Announced for to-day?              I reckoned
the time over again; it was so.       I had erred in my 
calculations.       I put my right hand on the bag in my bosom; 
he discovered my meaning, and drew back two paces.
       No, Sir Count, that is in good hands; that you may 
retain.              I looked on him with staring and inquiring 
eyes.       He spoke:        May I ask for a trifling 
memento?       Be so good as to sign this note.              The 
following words were on the parchment he held:
       I hereby promise to deliver over my soul to
the bearer after its natural separation from my body.       

I looked with dumb astonishment, now on the grey unknown, and 
now on the writing.       In the mean time he had dipped a new 
pen in a drop of my blood, which was flowing from a scratch made 
by a thorn in my hand.       He handed the pen to me.
       Who are you, then?        I at last inquired.
p. 
73       What does that matter?        he answered.       
       Don       t you see what I am?       a poor devil; a sort 
of philosopher or alchemist, who receives spare thanks for great 
favours he confers on his friends; one who has no enjoyment in 
this world, except a little experimentializing:       but 
sign, I pray       ay, just there on the right, Peter 
Schlemihl.       
I shook my head.              Forgive me, sir, for I will not 
sign.                     Not!        replied he, with seeming 
surprise,        why not?       
              Tis an affair that requires some 
consideration       to add my soul to my shadow in the 
bargain.                     Oh, oh!        he exclaimed, 
       consideration!        and burst into a loud laugh.       
       May I then be allowed to ask, what sort of a thing is your
soul?       Have you ever seen it?       Do you know what will 
become of it when you are once departed?       Rejoice that you 
have found somebody to take notice of it; to buy, even during 
your lifetime, the reversion of this X, this galvanic power, this
polarising influence, or whatever the silly trifle may turn out 
to be; to pay for it with your bodily shadow, with something 
really substantial; the hand of your mistress, the fulfilment of 
your prayers.       Or will you rather deliver over the sweet 
maiden to that contemptible scoundrel, Mr. Rascal?       No, no! 
p. 
74look to that with your own eyes.       Come hither; I 
will lend you the wishing-cap too, (he drew something from his 
pocket), and we will have a ramble unseen through the 
forest-garden.       
I must confess I was sadly ashamed to be thus laughed at by 
this fellow.       I hated him from the bottom of my soul; and I 
believe this personal antipathy prevented me, more than my 
principles, from giving the required signature for my shadow, 
necessary as it was to me.       The thought was unbearable, that
I should undertake such a walk in his company.       This 
sneaking scoundrel, this scornful, irritating imp, placing 
himself betwixt me and my beloved, sporting with two bleeding 
hearts, roused my deepest feelings.       I looked on what had 
past as ordained, and considered my misery as 
irretrievable.       I turned upon the man and said:
       Sir, I sold you my shadow for this most estimable bag 
of yours: I have repented it enough; if the bargain can be 
annulled, in the name of                     He shook his 
head       looked at me with a dark frown.       I began again: 
       I will sell you nothing more of my possessions, though you
may offer as high a price as for my shadow; and I will sign 
nothing.       Hence you may conclude that the metamorphosis to 
which you invite me would perhaps be more agreeable to <!-- page 
75-->p. 75you 
than to me.       Forgive me, but it cannot be otherwise; let us 
part.       
       I am sorry, Mr. Schlemihl, that you so capriciously 
push away the favours which are presented to you; but I may be 
more fortunate another time.       Farewell, till our speedy 
meeting!       By the way, you will allow me to mention, that I 
do not by any means permit my purchases to get mouldy; I hold 
them in special regard, and take the best possible care of 
them.              With this he took my shadow out of his pocket,
and with a dexterous fling it was unrolled and spread out on the 
heath on the sunny side of his feet, so that he stood between the
two attendant shadows, mine and his, and walked away; mine seemed
to belong to him as much as his own; it accommodated itself to 
all his movements and all his necessities.
When I saw my poor shadow again, after so long a separation, 
and found it applied to such base uses, at a moment when for its 
sake I was suffering nameless anguish, my heart broke within me, 
and I began to weep most bitterly.       The hated one walked 
proudly on with his spoil, and unblushingly renewed his 
proposals.
       You may have it              tis but a stroke of the 
pen; you will save, too, your poor unhappy Mina from the claws of
the vagabond; save her <span 
class="pagenum">p. 76for the arms of the most honourable 
Count.              Tis but a stroke of the pen, I 
say.              Tears broke forth with new violence; but I 
turned away, and beckoned him to be gone.
Bendel, who had followed my steps to the present spot, 
approached me full of sadness at this instant.       The 
kind-hearted fellow perceived me weeping, and observed my shadow,
which he could not mistake, attached to the figure of the 
extraordinary, grey, unknown one, and he endeavoured by force to 
put me in possession of my property; but not being able to lay 
firm hold on this subtle thing, he ordered the old man, in a 
peremptory tone, to abandon what did not belong to him.       He,
for a reply, turned his back upon my well-meaning servant, and 
marched away.       Bendel followed him closely, and lifting up 
the stout black-thorn cudgel which he carried, required the man 
to give up the shadow, enforcing the command with the strength of
his nervous arm; but the man, accustomed perhaps to such 
encounters, bowed his head, raised his shoulders, and walked 
silently and calmly over the heath, accompanied by my shadow and 
my faithful man.       For a long time I heard the dull sound 
echoed over the waste.       It was lost at last in the 
distance.       I stood alone with my misery as before.
p. 
77CHAPTER VI.
Thus left behind on the dreary heath, I gave vent to countless
tears, which seemed to lighten my bosom of its intolerable 
weight.       But I saw no bounds, no outlet, no term to my 
terrible misery, and with wild impatience I sucked in the poison 
which the mysterious being had poured into my wounds.       When 
I recalled the image of Mina, her soft and lovely form appeared 
pale and weeping before me, as I had seen her in my hour of 
ignominy; and the shade of Rascal impudently and contumaciously 
seemed to step between us.       I veiled my face, I fled across 
the waste; but the ghastly vision still pursued me; I 
ran       it was close to me.       I sank breathless to the 
ground, and watered it with renewed springs of tears.
And all about a shadow! a shadow which a stroke of the pen 
would have restored to me!       I mused again on the strange 
proposal and my refusal.       All was dark and desolate within 
me; I had neither argument nor reason left.
The day rolled by.       I calmed my hunger with <!-- page 
78-->p. 78wild 
fruits; my thirst with the nearest mountain stream.       Night 
approached; I stretched myself under a tree.       The damp dawn 
awaked me from a heavy sleep, in which I had heard myself groan, 
as if struggling with death.       Bendel had surely lost my 
traces, and I rejoiced to think so.       I determined to return 
no more among men, from whom I fled like the shy beasts of the 
mountain.       Thus I existed through three weary days.
On the morning of the fourth I found myself on a shady plain, 
where the sun was shining brightly.       I sat down there on the
fragment of rock in its beam, for I enjoyed to bask again in its 
long-forbidden glance.       I nourished my heart with its own 
despair.       But I was alarmed by a gentle rustling.       I 
looked eagerly round me preparing to fly       I saw no one; but 
there passed by on the sunny sand a man       s shadow not unlike
my own, wandering about alone, and which appeared straying from 
its owner.
A mighty impulse was roused within me.       Shadow, thought 
I, art thou seeking thy master.       I will be he; and I sprang 
forward to possess myself of it.       I imagined that if I were 
lucky enough to get into its track, I could so arrange that its 
feet should just meet mine; it would even attach and accommodate 
itself to me.




p. 
79The shadow on my moving fled before me, and I was 
compelled to begin an active chase after the unsubstantial 
wanderer.       The eager desire to be released from the 
perplexities in which I stood armed me with unusual 
strength.       It fled to a distant wood, in whose obscurity it 
necessarily would have been immediately lost.       I saw 
it       a terror pierced my heart, kindled my burning desire, 
and gave wings to my feet.       I gained on the shadow, 
approached it nearer and nearer,       I was within reach of 
it.       It stopped suddenly and turned round towards me; like 
the lion pouncing on its prey, I sprang forward upon it with a 
mighty effort to take possession.       I felt most unexpectedly 
that I had dashed against something which made a bodily 
resistance       I received from an unseen power the most violent
thrust which a human being ever felt.       The working of terror
was acting dreadfully within me; its effect was to close my arms 
as in a spasm, to seize on what stood unseen before me.       I 
staggered onwards, and fell prostrate on the ground; beneath me 
on his back was a man whom I held fast, and who now was 
visible.
The whole affair was now naturally explained.       The man 
must have possessed the viewless charm which makes the possessor 
but not his <span 
class="pagenum">p. 80shadow, invisible.       He first 
held it, and afterwards had thrown it away.       I looked round,
and immediately discovered the shadow of the invisible 
charm.       I leaped up and sprang towards it, and did not miss 
at last the valuable spoil; unseen, and shadowless, I held the 
charm in my hand.
The man rose up speedily; he looked round after his fortunate 
subduer, not being able to discover in the broad sunny plain 
either him or his shadow, which he sought with the greatest 
anxiety: for he had no reason to suspect, and no time to observe,
that I was a shadowless being.       As soon as he discovered 
that every trace was vanished, he raised his hands against 
himself in the wildest despair, and tore his hair.       But this
newly-acquired treasure gave me the means and the disposition to 
mingle again among my fellow-men.       No pretext was wanting 
for palliating to my own mind this despicable robbery; or, 
rather, it wanted no such pretext.       With a view of ridding 
myself of any internal reproaches, I hurried away, not even 
looking back on the unfortunate victim, whose agonized tones I 
heard long repeated after me.       So, at least, at that time I 
looked upon the circumstances of that event.
I longed to go to the forest-garden, in order <!-- page 
81-->p. 81to 
inform myself of the truth of what the hated one had announced to
me; but I knew not where I was; and in order to inform myself as 
to the neighbourhood, I mounted the nearest hill, and saw from 
its brow the tower of the forest-garden lying at my feet.       
My heart beat with agitation, and tears, very different from 
those I had before shed, burst into my eyes.       I was to see 
her again.       An anxious, longing desire hurried my steps down
the straightest path.       A crowd of peasants I passed unseen 
going from town; they were talking of me and of Rascal, and of 
the forester.       I would listen to nothing; I hastened by.
I walked into the garden, my bosom trembling with the alarm of
expectation.       A laugh approached me.       I shook; looked 
eagerly around me, but could perceive nobody.       I moved 
farther forward, and a noise as of the pacing of human feet 
seemed near me.       Still I could see nothing       I thought 
my ears were deceived; but it was early, nobody was in Count 
Peter       s arbour       the garden was empty.       I rambled 
over the familiar paths, until I came near to the mansion.       
I heard the same sound more distinctly.       I sat down with a 
sorrowful heart upon a bank immediately opposite the front door, 
in a sunny spot.       It appeared to me as if I heard the 
invisible <span 
class="pagenum">p. 82imp laughing insultingly.       The 
key was turned in the door, which opened, and the forest-master 
walked out with papers in his hand.       I felt something like a
mist around my eyes       I looked round       and, oh horrible! 
the man in the grey coat was sitting close to me, looking on me 
with a satanic smile.       He had drawn his wishing cap over my 
head.       At his feet my shadow and his own lay peacefully one 
against the other; he was playing carelessly with the well-known 
parchment, which he held in his hand; and while the forest-master
was walking backwards and forwards in the shade of the arbour, he
bent himself familiarly to my ear, and whispered to me these 
words:       
       Now, then, you have at last accepted my offer, and so 
we set two heads under one cap.       Very good! very good!      
But pray give me my charm again       you do not want it any 
more, and are too honourable a man to keep what does not belong 
to you: no thanks       I assure you I lent it to you from my 
heart.              He took it gently from my hand, put it into 
his pocket, laughed insultingly at me, and so loudly, that the 
forest-master looked round attracted by the noise.       I sat 
there as if I had been petrified.
       You must agree,        he rejoined,        that such a 
p. 
83cap is much more convenient.       It does not cover its
possessor alone, but his shadow also, and as many people besides 
as he likes to have with him.       Look, now, to-day I get two 
of ye.              He laughed again.              You must know,
Schlemihl, that what is not done by fair means at first, may be 
enforced at last; I still thought you would have bought the 
trifle.       Take back your bride (there is yet time), and send 
Rascal to swing on the gallows; that is an easy matter while we 
have a rope at hand.       Hearken, I give you the cap into the 
bargain.       
The mother came forth, and this conversation followed.       
       What is my Mina 
doing?                     Weeping.                     Simple 
child! but can it not be altered?                     No, 
indeed.                     But to give her so soon to 
another       O husband! you are cruel to your own 
child!                     Mother! you don       t see 
clearly.       Even before she has wept out her childish tears, 
when she finds herself the wife of a rich and noble man, she will
be consoled for her sorrows, as if awakened from a dream.       
She will thank Heaven and us; and that you will 
see.                     God grant it!                     She 
already possesses a pretty handsome dowry; but after the noise 
made by that unfortunate adventurer, do you believe that so 
brilliant a proposal as Mr. Rascal       s will soon or easily be
found?       Do <span 
class="pagenum">p. 84you know what wealth he 
possesses?       He has six million florins in landed property in
this country paid for in cash, free from all incumbrances.       
I have the writings in hand.       It was he who forestalled me 
always in the best purchases.       Besides this, he has in his 
portfolio bills of exchange on Mr. Thomas Jones for above three 
millions and a half of florins.                     He must have 
pilfered at a pretty rate.                     That       s all 
nonsense.       He has hoarded wisely, where others foolishly 
squandered.                     But a man who has worn a 
livery!                     Folly! he has an irreproachable 
shadow!                     You are right, but              
The man in the great coat laughed and looked full in my 
face.       The door opened, and Mina came out; she was 
supporting herself on her maid       s arm; silent tears were 
flowing over her pale and lovely cheeks.       She sat down in a 
chair placed for her under the lime-trees, and her father seated 
himself beside her.       He gently seized her hand, and while 
she wept still more bitterly, addressed her in the gentlest 
accents.
       Thou art my best, my dearest child; thou wilt be 
prudent too; thou wilt not grieve thy old father, who thinks only
of making thee happy.       I well understand, my sweet girl, 
that p.
85this has sadly shaken thee; thou hast wonderfully 
escaped from misery.       Before the shameless cheat was 
unveiled, thou lovedst that unworthy one most 
affectionately.       I know it, Mina, but I do not reproach 
thee.       I, too, loved him, while I deemed him to be a rich 
and noble man.       But thou hast seen in what it ended.       
The veriest vagabond has his own shadow; and shall my beloved, my
only daughter, be married to       Oh, no! thou thinkest of him 
no more.       Listen, my Mina: a lover addresses thee, who does 
not dread the sun; an honourable man, who is no Count indeed, but
who possesses ten millions, ten times more than thou hast ever 
possessed; a man who will make my beloved child happy.       Do 
not oppose me; make no reply; be my good, obedient 
daughter.       Let thy affectionate father care for thee, and 
dry thy tears.       Promise me to give thy hand to Mr. Rascal; 
say, wilt thou promise me?       
She answered with a dying voice,        I have no farther will
nor wish on earth; let my father       s will be 
accomplished!              On this Mr. Rascal was announced, and 
daringly joined the circle.       Mina lay in a swoon.       My 
hated evil genius fixed his eyes angrily on me, and whispered in 
these rapid words,        Can you bear <a 
name="page86">p. 86that 
too?       What runs in your veins instead of blood?             
With a swift motion he made a slight wound in my hand       blood
gushed forth: he cried,        Red blood, truly! 
sign.              The parchment and the pen were in my hand.
p. 
87CHAPTER VII.
I shall expose myself, dear Chamisso, to your criticism, and 
not seek to elude it.       I have long visited myself with the 
heaviest judgment, for I have fed the devouring worm in my 
heart.       This terrible moment of my existence is 
everlastingly present to my soul; and I can contemplate it only 
in a doubting glance, with humility and contrition.       My 
friend, he who carelessly takes a step out of the straight path, 
is imperceptibly impelled into another course, in which he will 
be deluded farther and farther astray.       For him in vain the 
pole-star twinkles in the heavens; there is no choice for him; he
must slide down the declivity, and offer himself up to 
Nemesis.       After the false and precipitate step which had 
brought down the curse upon me, I had daringly thrust myself upon
the fate of another being.       What now remained, but where I 
had sowed perdition, and prompt salvation was urgent       again 
blindly to rush forward to save?       for the last knell had 
tolled.       Do not think so basely of me, my Chamisso, as <!-- 
page 88-->p. 
88to imagine that I should have thought any price too 
dear, or should have been more sparing with anything I possessed 
than with my gold?       No! but my soul was filled with 
unconquerable hatred towards this mysterious sneaker in crooked 
paths.       Perhaps I might be unjust to him, yet my mind 
revolted against all communication with him.       But here, as 
often in my life, and generally in the history of the world, an 
accident rather than an intention, determined the issue.       
Afterwards I became reconciled to myself.       I learnt, in the 
first place, to respect necessity, and those accidents which are 
yet more the result of necessity than any will of our own.       
Then was I also taught to obey this necessity, as a wise 
arrangement of Providence, which sets all this machinery in 
action, in which we only co-operate by moving and setting other 
wheels in motion.       What must be, will happen; what should 
have been, was; and not without the intervention of that 
Providence, which I at last learnt to reverence in my fate, and 
in the fate of her who controlled mine.
I know not if I should ascribe it to the strain of my soul 
under the pressure of such mighty emotions, or to the exhaustion 
of my physical strength, weakened by the unwonted abstinence <!--
page 89-->p. 
89of the days gone by, or to that fatal agitation which 
the approach of this grey adversary produced through my whole 
frame; but certain it is, that while preparing to sign, I fell 
into a deep swoon, and lay a long time as in the arms of 
death.
On coming to my recollection, the first tones that reached my 
ears were the stamping of feet and cursing.       I opened my 
eyes; it was dark; my hated companion was there holding me, but 
scolding thus:        Now, is not that behaving like a silly old 
woman?       Let the gentleman rise up       conclude the 
business       as he intended       or, perhaps he has other 
thoughts       would like still to weep.              With 
difficulty I raised myself from the ground where I lay, and 
looked silently around me.       The evening was advanced; 
festive music broke from the brightly-lighted forest-house, and 
groups of company were scattered over the garden walks.       
Some drew near who were engaged in conversation, and seated 
themselves on the benches.       They spoke of the nuptials of 
the daughter of the house with the rich Mr. Rascal       they had
taken place in the morning       all       all was over.
I struck away with my hand from my head the wishing-cap of the
instantly-vanishing unknown one, and fled in silence to conceal 
myself <span 
class="pagenum">p. 90in the deepest darkness of the wood, 
hurrying to the garden gate before Count Peter       s 
arbour.       But my evil genius accompanied me unseen, pursuing 
me with bitter words.              This, then, is the reward one 
is to get for the trouble of taking care, through the live-long 
day, of the nervous gentleman!       And I am then to be fooled 
at last?       Very well, very well, Mr. Wronghead: fly from me, 
but we are inseparable.       You have my gold, and I your 
shadow; they leave no rest to either.       Did anybody ever hear
of a shadow abandoning its master?       Yours draws me after 
you, till you condescend to take it again, and I get rid of 
it.       What you have sold, or neglected to do, of your own 
free-will, that will you be compelled to repair with repugnance 
and weariness; man cannot oppose his destiny.              He 
continued to talk in the same tone,       I fled from him in 
vain       he was always behind me       ever present       and 
speaking sneeringly of gold and shadow.       I could not repose 
on a single thought.
Through untrodden, vacant streets, I hastened to my 
abode.       I stood before it       looked up       and hardly 
recognized it.       Behind the closed windows no light was 
burning; the doors were shut       no servants appeared to be 
moving.       He stood behind me, and laughed <a 
name="page91">p. 91aloud.       
       Ay, ay! but your Bendel is certainly at home; he was sent 
hither so thoroughly exhausted, that no doubt he has carefully 
kept house.              He laughed again              He will 
have some stories to amuse you       take courage.       Good 
night for to-day, till an early interview.       
I rang again, and a light appeared.       Bendel asked from 
within,        who is there?              When he heard my voice,
the poor fellow could scarcely contain his joy; the door flew 
open, and we lay weeping in each other       s arms.       He was
greatly changed       weak and ill.       My hair had become 
wholly grey.
He led me through the vacant chambers to an inner apartment, 
which remained furnished.       He fetched meat and 
drink       we sat down       he again began to weep; he then 
told me that he had lately beaten the grey-clad meagre man, whom 
he had met with my shadow, so lustily and so long, that he lost 
all trace of me, and had sunk exhausted to the earth; that 
afterwards, not being able to discover me, he had returned home, 
and that the mob, excited by Rascal, had raised a tumult, broken 
the windows of the house, and given full reins to their love of 
destruction.       Thus they had rewarded their 
benefactors.       One after another my servants had fled.       
The police of the place had ordered <a 
name="page92">p. 92me to leave 
the town as a suspicious person, allowing me a delay of only 
four-and-twenty hours to quit their territory.       He had a 
great deal to add to what I already knew of Rascal       s wealth
and espousals.       This scoundrel, who had originated all the 
proceedings against me, must have possessed my secret from the 
beginning.       It seemed that, attracted by the gold, he had 
forced himself upon me, and had procured a key for that 
treasure-chest where he laid the foundation of his fortune, which
he now seemed determined to enjoy.
Bendel told me all with abundant tears, and wept anew for joy 
at seeing me again, and again possessing me: and he rejoiced 
that, after all his fears as to what misfortune might have 
brought me, he found me bearing everything with calmness and 
fortitude; for such was the form in which despair reigned over 
me, while I saw gigantic and unchangeable misery before me.      
I had wept away all my tears; grief could force out no other 
accent of distress from my bosom.       I raised against it, 
coldly and unconcernedly, my uncovered head.
       Bendel,        said I,        you know my fate.       
Not without certain guilt does the heavy penalty fall on 
me.       You, innocent being as you are, shall no longer bind 
your destiny to mine, I will no <a 
name="page93">p. 93longer let it
be so.       To-night I will hasten away.       Saddle me my 
horse       I ride alone       you must remain       I require 
it.       Some chests of gold must yet be here.       They are 
now yours.       I shall wander restlessly through the world; but
if a happier day should dawn, and bliss should again smile upon 
me, I will faithfully think of you; for on your faithful bosom I 
have wept in many a weary, wretched, sorrowful hour.       
The honest fellow obeyed with a broken heart this last command
of his master.       It agonized his soul; but I was deaf to his 
representations and entreaties, and blind to his tears.       He 
brought the horse to me, I pressed him while he wept against my 
breast, sprang into the saddle, and pursued my way under the 
mantle of night from the grave of my existence; indifferent as to
the direction my horse might take.       On the earth I had no 
goal       no wish       no hope.

94CHAPTER VIII.
A foot passenger soon joined me, and, after walking some time 
by my horse       s side, begged me, as we were bound the same 
way, to be allowed to throw the cloak which he carried on the 
crupper; I quietly allowed him to do so.       He thanked me with
a graceful address for this trifling service, praised my horse, 
and thence took the opportunity of lauding the happiness and the 
influence of the wealthy.       He went on I know not how, in a 
sort of soliloquy, for I was only a hearer.
He unfolded his views of life and the world, and soon 
introduced metaphysics, from whence the word was to emanate which
should solve all mysteries.       He developed his theme with 
great distinctness, and led forward to its deductions.
You know very well that I have often confessed, since I drove 
through the school of philosophy, that I do not consider myself 
as by any means calculated for philosophical speculations, and 
that I have altogether renounced that branch of <a
name="page95">p. 95study.       
From that time I have let many things be settled as they could, 
renounced much which I might have understood or learnt, and, 
following your counsels by trusting to my innate senses, that 
voice of the heart, I have gone forward in my own road as far as 
I was able.       This rhetorician appeared to me to build his 
firmly-cemented edifice with great ability.       It seemed to 
bear itself on its firm and solid foundation, and stood, as it 
were, on its own absolute necessity.       Then I missed in the 
edifice what I particularly sought; and it was to me merely a 
piece of art, whose completeness and decorations served only to 
delight the eye; but I listened willingly to the eloquent man, 
who seemed to transfer to himself my observations on my own 
sorrows; and I should have cheerfully surrendered myself to him, 
if he would have taken possession of my soul as well as of my 
understanding.
In the mean while time passed on, and morning dawn had 
imperceptibly stolen over the heaven.       I trembled as I 
looked around, and saw the magnificent colours blending in the 
east, and heralding the ascending sun; and at that hour, when the
shadows stretch themselves out in all their extension, no 
shelter, no protection was to be discovered       and I was not 
alone!       I looked <span 
class="pagenum">p. 96upon my companion, and again I 
trembled: it was even the man in the grey coat.
He smiled at my alarms, and without allowing me to utter a 
word, began:        Let us then, as is the custom of the world, 
unite our different advantages for a while! we have always time 
to separate.       The road along-side the mountain, if you have 
not already thought about it, is the only one which you can 
prudently take.       You dare not descend into the valley; and 
over the hill you will hardly think of returning as it would lead
you whence you came; and the road in which you are is just 
mine.       I see the uprising sun makes you look pale; I will 
lend you your shadow while we remain together, and this may 
induce you to bear my being near to you.       Your Bendel is no 
longer with you, but I will do you good service.       You do not
love me: I am sorry for it; but you may make use of me 
notwithstanding.       The devil is not so black as he is 
represented.       Yesterday, you vexed me,        tis true, but 
I will bear you no grudge to-day.       I have shortened your way
thus far, as you must yourself confess; now take your shadow on 
trial again.       
The sun had arisen; travellers were approaching us on the 
road, and in spite of an internal repugnance, I accepted his 
offer.       He smiled, <span
class="pagenum">p. 97and let my shadow fall on the ground;
it took its station upon that of my horse, and cheerfully moved 
forward.       My mind was in a strange mood.       I rode by a 
body of country people, who were respectfully making room with 
their heads uncovered as for a wealthy-looking man.       I rode 
farther, and looked aside from my horse with eager eyes and 
beating heart, on what was once my shadow; but which I had now 
borrowed from a stranger, ay, from an enemy.
He came on carelessly by my side, and whistled a tune       he
on foot, I on horseback.       A dizziness seized me, the 
temptation was too great; I hastily turned the reins, drove both 
spurs into the horse, and thus went off at full speed through a 
cross road.       I could not elope with the shadow, it slipped 
away when the horse started, and waited on the road for its 
lawful owner.       I was obliged to turn round, ashamed; the man
in the grey coat, as he unconcernedly finished his tune, began to
laugh at me, and fixing the shadow again in its place, informed 
me it would only stick to me, and remain with me, when I had 
properly and lawfully become possessed of it.              I hold
you fast,        he cried,        fast attached to the shadow; 
you cannot escape from me.       A wealthy man like you may want 
a shadow: likely enough       and <a 
name="page98">p. 98you are only 
to blame for not having earlier looked into the 
matter.       
I continued my journey on the same road as before.       I 
possessed all the comforts of life, and all its luxuries.       I
could move about freely and easily; and I possessed a shadow too,
though but a borrowed one, and I imposed everywhere that 
reverence which wealth commands; but death was at my heart.      
My marvellous conductor, who represented himself to be the 
unworthy slave of the richest man in the world, had extraordinary
readiness as a servant, and was exceedingly dexterous and clever,
the very model of a valet for a wealthy gentleman; but he never 
separated himself from my side, and incessantly plagued me, 
exhibiting the greatest assurance in order that I should conclude
the bargain with him respecting the shadow, if it were only to 
get rid of him.       He was as troublesome as hateful to me; I 
always stood in awe of him.       I had made myself dependent on 
him; I was still in his power, and he had again driven me into 
the vanities of the world which I had abandoned: I was compelled 
to allow to his eloquence full mastery over me, and almost felt 
he was in the right.       A wealthy man ought to have a shadow 
in the world; and so long as I wished to occupy that station 
which <span 
class="pagenum">p. 99he had induced me to fill, there was 
only one outlet for me.       But on this I 
determined       having sacrificed my love, and made my existence
a curse, I would not transfer my soul to this being       no, not
for all the shadows in the world; but I knew not how it would 
end.
One day we were sitting before a cave, which the travellers 
who had to cross the mountain were accustomed to visit.       
There was heard the noise of subterraneous streams roaring from 
unmeasurable deeps; and the stone that was thrown into the abyss 
seemed in its echoing fall to find no bottom.       He depicted 
to me, as he had often done, with a luxuriant fancy, and in the 
glowing charms of the brightest colouring, careful and detailed 
pictures of the brilliant figure I might make in the world by 
means of my purse, if I had only my shadow again in my 
possession.       My elbows were supported on my knees while I 
covered my face with my hands, listening to the evil one, my 
heart twice rent between temptation and my own earnest 
will.       Such internal discord I could no longer endure, and 
the decisive struggle began.
       You seem to forget, good sir, that I have allowed you 
to remain in my company only on certain conditions, and that I 
retained for myself my unrestrained 
liberty.                     If you order me, I <!-- page 
100-->p. 
100shall move off:        the threat was one to which he 
was accustomed.       I ceased: he sat himself quietly down, and 
began to roll up my shadow.       I grew pale, but I stood dumb 
while he did so.       There was a long silence.       He thus 
broke it:
       You cannot endure me, sir! you hate me       I know it:
but why do you hate me?       Is it because, when you attacked me
on the highway, you attempted to steal my charm by force? or is 
it because you endeavoured fraudulently to get possessed of my 
property, the shadow, which had been confided to your simple 
honour?       For myself, I do not hate you for that; it is quite
natural you should seek to turn your advantages, your cunning, 
your strength to good account.       That you have the most rigid
principles, and are honesty itself, is a hobby-horse belief of 
your own, to which I can have no objection.       My notions are 
not so strict as yours: I only act according to your 
notions.       But did I ever attempt to strangle you in order to
possess your valuable soul, to which I really have a great 
liking?       Have I, for the sake of my bartered purse, let 
loose a servant upon you, and endeavoured to run away with 
it?              I could answer nothing to all this,       and he
continued.              Well then, sir, well!       You cannot 
endure me, I <span 
class="pagenum">p. 101understand it, and am not displeased
with you for that.       It is clear we must part, and you really
are become very tedious to me; but to get rid of my perplexing 
presence altogether for the future, I will give you a piece of 
advice       buy the thing of me!              I held out the 
purse to him.              At the 
price?                     No!              I sighed deeply, and 
began again.              Well, then, I insist upon it, we must 
part,       do not stop up my way any longer in a world which is 
wide enough for both of us.              He smiled, and 
replied:              I go, sir; but I will first instruct you 
how to summon me, when you wish for the presence of your most 
humble slave: you need only shake your purse, that its 
exhaustless pieces may tinkle, and the sound will draw me 
instantly to you.       Everybody in this world thinks of his own
interests; you see I also am attending to yours       for I give 
you spontaneously a new power.       Excellent purse! and even if
the moths had devoured your shadow, there would be a strong bond 
of union between us.       But enough       you possess me while 
you possess my gold; however distant, command your 
servant       you know I am always ready to do honour to my 
friends, and that I have for the wealthy an especial regard; that
you yourself have seen       but as for your shadow, sir, <!-- 
page 102-->p. 
102allow me to assure you, your shadow will never be yours
but on one condition.       
Visions of old time floated in my soul.       I inquired 
hastily:        Did Mr. Jones give you his 
signature?              He smiled:        With so good a friend 
it was not necessary.                     Where is 
he       where?       By Heavens I will know!              He put
his hand slowly into his pocket, and drew out by the hair the 
pale and ghastly form of Thomas Jones.       Its blue and deadly 
lips trembled with the dreadful words:        Justo judicio 
Dei judicatus sum; justo judicio Dei condemnatus 
sum.              I was horror-struck       I dashed the 
clinking purse hastily into the abyss, and uttered these last 
words,        I conjure thee, in the name of God, monster, 
begone, and never again appear before these eyes.              He
rose up with a gloomy frown, and vanished instantaneously behind 
the dark masses of rock which surrounded that wild and savage 
place.
<span 
class="pagenum">p. 103CHAPTER IX.
I sat there shadowless and penniless: but a heavy weight had 
been removed from my bosom, and I was calm.       Had I not lost 
my love, or had that loss left me free from self-reproach, I 
believe I might have been happy; but I knew not what steps I 
should take.       I searched my pockets, and found that a few 
pieces of gold remained to me; I counted them smilingly.       I 
had left my horse at the inn below.       I was ashamed to return
there, at least till the setting of the sun       and the sun was
high in the heavens.       I laid myself down in the shade of a 
neighbouring tree, and fell quietly asleep.
The sweetest images danced cheerfully around me in my 
delightful dreams.       Mina, crowned with a garland of flowers,
hovered over me, and cheered me with an affectionate smile.      
The noble Bendel was there, too, weaving a flowery wreath, and 
approaching me with a friendly greeting.       Many others also 
were there, and among them methought I saw even thee, Chamisso, 
in the distant crowd.       A bright <a 
name="page104">p. 104light 
shone, but there were no shadows; and, what was more singular, 
all appeared happy       flowers and songs, and love and joy, 
under groves of palms.       I could hardly realize, understand, 
or point out the flitting, swiftly dispersed, and lovely forms; 
but I enjoyed such visions, I would fain not awake       but I 
awoke,       though I kept my eyes closed, that the vanishing 
dreams might play a little longer round my soul.
But I opened my eyes at last       the sun was in the heavens,
but in the east; I had slept through the night.       I took this
for a sign that I ought not to return to the inn.       I 
willingly abandoned that which I had so lately left there, and 
determined to take on foot a by-road, which led through the 
forest-girded base of the hill, leaving it to fate to determine 
what might be my lot.       I looked not back; I thought not even
of applying to Bendel, whom I had left in wealth behind me, which
I might so easily have done.       I began to consider what new 
character I should assume in the world.       My appearance was 
very unpretending: I wore an old black coat, which I had formerly
worn in Berlin, and which, I know not how, I had taken for this 
journey.       I had only a travelling-cap on my head, and a pair
of worn-out boots on my feet.       I rose up, <a
name="page105">p. 105cut a 
knobbed stick from the spot as a sort of memento, and began my 
wanderings.
I overtook in the wood an old peasant, who greeted me with 
great kindness, and with whom I entered into conversation.       
I first inquired, like a curious traveller, about the road, then 
about the neighbourhood and its inhabitants, the productions of 
the mountain, and such matters.       He answered my inquiries 
talkatively and sensibly.       We came to the bed of a 
mountain-stream, which had spread its devastations over a wide 
part of the forest.       I shuddered inwardly before the wide 
sunny place, and let the countryman precede me.       He however 
stood still in the middle of this frightful spot, and turned 
round towards me, in order to give me the history of the 
overflow.       He soon observed what was wanting to me, and 
stopped in the middle of his narrative to say:        But how is 
this       the gentleman has got no shadow!              
       Alas! alas!        I replied with a sigh,        I had a 
long and dreadful illness, and lost my hair, my nails, and my 
shadow!       Look, father, at my time of life, my hair, which 
has grown again, quite white, my nails sadly short, and my shadow
is not yet springing forth.                     Ay! ay,        
said the old man, shaking his head,        no shadow! 
that       s odd       the gentleman must have had a sad 
illness!              <span
class="pagenum">p. 106But he did not go on with his story,
and at the next cross path he glided away from, me without saying
a word.       Bitter tears trembled again on my cheeks       all 
my serenity was gone.
With a heavy heart I moved forwards, and sought the society of
man no longer.       I concealed myself in the thickest of the 
forest, and was often obliged to wait for hours in order to get 
over sunny spots, even where no human eye forbade my progress; in
the evening I sought a retreat in the villages.       At last I 
bent my course towards a mine in the mountain, where I hoped to 
find employment under ground; for besides that my situation 
required me even to procure my daily bread, I clearly perceived 
that nothing but the most laborious toil would be any protection 
from my convulsive thoughts.
A couple of rainy days helped me far on my way, but at the 
cost of my boots, whose soles were made to suit Count Peter, and 
not a running footman: I soon walked on my naked feet, and was 
obliged to procure another pair of boots.       The next morning 
I attended earnestly to this affair in a village, where a fair 
was held, and where old and new boots were exposed in a shop for 
sale.       I selected and bargained for a long time.       I was
obliged to abandon a new <a 
name="page107">p. 107pair which 
I wished to possess       I was frightened by the extravagant 
price, and satisfied myself, therefore, with old ones, which were
yet firm and strong, and which the fair and light-haired shop-boy
handed to me for my ready cash with a smile, while he wished me a
prosperous journey.       I put them on immediately, and went 
away through a door which lay to the north.
I was lost in my own thoughts, and hardly observed where I put
my foot       for I was still planning about the mine, whither I 
hoped to arrive by the evening, and hardly knew how I should 
manage to introduce myself there.       I had not advanced two 
hundred paces ere I discovered that I had lost my way; I looked 
round, and found myself in an antique and desert wood of firs, to
the roots of which it appeared the axe had never been laid.      
I still hastened onwards a few steps, and perceived I was among 
dreary rocks, surrounded only by moss and stones, between which 
lay piles of snow and ice.       The wind was extremely cold, and
when I looked round, the forest had wholly disappeared.       Yet
a few paces forward, the stillness of death possessed 
me       the ice on which I stood stretched boundlessly before 
me       a dark mist hung over it       the red sun looked from 
the edge of the <span 
class="pagenum">p. 108horizon.       The cold was 
intolerable; I knew not how it had happened, but the benumbing 
frost forced me to accelerate my steps.       I heard the roar of
distant waters       another bewildered step, and I was on the 
ice-borders of the ocean.       Countless herds of seals dashed 
splashing into the stream.       I followed the sea-shore, and 
saw again naked rocks, land, forests of birch and 
pine-trees.       I moved forwards for a few minutes       it was
burning hot: around me were richly cultivated rice-fields under 
mulberry-trees, in whose shadow I sat down, and looking at my 
watch, I found it not less than a quarter of an hour since I left
the village.       I fancied I was dreaming       I bit my tongue
to awake myself, and I was aroused most thoroughly.       I 
closed my eyes in order to assemble my thoughts.       I heard 
strange nasal sounds       I looked around; two Chinese, whose 
Asiatic countenances I could not mistake, were saluting me 
according to the custom of their country, and in their own 
language; I arose and walked back two steps.       I saw them no 
longer       the landscape was wholly changed; trees and woods 
had succeeded to the rice-fields.       I looked pensively on the
trees and plants which were blooming around me, and saw that they
were the productions of South-eastern Asia.       I went towards 
a tree       and all <span 
class="pagenum">p. 109was again changed.       I walked 
forwards like a drilled recruit, with slow paces.       Wonderful
varieties of countries, fields, meadows, mountains, wastes, and 
sandy deserts rolled along before my astounded sight; doubtless I
had the seven-leagued boots on my legs.
<span 
class="pagenum">p. 110CHAPTER X.
I fell down on my knees in speechless devotion, and shed tears
of gratitude       my future destiny seemed bright in my 
soul.       Shut out from human society by my early guilt, 
nature, which I had ever loved, was given me for my enjoyment, 
spread out like a rich garden before me, an object of study for 
the guide and strength of my life, of which science was to be the
end.       It was no decision of my own.       What then appeared
bright and perfect in my inner thoughts I have since endeavoured 
to describe with calm, earnest, unremitting diligence, and my 
happiness has depended on the intensity of my recollections.
I rose up hastily, in order that by a rapid survey I might 
take possession of the field in which I wished to make my 
harvest.       I stood upon the mountains of Thibet, and the sun,
which had risen a few hours before, was now sinking in the 
evening sky.       I journeyed from the east towards the west of 
Asia, overtaking the sun in his progress, and passed the 
boundaries <span 
class="pagenum">p. 111of Africa.       I looked round with
great curiosity, and crossed it in all directions.       As I 
glanced over the old pyramids and temples of Egypt, I observed in
the deserts near the hundred-gated Thebes, the caverns once 
occupied by Christian anchorites: instantly it occurred 
impressively and distinctly to me       there is thy abode.      
I chose for my future dwelling, one of the most secret chambers, 
which was at the same time roomy, convenient, and inaccessible to
the jackals, and moved forward with my staff.
I passed into Europe by the Pillars of Hercules, and, after I 
had taken a rapid survey of its southern and northern provinces, 
I hastened to North Asia, and thence over the polar glaciers to 
Greenland and America.       I rambled through both parts of that
continent, and the winter which had begun to reign in the south 
now drove me quickly back northwards from Cape Horn.
I lingered till the day dawned in eastern Asia, and after a 
short repose again entered on my wanderings.       I followed the
chains of mountains, through the two Americas, some of the 
highest elevations known in our globe.       I trod slowly and 
prudently from height to height, now over flaming volcanos, and 
now over snowy cupolas.       I was often almost breathless with 
p. 
112weariness, but I reached the Elias mountain and sprung 
to Asia across Behring       s Straits.       I pursued the 
western coast along its numerous windings, and endeavoured to 
ascertain by special observation which of the islands in the 
neighbourhood were accessible to me.       From the Malacca 
peninsula my boots took me to Sumatra, Java, Balli, and 
Lamboc.       I endeavoured, often with peril, and always in 
vain, to find a north-west passage over the inlets and the rocks 
with which the ocean is studded, to Borneo and the other islands 
of the Eastern Archipelago       but I was obliged to abandon the
hope.       I sat down at last on the farthest verge of Lamboc, 
and turning my eyes to the south and east, I wept as if within 
the grates of a prison, that I could proceed no farther.       
New Holland, <a href="#footnote112" 
class="citation">[112] that extraordinary country, so 
essentially necessary to understanding the philosophy of the 
earth, and its sun-embroidered dress, the vegetable and the 
animal world; and the South Sea with its Zoophyte islands, were 
interdicted to me; and thus everything on which I would have 
gathered together and erected my hopes was condemned to be left a
mere fragment, even in its very origin.       O, my Adalbert! 
such is the reward for all the labours of man!
p.
113In the coldest winter of the southern hemisphere I have
stood on Cape Horn, meditating on the two hundred paces, or 
thereabouts, which divided me from New Holland and Van 
Diemen       s Land       careless about the means of returning, 
and indifferent even though that strange land should lie over me 
like the cover of my bier.       I attempted to cross the polar 
glaciers towards the west, and, with foolishly daring yet 
desponding steps, to pass upon the floating ice, braving the 
frost and the waves.       In vain       I have never yet been in
New Holland.       I returned again to Lamboc       again I sat 
myself on the outer verge       my face turned to the south and 
east, and wept again, as if at the fast-closed iron-window of my 
prison.




I rose up at last from this spot, and with a dejected heart 
journeyed to the interior of Asia.       I hastened onwards, 
perceiving the day break towards the west, and at night reached 
my before-described abode in Thebes, which I had just looked into
the previous afternoon.
As soon as I had taken some repose, and the day had dawned 
upon Europe, my first care was to provide for my 
necessities.       First, stop-shoes; for I had discovered that, 
however inconvenient it might be, there was no way of shortening 
my pace in order to move conveniently <a 
name="page114">p. 114in my 
immediate neighbourhood, except by drawing off my boots.       A 
pair of slippers, however, produced the wished-for effect, and 
henceforward I always took care to be provided with a couple of 
pair, as I often threw one pair away if I had not time to lay 
hold of them, when the approach of lions, men, or hy       nas 
interrupted my botanizing.       My excellent watch was an 
admirable chronometer to me for the short period of my 
peregrinations; but I required a sextant, some philosophical 
instruments, and books.
In order to obtain all these things, I made some tedious 
journeys to London, and Paris, which were both overshadowed by 
friendly fogs.       As I had exhausted the remainder of my magic
gold, I brought with me for the purposes of payment, some African
elephants        teeth which I easily obtained, though I was 
obliged to choose the smallest among them, that they might not be
too much for my strength.       I was soon supplied and stocked 
with everything I required, and began my new mode of life as a 
retired philosopher.
I journeyed over the east, now measuring its 
mountains       now the temperature of its streams and of its 
air; now observing its animals       now examining its 
plants.       I hastened from the <a 
name="page115">p. 115equator to 
the pole       from one world to another       comparing 
experience with experience.       The eggs of the African 
ostrich, or the northern sea-fowl, and fruits, especially 
tropical palms and bananas, were my usual refreshments.       
Instead of my departed fortune I enjoyed my 
Nicotiana       it served instead of the good opinion of 
mankind.       And then as to my affections: I had a love of a 
little dog, that watched my Theban cave, and when I returned to 
it laden with new treasures, it sprang forwards to meet me, 
making me feel the spirit of humanity within me, and that I was 
not quite alone on the earth.       But, notwithstanding this, 
calamity was yet to drive me back to the haunts of men!
<span 
class="pagenum">p. 116CHAPTER XI.
Once, being on the northern coast, having drawn on my boots 
while I was gathering together my straggling plants and seaweeds,
a white bear approached unawares the verge of the rock on which I
stood.       I wished to throw off my slippers and move off to an
adjacent island, which I expected to reach over a rock whose head
towered above the waves.       With one foot I reached the rock; 
I stretched out the other and fell into the sea: I had not 
observed that my foot was only half-released from the 
slipper.




Overpowered by the tremendous cold, I had the greatest 
difficulty in rescuing my life from this peril; but as soon as I 
reached the land, I hurried off to the wastes of Libya to dry 
myself there in the sun.       I had, however, scarcely set out 
ere the burning heat so oppressed my head, that I reeled back 
again to the north very ill.       I sought relief in rapid 
movements; and with uncertain and hurried steps I hastened from 
the west to the east, and from the east to the <a
name="page117">p. 117west.      
I placed myself in the most rapid vicissitudes of day and night; 
now in the heats of summer, and now in the winter       s 
cold.
I know not how long I thus wandered over the earth.       A 
burning fever glowed through my veins, and with dreadful agony I 
perceived my intellect abandoning me.       Misfortune would have
it that I should carelessly tread on a traveller       s heel; I 
must have hurt him, for I received a violent blow; I staggered, 
and fell.
When I recovered my senses I was comfortably stretched on an 
excellent bed, which stood among many others in a roomy and 
handsome apartment.       Somebody was sitting near my pillow; 
many persons passed through the hall, going from one bed to 
another.       They stood before mine, and I was the subject of 
their conversation.       They called me Number Twelve; 
and on the wall at the foot of my bed that number certainly 
stood       it was no illusion, for I could read it most 
distinctly: there was a black marble slab, on which was inscribed
in large golden letters, my name,
Peter Schlemihl,
quite correctly written.       On the slab, and under my name,
were two lines of letters, but I was <a 
name="page118">p. 118too weak to
connect them, and closed my eyes again.
I heard something of which Peter Schlemihl was the subject, 
loudly and distinctly uttered, but I could not collect the 
meaning.       I saw a friendly man and a beautiful woman in 
black apparel, standing before my bed.       Their forms were not
strangers to me, though I could not recognize them.
Some time passed by, and I gradually gathered strength.       
I was called No. 12, and No. 12, by virtue of his long beard, 
passed off for a Jew, but was not the less attended to on that 
account.       Nobody seemed to notice that he had no 
shadow.       My boots were, as I was assured, to be found, with 
everything else that had been discovered with me, in good and 
safe keeping, and ready to be delivered to me on my 
recovery.       The place in which I lay ill was called the 
Schlemihlium; and there was a daily exhortation to pray 
for Peter Schlemihl, as the founder and benefactor of the 
hospital.       The friendly man whom I had seen at my bedside 
was Bendel; the lovely woman was Mina.
I lived peaceably in the Schlemihlium, quite unknown; 
but I discovered that I was in Bendel       s native place, and 
that he had built this hospital with the remainder of my 
once-unhallowed <span 
class="pagenum">p. 119gold.       The unfortunate blessed 
me daily, for he had built it in my name, and conducted it wholly
under his own inspection.       Mina was a widow: an unlucky 
criminal process had cost Mr. Rascal his life, and taken from her
the greater part of her property.       Her parents were no 
more.       She dwelt here like a pious widow, and dedicated 
herself to works of charity.
She was once conversing with Mr. Bendel near the bed No. 
12.              Why, noble woman, expose yourself to the bad air
which is so prevalent here?       Is your fate then so dreary 
that you long for death?                     No, Mr. Bendel; 
since I have dreamt out my long dreams, and my inner self was 
awakened, all is well       death is the object of neither my 
hopes nor my fears.       Since then, I think calmly of the past 
and of the future.       And you       do you not yet serve your 
master and friend in this godlike manner, with sweet and silent 
satisfaction?                     Yes, noble woman       God be 
praised!       Ours has been a marvellous destiny.       From our
full cup we have thoughtlessly drunk much joy and much bitter 
sorrow:        tis empty now.       Hitherto we have had only a 
trial; now, with prudent solicitude, we wait for the real 
introduction to substantial things.       Far different is the 
true beginning; but who would <a 
name="page120">p. 120play over 
again the early game of life, though it is a blessing, on the 
whole, to have lived?       I am supported by the conviction that
our old friend is better provided for now than 
then.                     I feel it too,        answered the 
lovely widow, and they left me.
This conversation had produced a deep impression within me; 
but I doubted in my mind if I should discover myself, or set out 
unknown from the place.       I decided, however; I ordered paper
and pencil to be brought to me, and wrote these words:       
       Your old friend too is better provided for than 
formerly, and if he do penance it is the penance of 
reconciliation.       
On this, finding myself better, I desired to dress 
myself.       The keys were deposited on the little trunk which 
stood close to my bed.       I found in it everything that 
belonged to me: I put on my clothes; and hung over my black coat 
my botanical case, where I found again, with transport, my 
northern plants.       I drew on my boots, laid the note which I 
had written on my bed, and when the door opened, was far on my 
way towards Thebes.
A long time ago, as I was tracing back my way homewards along 
the Syrian coast, the last time I had wandered from my dwelling, 
I p. 
121saw my poor Figaro approaching me.       This charming 
spaniel seemed to wish to follow the steps of his master, for 
whom he must have so long waited.       I stood still and called 
him to me.       He sprang barking towards me, with a thousand 
expressions of his innocent and extravagant joy.       I took him
under my arm, for, in truth, he could not follow me, and brought 
him with me safely home.
I found everything thus in order, and returned again, as my 
strength returned, to my former engagements and habits of 
life.       And now for a whole twelvemonth I have refrained from
exposing myself to the unbearable winter       s cold.
And thus, my beloved Chamisso       thus do I yet live.       
My boots have not lost their virtues, as the very learned tome of
Tieckius, De rebus gestis Pollicilli, gave me reason to 
apprehend.       Their power is unbroken: but my strength is 
failing, though I have confidence I have applied them to their 
end, and not fruitlessly.       I have learned more profoundly 
than any man before me, everything respecting the earth: its 
figure, heights, temperature; its atmosphere in all its changes; 
the appearance of its magnetic strength; its productions, 
especially of the vegetable world; all in every part whither my 
boots would carry me.       I have published the <!-- page 
122-->p. 
122facts, clearly arranged, with all possible accuracy, in
different works, with my ideas and conclusions set down in 
various treatises.       I have established the geography of 
interior Africa and of the North Pole,       of central Asia and 
its eastern coasts.       My Historia Stirpium Plantarum 
utriusque Orbis has appeared, being but a large fragment of 
my Flora universalis Terr       , and a companion to my 
Systema Natur       .       In that I believe I have not 
only increased the number of known species more than a third 
(moderately speaking), but have thrown some light on the general 
system of nature, and the geography of plants.       I am now 
busily engaged with my Fauna.       I will take care before my 
death that my MSS. be disposed in the Berlin university.
And you, my beloved Chamisso, you have I chosen for the keeper
of my marvellous history, which, when I shall have vanished from 
the earth, may tend to the improvement of many of its 
inhabitants.       But, my friend, while you live among mankind, 
learn above all things first to reverence your shadow, and next 
your money.       If you will only live for Chamisso and his 
better self, you need no counsel of mine.
FINIS.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
