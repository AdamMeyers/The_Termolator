An Annotated Check List of the Mammals
of Michoacán, México

By

E. RAYMOND HALL and BERNARDO VILLA R.


INTRODUCTION

When General Lázaro Cardenas was President of the Republic of México,
encouragement was given by his administration to linguistic groups of
native American peoples to record in printed form, eventually in their
native languages, accounts of their cultural accomplishments and
accounts of the natural resources of the regions concerned. For the
Tarascan "Empire" centering in the state of Michoacán, a committee of
Mexicans and citizens of the United States of America was formed to
forward these aims. Under the leadership of ethnologists on the
committee, especially Professor Daniel Rubin F. de la Borbolla and
Professor Ralph L. Beals, invitations to coöperate in the studies were
extended to biologists. One of us (Hall) was invited to investigate
the fauna of native wild mammals. In 1943, assisted by a fellowship
which Hall at that time held from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial
Foundation, and with support from Miss Annie M. Alexander, through the
University of California Museum of Vertebrate Zoölogy, most of
March&mdash;March 3 to March 29, 1943&mdash;was spent in the state of Michoacán.

Bernardo Villa R. of the Instituto de Biología de la Universidad
de México was a member of the party from March 23 to 27. Previously,
March 4 to 22, Roberto Alcántar from the Universidad de
Michoacán, in Morelia, participated in the field work. Mr. J. R.
Alcorn was active in the collecting from the beginning until he
entrained for the United States on March 24. The remainder of
the field party was made up of E. Raymond Hall, his wife Mary F.
Hall, and their three sons, William Joel, Hubert H., and Benjamin
D. Hall.

From March 4 to 15 we collected at, and in the vicinity of, Pátzcuaro.
We were housed in two cottages kindly made available by
Sr. Efrain Buenrostro, in Campo Turista Janitzio, 200 meters northwest
of the railroad station in Colonia Revolución. The shore of
Lake Pátzcuaro, the cultivated fields surrounded by stone fences,
and the oak and pine forests roundabout provided varied habitats.

From March 16 to 23 we collected in the territory 1 to 6 miles
[436]
south of Tacámbaro, making our headquarters in the Europa Hotel,
in the town. The steep main street of Tacámbaro with native pines
at the upper end descends to plantings of bananas and sugar cane
at the lower end. Our collecting all was done below (south of) the
town in the semitropical country and none at all was done above
(north of) the town.

From March 24 to 27 (three night's trapping) we collected in the
vicinity of Zamora, making our headquarters in rooms diagonally
across the street intersection from the Hotel Fenix.

The resulting specimens, approximately 650 in number, were deposited
in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoölogy at the University of
California at Berkeley.

A noteworthy coincidence is that on the very day, February 26, on
which we crossed the international border into México at Laredo, the
beginning of the new volcano, Paricutín, was announced in the daily
press. Our collecting of mammals in Michoacán was nearly all done in
sight of the towering white plume of this rapidly heightening volcanic
cone and frequently our traps were thickly dusted with its wind-borne
ash. Our eagerness at that time to have stations established for
observing the effects on vertebrates of the deposition of ash, was
gratified in that Dr. Robert T. Hatt independently had the same idea
and such observations at appropriate places and times were begun by
him and staff members of the Museum of Zoölogy of the University of
Michigan. One of us, Villa, was privileged to share in these
observations in the spring of 1947.

This continuing interest in the mammals of Michoacán has made
it seem, to us, the more desirable to place on record our findings
as to kinds and occurrence of species. In doing this we have examined
the collections made previously on Cerro Tancítaro and
vicinity by the field party led by Mr. Harry Hoogstraal from the
University of Illinois and the Chicago Natural History Museum.
The specimens of mammals collected by this field party are in the
Chicago Natural History Museum and we are obliged to Mr. Karl
P. Schmidt, Mr. Colin C. Sanborn and the late Dr. Wilfred H.
Osgood for the privilege of studying this material.

Drs. William H. Burt and Emmet T. Hooper, of the Museum of
Zoölogy of the University of Michigan, lent to us for examination
five specimens of bats, of as many species, which they had taken
in Michoacán. Drs. Remington Kellogg and Henry W. Setzer have
provided us with data on specimens of deer and peccary from
Michoacán which are in the United States National Museum.
[437]
Specimens in the Institute of Biology of the University of México
have been used. Financial provision by the Kansas University
Endowment Association has enabled us to obtain specimens needed
for comparison from other parts of México.

In addition to the materials mentioned above we have used published
references to mammals of Michoacán and have prepared the
following lists of kinds of mammals positively known to us to
occur in the Mexican state of Michoacán. It is noteworthy that
specimens recorded in the literature from Acámbaro, Michoacán,
no longer are to be ascribed to Michoacán, since a relocation of the
boundary between the states of Michoacán and Guanajuato, places
Acámbaro in the latter state.

Our aims were: (1) To record kinds of mammals positively
known from the state, under the correct scientific name, and vernacular
names in English, Spanish, and Tarascan. The first Tarascan
name is given in the spelling used by Tarascans followed by the
phonetic equivalent in English in parentheses. (2) To indicate the
geographic range of each kind in the state, and, (3) To record
miscellaneous information which it is thought probably will be
useful in one way or another to other students whose work certainly
will lengthen the list of kinds of mammals known from Michoacán
and otherwise add to our knowledge of them.

Several kinds of bats, of which we lack records, certainly occur
in Michoacán. Four or five kinds of cats (genus Felis), species of
the genera Potos, Lutra, Tayra, Grison, and several other kinds of
mammals of which we now lack positive record, also probably occur
there; the list of kinds, we expect, will number more than one
hundred species and subspecies when more intensive collecting has
been done in the state. In all, we have positive record of 85 kinds
of native, wild mammals of which specimens have been examined
or recorded from Michoacán. Distances and elevations here are
recorded either in the metric system or in the English system, according
to the system used on the labels of the specimens concerned.
Unless otherwise indicated, catalogue numbers of more than 100,000
are of specimens in the University of California Museum of Vertebrate
Zoölogy and numbers of less than 100,000 are of the Chicago
Natural History Museum.

ACCOUNTS OF SPECIES AND SUBSPECIES


Didelphis mesamericana mesamericana Oken

Opossum; Spanish, Tlacuache; Tarascan, Ujkúri (Ukuri)


Did[elphys]. mes-americana Oken, Lehrbuch d. Naturgesch., pt. 3,
2:1152, 1816, type from northern México.

Didelphis mes-americana, Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 16:256,
August 18, 1902.


Range.&mdash;Statewide.

Specimens examined, 7: nos. 100063-100067, 100074, 51396, distributed by localities
as follows: Pátzcuaro (3 mi. N, 6,700 ft., 1; 2 mi. W, 6,700 ft., 2; 5 mi.
S, 7,800 ft., 1), 4; Tancítaro, 1; 1-&#190; mi. S Tacámbaro, 5,700 ft., 1; 1 mi. E and
6 mi. S Tacámbaro, 1.


Remarks.&mdash;The coarse overhair is white all the way to the base
in three specimens but is black in its distal two thirds (white in basal
third) in four specimens. The overhair, six centimeters anterior to
the base of the tail, is 83 (80-85) mm. long in the three gray specimens
(those with white overhair) and 68 (64-72) mm. long in the
black specimens. The ears and all four feet are black. The tail
is black in its proximal half and white in its distal half except in[439]
one specimen in which the distal half is almost as dark as the
proximal half. Of the two largest specimens, one is a female from
1&#190; mi. S Tacámbaro and the other, a male is from 6 mi. S of the
same place. Measurements are: Total length, &#9794; 810, &#9792; 786;
length of tail, &#9794; 360, &#9792; 348; length of hind foot, &mdash;, 58; condylobasal
length, 110.0; 99.6; zygomatic breadth, 68.5; 59.6; length of
nasals, 59.7, 45.0. The tail amounts to 48, 48 and 47 per cent of the
total length in specimens from Pátzcuaro; 50 per cent in one from
Tancítaro; 45 and 44 per cent in two from Tacámbaro. The subspecies
mesamericana probably intergrades with Didelphis virginiana
virginiana by way of D. m. texensis and D. v. pigra, as Davis
(1944:375) and other writers suggest, in which case the proper name
of the subspecies mesamericana would be Didelphis virginiana mesamericana.
Until intergradation is actually demonstrated, it seems
best to use the name D. m. mesamericana.

Most of our specimens were caught in steel traps, at meat baits,
set for small carnivores.



Marmosa canescens canescens (Allen)

Murine Opossum; Spanish, Ratón Tlacuache


Didelphis (Micoureus) canescens Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist.,
5:235, September 22, 1893, type from Santo Domingo de Guzman, Isthmus
of Tehuantepec, México.

Marmosa canescens Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 9:58, March
15, 1897.


Range.&mdash;Below Quercus belt, probably throughout western half of state.

Specimen examined, 1: no. 100062, 1 mi. E and 6 mi. S Tacámbaro, 4,000 ft.


Remarks.&mdash;The one unsexed subadult measures 5.5 mm. from Ml
to M3 inclusive, which measurement is near the minimum that
Tate (1933: table 1, Sec. 5) records for this subspecies but larger
than the maximum that he (loc. cit.) records for the subspecies
sinaloae which occurs to the northward of Michoacán. Tate (op.
cit.:141) lists two other specimens from Los Reyes. Our specimen
was caught in a mouse trap set in dry grass between a sugar cane field
and a patch of banana trees.



Sorex saussurei saussurei Merriam

Saussure Shrew; Spanish, Musaraña


Sorex saussurei Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 7:173, September
29, 1892, type from north slope Sierra Nevada de Colima, approximately
8,000 feet, Jalisco.


Range.&mdash;In and above Quercus belt, probably throughout northeastern half
of state.

Specimens examined, 14: nos. 8688, 52131-52141, 100076, 100077, distributed
by localities as follows: Pátzcuaro, 1; 4 mi. S Pátzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 2; Mount
Tancítaro (7,800 ft., 8; 9,500 ft., 1; 9,600 ft., 1; 10,000 ft., 1), 11.


[440]

Remarks.&mdash;Two males from Mount Tancítaro, with much worn
teeth, catalogue nos. 52132 and 52138, measure, respectively, as follows:
Total length, 122, 114; length of tail, 46, 43; length of hind
foot, 15, 14; condylobasal length, 18.4, 18.3; palatal length, 8.0, 7.3;
cranial breadth, 9.4, 9.2; least interorbital breadth, 3.7, 3.8; maxillary
breadth, 5.5, 5.5; maxillary tooth-row, 6.8, 6.7. The long palate
in no. 52132 and the broad brain case in both specimens appear to be
only individual variations or possibly variations correlated with the
advanced age of the two animals since in other features they do not
differ from specimens which are smaller in these two dimensions.
Jackson (1928:156) records specimens of this shrew from Mount
Patambán and Nahuatzin.



Cryptotis pergracilis pergracilis (Elliot)

Short-tailed Shrew; Spanish, Musaraña Colicorta


Blarina pergracilis Elliot, Field Columb. Mus., publ. 71, zoöl. ser.,
3:149, February, 1903, type from Ocotlan, Jalisco, México.

Cryptotis pergracilis pergracilis, Miller, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
24:223, October 31, 1911.


Range.&mdash;Probably statewide.

Specimen examined, 1: no. 1721 B. Villa R. from Colonia Ibarra, Pátzcuaro.


Remarks.&mdash;Our one specimen, originally a mount, proves to have
a crushed brain case. The specimen was saved on March 10, 1944,
by P. Luna, who in March, 1943, told one of us (Hall) that many
of these shrews fell into the cement fish-rearing tanks at the biological
station situated at Colonia Ibarra, a suburb of Pátzcuaro, on the
shore of Lake Pátzcuaro. We are indebted to Dr. H. H. T. Jackson
for examining our specimen and assigning a name to it.



Balantiopteryx plicata Peters

Sac-winged Bat; Spanish, Murciélago Sacoptero;
Tarascan word for bat is Huasís (Wasis)


Balantiopteryx plicata Peters, Monatsber. k. preuss. Akad. Wiss.
Berlin, p. 476, 1867, type from Puntaarenas, Costa Rica.


Range.&mdash;Statewide.

Specimens examined, 2: nos. 52224, 52225, from Apatzingan, 1,040 ft.


Remarks.&mdash;This bat is a cave dweller, not infrequently found
roosting with other species.



Glossophaga soricina leachii (Gray)

Long-tongued Bat; Spanish, Murciélago Siricotéro


Monophyllus leachii Gray, Voyage of the Sulphur, Zoöl., 1:18, 1844,
type from Realejo, Nicaragua.

Glossophaga soricina leachii, Miller, Proc. U. S. Nat. Mus., 46:419,
December 31, 1913.

[441]


Range.&mdash;Statewide.

Specimens examined, 4: nos. 11377, Univ. Kan., and alcoholic specimens
nos. 950-952 B. Villa R. field numbers, I. B. (specimens in Instituto de Biología,
Univ. de México), distributed by localities as follows: Hacienda El Sabino,
Michoacán, approximately 25 mi. S Uruapan, 1; El Guayabo, 34 kms. S Uruapan, 3.


Remarks.&mdash;Specimens from El Guayabo were taken in a natural
cave which they shared with Desmodus rotundus murinus and Artibeus
planirostris planirostris.

The length of the thumb averages 7.4 mm. (7.0 to 7.7). As compared
with G. s. alticola from northeast Tlaxcala according to the
description given by Davis (1944:377), our specimens agree with
alticola in length of thumb. In all other characters they correspond
to leachii.



Choeronycteris mexicana Tschudi

ongued Bat; Spanish, Murciélago Carilargo


Choeronycteris mexicana Tschudi, Fauna Peruana,
p. 72, 1844, type from México.


Range.&mdash;Statewide.

Specimens examined, 4: nos. 100078-100081, from 2 mi. W Pátzcuaro, 7,700 ft.


Remarks.&mdash;A colony of 20 or more bats of this species was found
in a natural cave. Four were caught by hand as they flew about
after we disturbed them. We returned on the following day, but
found that all the bats had left.



Leptonycteris nivalis nivalis (Saussure)

Leaf-nosed Bat; Spanish, Murciélago Lengüilarga


M[=Ischnoglossa]. nivalis Saussure, Revue et Magasin de Zoölogie,
12(ser. 2):492, November, 1860, type from near snow line on Mount Orizaba.

Leptonycteris nivalis, Miller, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 13:126, April
6, 1900.


Range.&mdash;Probably middle and higher altitudes through state.

Specimen examined, 1: no. 91911, Univ. Michigan Mus. Zoöl., from 1050 m.,
12 miles (on Huetamo Road) south of Tzitzio.


Remarks.&mdash;The subspecific name L. n. nivalis is tentatively applied
to this specimen in the absence of an opportunity to compare
it directly with the holotype or topotypes of Leptonycteris nivalis
yerbabuenae Martinez and Villa (1940:291). Unfortunately, the
materials on which this name, L. n. yerbabuenae, was based all
were destroyed in 1945 or 1946 while Villa was absent from the
Institute of Biology of the University of México.



Artibeus planirostris planirostris (Spix)
[442]

Big Leaf-nosed Bat; Spanish, Murciélago Zapotero


Phyllostoma planirostre Spix, Simiarum et vespertilionum Brasiliensium,
p. 66, 1823, type from suburbs of Bahia, Brazil.

Artibeus planirostris, Dobson, Catal. Chiroptera, British Mus., p. 515
(part), 1878.


Range.&mdash;Probably southwestern part of state.

Specimen examined, 1: no. 945b B. Villa R., field no., I.B., El Guayabo,
34 kms. S Uruapan.

Measurements.&mdash;Head and body, 89.0 mm.; total length of skull to front of
upper canines, 28.0; mastoid breadth, 15.5; zygomatic breadth, 17.8; maxillary
width across first upper molars, 13.2; breadth across cingula of upper canines, 7.9;
greatest length of one ramus of lower jaw including anteriormost incisor tooth,
19.4; length of upper tooth-row, anterior border of canine to posterior border
of M2, 10.4; length of lancet (nose-leaf), 9.0; width of lancet, 6.5; width of
horseshoe, 9.0; forearm, 57.3; 3rd metacarpal, 52.6; 1st (basal) phalanx, 16.0;
2nd (middle) phalanx, 26.7; 3rd (distal) phalanx, 18.5; 4th metacarpal, 50.7;
1st (basal) phalanx, 14; 2nd phalanx, 18.8; 5th metacarpal, 54; 1st (basal)
phalanx, 11.2; 2nd phalanx, 13.2; lower leg, 22.9; foot with claws, 15.2; calcar,
6.5.


Remarks.&mdash;Our single specimen, a female, was caught on July
28, 1945, by my (B. Villa's) father, Andres Villa, in a natural cave,
roosting with the individuals of Glossophaga s. leachii. The northernmost
locality in México from which A. p. planirostris previously
has been recorded is El Papayo, in the state of Guerrero (Andersen,
1908:238), approximately 225 kilometers to the southward. A. p.
planirostris and Artibeus jamaicensis closely resemble each other
but A. planirostris may be recognized by the presence of a minute
M3 which is absent in A. jamaicensis. Specimen no. 945b has M3
present on both sides of the upper jaw. From Artibeus hirsutus,
known from La Salada, Michoacán, approximately 40 miles north
and slightly to the east of El Guayabo, our specimen differs in the
apparently hairless tibia and interfemoral membrane. The measurements,
of no. 945b, recorded above, if compared with those given
by Andersen (1908:246) are seen mostly to fall within the range
recorded for A. hirsutus. Where measurements are outside this
range, they fall within the range of those of the larger A. p. planirostris.
We recognize that the Mexican species of Artibeus are not
well understood, at least by us.


Artibeus hirsutus K. Andersen

Leaf-nosed Bat; Spanish, Murciélago Zapotero


Artibeus hirsutus K. Andersen, Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist., 18(ser. 7):420,
December, 1906, type from La Salada, Michoacán.


Range.&mdash;Known from western part of state.


[443]

Remarks.&mdash;From Michoacán, Andersen (1908:247) examined
three specimens, all from the type locality.



Desmodus rotundus murinus Wagner

Vampire Bat; Spanish, Vampiro


D[esmodus]. murinus Wagner, Schreber's Säugethiere, Suppl., 1:377, 1840,
type from México.

Desmodus rotundus murinus, Osgood, Field Mus. Nat. Hist., publ. 155,
zoöl. ser., 10:63, January 10, 1912.


Range.&mdash;Statewide, except rare or absent at higher altitudes.

Specimens examined, 6: nos. 944-949 B. Villa R. field numbers, I.B., El
Guayabo, 34 kms. S Uruapan.


Remarks.&mdash;This species is colonial; usually it is found in large
numbers in favorite roosting sites, mainly in natural caves. Four
of our specimens, caught in July, are females and two are young
males. One, female, no. 944, has one embryo of 40 mm. in length.



Myotis yumanensis lutosus Miller and Allen

Yuma Myotis; Spanish, Murciélago de Yuma


Myotis yumanensis lutosus Miller and Allen, U. S. Nat. Mus., Bull.,
144:72, May 25, 1928, type from Pátzcuaro, Michoacán.

Myotis yumanensis, Miller, N. Amer. Fauna,
 13:67, October 16, 1897.


Range.&mdash;Known only from Pátzcuaro and El Molino.


Remarks.&mdash;Originally recorded by Miller (1897:67) from Pátzcuaro,
the animals from central México were named as a new subspecies
by Miller and Allen (1928:72) who record one specimen
from El Molino.



Myotis velifer velifer (Allen)

Cave Bat; Spanish, Murciélago Vespertino


Vespertilio velifer J. A. Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 3:177,
December 10, 1890, type from Santa Cruz del Valle, Guadalajara, Jalisco.

Myotis velifer velifer, Allen and Miller,
 U. S. Nat. Mus. Bull., 144:89, May 25, 1928.


Range.&mdash;Statewide.

Specimens examined, 17: nos. 100083-100099, from 3 mi. NW Pátzcuaro,
6,700 ft.


Remarks.&mdash;Our specimens were taken on March 12, 1943, from
a crevice in the wall of an abandoned chapel where 35 or more
individuals of both sexes were living. Miller (1897:59) records
the species from Pátzcuaro and Miller and Allen (1928:91) record
it from there and also from Lake Chapala, La Palma, Acámbaro
(now in Guanajuato) and Negrete.

[444]


Myotis thysanodes thysanodes Miller

Fringed-tailed Myotis; Spanish, Murciélago Colirugosa


Myotis thysanodes Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:80, October 16, 1897,
type from Old Fort Tejon, Kern County, California.


Range.&mdash;Known only from Pátzcuaro.


Remarks.&mdash;In the original description five specimens are recorded
from Pátzcuaro and Miller and Allen (1928:127) mention the same
locality of occurence.



Myotis californicus mexicanus (Saussure)

California Myotis; Spanish, Murciélago de California


V[espertilio]. mexicanus Saussure, Rev. et Mag. de Zoöl., 12 (ser. 2):282,
1860, type from somewhere in the warmer part of the state of México.

Myotis californicus mexicanus, Miller, N. Amer.
Fauna, 13:73, October 16, 1897.


Range.&mdash;Known in Michoacán only from Pátzcuaro.


Remarks.&mdash;Specimens from Pátzcuaro are recorded by Miller
and Allen (1928:160).



Eptesicus fuscus miradorensis (H. Allen)

Big Brown Bat; Spanish, Murciélago Fusco


S[cotophilus]. miradorensis H. Allen, Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia,
p. 287, 1866, type from Mirador, Veracruz.

Eptesicus fuscus miradorensis, Miller, N. Amer. Land Mamm., 1911,
p. 62, December 31, 1912.


Range.&mdash;Probably statewide.

Specimen examined, 1: no. 91909, Univ. Michigan, Mus. Zoöl., from Rancho
Escondido, one mile north of Apo, 6,000 feet elevation, June 29, 1947, female
adult, taken by W. H. Burt.




Lasiurus borealis mexicanus (Saussure)

Red Bat; Spanish, Murciélago Rojizo


A[talapha]. mexicana Saussure, Rev. et Mag. de Zoöl., 13(2):97,
March, 1861, type probably from Veracruz, Puebla or Oaxaca.

Lasiurus borealis mexicanus, Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:111, October
16, 1897.


Range.&mdash;Probably larger part of state.

Specimen examined, 1: no. 89446, Univ. Michigan, Mus. Zoöl., from Nuevo
San Juan (Los Conejos), 5 mi. SW Uruapan, May 23, 1945, by W. H. Burt.


Remarks.&mdash;This specimen, a male with much worn teeth, answers
well to the description of L. b. mexicanus except that the minute
premolar between the canine and fourth premolar is missing on
each side of the upper jaw. This, however, seems the less remarkable
after examination of 18 skulls of L. b. borealis from the United
States in two of which these minute premolars are likewise absent;
one of the two specimens from the United States has unworn teeth
and the other much worn teeth.[445]



Lasiurus cinereus cinereus (Beauvois)

Hoary Bat; Spanish, Murciélago Pardo


Vespertilio cinereus (misspelled linereus) Beauvois, Catal. Raisonné
Mus. Peale, Philadelphia, p. 18, 1796, type locality, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Lasiurus cinereus, H. Allen, Monogr. N. Amer. Bats, Smithsonian
Misc. Colls., 7(1): 12, June, 1864.


Range.&mdash;Higher elevations throughout state.

Specimen examined, 1: no. 89456, Univ. Michigan Mus. Zoöl., from Barranca
Seca, May 6, 1945, adult male with much worn teeth, obtained by W. H. Burt.




Corynorhinus rafinesquii mexicanus G. M. Allen

Long-eared Bat; Spanish, Murciélago Narigudo


Corynorhinus megalotis mexicanus Allen, G. M., Bull. Mus. Comp.
Zoöl., 60:347, April, 1916, type from "near Pacheco," Chihuahua.

Corynorhinus rafinesquii mexicanus, Miller, U. S. Nat. Mus., Bull.,
128:83, April 29, 1924.

Corynorhinus macrotis pallescens, Miller, N. Amer. Fauna, 13:52,
October 16, 1897.


Range.&mdash;Known from only Pátzcuaro.


Remarks.&mdash;Miller (1897:53) recorded one specimen from Pátzcuaro
and Allen (1916:349) merely alludes to Miller's record.



Tadarida mexicana (Saussure)

Mexican Free-tailed Bat; Spanish, Murciélago Coludo


Molossus mexicanus Saussure, Rev. et Mag. de Zoöl., 12:283, July,
1860, type from Cofre de Perote, 13,000 feet, Veracruz.

Tadarida mexicana, Miller, Bull. U. S.
 Nat. Mus., 128:86, April 29, 1924.


Range.&mdash;Statewide.

Specimens examined, 12: nos. 100100-100111, distributed by localities as follows:
1 mi. N Zamora, 5,450 ft., 1; 3 mi. N Pátzcuaro, 6,800 ft., 3; 3 mi. NW
Pátzcuaro, 6,700 ft., 3; Isla Janitzio, Lago de Pátzcuaro, 6,600 ft., 5.


Remarks.&mdash;This species is widespread in México, ranging from
sea level to high elevations as at the type locality. In Michoacán
most of our specimens were shot as they flew about at early dusk.
The five from Isla Janitzio were shot as they clung to the roof of a
cave along with scores of other individuals of the same species.



Eumops underwoodi underwoodi Goodwin

Mastiff Bat; Spanish, Murciélago Mastin


Eumops underwoodi Goodwin, Amer. Mus. Novitates, 1075:2, June
27, 1940, type from El Pedrero, 6 km. N Chinaela, approximately 3,000
ft. elevation, Dept. La Paz, Honduras.


Range.&mdash;Known only from Tancítaro Mtn.

Specimen examined, 1: no. 89461, Univ. Michigan Mus. Zoöl., from Rancho
Escondido, 2 mi. N Apo, Tancítaro Mtn., &#9792; ad. with much worn teeth, taken
June 11, 1945, by W. H. Burt.


Remarks.&mdash;Selected measurements of this specimen are: Total
length, 158; ear from notch, 32; mastoid breadth, 16.1; width across[446]
crowns of M3, 12.6; maxillary tooth-row (from anterior face of
canine above cingulum to posterior face of M3), 11.8. The total
length is less than in E. underwoodi or than in Eumops sonoriensis
Benson (1947:133); the other measurements given above exceed
those of E. sonoriensis and equal or approach those of E. underwoodi.
The ears seem not to be connected across the forehead; the
color is near (l) Bister above and slightly lighter on the underparts.

The specimen is clearly intermediate in size, as it also is geographically,
between Eumops underwoodi underwoodi Goodwin and
Eumops underwoodi sonoriensis Benson and gives basis for arranging
these two named kinds as subspecies of a single species as Benson
(1947:134) suggested might prove to be necessary. We are not
certain whether this specimen should be referred to the subspecies
underwoodi or sonoriensis and probably this uncertainty will remain
until the range of individual variation in underwoodi is known.



Procyon lotor hernandezii Wagler

Raccoon; Spanish, Mapache; Tarascan, Apátze (Apatz)


Pr[ocyon] hernandezii Wagler, Isis, 24:514,
 1831, type from Valley of México, according to Nelson and Goldman
 (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 44:17, February 21, 1931).

Procyon lotor hernandezii, Allen, Bull.
 Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 3:176, December 10, 1890.


Range.&mdash;Statewide.

Specimens examined, 2: no. 100113 from 10 mi. ESE Zamora, 5,500 ft., 1;
no. 52220 from 15 kms. W Apatzingan, 1,040 ft., 1.


Remarks.&mdash;In allusion to its habit of washing its food, in captivity
at least, before eating it, the Spanish speaking people often
refer to this species as ositos labadores. The specimen from 10 mi.
ESE Zamora is a skull without lower jaws or indication of sex.
Because the racoons damage corn in the roasting ear stage the
animals are disliked by the farmers, a score of whom sometimes
band together in an organized hunt to kill the animals. Dogs are
especially trained to hunt them. In Michoacán no use is made of
the pelts.



Nasua narica molaris Merriam

Coati; Spanish, Pizote; Tarascan, Amátze (Amatz)


Nasua narica molaris Merriam, Proc. Biol.
 Soc. Washington, 15:68, March 22, 1902, type from Manzanillo, Colima;
 Goldman, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 55:79, June 25, 1942.


Range.&mdash;Probably all but higher parts of state.


Remarks.&mdash;We have no positive record of this animal which
Goldman (1942:79) writes "is widely distributed from Jalisco south
through Colima, Michoacán, ... to southwestern Oaxaca."
[447]
In the parts of Michoacán visited by us the Spanish name tejón
instead of pizote was used for this animal although in parts of
México where the badger (Taxidea) occurs, tejón is, we understand,
the name used for the badger.



Bassariscus astutus consitus Nelson and Goldman

Ring-tailed Cat; Spanish, Cacomixtle


Bassariscus astutus consitus Nelson and
 Goldman, Jour. Washington Acad. Sci., 22:487, October 19, 1932,
 type from La Salada, 40 mi. S Uruapan, Michoacán.


Range.&mdash;Probably greater part, or all, of state.

Specimen examined, 1: no. 100112 from 3 mi. NW Pátzcuaro, 6,700 ft.


Remarks.&mdash;La Salada and three miles northwest of Pátzcuaro
are the two localities represented by actual specimens. A live animal,
at night, was seen one mile east and four miles south of
Tacámbaro at 4,500 feet elevation. The young female from three
miles northwest of Pátzcuaro was trapped at a break in a stone
fence.

Ring-tailed cats live in the stone walls, crevices and rocky ledges,
around corn fields and pasture lands.



Mustela frenata leucoparia (Merriam)

Weasel; Spanish, Comadreja; Tarascan, Apásr or Apatzee (Apatz)


Putorius frenatus leucoparia Merriam,
 N. Amer. Fauna, 11:29, June 30, 1896, type from Pátzcuaro, Michoacán.

Mustela frenata leucoparia, Miller, Bull.
 U. S. Nat. Mus., 79:100, December 31, 1912.


Range.&mdash;Probably statewide.

Specimens examined, 6: in Biological Surveys Collection of U. S. Nat. Mus.,
nos. 120304, 125972, 34914/47179, 36855/49239, and 34915/47180; 2014 B. Villa R.,
I.B., distributed as follows: Zamora, 1; Los Reyes, 1; Pátzcuaro, 4.


Remarks.&mdash;This subspecies of weasel is notable for having, among
American weasels of any kind, the maximum amount of white on
the head. When collecting at Pátzcuaro we saw no live specimens
but were shown several from there that had been recently mounted
by P. Luna. He regarded the animal as not especially rare.



Spilogale angustifrons angustifrons Howell

Spotted Skunk; Spanish, Zorrillo Manchado


Spilogale angustifrons Howell, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 15:242,
December 16, 1902, type from Tlalpam, D. F.


Range.&mdash;Probably all of state except low coastal area.

Specimen examined, 1: no. 100126, 3 mi. NW Pátzcuaro, 6,700 ft.


Remarks.&mdash;The short tail of our specimen, an adult male, is noteworthy
as perhaps also is the breadth between the orbits. External[448]
measurements are 338, 101, 39. It weighed 308 grams. Selected
cranial measurements are: Basilar length, 44.1; zygomatic breadth,
32.4; postpalatal length, 26.6; least interorbital breadth, 13.8; height
of cranium, 16.0. The specimen was trapped in a hole in a stone
fence. Howell (1906:23), under the name Spilogale gracilis, recorded
another male from Pátzcuaro.



Mephitis macroura macroura Lichtenstein

Hooded Skunk; Spanish, Zorrillo or Mofeta Rayada; Tarascan,
Cuitziqui (Kweetzeke)


Mephitis macroura Lichtenstein, Darstellung Neuer oder wenig bekannter
Säugethiere pl. 46, 1832, type from mountains northwest of
México City.


Range.&mdash;Statewide.

Specimens examined, 12: nos. 100114-100125, distributed with reference to
Pátzcuaro, as follows: 3 mi. NW, 6,700 ft., 1; 2 mi. W, 7,600 and 7,000 ft., 2;
3&#189; mi. S, 7,900 ft., 1; 4 mi. S, 7,800 ft., 2; 5 mi. S, 7,800 ft., 5; 9 mi. SE, 8,000
ft., 1.


Remarks.&mdash;Skunk tracks were abundant in all localities around
Pátzcuaro. Most of our specimens were caught in steel traps, some
along the edges of cornfields, others along the highway and along
the pole fences. Tarascan friends at Colonia Revolución were eager
to have the bodies of the skunks which we caught. They regarded
the skunks as a delicacy and told us that this food was reputed to
be good for a person's blood and complexion.



Conepatus mesoleucus nelsoni Goldman

Hog-nosed Skunk; Spanish, Zorillo Real


Conepatus mesoleucus nelsoni Goldman, Jour. Mamm.,
 3:41, February 8, 1922, type from Armería (near Manzanillo), Colima,
 200 ft. altitude.


Range.&mdash;Probably greater part, or all, of state.

Specimen examined, 1: no. 52217, Tancítaro, 6,000 ft.


Remarks.&mdash;The name C. m. nelsoni is tentatively used for the
single skin, which is without skull or indication of sex.



Urocyon cinereoargenteus colimensis Goldman

Gray Fox; Spanish, Zorra Gris; Tarascan, Cúmihuátz (Cumewatz)


Urocyon cinereoargenteus colimensis Goldman, Jour. Washington Acad.
Sci., 28:495, November 15, 1938, type from 3 mi. W city of Colima, 1,700
ft. elevation.


Range.&mdash;Statewide.

Specimens examined, 2: no. 100127, from 1 mi. E and 6 mi. S Tacámbaro,
4,000 ft., and no. 51393 from Apatzingan.


Remarks.&mdash;The female from southeast of Tacámbaro, caught on
March 20, 1943, had two embryos, 28 mm. in length. This female
was trapped near a small stream. Goldman (1938:497) reported
7 specimens of U. c. colimensis from the following localities in the
state: La Huacana, 1; La Salada, 2; Los Reyes, 1; Mount Tancítaro,
1; Pátzcuaro, 2.

Canis latrans cagottis (Hamilton Smith)

Coyote; Spanish, Coyote; Tarascan, Jihuátz (Hewatz)


Lyciscus cagottis Hamilton Smith, Jardine's Naturalist's Library,
Mamm., 9:164, 1839, type from Río Frío between city of México and
Puebla.

Canis latrans cagottis, Nelson, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 45:224,
November 26, 1932.


Range.&mdash;Probably most of state.


Remarks.&mdash;On March 27 or 28, 1943, in Morelia, at a gasoline
filling station, one of us (Hall) saw a freshly killed coyote tied on
the bumper of the automobile of a Medical Doctor. In response to
inquiry about the animal the Doctor said that he killed it some 15
miles northeast of town.



Lynx rufus escuinapae Allen

Bobcat; Spanish, Gato del Monte; Tarascan, Misícpápu (misicpapu)


Lynx ruffus escuinapae Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 19:614, November
14, 1903, type from Escuinapa, Sinaloa.


Range.&mdash;Probably all of state above the Tropical Life-zone.

Specimen examined, 1: no. 47818 (U. S. Nat. Mus., Biol. Surv. Coll.), Pátzcuaro.


Remarks.&mdash;The skull of the male from Pátzcuaro agrees well with
those of topotypes of L. r. escuinapae even to the elongate tympanic
bullae. Because of their elongation the bullae resemble, in some
degree, those of the ocelot. Natives told us that the gato del monte
was resident around Pátzcuaro. Four miles south of Pátzcuaro in
a cornfield at the edge of an area grown up to oak trees and brush,
tracks were seen that our Indian companion identified as those of
the gato del monte.



Citellus variegatus variegatus (Erxleben)

Rock Squirrel; Spanish, Ardilla de Pedregal; Tarascan,
Kuaráki (Kuaraki)


[Sciurus] variegatus Erxleben, Syst. Regni, Anim., 1:421, 1777; type
locality fixed as Valley of México near the city of México, by Nelson,
Science, N. S., 8:898, December 23, 1898.

[Citellus] variegatus, Elliot, Field Columb. Mus. Pub., zoöl. ser. 4:148,
1904.


Range.&mdash;Probably in all semi-arid, rocky habitats of the state.

Specimens examined, 11: nos. 100128-100135; 51385-51387, distributed by lo[450]calities
as follows: 1 mi. N Zamora, 5,450 ft., 1; 3 mi. NW Pátzcuaro, 6,700
ft., 5; 4 mi. S Pátzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 1; 1-&#189; mi. S Tacámbaro, 5,700 ft., 1; Mount
Tancítaro, 1; Pedregal, Tancítaro, 1; Tancítaro, 1.


Remarks.&mdash;Rock squirrels were seen along rock fences, around
Pátzcuaro, where they are fairly common. On July 17 and 18,
1947, at San Juan Parangaricutiro, one of us (Villa) saw these
squirrels running over the newly formed lava bed which was still
emitting vapors and which in places (between boulders) was
emitting heat detectable by the collectors. This is only additional
evidence of the animal's strong predilection for rocks, boulders and
cliffs, which has earned for it, in parts of the western United States,
the vernacular name "rock squirrel" and in México "Ardilla de
Pedregal."

Howell (1938:138) reported specimens from the following localities:
Acámbaro, 1; Los Reyes, 1; Mount Tancítaro, 2; Pátzcuaro,
12; Queréndaro, 1; Zamora, 2.



Citellus adocetus adocetus Merriam

Lesser Tropical Ground Squirrel; Spanish, Cuiniqui; Tarascan,
Kuaráki (Kuaraki)


Citellus adocetus Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 16:79, May
29, 1903, type from La Salada, 40 miles south of Uruapan, Michoacán.


Range.&mdash;Southern part of state in arid tropical land.

Specimens examined, 4: nos. 52000, 52001, 51388, 51389, distributed by localities
as follows: "Near Tancítaro," 2; Acahuato, 1; Apatzingan, 1,040 ft., 1.


Remarks.&mdash;Ground squirrels of this species are fairly abundant
in the arid tropical parts of the state. Their burrows are usually
found on stony areas along small ravines or under mesquite (Prosopis
juliflora) thickets. The name cuiniqui in use by the Spanish
speaking population is merely a corruption of the Tarascan name.
Cuiniqui, therefore, is a particular kind of ardilla terrícola (ground
squirrel).



Sciurus poliopus nemoralis Nelson

Michoacán Squirrel; Spanish, Ardilla arborícola; Tarascan,
Uakuí (Wakqe)


Sciurus albipes nemoralis Nelson, Proc. Biol. Soc, Washington, 12:151,
June 3, 1898, type from Pátzcuaro, Michoacán.

Sciurus poliopus nemoralis Nelson, Proc. Washington Acad. Sci., 1:50,
May 9, 1899.


Range.&mdash;Pine and oak forests of most of state.

Specimens examined, 3: nos. 2102 and 2103 Louisiana State University from
20 mi. E Morelia, 7,300 ft., and no. 1369 B. Villa R. from 1&#189; km. N San Juan
2,250 meters.


Remarks.&mdash;Tree squirrels of this kind have been reported by
Nelson (1899:51) from Pátzcuaro and Nahuatzin.[451]

The young specimen, no. 2102, &#9794;, has the tail slender, resembling
somewhat that of the S. p. senex from the southward. The underparts
of the female are Warm Buff, more clearly so on the underside
of the legs.



Sciurus poliopus senex Nelson

Michoacán Squirrel; Spanish, Ardilla Arborícola; Tarascan,
Uakuí (Wakqe)


Sciurus poliopus senex Nelson, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 17:148,
October 6, 1904, type from La Salada, 40 mi. S Uruapan.


Range.&mdash;Lowlands in southern part of state.

Specimens examined, 3: nos. 52004, 52014, 52015, distributed by localities as
follows: Tancítaro, 6,000 ft., 1; Apatzingan, 1,040 ft., 2.


Remarks.&mdash;Specimen number 52014, &#9794;, represents the melanistic
phase of this subspecies.

The upper parts of the hind legs in this specimen are slightly
grizzled. The upper side of the tail is vermiculated with whitish
and the underside of the tail is black.



Thomomys umbrinus pullus Hall and Villa

Southern Pocket Gopher; Spanish, Tuza Serrana; Tarascan, Cúmu (C&#335;m&#335;)


Thomomys umbrinus pullus Hall and Villa, Univ. Kansas Publ., Mus.
Nat. Hist., 1:251, July 26, 1948, type from 5 miles south Pátzcuaro, 7,800
ft., Michoacán.


Range.&mdash;Known only from pine-covered rolling land three to five miles south
of Pátzcuaro.

Specimens examined, 17: nos. 100136-100152, distributed by localities as follows:
3 mi. S Pátzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 1; 4 mi. S Pátzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 10; 5 mi. S
Pátzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 6.


Remarks.&mdash;Most of these pocket gophers were caught in areas
supporting a good growth of pine trees in the same places where
the much larger pocket gopher, Cratogeomys gymnurus, lived. Concerning
the individual designated as the type specimen, H. H. Hall
(field notes) writes that when he was making an excavation to reveal
the gopher's burrow (5 inches below the surface), he dug deeper
than was necessary and broke into the burrow of a Cratogeomys
directly below. Another of us (E. R. Hall) had the same experience
where the burrow of a Thomomys was approximately six inches
below ground and that of a Cratogeomys approximately 16 inches
below the surface of the ground. At the time this arrangement
led us to wonder if Thomomys was in some sense a "parasite" on
the larger Cratogeomys by levying on food stores, if Cratogeomys
has any, but we found no evidence that such was the case and from
[452]
our subsequent trapping concluded that the two-story arrangement
was accidental and not the rule. The habit of burrowing at different
levels probably was one factor which permitted the two kinds of
pocket gophers to live in the same area. The average weight of
these gophers was 86 grams in males and 74 grams in females, or
only an eighth as much as in Cratogeomys.



Cratogeomys gymnurus imparilis (Goldman)

Plains Pocket Gopher; Spanish, Tuza Llanera; Tarascan,
Cúmu (C&#335;m&#335;)


Platygeomys gymnurus imparilis, Goldman, Jour. Mamm., 20:89, February
14, 1939, type from Pátzcuaro, 7,000 ft., Michoacán.

Platygeomys tylorhinus Merriam, N. Amer. Fauna, 8:167, pl. 13, fig.
1, January 31, 1895.


Range.&mdash;Pátzcuaro and Tacámbaro, as now known.

Specimens examined, 14: nos. 100153-100166, distributed by localities as follows:
2 mi. W Pátzcuaro, 7,700 ft., 2; 3 mi. S Pátzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 1; 4 mi. S
Pátzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 1; 5 mi. S. Pátzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 6; 9 mi. SE Pátzcuaro, 8,000
ft., 1; 1&#190; mi. S Tacámbaro, 5,700 ft., 1; 1&#189; mi. S Tacámbaro, 5,700 ft., 2.


Remarks.&mdash;Burrows were common in cultivated fields and along
the roads and trails on the southern and southeastern side of Lake
Pátzcuaro. In the vicinity of Tacámbaro we noted burrows only
in the area between one and a half and two miles south of town
where two specimens were taken. As mentioned in the immediately
preceding account, the small Thomomys umbrinus pullus and the
large Cratogeomys were found in the same area. The color of our
specimens varies from Cinnamon-Brown through Prouts Brown
and in some specimens is Fuscous Black.

Hooper (1946:397) has shown that the genus Platygeomys is not
generically distinct from the earlier named Cratogeomys. From
independent study of specimens not examined by Hooper we have
satisfied ourselves that he is correct in synonymizing Platygeomys
under Cratogeomys. Average and extreme weights of 4 of each sex
from 2 to 5 miles south of Pátzcuaro are: &#9794;, 683 (562-819); &#9792;, 558
(438-707) grams.



Cratogeomys angustirostris (Merriam)

Plains Pocket Gopher; Spanish, Tuza Llanera; Tarascan,
Cúmu (C&#335;m&#335;)


Platygeomys tylorhinus angustirostris Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
16:81, May 29, 1903, type from Patambán, 10,000 ft., Michoacán.

Platygeomys angustirostris, Goldman, Jour. Mamm., 20:90, February
14, 1939.


Range.&mdash;Known only from the type locality.
[453]



Cratogeomys varius (Goldman)

Plains Pocket Gopher; Spanish, Tuza Llanera; Tarascan,
Cúmu (C&#335;m&#335;)


Platygeomys varius Goldman, Jour. Mamm., 20:90, February 14, 1939,
type from Uruapan, about 6,000 ft., Michoacán.


Range.&mdash;Known only from the type locality.


Remarks.&mdash;Specimens from localities intermediate between Uruapan,
the type locality of C. varius, and the known localities of occurence
of Cratogeomys gynmurus imparilis are much needed to
ascertain if C. varius is specifically different from C. g. imparilis,
or merely subspecifically different.



Zygogeomys trichopus tarascensis Goldman

Michoacán Pocket Gopher; Spanish, Tuza de Michoacán; Tarascan,
Cúmu (C&#335;m&#335;)


Zygogeomys trichopus tarascensis Goldman, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
51:211, December 23, 1938, type from six miles southeast of Pátzcuaro,
8,000 ft., Michoacán.

Zygogeomys trichopus Merriam, N. Amer. Fauna, 8:196, January 31,
1895.


Range.&mdash;"Known only from the upper slopes of the mountains in the vicinity
of the type locality" (Goldman, 1938:211).


Remarks.&mdash;As we drove an automobile from Pátzcuaro to Tacámbaro
we noted mounds made by pocket gophers along the road in the
highest part of the pass and supposed that these mounds were made
by Zygogeomys although we took no specimens of any kind of
pocket gopher in the pass.



Zygogeomys trichopus trichopus Merriam

Cúmu (C&#335;m&#335;)


Zygogeomys trichopus Merriam, N. Amer. Fauna, 8:196, pl. 6, 14-18,
January 31, 1895, type from Nahuatzin, Michoacán.


Range.&mdash;Altitudinally from 6,000 feet to 11,800 feet on Mountains Tancítaro,
Patambán, and at Nahuatzin.

Specimens examined, 9: nos. 51970-51978, all from Mount Tancítaro, distributed
by altitude as follows: 6,000 ft., 5; 7,800 ft., 3; 10,500 ft., 1.


Remarks.&mdash;The upper parts of specimens available to us are rich
Seal-Brown and glossy. The chin, and in most specimens, the upper
side of the hind feet are white; the irregular white patch of the
throat is present only in two young females, numbers 51974 and
51978.[454]



Liomys pictus plantinarensis Merriam

Western Spiny Pocket Mouse; Spanish, Ratón Espinoso Occidental;
Tarascan word for mouse is Jeyáqui (Hayake)


Liomys plantinarensis Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 15:46,
March 5, 1902, type from Plantinar, Jalisco.

Liomys pictus plantinarensis, Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 34:37, September
7, 1911.


Range.&mdash;Northwestern part of state in semitropical areas.


Remarks.&mdash;Goldman (1911:38) records specimens from Los
Reyes, noting that in some cranial features they suggest intergradation
between L. p. plantinarensis and L. p. parviceps.



Liomys pictus parviceps Goldman

Western Spiny Pocket Mouse; Spanish, Ratón Espinoso Occidental


Liomys parviceps Goldman, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 17:82, March
21, 1904, type from La Salada, "40 miles south of Uruapan, Michoacán."

Liomys pictus parviceps Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 34:38-39, September
7, 1911.


Range.&mdash;Southern part of state in semitropical and tropical areas.

Specimens examined, 28: nos. 100185-100199, 52072-52084, distributed by localities
as follows: Apatzingan, 1,040 ft., 13; 1 mi. E and 2&#189; mi. S Tacámbaro,
4,700 ft., 4; 4 mi. S and 1 mi. E Tacámbaro, 4,500 ft., 5; 1 mi. E and 6 mi. S
Tacámbaro, 4,000 ft., 6.


Remarks.&mdash;Most measurements show a sexual dimorphism in
this subspecies. Adult males are 15 per cent larger in external
measurements except that the foot is approximately the same.
Cranial measurements average approximately 5 per cent larger in
males except that the breadth of the rostrum and length of the
maxillary tooth-row are slightly less. South and east of Tacámbaro
our specimens all were taken in dry semitropical country, where
bananas and sugar cane were the principal crops grown. This subspecies
has been recorded also from La Huacana, Michoacán, as
well as from La Salada, the type locality, by Goldman (1911:39).



Liomys irroratus jaliscensis (Allen)

Northern Spiny Pocket Mouse; Spanish, Ratón Norteño


Heteromys jaliscensis Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 22:251, July
25, 1906, type from Las Canoas, approximately 20 mi. W Zapotlán, 7,000
ft., Jalisco.

Liomys irroratus jalicensis, Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 34:60, September
7, 1911.


Range.&mdash;Northwestern part of state.

Specimens examined, 3: nos. 120273-120275 (U. S. Nat. Mus.) from Zamora.


Remarks.&mdash;As explained in detail by Hall and Villa (1948:254)
these specimens from Zamora are intergrades between L. i. jaliscensis[455]

and L. i. acutus and with almost equal propriety could be referred
to either subspecies.



Liomys irroratus acutus Hall and Villa

Northern Spiny Pocket Mouse; Spanish, Ratón Norteño


Liomys irroratus acutus Hall and Villa, Univ. Kansas Publ., Mus. Nat.
Hist., 1:253, figs. 4-6, July 26, 1948, type from 2 mi. W Pátzcuaro, 7,700
ft., Michoacán.

Liomys irroratus alleni, Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 34:57, September
7, 1911, part.


Range.&mdash;Pátzcuaro and vicinity.

Specimens examined, 16: nos. 100170-100184 and 50356 (U. S. N. M.), distributed,
with reference to Pátzcuaro, as follows: 3 mi. NW, 6,700 ft., 1; 2 mi.
W, 7,700 ft., 5; 2 mi. W, 6,700 ft., 2; Pátzcuaro itself, 1; 5 mi. S, 7,800 ft., 7.


Remarks.&mdash;None of the eight females contained embryos. Two
adult males weigh, in grams, 71.5 and 65.1; the average and extreme
weights for five adult females are 50.8 (44.8-61.8).



Liomys irroratus alleni (Coues)

Northern Spiny Pocket Mouse; Spanish, Ratón Norteño


Heteromys alleni Coues, Bull. Mus. Comp. Zoöl., 8:187, March, 1881,
type from Río Verde, San Luis Potosí, México.

Liomys irroratus alleni Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 34:56, September
7, 1911.


Range.&mdash;Northeastern part of state.

Specimens examined, 5: nos. 50325-50329 (U. S. Nat. Mus.) from Queréndaro.


Remarks.&mdash;The specimens from Queréndaro are not typical of the
subspecies L. i. alleni in that the shape of the interparietal bone and
width of the basisphenoid bone are almost exactly intermediate
between the conditions obtaining in typical L. i. alleni and topotypes
of L. i. acutus.



Reithrodontomys megalotis saturatus Allen and Chapman

Western Harvest Mouse; Spanish, Ratón Orejudo


Reithrodontomys saturatus Allen and Chapman, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat.
Hist., 9:201, June 16, 1897, type from Las Vigas, Veracruz.

Reithrodontomys megalotis saturatus, Howell, N. Amer. Fauna, 36:36,
June 5, 1914.


Range.&mdash;Northeastern part of state.

Specimens examined, 12: nos. 100202-100212, 100273, from 1 mi. N Zamora,
5,450 ft.


Remarks.&mdash;Howell (1914:37) referred nine specimens from Nahuatzin
to this race and two from the same place to the subspecies
R. m. zacatecae. Our specimens from Zamora agree with topotypes[456]
of R. m. saturatus and with specimens of that subspecies from the
Valley of México in dark color and large size.

If our specimens of Reithrodontomys megalotis are correctly identified,
subspecifically, R. m. zacatecae ranges southward around the
western end of the geographic range of R. m. saturatus.

Where R. megalotis and R. fulvescens occur together, we find the
skull of the latter to be distinguishable by: a median spine on the
posterior border of the hard palate (truncate in R. megalotis); an
S-shaped instead of a C-shaped pattern on the worn occlusal face
of the last lower molar; and two re-entrant angles, on the lateral
side on the worn occlusal surface of the third upper molar, reaching
halfway across the tooth whereas in R. megalotis the anterior re-*entrant
angle is wanting or extends less than a third of the way
across the crown surface of the tooth.



Reithrodontomys megalotis zacatecae Merriam

Western Harvest Mouse; Spanish, Ratón Orejudo


Reithrodontomys megalotis zacatecae Merriam, Proc. Washington
Acad. Sci., 3:557, November 29, 1901, type from Valparaiso Mountains,
Zacatecas.


Range.&mdash;From northwestern part of state south through its central part.

Specimens examined, 53: nos. 100217-100269; distributed by localities, with
reference to Pátzcuaro, as follows: 3 mi. N, 6,700 ft., 3; 3 mi. N, 6,800 ft., 1;
3&#189; mi. S, 7,900 ft., 3; 4 mi. S, 7,800 ft., 31; 5 mi. S, 7,800 ft., 9; 9 mi. SE, 8,000
ft., 6.


Remarks.&mdash;Howell (1914:40) has referred four specimens from
Patambán to this subspecies, and our large series from the vicinity
of Pátzcuaro is also referred to R. m. zacatecae because of small
size and reddish (less blackish) color. We lack typical specimens
of R. m. zacatecae from the type locality for comparison and our
knowledge of zacatecae is derived from Howell's (1914:39) description
of it.

Average measurements of 5 adult males of R. m. zacatecae from
the Pátzcuaro area showing much wear on the teeth compared with
those of five specimens from the Zamora area, of corresponding sex
and age of R. m. saturatus reveal the smaller size of R. m. zacatecae.
Total length, 157, 166; length of tail, 84, 84; length of hind foot,
19.6, 20.1; length of ear from notch in flesh, 14.8, 14.0; basilar
length, 16.2, 16.6; length of nasals, 8.3, 8.5; zygomatic breadth,
11.1, 11.5; mastoid breadth, 9.9, 10.2; breadth of rostrum, 3.8, 4.0;
interorbital construction, 3.2, 3.1; alveolar length of maxillary tooth-row,
3.5, 3.5; length of rostrum, 7.7, 8.0.[457]



Reithrodontomys fulvescens tenuis Allen

Fulvous Harvest Mouse; Spanish, Ratón Moreno


Reithrodontomys tenuis Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 12:15,
March 4, 1899, type from Rosario, Sinaloa.

Reithrodontomys fulvescens tenuis, Howell, N. Amer. Fauna, 36:45,
June 5, 1914.


Range.&mdash;Western part of state.

Specimens examined, 27: nos. 100213-100216, 100274-100277, 100293-100311,
distributed by localities as follows: 11 mi. W Zamora, 5,750 ft., 2; 6&#189; mi. W
Zamora, 5,950 ft., 2; 6 mi. W Zamora, 5,950 ft., 4; 1&#189; mi. SSE Tacámbaro,
5,700 ft., 2; 1&#190; mi. S Tacámbaro, 5,700 ft., 1; 1 mi. E and 2&#189; mi. S Tacámbaro,
7; 4 mi. S and 1 mi. E Tacámbaro, 4,700 ft., 5; 1 mi. E and 5 mi. S
Tacámbaro, 4,000 ft., 1; 1 mi. E and 6 mi. S Tacámbaro, 4,000 ft., 3.


Remarks.&mdash;Of the 19 specimens from the vicinity of Tacámbaro,
only two have the underparts reddish as does R. f. inexspectatus.
The upper parts are less reddish than in R. f. inexspectatus but
more reddish and less blackish than in R. f. toltecus from the valley
of México or than in R. f. toltecus from Zamora. The external
measurements and cranial measurements are less than in R. f.
toltecus or R. f. inexspectatus and are as small as, or even smaller
than, those of R. f. tenuis to the northward or than those of R. f.
nelsoni to the westward. Relying only on printed descriptions of
R. f. tenuis and R. f. nelsoni, we are inclined to refer our specimens
to R. f. tenuis although the reddish color, we suppose, is evidence of
intergradation with R. f. nelsoni and R. f. inexspectatus.

The four skins from Zamora are gray, as opposed to reddish, both
above and below and in this respect they agree with the description
of R. f. tenuis. They are lighter-colored (grayer) than either R. f.
toltecus or R. f. inexspectatus. The four specimens from Zamora
are larger than animals from the vicinity of Tacámbaro and average
slightly smaller than topotypes of R. f. inexspectatus.

By identifying our specimens as R. f. inexspectatus and R. f.
tenuis, we are left without any specimens that we, ourselves, have
examined, which are referable to the subspecies R. f. toltecus. The
specimens from Los Reyes which Howell (1914:47) referred to R. f.
toltecus have not been seen by us, and we guess, on the criteria
used by us, that the animals would be referable to R. f. tenuis.
Because Dr. Emmet T. Hooper has a revisionary study of the
Mexican Reithrodontomys underway, we have not attempted to
bring together all of the pertinent material from different collections
as would be required for an ideally thorough analysis of the geographic
variation in Reithrodontomys megalotis and Reithrodontomys
fulvescens.[458]

As illustrative of statements made concerning the average size of
Reithrodontomys fulvescens, the following measurements, all of
specimens with much wear on each of the molar teeth, are recorded.

Reithrodontomys fulvescens inexspectatus Elliot

Fulvous Harvest Mouse; Spanish, Ratón Moreno


Rhithrodontomys inexspectatus Elliot, Field Columb. Mus. zoöl. ser.,
3:145, February, 1903, type from Pátzcuaro, Michoacán.

Reithrodontomys fulvescens toltecus, Howell, N. Amer. Fauna, 36:51,
June 5, 1914, part.


Range.&mdash;Central Michoacán; limits of range  unknown.

Specimens examined, 15: nos. 100278-100292, distributed by localities as follows:
3 mi. N Pátzcuaro, 6,800 ft., 6; 3 mi. NW Pátzcuaro, 6,700 ft., 3; 2 mi.
W Pátzcuaro, 7,600 ft., 2; 2 mi. W Pátzcuaro, 7,700 ft., 4.


Remarks.&mdash;Howell (1914:51) made R. inexspectatus Elliot a synonym
of R. f. toltecus and perhaps we should follow him in this.
The facts are that in our large series from the vicinity of Pátzcuaro,
the upper parts are more reddish than in R. f. toltecus from the
valley of México, and more reddish than in R. f. tenuis if we correctly
interpret Howell's (op. cit.,:45) description of R. f. tenuis. In the
color of the underparts the series is, to us, indistinguishable from
topotypical toltecus and therefore has more reddish underparts than[459]
R. f. tenuis, as we know R. f. tenuis, from Howell's (loc. cit.) description.
In size, the series from Pátzcuaro is intermediate between
R. f. tenuis and R. f. toltecus but nearer the latter.



Reithrodontomys chrysopsis chrysopsis Merriam

Volcano Harvest Mouse; Spanish, Ratón Dorado


Reithrodontomys chrysopsis Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
13:152, June 13, 1900, type from Mount Popocatepetl, México.

Reithrodontomys chrysopsis chrysopsis, Howell, N. Amer. Fauna, 36:66,
June 5, 1914.


Range.&mdash;Patambán, 1,200 feet elevation as now known.


Remarks.&mdash;Howell (1914:68) lists nine specimens from Patambán.
We have not examined these specimens. He listed at the same
time seven of the specimens from Tancítaro, but we have found
specimens from Tancítaro to be of another subspecies, R. c. seclusus.
Accordingly, we are in doubt as to whether the mice from Patambán
are subspecies chrysopsis, seclusus, or an unnamed subspecies and
our use here of the name Reithrodontomys chrysopsis chrysopsis
for them is, of course, provisional.



Reithrodontomys chrysopsis seclusus Hall and Villa

Volcano Harvest Mouse; Spanish, Ratón Dorado


Reithrodontomys chrysopsis seclusus Hall and Villa, Proc. Biol. Soc.
Washington, 62: 163, August 23, 1949, type from Mount Tancítaro, 7,800 ft.,
Michoacán.

Reithrodontomys chrysopsis chrysopsis, Howell, N. Amer. Fauna, 36:66,
June 5, 1914, part.


Range.&mdash;Known only from Mount Tancítaro, from 6,000 feet elevation up
to at least 11,000 feet.

Specimens examined, 22: nos. 51407-51411, 52110-52126, all from Mount
Tancítaro, distributed by altitude as follows: 6,000 ft., 5; 7,800 ft., 10; 10,500
ft., 1; 11,000 ft., 1; no altitude recorded, 5.


Remarks.&mdash;The 22 specimens in the Chicago Natural History
Museum are remarkably uniform in color in spite of differences in
age; 17 are so young as to have the first upper molar only slightly
worn and 5 are adults. In preparing the original description of
R. c. seclusus, known only from specimens in the summer pelage,
comparison of color was made with only the winter pelage of R. c.
chrysopsis and it was pointed out that the differences noted in color
between the two subspecies might be seasonal rather than subspecific.
A summer specimen of R. c. chrysopsis (K. U. 17980,
taken on June 15, 12 km. ESE Amecameca, 11,500 ft.), is available
as the present account is being written. In direct comparison with
the original material of R. c. seclusus, all in summer pelage, and[460]
in comparison with a specimen of R. c. chrysopsis in winter pelage
(January 18), from 30 km. E Amecameca, the summer pelage of no.
17980 is more blackish than the winter pelage and therein more
closely resembles that of R. c. seclusus. The same is true of the
more sparsely haired tail. The ears, however, are blackish as in
winter-taken R. c. chrysopsis. This feature and also the large size
and different cranial proportions of specimen no. 17980 are in accordance
with the differences between R. c. chrysopsis and R. c.
seclusus as recorded in the original description of the latter.



Baiomys taylori analogus (Osgood)

Northern Pygmy Mouse; Spanish, Ratón Pigmeo Norteño


Peromyscus taylori analogus Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 28:256, April
17, 1909, type from Zamora, Michoacán.

Baiomys taylori analogus, Miller, N. Amer. Land. Mamm., 1911, p.
137, December 31, 1912.


Range.&mdash;Northwestern part of state.

Specimens examined, 35: nos. 100331-100365, distributed by localities as follows:
8 mi. N Zamora, 5,500 ft., 2; 11 mi. W Zamora, 5,750 ft., 1; 6&#189; mi. W
Zamora, 5,950 ft., 2; 4 mi. W Zamora, 5,450 ft., 1; 3 mi. NW Pátzcuaro, 6,700
ft., 21; 3 mi. N Pátzcuaro, 6,800 ft., 5; 2 mi. W Pátzcuaro, 6,700 ft., 3.


Remarks.&mdash;Osgood (1909:257) has recorded this subspecies also
from Acámbaro and Los Reyes. We found that these animals got
caught in our traps almost as often in the daytime as at night and
concluded that they were less nocturnal, or at any rate more diurnal,
than any of the other cricetine mice at the places in Michoacán
where we trapped.



Baiomys musculus musculus (Merriam)

Tropical Pygmy Mouse; Spanish, Ratón Pigmeo Tropical


Sitomys musculus Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 7:170, September
29, 1892, type from Colima, Colima.

Peromyscus musculus, Allen and Chapman, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat.
Hist., 9:203, June 16, 1897.

Baiomys musculus, Mearns, U. S. Nat. Mus. Bull., 56:381, April 13,
1907.


Range.&mdash;Dry, tropical, southwestern parts of state.

Specimens examined, 41: nos. 100366-100406; distributed by localities as follows:
1&#190; mi. S Tacámbaro, 5,700 ft., 1; 1 mi. E and 2&#189; mi. S Tacámbaro,
4,700 ft., 11; 4 mi. S and 1 mi. E Tacámbaro, 10; 1 mi. E and 5 mi. S Tacámbaro,
4,000 ft., 1; 6 mi. S Tacámbaro, 4,000 ft., 4; 1 mi. E and 6 mi. S Tacámbaro,
4,000 ft., 14.


Remarks.&mdash;Osgood (1909:258) has recorded this subspecies also
from La Huacana and La Salada. Three adult males with much
worn teeth weigh, in grams, 8.3, 9.3, and 10.8. Weights of three
adult, nonpregnant, females are 8.1, 9.4, and 9.7. None of our 13
females was pregnant.[461]



Peromyscus maniculatus labecula Elliot

Deermouse; Spanish, Ratón Cuatralvo


Peromyscus labecula Elliot, Field Columb. Mus., zoöl. ser., 3:143,
February (March?), 1903, type from Ocotlan, Jalisco.

P[eromyscus]. s[onoriensis]. labecula, Osgood, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
17:57, March 21, 1904.


Range.&mdash;Northwestern part of state.

Specimens examined, 59: nos. 51402-51406, 52175, 52176, 100407-100447,
100484; and 1366-1368, 1370-1372, 1374-1377, of Bernardo Villa R., distributed
by localities as follows: Tancítaro, 7; 11 mi. W Zamora, 5,750 ft., 3; 2 mi. W
Pátzcuaro, 7,700 ft., 4; 3&#189; mi. S Pátzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 2; 4 mi. S Pátzcuaro,
7,800 ft., 3; 5 mi. S Pátzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 24; 9 mi. SE Pátzcuaro, 8,000 ft., 6;
1&#189; km. N San Juan, 2,250 M., 3; 1 km. NNE San Juan, 2,250 M., 7.


Remarks.&mdash;The zygomatic arches are less widely flaring in specimens
from Tancítaro than in those from Pátzcuaro.



Peromyscus perfulvus Osgood

Marsh Mouse; Spanish, Ratón Breñero


Peromyscus perfulvus Osgood, Jour. Mamm., 26:299, November 14,
1945, type from 10 kilometers west of Apatzingan, 1,040 ft., Michoacán.


Range.&mdash;Known only from the semitropical Life-zone in western Michoacán.

Specimens examined, 5: nos. 100593, 100595, 100597, 100598, and 100600, all
from 1 mi. E and 6 mi. S Tacámbaro, 4,000 ft.


Remarks.&mdash;J. R. Alcorn took these specimens between fields of
sugar cane in tall (5 ft. high) grass growing in a belt 10 feet or so
wide along side a stream, which a person could step across. The
one adult, no. 100597, was recognized at the time of capture as
different from any other species known to us, by reason of the long,
unicolored, sparsely-haired tail and nearly clear Cinnamon Rufous
color above, white underparts, white feet, and dark brown ears. The
four other specimens in darker immature pelage are plumbeous and
cinnamon whereas immature individuals of comparable age of
Peromyscus banderanus caught in the same place are plumbeous
above and lack the cinnamon color. The immature animals of the
two species differ in color more than do the adults. Osgood (1945:300)
has recorded eleven specimens from the type locality. Our
one adult weighs 52.4 grams.



Peromyscus boylii evides Osgood

Brush Mouse; Spanish, Ratón de Chaparral


Peromyscus spicilegus evides Osgood, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
17:64, March 21, 1904, type from Juquila, Oaxaca.

Peromyscus boylei evides Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 28:152, April 17,
1909.


Range.&mdash;Northern part of state.

Specimens examined, 22: nos. 100450-100471, distributed by localities as fol[462]lows:
1&#189; mi. SSE Tacámbaro, 5,700 ft., 16; 1&#190; mi S Tacámbaro, 5,700 ft.,
1; 1 mi. E and 2&#189; mi. S Tacámbaro, 4,700 ft., 5.


Remarks.&mdash;Osgood (1909:153) recorded 31 specimens from Los
Reyes. Weights recorded by the collectors of our specimens for
13 males from the vicinity of Tacámbaro, are 24.8 (17.2-37.1) and
for 9 females 25.0 (20.0-31.5) grams. These weights include those
of subadults as well as those of adults.



Peromyscus boylii levipes Merriam

Brash Mouse; Spanish, Ratón de Chaparral


Peromyscus levipes Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 12:123,
April 30, 1898, type from Mount Malinche, Tlaxcala.

Peromyscus boylei levipes, Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 28:153, April 17,
1909.


Range.&mdash;Probably central-eastern part of state.


Remarks.&mdash;Osgood (1909:155) records one specimen of this subspecies
from Pátzcuaro.



Peromyscus hylocetes Merriam

Woods Mouse; Spanish, Ratón Ocotero


Peromyscus hylocetes Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 12:124,
April 30, 1898, type from Pátzcuaro, 7,000 feet, Michoacán; Osgood, N.
Amer. Fauna, 28:159, pl. 3, fig. 8, April 17, 1909.


Range.&mdash;Mountainous parts of state.

Specimens examined, 24: nos. 100472, 100542, both from 9 mi. SE Pátzcuaro
at 8,000 feet altitude; 1358-1365 of Bernardo Villa R., from Cerro Curitzarán,
3.5 km. NNW San Juan, 2,200 M.; 52178, 52185, 52187-52192, 52197, 52198,
52203, 52213-52215, from Tancítaro at elevations of 6,000 to 10,000 ft.


Remarks.&mdash;All of the specimens were taken in pine forest. The
old male from nine miles southeast of Pátzcuaro weighs 43.7 grams
and the younger male from there 35 grams. The adults from
Tancítaro have longer diastemae and some have the braincase more
prolonged posteriorly, than in specimens from the vicinities of San
Juan and Pátzcuaro but individual variation is considerable and we
are unable to differentiate some of the adults from Tancítaro from
those from elsewhere.



Peromyscus truei gratus Merriam

Piñon Mouse; Spanish, Ratón Piñonero


Peromyscus gratus Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 12:123, April
30, 1898, type from "Tlalpam," D. F.

8702, 8703, 8896, 8897, distributed by localities as follows: 8 mi. N Zamora,
5,500 ft., 2; 11 mi. W Zamora, 5,750 ft., 11; 6&#189; mi. W Zamora, 5,950 ft., 4;
6 mi. W Zamora, 5,950 ft., 4; Rio Duaro, 9 mi. E Zamora, 5,500 ft., 1; 3 mi. N
Pátzcuaro, 6,800 ft., 1; 3 mi. NW Pátzcuaro, 6,700 ft., 10; 1&#189; mi. NW
Pátzcuaro, 6,700 ft., 1; 2 mi. W Pátzcuaro, 6,700 ft., 3; Pátzcuaro (Chicago Nat.
Hist. Mus.), 5.


Remarks.&mdash;The ear measured from the notch is shortest, 19 (18-21),
at Zamora, intermediate, 21 (19-23), at Pátzcuaro, and longest,
21.8 (20-23), at the type locality of gratus in the Valley of México.



Peromyscus melanophrys zamorae Osgood

Blackish Mouse; Spanish, Ratón Obscuro


Peromyscus melanophrys zamorae Osgood, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
17:65, March 21, 1904, type from Zamora, Michoacán; N. Amer.
Fauna, 28:187, April 17, 1909.


Range.&mdash;Northern part of state.


Remarks.&mdash;Insofar as we know, this mouse has been taken in
Michoacán only at the type locality.



Peromyscus banderanus banderanus Allen

Tarascan Mouse; Spanish, Ratón Tarasco


Peromyscus banderanus Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 9:51,
March 15, 1897, type from Valle de Banderas, Nayarit; Osgood, Jour.
Mamm., 26:300, November 14, 1945.

Peromyscus banderanus vicinior Osgood, N. Amer. Fauna, 28:209, 210,
April 17, 1909, part.


Range.&mdash;Northern and eastern parts of state.


Remarks.&mdash;Specimens from Los Reyes referred to the subspecies
P. b. vicinior by Osgood (1909:209-210) were later characterized
by Osgood (1945:300) as agreeing with specimens from Zitácuaro,
and Osgood (loc. cit.) thought that those from both Los Reyes and
Zitácuaro were not P. b. vicinior but possibly P. b. banderanus. He
had this material set aside for further study when he showed it to
one of us (Hall) in 1945. It was his intention to revise the entire
species (P. banderanus) but so far we know never did this before
his death.



Peromyscus banderanus vicinior Osgood

Tarascan Mouse; Spanish, Ratón Tarasco


Peromyscus banderanus vicinior Osgood, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
17:68, March 21, 1904, type from La Salada, Michoacán.


Range.&mdash;Hot valleys of western part of state.

Specimens examined, 53: nos. 100543-100592, 100594, 100596, 100599, distributed
by localities, from Tacámbaro, as follows: 2&#189; mi. S and 1 mi. E,
[464]
4,700 ft., 21; 4 mi. S and 1 mi E, 4,500 ft., 10; 6 mi. S, 4,000 ft., 6; 6 mi. S and
1 mi. E, 4,000 ft., 16.


Remarks.&mdash;There is much variation in size in our animals. The
three largest males weigh, in grams, 67.5, 50.3, 48.9 and corresponding
figures for the two heaviest, nonpregnant, females are 53.5 and
48.3 grams. Of the 14 adult females, only one was recorded as
having embryos; it had two embryos each 24 millimeters in crown
to rump length. Where we trapped among big boulders and among
the roots of trees of the genus Ficus, Peromyscus banderanus vicinior
was the only species of the genus taken. Peromyscus boylii
evides occurred in the less tropical vegetation, altitudinally and
zonally above P. b. vicinior.



Peromyscus melanotis Allen and Chapman

Black-eared Deermouse; Spanish, Ratón Montañero


Peromyscus melanotis Allen and Chapman, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat.
Hist., 9:203, June 16, 1897, type from Las Vigas, 8,000 ft., Veracruz.


Range.&mdash;Higher mountains throughout state.

Specimens examined, 33: nos. 51397-51401, 52142-52166, 52172-52174, from
Tancítaro.


Remarks.&mdash;The elevation recorded on the label of one specimen
is 9,000 feet and on the labels of other specimens is no lower than
10,500 feet and on some is as high as 12,000 feet. The elevation of
capture is not recorded for two specimens. Osgood (1909:112)
previously recorded the species from 12,000 feet elevation on Mount
Tancítaro.



Oryzomys couesi regillus Goldman

Tropical Rice Rat; Spanish, Rata Arrocera Tropical; Tarascan word
for rat is Jeyáquihuiri (Hayakewire), or Sarisi


Oryzomys couesi regillus Goldman, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 28:129,
June 29, 1915, type from Los Reyes, Michoacán; Goldman, N. Amer.
Fauna, 43:37, September 23, 1918.


Range.&mdash;Plateau region of Northeast Michoacán.

Specimens examined, 22: nos. 100601-100622, distributed by localities as follows:
1 mi. N Zamora, 5,450 ft., 2; 4 mi. W Zamora, 5,450 ft., 1; 4 mi. S
Pátzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 1; 1 mi. E and 6 mi. S Tacámbaro, 4,000 ft., 18.


Remarks.&mdash;The tooth-row is longest in the specimens from Zamora,
shortest in those from Tacámbaro and intermediate in length
in the one specimen from Pátzcuaro. The shorter tooth-row at the
lower elevation (Tacámbaro), we interpret as intergradation with
Oryzomys couesi mexicanus. In color the specimens from Tacámbaro
are, to us, indistinguishable from those from Zamora and
Pátzcuaro but the color is notably darker than that of specimens
from the vicinity of Apatzingan which are here referred to the subspecies
[465]
Oryzomys couesi mexicanus. The largest male, fully adult
from Zamora weighs 82.9 grams and the largest one from the
vicinity of Tacámbaro weighs 73.6 grams.



Oryzomys couesi mexicanus Allen

Tropical Rice Rat; Spanish, Rata Arrocera Tropical


Oryzomys mexicanus Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 9:52, March
15, 1897, type from Hacienda San Marcos, 3,500 ft., Tonila, Jalisco.

Oryzomys couesi mexicanus, Goldman, N. Amer. Fauna, 43:33, September
23, 1918.

Specimens examined, 14: nos. 52018-52023, 52063-52070, from 1,040 ft., 10
kms., W Apatzingan.


Remarks.&mdash;These specimens are notably paler and have shorter
tooth-rows than those referred to O. c. regillus.



Oryzomys fulvescens lenis Goldman

Fulvous Rice Rat; Spanish, Rata Arrocera Pigmea


Oryzomys fulvescens lenis Goldman, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
28:130, June 29, 1915, type from Los Reyes, Michoacán; N. Amer. Fauna,
43:91, September 23, 1918.


Range.&mdash;Semitropical parts of state.


Remarks.&mdash;The type and one topotype so far as we know are the
only specimens of this species to have been obtained from the state.
The size is hardly larger than that of a large Reithrodontomys.



Sigmodon melanotis Bailey

Fulvous Cotton Rat; Spanish, Rata Algodonera Leonada


Sigmodon melanotis Bailey, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 15:114, June
2, 1902, type from Pátzcuaro, 7,000 ft., Michoacán.


Range.&mdash;Central Michoacán, as now known.

Specimens examined, 8: nos. 100623-100626, 52089-52092, distributed by localities
as follows: 2 mi. W Pátzcuaro (7,400 and 7,700 ft.), 2; 3&#189; mi. S
Pátzcuaro, 7,800 ft., 2; Tancítaro, 6,000 ft., 4.


Remarks.&mdash;This species was taken along with the species S.
hispidus two miles west of Pátzcuaro, and can be easily distinguished
from the latter by the dark reddish as opposed to grayish color of
the upperparts and by the shorter hind foot (less instead of more
than 32.5 mm.).



Sigmodon hispidus mascotensis Allen

Hispid Cotton Rat; Spanish, Rata Algodonera Setosa


Sigmodon mascotensis Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 9:54, March
15, 1897, type from San Sebastián, near Mascota, Jalisco.

Sigmodon hispidus mascotensis, Bailey, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
15:108, June 2, 1902.

[466]


Range.&mdash;Larger part of state.

Specimens examined, 4: nos. 100629, 3 mi. N Pátzcuaro, 6,700 ft.; 100630, 2
mi. W Pátzcuaro, 7,700 ft.; 100632, 1&#190; mi. S Tacámbaro, 5,700 ft.; 100631, 6 mi.
S and 1 mi. E Tacámbaro, 4,000 ft.


Remarks.&mdash;Bailey (1902:109) records a "very large" specimen
from Queréndaro. Our specimens have shorter molariform tooth-rows
than do those from nearer the type locality, for example, those
from Tuxpan, Las Canoas, and Artenkiki, all three places in Jalisco.



Sigmodon hispidus atratus Hall

Hispid Cotton Rat; Spanish, Rata Algodonera Setosa


Sigmodon hispidus atratus Hall, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 62:149,
August 23, 1949, type from 6&#189; mi. W Zamora, 5,950 ft., Michoacán.


Range.&mdash;Known only from Zamora and the type locality.

Specimens examined, 2: nos. 100628 (the holotype), 6&#189; mi. W Zamora, 5,950
ft.; 120268 (U. S. Nat. Mus., Biol. Surveys Coll.), Zamora.


Remarks.&mdash;When the present account first was prepared our specimen
from six and a half miles west of Zamora was tentatively referred
to S. h. mascotensis. Subsequently a second specimen, from
Zamora, was found. It agreed with the specimen from six and a
half miles west of Zamora. Inasmuch as the second specimen agrees
with the first and since each of the two differs from any previously
described kind, a name and description were published in time to be
inserted in the present account. From S. h. mascotensis, S. h. atratus
differs in shorter hind foot, darker upper parts, more densely haired
tail, shorter skull, more convex dorsal longitudinal outline of skull,
posteriorly constricted anterior palatine foramina instead of parallel-sided
foramina, and shorter and less decurved anterior process of
maxillary arm of zygoma.



Neotomodon alstoni alstoni Merriam

Volcano Mouse; Spanish, Ratón de Los Volcanes

7,800 ft., 5; 7,850 ft., 3; 10,000 ft., 4; 10,200 ft., 5; 10,500 ft., 1; 10,800 ft., 1;
11,000 ft., 2; 11,400 ft., 1.


Remarks.&mdash;The taking of specimens on Mount Tancítaro extends
the known geographic range of Neotomodon approximately 75 kilometers
to the southwestward; the westernmost locality previously
known was Nahuatzin, the type locality.


[467]


Nelsonia goldmani Merriam

Dwarf Wood Rat; Spanish, Rata Montera Minúscula


Nelsonia goldmani Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 16:80,
May 29, 1903, type from Mount Tancítaro, Michoacán.

the town of Pátzcuaro, as follows: 3&#189; mi. S, 7,900 ft., 9; 4 mi. S, 7,800 ft., 16;
5 mi. S, 7,800 ft., 26; 9 mi. SE, 8,000 ft., 8.


Remarks.&mdash;Of the 23 females, only one was pregnant. It had two
[468]
embryos. Average and extreme weights of ten adults of each sex,
are: males, 37.8 (31.5-48.2); females, 38.0 (31.0-48.6) grams. Our
specimens were trapped in well-defined runways beneath a rail
fence where there was a growth of grass sufficient to make a cover
for the runways. Bailey (1900:54-55) has recorded under the name
Microtus mexicanus phaeus specimens from Nahuatzin which may
be referable to the subspecies M. m. fundatus.



Mus musculus subsp.?

House Mouse; Spanish, Ratón Casero


Mus musculus Linnaeus, Systema Naturae, ed. 10, 1:62, 1758, type from
Upsala, Sweden.


Range.&mdash;Probably throughout state.

Specimens examined, 4: nos. 100696-100699, of which one is from Tacámbaro,
5,700 ft., and 3 are from 4 mi. S and 1 mi. E Tacámbaro, 4,500 ft.


Remarks.&mdash;In each of our specimens the belly is dark, approximately
as dark as the back. The specimens caught by us were
living in the wild; that is to say, they were not caught in and around
buildings. Elliot (1903:141) records the species from Pátzcuaro.



Rattus rattus alexandrinus (Geoffroy)

Black Rat; Spanish, Rata Negra


Mus alexandrinus Geoffroy, Catal. Mammif. du Mus. Nat. d'Hist.,
Paris, p. 192, 1803, type from Alexandria, Egypt.

R[attus]. rattus alexandrinus, Hinton, Jour. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc.,
26:63, December 20, 1918.

also from Pátzcuaro.

Specimens examined, 3: nos. 52027, 52033 from Tancítaro and 8909 from
Pátzcuaro.


Remarks.&mdash;These specimens answer well to the description of
R. r. alexandrinus except that no. 8909, taken in May, 1901, by F. E.
Lutz, has yellowish underparts suggestive of Rattus rattus frugivorous.
In the town of Tacámbaro we saw a freshly killed rat of this
species which was all black.



Sylvilagus floridanus subcinctus (Miller)

Florida Cottontail; Spanish, Conejo de Florida


Lepus floridanus subcinctus Miller, Proc. Acad, Nat. Sci. Philadelphia,

Remarks.&mdash;Nelson (1909:181) records specimens from Acámbaro,
Queréndaro and the type locality.


[469]


Sylvilagus floridanus restrictus Nelson

Florida Cottontail; Spanish, Conejo de Florida


Sylvilagus floridanus restrictus Nelson, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
20:82, July 22,1907, type from Zapotlán, Jalisco; Nelson, N. Amer. Fauna,
29:181, August 31, 1909.


Range.&mdash;Forested areas of non-tropical part of state except northeastern
part.


Remarks.&mdash;Nelson (1909:183) records specimens from Los Reyes,
Pátzcuaro and Mount Tancítaro. This species and the Mexican
cottontail are favorite small game for the rural peoples.



Sylvilagus cunicularis cunicularis (Waterhouse)

Mexican Cottontail; Spanish, Conejo Méxicano


Lepus cunicularis Waterhouse, Nat. Hist. Mammalia, 2:132, 1848, type
from Zacualpan (probably in state of México).

Sylvilagus cunicularis, Nelson, N. Amer. Fauna, 29:239, August 31,
1909.


Range.&mdash;Probably all of state except tropical coastal areas where another
subspecies of the same species probably will be found to occur.

Specimens examined, 2: nos. 51965, 51966, from Tancítaro, one specimen
labeled as taken at 6,000 feet altitude.


Remarks.&mdash;Nelson (1909:241) has recorded this rabbit also from
Pátzcuaro.



Lepus callotis Wagler

White-sided Jack Rabbit; Spanish, Liebre


Lepus callotis Wagler, Naturliches System der Amphibien, p. 23, 1830,
type from southern end of Mexican Tableland; Nelson, N. Amer. Fauna,
29:122, August 31, 1909.


Range.&mdash;Approximately northeastern half of state.


Remarks.&mdash;Nelson (1909:124) records specimens from Los Reyes
and Queréndaro; we did not see any animals of this species in our
own field work.



Tayassu angulatus humeralis Merriam

Collared Peccary; Spanish, Jabalí del Collar; Tarascan, cúchjerámba
(cucheramba) or Juáteanapu (whatalanapu)


Tayassu angulatus humeralis Merriam, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington,
14:122, July 19, 1901, type from Armería, Colima.


Range.&mdash;Approximately southwestern half of state.


Remarks.&mdash;Under date of October 11, 1948, Henry W. Setzer
(in litt.) states that four specimens of this species, in the Biological
Surveys Collection in the United States National Museum, were
taken at La Salada, by Nelson and Goldman, and bear catalogue
numbers 126156, 126157, 126158 and 126159. No. 126158 is a female
taken on March 19, 1903. The other three specimens are
[470]
males taken on March 17, 1903. We did not see any animals of
this species in our own field work, and the only materials from
Michoacán actually examined by one of us (Hall) are the skulls
of nos. 126156 and 126158, referred to above, from the Biological
Surveys Collection.



Odocoileus virginianus sinaloae Allen

White-tailed Deer; Spanish, Venado Cola Blanca; Tarascan,
Asúni (Ashumi)


Odocoileus sinaloae Allen, Bull. Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., 19:613, November
14, 1903, type from. Esquinapa, Sinaloa.


Range.&mdash;Probably statewide.


Remarks.&mdash;Through the courtesy of Dr. A. Remington Kellogg
we learn that in a manuscript on the deer of the Odocoileus virginianus
group, he and the late Major E. A. Goldman had recorded
specimens, in the Biological Surveys Collection of the United States
National Museum, as follows: Nahuatzin, 8,500 ft., nos. 35924/48232,
and 35925/48233; Los Reyes, 5,000 ft., no. 165673; Pátzcuaro,
7,000 ft., no. 35535/47819; and Uruapan, 4,500 ft., no. 13060. We
have not anywhere seen the name combination Odocoileus virginianus
sinaloae but from the original description we judge that
Odocoileus sinaloae is to be arranged as a geographic race of the
wide-ranging species Odocoileus virginianus as that species is now
understood.



Dasypus novemcinctus mexicanus Peters

Nine-banded Armadillo; Spanish, Armadillo; Tarascan, Isíngu (Esing&#335;)


Dasypus novemcinctus mexicanus Peters, Monatsber. k. preuss. Akad.

Fauna, 25:52, October 24, 1905, to the subspecies occurring at Colima).


Range.&mdash;Probably statewide.

Specimens examined, 2; nos. 51392 from Tancítaro and 51964 from Apatzingan,
1,040 ft.


Remarks.&mdash;The female from Tancítaro is immature as indicated
by the wide-open sutures between the bones of the skull which in
over-all length is only 72.8 mm. The male from Tancítaro is older
and the over-all length of the skull is 98.33 mm. Geographic considerations
alone are responsible for our use of the subspecific name
mexicanus; we do not know the morphological features which distinguish
mexicanus from other named subspecies.

Transcriber's Notes

On page 458, the
Reithrodontomys fulvescens inexspectatus Elliot also lists
Rhithrodontomys inexspectatus Elliot. Apparently the two genera
names (Reithrodontomys and Rhithrodontomys) are both 'correct' spellings
for Harvest Mice.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
