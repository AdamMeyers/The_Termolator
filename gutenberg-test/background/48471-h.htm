      PREFATORY NOTE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following attempt at a tragedy in fiction (a tragedy, however, without
      a tragic ending) must not be construed into an attack on the English
      priesthood generally. I have simply pictured, in the Rev. Charles Santley,
      a type of man which exists, and of which I have had personal experience.
      Fortunately, such men are uncommon; still more fortunately, the clergymen
      of, the English Establishment are for the most part sane and healthy men,
      too unimaginative for morbid deviations.

      CHAPTER I. ST. CUTHBERT'S.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s the sweet, clear
      voices of the surpliced choristers rose in the closing verse of the hymn,
      and the vicar, in his white robe and violet hood, ascended the pulpit
      steps, old Gabriel Ware, sexton and doorkeeper of St. Cuthbert's, limped
      across the pavement and slipped into the porch, as his custom was at
      sermon-time on Sunday afternoons.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited till the singing had ceased and the congregation had settled in
      their pews; and while he listened to the vicar announcing his text&mdash;"For
      in Him we live, and move, and have our being"&mdash;he fumbled in the
      pockets beneath his black gown of office, and then limped noiselessly out
      into the sunshine, where, after a glance round him, he pulled out a short
      clay pipe, well seasoned, filled it with twist, and began his usual
      after-dinner smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a hot, shimmering July afternoon, and it was much pleasanter to sit
      out of doors on a tombstone, listening to the vicars voice as it came
      though the dark lancets like a sound of running water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a mile or so away, nestled in trees, was the village of Omberley,
      with its glimpses of white walls and tiled or slated roofs. Then there
      were soft, hazy stretches of pasture, with idyllic groupings of cattle and
      sheep and trees. The fields of wheat and barley, turnips and potatoes, lay
      out idle and warm, growing and taking no care, and apparently causing
      none. The sight and smell of the land filled Gabriel with a stolid
      satisfaction at the order of nature and the providential gift of tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was but the faintest breeze stirring, and it wafted all manner of
      sweet odours and lulling whispers about the graveyard. Everywhere there
      was evidence of a fervent throbbing vitality and joyousness. The soft
      green turf which spread all round the church to the limits of the
      churchyard, here billowing over a nameless grave, here crusting with moss
      the base of a tombstone or a marble cross or a pillared urn, here edging
      round an oblong plot brilliant with flowers and hothouse plants,&mdash;the
      very turf seemed stirred by glad impulses, and quivering with a crush of
      hurrying insect life. Daisies and buttercups and little blue and pink eyed
      flowers danced among the restless spears of grass with a merry hardihood.
      Laburnums and sycamores stood drowsing in the hot shining air, but they
      were not asleep, and were not silent, A persistent undertone came from
      among their shadowy boughs, as if the sap were buzzing through every leaf
      and stalk. Up their trunks, toiling through the rugged ravines of the
      rough bark, travelling along the branches, flitting from one cool leaf to
      another, myriads of nameless winged and creeping things went to and fro,
      and added their murmurs to the vast, vague resonance of life. A soft,
      ceaseless whispering was diffused from the tall green spires of a row of
      poplars which Went along the iron railing that separated the enclosure
      from the high-road. Blue and yellow butterflies fluttered from one
      'flowery grave to another; the big booming humble-bee went blundering
      among the blossoms; a grasshopper was: singing shrilly in the bushes near
      the railing; a laborious caravan of ants was crossing the stony wilderness
      of the gravel path; a dragon-fly hawked to and fro beneath the sycamores;
      small birds dropped twittering on cross or urn for an instant, flashed
      away up into a tree, and then darted off into the fields, as though too
      full of excitement and gamesomeness to rest more than a moment anywhere.
      Soft fleecy masses of luminous cloud slumbered in the hot blue sky
      overhead, and only in its remote deeps did there seem to be unimpassioned
      quietude and a sabbath stillness&mdash;only there and in the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the dazzling sunshine and the heat, the church was cool
      and dim and fragrant. The black and red tiles of the pavement, the brown
      massive; pillars and airy arches of sandstone, the oaken pews, the
      spacious, sanctuary with, its wide, stone steps, affected one with a.
      refreshing sense of coolness and comfort. The light entered soft and
      subdued through richly stained glass, for the windows looked, not on
      familiar breadths, of English landscape glowing and ripening in the July
      sun, but seemed rather to open into the strangely coloured world of
      nineteen centuries ago. The blessing of the little children, the raising
      of Lazarus, the interview at the well with the woman of Samaria, the
      minstrel rout about the house of the ruler whose little maid lay not dead
      but sleeping, took the place of the mundane scenes beheld through
      unhallowed windows. Even the unpictured lancets were filled with leaded
      panes of crimson and blue and gold. Then there was a faint, pleasant odour
      of incense about the building, emphasizing the contrast between the mood
      of nature and the mood of man. St. Cuthberts was floridly ritualistic, and
      the vicar was one of those who felt that, in an age of spiritual disquiet
      and unbelief, a man cannot cling with too many hands to the great
      Revelation which appeared to be daily growing more elusive, and who
      believed that if the soul may be lost, it may also be, in a measure, saved
      through the senses. Feigned devotions and the absence of any appeal to the
      physical nature of man had, he was convinced, drawn innumerable souls into
      indifference on the one hand, and into Catholicism on the other. If there
      was a resurrection of the body as well as of the soul, surely the body
      ought not to be abandoned as a thing accursed, from which no good can
      come. The vicar encountered no difficulty in realize ing his views of the
      dignity of flesh and blood at St. Cuthbert's.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thick, softly toned carpet lay on the broad stone steps which led up to
      the communion table. Behind the communion table, and for some distance to
      right and left, the sanctuary walls were hung with richly coloured
      tapestry. The table itself&mdash;or the altar, as it was usually called&mdash;was
      draped with violet silk, embroidered with amber crosses, and upon it stood
      a large crucifix of brass, with vases of flowers, and massive brazen
      candlesticks on either side. In the centre a large brass gasalier was
      suspended from a large ring, containing an enamelled cross, and beneath it
      hung an oil-lamp, which was kept perpetually burning. Amid all the
      coolness and fragrance and mystical flush of colour, that little leaf of
      flame floating in its glass cup attracted the attention of the stranger
      most singularly. It piqued the imagination, and added an indescribable
      feeling of hallowed sorcery to the general effect, which was that of an
      influence too spiritual not to excite reverence, but too sensuous to be
      considered sacred. Stepping out of the churchyard, with its throbbing
      warmth and glad undertones of commotion, into the cool, soft-lighted,
      artificially coloured atmosphere of the church, one might have felt as if
      dropped into the Middle Ages, but for the modern appearance of the
      congregation.
    </p>
    <p>
      St. Cuthbert's was the fashionable place of worship at Omberley, and its
      afternoon service was always well attended, though at a glance one
      perceived, from the chromatic effect of the pews, that the large majority
      of the congregation were of the more emotional sex. As the vicar gave out
      his text, his taste for the bright and beautiful must have been gratified
      by the flowers and feathers and dainty dresses, and still more by the rows
      of young and pretty faces which were raised towards the pulpit with such
      varied expression of interest, affection, and admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. Charles Santley had been Vicar of St. Cuthbert's for little less
      than a year. He was unmarried, just turned thirty, a little over the
      middle height, and remarkably handsome. It was not to be wondered at that,
      with such recommendations, the new vicar had at the very outset fascinated
      the maids and matrons of his congregation. A bright shapely face, with
      soft dark eyes, a complexion almost feminine in its clear flush, a broad
      scholarly forehead, black hair slightly thinned with study on the brow and
      at the temples, black moustache and short curling black beard,&mdash;such
      was the face of the vicar as he stood uncovered before you. His voice was
      musical and sympathetic; the pressure of his hand invited confidence and
      trust; his soft dark eyes not only looked into your heart, but conveyed
      the warmth and eagerness of his own; you felt instinctively that here you
      might turn for help which would never be found wanting, and seek advice
      that would never lead you astray, appeal for sympathy with a certainty
      that you would be understood, obey the prompting to transfer the burthen
      of spiritual distress with a sure knowledge that your self-esteem would
      never be wounded. Of course there were ladies of a critical and censorious
      disposition among his flock, but even these were forced to acknowledge the
      charm of his presence and the kindliness of his disposition. Among the men
      he was less enthusiastically popular, as was natural enough; but he was
      still greatly liked for his frankness and cordiality, and his keen
      intellect and sterling common sense commanded their respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one thing you might always reckon at St. Cuthbert's&mdash;a thoughtful,
      eloquent sermon, delivered in a voice full of exquisite modulations. It
      happened often enough that the preacher forgot the capacities of his
      hearers, and became dreamy and mystical; but, though you failed to
      comprehend, you were conscious that the fault lay less with him than with
      your own smaller spiritual nature. This, too, happened only in certain
      passages, and never throughout an entire discourse. He began on the grass,
      as the lark does, and gradually rose higher and higher in the brightening
      heavens till your vision failed; but, if you waited patiently, he
      descended again to earth, still singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this Sunday afternoon, preaching from the text in the Acts, he held his
      hearers spell-bound at the outset. Referring to the memorable discourse in
      which the text occurs, he conjured up before them Athens&mdash;glittering,
      garrulous, luxurious, profligate&mdash;the Athens St. Paul had seen. The
      vivid picture was crowded with magnificent temples, countless altars,
      innumerable shapes of mortal loveliness. Here was the Agora, with its
      altar of the Twelve Gods, and its painted cloisters, and its plane trees,
      beneath whose shade were disputing groups of philosophers, in the garb of
      their various sects. Gods and goddesses, in shining marble, in gold and
      ivory, caught the eye wherever it fell. There were altars to Fame and
      Health and Energy, to Modesty and Persuasion, to Pity and to Oblivion. On
      the ledges of the precipitous Acropolis glittered the shrines of Bacchus
      and Æscülapius, Venus, Earth, and Ceres. Over all towered the splendid
      statue of Pallas, cast from the brazen spoils of Marathon, visible, as it
      flashed in the sun, to the sailor doubling the distant promontory of
      Sunium. Every divinity that it had entered into the imagination of man to,
      conceive or the heart of man to yearn for, every deified attribute of
      human nature, had here its shrine or its voluptuous image. "Ye men of
      Athens, all things which I behold bear witness to your carefulness in
      religion." It was easier, said the Roman satirist, to find a god than a
      man in Athens. And yet these men, with all their civilization, with all
      their art and poetry and philosophy, had not found God, and,
      notwithstanding all the statues and altars they had erected, were aware
      that they had not found Him; for St. Paul, as he traversed their
      resplendent city, and beheld their devotions, had found an altar with this
      inscription, "<i>To the Unknown God.</i>" Referring then to those "certain
      philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoics," who encountered the
      apostle, he briefly sketched the two great systems of Greek speculation,
      and their influence on the morality of the age: the pantheism of the
      Stoics, who recognized in the universe a rational, organizing soul which
      produced all things and absorbed all things,&mdash;who perceived in
      pleasure no good, in pain no evil,&mdash;who judged virtue to be virtue
      and vice vice, according as they conformed to reason; the materialism of
      the Epicureans, who perceived in creation a fortuitous concourse of atoms,
      acknowledged no Godhead, or, at best, an unknowable, irresponsible
      Godhead, throned in happy indifference far beyond human imptration,&mdash;taught
      that the soul perished as the body perished, and was dissipated like a
      streak of morning cloud into the infinite azure of the inane. Following
      Paul as the philosophers "took him and brought him unto Areopagus," where
      from immemorial time the judges, seated on benches hewn out of the rock,
      had sat under the witnessing heavens, passing sentence on the greatest
      criminals and deciding the most solemn questions of religion, he glanced
      down once more at the city glittering with temples and thronged with gods
      and goddesses, and bringing into broad contrast the radiant Apollo and the
      voluptuous Aphrodite, with the scourged and thorn-crowned figure on the
      cross, he read the message of the apostle to the pagan world. On how many
      altars to-day might not the words "To the Unknown God" be fittingly
      inscribed! "In Him we live, and move, and have our being;" but how few of
      us have "felt after" and found Him! In a strain of impassioned eloquence
      the preacher spoke of that unseen sustaining presence, which brooded over
      and encompassed us; of the yearning of the human heart for communion with
      the Creator; of the cry of anguish which rose from the depths of our
      being, when our eyes ached with straining into the night and saw nothing,
      when our quivering hands were reached out into the infinite and clasped
      but darkness; of the intense need we felt for a personal, tangible,
      sympathetic Being, for an incarnation of the divinity; of those ecstatic
      ascensions of the soul, in which man "felt after" and actually touched
      God; and, as he spoke, his glowing words gradually ceased to convey any
      definite meaning to the great majority of his hearers: but one face,
      flushed with joyous intelligence, one young beautiful face, with large,
      liquid blue eyes of worship, and with eager tremulous lips, was all the
      while turned fixedly up to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated in a little curtained nook near the organ, a slim, fair girl of two
      and twenty watched the preacher with almost breathless earnestness. She
      was a bright little fragile-looking blossom of a being, who seemed
      scarcely to have yet slipped out of her girlhood. Her face was of that
      delicate white, tinged with a spot of pink, which so often indicates a
      consumptive constitution, but in her case this delicacy of complexion was
      owing rather to the fineness of the material of which nature had moulded
      her. Light fine hair, in silky confusion rather than curls, clustered
      about her forehead and temples. Her little hands still clasped the
      music-book from which she had been playing the accompaniment of the hymn&mdash;for
      Edith Dove was the organist of St. Cuthbert's&mdash;as though from the
      outset she had been too absorbed to remember that she was holding it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally the vicar turned towards the aisle in which she sat, and his
      glance rested on her for a moment, and each time their eyes met Edith's
      heart beat more rapidly, and a deeper tinge of rose-colour brightened her
      cheeks. But Mr. Santley showed no sign of kindred emotion; he was wholly
      absorbed in the fervid thoughts which flowed from his lips in such strains
      of exaltation. As his eyes wandered over the congregation, however, he
      suddenly saw another face which was turned attentively towards him, and
      which made him pause abruptly. He stopped in the midst of a sentence. He
      felt the action of his heart cease, and he knew that the blood was driven
      from his cheeks. He looked dazedly down at his manuscript, but was unable
      to find the place where his memory had failed him. For a few seconds there
      was dead silence in the church, and the eyes of the congregation were
      turned inquiringly towards the pulpit. Then, stammering and flushing, he
      resumed almost at haphazard. But the enthusiasm of the preacher had
      deserted him; his attention was distracted by a rush of recollections and
      feelings which he could not banish; the words he had written seemed to him
      foreign and purposeless, and it was only with a resolute effort that he
      constrained himself to read the parallel he had drawn between the
      pantheism and materialism of the days of St. Paul and those of our own
      time. To the close of his sermon he never once ventured to turn his eyes
      again in the direction of that face, but kept them fixed resolutely upon
      his manuscript. Not till he had descended the pulpit steps and was
      crossing the chancel, did he hazard a glance across the church towards
      that disquieting apparition.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the service was ended, and the choristers, headed by the
      cross-bearer, had passed in procession down the nave to the vestry, the
      vicar hastily disrobed and issued into the churchyard. As with a strange
      fluttering hopefulness he had half anticipated, he was being waited for. A
      lady was moving slowly about among the graves, pausing now and again to
      read an inscription on a stone, but keeping a constant observation on the
      church doors. As he came out of the porch, she advanced to meet him, with
      a smile upon the face which had so terribly disconcerted him. She was a
      most beautiful, starry-looking creature&mdash;a tall, graceful, supple
      figure, with the exquisitely moulded head of a Greek statue; a ripe rich
      complexion suffused with a blush-rose tint; large lovely black eyes full
      of fire and softness; long, curved, black eyelashes; a profusion of silky
      black hair parted in little waves on a broad, bright forehead; and a pair
      of sweet, red lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out a little white hand to him, and, as he took it, their first
      words were uttered simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ellen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Santley!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never dreamed," said the vicar, excitedly, "I never dared to hope, to
      see you again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the world is very small," she replied gaily, "and people keep
      crossing each other at the most unexpected times and in the oddest of
      places. But I am so glad to see you. Are you doing well? You can scarcely
      imagine how curious it was when I recognized you to-day. Of course I had
      heard your name as our vicar, but I had no idea it could be <i>you</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure you are not more glad than I am," rejoined the vicar. "Are you
      staying at Omberley? Have you friends here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She regarded him for a moment with a mixed expression of surprise and
      amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not know that I am one of your parishioners now?" she asked, with
      a pleasant laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked wonderingly into her dark, joyous eyes, and felt a sudden sense
      of chill and darkness within him, as a quick intelligence of who and what
      she now was flashed into his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you at the Manor?" he asked, in a low, agitated voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she answered, without noticing his emotion. "We arrived only
      yesterday, and have hardly had time yet to feel that we are at home; but I
      could not resist the inclination to see what sort of a church, and what
      sort of a vicar," she added, with a glance of sly candour, "we had at St.
      Cuthbert's. I am really so glad I came. Of course you will call and see us
      as soon and as often as you can, will you not? Mr. Haldane will be
      delighted, I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very kind," said the vicar, scarcely aware of what he was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, I wish to be so," she replied, smiling. "Of course you know Mr.
      Haldane?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting him. He&mdash;you had gone
      abroad before I came to Omberley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you have not been here long?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite a year yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you like the place&mdash;and the people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both, very much indeed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not married yet, I think Mr. Haldane said?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar looked at her with a sadness that was almost reproachful as he
      answered, "No; I have my sister living with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How pleasant! You <i>must</i> bring Miss Santley with you when you come,
      will you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke she moved slowly towards the gateway opening on to the road,
      where a little basket-carriage was awaiting her. He accompanied her, and
      for a few seconds there was silence between them. Then they shook hands
      again before she got into the carriage, and she repeated her assurance&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am so glad to have met you, Mr. Santley!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the reins, and, lightly flicking the ponies with the whip,
      flashed upon him a farewell smile from those dark, spiritual eyes and
      laughing lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar turned back into the churchyard, and following a narrow path
      that led across the sward through a wicket and a small beech plantation,
      entered the Vicarage with a pale, troubled face.

      CHAPTER II. AT THE VICARAGE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen he reached the
      house he found that his presence was needed at the bedside of a labourer,
      who had met with a serious accident a day or two before, and who was now
      sinking rapidly. Mr. Santley was a man who never begrudged time or trouble
      in the interests of his parishioners; and, though he had yet another
      service to attend, and was already fatigued by the work of the day, he
      readily signified his willingness to comply with the request of the dying
      man, and at once started for the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt at the moment that the duty placed before him would be a relief
      from the thronging recollections and the wild promptings which had set his
      heart and brain in a turmoil. As he went down the road, however, the face
      of the dying man who had sent to seek his priestly aid, and the face of
      the beautiful wife of the owner of Foxglove Manor, seemed to be striving
      for mastery over him; he was unable to concentrate his attention on any
      subject. His will was in abeyance, and he appeared to himself to be in a
      sort of waking nightmare, in which the most distorted thoughts of marriage
      and death, of a lost love and of a lost God, of the mockery of life, the
      mockery of youth, the mockery of religion, presented themselves before him
      in a hideous masquerade, till the function he was about to fulfil appeared
      to him at one moment a sacrilege and at another a degrading folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand in some degree the vicars mental condition, it is necessary
      to glance back on his past life. In early manhood Charles Santley had been
      seriously impressed with the sense of a special vocation to a religious
      life. He was the son of a wealthy merchant, whose entire fortune had
      perished in one of our great commercial crises, and whose death had
      followed close upon his ruin. Up to that period Charles had been undecided
      as to his choice of a pursuit; but the necessity of making an immediate
      selection resulted in his devoting himself to the Church. Barely
      sufficient had been saved from the wreck of their property to support his
      widowed mother and his sister. For himself, he was endowed with a splendid
      physique, a keen intellect, and indomitable energy; and he at once flung
      himself into his new career. He supported himself by teaching until he was
      admitted to orders, when he obtained a curacy, and eventually, through the
      interest of some old friends of his father, he was presented with the
      living of St. Cuthbert's. In the course of these years of struggle,
      however, there was gradually developing within the man a spirit which
      threatened to render his success worse than useless to him. Ardent,
      emotional, profoundly convinced of the eternal truths of revelation and of
      the glorious mission of the Church, the young clergyman was at the same
      time boldly speculative and keenly alive to the grandiose developments of
      the modern schools of thought. It was not till he stood on the extreme
      verge of science and looked beyond that he fully realized his position. He
      then perceived with horror that it was no longer impossible&mdash;that it
      was even no longer difficult&mdash;to regard the great message of
      redemption as a dream of the world, the glorious faith of Christendom as a
      purely ethnic mythology, morality as a merely natural growth of a natural
      instinct of self-preservation. Indeed, the difficulty consisted in
      believing otherwise. The Fatherhood of a personal God was slipping away
      from his soul; the Sonship of a Saviour was melting into a fantastic
      unreality; the conviction of a personal immortality was dissipating into
      mental mist and darkness. The mystery of evil was growing into a fiendish
      enigma; virtue passed him, and showed herself to be a hollow mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      His whole nature rose in revolt against this horrible scientific travesty
      of Gods universe. He shrank back alike from the new truths and from the
      theories evolved from them. His faith could not stand the test of the
      wider knowledge. If God were indeed a myth, immortality but a dream,
      virtue an unprofitable delusion, man simply a beast gifted with speech,
      better the old faith concerning all these&mdash;accepted though it were in
      despite of reason and in outrage of immortal truth&mdash;than the hideous
      simulacra of the new philosophy. He cast himself back upon the bosom of
      the Church; he clung to her as to the garment of God; but he was powerless
      to exorcise the spirit of scepticism. It rose before him in sacred places,
      it scoffed at his most earnest and impassioned utterances; he seemed to
      hear within himself cynical laughter as he stood at the bedside of the
      dying; when he knelt to pray it stood at his ear and suggested blasphemy;
      it converted the solemn light of the Church into a motley atmosphere of
      superstition; it stimulated his strong animal nature to the very bounds of
      self-restraint. Still, if he was unable to exorcise it, he had yet the
      strength to contend with and to master it. Precisely because he was
      sceptical he was rigid in outward doctrine, zealous for forms, and
      indefatigable in the discharge of his clerical functions. In his
      passionate endeavour to convince himself, he convinced his hearers and
      confirmed them in the faith in which he was himself unable to trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day the old conflict between the sacerdotal and the sceptical was
      complicated by new elements of spiritual discord. After seven years of
      hopeless separation, Charles Santley had once more stood face to face with
      the embodied dream and inspiration of his early manhood, and had found
      her, in the full lustre of her peerless womanhood, another man's wife.
      During those years he had, it was true, reconciled himself to what then
      had been forced upon him as the inevitable, and he had sternly set himself
      to master the problem of his existence, without any secret hope that in
      the coming years his success might bring her within his reach; but he had
      never forgotten her. She was to him the starry poetry of his youth. He
      looked back to the time when he had first known and loved her, as a sadder
      and a wiser world looks back to the Golden Age. The memory of her was the
      ghost of an ancient worship, flitting in a dim rosy twilight about the
      Elysian fields of memory, and, it being twilight, the fields were touched
      with a hallowed feeling of loss and a divine sentiment of regret. And now&mdash;oh,
      bitter irony of time and fortune!&mdash;now that, he had achieved success,
      now that all the old gulfs which had separated them were spanned with
      golden bridges, now that he might have claimed her and she might have been
      proud to acknowledge the claim, she once more crossed his life&mdash;a
      vision of beauty, a star of inspiration&mdash;and once, more he knew that
      she was hopelessly, infinitely more hopelessly than ever, raised beyond
      his seeking.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was detained so long at the bedside of the dying man that, by the time
      he had again reached the Vicarage, the bells were ringing for evening
      service and the western sky was ablaze with sunset. In the church the
      light streamed through the lancets and the painted casements, filling the
      air with motley breadths of glowing colour, and painting pillar and arch
      and the brown sandstone with glorious blazonry. Even in the curtained nook
      near the organ the space was flooded with enchanted lights, and Edith Dove
      sat beside the tall gilded instrument like a picture of St. Cecilia in an
      illuminated missal. In the pulpit the vicar stood as if transfigured. He
      spoke, too, as though he felt that this was the splendour of a new heaven
      opening upon a new earth, and the glad rustle of the trees in the cool
      breeze outside was the murmur of paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed," were the words of
      his text, and throughout the fervid exposition of the apostle's faith in
      the resurrection the sweet, blue eyes and the eager lips of the organist
      were turned towards the preacher. He seemed this evening, however, to be
      unconscious of her presence. He addressed himself entirely to the
      listeners in the pews in front of him, and never cast even a solitary
      glance towards the aisle where she sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close of the service Edith found Miss Santley waiting for her at
      the entrance. It had now been customary for several weeks past for Miss
      Dove to go over to the Vicarage on Sunday evening and remain to supper
      with Mr. Santley and his sister. They went slowly through the churchyard
      together, and took the little path which led to the house. They remained
      chatting at the wicket for a few moments, expecting the appearance of the
      vicar. When Mr. Santley issued from the church, however, he passed quickly
      down the gravelled walk to the high-road. He had thrown a rapid look
      towards the plantation, and had seen the young women, but he gave no
      indication of having observed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Charles is not coming!" exclaimed Miss Santley, with surprise, as
      she saw her brother; "he surely cannot be going down to Omberley again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is not going to Omberley, dear," said Edith, who had been watching for
      the vicar, and had been keen enough to notice the hasty glance he had cast
      in their direction; "he is going up the road."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then wherever can he be going to? And he had not had tea yet, poor
      fellow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Santley stepped a few paces back into the churchyard, and stood on
      tiptoe to catch a glimpse of him over the hedge; but the vicar had already
      passed out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind, dear," she said to Edith. "Shall we go in and have a little
      chat by ourselves? He may have some sick call or other, and he is sure to
      be back soon, or he would have told me where he was going. Come, you
      needn't look so sad," Miss Santley continued, as she observed the
      expression of her companion's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't think I was looking sad," replied Edith, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, you were; dreadfully," said Miss Santley, laughing in a bantering
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't think Mr. Santley is&mdash;is not quite well?" asked Edith,
      timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no; Charles is quite well, I am sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps he is displeased with something," said Edith, as if speaking to
      herself rather than to Miss Santley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a little fidget you are!" said her companion, taking the girl's arm.
      "I know what you are thinking of. I am sure he has no cause to be
      displeased with <i>you</i>, at any rate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope not," replied Miss Dove, brightening a little. "Only I felt a
      misgiving. You do feel misgivings about all sorts of things, don't you,
      Mary, without knowing why&mdash;a sort of presentiment and an uneasy
      feeling that something is going to happen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young people in love, I believe, experience feelings of that kind," said
      Miss Santley, with mock gravity, "Come in, you dear little goose, and
      don't vex your poor wee heart like that. He will be back before we have
      got half our talk over."
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar strode rapidly along the road until he reached the summit of a
      rising ground, from which he could see two counties spread out before him
      in fruitful undulations of field and meadow and woodland. The sunset was
      burning down in front of him. Far away in the distant landscape were soft
      mists of blue smoke rising from half-hidden villages, and here and there
      flashed points of brightness where the sun struck on the windows of a
      farmstead. On either hand were great expanses of yellowing corn swaying in
      the cool breeze and reddening in the low crimson light. He left the road,
      and passed through a gate into one of the fields. Following a footpath, he
      went along the hedge till he reached a stile. Here he was alone and
      concealed in a vast sea of rustling corn. He sat down on the top of the
      stile, and resting his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands,
      gazed abstractedly into the glowing west.
    </p>
    <p>
      A single word which escaped him betrayed the workings of his mind:
      "Married!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven years ago, when Charles Santley began his struggle in life, he
      obtained through a clerical friend a position as teacher of classics in a
      seminary for young ladies in a small sea-side town in a southern county.
      He found his new labour especially congenial. A handsome young professor,
      whose attention was fixed on the Church, and who purposed to devote
      himself to her service, was cordially-welcomed by the devout ladies who
      conducted the establishment. They were three sisters who had been
      overlooked in the wide yearning crowd of unloved womanhood, and who had
      turned for consolation to the mystical passions of religion. Under their
      care a bevy of bright young creatures were brought up as in the chaste
      seclusion of a convent. Their impressionable natures were surrounded by a
      strange artificial atmosphere of spiritual emotion; life shone in upon
      them, as it were, through the lancets of a-mediaeval ecclesiasticism, and
      their young hearts, breaking into blossom, were coloured once and for ever
      with those deep glowing tints.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was here that the young man, in the first dawn of the romance of
      manhood, met the beautiful girl who was now the wife of the owner of
      Foxglove Manor. She was then turned of seventeen, and had become aware of
      the first shy longings and sweet impulses of her nature. She was his
      favourite pupil, and sat at his right hand at the long table when he gave
      his lessons. He used her pen and pencil, referred to her books, touched
      her hand with his in the ordinary work of the lesson. Her clothes touched
      his clothes beneath the table. At times their feet met accidentally. She
      regularly put a flower in a glass of water before his place. All these
      trifles were the thrilling incidents of a delicious romance which the
      school-girl was making in her flurried little heart. He, too, was not
      insensible to the trifles which affected his passionate pupil. Her great
      dark eyes sent electric flashes through him. Her breath reached him
      sweeter than roses. Her beautiful dark hair rubbed against his shoulder or
      his cheek, and he tried to prevent the hot blood from flushing into his
      face. When their hands touched he could have snatched hers and kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellen Derwent was happily not a boarder at the establishment, but resided
      with her aunt. Her family were wealthy country people, and Ellen, who had
      been ailing for a little while, had been ordered to the sea-side for
      change of air. Early in the bright mornings, and after the day's schooling
      was over, Ellen wandered about the sea-shore or took long walks along the
      cliffs. Santley met her first by accident, and after that, though the
      meetings might still be called accidental, each knew that to-morrow and
      to-morrow and yet again to-morrow the same instinctive feeling&mdash;call
      it a divine chance or love's premonition&mdash;would bring them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! happy, radiant days by that glad sea and in the wild loveliness of
      those romantic cliffs! Oh, vision of flushed cheek and shining eyes, and
      sweet red lips and throbbing bosom! Oh, dim heavenly summer dawns, when
      the sea mists were just brightening, and the little birds were singing,
      and the sea-side town was still half asleep, and only two lovers were
      walking hand in hand along the green brow of the cliffs! Oh, sweet autumn
      twilights which the shining eyes seemed to fill with dark burning lustre!
      Oh, kisses, sweeter than ever pressed by woman's lips before or since! Oh,
      thrill of clasped hands and mad palpitations of loving bosoms!
    </p>
    <p>
      The swaying corn sounded like the sea as the breeze passed over it, and
      the-murmur broke the vicars reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Married!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Married? yes, married! The sweet secret could not be kept for ever, and
      when Miss Lilburn, Ellen's aunt, discovered it, she at once spoke to Mr.
      Santley. She did not oppose his suit&mdash;indeed, she liked him greatly,
      but love, after all, was no mere school-girl's dream. Was he in a position
      to make Ellen his wife? In any case, they must know about it at home. If
      Mr. Derwent approved, she would be most happy that Mr. Santley should
      visit her; but, in the meantime, it was only prudent that Ellen should
      discontinue these pleasant rambles.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never seen Ellen since, until her face made his heart stand still
      in the midst of his sermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar rose from the stile with clenched hands and set teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bitter, bitter!" he said, raising his face to the sky and shaking his
      head as though he saw above him an invisible face, and spoke half in
      exquisite pain, half in stoical endurance.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III. "THERE IS A CHANGE!"
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Edith and Miss
      Santley reached the Vicarage, they went into the parlour, which, besides
      having a western exposure, commanded to a considerable distance a view of
      the high-road along which the vicar had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I always think this is the pleasantest room in the house," said Miss
      Santley, as she drew an armchair into the recess of the open window, and
      Edith seated herself on the couch. "Charles prefers an eastern frontage,
      for the sake of the early morning, he says; but I am always. busy in the
      morning, so I suppose I like the afternoon light best, when I have a
      little time to sit and bask."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it natural, too," suggested Edith, "that men should prefer sunrise
      and women sunset? Men are so active and sanguine, and have so many
      interests to engage their attention, and women&mdash;well, as a rule&mdash;are
      such dreamers! Is it not almost constitutional?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when did you ever see me dreaming, may I ask?" inquired Miss Santley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no; you are not one of the dreamers," replied Edith, quickly. "You
      should have been called Martha instead of Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Insinuating that I am a bit of a busybody, eh?" said Miss Santley, with a
      sly twinkle of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know I did not mean to insinuate that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or that you had yourself chosen the better part, eh?" she continued
      gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith coloured deeply, and cast her eyes on the floor, while an expression
      of pain passed across her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, my dear, do not look hurt. You know that was only said in jest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot tell how such jests hurt me," replied the girl, her lips
      beginning to tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even between our two selves?" asked Miss Santley, taking Edith's hand
      gently and stroking it with both of hers. "You know, my dear little girl,
      how I love you, and how pleased I was when I discovered the way in which
      that poor little heart of yours was beating. You know that there is no one
      in the world whom I would more gladly&mdash;ay, or a thousandth part so
      gladly&mdash;take for a sister. Don't you, Edith? Answer me, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied the girl, letting her head hang upon her bosom, and feeling
      her face on flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And have I not tried to help you? I know Charles is fond of you&mdash;I
      am sure of that. I have eyes in my head, my dear, though they are not so
      young and pretty as yours. And I know, too, that a little while ago he was
      anxious to know what I would say if he should propose to take a wife. I
      shall be only too pleased when he makes up his mind. It will relieve me of
      a great deal of care and anxiety. And he could not in the wide world
      choose a better or a dearer little girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Santley was not ordinarily of a demonstrative disposition, but as she
      uttered those last words she drew Edith towards her and kissed her on the
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar's sister was some twelve years his senior. A stout, homely,
      motherly little woman, with plain but pleasing features, brown hair, a
      shrewd but kindly expression, clear grey eyes, and a firm mouth and chin,
      she was as unlike the Vicar in personal appearance as she was unlike him
      in character and temperament. This family unlikeness, however, had had no
      prejudicial effect on their mutual affection, though in Miss Santley's
      case it was the source of much secret uneasiness on her brother's account.
      As unimaginative as she was practical, she was at a loss to understand her
      brother's emotional mysticism and dreamy idealism; but her knowledge of
      human nature made her timorously aware of the dangers which beset the
      combination of a splendid physique with a glowing temperament which was
      almost febrile in its sensuous impulsiveness. She was spared the torture
      of sharing that darker secret of unbelief; but she was sufficiently
      conscious of the strong fervid nature of the vicar, to feel thankful that
      Edith had made a deep impression on him, and that when he did marry it
      would be a bright and congenial young creature who would be worthy of him
      and attached to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So why should it hurt you, if I do jest a little?" asked Miss Santley, as
      she kissed Edith. "Love cannot always be transcendental, otherwise two
      people will never come closely together. The best gift a couple of lovers
      can possess in common, is a capacity for a little fun and affectionate
      wit. Your solemn lovers are always misunderstanding each other, and
      quarrelling and making it up again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But we are not lovers yet, Mary," said Edith in a timid whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet, perhaps; but you will be soon, if I am capable of forming any
      opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, I don't know," Edith replied with a sigh; and her soft blue
      eyes filled with tears. Then raising her eyes imploringly to Miss Santley,
      and nervously taking her hand, she continued: "Oh, Mary, do not think me
      too forward and eager and unwomanly. Do not judge me too hardly. I know a
      girl should not give her heart away till she is asked for it. But I cannot
      help it&mdash;I love him&mdash;I love him so! I have done all I could to
      prevent myself from loving him, but it is no use&mdash;oh! it is no use."
    </p>
    <p>
      She burst into a paroxysm of passionate sobbing, and Miss Santley, without
      saying a word, put her arms about her and softly caressed her soft flaxen
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outburst was gradually subdued, and Edith, with a hot glowing face
      hidden on her friend's shoulder, was too ashamed to change her position.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you feel better now, dear? asked Miss Santley in a kindly voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mary, are you not ashamed of me&mdash;disgusted?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Santley replied in a woman's way with another kiss, and again fondled
      the girl's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause of a few moments, she gently raised her face and regarded it
      affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must come upstairs and wash away those tell-tales before he returns.
      And"&mdash;she added a little hesitatingly&mdash;"will you not trust me
      with the cause of all this trouble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid you will laugh at me, dear, it must seem such a foolish cause
      to you. And I know you will say it was all simply my fancy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know, dear, where I sit in church?" Edith began, nervously playing
      with the lace on Miss Santley's dress. "Well, he always used to turn twice
      or thrice in my direction during the sermon. I used to think he did it
      because he knew I was there. And he did it this afternoon. But in the
      evening he never looked once during the whole time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Santley began to smile in spite of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then when he came out of the church he saw you and me waiting for him&mdash;I
      saw him give one single sharp look&mdash;and then he went on as if he had
      not perceived us. He would not have gone away like that, Mary, if I had
      not been with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is that all?" inquired Mary as Edith paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it is quite enough," the latter replied sorrowfully. "It means
      that he is tired of me; he was displeased that I was with you; he did not
      want to speak to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear girl, all this is simply silly fancy; you will make your whole
      life miserable if you imagine things in this way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew you would say that; but you do not understand. I hardly understand
      myself; but I know what I say is true. You remember old Harry Wilson down
      in the village&mdash;he has a wooden leg, you know, but when there is
      going to be a bad change of weather, he says he can feel it in the foot he
      has lost; and he is always right. I think I am like him, dear; I have lost
      something, and it makes me feel when there is a change, long before the
      storm breaks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All this is nothing but nonsense, my little woman!" said Miss Santley
      reassuringly. "Come with me upstairs, and let us make ourselves
      presentable." When Edith had bathed her face, the two came downstairs
      again, but instead of returning to the parlour they went into the library.
      This was specially the vicar's room, and, more than any other, it
      indicated the tastes and character of its occupant. The whole house,
      indeed, was tinged with the mediaeval colouring of the church, and in all
      parts of it you came upon indications of the ecclesiastical spirit of the
      owner; but here the vicar had given fullest expression to his fancy, and
      the room had as much the appearance of an oratory as of a library. At one
      end a small alcove jutted out into the plantation, and the windows were
      filled with stained glass. On the walls hung several of Raphael's
      cartoons; on the mantelpiece stood, under glass, a marble group of The
      Dead Christ; the furniture, which was of carved oak, suggested the stalls
      in the chancel; the brass gasalier and brackets were of ecclesiastical
      design; and, lastly, the library shelves were solemnly weighted with long
      rows of theology, sermons, and Biblical literature in several languages.
      In a separate bookcase, which was kept locked, were gathered together a
      number of scientific works and volumes of modern speculative philosophy. A
      third bookcase was devoted to history, poetry, travels, and miscellaneous
      works. The great bulk of the library, however, was clerical, and the vicar
      had within arm's reach a fair epitome of all that the good men of all ages
      and many countries had discovered regarding the mystery of the world and
      the relationship of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one corner of the room stood a tall richly carved triangular cupboard
      of black oak, and it too, like the bookcase of science, was kept
      perpetually locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Edith entered the room her eyes fell upon it, and turning to her
      companion she asked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mary, have you discovered the skeleton yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied Miss Santley, with a laugh. "Charles is forgetful enough in
      some things, but he has never yet left the key in that lock. I once asked
      him what it was he concealed so carefully, but he refused to satisfy my
      curiosity; so I resolved to trust to chance and his carelessness. I have
      waited so long, however, that my curiosity has at last been tired out. I
      don't suppose, after all, it is anything worth knowing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why does he always keep this bookcase locked too? The books all look
      so fresh and new, and they are much more attractive than those dusty old
      fellows any one can look into. I should like to read several of those, one
      hears so much about them. There is Darwin, 'The Descent of Man'&mdash;I
      have read articles about that book in the magazines, and I know he
      believes Adam and Eve were apes in Paradise or something like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear, Charles would never allow you to read those books on any
      account. They are all dreadfully wicked and blasphemous. He only reads
      them himself to refute them and to be able to show how false and dangerous
      they are."
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith, who had approached the window, now suddenly started back, and a
      bright flush rose to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here is Mr. Santley, Mary! How pale and wearied he looks!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment or two later the vicar entered the library. At the sight of Miss
      Dove he paused for an instant, and then advancing, held out his hand to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You here, Miss Edith!" he said coldly. "How are you, and how is your
      aunt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not wait for an answer, but went to his writing-table and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women exchanged glances of surprise, and Edith's face grew sad and
      white.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you not well, Charles?" his sister asked, going up to him and looking
      solicitously into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not very well this evening," replied the vicar; "it is the weather,
      I think. If Miss Edith will excuse me, I think I will leave you and lie
      down. I feel tired."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose again abruptly, and Edith stood regarding him with large, wistful
      eyes. He moved towards the door, and then suddenly stopped and turned to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good evening," he said once more, holding out his hand and speaking in a
      cold, distant manner. "Present my compliments to your aunt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you will be well in the morning," said Edith, timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks. Yes; I expect I shall be all right again after a little rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and left her, and Miss Santley, glancing at her significantly,
      followed him to his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has over-exerted himself to-day," said Mary a little later, as she
      accompanied Miss Dove to the garden gate. "He had a sick call in the
      afternoon, and was unable to take his usual rest. You will excuse my not
      accompanying you home, will you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh certainly," said Edith. "I hope it is nothing serious. Would you not
      like to see Dr. Spruce? I can call, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He says he does not need the doctor; he knows what is the matter with
      him, and only requires rest. Good night, dear! I am so sorry I cannot go
      part of the way with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not think of that," said Edith, shaking hands. "It is not late, and
      you must not leave him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The sunset had lowered down to its last red embers, but it was still quite
      light as Edith turned away from the Vicarage gate. She proceeded slowly
      down the road towards the village for a few moments, and then paused and
      looked back. No one was on the road. Retracing her steps, she passed the
      Vicarage at a quick pace, and took the direction which the vicar had taken
      an hour before. Strangely enough, she stopped at the top of the rising
      ground where he had stopped; went through the same gate, into the same
      field, and, following the same path, reached the stile on which he had
      sat. Here she sat down, with the great sea of corn whispering and
      murmuring about her, and the distant landscape growing-gradually more and
      more indistinct in the bluish vapour of the twilight. Alone and hidden
      from observation, she sat on the step with her arms on the cross-bar of
      the stile and her head laid on them, weeping bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have lost something, and it makes, me feel when there is a change!"

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. GEORGE HALDANE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he low-lying
      landscape had vanished in the twilight, and the stars were twinkling in
      the clear blue sky before Edith rose, dried her eyes, and began to return
      homeward. The moon had risen, but had yet scarcely freed itself from the
      tops of the dark woods, through which it shone round and ruddy. As she
      passed the Vicarage, she paused and looked up at the windows. She felt
      prompted to steal quietly up to the door and inquire whether Mr. Santley
      was any better, but a fear arising from many causes held her back.
      Besides, the house was in darkness, and every one seemed to have retired
      to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Edith had been in the habit of visiting the Vicarage, this was the
      first occasion on which she had returned home alone. Unreasonable as she
      acknowledged the suspicion to be, she could not rid herself of the belief
      that Mr. Santleys indisposition had been, assumed as an excuse for
      avoiding her. She strove to convince herself that she was foolishly
      sensitive and jealous, to hope that the change in the vicars manner was
      but an illusion of her excited fancy, to feel confident that when she saw
      him to-morrow she would recognize how childish she had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Dove was exceedingly fond of music, and during the week she was
      accustomed to spend hours alone in the church, giving utterance to her
      thoughts, and feelings in dreamy voluntaries, which were the fugitive
      inspiration of the moment, or filling the cool, richly lighted aisles with
      the impassioned strains of Mozart, Haydn, and Mendelssohn. The sound of
      the organ could be heard at the Vicarage, and Mr. Santley had been in the
      habit of going into the church, and conversing with her while she played.
      It was with the hope that one of his favourite pieces would again bring
      him to her that, during the afternoon of the following day, Edith took her
      seat at the organ. With nervous, eager fingers she swept the key-board,
      and sent her troubled heart into the yearning anguish and clamorous
      impetration of the <i>Agnus Dei</i> of Haydn's No. 2. When she had
      finished she rested for a little, and glanced expectantly down the aisle;
      but no footstep disturbed the quiet of the place. She then turned to
      another of the vicar's favourites&mdash;a <i>Gloria</i> of Mozart's. The
      volumes of throbbing sound vibrated through the stained windows, and
      floated across the bright churchyard to the Vicarage; but Ediths hope was
      not realized. She played till she felt wearied, rather with the
      hopelessness of her task than with the physical exertion; but the
      schoolboy who blew the organ for her was exhausted, and when she saw how
      red and hot he looked, she closed the instrument and dismissed him. Every
      day that week she repeated her experiment, but her music had apparently
      lost its magical influence. The vicar never came. She called thrice to see
      Miss Santley, but each time he was away from home. Once she saw him in the
      village, and her heart began to beat violently as he approached; but they
      were on different sides of the street, and instead of crossing over to
      her, as he had always done hitherto, he merely smiled, raised his hat, and
      passed on. Sunday came round at length, and she looked forward with a sad,
      painful wonder to the customary visit in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bright, breezy sabbath morning, and the great limes and sycamores
      which buried Foxglove Manor in a wilderness of billowy verdure, rolled
      gladsomely in the sun, and filled the world with a vast sealike <i>susurrus</i>.
      On the stone terrace which ran along the front of the mansion the master
      of the Manor was lounging, with a cigar in his mouth, and a huge
      deer-hound basking at his feet; while in the shadow of the room his wife
      stood at an open French window, conversing with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Haldane was a tall, broad-shouldered, powerful man of about forty
      years of age. His face, especially in repose, was by no means handsome.
      His grave, large, strongly marked features expressed decision, daring, and
      indomitable force. His forehead was broad, and deeply marked with the
      perpendicular lines of long mental labour. The poise of his head suggested
      a habit of boldly confronting an opponent. His short hair and closely
      trimmed beard were touched with gray, and gave a certain keenness and
      frostiness to his appearance. A grim, self-sufficing, iron-natured man,
      one would have said, until one had looked into his bright blue-gray eyes,
      which lit up his strong, rugged face with an expression of frankness and
      dry humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Nell," he said at length, in answer to the persistent persuasion
      of his wife, "do not be cross. There are two things in the world which I
      abhor beyond all others: a damp church and a dry sermon. Invite your vicar
      as often as you please. I will do my best to entertain him; but do not
      press me to sit out an interminable farrago of irritating platitudes in a
      chilly, straight-backed pew."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I assure you, George, you will be charmed with him, if you will only let
      me prevail on you to come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why cannot you Christians dispense with incense, and allow smoking
      instead&mdash;at least during the sermon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Haldane made a little grimace of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would then have whole burnt offerings dedicated with a devout and
      cheerful heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "George, you are shockingly profane! I see it is no use urging you any
      further; but I did think you would have put yourself to even some little
      inconvenience for my sake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For your sake, Nell!" replied Mr. Haldane, laughing. "Why did you not say
      so sooner? You know I would do anything on those terms. Have I not often
      told you the married philosopher has but one moral law&mdash;to do his
      wife's will in all things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you will accompany me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a dear, good old bear," exclaimed Mrs. Haldane, slipping on to
      the terrace and caressing his head with both hands. "But you know you <i>are</i>
      a bear, and you will try for once to be nice and good-natured, will you
      not? And you will not be cold and cynical with him because he is ideal and
      enthusiastic? And if you do not acknowledge that he is a delightful
      preacher, and that the dear little church is charming&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not ask me to go again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was going to say that, but it will be wiser to make no promises. You
      know, dear, you should go to church, if it were only for the sake of
      giving a good example; and it is my duty to try and persuade you to go.
      And oh, George, seriously I do wish you could feel that it drew you nearer
      to God; that where two or three are gathered together, He is in the midst
      of them. Now, do not smile in that hard, derisive way. I know I cannot
      argue with you, but if I cannot reply to your reasoning, you cannot
      convince my heart. I do believe, in spite of all logic, that I have a
      heavenly Father who loves and watches over me and you too, dear; and I
      should be wretched&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear little woman," said Mr. Haldane, taking both her hands in one of
      his, "you have no cause to be wretched. I have no wish to deprive you of
      your belief in a heavenly Father. With women the illusions of the heart
      last longer than with men; and perhaps, in these days of change and
      innovation, it is as well that women have still a creed to find comfort
      in. For my part, I confess I hardly understand what it is attracts you in
      your religion. The civilized world, so far as I can see, has outgrown the
      golden age of worship, and <i>latria</i> is one of the lost arts."
    </p>
    <p>
      The presence of the master of Foxglove Manor created considerable surprise
      and curiosity among the congregation at St. Cuthbert's. Though he had
      lived in the neighbourhood for the last twelve years, this was the first
      time he had been seen inside a church. Much more attention was paid during
      the service to the beautiful lady of the Manor, and the grim, powerful man
      who sat beside her, than was in keeping with the sacred character of the
      occasion. Mr. Haldane, on his part, though he did his best by imitating
      the example of his wife to conform to the ritual, was keenly critical of
      the whole service. The dim religious light of the painted windows pleased
      his eye, but failed to exercise any influence on his feelings. The
      decorations of the church seemed to him insincere and artificial. He
      missed in the atmosphere that sense of reverence which he had experienced
      in the old cathedrals in Spain and Italy. The ceremonies appeared dry,
      joyless, and uninteresting, and as he watched the congregation bowing,
      kneeling, praying, singing, pageants of the jubilant mythic worship of the
      ancient world crowded upon his imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you thinking of?" his wife once whispered, as she caught a
      sidelong glance at his abstracted face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Diana at Ephesus!" he replied, with a curious twinkle in his keen gray
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice during the sermon a saturnine smile passed across his face,
      and Mrs. Haldane pressed his foot by way of warning; but otherwise he
      listened gravely throughout, with his large, strongly marked features
      turned to the preacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, have you been interested, dear?" asked Mrs. Haldane, when the
      service was over, and they were waiting in the churchyard for the vicar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he replied drily; "your vicar is interesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, what do you mean by that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will repay study, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Haldane looked sharply into her husband's face, but was dissatisfied
      with her scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't like him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no reason yet to like or dislike him. In a general way, I should
      prefer to say that I do like him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what do you mean by your remark that he will repay study?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you will not understand me," he answered thoughtfully. "Your
      vicar has a soul, Nell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So have we all, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At least he believes he has one," said Mr. Haldane, with a slight shrug
      of his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he is trying to save it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We all are, I hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, Nell; the phenomenon in these days is a psychological
      rarity, and, being rare, is naturally interesting. It is one of the
      obscure problems of cerebration. Ah! here comes your vicar."
    </p>
    <p>
      With a bright smile Mrs. Haldane advanced to meet him, and cordially shook
      hands with him. "You must allow me to introduce you to my husband. George,
      Mr. Santley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My wife tells me," said Mr. Haldane, as they shook hands, "that she was
      an old pupil of yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the vicar, with an uneasy glance towards her, "many years
      ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a little curious," continued Mr. Haldane, "how people lose sight of
      each other for years, and then are unexpectedly thrown together into the
      same small social circle, after they have quite forgotten each others
      existence."
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar winced at the last words, but replied with a faint smile, "The
      great world is, after all, a very little world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my dear sir, I see I have started a familiar train of thought&mdash;the
      littleness of the world," said Mr. Haldane, with a dry light in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you fear I may improve the occasion?" asked the vicar a little
      coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray do not misunderstand my husband," interposed Mrs. Haldane. "He was
      delighted with your sermon to-day; and I do not wonder, for you have the
      power of appealing to the heart and raising the mind beyond earthly
      things. It was only a few moments ago that he told me he was deeply
      interested."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I perceived that he was amused once or twice," replied the vicar, with a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I confess that I may have smiled at one or two points in your discourse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse my interrupting you," said Mrs. Haldane; "will you not walk? You
      can spare time to accompany us a little way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Santley bowed, and Mrs. Haldane signed to the coachman to drive on
      slowly towards the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For example," resumed Mr. Haldane, "I see you still stick to the old
      chronology and the mythic Eden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet you should be aware that at least a thousand years before the
      date you fix for the creation of Adam, tribes of savage hunters and
      fishers peopled the old fir-woods of Denmark, and set their nets in the
      German Ocean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may eventually prove necessary to revise the chronology of the Bible,"
      replied the vicar; "but there is at present too much conflict of opinion
      among your archaeologists to decide on the absolute age of these tribes.
      After all, the question is one of minor importance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Granted. But you cannot say the same of the efficacy of prayer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Haldane laid her hand on her husband's arm, and stopped abruptly.
      "Ask Mr. Santley to dinner, George, and then you can discuss as long and
      as profoundly as you like; but I will not allow you to argue now. Besides,
      I want to talk to Mr. Santley."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Haldane laughed good-naturedly. "Just as you please, my dear. If Mr.
      Santley will favour us with his company, I shall be very glad. Your
      predecessor was a frequent visitor at our house. A jovial, rubicund
      fellow, whose troubles in this life were less of the world and the devil
      than of the flesh! A fat, ponderous man and a Tory, as all fat men are; a
      sort of Falstaff <i>in pontificalibus</i>; a man with a wit and a shrewd
      palate for old port. Poor fellow! he was snuffed out like a candle. One
      could have better spared a better man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you come to-morrow?" asked Mrs. Haldane; "and, if your sister can
      accompany you, will you bring her? You will excuse our informality and so
      short a notice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be very happy to call tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, if you can spare me a few moments I will have a better opportunity
      of speaking to you. I must learn all about the parish, and I have a whole
      catechism of questions to ask you. You will come to-morrow, then?" she
      concluded, with one of those flashing looks from her great dark eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched them drive away with that look burning in his brain and the
      pressure of her hand tingling through every nerve. He stood gazing after
      her with a passionate light in his eyes and an eager, yearning expression
      on his pale, agitated face. This was the woman he had lost, and now they
      were again thrown together in the same small social circle, after she had
      completely forgotten his existence! Those words of her husband had cut him
      to the quick. Could she so soon, so easily, so completely have forgotten
      him? It seemed incredible. If she had used any such expression to her
      husband, was it not rather to forestall any jealous suspicion on his part?
      Clearly she had not divulged the secret of those schoolgirl days. <i>He</i>
      knew not the story of that sweet, imperishable romance; those burning
      kisses and unforgotten vows had been hidden from him; and in that
      concealment the vicar found a strange, subtle pleasure. It was at least
      one tie between him and her; one secret in common in which her husband had
      no share.

      CHAPTER V. THE LAMB AND THE SHEPHERD.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he vicar was
      standing close beside the village school, and as he turned to go back home
      he saw the schoolmistress in the doorway of her little cottage. He started
      as though she had been looking into his heart, instead of watching the
      carriage as it bowled along towards the village. Without a moment's
      hesitation, however, he opened the schoolyard gate and went up to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Miss Greatheart, how are you to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora, a bright, merry-looking woman of about thirty, dropped a curtsy, and
      invited the vicar into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, no; I must not stay. I have just been speaking, as you have
      seen, to my new parishioners. I call them new, though I suppose they are
      older in the parish than I am myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old as they are, this is the first time I ever set eyes on Mr. Haldane in
      our church, sir. His pretty wife must have converted him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then they have not been long married?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somewhere about two years, I should think. All last year they were away
      in Egypt and Palestine; and perhaps now that he's seen the Land, he
      believes in the Book."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seeing's believing, you know, sir; and if all tales be true, he used not
      to believe in anything from the roof upward. Oh, you may well look
      shocked, sir, but he was quite an atheist and an infidel; but you see he
      was so rich that the gentry round about didn't care to give him the go-by.
      I suppose you haven't been to the Manor yet, sir? The old vicar, Mr. Hart,
      was always there. People did say he paid more court to the people at the
      Manor than he should have done, considering the need for him in the
      parish; and when Mr. Hart got his second stroke, there were those that
      said it was a judgment on him for high living, and the company he kept.
      But you know, sir, how folks' tongues will wag."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the Manor far from here? Of course I have heard of the place, but I
      have never been near it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's about four miles, sir, and a lonely place it is, and dismal it must
      be in winter, with miles of wood about it. In summer it is not so bad, but
      it is awfully wild and solitary. I went over the grounds once, years ago.
      I became acquainted with one of the housemaids, you see, sir&mdash;quite a
      nice young person&mdash;and she invited me to tea. I remember it was
      getting dusk when I left, and she took me through the woods. Dear me, what
      a fright I got! I happened to look up, and there was a man, quite a giant,
      standing among the trees. I screamed, and would have run had not Jane&mdash;that
      was the maid, sir&mdash;laughed, and said it was only a statue. And so it
      was, for we went right up to it. All the woods are full of statues&mdash;quite
      improper and rude, and rather frightening to meet in the dusk. But now he
      is converted, Mrs. Haldane will have them all taken away, I should think.
      I don't believe the place is haunted, though there are some strange
      stories told about it; but I do know that the chapel&mdash;there is an old
      chapel close by the house&mdash;is shut up, and no one goes near it but
      Mr. Haldane and his valet&mdash;a dark foreign person, with such eyes!
      Queer tales are told about lights being seen in it at all hours of the
      night, and some of the old folk believe that if any one could look in they
      would see that the foreign valet had horns and a cloven foot, and that his
      master was worshipping him. I think that's all nonsense myself; but
      there's no doubt Mr. Haldane used to be dreadfully wicked, and an
      atheist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he was so very bad," said the vicar, smiling, "surely it was strange
      that Mr. Hart used to associate with him so much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you see, sir, he was always liberal, and kept a good table, and Mr.
      Hart was a cheerful liver. Then Mr. Haldane was always ready with his
      purse when there was a hard winter, or the crops were bad, or any poor
      person was ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see, I see," said the vicar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But his charity could not do him any good, people said, when he didn't
      believe there was a God, or that he had a soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So they didn't consider it worth while to be thankful?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think they did, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And was Mrs. Haldane staying at the Manor the first year of their
      marriage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; he brought her back with him after the honeymoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do they speak as kindly of her in the village as they do of her
      husband?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, indeed, sir, they worship her. Even old Mother Grimsoll, who said she
      wanted to make a charity woman of her when you bought her that scarlet
      cloak last winter, has a good word for Mrs. Haldane. She isn't the least
      bit conceited, and she knows that poor people have their proper pride; and
      when she helps any one she makes them feel that they are doing her a
      favour. When Mr. Hart was alive she used to go round with him, devising
      and dispensing charities. It's only a pity she is married to&mdash;to&mdash;"&mdash;and
      Miss Greatheart beat impatiently on the ground with her foot in the effort
      to recall the word&mdash;"to an agnostic. Mr. Hart said he wasn't an
      atheist, but an agnostic, though I dare say if the truth were known one is
      worse than the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not very charitable, Miss Greatheart; come, now, confess," said
      the vicar, good-humouredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps not, sir; but I have no patience with atheists and agnostics."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An atheist," continued the vicar, "is a person who does not believe in a
      God; an agnostic is one who merely says he does not know whether there is
      a God or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doesn't know!" exclaimed Dora, indignantly. "Wherever was the man brought
      up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, as Miss Santley and Edith went across from the church to the
      Vicarage together, the vicar joined them, and Miss Dove remained to supper
      as usual. The time passed pleasantly enough; but Edith was conscious of a
      certain restraint, in the conversation, a curious chilliness in the
      atmosphere. When at length she rose to go home, the vicar went to the
      window, and looked out for a few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think, Mary, you might accompany us; and when we have seen Miss Edith
      home, we could take a turn round together. It is a beautiful night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary nodded assent, and Edith felt her heart sink within her. She was
      certain now that he was avoiding her. As she followed Miss Santley
      upstairs to put on her things, a sudden thought flashed upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be with you in a moment, Mary," she said; "I have dropped my
      handkerchief, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran back to the parlour, and met the vicar face to face as he paced
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood still, and looked at him silently for a moment. She had taken
      him by surprise, and he too stood motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said at last, with a faint smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you hate me, Charles?" she asked in a low, steady voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hate you! Why should I hate you, my dear Edith? What should put such
      thoughts&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have only a few seconds to speak to you," Miss Dove continued hastily.
      "Answer me truly and directly. You do not hate me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall never hate you, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Why do you avoid me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have I avoided you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know you have. Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not avoided you, Edith."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you still love me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As much as ever you did?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As much as ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I see you to-morrow&mdash;alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know I am going to the Manor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know," said Edith, with a slight tone of bitterness. "You will return
      in the evening, I suppose? I shall wait for you on the road till nine
      o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may be detained, you know, Edith."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I shall be practising in the church on Tuesday afternoon as usual."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," he assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I still to trust you, Charles?" she asked, raising her soft blue eyes
      earnestly to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes?" She dwelt upon the word, still looking fondly up to him. He
      understood her, and bent over and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will try to return home tomorrow before nine? I have been miserable
      all this week, and I have so much to say to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will try to see you," said the vicar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must run now; Mary will wonder what has kept me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The great woods about Foxglove Manor were certainly lovely, and in the
      winter, with the snow on their black branches, and snow on the fallen
      leaves and the open spaces between the clumps of forestry, the place might
      have seemed dreary and dismal; but on this July afternoon the vicar
      experienced an indescribable sense of buoyancy and enlargement among these
      vast tossing masses of foliage. Their incessant murmur filled the air with
      an inarticulate music, which recalled to his memory the singing pines of
      Theocritus and the voices of the firs of the Hebrew prophets. A spirit of
      romance for ever haunts the woodland, as though the olden traditions of
      dryad and sylvan maiden had not yet been wholly superseded by the more
      accurate report of science. In the skirts of the great clusters of timber,
      cattle were grazing in groups of white and red; in the open spaces of
      pasture land between wood and wood, deer were visible among the patches of
      bracken. In the depths of the forest ways he came upon the colossal
      statues copied from the old masters; and at length, at a turn of the
      shadowy road, he found himself in view of the mansion&mdash;an ancient,
      square mass of brown sandstone, stained with weather and incrustations of
      moss and lichens, and covered all along the southern exposure with a dense
      growth of ivy. The grounds immediately in front were laid out in formal
      plots for flowers and breadths of turf traversed by gravelled pathways. A
      little withdrawn from the house stood the ruined chapel of which the
      schoolmistress had spoken. The ivy had invaded it, and scaled every wall
      to the very eaves, while patches of stonecrop and houseleek, which had
      established themselves on the slated roof, gave it a singular aspect of
      complete abandonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Santley entered one of the walks which led to the terraced
      entrance, Mrs. Haldane, who had observed his approach, appeared on the
      stone steps, and descended to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How good of you to come so early!" she exclaimed. "George will be
      delighted. He is in his laboratory, experimenting as usual. We shall join
      him, after you have had some refreshment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No refreshment for me, thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you quite sure? You must require something after so long a walk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing really, I assure you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I shall not press you, as we shall have dinner soon. Shall we go to
      Mr. Haldane? Have you visited the Manor before&mdash;not in our absence?
      How do you like it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I envy you your magnificent woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; are they not charming? And you will like the house, too, when you
      have seen it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not find it dull, however?" asked the vicar, looking into her face
      with an expression of keen scrutiny. "You are still young&mdash;in the
      blossom of your youth&mdash;and society must still have its attractions
      for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One enjoys society all the more after a little seclusion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And we have just returned, you must recollect, from a whole year of
      wandering and sight-seeing, so that it is a positive relief to awaken
      morning after morning and find the same peaceful landscape, the same quiet
      woods about one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is very natural; but the heart does not long remain content with the
      unchanging face of nature, however beautiful it may be. Even the best and
      strongest require sympathy, and when once we become conscious of that want&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you begun to feel it?" she asked suddenly, as he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose it is the inevitable experience of a clergyman in a country
      parish," he replied, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I suppose it is. So few can take an interest in your tastes, and
      aspirations, and intellectual pleasures, and pursuits. Is not that so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may seem vanity to think so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no; I think not. The people you meet every day are mostly concerned in
      their turnips or the wheat or their cattle, and their talk is the merest
      village gossip. It must indeed be very depressing to listen day after day
      to nothing but that. One has, of course, a refuge in books."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But books are not life. The daydreams of the library are a poor
      substitute for the real action of a mans own heart and brain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then one has also the great fields of natural science to explore. I think
      you will find the work of my husband interesting, and if you could turn
      your mind in the same direction, you would find in him inexhaustible
      sympathy."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, they reached the low-arched portal of the chapel. The thick
      oaken door, studded with big iron nails, was open, and before them stood a
      man who bowed profoundly to Mrs. Haldane, and then darted a swift,
      penetrating glance at the vicar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Haldane is within, Baptisto?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, senora."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood aside to allow them to pass, and as Mr. Santley entered he
      regarded the man with an eye which photographed every feature of his dark
      Spanish face. It was a face which, once seen, stamped itself in haunting
      lineaments on the memory. A dusky olive complexion; a fierce, handsome
      mouth and chin; a broad, intelligent forehead; short, crisp black hair
      sprinkled with grey; a thin, black moustache, twisted and pointed at the
      ends; and a pair of big, black, unfathomable eyes, filled with liquid
      fire. It was the man's eyes that arrested the attention first, gave
      character not only to the face but to the man himself, and indeed served
      to identify him. In the village, "the foreign gentleman with the eyes" was
      the popular and sufficient description of Baptisto.

      CHAPTER VI. THE UNKNOWN GOD.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s the vicar
      entered the chapel, he stopped short, struck with astonishment at the
      singular appearance of the interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sunlight streaming through the leaded diamond panes of the casements,
      instead of falling on the familiar pews, flagged nave, and solemn walls,
      shone with a startling effect on the heterogeneous contents of a museum
      and laboratory. Along one side of the building were ranged several glass
      cases containing collections of fossils, arctic and tropical shells,
      antique implements of flint, stone, and bronze, and geological specimens.
      The walls were decorated with savage curiosities&mdash;shields of skin,
      carved clubs and paddles, spears and arrows tipped with flint or fishbone,
      mats of grass, strings of wampum, and dresses of skins and feathers. On a
      couple of small shelves grinned two rows of hideous crania, gathered as
      ethnic types from all quarters of the barbarian world, and beside them lay
      a plaster cast of a famous paleolithic skull. On the various stands and
      tables in different parts of the room were retorts and crucibles, curious
      tubes, glasses and flasks, electric jars and batteries, balances,
      microscopes, prisms, strange instruments of brass and glass, and a
      bewildering litter of odds and ends, for which only a student of science
      could find a name or a use. At the further end of the room, under the
      coloured east window, stood an escritoire covered with a confused mass of
      paper, and beside it stood a small table piled with books.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mrs. Haldane and the vicar entered, the master of Foxglove Manor, who
      had been writing, rose, laid down his pipe, buttoned his old velvet
      shooting-jacket, and hastened forward to welcome his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baptisto gravely set a couple of chairs, and, at a sign from his master,
      bowed profoundly, and retired to the further end of the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you smoke, Mr. Santley?" Mr. Haldane asked, glancing at a box of new
      clay pipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thank you; but I do not dislike the smell of tobacco. I find,
      however, that smoking disagrees with me&mdash;irritates instead of
      soothing, as professors of the weed tell me it should do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Touches the solar plexus, eh? Then beware of it! The value of the solar
      system is often determined by the condition of the solar plexus."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That does seem to be frequently the case," replied Mr. Santley, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Invariably, my dear sir, as the ancients were well aware when they
      formulated that comprehensive, but little comprehended, proverb of the
      sound mind in the sound body. It is curious how frequently modern science
      finds herself demonstrating the truth of the guesses of the old
      philosophers!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I perceive you are devoted to science," said Mr. Santley, waving his hand
      towards the evidences of his host's taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, he is perpetually experimenting in some direction or other," said
      Mrs. Haldane, with a laugh. "I believe he and Baptisto would pass the
      night here, boiling germs or mounting all manner of invisible little
      monsters for the microscope, if I allowed them. You must know, Mr.
      Santley, that Mr. Haldane is writing a <i>magnum opus</i>&mdash;'The
      History of Morals,' I believe, is to be the title&mdash;and what with his
      experiments and his chapters, he can scarcely find time to dine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been happy in your subject," said the vicar, turning to the
      master of the Manor. "The history of morals must be an enthralling book. I
      can scarcely imagine any subject affording larger scope for literary
      genius than this of the development of that divine law written on the
      heart of Adam. Why do you smile, may I ask?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me; I was not conscious that I did smile, except mentally. You
      will excuse me, however, if I frankly say that I was smiling at your
      conception of the genesis of morality. What you term the divine law
      written on the heart of Adam represents to me a very advanced stage in the
      development of the moral sense. We must begin far beyond Adam, my dear
      sir, if we would arrive at a philosophic appreciation of the subject. We
      must explore as far as possible into that misty and enigmatic period which
      precedes historical record; approach as nearly as may be to the time when
      in the savage, possibly semi-simian, brain of the earliest of our
      predecessors experience had begun to reiterate her proofs that what was
      good was to his personal advantage, and that what was bad entailed loss
      and suffering. It has hitherto been the habit to believe that the
      Decalogue was revealed from Sinai in thunder and lightning and clouds of
      darkness. As a dramatic image or allegory only should that be accepted.
      Clouds of darkness do indeed surround the genesis of the moral in man, and
      the law has been revealed by the deadly lightnings of disease and war and
      famine and misery, through unknown and innumerable generations. No divine
      law was written on the heart of the first man, or society would not be
      where it is to-day. No; unhappily, one might say, morality has been like
      everything else human&mdash;like everything else, human or not,&mdash;like
      the coloured flower to the plant, the gay plumage to the bird, a dearly
      bought conquest, a painfully laboured evolution."
    </p>
    <p>
      Once or twice during Mr. Haldane's remarks, the vicar had raised his hand
      in disclaimer, but waited till he had finished before speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was about to protest," he now said, "against several of your
      expressions, but I fear controversy is of little good when the disputants
      argue from different premises. I perceive that you have accepted a theory
      of life which completely shuts out God from His creation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me; like the old Greek, I can still raise an altar to the unknown
      God."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To a cold, remote, indifferent abstraction, then," replied Mr. Santley,
      impulsively; "to a God unknowing as unknown&mdash;a vague, unrealizable,
      impersonal Power."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impersonal, I grant you, and therefore more logical, even according to
      human reason, than the huge, passionate anthropomorphism of Jew and
      Christian. Consciousness and personality imply the notion of limits and
      conditions; and which is the grander idea&mdash;a limited, conditioned
      Power, however great, or, an absolute transcendent Godhead, free from all
      the limits which govern our finite being? God cannot be conscious as we
      understand consciousness, nor personal as we understand personality-If He
      were, then indeed we might well believe that we were made after His image
      and likeness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And can you find comfort in such a creed? Can you turn for strength, or
      grace, or consolation to such a power as you describe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should I?" asked Mr. Haldane, smiling. "If I need any of these
      things, my need is the result of some law violated or unobserved. The
      world is ruled by law, and every breach of law entails an inescapable
      penalty. If I suffer I must endure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is cold comfort for all the sum of misery in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the only true comfort. The rest is delusion. Preach that every
      violated law avenges itself, not in some half mythical hell at the close
      of a life that seems illimitable&mdash;for men never do realize that they
      will one day die&mdash;but avenges itself here and now; preach that no
      crucified Redeemer can interfere between the violator of the law and its
      penalty; preach that if men sin they will infallibly suffer, and you will
      really do something to regenerate mankind. Christianity, with its
      doctrines of atonement and vicarious suffering and redemption, has done as
      much to fill the world with vice, crime, and disease as the most degraded,
      creed of pagan or savage. The groaning and travail of creation are clamant
      proofs that vicarious suffering and redemption are the veriest dreams."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Either purposely or inadvertently you mix up the physical and the moral
      law," interposed the vicar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The physical and the moral are but one law, articles of the one universal
      code of nature."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," said the vicar. "I forgot that you denied man his immortal soul,
      as you deny him his divine sonship. And so you are content to believe that
      man is born to live, labour, suffer, and perish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Concede that God is content that such should be man's destiny," replied
      Mr. Haldane, "what then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What then?" echoed the vicar, rising from his chair with flashing eyes
      and agitated face; "why, then life is a fiendish mockery!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Haldane's face wore a grim smile as he heard the bitter emphasis of
      the vicar's reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my worthy friend," he said, "you illustrate how necessary it is that
      when one has his hand full of truth he should only open it one finger at a
      time. If you revolt thus angrily against the new gospel, what can be
      expected from the ignorant and the vicious? The meaning and purpose of
      life does not depend on whether the individual man shall perish or shall
      be immortal. If perish he must, he may at least perish heroically.
      Annihilation or immortality does not affect the validity of religion,
      whose paramount aim is not to prepare for another world, but to make the
      best of this&mdash;to realize its ideal greatness and nobility. If life
      should suddenly appear a mockery, contrast the present with that remote
      past of the naked savage of the stone age, or the brutal condition of his
      more remote sylvan ancestor, learning to walk erect and to articulate; and
      then summon up a vision of the possible future, when superstition shall
      have ceased to embitter man's life, when a knowledge of natural law shall
      have made men virtuous, when disease shall have vanished from the world,
      and the nations shall, in a golden age of peace and perfected arts, have
      learnt the method of a patriarchal longevity. Millions of individuals have
      wept and toiled and perished to secure for us the present; we and millions
      shall weep and toil and perish to secure the future for them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that you take to be the significance of life, the progress of the
      race?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is not that at least as noble a significance as a heaven peopled with
      the penitent thief, the drunkard, the gallow's-bird, the harlot, the
      thousand bestial types of humanity redeemed by vicarious agony&mdash;the
      thousand brutes of civilization who, in this age, are not fit for life
      even on this earth, to say nothing of an enlarged immortality?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But with ever-rising grades of immortality before them, even those
      bestial types might ascend to a perfect manhood, and shall they perish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have they not been ascending ever since the Miocene?" asked Mr. Haldane,
      with a scornful laugh. "However, it is little use discussing the matter.
      As you have said, we cannot agree upon first principles. Let me show you,
      instead, some of my curiosities. Did you ever see the Mentone skull? Here
      is a plaster cast of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you accept this dark and comfortless creed of your husband?" asked
      Mr. Santley, turning to Mrs. Haldane as he took the cast in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no," she replied, raising her soft dark eyes to him earnestly; "the
      progress of humanity does not satisfy me as an explanation of the enigma
      of life in man or woman. I cannot abandon my old faith and trust in the
      God-Man for an unknown power who does not care for my suffering and cannot
      hear my prayers. What to me can such a god be? And what can life be but a
      mockery if my soul, with its yearnings and aspirations and ideals, ceases
      to exist after death&mdash;has no other world but this, in which I know
      its infinite wants can never be satisfied?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar's face brightened, and his heart beat with a strange, impulsive
      ardour as he listened to her. Why had this woman, whose enthusiasm and
      sympathy might have enabled him to realize his own high ideal of the
      spiritual, been denied him? What evil destiny had bound her for ever to a
      man whose paralyzing creed must make a perpetual division between them&mdash;a
      man who could look into her sweet face and yet think of her as merely a
      beautiful animal; who could fold her in his arms, and yet tranquilly
      accept the teaching that at death that pure, radiant soul of hers would be
      for ever extinguished? These thoughts and feelings went through the vicars
      consciousness swiftly as sunshine and shadow over a landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes dropped on the plaster cast in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is very old?" he asked musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of the oldest skulls in the world," replied Mr. Haldane. "It was
      discovered by Dr. Rivière in a cave at Mentone, in a cliff overlooking the
      sea. The man belonged to the ancient stone age, and was contemporary with
      the mammoth and woolly rhinoceros of the Post-pliocene. The cave was a
      place of burial, and on the head of the skeleton was a thickly plaited
      network of sea-shells, with a fringe of deers' teeth around the edge; the
      limbs were adorned with bracelets and anklets of shells also; and in front
      of the face was placed a little oxide of iron, used as war-paint, no
      doubt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even in the Post-pliocene, then," said the vicar, "it would appear that
      man believed in a hereafter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes; it is an antique superstition, and even yet we have not outgrown
      it-Human progress is slow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this face was raised to the blue sky ages ago, looking for God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Haldane shrugged his shoulders, and smiled grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is it possible that you, who-must share the weaknesses and sorrows of
      the human heart, can so stoically accept the horrible prospect of
      annihilation?" asked the vicar, half angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I accept truths. Do you imagine I prefer annihilation? I could wish that
      life were ordered otherwise, but wishing' cannot change an eternal system.
      Immortality cannot be achieved by defying' annihilation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you realized death?" exclaimed the vicar, passionately. "Can you,
      dare you, look forward to a time when, say, your wife shall lie cold and
      lifeless,&mdash;and hold to the doctrine that you have lost her for ever,
      that never again shall your spirit mingle with hers, that you and she are
      for all eternity divorced?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You appeal to the passions, and not to the reason," replied Mr. Haldane,
      coldly. "What holds good for the beast which perishes, holds good for all
      of us, and will hold good for those who come after us, and who will be
      greater and nobler than we."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so," replied the vicar, in an undertone. As he spoke he bit his
      lip, and his cheek coloured. The thought was not meant for utterance, but
      it slipped into words before he was aware. For the full significance of
      that thought was a singular exemplification of the conflicting spiritual
      and animal natures of the man. That divorce of death which had been
      pronounced inevitable opened before him, in a dreamy vista of the future,
      a new world of ecstatic beatitude, where his soul and the radiant spirit
      of the woman who stood beside him should be mingled together in
      indissoluble communion.

      CHAPTER VII. CELESTIAL AFFINITIES.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>hortly afterwards
      Mrs. Haldane suggested that they should take a turn about the grounds,
      instead of wasting the sunshine indoors. As they left the chapel the vicar
      paused and looked back at the ivy-draped building, with its half-hidden
      lancets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have turned a sacred edifice to a strange use," he said. "Here,
      within the walls where past generations have dwelt and worshipped, you
      have set up your apparatus for the destruction of man's holiest heritage.
      Pardon me if I speak warmly, but to me this appears to be sacrilege."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Church has always been intolerant of science and research," replied
      Mr. Haldane, good-humouredly, "and it is the fortune of conflict if
      sometimes we are able to make reprisals. But, seriously, I see no
      desecration here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No desecration in converting Gods house into a laboratory to analyze soul
      and spirit into function and force!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No desecration," should say, "in converting the shrine of a narrow,
      selfish superstition into a schoolroom where one may learn a truer and a
      grander theology, and a less presumptuous and illusive theory of life. It
      is, however, impossible for us to be at one on these matters; let us at
      least agree to differ amicably. Your predecessor and I found much of
      common interest. He was of the old school, but life had taught him a
      kindly tolerance of opinion. To you, as I gleaned from your sermon
      yesterday, the new philosophy and modern criticism are familiar. You must
      surely concede that the old theological ground must be immeasurably
      widened, if you are still resolved to occupy it. Why should you fear
      truth, if God has indeed revealed Himself to the Church?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Church does not fear truth," replied the vicar; "but she does fear
      the wild speculations and guesses at truth which unsettle the faith of the
      world. For myself I have looked into some of these fantastic theories of
      science, and I repudiate them as at once blasphemous and hopeless. It is
      easy to destroy the old trust in the beneficence of Providence, in the
      redemption and destiny of man; but when you have accomplished that, you
      can go no further. Tyndall proves to you that all life in the world is the
      outcome of antecedent life; Haeckel contends that science must in the long
      run accept spontaneous generation. Your leading men are at loggerheads;
      and it signifies little which is right, for in either case the <i>causa
      causans</i> is only removed one link further back in the chain of
      causation. Some of you hold that there is only matter and force in the
      universe, but on others it is beginning to dawn that possibly matter and
      force are in the ultimate one and the same. And again, it signifies little
      which is right, for both, being conditioned, must have had a beginning. A
      God, a creative Power, is needed in the long run&mdash;'a power behind
      humanity, and behind all other things,' as Herbert Spencer describes it; a
      God of whom science can predicate nothing, of whom science declares it to
      be beyond her province to speak, but of whom every heart is at some time
      vividly conscious and has been from the beginning&mdash;demonstrably from
      the Paleolithic period until now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Mr. Santley, I am so pleased you have said that. I have often wished
      that I were able to answer my husband, but I have no power of argument,"
      said Mrs. Haldane, looking gratefully at the vicar. "You must not think he
      is not a good, a real practical Christian, in spite of his opinions."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Haldane laughed quietly as his wife slipped her hand into his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to the God of the Paleolithic man, Mr. Santley forgets that it was at
      best a personification of some of the great natural powers&mdash;wind;
      rain, thunder, sunshine, and moonlight; and as to Christianity, my dear,
      there is much in the teaching of Christ, and even of the Church, which I
      reverence and hold sacred. Morality, and the consequent civilization of
      the world, owes more to Christianity than to any other creed. It has done
      much evil, but I think it has done more good. Purified from its mythic
      delusions, it has still a splendid future before it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And <i>à propos</i> of practical Christianity, Mr. Santley," continued
      Mrs. Haldane, "I want to talk to you about the parish. I am eager to begin
      with my poor people again; and, by-the-bye, the children have, I
      understand, had no school treat yet this year. Now, sit down here and tell
      me all about your sick, in the first place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Haldane stood listening to the woes and illnesses of the village for a
      few minutes, and then left them together in deep discussions over flannels
      and medicines and nourishing food. Dinner passed pleasantly enough. The
      vicar had satisfied his conscience by protesting against the desecration
      of the chapel and the disastrous results of scientific research. Clearly
      it was useless, and worse than useless, to contend with this
      large-natured, clear-headed unbeliever. It was infinitely more agreeable
      to feel the soft dark light of Mrs. Haldane's eyes dwelling on his face,
      and to listen to the music of her voice as she told him of their travels
      abroad. In his imagination the scenes she described rose before him, and
      he and she were the central figures in the clear, new landscape. He
      thought of their walks on the cliffs and on the sea-shore, in the golden
      days that had gone by. How easily it might have been!
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had gone down when he parted from his host and hostess at the
      great gate at the end of the avenue. He had declined their offer to drive
      him over to Omberley. He preferred walking in the cool of the evening, and
      the distance was, he professed, not at all too great. As he shook hands
      with her, that wild, etherial fancy of a world to come, in which her
      husband would have no claim to her, brightened his eyes and flushed his
      cheek. There was a strange nervous pressure in the touch of his hand, and
      an expression of surprise started into her face. He noticed it at once,
      and was warned. Mr. Haldane's farewell was bluffly cordial, and he warmly
      pressed the vicar to call on them at any time that best suited his
      convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were pretty sure to be always at home, and they were not likely to
      have too much company.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he walked along the high-road, bordered on one side with the green
      murmuring masses of foliage, and on the other with waving breadths of
      corn, his mind was absorbed in that new dream of transcendent love. There
      was nothing earthly or gross in this dawning glow of spiritual passion;
      indeed, it raised him in delicious exaltation beyond the coarseness of the
      physical, till, as it suddenly occurred to him that somewhere on his way
      Edith was waiting for him, his heart rose in revulsion at the recollection
      of her. At the same time there was a large element of the sensuous beauty
      of transient humanity in that celestial forecast. The pure, radiant spirit
      of the woman he loved still wore the sweet lineaments of her earthly
      loveliness. Death had not destroyed that magical face; those dark,
      luminous, loving eyes; that sweet shape of womanhood. The spiritual body
      was cast in the mould of the physical, and the chief difference lay in a
      shining mistiness of colour, which floated in a sort of elusive drapery
      about the glorified woman, and replaced the worldly silks and satins of
      the living wife. This spiritual being was no intangible abstraction, of
      which only the intellect could take cognizance. As in its temporal
      condition, it could still kiss and thrill with a touch. Clearly, however
      unconscious he might be of the fact, the vicar's conception of the divine
      was intensely human, and his spiritual idealizations were the immediate
      growth and delicate blossom of the senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great stillness was growing over the land as he pursued his way. The
      woodlands had been left behind him, and their incessant murmur was now
      inaudible. Sleep and quietude had fallen on the level fields; not an ear
      of wheat stirred, no leaf rustled. The birds had all gone to nest, except
      a solitary string of belated crows, flying low down in black dots, against
      the distant silvery green horizon. The moon was rising through a low-lying
      haze, which had begun to spread over the landscape. The vicar looked at
      his watch. It was after nine o'clock. He began to hope that Edith had
      grown tired of waiting for him, and had returned home. He had a sickening
      feeling of repugnance and vague dread of meeting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little more than a month after Mr. Santley had settled in Omberley, Miss
      Dove had come to live with her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father and mother had died within a year of each other, and the girl
      gladly accepted the offer of Mrs. Russell to consider her house as a home
      until she had had time to look about her. Edith had been left sufficiently
      well provided for, and her aunt, the widow of a banker, was in a position
      of independence, so that the disinterested offer was accepted without any
      sense of dependence or humiliation. The bright, innocent face of the girl
      instantly caught the eye of the vicar. He saw her frequently at her aunt's
      house, and gradually learned to esteem, not only her excellent qualities,
      but to find a use for her accomplishments. She was especially fond of
      music, and when the vicar suggested that she might add to the beauty of
      the service at St. Cuthbert's by interesting herself in the choir and
      presiding at the organ, she eagerly acquiesced. The church was one of
      Edith's favourite haunts; and when the vicar, who was himself a lover of
      music, heard the soul-stirring vibrations of some masterpiece of the great
      composers, his steps were drawn by an easily explicable fatality to the
      side of the pretty performer. Still, it was a fatality. Slowly, and
      imperceptibly at first, the sense of pleasure at meeting grew up between
      the two; then swiftly and imperceptibly they found that there was
      something in the presence of each other that satisfied a vague,
      indefinable craving; and lastly, with a sudden access of
      self-consciousness, they looked into each other's eyes, and each became
      gladly and tremulously aware of the other's love. Edith was still young,
      almost too young yet to assume the station of the wife of the spiritual
      head of the parish; and Mr. Santley was not sure as to the manner in which
      his sister would receive the intimation that there was, even in the remote
      future, to be a new mistress brought to the Vicarage. The girl was,
      however, still too happy in the knowledge that she was beloved to look
      forward to marriage. With a strange, feminine inconsistency, she regarded
      their union with a certain dread and shamefacedness. It seemed such a
      dreadful exposure that all the village should know that they loved each
      other. "Oh no, no; it must not be for a long, long time yet!" she once
      exclaimed nervously. "Is it not sufficient happiness to know that I am
      yours and you are mine? I cannot bear to think that every one must know
      our secret." To have those long, pleasant chats under cover of the music;
      to be invited to the Vicarage, and to sit and talk with him there; to
      receive those haphazard glances, as it were, while he was preaching; to be
      escorted home by him in the evening when it was dark, and no one could see
      that her hand was on his arm; to receive those almost stolen kisses; to
      feel his arm about her waist what more could maiden desire to dream over
      for weeks and months&mdash;for years, if need were?
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith was endowed with the intense feminine faith and fervid ideality of
      the worshipper. To sit at her lover's feet and to look up adoringly to
      him, was at once her favourite mental and physical attitude. On her side,
      she exercised a curious spiritual influence over him. There was such an
      aerial brightness and lightness about her, such sweet fragile loveliness
      in her form and figure, such tender abandonment of self in her
      disposition, that he felt he had not only a woman to love, but a beautiful
      childlike soul to keep unspotted from the world, to guide through the dark
      ways of life to the arms of the great loving Fatherhood of God. The
      presence of Edith helped him to banish the dark doubts and evil promptings
      of the spirit of unbelief. When she spoke to him of her spiritual
      experiences, he felt joyous ascensions of the heart which raised him
      nearer to heaven. She created in him the unspeakable holy longings and
      vague wants that give the lives of the mystic saints of Roman Catholicism
      so singular a blending of divine illumination and voluptuous colour.
      Unconsciously the vicar was realizing in his own nature Swedenborg's
      doctrine of celestial affinities. This love restored to him the innocence
      and ardour of the days of Eden; he had found at once his Eve and his
      Paradise, and he felt that, as of old, God still walked in the garden in
      the cool of the day. Some such glamour surrounds the first developments of
      every sincere attachment. It is the first rosy tingling flush of dawn, dim
      and sweet and dreamy, and, like the dawn, it glows and brightens into the
      fierce clear heat of broad day, burning the dew from the petal and
      withering the blossom.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Santley's thoughts turned to Edith, the recollection of these
      things came vividly upon him. Only a week ago, and she was the one woman
      in the world he believed he could have chosen for his wife. In an instant,
      at the sight of a face, all had been changed. His love had become a
      burthen, a shame, a dread to him. Edith had grown hateful to him. At the
      same time, he could not deaden the sting of remorse as he reflected on his
      broken vows. The passionate protestations he had uttered sounded again in
      his ears in accents of bitter mockery; the pledges he had given seemed now
      to him hideous blasphemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a bend of the road he suddenly came in sight of a figure moving before
      him in the dusk. He knew at a glance it was she, and he prepared himself
      for the meeting. Although he earnestly wished to disembarrass himself of
      her, he found himself unable to do so at once and brutally. He would try
      to estrange her, and free himself little by little.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they approached each other he saw that Edith's face was grave and sad.
      She was trying to learn from his look in what manner she ought to speak to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His assurances on the previous evening had not tranquillized her, and she
      had still a terrible misgiving that a chasm was widening between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am a little later than I expected," he said, as he held out his hand to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does not signify <i>now</i>. I was only afraid that you might be so
      late I should have to go home without seeing you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply, and they walked on side by side in silence for a few
      seconds. At last she stopped abruptly and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charles," she said, "you know what you said to me last night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it true?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should you ask such a question? Why should you doubt its truth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I try not to doubt it, but I cannot help it. Oh, tell me again that you
      do not hate and contemn me! Tell me you still love me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Edith," replied the vicar, laying his hand on her arm, "you are
      not well. You have been overtaxing your strength and exciting yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith did not answer, but the tears rose to her eyes and began to run down
      her cheeks. She did not sob or make any sound of weeping, but her hand was
      pressed against her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, don't cry like that; you know I cannot bear to see you cry."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped as he spoke, and took her hand in his. They stood still a
      little while, and she at length was able to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you remember," she asked in a low, broken voice, "that I once told you
      you were my conscience?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He regarded her uneasily before he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; you once said that, I know. But why return to that now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And have you not been?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your word," she continued, "has been my law; what you have said I have
      believed. Have I done wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why are you letting these things trouble you now?" he asked impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I know that when a woman gives herself wholly to the man she
      loves, it is common for her to lose him, and I have begun to feel that I
      am losing you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not think I have given you any reason to feel that."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not speak again immediately, but stood with her innocent blue eyes
      raised beseechingly to his face. Suddenly she took hold of his hands, and
      said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You told me that in the eyes of God we were man and wife, that no
      marriage ceremony could ever join us together more truly, that marriage
      really consisted in the union of heart and soul, not in the words of any
      priest&mdash;did you not? Was that true? Am I still your little wife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated. The blood had vanished from his cheek, leaving it haggard
      and pale; she felt his hands trembling in hers. Then, with a sudden
      impulse, he took her face between his hands and drew her towards him, as
      he answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are, darling. I will not do you any wrong."

      CHAPTER VIII. A SICK-CALL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Santley's reply
      was as sincere at the moment it was spoken as it was impulsive. The saner
      and better part of him rose in sudden sympathy towards this young,
      confiding girl who had laid her whole being in his hands, to be his
      treasure or his plaything. He resolved to be faithful to the solemn pledge
      he had given her, and to cast from him for ever all thought of Mrs.
      Haldane, and all memory of that passionate episode of the past. He drew
      Edith's hand under his arm and held it there. That warm little bit of
      responsive flesh and blood had still, he felt, a power to thrill through
      his nature. He bent down and kissed it. For some time their conversation
      was embarrassed, but gradually all sense of doubt and estrangement
      vanished, and he was telling her about his visit to the Manor. A pressure
      was laid upon him to make her such amends as he was able for his coldness
      during the past week, and he determined to break the spell which Mrs.
      Haldane's beauty threw over him by revealing their old friendship to
      Edith. It was not wise, but under the stress of remorse and a reviving
      passion men seldom act wisely. Except in the case of a jealous
      disposition, a woman is always pleased to hear of her lover's old vaguely
      cherished love affairs, when there is no possibility of their ever coming
      to life again. She knows instinctively, even when she is not told so
      adoringly, that she supersedes all her predecessors and combines all their
      virtues and charms. He loved this one for her beauty and sweetness, that
      one for her clear bright intelligence; each in a different way; but her he
      loves in both the old ways, and in a new way also which she alone could
      inspire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Haldane was an old pupil of mine&mdash;indeed, a favourite pupil&mdash;many
      years ago; so, naturally, I am much interested in her," said the vicar in
      a tentative manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were a revelation to Edith; they explained to her all her
      uneasiness and all his change of manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you find that you still love her a little?" Edith ventured to say in
      a sad, faltering tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never said I loved her, my dear," replied the vicar, with a forced
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you did, did you not? She was your favourite pupil."
    </p>
    <p>
      How uncomfortably keen-sighted this young person seemed to be, in spite of
      her soft, endearing ways!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you be a little jealous if I said I did?" he asked, regarding her
      with a scrutinizing look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jealous! Oh no. Why should I? Is she not married? And am I not really and
      truly your little wife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed her hand gently for answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when you saw her again last Sunday, and saw how beautiful she was,"
      Edith continued, "you felt sorry that you had lost her&mdash;just a little
      regretful, did you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar hesitated, and then did the most foolish thing a man can do in
      such circumstances&mdash;confessed the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not be vexed, darling, if I say that I did feel regret?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You loved her very much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was my first love." replied the vicar. "But you must remember it was
      years ago. Long before I knew you; when I was quite a young man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And was she very fond of you?" Edith went on quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I used to think she was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But she was not true to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not blame her. I do not think it was her fault. Her people were
      wealthy, and I was poor, a poor teacher."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it was this made you so cold and hard to me all last week?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Santley did not answer at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be brutal to say yes, and he dared not hazard a denial.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Charles, she never loved you as I have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never, never," replied the vicar hurriedly; and a flush rose to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you meet her, when you see her again," said Edith, grasping his arm
      with earnest emphasis, "will you remember that? Promise me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will never forget it," said the vicar in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not see Mrs. Haldane again, however, during the week. On the
      following Sunday his eyes wandered only for a moment towards the Manor
      pew, and he perceived that she was alone. When he met her after the
      service his manner was constrained, but she appeared not to notice it. She
      spoke again of the parish work, and told him that in a day or two she
      would drive over and accompany him on some of his calls. He looked forward
      with uneasiness and self-distrust to her cooperation in his daily work.
      There was an irresistible something, a magical atmosphere, an invisible
      radiation of the enticing about this woman. Her large glowing black eyes
      seemed to fasten upon his soul and draw it beyond his control. Her starry
      smile intoxicated and maddened him. Beside her, Edith was but a weak,
      delicate child, with a child's clinging attachment, a child's credulity
      and trust, a child's little gusts of passion. His lost love was a woman&mdash;such
      a woman as men in old times would have perished for as a queen, would have
      worshipped as a goddess&mdash;such a woman, he fancied, as that Naomi
      whose beauty has been the mysterious tradition of five thousand years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early one afternoon, about the middle of the week, the vicar was just
      about to set out on his customary round of visitation, when Mrs. Haldane's
      pony-carriage drove up to the gate. He assisted her to alight, and
      returned with her to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Santley, who had been as sensitive to the change in her brother as
      Edith herself, regarded Mrs. Haldane with little favour. She was ready to
      acknowledge that it was very good and kind of the mistress of Foxglove
      Manor to interest herself in the wants and suffering of the parish, but
      she entertained grave misgivings as to the prudence of her brother and
      this old pupil of his being thrown too frequently together. She was just a
      little formal and reserved with her visitor, who announced her intention
      of going with the vicar to this sick-call he had spoken of.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will have to walk, however," said Mr. Santley, "as the cottage is
      some little distance across the fields."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came prepared for walking," she replied, with a laugh. "James can put
      up at the village till our return."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you do us the favour of taking tea with us?" asked Miss Santley,
      "You will, require it, if my brother takes you his usual round."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, I shall be very glad. If James calls for me at&mdash;what time
      shall I say?&mdash;six, will that be soon enough?" The coachman received
      his instructions, and Mr. Santley and Mrs. Haldane set out on their first
      combined mission. They traversed half a dozen fields, and came in sight of
      a small cluster of cottages lying low in a green hollow. A narrow lane ran
      past them to Omberley in one direction and to the high-road in another.
      Half a dozen poplars grew in a line along the lane, and the cottages were
      surrounded by small gardens, filled with fruit trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a picturesque little spot!" exclaimed Mrs. Haldane. "I think nothing
      looks so pretty as an English cottage with its white walls and tiled roof
      peering out from a cluster of apple; and pear trees."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty enough, but damp!" replied the vicar. "In wet weather they are in
      a perfect quagmire. Ah, listen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now very near the houses, and the sound to which Mr. Santley
      called her attention was the voice of a man crying out in great pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can it be?" asked Mrs. Haldane, with a look of alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the poor fellow we are going to see. He was knocked down and run
      over by a cart about two years ago. His spine has been injured, and the
      doctors can do nothing for him. He is quite helpless, and has been
      bedridden all that time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor creature! what a dreadful thing it must be to suffer like that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes for weeks together he feels no pain. Then he is suddenly seized
      by the most fearful torture, and you can hear his cries for a great
      distance."
    </p>
    <p>
      As they approached the cottage the man's voice grew louder, and they could
      distinguish his words: "Oh, what shall I do? Oh, who'll tell me what to
      do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Haldane shuddered. In that green, peaceful, picturesque spot that
      persistent reiteration of the man's agony was horrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you come in?" asked the vicar doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion signed her assent, and Mr. Santley knocked gently at the
      door. In a few seconds some one was heard coming down the staircase, and a
      little gray-haired, gray-faced woman, dressed in black, came to the door
      and curtsied to her visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mansfield is very bad again to-day?" said the vicar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, this be one of his bad days, sir. He have been that bad since Sunday,
      I haven't known what to do with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of the sick man suddenly ceased, and he appeared to be
      listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's there?" he shrieked out, after a pause. "Jennie; blast you! who's
      there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He be raving mad, ma'am!" said Mrs. Mansfield, apologetically. "He don't
      know what he is saying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jennie, you damned little varmint&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, John, it be the parson!" his wife called up the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To hell with the parson! Oh, what shall I do? Oh, who'll tell me what to
      do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go up to him, sir, and tell him you're here. He be very bad to-day,
      poor soul! Will it please you to walk in, ma'am?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The little woman went upstairs, and her entrance to the sick-room was
      greeted with a volley of foul curses screamed out in furious rage.
      Gradually, however, the access of passion was exhausted, and the man was
      again heard repeating his hopeless appeal for relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do they live?" asked Mrs. Haldane, glancing about the small but
      scrupulously clean room in which she stood. "Have they any grown-up
      children?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, only their two selves. She is the bread-winner. She does knitting and
      sewing, and the neighbours, who are very kind to her, assist her with her
      garden and do her many little kindnesses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor woman! And she has endured this horrible infliction for two years!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you please, sir, you can come up now," said Mrs. Mansfield from the
      top of the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar went up, and Mrs. Haldane followed him. They entered a pretty
      large whitewashed bedroom, with raftered roof and a four-post bedstead in
      the centre of the room. Though meagrely furnished, everything was
      spotlessly clean and tidy. On the bed lay a great gaunt man, panting and
      moaning, with his large filmy blue eyes turned up to the roof. He was far
      above the common stature, and his huge wasted frame, only half hidden by
      the bedclothes, was piteous to look at. His large venerable head, covered
      with thin, long white hair, filled one with surprise and regretful
      admiration. His face was thin and colourless, and a fringe of white beard
      gave it a still more deathly appearance. One could scarcely believe that
      the wreck before him was a common labourer. It seemed rather such a
      spectacle as Beatrice Cenci might have looked on had her father died
      cursing on his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's parson come to see thee, and a lady wi' him," said Mrs. Mansfield,
      raising her husband's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at them with his glazed blue eyes, made prominent with pain, and
      his moaning grew louder, till they could again distinguish the constant
      cry for release from pain: "Oh, what shall I do? Oh, who'll tell me what
      to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try to think of God, and pray to Him for help," said the vicar, bending
      over the suffering man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I have prayed and prayed and prayed," he replied querulously; "but it
      does no good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He were praying all day yesterday and singing hymns," said Mrs.
      Mans-held. "I don't know what's gotten hold of him to-day, but he have
      been dreadful. And he were ever such a pious, God-fearing man. It fair
      breaks my heart to hear him swearing like that. But God will not count it
      against him, for he's been clean beside himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, let me hear you pray now, Mansfield," said the vicar. "Turn your
      heart and your mind to God, and He will comfort you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O God," said the sick man, with the obedient simplicity of a child, "I
      turn my heart and my mind to Thee; do Thou comfort me and take me to
      Thyself. O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God and Saviour of mankind, do Thou
      remember me in Thy paradise. Look down upon me, O Lord, a miserable
      offender, and spare Thou them which confess their faults and are truly
      penitent."
    </p>
    <p>
      With a strange light on his white, wasted face, with his gaunt hands
      folded on the counterpane before him, the old man sat up in bed and prayed
      in the same loud voice of pain and semi-delirium. A wild, inconceivable,
      interminable prayer; for long after they had left the house, old Mansfield
      could be heard some hundreds of yards away, screaming to God for mercy and
      consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We had better leave him praying," said the vicar softly; "and when he
      begins cursing and swearing again, Mrs. Mansfield, just kneel down and
      pray in a loud voice beside him. It will suggest a new current to his
      thoughts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God won't count his cursing against him, sir, will he?" asked the little
      woman. "He were ever a sober Christian man till this misery came on him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," said the vicar; "God judges the heart, not the tongue of
      delirium."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How old is your husband?" inquired Mrs. Haldane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He be eighty-one come Martinmas, ma'am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor old man! And you do sewing and knitting, do you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, ma'am, what he lets me do. He be main fractious whiles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And have you plenty to go on with at present?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have what'll keep me busy for a fortnight yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will see you again before then. I hope your husband will soon be
      better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There be no hope of that, ma'am. The only betterness for him 'll be when
      God takes him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know you will be able to find a use for this," said Mrs. Haldane in a
      whisper, as they went, out of the house. "Goodbye for the present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, ma'am! God bless you!" said Mrs. Mansfield, the tears springing into
      her eyes as she looked at the gold coin in her hand.

      CHAPTER IX. A SUMMER SHOWER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>fter that first
      round of visitation Mrs. Haldane and the vicar met very frequently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found that she could be of use to a great number of poor people, and
      the occupation afforded her by her self-imposed duties was novel and
      interesting. It is pleasant to take the place of Providence, and mete out
      help and gladness to afflicted humanity. She was actuated by no petty
      spirit of vanity or ostentation; and though she soon learned that the
      poorer and more necessitous people are, the more thankless they are as a
      rule, these disagreeable experiences did not disillusion her. Very often
      she would leave her carriage at the village inn and accompany Mr. Santley
      on foot across the fields and down the deep green lanes to the different
      houses at which he was to call. Their conversations on these occasions
      were very interesting to her; and more than once as she drove back home in
      the evening she fell a-thinking of that distant schoolgirl past which Jiad
      so nearly faded away from her memory, and began to wonder whether, if her
      family had not so promptly extinguished that little romance of hers, she
      would now have been the wife of the vicar of Omberley. No word had yet
      passed between them of that old time, and occasionally she felt just the
      least curiosity to know how he regarded it. She knew he had not forgotten
      it, and she smiled to herself as she called to mind the way in which he
      had addressed her as "Ellen" that first Sunday. She had ever since been
      only Mrs. Haldane to him. There was a singular fascination about him which
      she was unable to explain to herself. She remembered his words, his looks
      his gestures with a curious distinctness. She was conscious that,
      notwithstanding his reticence, he still entertained a warm attachment to
      her. She could see it in his eyes, could hear it in the tones of his
      voice, could feel it in the pressure of his hand. There is no incentive to
      affection so powerful and subtle as the knowledge that one is beloved.
      Without any analysis of her feelings or any misgiving whatever, Mrs.
      Haldane knew that the vicar's friendship was very dear to her, that his
      sympathy and counsel were rapidly growing indispensable. Many things
      troubled her in connection with her husband&mdash;his indifference to any
      form of religion, his stern acceptance of the conclusions of science,
      however destructive they might be of all that the world had clung to as
      essential to goodness and happiness, his utter disbelief of the truths of
      revelation, his rejection of the only God in whom she could place trust
      and confidence. Diffidently at first, and with pain and doubt, she spoke
      to Mr. Santley of these troubles, and of the waverings of her own
      convictions. Her husband was so good, so upright and noble a man, that she
      could not despair of his some day returning to the faith and the Church of
      his boyhood. Could the vicar not aid her in winning him back to God? Then,
      too, at times her husband's words appealed to her reason so irresistibly
      that she began to question whether after all she had not spent her life in
      the worship of a delusion. That did not happen often, but it terrified her
      that it should be possible for her at any time or in any circumstance to
      call in question the fatherhood of God or the divinity of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only natural that these matters-should draw the vicar and his fair
      parishioner very close to each other; and that intimate relationship of
      soul with soul by subtle degrees widened and widened till each became
      deeply interested in everything that could in any way affect the other. In
      spite of his strongest resolve to be true to Edith, Mr. Santley felt
      himself irresistibly drawn to her beautiful rival. He struggled with the
      enchantment till further resistance seemed useless, and then he sought
      refuge in self-deception. His nature, he fancied, was wide enough to
      include the love of both. To Edith he could give the affection of a
      husband, to Ellen the anticipative passion of a disfranchised spirit. One
      was a temporal, the other an eternal sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon, as they were returning from a visit, being on the edge of
      the moss about a couple of miles from the village, they were overtaken by
      a storm. There was a clump of trees hard by, and they entered it for
      shelter. Mrs. Haldane had her waterproof with her; but the rain drove in
      such drenching showers, that the vicar insisted on her standing under his
      umbrella and sheltering her person with her own. Side by side, with the
      large trunk of a beech-tree behind them and its tossing branches overhead,
      they stood there for nearly half an hour. He held his umbrella over her so
      that his arm almost touched her further shoulder. They were very close
      together, and while she watched the flying volleys of rain he was gazing
      on the beautiful complexion of her face and neck, on the rich dark masses
      of her hair, her sweet arched eyebrows and long curving eyelashes. For
      years he had not been able to regard her so closely. She did not notice
      his scrutiny at first, but, when she did, little sunny flushes of colour
      made her loveliness still more electrical. They were talking of the storm
      at first, but now there was an interval of silence. She felt his eyes upon
      her face&mdash;they seemed to touch her, and the contract made her cheeks
      glow. At last she turned and looked straight at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was thinking of long ago," he said in answer to her look; "do you
      remember how once we were caught by a thunderstorm at Seacombe, and we
      stood together under a tree just as we are now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What an excellent memory you have!" she said with a smile, while her
      colour again rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never forget anything," rejoined Mr. Santley with emphasis. "But surely
      you too recollect that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes; I have not forgotten it," she said lightly. "We were very foolish
      people in those days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We were very happy people, were we not?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I think we were; it was a childish happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Manhood, then, has brought me no greater. Ah, Ellen, you seem to have
      easily let the past slip away from you. With me it is as vivid to-day as
      if it were only yesterday that you and I walked on the cliffs together. Do
      you remember we went to the gipsy's camp in the sand-hills, and had our
      fortunes told?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Haldane blushed and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We were foolish enough to do anything, I think, at that time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That pretty gipsy girl with the dark almond eyes and red-and-amber
      headdress was sadly out in her reading of our destinies."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Haldane made no reply. These reminiscences, and especially the tone
      in which the vicar dwelt on them, disquieted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think the worst of the shower is over now," she said, stepping from
      under his umbrella. As she spoke, however, a fresh gust of wind and rain
      contradicted her, and she stepped further into the shelter of the tree.
      Mr. Santley clearly understood the significance of her words and action.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is raining far too heavily to go yet," he said gently. "Let me hold my
      umbrella over you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She consented a little uneasily, but he laid his hand upon her arm and
      said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have displeased you by referring to the past, have I not? Come, be
      frank with me. Surely we are good enough friends by this to speak candidly
      to each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her great dark eyes to his face and replied gravely,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not like you to speak of the past in that way. I do not think it is
      right. I hope we <i>are</i> good enough friends to speak candidly. I have
      trusted you as a friend, as a very dear and true friend. I wish to keep
      you always my friend; but when you spoke just now of our childish liking
      for each other, I do not think you spoke as a&mdash;friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar was silent, and his eyes were cast on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have I done you an injustice?" she asked in a low tone, after a little
      pause. "Then, pray, do forgive me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar regarded her with a look of sadness, and took the little gloved
      hand she held out to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do me injustice in thinking that I have forgotten your position."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Haldane coloured deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," continued the vicar, "I have not forgotten that. I <i>cannot</i>
      forget it. And if I still love you with the old love of those vanished
      years, if I love you with a love which will colour my whole life, do not
      imagine that it is with any hope of a response in this world. I do your
      husband no injustice; I do you no dishonour. I loved you long before he
      knew you; I shall love you still in that after life in which he has
      deliberately abandoned all claim to you in the very existence of which he
      places no belief. Between this and then let me be your friend&mdash;your
      brother; let me be as one in whom you will ever find sympathy and
      devotedness; one who can share and understand all your doubts and
      distress, all your temptations and trials. I do not ask you to love me; I
      only ask you to let me love you." This gust of passion was so sudden, so
      unexpected, so overwhelming, that almost before she was aware, he had
      spoken and she had listened. And now as she thought of what he said a
      strangely mixed sensation of doubt and pleasure awoke within her. All that
      he wished to be he was indeed already in her eyes&mdash;her adviser,
      sympathiser, friend. Only this secret unexpectant love which lived on the
      past and the future agitated her. And yet surely it was a pure spiritual
      love which asked for no return on this side of the grave. These thoughts
      occurred to her before she took the sober common-sense view of what he had
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are taking too visionary, too feverish a view of life when you speak
      in that way," she said gently. "We cannot live on dreams. Our duties, our
      work, our disappointments and cares are too real for us to be satisfied
      with any love less real. You will some day meet some one worthy of your
      affection, capable of sympathising with you and aiding you in your
      life-work&mdash;some one who will be a fitting helpmeet to you. For my
      part, I think that whenever we have missed what we are apt to consider a
      great happiness it is a sure sign that God intends some better thing for
      us."
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar shook his head silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you must have more faith!" she continued brightly. "And it ought to
      be very easy for you to have faith in this matter. You have all the
      advantages on your side. And, if I may be frank with you, I will say that
      I think you would be happier if you <i>were</i> married. You need some
      responsive heart, and nowhere could one more need close companionship than
      in such a place as Omberley."
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain had ceased, and as she spoke the last words she glanced up at the
      clouds breaking away from the sunny blue of the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think we may safely start now. How bright and sweet everything looks
      after the rain; and what a fragrance the fields have!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Santley did not attempt to renew the conversation. Clearly she was not
      in the mood, and he believed that what he had said had fallen as seed in a
      generous soil, and would germinate in the warmth of her fervid
      temperament. It was enough that she knew he still loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a knowledge is ever dangerous to an imaginative woman. For several
      days after that incident Mrs. Haldane never thought of the vicar, never
      heard his name mentioned without at the same time unconsciously recalling&mdash;or
      rather without having flashed upon her a mental picture not only of that
      little wood near the moss, but of the romantic shore at Seacombe. She felt
      a strange tender interest in the man who had loved her so long, and still
      loved her so hopelessly, so unselfishly. Hitherto in their relationship
      she had only thought of herself, of her own needs and her own happiness.
      She had looked up to him. But that avowal had changed their position
      towards one another in a singular way. He to whom every one felt entitled
      to appeal to for advice, assistance, consolation, was evidently himself in
      need of human affection. She had hitherto regarded the priest rather than
      the man, but now the man chiefly engaged her attention, and attracted her
      sympathy while he excited and perplexed her imagination. What could she do
      to be of service to him? She set her woman's wit to work in a woman's way,
      and speedily arrived at one means of serving him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "George," she said to her husband one morning at breakfast, "I have been
      thinking of asking an old schoolfellow of mine, Hettie Taylor, to come and
      spend a few weeks with us. She lives in London, and she will be delighted
      with the change to the country, I know. What do you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beginning to feel lonely already?" he asked, glancing up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no, not at all. Only I have been thinking of her, and should like to
      have her with me again for a little while. I am sure you will like her.
      She is very pretty&mdash;such beautiful brown hair and eyes&mdash;and
      decidedly intellectual."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask her by all means, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks. I will write to her to-day. No, not to-day&mdash;I shall be busy
      seeing after the children's picnic. Will you not come, dear? You know you
      love children."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To a picnic, my dear girl!" cried Mr. Haldane aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, in Barton Wood. The children are all going in a couple of waggons.
      And there will be some of the old people there if the weather is fine. Do
      come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A picnic, my dear Nell, is pure atavism&mdash;it is one of those lapses
      into savagery which betray the aboriginal arboreal blood," said Mr.
      Haldane, laughing. "No, no; I have too much respect for the civilization
      of the century and for my personal comfort to willingly retrograde to the
      Drift Period."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X. THE KISS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he artist in
      search of a pretty rural subject could not do better than paint a village
      holiday&mdash;a holiday from which the men and women are all but excluded,
      and the village school-children and the old people are gathered together
      for a voyage through the leafy lanes to the picturesque playground of a
      neighbouring wood. Such an enjoyable spectacle as that presented on the
      day of the Omberley school-treat deserved to be immortalized by art, if
      only for the sake of filling a city parlour with a sense of eternal
      summer. It was a glorious August morning that laughed out over Omberley on
      the day of the great picnic. The young people were astir early, for it had
      been impossible to sleep from the excitement they felt after the first
      glimmer of dawn. About ten o'clock the streets were gay with troops of
      children, clean, rosy-cheeked, and dressed in their Sunday clothes, who
      went singing to the rendezvous at the schoolhouse. There they were
      received by Miss Dora Greatheart, who inspected them all, and expressed
      her approbation at finding them so neat and prim. In twos and threes the
      old people, the men in tall hats and swallow-tailed coats for the most
      part, and the women in their best black gowns and church bonnets, came
      slowly along the road, gossiping and laughing and breathing hard with the
      weakness of old age. Then came the musicians&mdash;old Gabriel Ware, the
      sexton, with his fiddle, and two younger men, one of whom played the
      concertina and the other the cornopean, each with a huge nosegay in his
      breast and wearing the jauntiest air conceivable. There was a happy buzz
      of excitement about the schoolhouse as the people assembled; a joyous
      babble of the clear treble voices of little lads and lasses, and the
      piping notes of garrulous patriarchs and ancient dames; a strange picture,
      as pathetic as it was pretty, of bright young faces and dancing little
      figures mingling among gray wrinkled visages and frail stooping shapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Dora, we are to have a fine day," said Edith, as she entered the
      garden and shook hands with the schoolmistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendid; only we shall be a little late in starting. We should have been
      off at ten, and the waggons have not come yet. Why, here is old Daddy
      coming!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had stepped out to the road to look for the waggons, and now she went
      to welcome the new arrival whom she called Daddy. He was a very old, very
      wiry little man, with a funny little face full of wrinkles, a pair of
      little grey eyes, and a perfectly bald head. This was the oldest
      inhabitant of Omberley; and though he was in his ninety-second year, he
      was as brisk and hearty as many who were twenty years his juniors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Daddy, you have actually come!" said Dora, shaking hands with him.
      "I am very glad. And how do you feel to-day? Pretty strong and hearty?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strong as Samson, mistress, and hearty as&mdash;hearty as anything,"
      replied the old man, with a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please, miss," said a young woman who accompanied him, "mother sends her
      duty, and will you kindly take care of him and see as he doesn't go
      a-thinking."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daddy's only symptom of senility was an aptitude to fall into a state of
      unconsciousness, and in these cases, which sometimes lasted for hours
      together, he would sit down wherever he was, and consequently ran
      considerable risks when he went out-of-doors alone. Though the old fellow
      was quite unable to give any account of himself during these lapses into
      oblivion, he always stoutly declared that he had been only thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And please, miss, you'll find his bacca-box and his pipe in his tail
      pocket, and his hankercher, and the matches is in his vest pocket. He do
      forget where he puts his things."
    </p>
    <p>
      Daddy laughed scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never forgets nothing, I don't," he said boastingly. "I can mind o' the
      great beech as was blown down on the green in the whirlywind of '92; ay, I
      mind&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud cheer from the school children interrupted the flow of Daddy's
      reminiscences. The greeting was intended for the vicar and the patroness
      of the festival, Mrs. Haldane, who now drove up to the school-house. She
      was already acquainted with Dora, but she had not yet met either Edith or
      the oldest inhabitant. Mr. Santley introduced both as the waggons came in
      sight, and at once the cheering was renewed, and the children streamed out
      into the road. What a fine sight those waggons were v&mdash;the long,
      curved, wheeled ships of the inland farmer, painted yellow and red, and
      drawn by big horses, with huge collars and bright iron chains! The
      semicircular canvas awning had been removed, but the wooden arches which
      supported it were wreathed with leaves and flowers, and festoons hung
      overhead between arch and arch. The horses, too, were gaily decked out,
      each having a nosegay between its ears, and its mane and tail tied up with
      ribbons. The bottom of the waggons were covered with trusses of straw, to
      make comfortable seats for the old folk. The more daring of the lads were
      already clambering up the wheels, and securing seats on the flakes which
      went along the sides of the rustic ship like a sort of outrigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before allowing Daddy to be helped on board, Miss Greatheart beckoned to
      her a little pale-faced girl who was obliged to use crutches.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nannie dear, I want you to look after Daddy as much as you can. When you
      are tired of him you must come and tell me. Don't let him go away by
      himself, and wake him up if he sleeps too long."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was said in a whisper to the child, who smiled and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Daddy, here's little Nannie Swales," said Dora; "I want you to take
      care of her. You're the only person I can trust to look after her
      properly. And she likes to talk to you and see you smoke."
    </p>
    <p>
      The little old man smiled and chuckled complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put her aside of me, mistress, and I'll see as no ill comes to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      What could have been more charmingly idyllic than those two great waggons,
      crowded with little shining-eyed tots, merry lads and lasses, withered old
      men and women, all happy and contented? The blue sky laughed down on them;
      the green leaves and flowers embowered them; and as a start was; made, one
      of the musicians struck up "For we'll a-hunting go" on the concertina, and
      a score of clear, fresh voices joined in the jovial song.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the village, which turned out to wave hands to them as they passed
      singing and cheering, away through gold-green stretches of ripening
      harvest, past empty fields where the hay had all been cut and carted,
      between level expanses of root crops lying green in the hot sun, till at
      last the dark embankment of Barton Wood rises above the distant sky. How
      cool and refreshing it is, after the glare of the midday sun, to get into
      the green shadowland of these grand old beeches and sycamores!
    </p>
    <p>
      The road winds leisurely as if to seek out the coolest recesses of the
      wood, and beneath the great bunches of heavy foliage, what quiet, dim
      distances one sees between the trunks, strewn thick with withered leaves,
      through which the moss and grass and a thousand moist plants thrust their
      emerald way, and blue and pink and yellow flowers are clustered in
      cushions of velvet colour! A few yards away from the road the air seems
      brown and transparent. That must be the reason why the leaves of the
      mountain ash are so darkly green, and the berries so brilliantly crimson.
      If you pluck a bunch and take it out of the wood, you will find it has
      become disenchanted; the colour is no longer the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road is not a highway, but leads to an old quarry of brown sandstone.
      There has been no work done here for a few years, but many generations of
      stonemasons have plied hammer and chisel in this picturesque workshop. It
      is a tradition that the stone of Foxglove Manor, old as it is, was got
      here. The old church was built from these brown walls of stone; so was the
      Vicarage, and so were the windowsills and facings of all the houses in
      Omberley. It is an unusually large quarry, for a great deal of stone has
      been taken away during these two hundred odd years. A great deal of
      half-shaped stone lies about in large square and oblong blocks, both on
      the floor of the quarry, and among the trees at its entrance. The trees
      must have sprung up since many of these blocks were cut, otherwise it is
      not easy to see why they should have been put where you now find them. On
      two sides the walls of rock are high and precipitous, but on the others
      the grass and ferns and beeches are carried into the quarry as on the
      swell of a green wave. A stone shed and hut, roofed with red tiles, stand
      at the foot of one of these slopes, and here the commissariat department
      has established itself. A romantic, green, cosy, convenient spot for a
      picnic and a dance!
    </p>
    <p>
      The waggons were driven right into the quarry, and the horses were hobbled
      and allowed to graze beneath the trees. The hour before dinner was spent
      in wandering through the woods gathering flowers and berries, in rolling
      about on the soft grass, or in smoking and chatting among the blocks of
      sandstone. When the cornopean sounded the signal for the feast, the
      youngsters came trooping in, dancing and eager to begin, for the
      excitement had prevented most of them from taking breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what a luxurious feast it was The vicar, Mrs. Haldane, Edith, and Miss
      Greatheart, went about the various groups seeing that every one was well
      supplied with what they liked best. After the cold meats, pies, and
      pastry, came a liberal distribution of fruit and milk to the children, and
      a glass of wine to the old people; and at this point Daddy was made the
      object of so much nudging and whispering and signalling, that at last he
      got upon his feet and made a wonderful little speech on behalf of the
      company, keeping his wine-glass in his hand all the time, and every now
      and then holding it up between his eye and the light with the shrewd air
      of a connoisseur. Then there were three cheers for Mrs. Haldane, and three
      cheers for the vicar, three for Dora and for Edith, and happily some young
      rascal, whose milk had been too strong for him, proposed in a frightened
      scream three cheers for. Daddy, which were very heartily given by all the
      school children, though the seniors looked much shocked and surprised at
      so daring a demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about an hour the racing and games were to begin, and meanwhile Mrs.
      Haldane, the vicar, and the two young ladies were to have lunch together.
      It is not necessary to enter into any detail of the various sports which
      took place, or to linger over the dancing and merrymaking that followed.
      When the fun was at its height, and Daddy was capering gaily to the
      jigging of the small orchestra, Edith, who felt only half interested,
      slipped quietly away into the wood. She was not surprised or aggrieved
      that Mr. Santley paid so much attention to the lady of the Manor, but she
      felt hurt that he seemed so completely to forget and overlook herself. She
      wished now to be a little alone in Arden, for Edith loved the woods, and
      in every glade she could imagine in her fanciful moments that Jaques, or
      Rosalind, or Touchstone had just gone by, so closely had she associated
      the dramatic idyl with every piece of English forest-land.
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed at haphazard a foot-track that went through the trees until
      she reached a brook, which she found she could cross by means of three
      slippery-looking stepping-stones, against which the water bickered and
      gurgled as it raced along. All the steep banks were knee-deep in beautiful
      ferns close by the waters edge, and higher up the slope grew luxurious
      tufts of wild flowers. The sound of-the water was very pleasant to hear,
      and when she had nimbly jumped across it, instead of following the path,
      she went up the side of the stream to where a mountain ash leaned its
      dense clusters of blood-bright berries right across. At the foot of the
      tree was a large boulder, and, after a glance round her, she sat down and
      drew off her shoes and stockings. The weather was warm, and the clear,
      sun-flecked water was irresistibly inviting. There she sat for some time,
      dreamily paddling with her little white feet, like a pretty dryad whose
      tree grew in too dry a soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had finished playing with the cool stream, and was letting her feet
      dry in the patches of sunlight that pierced through the branches above
      her, when she heard a sound of voices. She hastily tried to draw on her
      stockings, but her skin was still too moist; and so, gathering her feet
      under her skirt, she concealed herself as much as possible from the
      observation of the intruders. As they approached she recognized the voices
      with a start, and crouched down behind the boulder more closely than
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can go no further this way," said Mrs. Haldane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh yes, we can. I will assist you over the stones," the vicar rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They look very treacherous and slippery, and the water makes one nervous,
      running so fast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look, it is quite safe!" said the vicar; and Edith, peeping from the side
      of the boulder, saw him step quickly across the brook. "It is a pity you
      should miss the old Roman camp, when you are so near it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will come back and assist me from this side, I will try them,"
      said Mrs. Haldane..
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar returned across the brook, and Edith saw the lady gather her
      dress and prepare to step on to the first stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, you must be ready to reach me your hand in case I need it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you will find it quite easy when you try. Don't stop, but go right
      across without hesitation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Haldane jumped fairly enough on to the first boulder, but, instead of
      allowing the forward impetus to carry her on, she tried to stop and steady
      herself on the narrow footing among the rushing water. She lost at once
      her balance and her courage, and turning to him with outstretched arms,
      she cried out, "Quick! quick! I shall fall!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw herself back to the side as she spoke, and he caught her in his
      arms. Her arms were about his neck, her face close to his; he felt her
      breath upon his cheek. It was only for an instant, and as she tried to
      recover herself, their eyes met with a flash of self-consciousness. In the
      passionate excitement of that supreme moment he strained her to his
      breast, and pressed his lips to her in a long, violent kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith sprang to her feet as though she had been stung; but instantly she
      recollected herself, and sank down into her hiding-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Haldane tore herself from the arms that encircled her, and fronted
      the vicar with a flushed, angry face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you mad, Mr. Santley?" she asked indignantly. "Allow me to pass at
      once."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood aside trembling, white, and speechless; and she swept by him and
      hurried back through the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar looked after her, but stood as if rooted to the spot; while
      Edith, heedless of the hard stones and her naked feet, ran down wildly to
      the stepping-stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned as she approached, and there, with the water whirling between
      them, she confronted him like his outraged conscience.

      CHAPTER XI. EDITH.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      |Is this your fidelity? is this your love?" she asked bitterly.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The deadly pallor of the vicars face had given place to a flush of guilt
      and shame. He crossed the brook and stood beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Edith, I have done wrong. Can you forgive me?" he asked, attempting to
      take her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not touch me, Mr. Santley!" she exclaimed, stepping back from him. "Do
      not speak to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you not forgive me, Edith?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask God to forgive you. It matters little now whether I forgive or not.
      Please go away and leave me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot leave you in this manner. Say you forgive. I confess I have done
      wrong, but it was in the heat of passion, it was not premeditated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The heat of passion! Was it only in the heat of passion that you&mdash;&mdash;
      Oh, go at once, Mr. Santley! Go before I say what had better be left
      unspoken!" The vicar paused and looked at her anxiously; but Edith,
      throwing her shoes and stockings on the ground, sat down on a stone, and
      resting her pale, unhappy face on her hands, gazed with a hard, fixed
      expression at the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dearest Edith, try to believe that what I did was only an act of
      momentary madness; blame me if you will, for I cannot too severely blame
      myself, but do not look so relentless and unforgiving."
    </p>
    <p>
      She never stirred or gave any indication that she had heard him, but sat
      staring at the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be sorry for your unkindness afterwards," he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paid no heed to him, and he saw it was hopeless to try to effect a
      reconciliation at the present moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since you command me to go, I will go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still she appeared not to have heard him. He went back across the brook,
      and, glancing back once or twice, disappeared in the wood. A minute or two
      later he stole back again, and saw that she was still sitting by the brook
      in the same stony attitude. A vague sense of uneasiness took possession of
      him. He knew that even the meekest, frailest, and gentlest of women are
      capable of the most tragic extremities when under the sway of passion. Yet
      what could he do? She would not speak to him, and was deaf to all he could
      say in extenuation of his conduct. Trusting to the effect of a little
      quiet reflection, and to the love which he knew she felt for him, he
      resolved at length to leave her to herself. After all he had, it seemed to
      him, more to fear from Mrs. Haldane than from Edith. To what frightful
      consequences he had exposed himself by that act of folly! Would she tell
      her husband? Would the story leak out and become the scandal of the
      country side? With a sickening dread of what the future had in store for
      him, he retraced his steps to the quarry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Haldane's first impulse was to order her carriage and at once drive
      home, but her hurried walk through the wood gradually became slower as she
      reflected on the strange interpretation that would be put upon so sudden a
      departure. She had brought the vicar, and if she now hastened away without
      him, evil tongues would soon be busied with both her name and his. For the
      sake of the office he held, and for her own sake as well, she resolved to
      be silent on what had happened. She felt sure that the vicar would be
      sufficiently punished by the stings of his own conscience, and if any
      future chastisement were required he should find it in her distance and
      frigid treatment of him. Consequently, when Mrs. Haldane reached the
      quarry she assumed a cheerful, friendly air, stopped to say a few kind
      words to the old people, and interested herself in the amusements of the
      children. It was now drawing near tea-time, and the sun was westering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Santley felt relieved when he found that Mrs. Haldane had not abruptly
      left, as he dreaded she would do, but he made no attempt to speak to her
      or attract her attention. At tea-time she took a cup in her hand and
      joined a group of little girls, instead of taking her place at the table
      set aside for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar's eye glanced restlessly about for Edith, but she had not obeyed
      the summons of the cornopean, and in the bustle and excitement, her
      absence was not noticed. It was only when the horses had been put into the
      shafts, and the children, after being counted, were taking their places in
      the waggons, that Miss Greatheart missed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you seen Miss Dove, Mr. Santley?" she asked, after she had searched
      in vain through the little crowd for Edith. "I don't think she was at
      tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She went in the direction of the old camp," replied the#vicar, hurriedly;
      "she cannot have heard the signal. Do not say anything. I think I shall be
      easily able to find her. If Mrs. Haldane asks for me, will you say I have
      gone to look for her? You can start as soon as you are ready; we shall
      easily overtake you."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Mr. Santley plunged into the wood, and hurried to the brook.
      Edith was still sitting where he had left her, but she had in the
      meanwhile put on her shoes and stockings. Instead of the fixed, determined
      expression, her face now wore a look of intense wretchedness, and
      evidently she had been crying. She looked up at the sound of his
      footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Edith, we are going home," he said, as he reached the edge of the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can go," was the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But not without you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, without me. I am not going home. I am never going home any more. I
      have no home. Oh! mother, mother!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The last words were uttered in a low, sobbing voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, you must not speak like that. You must go home. What would
      your poor aunt say if you did anything so foolish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, what would she say if she knew how I have disgraced her and myself?
      No, I cannot go home any more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you cannot stay here all night," said the vicar, with a chill,
      sinking tremor at the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Edith, my dear girl, for God's sake do not say you are thinking of doing
      anything rash!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What else can I do? What else am I fit for but disgrace and a miserable
      end? Oh, Mr. Santley, you swore to me that before God I was your true
      wife. I believed you then. I did not think you were only acting in a
      moment of passion. But now I see that it was a dreadful sin. I was not
      your wife; and oh! what have you made me instead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very pale, and he trembled from head to foot as he listened to her
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not speak so loud," he said in a hoarse whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! do you feel ashamed? Are you afraid of any one knowing? But God
      knows it now, and my poor, poor mother knows it&mdash;God help me!&mdash;and
      all the world will know it some day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Edith, you will not ruin me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you not ruined me? Have you not cast me off for a woman who does not
      even care for you&mdash;for another man's wife? Oh no, do not be afraid. I
      will take my shame with me in silence. No one shall be able to say a word
      against you now, but all the world will know at the last."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Edith, listen to me. I will tell you everything; I will hide nothing from
      you; but do not condemn me unheard. All that I said to you was true, and
      is still true. Till <i>she</i> came, I did really and most truly love you
      with all my heart and soul. You were my very wife, in God's eyes, if love
      and truth be, as they are, what makes the validity of marriage. I did not
      deceive you; I did not speak in a moment of passion. Before Heaven I took
      you for my wife, and before Heaven I believed myself your husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then she came!" interposed Edith, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then she came. I have told you all she was to me once, all I hoped
      she would one day be. But I have not told you how I have struggled to be
      true to you in every word and thought. It has been a hard and a bitter
      struggle&mdash;all the more hard and bitter that I have failed. I confess,
      Edith, that I have not been true. But are we all sinless? are we perfect?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can at least be honourable. Your love of her is a crime."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her beauty maddens me. She is my evil angel. To see her is to love her
      and long for her. And instead of helping me to conquer temptation, instead
      of trying to save me from myself, you cast me from you, you upbraid my
      weakness, you taunt me with your unhappiness. When she is not near, my
      better nature turns to you. You help me to believe in God, in goodness;
      she drives me to unbelief and atheism. Did you fancy I was a saint? Have
      not I my passions and temptations as well as other men? Even the just man
      falls seven times a day; if you indeed loved me as a true wife, you would
      find it in your heart to forgive even unto seventy times seven."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know how I have loved!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Have</i> loved! Ay, and how easily you have ceased to love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; I have never ceased to love you. It is because I must still love
      and love you that I am so wretched."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then how can you be so unforgiving?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I am not unforgiving. I can forgive you anything, so long as I know
      that I am dear to you. Seven and seventy-seven times."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you forgive me now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do. But you will never any more&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must help me not to; you must pray for me, and assist me to be ever
      faithful to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will, I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew her to him, and kissed her on the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you will come home now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The waggons have started, and we must walk quickly to overtake them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't care now how far we have to walk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Haldane, however, may have waited for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Edith stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't go near her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Consider a moment, darling. She knows nothing about you, and she does not
      know that you know anything about her. It might look strange if she drove
      home without me, after bringing me here. I feared at first that she would
      have left instantly, but she did not. She may not wish to give people any
      reason for talking about any sudden coolness between us. Do you understand
      me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I will go."
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar had correctly divined the course Mrs. Haldane had pursued. When
      she learned that Mr. Santley had gone in search of Edith, she drove very
      leisurely along, so that they might overtake her. She had just got clear
      of the wood when, on looking round, she observed them coming through the
      trees. She drew up till they reached her; and when they had got in, she
      started a brisk conversation with Edith on all manner of topics. She was
      in her liveliest mood, and to Edith it seemed almost incredible that the
      scene she had witnessed at the brook was a very serious fact, and not an
      hallucination. Edith noticed, however, that the vicar seldom spoke, and
      that, though Mrs. Haldane listened and answered when he made any remark,
      the conversation was between Mrs. Haldane and herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At parting Mrs. Haldane gave him her finger-tips, and was apparently
      paying more attention to Edith when she said good-bye to him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII. CONSCIENCE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>rs. Haldane came
      no more to the Vicarage that week, and on Sunday she did not remain, as
      she had hitherto done, for the communion at the close of the morning
      service. She was evidently deeply offended, and was doing all she could to
      avoid meeting the vicar. With him that week had been one of terrible
      conflict. Tortured with remorse and shame, he was still mad with passion.
      That kiss was still burning on his lips. He still could feel that
      voluptuous form in his arms. It seemed, indeed, as though Mrs. Haldane
      were his evil genius, driving him on to destruction. He was unable to
      pray; and when he sat down to prepare his sermon, her face rose between
      him and the paper, and, starting up, he rushed from the house and walked
      rapidly away into the country. This was in the forenoon, and he walked on
      and on at a quick pace for several hours. He passed little hamlets and
      farmsteads which he did not notice, for his mind was absorbed in a
      wretchedness so intense that he scarcely was conscious of what he was
      doing. In the afternoon he came to a wood, and, worn out with fatigue and
      agitation, he entered it and flung himself beneath the shadow of a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he lay, a prey to conscience, till the sun went down. He had had no
      food since morning, and he was now weak and nervous. He returned from the
      wood to the high-road and retraced his steps homeward. As he passed by the
      wayside cottages, he was tempted once or twice to stop and ask for bread
      and milk, but after a mental contest he each time conquered the pangs of
      hunger and thirst, and went on again. The fathers of the desert had
      subdued the lusts of the flesh by hunger and stripes and physical
      suffering, and if mortification could exorcise the evil spirit within him,
      he would have no mercy on himself. He was a great distance from home, and,
      notwithstanding his resolution to suffer and endure, he was several times
      forced to sit down and rest on heaps of broken stones by the wayside; and
      on one of these occasions a spray of bramble-berries hanging over the
      hedge caught his eye, and looked so rich and sweet that he plucked one and
      raised it to his mouth. The next moment, however, he had flung it away
      from him. On another occasion he was startled to his feet by the sound of
      wheels, and as he walked on he was overtaken by a neighbouring farmer in
      his gig, who drew up as he was passing, and touched his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Making for home, Mr. Santley?" he asked, as he shook up the cushion on
      the vacant seat beside him. "I can put you down at your own door, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Mr. Henderson; I prefer walking, and I have some business to
      attend to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, sir. It's a fine evening for a walk. Good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar watched the gig diminish on the distant road till at length the
      hedgerows concealed it, with a certain sense of stoical satisfaction. He
      felt he was not all weakness; there was yet left some power of
      self-denial, some fortitude to endure self-inflicted chastisement.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly dark when he arrived again in Omberley. The windows were
      ruddy with fire and gaslight; there were no children playing in the
      streets; several of the small shopkeepers who kept open late, were now at
      last putting up their shutters. There was a genial glow from the
      red-curtained window of the village inn, and a sound of singing and
      merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should I not go in and join them?" he thought to himself. "What an
      effect it would have, if I stepped into the sanded taproom and called for
      a pipe and a quart of beer! The vicar smoking a long clay, with his
      frothing pewter on the deal table beside him! Why not? Has not the vicar
      his gross appetites as well as you? Why should you be scandalized,
      friends, if he should indulge in the same merry way as yourselves? Is he
      not a mere man like you, with the same animal needs and cravings? Fools,
      who shrink with horror from the humanity of a man because he wears a black
      coat and talks to you of duty and sacrifice and godliness! How little you
      know the poor wretch to whom you look for counsel and comfort and
      mediation with Heaven!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was turning away, when the taproom door was flung open, and half a
      dozen tipsy men, cursing and quarrelling, staggered out into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among them was a handsome, swarthy girl of two and twenty, gaily dressed
      in colours, with a coloured handkerchief bound over her black hair, and a
      guitar in her hand. They were evidently quarrelling about the girl, who
      was doing her best to make peace among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You does me no good by your fighting and kicking up a row, masters.
      Decent folks won't let a wench into the house when there's always a fight
      got up about her. You spoils my market, and gets me an ill name, masters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any way, Jack Haywood shan't lay a finger on thee, Sal!" cried a burly
      young fellow, deep in his cups, as he clenched his horny fist and shook it
      at Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is't to you what Jack does?" returned the girl, saucily. "Neither
      Jack nor thee shall lay a finger on me against my will. I reckon I can
      take care o' myself, masters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, ay, thou canst that!" assented several voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicar, who had stood to witness this scene, now stepped in among the
      group. The men recognized him, and, touching their forelocks, slunk away
      in sheepish silence. He uttered not a word, but his pale face sobered them
      like a dash of cold water. Only the girl was left, and she stood, red and
      frightened, while her hands were nervously busied with the guitar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are back again, Sal, and at your old ways," said the vicar, in a low
      voice. "I see, all good advice and all encouragement are wasted on you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't help it, sir," said the girl, sullenly. "I was born bad; I'm of a
      bad lot. It's no use trying any more. It's in the blood and the bone, and
      it'll come out, in spite of everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you made much to-day?" asked the vicar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A shilling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going to stop tonight?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At old Mary Henson's, in Bara Street."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, go home at once, Sal," said the vicar, giving her a half-crown.
      "Will you promise me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you will speak to no man tonight? You promise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the girl, taking the money, with a strange look of inquiry at
      the vicar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And try to say your prayers before you go to sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl dropped a curtsy, and went slowly down the street. With a bitter
      laugh, the vicar pursued his way homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the blood and the bone! In the blood and the bone!" he; repeated to
      himself. "You are right, girl; we are born bad&mdash;born bad. The bestial
      madness of ages and aeons, the lust and lasciviousness of countless
      generations, are still in our blood, and our instincts are still the
      instincts of the beast and the savage. Hypocrite and blasphemer that I am!
      Whited sepulchre, reeking with corruption! Living lie and mask of
      holiness! O God, what a wretch am I, who dare, to speak of purity and
      repentance to this woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the Vicarage, his sister was anxiously awaiting him, and
      supper was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where have you been so long?" she asked, a little impatiently. "I think
      you might leave word when you expect to be detained beyond your usual
      time. It is eleven o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could not say how long I should be," replied the vicar, with a weary
      look, which touched his sister and changed her ill-temper to solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are quite tired out, poor fellow," she said, laying her hand on his
      shoulder. "Well, come to supper. It is ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot take anything at present," replied Mr. Santley. "I will, go and
      do a little of my sermon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I leave something out for you, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, please. Good night."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into the study, lit the gas, and, locking the door, flung himself
      into an armchair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the blood! in the blood!" he bitterly communed with himself. "And,
      with all our wild dreams and aspirations, we are but what science says we
      are, the conqueror of the lascivious ape, the offspring of some common
      ancestral bestiality, which transmitted to the simian its animalism free
      and unfettered except by appetite, and to man the germs of a moral law
      which must be for ever at variance with his sensual instincts. God! we are
      worse than apes&mdash;we the immortals, with our ideals of spirit and
      purity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, and going across the room to the tall, carved oak cupboard, whose
      contents were a secret to all but himself, he unlocked it and opened the
      folding doors. The light fell on a large, beautiful statue of the Madonna,
      with the Infant Christ in her arms. The figure was in plaster, exquisitely
      coloured, and of a rare loveliness. He looked at it abstractedly for a
      long while.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother of God!" he exclaimed at length, with passionate fervour.
      "Spotless virgin, woman above all women glorified, the solitary boast of
      our tainted nature&mdash;oh, dream and desire of men striving for their
      lost innocence, how vainly have I worshipped and prayed to thee! How
      ardently have I believed in thy immaculate motherhood! How yearningly I
      have cried to thee for thy aid and intercession! And no answer has been
      granted to my supplications. My feverish exaltation has passed from me,
      leaving me weak and at the mercy of my senses. Art thou, too, but a poetic
      myth of a later superstition&mdash;an idealization more beautiful, more
      divine than the frail goddesses of Greece and Rome? The art and poetry of
      the world have turned to thee for inspiration, the ascetic has filled the
      cold cell with the shining vision of thee, altars have been raised to thee
      over half the globe, the prayers of nations ascend to thee, and art thou
      but a beautiful conception of the heart, powerless to aid or to hear thy
      suppliants?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, as if, indeed, he expected some sign or word in answer to his
      wild appeal. Then, closing the doors again and locking them, he went
      towards his-desk. On it lay the manuscript of the sermon he had preached
      on the Unknown God.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Unknown God!" he exclaimed. "What if her husband is right! What if,
      indeed, there be no God, no God for us, no God of whom we shall ever be
      conscious! All science points that way. When the man is dead, his soul is
      dead too. We deny it; but what is our denial worth? It is our interest to
      deny it. All phenomena contradict our denial. No man has ever risen from
      the grave to give us assurance of our immortality. Ah, truly, 'if there be
      no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen; and if Christ be
      not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      He paced the room excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why act the knave and the hypocrite longer? Why delude the world with a
      false hope of a future that can never be? Why preach prayer and sacrifice,
      and suffering and patience, when this life is all? If Christ is not risen,
      our preaching is vain, and your faith is also vain."
    </p>
    <p>
      He again paced the room; and then, going to a drawer where the keys of the
      church were kept, he took them, and stole noiselessly out of the house.
      All was very still outside. The stars were shining, and it was duskily
      clear. He traversed the churchyard, and reaching the porch he unlocked the
      door and entered. It was quite dark, except that the tall, narrow windows
      looked grey against the blackness of the rest of the building, and a
      little bead of flame burned in the sanctuary lamp. He closed the door
      after him, and went up the echoing nave to the chancel. Thence he groped
      his way to the pulpit, and ascending he looked down into the darkness
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood there in silence, straining his eyes into the gloom, and
      gradually there came out of the darkness faint, spectral rows of faces,
      turned up to his with a horrified and bewildered aspect. He uttered no
      word, but in his brain he was preaching from the text of Paul, and proving
      that Christ, indeed, had never risen, and that their faith was vain. This
      world was all, and there was nothing beyond it. Vice and virtue were but
      social and physical distinctions, implying that the consequences of the
      one were destructive of happiness, of the other were conducive to
      happiness. Sin was a fiction, and the sense of sinfulness a morbid
      development of the imagination. Every man was a law unto himself, and that
      law must be obeyed. A mans actions were the outcome of his constitution.
      He was not morally responsible for them. Indeed, moral responsibility was
      a philosophical error. In dumb show was that long, phrenzied sermon
      preached to a phantom congregation. At the close the vicar, omitting the
      usual form of benediction, descended from the pulpit, staggered across the
      chancel, and fell in a swoon at the foot of the steps which led to the
      altar.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII. IN THE LABORATORY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he grey dawn was
      glimmering through the chancel when Mr. Santley regained consciousness. He
      looked wonderingly about him, and at first was unable to understand how he
      came to be in his present position. That physical collapse had been a
      merciful relief from a state of mental tension which had become
      intolerable. He felt faint but calm, and the horrible excitement of the
      last few hours presented itself to his memory as a sort of ghastly
      nightmare from which he had been providentially awakened.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and went out into the churchyard. The air was moist and cool. A
      strange white mist lay in fantastic pools and streaks on the bare
      hayfields. The corn was full of an indistinct white gauzy vapour. So were
      the trees. There was not much of it in the open air. It had a spectral
      look, and, like spirits, it seemed to require some material thing to
      interpenetrate and rest upon. The grass was heavy with dew, and the
      gravelled walk as dark coloured as though there had been rain. From the
      corn came the sound of innumerable chirpings and twitterings. The fields
      seemed to be swarming with sweet, sharp musical notes. In the trees, too,
      though there was no stir of wings, there was a very tumult of bird-song&mdash;not
      the full, joyous outpouring, but a ceaseless orchestral tuning up and
      rehearsing as it were. The familiar graveyard in this unusual misty light,
      and alive with this strange music, seemed a place in which ne had never
      been before. The effect was as novel as the first appearance of a
      well-known landscape buried in snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newness of what was so familiar excited an indefinable interest in
      him. He felt somehow as though he had passed through the valley of the
      shadow, and this was the day after death&mdash;that death by which we
      shall not all die, but by which we and all things shall be changed. He
      lingered in that mental state in which thought expands beyond the bounds
      of consciousness, and it was not till a low, faint flush of red began to
      colour the east that he returned to the Vicarage, and, throwing himself on
      his bed, fell into the deep, dreamless sleep of exhaustion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fortunate for Mr. Santley that he had inherited a magnificent
      constitution, or the consequences of this wild conflict might have been
      disastrous. He woke late, but the brief period of rest and unconsciousness
      had repaired the reckless waste of nervous force. Only a profound sadness
      remained as a testimony of the terrible nature of the emotion he had
      endured. The rest of the week passed in a sort of weary, listless stupor
      and the same heavy sadness. When Sunday came round, he shuddered as he
      ascended the pulpit at the recollection of that phantasmal audience to
      which he had last preached; but his intellect was clear and sane, and he
      kept faithfully to the written discourse spread out before him. He was not
      surprised that Mrs. Haldane left before he had any opportunity of speaking
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had half expected as much. She regarded him with a cold, haughty
      contempt&mdash;a contempt too passionless to permit her even to avenge the
      insult he had offered her by exposing him to his parishioners. She knew he
      loved her&mdash;and indeed was not this folly proof of the frantic
      character of his love?&mdash;and she knew that total loss of her would be
      the greatest chastisement even vindictiveness could wish to inflict upon
      him. It would have been possible for him, he thought, to bear in silence
      any punishment from her except this icy contempt and utter indifference.
      If she had hated him, if she had pursued him with bitter hostility, if she
      had disgraced him, he could have endured it; it would have been no more
      than he merited. But that she should simply ignore him, that she should
      not consider it worth her while even to be angry, was an intolerable
      humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of all, he still loved her! It was useless to seek to delude
      himself into any belief to the contrary. He loved her, in defiance of
      honour, goodness; in spite of misery and shame; in spite of divine or
      human law; in spite of man or God. He loved her with a mad, despairing
      passion, which he might conceal from all eyes for a little while, but
      which he could never quell; which he felt would some day break out in a
      frantic paroxysm that would involve both him and her in a common ruin.
      Home, position, reputation, this life and the next&mdash;he could
      sacrifice all for her. He could not exist without her. To see her and be
      never seen by her was a living hell. If he were, indeed, to be for ever
      doomed to this misery, better that he should perish at once, and have done
      for ever with the torture of being.
    </p>
    <p>
      This alternative presented itself to the vicar not merely as one of those
      exaggerated expressions of feeling common to many men in moments of
      unendurable pain or depression, but as a sober reality. An existence in
      which Mrs. Haldane took no part and shared no interest was literally to
      him an existence more hateful than self-destruction itself. On the Monday
      he proceeded to the neighbouring market town, and bought a revolver and a
      packet of cartridges. He loaded the weapon on the road, and threw the
      remaining cartridges away. That evening he spent in looking over his
      papers, a large number of which he burned. He then sat down, and wrote for
      some time; but when he had finished, he threw what he had written into the
      fire. What need was there to put any explanation on record? He then took
      from the bookcase the great poem of Lucretius, and read till a late hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning he arose early, and seemed in better spirits than he had been
      for some time. He told his sister that he was going to walk over to
      Foxglove Manor, and was not certain as to when he would return. He left
      the house, humming a tune, and set out at a brisk pace through the
      village. The weather was bright and inspiriting. The country never before
      seemed so full of health and gladness and joyous life. The lark was
      singing far up in the shining blue sky; butterflies went fluttering across
      the road; whirring flights of birds along the hedgerows preceded him all
      the way. He looked at everything and noticed everything&mdash;the bright
      flowers growing among the wayside weeds; the snail which had crept on to
      the footpath, and whose shell he carefully avoided. He observed too much
      to think; but one thought, underlying this discursive activity of mind,
      kept him company all the while&mdash;"I have struggled and prayed; I have
      tried to believe and to trust; I can do no more. If there be a God who is
      concerned in man, let him now give evidence of His providence."
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached the Manor, he was ushered into the reception-room, where
      he was not kept long waiting. Mrs. Haldane entered the apartment, and
      received him with a chilling courtesy. She noticed that, though he had
      advanced eagerly at her entrance, he had not offered her his hand; and now
      that she had bowed to him with a certain constrained grace, he stood
      regarding her hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have come," he said at last, in a low, nervous voice, "to throw myself
      on your mercy, to beg your forgiveness, to ask you once more to restore me
      your confidence and friendship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I freely forgive you, Mr. Santley," she replied at once. "It is better
      that what has taken place should be forgiven and forgotten as speedily as
      possible. But my confidence and friendship! How can I trust you any more?
      And I did trust and esteem you so much. I regarded you&mdash;&mdash; But I
      will not even reproach you with having destroyed my idealization of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reproach me and censure me as you will," he cried earnestly; "but do not
      cast me away from you, do not be heartlessly indifferent to me. It lies in
      your hands to make my life happy or miserable. It depends on you whether I
      can live at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That cannot be," replied Mrs. Haldane, shaking her head gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is and must be," said the vicar. "All my future, both here and
      hereafter, hangs on your decision now. I have fought with myself, and
      prayed to God to be delivered from my bondage; but it is in vain. No
      answer has been vouchsafed to my supplications; no grace, no strength has
      been granted in my need. Had I prayed to the deaf impersonal power which
      your husband believes in, I could not have been more hopelessly unheard or
      unheeded. The conflict is over. I am the gladiator fallen in the arena,
      and it rests with you to give the signal of reprieve or destruction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not understand you, Mr. Santley," she said, feeling alarmed and
      excited. "What do you ask? What would you have me do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, what would I have you do!" he exclaimed passionately; then, checking
      himself abruptly, he continued eagerly, "I would have you be as you were
      before I offended you. I would have you forgive my offence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have promised to forgive and forget it," said Mrs. Haldane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; do not forget it, but pardon it, and try to look upon it as more
      venial than you now do. Oh, Ellen, had I not loved you beyond all that a
      man values in this world, would it be possible to have so far fallen in
      your esteem?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She frowned, and was about to interrupt him; but he went on hurriedly&mdash;"Do
      not be angry. I will not speak to you of love again. I will only answer
      your question. I would, as I have said, that you should forgive my
      offence, and be the same to me as though it had never happened. Not only
      my use in life, my happiness, my honour depend on this, but life itself. I
      cannot exist without some share in your thoughts, in your interests, in
      your regard. Life would be intolerable if you were to be wholly taken away
      from me. Do I ask too much? Answer me quickly, for I am prepared for
      either alternative. You and God&mdash;if, indeed, there be above us a God
      who sees and cares&mdash;must now decide my course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You frighten and bewilder me with your passion. I do not know what to
      answer you. Indeed, I hardly know whether I understand you. I have
      forgiven you. I bear you no ill will. I hope, indeed, that you may be
      happy, and that you may soon find some one who will be worthier of your
      love than I could have been. I am both sorry and ashamed of what has
      happened, and I will try to forget it, both for your sake and my own. Have
      I not said enough?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the future?" he asked, with an anxious look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The future will be a continuation of the past, seeing that all is
      forgiven and forgotten."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you will still allow me to speak to you, to see you? You will not
      treat me with silence and indifference?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will be as I used to be," said Ellen, with a look of doubt and
      hesitation. "And you will <i>trust</i> me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you to be trusted, Mr. Santley?" she asked in a low voice. "You know
      how fully I trusted you before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you must trust me again if all is to be the same as it was. Is not
      that our agreement?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will try to, but the result will entirely depend upon yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot say how thankful and grateful I am to you," he said, extending
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took it, and he raised hers to his lips, though she coloured and tried
      to withdraw it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, it is but a token of my gratitude and submission. I am thankful to
      live, and you do not know how certainly you have enabled me to live."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My husband is in the laboratory," said Mrs. Haldane, who felt uneasy, and
      wished to bring this interview to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we join him?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, if you wish it."
    </p>
    <p>
      They found Mr. Haldane busily engaged in writing, while the
      sinister-looking attendant, with the dark, startling eyes, was noiselessly
      occupied in filling a number of flasks with some mysterious decoction
      intended for immediate experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ever busy!" exclaimed the vicar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Busier than ever just now," replied Mr. Haldane. "I am preparing a paper
      which I intend to read on Tuesday next before the scientific congress at
      Paris."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you going to Paris?" asked Mr. Santley, with surprise, and addressing
      the question rather to Mrs. Haldane than her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Haldane is going, but I remain here."
    </p>
    <p>
      A look of relief passed over the vicar's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what is the subject of your paper, if curiosity be pardonable?" he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it is a chapter from the great <i>opus</i> on morals. I call it 'The
      Problem of Suicide.' A singularly fascinating subject to one who has paid
      any attention to it, I assure you. Does it happen to have fallen in your
      line of study?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot say it has."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would find some curious generalizations here, in that case," said Mr.
      Haldane, pointing to the sheets of paper on his desk. "For instance, I
      suppose you would be hardly prepared to grant that suicide, which seems a
      barbarous and unenlightened act, is really an effect of civilization, or
      that an act which appears more than any other an evidence of individual
      spontaneity, is in fact the inevitable issue of universal and absolute
      social law."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am certainly not prepared to concede that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; few persons unacquainted with the subject would be. Still, the facts
      remain. The suicide who imagines he is rebelling against all law and
      asserting his individual independence, is but illustrating the coercion of
      the physical and psychical dispensation. Why, you shall not even choose
      your own weapon of destruction, or select the spot in which you shall die.
      Law will fix those apparently trivial details for you. If your suicide is
      an Englishman, for example, he will prefer hanging to cutting and
      stabbing, cutting and stabbing to drowning, drowning to poison, and poison
      to firearms. With English women the order of preference is modified. A
      third of the women, and hardly a seventh of the men, seek death by
      drowning; while a seventh of the women poison themselves, but only a
      fifteenth of the men. The ratios hold good from year to year&mdash;relatively
      at least&mdash;for suicide is largely on the increase. You should look
      into the matter for yourself. It is a most attractive social problem."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps Mr. Santley would like to look at your paper?" suggested Mrs.
      Haldane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall be very welcome to see it when I return," said the philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you very much. I have no doubt it will be extremely interesting.
      And when do you leave?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The day after to-morrow. I shall spend a day or two in London, and
      possibly a week or a fortnight in Paris. Indeed, I have some notion of
      paying a flying visit to Berlin."
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon, as the vicar returned home, he paused by a pool in one of
      the fields that skirted the high-road, and flung his revolver into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can it be possible," he asked himself, "that man has no volition, no
      independence of action; that his choice of life or death even is not a
      choice, but a predetermined issue of mechanical forces?" He watched the
      ripples die away on the water, and then resumed his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are we mere automata, accomplishing not our own wills, but the secret
      purpose of a subtle agency, of whose control we are unconscious?"

      Gradually the problem which perplexed him gave place to another wave of
      thought. His step became firmer and more elastic, and his face brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought which effected this change in his demeanour was Mr. Haldane's
      departure. What might not happen in those few days of absence? Was not Mr.
      Haldane also accomplishing an unknown, destiny? Might not this journey be
      providential? Or say, rather an unanticipated road to the great end?
      Suppose Mr. Haldane should never return!
    </p>
    <p>
      The possibilities involved in that reflection!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he thought of Mrs. Haldane. For a week, perhaps for a fortnight, she
      would be alone at the Manor. For a fortnight? Who could foretell&mdash;perhaps
      for ever!

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
