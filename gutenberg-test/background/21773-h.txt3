      I saw her only four times, but I remember them vividly; she made an
      impression upon me. I thought her very pretty and very interesting,&mdash;a
      charming specimen of a type. I am very sorry to hear of her death; and
      yet, when I think of it, why should I be sorry? The last time I saw her
      she was certainly not&mdash;But I will describe all our meetings in order.

      I.
    
    
      The first one took place in the country, at a little tea-party, one snowy
      night. It must have been some seventeen years ago. My friend Latouche,
      going to spend Christmas with his mother, had persuaded me to go with him,
      and the good lady had given in our honor the entertainment of which I
      speak. To me it was really entertaining; I had never been in the depths of
      New England at that season. It had been snowing all day, and the drifts
      were knee-high. I wondered how the ladies had made their way to the house;
      but I perceived that at Grimwinter a conversazione offering the attraction
      of two gentlemen from New York was felt to be worth an effort.
    
    
      Mrs. Latouche, in the course of the evening, asked me if I "did n't want
      to" show the photographs to some of the young ladies. The photographs were
      in a couple of great portfolios, and had been brought home by her son,
      who, like myself, was lately returned from Europe. I looked round and was
      struck with the fact that most of the young ladies were provided with an
      object of interest more absorbing than the most vivid sun-picture. But
      there was a person standing alone near the mantelshelf, and looking round
      the room with a small gentle smile which seemed at odds, somehow, with her
      isolation. I looked at her a moment, and then said, "I should like to show
      them to that young lady."
    
    
      "Oh, yes," said Mrs. Latouche, "she is just the person. She doesn't care
      for flirting; I will speak to her."
    
    
      I rejoined that if she did not care for flirting, she was, perhaps, not
      just the person; but Mrs. Latouche had already gone to propose the
      photographs to her.
    
    
      "She's delighted," she said, coming back. "She is just the person, so
      quiet and so bright." And then she told me the young lady was, by name,
      Miss Caroline Spencer, and with this she introduced me.
    
    
      Miss Caroline Spencer was not exactly a beauty, but she was a charming
      little figure. She must have been close upon thirty, but she was made
      almost like a little girl, and she had the complexion of a child. She had
      a very pretty head, and her hair was arranged as nearly as possible like
      the hair of a Greek bust, though indeed it was to be doubted if she had
      ever seen a Greek bust. She was "artistic," I suspected, so far as
      Grimwinter allowed such tendencies. She had a soft, surprised eye, and
      thin lips, with very pretty teeth. Round her neck she wore what ladies
      call, I believe, a "ruche," fastened with a very small pin in pink coral,
      and in her hand she carried a fan made of plaited straw and adorned with
      pink ribbon. She wore a scanty black silk dress. She spoke with a kind of
      soft precision, showing her white teeth between her narrow but
      tender-looking lips, and she seemed extremely pleased, even a little
      fluttered, at the prospect of my demonstrations. These went forward very
      smoothly, after I had moved the portfolios out of their corner and placed
      a couple of chairs near a lamp. The photographs were usually things I
      knew,&mdash;large views of Switzerland, Italy, and Spain, landscapes,
      copies of famous buildings, pictures, and statues. I said what I could
      about them, and my companion, looking at them as I held them up, sat
      perfectly still, with her straw fan raised to her underlip. Occasionally,
      as I laid one of the pictures down, she said very softly, "Have you seen
      that place?" I usually answered that I had seen it several times (I had
      been a great traveller), and then I felt that she looked at me askance for
      a moment with her pretty eyes. I had asked her at the outset whether she
      had been to Europe; to this she answered, "No, no, no," in a little quick,
      confidential whisper. But after that, though she never took her eyes off
      the pictures, she said so little that I was afraid she was bored.
      Accordingly, after we had finished one portfolio, I offered, if she
      desired it, to desist. I felt that she was not bored, but her reticence
      puzzled me, and I wished to make her speak. I turned round to look at her,
      and saw that there was a faint flush in each of her cheeks. She was waving
      her little fan to and fro. Instead of looking at me she fixed her eyes
      upon the other portfolio, which was leaning against the table.
    
    
      "Won't you show me that?" she asked, with a little tremor in her voice. I
      could almost have believed she was agitated.
    
    
      "With pleasure," I answered, "if you are not tired."
    
    
      "No, I am not tired," she affirmed. "I like it&mdash;I love it."
    
    
      And as I took up the other portfolio she laid her hand upon it, rubbing it
      softly.
    
    
      "And have you been here too?" she asked.
    
    
      On my opening the portfolio it appeared that I had been there. One of the
      first photographs was a large view of the Castle of Chillon, on the Lake
      of Geneva.
    
    
      "Here," I said, "I have been many a time. Is it not beautiful?" And I
      pointed to the perfect reflection of the rugged rocks and pointed towers
      in the clear still water. She did not say, "Oh, enchanting!" and push it
      away to see the next picture. She looked awhile, and then she asked if it
      was not where Bonnivard, about whom Byron wrote, was confined. I assented,
      and tried to quote some of Byron's verses, but in this attempt I succeeded
      imperfectly.
    
    
      She fanned herself a moment, and then repeated the lines correctly, in a
      soft, flat, and yet agreeable voice. By the time she had finished she was
      blushing. I complimented her and told her she was perfectly equipped for
      visiting Switzerland and Italy. She looked at me askance again, to see
      whether I was serious, and I added, that if she wished to recognize
      Byron's descriptions she must go abroad speedily; Europe was getting sadly
      dis-Byronized.
    
    
      "How soon must I go?" she asked.
    
    
      "Oh, I will give you ten years."
    
    
      "I think I can go within ten years," she answered very soberly.
    
    
      "Well," I said, "you will enjoy it immensely; you will find it very
      charming." And just then I came upon a photograph of some nook in a
      foreign city which I had been very fond of, and which recalled tender
      memories. I discoursed (as I suppose) with a certain eloquence; my
      companion sat listening, breathless.
    
    
      "Have you been very long in foreign lands?" she asked, some time
      after I had ceased.
    
    
      "Many years," I said.
    
    
      "And have you travelled everywhere?"
    
    
      "I have travelled a great deal. I am very fond of it; and, happily, I have
      been able."
    
    
      Again she gave me her sidelong gaze. "And do you know the foreign
      languages?"
    
    
      "After a fashion."
    
    
      "Is it hard to speak them?"
    
    
      "I don't believe you would find it hard," I gallantly responded.
    
    
      "Oh, I shouldn't want to speak; I should only want to listen," she said.
      Then, after a pause, she added, "They say the French theatre is so
      beautiful."
    
    
      "It is the best in the world."
    
    
      "Did you go there very often?"
    
    
      "When I was first in Paris I went every night."
    
    
      "Every night!" And she opened her clear eyes very wide. "That to me is:&mdash;"
      and she hesitated a moment&mdash;"is very wonderful." A few minutes later
      she asked, "Which country do you prefer?"
    
    
      "There is one country I prefer to all others. I think you would do the
      same."
    
    
      She looked at me a moment, and then she said softly, "Italy?"
    
    
      "Italy," I answered softly, too; and for a moment we looked at each other.
      She looked as pretty as if, instead of showing her photographs, I had been
      making love to her. To increase the analogy, she glanced away, blushing.
      There was a silence, which she broke at last by saying,&mdash;
    
    
      "That is the place which, in particular, I thought of going to."
    
    
      "Oh, that's the place, that's the place!" I said.
    
    
      She looked at two or three photographs in silence. "They say it is not so
      dear."
    
    
      "As some other countries? Yes, that is not the least of its charms."
    
    
      "But it is all very dear, is it not?"
    
    
      "Europe, you mean?"
    
    
      "Going there and travelling. That has been the trouble. I have very little
      money. I give lessons," said Miss Spencer.
    
    
      "Of course one must have money," I said, "but one can manage with a
      moderate amount."
    
    
      "I think I should manage. I have laid something by, and I am always adding
      a little to it. It's all for that." She paused a moment, and then went on
      with a kind of suppressed eagerness, as if telling me the story were a
      rare, but a possibly impure satisfaction, "But it has not been only the
      money; it has been everything. Everything has been against it I have
      waited and waited. It has been a mere castle in the air. I am almost
      afraid to talk about it. Two or three times it has been a little nearer,
      and then I have talked about it and it has melted away. I have talked
      about it too much," she said hypocritically; for I saw that such talking
      was now a small tremulous ecstasy. "There is a lady who is a great friend
      of mine; she does n't want to go; I always talk to her about it. I tire
      her dreadfully. She told me once she did n't know what would become of me.
      I should go crazy if I did not go to Europe, and I should certainly go
      crazy if I did."
    
    
      "Well," I said, "you have not gone yet, and nevertheless you are not
      crazy."
    
    
      She looked at me a moment, and said, "I am not so sure. I don't think of
      anything else. I am always thinking of it. It prevents me from thinking of
      things that are nearer home, things that I ought to attend to. That is a
      kind of craziness."
    
    
      "The cure for it is to go," I said.
    
    
      "I have a faith that I shall go. I have a cousin in Europe!" she
      announced.
    
    
      We turned over some more photographs, and I asked her if she had always
      lived at Grimwinter.
    
    
      "Oh, no, sir," said Miss Spencer. "I have spent twenty-three months in
      Boston."
    
    
      I answered, jocosely, that in that case foreign lands would probably prove
      a disappointment to her; but I quite failed to alarm her.
    
    
      "I know more about them than you might think," she said, with her shy,
      neat little smile. "I mean by reading; I have read a great deal I have not
      only read Byron; I have read histories and guidebooks. I know I shall like
      it."
    
    
      "I understand your case," I rejoined. "You have the native American
      passion,&mdash;the passion for the picturesque. With us, I think it is
      primordial,&mdash;antecedent to experience. Experience comes and only
      shows us something we have dreamt of."
    
    
      "I think that is very true," said Caroline Spencer. "I have dreamt of
      everything; I shall know it all!"
    
    
      "I am afraid you have wasted a great deal of time."
    
    
      "Oh, yes, that has been my great wickedness."
    
    
      The people about us had begun to scatter; they were taking their leave.
      She got up and put out her hand to me, timidly, but with a peculiar
      brightness in her eyes.
    
    
      "I am going back there," I said, as I shook hands with her. "I shall look
      out for you."
    
    
      "I will tell you," she answered, "if I am disappointed."
    
    
      And she went away, looking delicately agitated, and moving her little
      straw fan.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      II.
    
    
      A few months after this I returned to Europe, and some three years
      elapsed. I had been living in Paris, and, toward the end of October, I
      went from that city to Havre, to meet my sister and her husband, who had
      written me that they were about to arrive there. On reaching Havre I found
      that the steamer was already in; I was nearly two hours late. I repaired
      directly to the hotel, where my relatives were already established. My
      sister had gone to bed, exhausted and disabled by her voyage; she was a
      sadly incompetent sailor, and her sufferings on this occasion had been
      extreme. She wished, for the moment, for undisturbed rest, and was unable
      to see me more than five minutes; so it was agreed that we should remain
      at Havre until the next day. My brother-in-law, who was anxious about his
      wife, was unwilling to leave her room; but she insisted upon his going out
      with me to take a walk and recover his landlegs. The early autumn day was
      warm and charming, and our stroll through the bright-colored, busy streets
      of the old French seaport was sufficiently entertaining. We walked along
      the sunny, noisy quays, and then turned into a wide, pleasant street,
      which lay half in sun and half in shade&mdash;a French provincial street,
      that looked like an old water-color drawing: tall, gray, steep-roofed,
      red-gabled, many-storied houses; green shutters on windows and old
      scroll-work above them; flower-pots in balconies, and white-capped women
      in doorways. We walked in the shade; all this stretched away on the sunny
      side of the street and made a picture. We looked at it as we passed along;
      then, suddenly, my brother-in-law stopped, pressing my arm and staring. I
      followed his gaze and saw that we had paused just before coming to a café,
      where, under an awning, several tables and chairs were disposed upon the
      pavement The windows were open behind; half a dozen plants in tubs were
      ranged beside the door; the pavement was besprinkled with clean bran. It
      was a nice little, quiet, old-fashioned café; inside, in the
      comparative dusk, I saw a stout, handsome woman, with pink ribbons in her
      cap, perched up with a mirror behind her back, smiling at some one who was
      out of sight. All this, however, I perceived afterwards; what I first
      observed was a lady sitting alone, outside, at one of the little
      marble-topped tables. My brother-in-law had stopped to look at her. There
      was something on the little table, but she was leaning back quietly, with
      her hands folded, looking down the street, away from us. I saw her only in
      something less than profile; nevertheless, I instantly felt that I had
      seen her before.
    
    
      "The little lady of the steamer!" exclaimed my brother-in-law.
    
    
      "Was she on your steamer?" I asked.
    
    
      "From morning till night She was never sick. She used to sit perpetually
      at the side of the vessel with her hands crossed that way, looking at the
      eastward horizon."
    
    
      "Are you going to speak to her?"
    
    
      "I don't know her. I never made acquaintance with her. I was too seedy.
      But I used to watch her and&mdash;I don't know why&mdash;to be interested
      in her. She's a dear little Yankee woman. I have an idea she is a
      schoolmistress taking a holiday, for which her scholars have made up a
      purse."
    
    
      She turned her face a little more into profile, looking at the steep gray
      house-fronts opposite to her. Then I said, "I shall speak to her myself."
    
    
      "I would n't; she is very shy," said my brother-in-law.
    
    
      "My dear fellow, I know her. I once showed her photographs at a
      tea-party."
    
    
      And I went up to her. She turned and looked at me, and I saw she was in
      fact Miss Caroline Spencer. But she was not so quick to recognize me; she
      looked startled. I pushed a chair to the table and sat down.
    
    
      "Well," I said, "I hope you are not disappointed!"
    
    
      She stared, blushing a little; then she gave a small jump which betrayed
      recognition.
    
    
      "It was you who showed me the photographs, at Grimwinter!"
    
    
      "Yes, it was I. This happens very charmingly, for I feel as if it were for
      me to give you a formal reception here, an official welcome. I talked to
      you so much about Europe."
    
    
      "You did n't say too much. I am so happy!" she softly exclaimed.
    
    
      Very happy she looked. There was no sign of her being older; she was as
      gravely, decently, demurely pretty as before. If she had seemed before a
      thin-stemmed, mild-hued flower of Puritanism, it may be imagined whether
      in her present situation this delicate bloom was less apparent. Beside her
      an old gentleman was drinking absinthe; behind her the dame de comptoir
      in the pink ribbons was calling "Alcibiade! Alcibiade!" to the
      long-aproned waiter. I explained to Miss Spencer that my companion had
      lately been her shipmate, and my brother-in-law came up and was introduced
      to her. But she looked at him as if she had never seen him before, and I
      remembered that he had told me that her eyes were always fixed upon the
      eastward horizon. She had evidently not noticed him, and, still timidly
      smiling, she made no attempt whatever to pretend that she had. I stayed
      with her at the café door, and he went back to the hotel and to his
      wife. I said to Miss Spencer that this meeting of ours in the first hour
      of her landing was really very strange, but that I was delighted to be
      there and receive her first impressions.
    
    
      "Oh, I can't tell you," she said; "I feel as if I were in a dream. I have
      been sitting here for an hour, and I don't want to move. Everything is so
      picturesque. I don't know whether the coffee has intoxicated me; it 's so
      delicious."
    
    
      "Really," said I, "if you are so pleased with this poor prosaic Havre, you
      will have no admiration left for better things. Don't spend your
      admiration all the first day; remember it's your intellectual letter of
      credit. Remember all the beautiful places and things that are waiting for
      you; remember that lovely Italy!"
    
    
      "I 'm not afraid of running short," she said gayly, still looking at the
      opposite houses. "I could sit here all day, saying to myself that here I
      am at last. It's so dark and old and different."
    
    
      "By the way," I inquired, "how come you to be sitting here? Have you not
      gone to one of the inns?" For I was half amused, half alarmed, at the good
      conscience with which this delicately pretty woman had stationed herself
      in conspicuous isolation on the edge of the trottoir.
    
    
      "My cousin brought me here," she answered. "You know I told you I had a
      cousin in Europe. He met me at the steamer this morning."
    
    
      "It was hardly worth his while to meet you if he was to desert you so
      soon."
    
    
      "Oh, he has only left me for half an hour," said Miss Spencer. "He has
      gone to get my money."
    
    
      "Where is your money?"
    
    
      She gave a little laugh. "It makes me feel very fine to tell you! It is in
      some circular notes."
    
    
      "And where are your circular notes?"
    
    
      "In my cousin's pocket."
    
    
      This statement was very serenely uttered, but&mdash;I can hardly say why&mdash;it
      gave me a sensible chill At the moment I should have been utterly unable
      to give the reason of this sensation, for I knew nothing of Miss Spencer's
      cousin. Since he was her cousin, the presumption was in his favor. But I
      felt suddenly uncomfortable at the thought that, half an hour after her
      landing, her scanty funds should have passed into his hands.
    
    
      "Is he to travel with you?" I asked.
    
    
      "Only as far as Paris. He is an art-student, in Paris. I wrote to him that
      I was coming, but I never expected him to come off to the ship. I supposed
      he would only just meet me at the train in Paris. It is very kind of him.
      But he is very kind, and very bright."
    
    
      I instantly became conscious of an extreme curiosity to see this bright
      cousin who was an art-student.
    
    
      "He is gone to the banker's?" I asked.
    
    
      "Yes, to the banker's. He took me to a hotel, such a queer, quaint,
      delicious little place, with a court in the middle, and a gallery all
      round, and a lovely landlady, in such a beautifully fluted cap, and such a
      perfectly fitting dress! After a while we came out to walk to the
      banker's, for I haven't got any French money. But I was very dizzy from
      the motion of the vessel, and I thought I had better sit down. He found
      this place for me here, and he went off to the banker's himself. I am to
      wait here till he comes back."
    
    
      It may seem very fantastic, but it passed through my mind that he would
      never come back. I settled myself in my chair beside Miss Spencer and
      determined to await the event. She was extremely observant; there was
      something touching in it. She noticed everything that the movement of the
      street brought before us,&mdash;peculiarities of costume, the shapes of
      vehicles, the big Norman horses, the fat priests, the shaven poodles. We
      talked of these things, and there was something charming in her freshness
      of perception and the way her book-nourished fancy recognized and welcomed
      everything.
    
    
      "And when your cousin comes back, what are you going to do?" I asked.
    
    
      She hesitated a moment. "We don't quite know."
    
    
      "When do you go to Paris? If you go by the four o'clock train, I may have
      the pleasure of making the journey with you."
    
    
      "I don't think we shall do that. My cousin thinks I had better stay here a
      few days."
    
    
      "Oh!" said I; and for five minutes said nothing more. I was wondering what
      her cousin was, in vulgar parlance, "up to." I looked up and down the
      street, but saw nothing that looked like a bright American art-student. At
      last I took the liberty of observing that Havre was hardly a place to
      choose as one of the æsthetic stations of a European tour. It was a place
      of convenience, nothing more; a place of transit, through which transit
      should be rapid. I recommended her to go to Paris by the afternoon train,
      and meanwhile to amuse herself by driving to the ancient fortress at the
      mouth of the harbor,&mdash;that picturesque circular structure which bore
      the name of Francis the First, and looked like a small castle of St.
      Angelo. (It has lately been demolished.)
    
    
      She listened with much interest; then for a moment she looked grave.
    
    
      "My cousin told me that when he returned he should have something
      particular to say to me, and that we could do nothing or decide nothing
      until I should have heard it. But I will make him tell me quickly, and
      then we will go to the ancient fortress. There is no hurry to get to
      Paris; there is plenty of time."
    
    
      She smiled with her softly severe little lips as she spoke those last
      words. But I, looking at her with a purpose, saw just a tiny gleam of
      apprehension in her eye.
    
    
      "Don't tell me," I said, "that this wretched man is going to give you bad
      news!"
    
    
      "I suspect it is a little bad, but I don't believe it is very bad. At any
      rate, I must listen to it."
    
    
      I looked at her again an instant. "You did n't come to Europe to listen,"
      I said. "You came to see!" But now I was sure her cousin would come back;
      since he had something disagreeable to say to her, he certainly would turn
      up. We sat a while longer, and I asked her about her plans of travel She
      had them on her fingers' ends, and she told over the names with a kind of
      solemn distinctness: from Paris to Dijon and to Avignon, from Avignon to
      Marseilles and the Cornice road; thence to Genoa, to Spezia, to Pisa, to
      Florence, to Home. It apparently had never occurred to her that there
      could be the least incommodity in her travelling alone; and since she was
      unprovided with a companion I of course scrupulously abstained from
      disturbing her sense of security. At last her cousin came back. I saw him
      turn towards us out of a side street, and from the moment my eyes rested
      upon him I felt that this was the bright American art-student. He wore a
      slouch hat and a rusty black velvet jacket, such as I had often
      encountered in the Rue Bonaparte. His shirt-collar revealed the elongation
      of a throat which, at a distance, was not strikingly statuesque. He was
      tall and lean; he had red hair and freckles. So much I had time to observe
      while he approached the café, staring at me with natural surprise
      from under his umbrageous coiffure. When he came up to us I immediately
      introduced myself to him as an old acquaintance of Miss Spencer. He looked
      at me hard with a pair of little red eyes, then he made me a solemn bow in
      the French fashion, with his sombrero.
    
    
      "You were not on the ship?" he said.
    
    
      "No, I was not on the ship. I have been in Europe these three years."
    
    
      He bowed once more, solemnly, and motioned me to be seated again. I sat
      down, but it was only for the purpose of observing him an instant; I saw
      it was time I should return to my sister. Miss Spencer's cousin was a
      queer fellow. Nature had not shaped him for a Raphaelesque or Byronic
      attire, and his velvet doublet and naked neck were not in harmony with his
      facial attributes. His hair was cropped close to his head; his ears were
      large and ill-adjusted to the same. He had a lackadaisical carriage and a
      sentimental droop which were peculiarly at variance with his keen,
      strange-colored eyes. Perhaps I was prejudiced, but I thought his eyes
      treacherous. He said nothing for some time; he leaned his hands on his
      cane and looked up and down the street Then at last, slowly lifting his
      cane and pointing with it, "That's a very nice bit," he remarked, softly.
      He had his head on one side, and his little eyes were half closed. I
      followed the direction of his stick; the object it indicated was a red
      cloth hung out of an old window. "Nice bit of color," he continued; and
      without moving his head he transferred his half-closed gaze to me.
      "Composes well," he pursued. "Make a nice thing." He spoke in a hard
      vulgar voice.
    
    
      "I see you have a great deal of eye," I replied. "Your cousin tells me you
      are studying art." He looked at me in the same way without answering, and
      I went on with deliberate urbanity, "I suppose you are at the studio of
      one of those great men."
    
    
      Still he looked at me, and then he said softly, "Gérôme."
    
    
      "Do you like it?" I asked.
    
    
      "Do you understand French?" he said.
    
    
      "Some kinds," I answered.
    
    
      He kept his little eyes on me; then he said, "J'adore la peinture!"
    
    
      "Oh, I understand that kind!" I rejoined. Miss Spencer laid her hand upon
      her cousin's arm with a little pleased and fluttered movement; it was
      delightful to be among people who were on such easy terms with foreign
      tongues. I got up to take leave, and asked Miss Spencer where, in Paris, I
      might have the honor of waiting upon her. To what hotel would she go?
    
    
      She turned to her cousin inquiringly, and he honored me again with his
      little languid leer. "Do you know the Hôtel des Princes?"
    
    
      "I know where it is."
    
    
      "I shall take her there."
    
    
      "I congratulate you," I said to Caroline Spencer. "I believe it is the
      best inn in the world; and in case I should still have a moment to call
      upon you here, where are you lodged?"
    
    
      "Oh, it's such a pretty name," said Miss Spencer gleefully. "À la Belle
      Normande."
    
    
      As I left them her cousin gave me a great flourish with his picturesque
      hat.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      III.
    
    
      My sister, as it proved, was not sufficiently restored to leave Havre by
      the afternoon train; so that, as the autumn dusk began to fall, I found
      myself at liberty to call at the sign of the Fair Norman. I must confess
      that I had spent much of the interval in wondering what the disagreeable
      thing was that my charming friend's disagreeable cousin had been telling
      her. The "Belle Normande" was a modest inn in a shady bystreet, where it
      gave me satisfaction to think Miss Spencer must have encountered local
      color in abundance. There was a crooked little court, where much of the
      hospitality of the house was carried on; there was a staircase climbing to
      bedrooms on the outer side of the wall; there was a small trickling
      fountain with a stucco statuette in the midst of it; there was a little
      boy in a white cap and apron cleaning copper vessels at a conspicuous
      kitchen door; there was a chattering landlady, neatly laced, arranging
      apricots and grapes into an artistic pyramid upon a pink plate. I looked
      about, and on a green bench outside of an open door labelled Salle à
      Manger, I perceived Caroline Spencer. No sooner had I looked at her
      than I saw that something had happened since the morning. She was leaning
      back on her bench, her hands were clasped in her lap, and her eyes were
      fixed upon the landlady, at the other side of the court, manipulating her
      apricots.
    
    
      But I saw she was not thinking of apricots. She was staring absently,
      thoughtfully; as I came near her I perceived that she had been crying. I
      sat down on the bench beside her before she saw me; then, when she had
      done so, she simply turned round, without surprise, and rested her sad
      eyes upon me. Something very bad indeed had happened; she was completely
      changed.
    
    
      I immediately charged her with it. "Your cousin has been giving you bad
      news; you are in great distress."
    
    
      For a moment she said nothing, and I supposed that she was afraid to
      speak, lest her tears should come back. But presently I perceived that in
      the short time that had elapsed since my leaving her in the morning she
      had shed them all, and that she was now softly stoical, intensely
      composed.
    
    
      "My poor cousin is in distress," she said at last. "His news was bad."
      Then, after a brief hesitation, "He was in terrible want of money."
    
    
      "In want of yours, you mean?"
    
    
      "Of any that he could get&mdash;honestly. Mine was the only money."
    
    
      "And he has taken yours?"
    
    
      She hesitated again a moment, but her glance, meanwhile, was pleading. "I
      gave him what I had."
    
    
      I have always remembered the accent of those words as the most angelic bit
      of human utterance I had ever listened to; but then, almost with a sense
      of personal outrage, I jumped up. "Good heavens!" I said, "do you call
      that getting, it honestly?"
    
    
      I had gone too far; she blushed deeply. "We will not speak of it," she
      said.
    
    
      "We must speak of it," I answered, sitting down again. "I am your
      friend; it seems to me you need one. What is the matter with your cousin?"
    
    
      "He is in debt."
    
    
      "No doubt! But what is the special fitness of your paying his debts?"
    
    
      "He has told me all his story; I am very sorry for him."
    
    
      "So am I! But I hope he will give you back your money."
    
    
      "Certainly he will; as soon as he can."
    
    
      "When will that be?"
    
    
      "When he has finished his great picture."
    
    
      "My dear young lady, confound his great picture! Where is this desperate
      cousin?"
    
    
      She certainly hesitated now. Then,&mdash;"At his dinner," she answered.
    
    
      I turned about and looked through the open door into the salle à manger.
      There, alone at the end of a long table, I perceived the object of Miss
      Spencer's compassion, the bright young art-student. He was dining too
      attentively to notice me at first; but in the act of setting down a
      well-emptied wineglass he caught sight of my observant attitude. He paused
      in his repast, and, with his head on one side and his meagre jaws slowly
      moving, fixedly returned my gaze. Then the landlady came lightly brushing
      by with her pyramid of apricots.
    
    
      "And that nice little plate of fruit is for him?" I exclaimed.
    
    
      Miss Spencer glanced at it tenderly. "They do that so prettily!" she
      murmured.
    
    
      I felt helpless and irritated. "Come now, really," I said; "do you approve
      of that long strong fellow accepting your funds?" She looked away from me;
      I was evidently giving her pain. The case was hopeless; the long strong
      fellow had "interested" her.
    
    
      "Excuse me if I speak of him so unceremoniously," I said. "But you are
      really too generous, and he is not quite delicate enough. He made his
      debts himself; he ought to pay them himself."
    
    
      "He has been foolish," she answered; "I know that He has told me
      everything. We had a long talk this morning; the poor fellow threw himself
      upon my charity. He has signed notes to a large amount."
    
    
      "The more fool he!"
    
    
      "He is in extreme distress; and it is not only himself. It is his poor
      wife."
    
    
      "Ah, he has a poor wife?"
    
    
      "I didn't know it; but he confessed everything. He married two years
      since, secretly."
    
    
      "Why secretly?"
    
    
      Caroline Spencer glanced about her, as if she feared listeners. Then
      softly, in a little impressive tone,&mdash;"She was a countess!"
    
    
      "Are you very sure of that?"
    
    
      "She has written me a most beautiful letter."
    
    
      "Asking you for money, eh?"
    
    
      "Asking me for confidence and sympathy," said Miss Spencer. "She has been
      disinherited by her father. My cousin told me the story, and she tells it
      in her own way, in the letter. It is like an old romance. Her father
      opposed the marriage, and when he discovered that she had secretly
      disobeyed him he cruelly cast her off. It is really most romantic. They
      are the oldest family in Provence."
    
    
      I looked and listened in wonder. It really seemed that the poor woman was
      enjoying the "romance" of having a discarded countess-cousin, out of
      Provence, so deeply as almost to lose the sense of what the forfeiture of
      her money meant for her.
    
    
      "My dear young lady," I said, "you don't want to be ruined for
      picturesqueness' sake?"
    
    
      "I shall not be ruined. I shall come back before long to stay with them.
      The Countess insists upon that."
    
    
      "Come back! You are going home, then?"
    
    
      She sat for a moment with her eyes lowered, then with an heroic
      suppression of a faint tremor of the voice,&mdash;"I have no money for
      travelling!" she answered.
    
    
      "You gave it all up?"
    
    
      "I have kept enough to take me home."
    
    
      I gave an angry groan; and at this juncture Miss Spencer's cousin, the
      fortunate possessor of her sacred savings and of the hand of the Provençal
      countess, emerged from the little dining-room. He stood on the threshold
      for an instant, removing the stone from a plump apricot which he had
      brought away from the table; then he put the apricot into his mouth, and
      while he let it sojourn there, gratefully, stood looking at us, with his
      long legs apart and his hands dropped into the pockets of his velvet
      jacket. My companion got up, giving him a thin glance which I caught in
      its passage, and which expressed a strange commixture of resignation and
      fascination,&mdash;a sort of perverted exaltation. Ugly, vulgar,
      pretentious, dishonest, as I thought the creature, he had appealed
      successfully to her eager and tender imagination. I was deeply disgusted,
      but I had no warrant to interfere, and at any rate I felt that it would be
      vain.
    
    
      The young man waved his hand with a pictorial gesture. "Nice old court,"
      he observed. "Nice mellow old place. Good tone in that brick. Nice crooked
      old staircase."
    
    
      Decidedly, I could n't stand it; without responding I gave my hand to
      Caroline Spencer. She looked at me an instant with her little white face
      and expanded eyes, and as she showed her pretty teeth I suppose she meant
      to smile.
    
    
      "Don't be sorry for me," she said, "I am very sure I shall see something
      of this dear old Europe yet."
    
    
      I told her that I would not bid her goodby; I should find a moment to come
      back the next morning. Her cousin, who had put on his sombrero again,
      flourished it off at me by way of a bow, upon which I took my departure.
    
    
      The next morning I came back to the inn, where I met in the court the
      landlady, more loosely laced than in the evening. On my asking for Miss
      Spencer,&mdash;"Partie, monsieu," said the hostess. "She went away
      last night at ten o 'clock, with her&mdash;her&mdash;not her husband, eh?&mdash;in
      fine, her monsieur. They went down to the American ship." I turned
      away; the poor girl had been about thirteen hours in Europe.
    
    
      
       
    
    
      
    
    
      IV.
    
    
      I myself, more fortunate, was there some five years longer. During this
      period I lost my friend Latouche, who died of a malarious fever during a
      tour in the Levant. One of the first things I did on my return was to go
      up to Grimwinter to pay a consolatory visit to his poor mother. I found
      her in deep affliction, and I sat with her the whole of the morning that
      followed my arrival (I had come in late at night), listening to her
      tearful descant and singing the praises of my friend. We talked of nothing
      else, and our conversation terminated only with the arrival of a quick
      little woman who drove herself up to the door in a "carryall," and whom I
      saw toss the reins upon the horse's back with the briskness of a startled
      sleeper throwing back the bed-clothes. She jumped out of the carryall and
      she jumped into the room. She proved to be the minister's wife and the
      great town-gossip, and she had evidently, in the latter capacity, a choice
      morsel to communicate. I was as sure of this as I was that poor Mrs.
      Latouche was not absolutely too bereaved to listen to her. It seemed to me
      discreet to retire; I said I believed I would go and take a walk before
      dinner.
    
    
      "And, by the way," I added, "if you will tell me where my old friend Miss
      Spencer lives, I will walk to her house."
    
    
      The minister's wife immediately responded. Miss Spencer lived in the
      fourth house beyond the "Baptist church; the Baptist church was the one on
      the right, with that queer green thing over the door; they called it a
      portico, but it looked more like an old-fashioned bedstead.
    
    
      "Yes, do go and see poor Caroline," said Mrs. Latouche. "It will refresh
      her to see a strange face."
    
    
      "I should think she had had enough of strange faces!" cried the minister's
      wife.
    
    
      "I mean, to see a visitor," said Mrs. Latouche, amending her phrase.
    
    
      "I should think she had had enough of visitors!" her companion rejoined.
      "But you don't mean to stay ten years," she added, glancing at me.
    
    
      "Has she a visitor of that sort?" I inquired, perplexed.
    
    
      "You will see the sort!" said the minister's wife. "She's easily seen; she
      generally sits in the front yard. Only take care what you say to her, and
      be very sure you are polite."
    
    
      "Ah, she is so sensitive?"
    
    
      The minister's wife jumped up and dropped me a curtsey, a most ironical
      curtsey.
    
    
      "That's what she is, if you please. She's a countess!"
    
    
      And pronouncing this word with the most scathing accent, the little woman
      seemed fairly to laugh in the Countess's face. I stood a moment, staring,
      wondering, remembering.
    
    
      "Oh, I shall be very polite!" I cried; and grasping my hat and stick, I
      went on my way.
    
    
      I found Miss Spencer's residence without difficulty. The Baptist church
      was easily identified, and the small dwelling near it, of a rusty white,
      with a large central chimney-stack and a Virginia creeper, seemed
      naturally and properly the abode of a frugal old maid with a taste for the
      picturesque. As I approached I slackened my pace, for I had heard that
      some one was always sitting in the front yard, and I wished to
      reconnoitre. I looked cautiously over the low white fence which separated
      the small garden-space from the unpaved street; but I descried nothing in
      the shape of a countess. A small straight path led up to the crooked
      doorstep, and on either side of it was a little grass-plot, fringed with
      currant-bushes. In the middle of the grass, on either side, was a large
      quince-tree, full of antiquity and contortions, and beneath one of the
      quince-trees were placed a small table and a couple of chairs. On the
      table lay a piece of unfinished embroidery and two or three books in
      bright-colored paper covers. I went in at the gate and paused halfway
      along the path, scanning the place for some farther token of its occupant,
      before whom&mdash;I could hardly have said why&mdash;I hesitated abruptly
      to present myself. Then I saw that the poor little house was very shabby.
      I felt a sudden doubt of my right to intrude; for curiosity had been my
      motive, and curiosity here seemed singularly indelicate. While I
      hesitated, a figure appeared in the open doorway and stood there looking
      at me. I immediately recognized Caroline Spencer, but she looked at me as
      if she had never seen me before. Gently, but gravely and timidly, I
      advanced to the doorstep, and then I said, with an attempt at friendly
      badinage,&mdash;
    
    
      "I waited for you over there to come back, but you never came."
    
    
      "Waited where, sir?" she asked softly, and her light-colored eyes expanded
      more than before.
    
    
      She was much older; she looked tired and wasted.
    
    
      "Well," I said, "I waited at Havre."
    
    
      She stared; then she recognized me. She smiled and blushed and clasped her
      two hands together. "I remember you now," she said. "I remember that day."
      But she stood there, neither coming out nor asking me to come in. She was
      embarrassed.
    
    
      I, too, felt a little awkward. I poked my stick into the path. "I kept
      looking out for you, year after year," I said.
    
    
      "You mean in Europe?" murmured Miss Spencer.
    
    
      "In Europe, of course! Here, apparently, you are easy enough to find."
    
    
      She leaned her hand against the unpainted doorpost, and her head fell a
      little to one side. She looked at me for a moment without speaking, and I
      thought I recognized the expression that one sees in women's eyes when
      tears are rising. Suddenly she stepped out upon the cracked slab of stone
      before the threshold and closed the door behind her. Then she began to
      smile intently, and I saw that her teeth were as pretty as ever. But there
      had been tears too.
    
    
      "Have you been there ever since?" she asked, almost in a whisper.
    
    
      "Until three weeks ago. And you&mdash;you never came back?"
    
    
      Still looking at me with her fixed smile, she put her hand behind her and
      opened the door again. "I am not very polite," she said. "Won't you come
      in?"
    
    
      "I am afraid I incommode you."
    
    
      "Oh, no!" she answered, smiling more than ever. And she pushed back the
      door, with a sign that I should enter.
    
    
      I went in, following her. She led the way to a small room on the left of
      the narrow hall, which I supposed to be her parlor, though it was at the
      back of the house, and we passed the closed door of another apartment
      which apparently enjoyed a view of the quince-trees. This one looked out
      upon a small woodshed and two clucking hens. But I thought it very pretty,
      until I saw that its elegance was of the most frugal kind; after which,
      presently, I thought it prettier still, for I had never seen faded chintz
      and old mezzotint engravings, framed in varnished autumn leaves, disposed
      in so graceful a fashion. Miss Spencer sat down on a very small portion of
      the sofa, with her hands tightly clasped in her lap. She looked ten years
      older, and it would have souuded very perverse now to speak of her as
      pretty. But I thought her so; or at least I thought her touching. She was
      peculiarly agitated. I tried to appear not to notice it; but suddenly, in
      the most inconsequent fashion,&mdash;it was an irresistible memory of our
      little friendship at Havre,&mdash;I said to her, "I do incommode you. You
      are distressed."
    
    
      She raised her two hands to her face, and for a moment kept it buried in
      them. Then, taking them away,&mdash;"It's because you remind me&mdash;"
      she said.
    
    
      "I remind you, you mean, of that miserable day at Havre?"
    
    
      She shook her head. "It was not miserable. It was delightful."
    
    
      "I never was so shocked as when, on going back to your inn the next
      morning, I found you had set sail again."
    
    
      She was silent a moment; and then she said, "Please let us not speak of
      that."
    
    
      "Did you come straight back here?" I asked.
    
    
      "I was back here just thirty days after I had gone away."
    
    
      "And here you have remained ever since?"
    
    
      "Oh, yes!" she said gently.
    
    
      "When are you going to Europe again?"
    
    
      This question seemed brutal; but there was something that irritated me in
      the softness of her resignation, and I wished to extort from her some
      expression of impatience.
    
    
      She fixed her eyes for a moment upon a small sunspot on the carpet; then
      she got up and lowered the window-blind a little, to obliterate it.
      Presently, in the same mild voice, answering my question, she said,
      "Never!"
    
    
      "I hope your cousin repaid you your money."
    
    
      "I don't care for it now," she said, looking away from me.
    
    
      "You don't care for your money?"
    
    
      "For going to Europe."
    
    
      "Do you mean that you would not go if you could?"
    
    
      "I can't&mdash;I can't," said Caroline Spencer. "It is all over; I never
      think of it."
    
    
      "He never repaid you, then!" I exclaimed.
    
    
      "Please&mdash;please," she began.
    
    
      But she stopped; she was looking toward the door. There had been a
      rustling aud a sound of steps in the hall.
    
    
      I also looked toward the door, which was open, and now admitted another
      person, a lady, who paused just within the threshold. Behind her came a
      young man. The lady looked at me with a good deal of fixedness, long
      enough for my glance to receive a vivid impression of herself. Then she
      turned to Caroline Spencer, and, with a smile and a strong foreign accent,&mdash;
    
    
      "Excuse my interruption!" she said. "I knew not you had company, the
      gentleman came in so quietly."
    
    
      With this she directed her eyes toward me again.
    
    
      She was very strange; yet my first feeling was that I had seen her before.
      Then I perceived that I had only seen ladies who were very much like her.
      But I had seen them very far away from Grimwinter, and it was an odd
      sensation to be seeing her here. Whither was it the sight of her seemed to
      transport me? To some dusky landing before a shabby Parisian quatrième,&mdash;to
      an open door revealing a greasy antechamber, and to Madame leaning over
      the banisters, while she holds a faded dressing-gown together and bawls
      down to the portress to bring up her coffee. Miss Spencer's visitor was a
      very large woman, of middle age, with a plump, dead-white face, and hair
      drawn back a la chinoise. She had a small penetrating eye, and what
      is called in French an agreeable smile. She wore an old pink cashmere
      dressing-gown, covered with white embroideries, and, like the figure in my
      momentary vision, she was holding it together in front with a bare and
      rounded arm and a plump and deeply dimpled hand.
    
    
      "It is only to spick about my café," she said to Miss Spencer, with
      her agreeable smile. "I should like it served in the garden under the
      leetle tree."
    
    
      The young man behind her had now stepped into the room, and he also stood
      looking at me. He was a pretty-faced little fellow, with an air of
      provincial foppishness,&mdash;a tiny Adonis of Grimwinter. He had a small
      pointed nose, a small pointed chin, and, as I observed, the most
      diminutive feet. He looked at me foolishly, with his mouth open.
    
    
      "You shall have your coffee," said Miss Spencer, who had a faint red spot
      in each of her cheeks.
    
    
      "It is well!" said the lady in the dressing-gown. "Find your bouk," she
      added, turning to the young man.
    
    
      He gazed vaguely round the room. "My grammar, d 'ye mean?" he asked, with
      a helpless intonation.
    
    
      But the large lady was inspecting me, curiously, and gathering in her
      dressing-gown with her white arm.
    
    
      "Find your bouk, my friend," she repeated.
    
    
      "My poetry, d 'ye mean?" said the young man, also staring at me again.
    
    
      "Never mind your bouk," said his companion. "To-day we will talk. We will
      make some conversation. But we must not interrupt. Come;" and she turned
      away. "Under the leetle tree," she added, for the benefit of Miss Spencer.
    
    
      Then she gave me a sort of salutation, and a "Monsieur!" with which she
      swept away again, followed by the young man.
    
    
      Caroline Spencer stood there with her eyes fixed upon the ground.
    
    
      "Who is that?" I asked.
    
    
      "The Countess, my cousin."
    
    
      "And who is the young man?"
    
    
      "Her pupil, Mr. Mixter."
    
    
      This description of the relation between the two persons who had just left
      the room made me break into a little laugh. Miss Spencer looked at me
      gravely.
    
    
      "She gives French lessons; she has lost her fortune."
    
    
      "I see," I said. "She is determined to be a burden to no one. That is very
      proper."
    
    
      Miss Spencer looked down on the ground again, "I must go and get the
      coffee," she said.
    
    
      "Has the lady many pupils?" I asked.
    
    
      "She has only Mr. Mixter. She gives all her time to him."
    
    
      At this I could not laugh, though I smelt provocation; Miss Spencer was
      too grave. "He pays very well," she presently added, with simplicity. "He
      is very rich. He is very kind. He takes the Countess to drive." And she
      was turning away.
    
    
      "You are going for the Countess's coffee?" I said.
    
    
      "If you will excuse me a few moments."
    
    
      "Is there no one else to do it?"
    
    
      She looked at me with the softest serenity. "I keep no servants."
    
    
      "Can she not wait upon herself?"
    
    
      "She is not used to that."
    
    
      "I see," said I, as gently as possible. "But before you go, tell me this:
      who is this lady?"
    
    
      "I told you about her before&mdash;that day. She is the wife of my cousin,
      whom you saw."
    
    
      "The lady who was disowned by her family in consequence of her marriage?"
    
    
      "Yes; they have never seen her again. They have cast her off."
    
    
      "And where is her husband?"
    
    
      "He is dead."
    
    
      "And where is your money?"
    
    
      The poor girl flinched; there was something too consistent in my
      questions. "I don't know," she said wearily.
    
    
      But I continued a moment. "On her husband's death this lady came over
      here?"
    
    
      "Yes, she arrived one day."
    
    
      "How long ago?"
    
    
      "Two years."
    
    
      "She has been here ever since?"
    
    
      "Every moment."
    
    
      "How does she like it?"
    
    
      "Not at all."
    
    
      "And how do you like it?"
    
    
      Miss Spencer laid her face in her two hands an instant, as she had done
      ten minutes before.
    
    
      Then, quickly, she went to get the Countess's coffee.
    
    
      I remained alone in the little parlor; I wanted to see more, to learn
      more. At the end of five minutes the young man whom Miss Spencer had
      described as the Countess's pupil came in. He stood looking at me for a
      moment with parted lips. I saw he was a very rudimentary young man.
    
    
      "She wants to know if you won't come out there," he observed at last.
    
    
      "Who wants to know?"
    
    
      "The Countess. That French lady."
    
    
      "She has asked you to bring me?"
    
    
      "Yes, sir," said the young man feebly, looking at my six feet of stature.
    
    
      I went out with him, and we found the Countess sitting under one of the
      little quince-trees in front of the house. She was drawing a needle
      through the piece of embroidery which she had taken from the small table.
      She pointed graciously to the chair beside her, and I seated myself. Mr.
      Mixter glanced about him, and then sat down in the grass at her feet. He
      gazed upward, looking with parted lips from the Countess to me. "I am sure
      you speak French," said the Countess, fixing her brilliant little eyes
      upon me.
    
    
      "I do, madam, after a fashion," I answered in the lady's own tongue.
    
    
      "Voilà!" she cried most expressively. "I knew it so soon as I
      looked at you. You have been in my poor dear country."
    
    
      "A long time."
    
    
      "You know Paris?"
    
    
      "Thoroughly, madam." And with a certain conscious purpose I let my eyes
      meet her own.
    
    
      She presently, hereupon, moved her own and glanced down at Mr. Mixter
      "What are we talking about?" she demanded of her attentive pupil.
    
    
      He pulled his knees up, plucked at the grass with his hand, stared,
      blushed a little. "You are talking French," said Mr. Mixter.
    
    
      "La belle découverte!" said the Countess. "Here are ten months,"
      she explained to me, "that I am giving him lessons. Don't put yourself out
      not to say he's an idiot; he won't understand you."
    
    
      "I hope your other pupils are more gratifying," I remarked.
    
    
      "I have no others. They don't know what French is in this place; they
      don't want to know. You may therefore imagine the pleasure it is to me to
      meet a person who speaks it like yourself." I replied that my own pleasure
      was not less; and she went on drawing her stitches through her embroidery,
      with her little finger curled out. Every few moments she put her eyes
      close to her work, nearsightedly. I thought her a very disagreeable
      person; she was coarse, affected, dishonest, and no more a countess than I
      was a caliph. "Talk to me of Paris," she went on. "The very name of it
      gives me an emotion! How long since you were there?"
    
    
      "Two months ago."
    
    
      "Happy man! Tell me something about it What were they doing? Oh, for an
      hour of the boulevard!"
    
    
      "They were doing about what they are always doing,&mdash;amusing
      themselves a good deal."
    
    
      "At the theatres, eh?" sighed the Countess. "At the cafés-concerts,
      at the little tables in front of the doors? Quelle existence! You
      know I am a Parisienne, monsieur," she added, "to my fingertips."
    
    
      "Miss Spencer was mistaken, then," I ventured to rejoin, "in telling me
      that you are a Provençale."
    
    
      She stared a moment, then she put her nose to her embroidery, which had a
      dingy, desultory aspect. "Ah, I am a Provençale by birth; but I am a
      Parisienne by&mdash;inclination."
    
    
      "And by experience, I suppose?" I said.
    
    
      She questioned me a moment with her hard little eyes. "Oh, experience! I
      could talk of experience if I wished. I never expected, for example, that
      experience had this in store for me." And she pointed with her bare
      elbow, and with a jerk of her head, at everything that surrounded her,&mdash;at
      the little white house, the quince-tree, the rickety paling, even at Mr.
      Mixter.
    
    
      "You are in exile!" I said, smiling.
    
    
      "You may imagine what it is! These two years that I have been here I have
      passed hours&mdash;hours! One gets used to things, and sometimes I think I
      have got used to this. But there are some things that are always beginning
      over again. For example, my coffee."
    
    
      "Do you always have coffee at this hour?" I inquired.
    
    
      She tossed back her head and measured me.
    
    
      "At what hour would you prefer me to have it? I must have my little cup
      after breakfast."
    
    
      "Ah, you breakfast at this hour?"
    
    
      "At midday&mdash;comme cela se fait. Here they breakfast at a
      quarter past seven! That 'quarter past' is charming!"
    
    
      "But you were telling me about your coffee? I observed
      sympathetically.
    
    
      "My cousine can't believe in it; she can't understand it. She's an
      excellent girl; but that little cup of black coffee, with a drop of
      cognac, served at this hour,&mdash;they exceed her comprehension. So I
      have to break the ice every day, and it takes the coffee the time you see
      to arrive. And when it arrives, monsieur! If I don't offer you any of it
      you must not take it ill. It will be because I know you have drunk it on
      the boulevard."
    
    
      I resented extremely this scornful treatment of poor Caroline Spencer's
      humble hospitality; but I said nothing, in order to say nothing uncivil. I
      only looked on Mr. Mixter, who had clasped his arms round his knees and
      was watching my companion's demonstrative graces in solemn fascination.
      She presently saw that I was observing him; she glanced at me with a
      little bold explanatory smile. "You know, he adores me," she murmured,
      putting her nose into her tapestry again. I expressed the promptest
      credence, and she went on. "He dreams of becoming my lover! Yes, it's his
      dream. He has read a French novel; it took him six months. But ever since
      that he has thought himself the hero, and me the heroine!"
    
    
      Mr. Mixter had evidently not an idea that he was being talked about; he
      was too preoccupied with the ecstasy of contemplation. At this moment
      Caroline Spencer came out of the house, bearing a coffee-pot on a little
      tray. I noticed that on her way from the door to the table she gave me a
      single quick, vaguely appealing glance. I wondered what it signified; I
      felt that it signified a sort of half-frightened longing to know what, as
      a man of the world who had been in France, I thought of the Countess. It
      made me extremely uncomfortable. I could not tell her that the Countess
      was very possibly the runaway wife of a little hair-dresser. I tried
      suddenly, on the contrary, to show a high consideration for her. But I got
      up; I could n't stay longer. It vexed me to see Caroline Spencer standing
      there like a waiting-maid.
    
    
      "You expect to remain some time at Grimwinter?" I said to the Countess.
    
    
      She gave a terrible shrug.
    
    
      "Who knows? Perhaps for years. When one is in misery!&mdash;Chere belle"
      she added, turning to Miss Spencer, "you have forgotten the cognac!"
    
    
      I detained Caroline Spencer as, after looking a moment in silence at the
      little table, she was turning away to procure this missing delicacy. I
      silently gave her my hand in farewell. She looked very tired, but there
      was a strange hint of prospective patience in her severely mild little
      face. I thought she was rather glad I was going. Mr. Mixter had risen to
      his feet and was pouring out the Countess's coffee. As I went back past
      the Baptist church I reflected that poor Miss Spencer had been right in
      her presentiment that she should still see something of that dear old
      Europe.

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
