1</span>THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, FROM THE STRANGERS&rsquo;
GALLERY.</h2>
<p>Not far from Westminster Abbey, as most of our readers know
well, stands the gorgeous pile which Mr. Barry has designed, and
for which, in a pecuniary sense, a patient public has been rather
handsomely bled.&nbsp; Few are there who have looked at that pile
from the Bridge&mdash;or from the numerous steamers which throng
the river&mdash;or loitered round it on a summer&rsquo;s eve,
without feeling some little reverence for the spot haunted by
noble memories and heroic shades&mdash;where to this day
congregate the talent, the wealth, the learning, the wisdom of
the land.&nbsp; It is true, there are men&mdash;and that amiable
cynic, Mr. <!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>Henry Drummond, is one of
them&mdash;who maintain that the House of Commons is utterly
corrupt&mdash;that there is not a man in that House but has his
price; but we instinctively feel that such a general charge is
false&mdash;that no institution could exist steeped in the
demoralisation Mr. Drummond supposes&mdash;that his statement is
rather one of those ingenious paradoxes in which eccentric men
delight, than a sober exposition of the real truth.&nbsp; Mr.
Drummond should know better.&nbsp; A poor penny-a-liner of a
bilious temperament, without a rap in his pocket, might be
excused such cynicism; but it does not become an elderly
religious gentleman, well shaven&mdash;with clean linen, and a
good estate.&nbsp; The House of Commons is a mixed
assembly.&nbsp; It contains the fool of quality&mdash;the Beotian
squire&mdash;the needy adventurer&mdash;the unprincipled
charlatan; but these men do not rule it&mdash;do not form its
opinion&mdash;do not have much influence in it.&nbsp; It is an
assembly right in the main.&nbsp; Practically it consists of
well-endowed, well-informed business men&mdash;men with little
enthusiasm, but with plenty of common sense, and with more than
average intellect, integrity, and wealth.&nbsp; Still more may be
said.&nbsp; All that <!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>is great in our land is there.&nbsp;
It boasts the brightest names in literature, in eloquence, and in
law.&nbsp; Our island-mother has no more distinguished sons than
those whose names we see figuring day by day in the division
lists.&nbsp; Nowhere can a man see an assembly more honourable,
more to be held in honour, for all that men do honour, than the
British House of Commons, to which we now propose to introduce
the reader.</p>
<p>We suppose it to be the night of an important debate, and that
we have an order for the Strangers&rsquo; Gallery.&nbsp; As the
gallery will not hold more than seventy, and as each member may
give an order, it is very clear that at four, when it will be
thrown open, there will be more waiting for admission than the
place can possibly contain, and that our only chance of getting
in will be by being there as early as possible.&nbsp; When Mr.
Gladstone brought forward the Budget, for instance, there were
strangers waiting for admission as early as ten in the
morning.&nbsp; We go down about one, and are immediately directed
to a low, dark cellar, with but little light, save what comes
from a fire, that makes the place anything but refreshingly cool
or pleasant.&nbsp; Being <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>of a stoical turn, we bear our lot in
patience, not, however, without thinking that the Commons might
behave more respectfully to the sovereign people, than by
consigning them to this horrid blackhole.&nbsp; It is in vain we
try to read&mdash;it is too dark for that; or to talk&mdash;the
atmosphere is too oppressive even for that slight exertion; and
so we wile away the time in a gentle reverie.&nbsp; As soon as
this room is full, the rest of the strangers are put into the
custody of the police in St. Stephen&rsquo;s hall.&nbsp; That is
a far pleasanter place to wait in, for there is a continual
passing to and fro of lords and lawyers, and M.P.&rsquo;s and
parliamentary agents; so that if you do not get into the House,
you still see something going on; while in the cellar, you sit,
as Wordsworth says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Like a party in a parlour,<br />
All silent and all damned.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At length a bell rings.&nbsp; It is a welcome sound, for it
announces that the Speaker is going to prayers.&nbsp; A few
minutes, and another ringing makes us aware of the pleasing fact
that that gentleman&rsquo;s devotions have already
commenced.&nbsp; We joy to hear it, for we wish that the
policeman who has had us in charge, and who has ranged us in the
order of our respective <i>d&eacute;b&ucirc;ts</i>, will
presently <!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>command the first five to get out
their orders and proceed.&nbsp; The happy moment at last arrives,
and with a light heart we run up several flights of stairs, and
find ourselves in <span class="smcap">The House</span>.</p>
<p>But let us suppose we are fortunate enough to get a
Speaker&rsquo;s order, which admits us to a gallery before the
other, and with well stuffed leather cushions.&nbsp; It is hard
work sitting all night on bare boards, as one does in the
Strangers&rsquo; Gallery.&nbsp; We get into the lobby just as the
members are going in.&nbsp; What is that the officials are
calling out?&nbsp; &ldquo;Make way for the Speaker.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Of course we will; and as we do so, immediately sweeps by us a
gentleman in full-dress, with black breeches, silk stockings,
shoes and buckles, and a light Court sword.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is that
the Speaker?&rdquo; one asks.&nbsp; Oh, no; he is merely
Serjeant-at-Arms&mdash;he is the man who bears the mace, and sits
in a chair of state below the bar, and is terrible in the eyes of
refractory, chiefly Irish, M.P.&rsquo;s, and for all which
duties, though he is of the noble family of the House of Bedford,
and is brother to Lord John Russell, he condescends to receive
&pound;1,200 a year.&nbsp; Well, next to the Serjeant-at-Arms
comes the Speaker&mdash;the man whose eye aspiring orators find
it so difficult to <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>catch.&nbsp; Mr. Speaker has a
judicious eye, and is wary as a belle of the season of her
glances.&nbsp; Mr. Speaker is in full-dress; for he wears a
flowing gown and a full-bottomed wig, and in his hand he carries
a three-cocked hat; his train is borne by a train-bearer; behind
him comes the Chaplain, and in this order they advance to the
bar, and then to the table, where the Chaplain reads prayers
prior to the formation of a House.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile we present ourselves to the doorkeeper of the
Speaker&rsquo;s Gallery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name, sir?&rdquo; demands that acute official.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bricks, sir?&nbsp; I see no such name here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you must be mistaken&mdash;look again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, indeed there is no such name.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t allow you to pass up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! not Nicks?&rdquo; we repeat, indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicks, did you say, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I have that name; but you said
Bricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I did not,&rdquo; growl we.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I suppose it is all right; but if Mr. Nicks
comes, you must come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; we reply, ironically, as we push
the curtain on one side, and up we go.</p>
<p>At first we hardly know what we see.&nbsp; Chaos seems come
again.&nbsp; On the opposition benches Lord Stanley is seated; on
the ministerial the genteel Sir John Shelley is visible at one
end, and the stout W. J. Fox at the other.&nbsp; All is confusion
and disorder.&nbsp; No one but the Speaker seems to know what he
is about.&nbsp; It is the hour devoted to private business, and
Mr. Forster is bringing up bills like a retriever.&nbsp; He hands
his bills to the clerks, while the Speaker, to an inattentive
house, runs over their titles, and declares that they are read a
first, or second, or third time, as the case may be.&nbsp; Then
we hear him announce the name of some honourable M.P., who
immediately rises and reads a statement of the petition he holds
in his hand, with which he immediately rushes down and delivers
it to one of the clerks, and which thereupon the Speaker declares
is ordered to lie upon the table&mdash;but literally the petition
is popped into a bag.&nbsp; In the meanwhile let us look
around.&nbsp; Just below us is a small gallery for peers and
ambassadors, and other distinguished personages.&nbsp; On either
side of the house are galleries, very <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>pleasant to
sit, or lie, or occasionally sleep in, and by-and-bye we shall
see in them old fogies very red in the face, talking over the
last bit of scandal, and young moustached lords or officers,
sleeping away the time, to be ready, when the House breaks up,
for</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Fresh fields and pastures new.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Opposite to us is the Reporters&rsquo; Gallery.&nbsp; In the
early days of parliament reporting was a thing much
condemned.&nbsp; Sir Simonds d&rsquo;Ewes, under the date March
5, 1641&ndash;2, gives us a special instance of this.&nbsp; Sir
Edward Alford, member for Arundel, had been observed taking notes
of a proposed declaration moved by Pym.&nbsp; Sir Walter Earle,
member for Weymouth, upon this objected that he had seen
&ldquo;some at the lower end comparing their notes, and one of
them had gone out.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alford having been called back,
and given up his notes to the Speaker, D&rsquo;Ewes then
continues:&mdash;&ldquo;Sir Henry Vane, senior, sitting at that
time next me, said he could remember when no man was allowed to
take notes, and wished it to be now forbidden.&rdquo;&nbsp; At
present the gentlemen of the Press are taking it easy, and
favouring each other with criticisms on the speakers by no means
flattering.&nbsp; In <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>a little while they will have to
suspend their criticism and work hard enough.&nbsp; Above them
are gilt wires, behind which we perceive the glare of silks and
satins, and faintly&mdash;for otherwise attention would be drawn
from the speakers below to the ladies above&mdash;but still
clearly enough to make us believe&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That we can almost think we gaze<br />
Through golden vistas into heaven,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we see outlines of female forms; and we wonder if the time
will ever arrive when Lucretia Mott&rsquo;s dream shall be
realised, and woman take her seat in the senate, side by side
with the tyrant man.&nbsp; Under the Reporters&rsquo; Gallery,
and immediately facing us, sits the Speaker, in his chair of
state.&nbsp; On his right are the Treasury Benches; on the left,
those where the Opposition are condemned to sit, and fume and
fret in vain.&nbsp; Between these benches is the table at which
the clerk sits, and on which petitions, when they are received,
are ordered to lie, and where are placed the green boxes, on
which orators are very fond of striking, in order to give to
their speeches particular force.&nbsp; At the end of this table
commences the gangway, which is supposed to be filled with
independent statesmen, and to whom, therefore, at <!-- page
10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>particular times, the most passionate appeals are
addressed.&nbsp; Lower down is the Bar of the House, where sits
the sergeant-at-arms on a chair of state, with a sword by his
side; but him we cannot see, as he is immediately under us.&nbsp;
At the end of the table lies the &ldquo;gilt bauble,&rdquo; as
Cromwell called the mace&mdash;which is the sign of the
Speaker&rsquo;s presence, and which is always put under the table
when the Speaker leaves the chair.&nbsp; At one time, when a
message from the Lords was announced, the Mace-bearer, bearing
the mace, went to the Bar of the House, and met the Messenger,
who came forward bowing, and retired in the same manner, with his
face to the Speaker; for it would have been a terrible breach of
etiquette had the Messenger favoured that illustrious personage
with a glimpse of his back.&nbsp; When the Speaker leaves the
chair, no one else occupies it.&nbsp; The House then goes into
committee, and a chairman is appointed, who sits by the clerks at
the table.&nbsp; On such occasions one of the forms of the House
pertinaciously adhered to is often productive of good
results.&nbsp; According to parliamentary rules, when the Speaker
puts the motion that &ldquo;I do now leave the chair,&rdquo;
previously to going into committee, it is at the <!-- page
11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>option of any member who has a question to ask, or a
statement to make, or a grievance to proclaim, to move that the
House do now adjourn, and then deliver himself of whatever he may
wish to say; or he can make his statement as an amendment.&nbsp;
Such forms are very valuable, though often very inconvenient to
ministers who are anxious to get over the business of the country
with as much expedition as possible, and give independent members
an opportunity of uttering their sentiments, of exposing jobs, of
being a terror to evil rulers, and a praise to them that do
well.&nbsp; They often lead to very animated discussions.&nbsp;
In such little skirmishes Lord Palmerston, the Bight Hon.
Benjamin Disraeli, and Mr. Thomas Duncombe greatly shine.&nbsp;
As a rule, you may in consequence hear better debates between
half-past five and eight&mdash;the time when these little scenes
may be expected&mdash;than at any other period of the evening,
unless, in the small hours, the House is precipitated into an
Irish row.</p>
<p>But time has passed away, and the more serious part of the
evening&rsquo;s business is commenced.&nbsp; The benches on both
sides of the House are already filled.&nbsp; That first row on
the Speaker&rsquo;s right contains the ministers.&nbsp; Fronting
<!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>them are the Opposition, always a formidable, and
generally a useful band.&nbsp; If the Conservatives are in
office, the Right Hon. Benjamin Disraeli occupies the middle of
the Treasury benches, supported on one side by the mild and
respectable Sir John Pakington, and on the other by a figure
fierce, and bearded, with a hook nose and a glittering eye like
that of the Ancient Mariner, the great poet, novelist, and
satirist of our day, Sir Bulwer Lytton.&nbsp; Lord Stanley, pale
and studious-looking, is by; and around them are the gentle
Walpole, the old party warrior, Fitzroy Kelly, and lesser
lights.&nbsp; But undoubtedly the observed of all observers is
the leader of the great Protectionist party, whose battles he has
fought, whose councils he has guided, whose chiefs he has placed
upon the Treasury bench.&nbsp; Up in the gallery no one is
watched more keenly.</p>
<p>Lord Palmerston is the next best-stared-at man in the House;
and next, that champion of the British constitution, Lord
John.&nbsp; The Palmerstonians, whether in office or languishing
on the bleak benches of opposition, are alike undistinguishable,
for they have an official knack of pulling the hat over the
eyebrow, so as completely to obscure the face, and from the
gallery you can scarce tell one <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>from the
other, with the exception of Sir G. W. Hayter, who has always a
mysterious air, and Wilson of the <i>Economist</i>, who rejoices
in carroty, and consequently unlovely locks.&nbsp; On the same
side of the House, but below the gangway, are the Irish ultras
and tenant leaguers, a band once formidable; but Lucas dead,
Duffy seeking on another arena the position denied him here,
Bowyer, bearded and red-haired, little better than the mouthpiece
of Ultramontanism&mdash;that small party are little feared and
little courted now.&nbsp; Below the gangway is the balance of
power, where sit, on the first bench on the floor, on the right,
Roebuck and Lord John Russell; the Manchester party (for, in
spite of Manchester&rsquo;s ignoble denial of the same, there is
still a policy known as of Manchester) are close behind.&nbsp;
The Peelites and the eccentricities sit on the other side.&nbsp;
Bright and Gibson represent the Gracchi.&nbsp; What Gladstone and
Sidney Herbert and Sir James Graham represent, it is hard to say;
yet in that great assembly you shall not find three abler
men.</p>
<p>But we have been already some time in the House.&nbsp; Hours
have come and gone&mdash;day has faded into night.&nbsp;
Suddenly, from the painted glass ceiling above, a mellow light
has streamed <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>down upon us all.&nbsp; Rich velvet
curtains have been drawn across the gorgeously painted windows,
and if we had only good speeches to listen to, we should be very
comfortable indeed.&nbsp; Alas, alas, there is no help for
us!&nbsp; As soon as &ldquo;Wishy&rdquo; sits down,
&ldquo;Washy&rdquo; gets up; and members thin off, leaving
scarcely forty in the House.&nbsp; Nor can we wonder at
this.&nbsp; Men must dine once in the twenty-four hours, and
members of the House of Commons obey this universal law.&nbsp;
Most of them have been hard at work all the day.&nbsp; It is no
very pleasant life theirs, after all; crowded committee rooms all
day, and the heated air of the House all night.&nbsp; An M.P.
should have an iron frame as Joseph Hume had, or he cannot do his
duty to his country or his constituents.&nbsp; Even we grow, as
we sit in the gallery a few hours, weary as Mariana in the moated
grange.&nbsp; Would that we were with the wife of our bosom at
home!&nbsp; Would that we were listening to the child-like
prattle and silver laugh of Rose!&nbsp; Would that we were
discussing divine philosophy with a friend amidst a genial cloud
of tobacco smoke!&nbsp; Would that we were
anywhere&mdash;anywhere out of this!&nbsp; Sleep comes not when
you want him.&nbsp; If you read, the gallery keeper is down on
you in an instant; and <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>as to talking, that is quite out of
the question.&nbsp; Hark! whose is that name the speaker
announces?&nbsp; It is that of one of the leaders.&nbsp; What a
change has come over the House!&nbsp; No more chatting and
laughing of members on empty benches&mdash;no more idling of
reporters&mdash;no more indifference in the strangers&rsquo;
gallery.&nbsp; Even the divine voices of the women are hushed,
and they stop to pay the homage beauty should ever love to pay to
intellect and strength.&nbsp; What a grand sound is that cheer
bursting from five hundred throats&mdash;for the house is hearty
in its approval of a good speech, on whatever side it be
delivered; and how telling is the reply, and how vehemently
cheered&mdash;on one side at least; and how chaotic the
confusion, and how discordant the sounds, when one of the smaller
fry attempts to continue the debate which the House evidently
considers has been sufficiently discussed, and respecting which
it is now anxious to come to a vote!&nbsp; The helpless
orator&rsquo;s voice is lost in the clamour.&nbsp; After a few
minutes&rsquo; purgatory he has sense enough to sit down, the
Speaker reads the question, and puts it&mdash;the ayes have it,
the noes demand a division&mdash;the bell rings&mdash;peers and
diplomatists and distinguished strangers under <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the gallery
are turned out.&nbsp; Thanks to our insignificance we are
suffered (though but recently has this been the case) to remain
and see the ayes move in to the right and noes to the left.&nbsp;
The House is emptied with the exception of the Speaker, the
clerks, and the tellers.&nbsp; Immediately it begins to
fill.&nbsp; After a little while all have come back.&nbsp; The
tellers go to the bar, and thence in a row march up to the table,
at which they are met by the clerk, to whom they give the result
of the division.&nbsp; Already the House knows which side has won
from the way in which the tellers are placed, the tellers of the
victorious party being on the right side.&nbsp; And now the
division is announced from the chair, the triumphant party cheer,
and the House, if it be late, almost immediately adjourns.&nbsp;
Out bound honourable M.P.&rsquo;s as schoolboys out of
school.&nbsp; Glad enough are they the thing is over; and,
lighting their cigars&mdash;it is astonishing what smokers
honourable gentlemen are&mdash;not unreluctantly do they go
home.&nbsp; Following their example, we exchange the noisy and
heated house for the chill and silent night.&nbsp; Yet, as we go,
we cannot help observing, how generally well-behaved and patient
the House has even been to unutterable bores.&nbsp; It is seldom
<!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>they put a man down, or are boisterous or rude.&nbsp; A
man of no party easily gets a hearing; but he cannot secure
attention.&nbsp; The House is polite, not cordial&mdash;civil,
but not encouraging.&nbsp; Accordingly the multitude, the second
and third-rate men&mdash;that is, all except a dozen&mdash;do not
attempt to speak to the House at all, but to the gallery, and,
through the press, to their constituents.&nbsp; If the speeches
were not reported, they would, in most cases, be made shorter and
better.&nbsp; For instance, your own representative Smithers made
a speech.&nbsp; The weak-minded politicians of Rottenborough
class Smithers as A 1; and when he tells them what a fire-eater
he is in the House, and what things he says to government, they
wonder Smithers has not been committed to the Tower for high
treason by the base and brutal myrmidons of power.&nbsp; Now,
what are the actual facts?&nbsp; While Smithers was speaking, the
House very still&mdash;and perhaps, with the exception of an
understrapper of the Treasury, enjoying a five minutes&rsquo;
snooze, or deep in a statistical calculation, not a soul was on
the government benches at all&mdash;nobody listened to Smithers;
yet, on went Smithers stuttering incoherently, reading from his
notes with fearful pauses between, screaming <!-- page 18--><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>at the top of
his voice, sawing the air with his arms in the manner of the
unhappy Mr. Frederick Peel, amidst universal indifference, save
when occasionally a good-natured friend timidly called out,
&ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Speaker, perhaps, was
chatting with an acquaintance about his next parliamentary
lev&eacute;e; if Smithers had stood on his head, I almost
question whether any one would have been aware of the fact; and
Smithers sits down, as he rises, without any particular mark of
approval at all.&nbsp; Why, then, does Smithers speak?&nbsp; Why,
because the Press is there&mdash;to treasure up every
word&mdash;to note down every sentence&mdash;to let the British
nation see what Smithers said.&nbsp; This, of course, is a great
temptation to Smithers to speak when there is no absolute
necessity that Smithers should open his mouth at all.&nbsp; Yet
this has its advantages&mdash;on the morrow honourable gentlemen
have the whole debate before them, coolly to peruse and study;
and if one grain of sense lurked in Smithers&rsquo; speech, the
country gets the benefit.&nbsp; At times, also, were it not for
the Press, it would be almost impossible to transact the business
of the country.&nbsp; For instance, we refer to Mr.
Wilson&rsquo;s proposals for Customs Reform.&nbsp; <!-- page
19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>On
the occasion to which we refer, Mr. Wilson spoke for nearly four
hours.&nbsp; Mr. Wilson we believe to be an excellent man, and
father of a family, but he certainly is a very poor
speaker.&nbsp; Never was there a duller and drearier
speech.&nbsp; Few men could sit it out.&nbsp; In the gallery
there were a few strong-minded females who heard every
word&mdash;what cannot a strong-minded woman do?&mdash;but
M.P.&rsquo;s gossipped in the lobby&mdash;or dined&mdash;or
smoked&mdash;or drank brandy-and-water&mdash;in short, did
anything but listen to Mr. Wilson; and yet this was a grave,
serious government measure.&nbsp; Why, then, did not members
listen?&nbsp; Because there was no need for them to do so.&nbsp;
The <i>Times</i> would give it them all the next morning; and so
it mattered little how empty of listeners was the House, provided
the reporters were there and did their duty.&nbsp; It is the same
when the House legislates for our Imperial colonies, or our
150,000,000 in India.&nbsp; It is to the Reporters&rsquo; Gallery
members speak, not to the House.&nbsp; Thus is it orators are so
plentiful in spite of the freezing atmosphere.&nbsp; Ordinarily
no one listens&mdash;no one expects to be convinced&mdash;no one
seeks to convince.&nbsp; Said an old M.P., &ldquo;I never knew a
speech that influenced a vote.&rdquo;&nbsp; As <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>a rule, the
M.P. was right.&nbsp; Orators like George Thompson are quite out
of place in it.&nbsp; Such a man as Henry Vincent would be a
laughingstock.&nbsp; The House consists of middle-aged gentlemen
of good parts and habits, and they like to do business and to be
spoken to in a business-like way.&nbsp; Next to business-like
speakers, the House likes joking.&nbsp; Hence it is Tom Duncombe
and Lord Palmerston are such favourites.&nbsp; Hence it is that
Colonel Sibthorp got and Henry Drummond gets so readily the ear
of the House.&nbsp; The House cares little for declamation.&nbsp;
It would rather be without it.&nbsp; It considers it a waste of
time.&nbsp; Figures of arithmetic are far more popular than
figures of speech.&nbsp; You must learn to speak to the House in
its own style.&nbsp; Disraeli attempted to take the House by
storm, and palpably failed.&nbsp; He altered his style.&nbsp; He
learnt to talk figures, and became a success.&nbsp; More recently
Mr. Warren attempted the same feat, and also failed.&nbsp; If you
adopt the Parliamentary style, and have the requisite
<i>physique</i>, whether you be Tory, Radical, Free-trader, or
Protectionist&mdash;Protestant or Roman Catholic&mdash;Irish,
Scotch, or English&mdash;whether you represent a borough or a
county&mdash;you have a chance of being heard.&nbsp; The <!--
page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>House of Commons, it is true, is a club, but it is not
an exclusive one.&nbsp; All classes are represented there.&nbsp;
The Roman Catholic wolf reposes in it meekly by the side of the
Protestant lamb.&nbsp; There you see, side by side, teetotal
Crossley and Bass famed for bitter beer.&nbsp; Oxford sends there
its trained and scholarly churchmanship, and the manufacturing
towns their vigorous dissent.&nbsp; Lowness of birth is no
obstacle to success.&nbsp; Lindsay was a cabin-boy; Fox, a weaver
in Norwich in his youth; poor Brotherton, a factory lad; Ingram
cleaned the shoes of one of his constituents; yet the House gives
these men as ready a hearing as it awards to the inheritors of
broad domains and the most illustrious of historic names.&nbsp;
If the House is flunkeyfied, conventional, and illogical, it is
the fault of the public&mdash;more flunkeyfied, conventional, and
illogical&mdash;whom it represents.&nbsp; Waste not your honest
indignation, but reserve it for the proper parties out of
doors.&nbsp; Nor grumble that the working men have had no
representative since their order was represented by the idiotic
and self-seeking Feargus O&rsquo;Connor, when you remember that,
by means of the freehold land societies, almost any working men
who like to go without beer might <!-- page 22--><a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>in a very
short time acquire votes, and, combined, might carry the
counties.&nbsp; Aristocrats, you say, are in the People&rsquo;s
House.&nbsp; Yes, but they are men, most of them, of untainted
honour&mdash;of lofty aim&mdash;of comprehensive views; and the
general fusion and ventilation of opinion and clash of intellect
elicit action most congenial with the intelligence of the
age.&nbsp; Take any of the extreme men, for instance.&nbsp; What
can they do?&nbsp; Are they the representatives of the mass of
opinion?&nbsp; Is the country prepared to break up the National
Church, as Mr. Miall would recommend&mdash;to dissolve the Union,
as Gavan Duffy desired&mdash;to put down all our armaments, as
Mr. Bright would think proper&mdash;to grant the five points of
the Charter, as poor Feargus O&rsquo;Connor contended?&nbsp; Most
certainly not.&nbsp; Yet the representatives of such opinions are
in the House, and rightly in the House.&nbsp; With them away, the
opinions of the people would not be fairly represented.&nbsp; At
the same time, it must be remembered, that such men represent but
sections, and it is wisely arranged that the representatives of
all sections shall meet.&nbsp; Thus justice is done to all.&nbsp;
Thus mutual toleration is learned.&nbsp; Thus the mental vision
of all becomes <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>enlarged.&nbsp; We make these remarks
because we think we see a tendency to run down the House of
Commons, and the representative institutions of which it is the
type.&nbsp; By Britons this feeling should not be
entertained.&nbsp; That assembly contains, it is true, not the
grandest, but the best practical intellects of which our country
can boast.&nbsp; In its earliest days it rocked the cradle of our
liberties, and still it guards them, though the stripling has
long become a giant.&nbsp; At our elections there is deep-seated
demoralisation, but still that demoralisation has its bounds
which it cannot pass, and the high-minded and the honourable form
the majority in the House of Commons.&nbsp; At any rate, the
representative body is quite as virtuous and intelligent as the
constituency.&nbsp; If, gentle reader, it laughs at your
favourite idea, it only does so because that idea is a poor
squalling brat, not a goddess with celestial mien and air.&nbsp;
A time may come when it may be that, and then it will not knock
at the door of the House in vain.&nbsp; Till then, the House may
be forgiven for not thinking of it.&nbsp; The House is not bound
to take notice of it till then.&nbsp; Law
Reform&mdash;Parliamentary Reform&mdash;Financial
Reform&mdash;Customs
Reform&mdash;Education&mdash;Colonies&mdash;<!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>Convicts&mdash;India&mdash;these are the topics with
which the House has now painfully to grapple.&nbsp; Your
favourite idea must wait a little longer.&nbsp; In the meantime,
if it be a good one let us wish it well&mdash;if it be a true
one, we shall surely hear of it again.</p>

25</span>A NIGHT WITH THE LORDS.</h2>
<p>Amongst the sights of London surely may be reckoned the
Chamber of Peers&mdash;fallen from its high estate, but still
existing as a potent institution in this self-governing country
and democratic age.&nbsp; Of course it is usual to sneer at the
peers&mdash;we all do so; and yet we would move heaven and earth
to be seen walking arm in arm with a peer, no matter how old or
vicious he be, on the sunny side of Pall Mall.&nbsp; We all say
the peers must give way to the Commons; and yet we all know that
half the latter are returned by the former, and that you can no
more succeed in contesting a county against its lords and
landlords, than you can hope to fly in the air, or to walk on the
sea.&nbsp; Hear a pot-house orator on the House of Peers, you
would think it the most indefensible establishment
imaginable.&nbsp; But is it so?&nbsp; Ask Exeter Hall; that truly
British institution is in raptures with the whole British
peerage.&nbsp; A lord at a Bible meeting&mdash;a lord <!-- page
26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>stammering a few unconnected common-places about the
propagation of Christianity in foreign parts, or the conversion
of the Jews&mdash;a lord denouncing the Pope, or anticipating the
coming of the millennium&mdash;is a sight dear to the British
public.&nbsp; Sneer at the Lords as you will, expatiate on the
manifest absurdity of supposing that they are wiser and better
than other people, say, what every one knows and thinks, that you
cannot transmit brains as you can the family spoons, and that
therefore the idea involved in hereditary peerage is a lie;
nevertheless, the House of Peers still continues a great
fact.&nbsp; And it is a gorgeous fact as well.&nbsp; The
apartments of the Commons are poor and mean compared with the
chamber, all resplendent with crimson and gold, where the Lords
meet.&nbsp; As you enter the central hall in the new Houses of
Parliament, the passage to the right leads you to the
Lords.&nbsp; We will suppose you have got an order&mdash;any peer
can give you one; and as the House commences its sitting at five,
and there is plenty of room in the gallery, you may take your
time almost as freely as the celebrated Miss Lucy Long
herself.&nbsp; Passing the lobby, you soon find your way into the
house, the magnificent adorning of which will be sure to <!--
page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>excite your utmost admiration.&nbsp; Some may say it is
too gaudy, everything pertaining to the chamber is so richly
decorated; but it is very fine, and when Parliament is opened by
Majesty in person, and the house is crowded with all the great
men of our land, and the galleries blaze with beauty and
diamonds, the effect must be, as it has always been described,
imposing in the extreme.&nbsp; On ordinary evenings, however,
nothing of this splendour is visible; the house has a deserted
air; an assembly of a dozen or twenty is a very fair muster; a
debate of a couple of hours is generally considered as unusually
exciting and fierce.&nbsp; The best description of a debate in
the Lords we have ever read is that by Disraeli, in the
&ldquo;Young Duke.&rdquo;&nbsp; We quote the
passage:&mdash;&ldquo;The Duke of St. James took the oaths and
his seat.&nbsp; He was introduced by Lord Pompey.&nbsp; He heard
a debate.&nbsp; We laugh at such a thing, especially in the Upper
House; but on the whole the affair is imposing, especially if we
take a part in it.&nbsp; Lord Exchamberlain thought the nation
going on wrong, and he made a speech full of currency and
constitution.&nbsp; Baron Deprivey Seal seconded him with great
effect&mdash;brief, but bitter, satirical, and sore.&nbsp; The
Earl of Quarterday <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>answered these, full of confidence in
the nation and in himself.&nbsp; When the debate was getting
heavy, Lord Snap jumped up to give them something light.&nbsp;
The Lords do not encourage wit, and so are obliged to put up with
pertness.&nbsp; But Viscount Memoir was very statesmanlike, and
spouted a sort of universal history.&nbsp; Then there was Lord
Ego, who vindicated his character when nobody knew he had one,
and explained his motives because his auditors could not
understand his acts.&nbsp; Then there was a maiden speech, so
inaudible that it was doubted after all whether the young orator
really did lose his virginity.&nbsp; In the end, up started the
Premier, who, having nothing to say, was manly, and candid, and
liberal; gave credit to his adversaries and took credit to
himself, and then the motion was withdrawn.&nbsp; While all this
was going on, some made a note, some made a bet, some consulted a
book, some their ease, some yawned, a few slept.&nbsp; Yet, on
the whole, there was an air about the assembly which can be
witnessed in no other in Europe.&nbsp; Even the most indifferent
looked as if he would come forward if the occasion should demand
him, and the most imbecile as if he could serve his country if it
required him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>But let us look around us.&nbsp; We, the strangers, are
up in a comfortable gallery at one end of a long, narrow, and
rather dark chamber, along the sides of which are narrow windows
of painted glass, and bronze statues of the barons of the olden
time.&nbsp; In a smaller gallery, just beneath us, sit the
parliamentary reporters.&nbsp; Exactly opposite us is the <span
class="smcap">Throne</span>; its splendour we but faintly
perceive, for it is veiled from vulgar eyes; but there it
is&mdash;the very spot where Majesty sits, while around her are
principalities and powers,&mdash;there the royal assent is given
to laws which affect the weal or woe of an empire&mdash;there,
with silvery voice, and faultless delivery, and perfect
pronunciation, are spoken royal speeches, greedily bought up in
second editions of the morning papers, and flashed along the
electric wires to all the great cities of our own and the
capitals of other lands.&nbsp; At present a few peers are leaning
against the rails and chatting&mdash;that is all.&nbsp; A little
below the throne is the purple velvet cushion&mdash;the object of
so many a struggle&mdash;of so many a year of unflinching
toil&mdash;of so many a defence of party spoken in another
place&mdash;of so many a clever piece of intrigue.&nbsp; We mean
the woolsack, on which sits the Lord Chancellor Chelmsford.&nbsp;
If the debate <!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>is continued till a late hour, and
the keeper of her Majesty&rsquo;s conscience retires to dine,
Lord Redesdale acts as chairman <i>pro tem</i>.&nbsp; His
lordship is eccentric in his dress&mdash;black trousers, white
cravat, buff waistcoat, blue coat and brass buttons, white
stockings and shoes, compose a <i>tout ensemble</i> rarely seen
in the House of Lords or elsewhere.&nbsp; Greater men than Lord
Chelmsford have sat on the woolsack.&nbsp; We live in a little
age.&nbsp; Our great men are little men after all.&nbsp; Our Lord
Chancellor has never done what other Lord Chancellors have done,
viz., wielded the fierce democracy of the lower house, shone
unrivalled on the parliamentary arena, thundered from the
platform, won fame by their daring, and acumen, and learning, and
eloquence, in every corner of the land.&nbsp; Indeed, he makes no
pretensions to oratory or greatness of any kind.&nbsp; He is an
able lawyer and eager partisan, little more.&nbsp; In this
respect not at all resembling, or rather very much differing
from, the extraordinary individual who has just darted on the
woolsack, as if he would edge off the Chancellor and take his
very seat.&nbsp; That individual we need not name; a glance at
the nose and plaid trousers&mdash;trousers which he is
incessantly hitching up <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>when he speaks&mdash;are
sufficient.&nbsp; It must be my Lord Brougham, and no one
else.&nbsp; To no other man born of woman has nature vouchsafed
the same power of universality.&nbsp; No other man would attempt
to do what he is now doing, talking law with one man, politics
with another, and scandal with a third, and all the while
listening to the debate, and qualifying himself to take a part in
it.&nbsp; In the course of time we shall see him pursuing an
erratic career in any part of the house except in that one part
in which sit ministers and their supporters.&nbsp; Amongst their
ranks Lord Brougham is never to be found.&nbsp; To the party in
power he is always opposed.&nbsp; It is his pride that he never
worships the rising sun.&nbsp; The Ex-Chancellor has never
forgotten or forgiven the treatment he received, but it does not
affect his health&mdash;it does not tinge his life with
melancholy.&nbsp; He does not let disappointment, like a worm in
the bud, prey upon his damask cheek.&nbsp; His hair is a little
greyer&mdash;his face is a little fatter; that is all the change
the wear and tear of half a century of public life has produced:
and of such a half century! the half century that waged war with
France&mdash;triumphed at Waterloo&mdash;carried
Reform&mdash;repealed the Corn Laws&mdash;and <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>saw the birth
of railways and the electric telegraph; a half century of more
interest than any preceding age&mdash;the work and the excitement
of which wore out our Romillys, Follets, and Horners, with
premature decay.&nbsp; Yet Brougham still lives.&nbsp; Slightly
altering Byron, we may say of him,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Time writes no wrinkles on his brazen brow,<br />
Such as the <i>Edinburgh&rsquo;s</i> dawn beheld he wriggleth
now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below the woolsack is a table, at which Lord Campbell
generally sits; and on each side are ranged the orators and
partizans of the two great sections which, under some name or
other, always have existed and always will exist in our national
history.&nbsp; The uninitiated call them Conservatives and Whigs;
the wiser simply term them the men who are in office and the men
who are not.&nbsp; The Government for the time being sits on the
right hand of the Lord Chancellor, who acts as Speaker, and who
has a far easier berth of it than Mr. Denison.&nbsp; The Lords
are not long-winded, nor noisy; not passionate, and, like true
Britons, always adjourn to dinner.&nbsp; Hence no post-prandial
scenes are visible.&nbsp; In the small hours no patriots,
smelling strongly of whisky-and-water and cigars, expatiate to a
<!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>wearied assembly on that ever fertile theme, the wrongs
and woes of the Green Isle.&nbsp; The Lords, like Mr.
Wordsworth&rsquo;s gods&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Approve the depth but not the tumult of the
soul.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can never fancy the House of Lords to be what you may
sometimes take the House of Commons to be&mdash;a bear garden or
a menagerie.&nbsp; You miss the vulgarity of the one, and you
also miss its excitement and earnestness&mdash;its cries of
&ldquo;question&rdquo; and &ldquo;divide&rdquo; when some
well-known bore is on his legs, and its long resounding cheers
when some favourite partisan sits down.&nbsp; All is staid, and
correct, and proper, with the exception of a tirade from the
Rupert of debate, or some father in God on the Episcopal
Bench.&nbsp; We would fain say a few words about these reverend
gentlemen.&nbsp; One could hardly expect to find the ministers of
the self-denying and lowly Jesus of Nazareth sitting in a
gorgeous house with the proudest and wealthiest of the English
peers.&nbsp; You would expect to find them rather by the bed-side
of the sick, in the houses of the poor, combating with the vice
and infidelity of the day; or else you would look for them in
their studies, surrounded with stately <!-- page 34--><a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>folios; or in
the midst of their clergy, reviving the fainthearted, urging on
the timid, counselling the young, and girding up the energies and
hearts of all.&nbsp; You would expect to find them in the House
of the Lord rather than in the House of Lords.&nbsp; In short,
anywhere but in the turmoil of party conflict.&nbsp; This,
however, is not the case.&nbsp; The bishops are almost the first
object that attracts your eye.&nbsp; They sit on benches by
themselves, on the Government side, but beyond the ministerial
bench.&nbsp; In the &ldquo;dim religious light&rdquo; of the
Upper House, you can scarcely make out what they are.&nbsp; You
see venerable wigs, and black robes, and lawn sleeves; and if you
look sharp, you may, at times, catch the outline of a reverend
face&mdash;most probably of Dr. Tait, the energetic bishop of
London, or of the pug nose and plebeian profile of Samuel of
Oxford.&nbsp; They are very regular in their attendance, and
frequently take part in the debate.&nbsp; Indeed, the latter
bishop is a great man in the Lords; and so was Henry of Exeter,
but his voice is seldom heard, and his name never mentioned now,
though he is generally present, and sits at the end of the
benches nearest to the spectator, while the Archbishop of
Canterbury, who is also pretty <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>regular in
his attendance, occupies the other end of the bench.&nbsp; The
other bishops do not muster quite so strongly.&nbsp; Half of them
is a good attendance.&nbsp; It is to be hoped they are more
profitably employed.</p>
<p>Coming lower down, our eyes rest on the men who did carry on
government, and generally occupy the unenviable situation of
Ministers of the Crown.&nbsp; At present they are out of office,
and are seated on the Lord Chancellor&rsquo;s left.&nbsp;
Generally, at the top of the bench, is seated a slight,
undersized, juvenile, red-haired Scot&mdash;that is the Duke of
Argyle, who, in virtue of being a Duke, and the husband of the
daughter of the Duchess of Sutherland, was Lord Privy Seal.&nbsp;
His lordship is as pert and ready as any forward youth in a
debating-club, and has much of the appearance and manner of such
a one.&nbsp; He gives you no great idea of hereditary
statesmanship, the only quality conspicuous in him being a
tolerable amount of modest assurance, perfectly natural to a peer
who is an author and has lectured at mechanics&rsquo;
institutions, and read papers before the British
Association.&nbsp; By him is seated Lord Panmure, very red in the
face, which redness seems to arise from a military stock which
<!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>he persists in wearing.&nbsp; There sits the Marquis of
Clanricarde, who has suffered much from public opinion, and who
deserves to suffer, if only his conduct in certain electioneering
matters be taken into account.&nbsp; The Earl of Granville is the
leader of this small band; he is a pleasant looking man, and
speaks not badly for a lord.&nbsp; The Whig Nestor, the aged
Marquis of Lansdowne, worthy of remembrance for his friendship
for Tom Moore, is easily detected by his blue coat and brass
buttons, that remnant of the palmy days of party.&nbsp; None of
these men are remarkable for oratorical power.&nbsp; A strong
contrast is presented by the illustrious personage sitting on the
next row, higher up, just opposite the bishops&mdash;a severe,
well-made, heavy, grey-haired man, who sits almost silent and
sullen, as if he had no feelings, as if the debate was a sham,
and he should be glad if it were over.&nbsp; We refer to</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The travelled thane, Athenian
Aberdeen,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the best-abused man, at one time, in her gracious
Majesty&rsquo;s dominions, but without whom, nevertheless, it is
questionable whether the Queen&rsquo;s Government could be
carried on.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Lord Aberdeen is not the man for
the public.&nbsp; <!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>The public likes to be gammoned, and
his lordship cannot gammon.&nbsp; He is spare in words, cold and
unimpassioned in delivery, and somewhat too indifferent to party
attacks.&nbsp; On neighbouring benches are seated discontented
Whigs, overlooked in the scramble for place, and who therefore
view the proceedings of all governments with an impartial, but
yet a jealous eye.&nbsp; Prominent amongst such is the
sandy-looking unamiable Earl Grey, who seems angry with himself
and all the world, because he is lame, and has not the command of
the colonies.&nbsp; Below the table are half-a-dozen benches, on
which congregate a few peers till dinner time.&nbsp; Here sits
Earl Fitzwilliam&mdash;here also sits one of the most frightful
bores in the House, Lord Monteagle, who always speaks, and, for a
lord, cruelly long.&nbsp; That is the consequence of his having
been in the Lower House.&nbsp; Never stop to hear him.&nbsp; As
soon as you see his bald head, be off.&nbsp; The Dukes sit
here.&nbsp; On the front bench on your right is the Duke of
Cambridge.&nbsp; On his left is seated the Duke of Newcastle, a
promising orator when a member of the Lower House, and a follower
of Sir Robert Peel.&nbsp; Crossing to the government benches, the
Earl of Derby fills the first place.&nbsp; We need not <!-- page
38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>paint
his portrait; the sharp aristocratic face&mdash;but feebly
reflected in that promising young man, but unfortunate speaker,
his son&mdash;is familiar to us all; there he is out of
place.&nbsp; He has no fitting opponents.&nbsp; It was among the
Commons that he won his laurels.&nbsp; Yet, at times, the old
afflatus fills him, and his clear voice and fluent declamation
are as bitter and terrible as when night after night he wrestled,
as if for very life, with the brawny champion of Catholic
Emancipation, and the somewhat too selfish, unscrupulous exponent
of Irish wrongs.&nbsp; By his side is his trusty page, the
inelegant and insipid Malmesbury, of whom, in a passing freak,
the author of &ldquo;Vivian Grey&rdquo; not merely made a
statesman, but actually Minister for Foreign Affairs.&nbsp; On
the bench behind the Premier sits that wonderful old man
eloquent, whose shrill tones may occasionally be heard, and whose
intellect seems as great and grand as when he was Sir John
Copley&mdash;Attorney-General before the Reform Bill was carried,
and England, according to Croker, for ever undone.&nbsp; Near him
sits a tall, thin gentleman, with a copious head of hair, and a
force of gesticulation hardly English: that is the Earl of
Ellenborough, in his own opinion hero, statesman, <!-- page
39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>lawyer, &ldquo;all things by turns, and nothing
long;&rdquo; in this respect second only to Lord Brougham, who
sits everywhere, speaks wherever he can, and whose Ciceronian
eloquence, aided by a delivery more expressive than dignified, by
gestures and tones at any rate vivacious, astonish the weak
nerves of the spectators, and oft-times puzzles the parliamentary
reporters themselves.&nbsp; Few other notabilities do we
see.&nbsp; Perhaps we may note on the opposition benches the pale
aristocratic form of that popular nobleman, the Earl of
Shaftesbury.&nbsp; Disraeli makes one of his peers say, the House
of Lords looks like a house of butlers.&nbsp; We think the
satirist is unjust.&nbsp; At any rate, the peers are well
dressed.&nbsp; Hats, gloves, boots, and frock-coats are all
unexceptionable.&nbsp; We need not say, in this respect, the
House of Lords presents a very different appearance to the House
of Commons.&nbsp; Yet the Lords need not be so particular about
their &ldquo;gorgeous array;&rdquo; there are seldom more than
half-a-dozen ladies present to admire and reward their
display.&nbsp; The Lords are more polite than the Commons.&nbsp;
Such ladies as are present take their seats in the gallery, where
they can see and be seen; in the other house, as our readers <!--
page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>know, the case is different.&nbsp; But even the ladies,
we dare say, would not mind being treated as the Commons treat
them, if the debates in the Lords were as good as in the
Commons.&nbsp; If the peers did not dress so well, and were not
so excessively polite, but spoke better, no great harm would be
done; but there&rsquo;s the difficulty.&nbsp; It is difficult for
a polite man to be ill-bred, and to lose his temper, and say
sharp things.&nbsp; In the House of Commons nothing is
easier.&nbsp; Say something bitter, and you will have a murmur of
applause&mdash;be savage, and at any rate your own party will
cheer; but in the Lords you can&rsquo;t get up the semblance of
earnestness.&nbsp; The whole thing seems too much like
play&mdash;an apology for business, and that is all.&nbsp; No man
can speak to twenty sleepy peers as he could to four or five
hundred eager partisans.&nbsp; No man can be impressive in the
bosom of his family&mdash;and the Lords are a family party, all
connected, or nearly so; and if a stranger comes in, he soon apes
the fashionable tone, and becomes as dull and apathetic as the
rest.&nbsp; And why should a lord be otherwise?&nbsp; A lord is
not more a lord for having brains&mdash;nor the less a lord for
being without.&nbsp; Intellect, skill, oratory, are no
helps&mdash;are unnecessary <!-- page 41--><a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>in an
hereditary institution.&nbsp; Sir Robert Peel knew this, and
lived and died a commoner.&nbsp; Chatham became comparatively a
small man when he took a pension and a peerage.&nbsp; So was it
with Walpole, when meeting his old rival Pulteney, after they had
both been raised to the peerage, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Here we
are, my lord, the two most insignificant personages in
Europe.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Upper House but registers the decisions
of the Lower&mdash;the business of the country is carried on
elsewhere.</p>
<p>But while we have been looking at the House, the debate has
closed.&nbsp; Lord Granville has asked a question and made an
attack.&nbsp; Lord Derby has uttered a few petulant remarks, to
which Lord Aberdeen has made a cold and formal reply, to which
some peers, disappointed of place, have added a little
independent criticism on their own account.&nbsp; Two or three
exquisites have been discussing little matters of their own, till
they find that if they stop much longer they will be too late for
Rotten Row, and the House merely waits for Lord Monteagle to sit
down and go home.&nbsp; Happily his lordship is briefer than his
wont, and the Lord High Chancellor declares the House
adjourned.&nbsp; Rushing outside, we catch <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>hasty
glimpses of our hereditary legislators as they, in fashionable
brougham or on splendid blood, start for their parks or
respective Belgravian homes.&nbsp; We also, in more plebeian
manner, do the same.&nbsp; We are sure the reader will have had
enough of the Lords for one night.&nbsp; He will have found out
that they are not much better orators or speakers than other
men&mdash;that even lords stammer, utter incoherent remarks,
display poverty of ideas.&nbsp; Let us add, in conclusion, the
great merit of a night in the Lords is, that it is soon
over.&nbsp; If the Lords be dull, at any rate they are
short.&nbsp; To be dull and long-winded is an offence against
good breeding of which few peers are guilty.</p>

43</span>THE REPORTERS&rsquo; GALLERY.</h2>
<p>If it has ever been your lot, most magnanimous sir, to be in
the neighbourhood of Westminster Hall about four any afternoon
while Parliament is sitting, you must have observed more than one
individual, with cheeks evidently &ldquo;sicklied o&rsquo;er with
the pale cast of thought,&rdquo; rushing into the door which
leads to the Strangers&rsquo; Gallery in the House of
Commons.&nbsp; If, however, you look well, you will see that the
parties referred to, instead of going the whole length of the
passage, as you are compelled to do when occasionally you get an
order, turn sharply to the left and climb a flight of narrow
stairs.&nbsp; If you manage to follow them, you will find at the
top of the stairs a small lobby, where three or four boys, in the
livery of the Electric Telegraph Company, are waiting to receive
the parliamentary report, which almost immediately after is
flashing along the wires to our great hives of industry, of
intelligence, and life, or to the capitals of other
lands&mdash;to Paris&mdash;<!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>to
Vienna&mdash;to Berlin.&nbsp; You turn to the left and enter a
small room set apart for refreshments&mdash;three or four
individuals are seated at table, one drinking Bass&rsquo;s
far-famed ale, another feasting on juicy beef, another regaling
himself with brandy-and-water, and another sipping the less
stimulating and equally agreeable produce of the coffee
plant.&nbsp; The happy fellows are poking their fun at each other
in a mild and pleasant way, or possibly discussing the usual
political topics of the day; others flit through the room with a
celerity, as Mr. Squeers said of nature, easier imagined than
described.&nbsp; Were they followed by gentlemen of Hebrew
extraction, with those mysterious little slips of paper which
contain letters of such magic power, they could not walk
faster.&nbsp; As you listen, utterances of doubtful and dire
import fall from their lips.&nbsp; &ldquo;Palmerston is
up,&rdquo; says one.&nbsp; You are alarmed; you think the
bottle-holder is in a rage, and you tremble for the
consequences.&nbsp; Again you hear, &ldquo;Lord John is
down;&rdquo; you are distressed at the intelligence, the old
champion of civil and religious liberty you hoped would long have
been preserved from such a catastrophe.&nbsp; The gentlemen
around you, however, listen to such statements <!-- page 45--><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>with the
coolness of stoics, paying little or no regard to such
announcements.&nbsp; One says to another, &ldquo;When are you
on?&rdquo; another demands of his friend, whether he is off;
another says he comes on at nine.&nbsp; You are puzzled to know
what manner of men you are amongst.&nbsp; They are not strangers
fresh from the country&mdash;they have too pale and town-like a
look for that; they are not members&mdash;because members feast
in another part of the house.&nbsp; You will soon see what they
are! you leave that room and enter another, in which are a few
well-dressed personages transcribing hurriedly, as if for
life.&nbsp; The truth flashes upon you.&nbsp; &ldquo;These men
are the reporters,&rdquo; you exclaim.&nbsp; For once, my good
sir, you are right; and if you go through that glass-door you
will find yourself in the <span class="smcap">Reporters&rsquo;
Gallery</span>.</p>
<p>We will suppose that for this time only the doorkeeper has
relaxed his usual vigilance, and you have managed to effect an
entrance.&nbsp; There is as much difficulty in getting a stranger
into the Reporters&rsquo; Gallery as in getting Baron Rothschild
into the House.&nbsp; As the gallery will not hold more than
thirty, it is quite right this should be the case.&nbsp; On the
back seats the reporters are sitting idle&mdash;some criticising
the speakers in <!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>a manner anything but
complimentary&mdash;some sleeping&mdash;some reading a quarterly;
but on the front seat you see some dozen or thirteen, each in a
little box to himself, busily engaged.&nbsp; If the speaker be a
great gun, the reporter puts forward his utmost energies and
takes down every word&mdash;if he be one of the illustrious
obscure the task is less difficult, and a patient public is saved
the painful duty of reading the <i>ipsissima verba</i> of Smith
or Brown.&nbsp; Beside the reporter, in some cases, sits another
gentleman, who has, comparatively speaking, an easier office to
perform.&nbsp; He is the gentleman that does the parliamentary
summary to which you instinctively turn, instead of wading
through the eight or nine columns that give the debate
itself.&nbsp; I believe the summary writer in the gallery remains
all night, while the reporters take their turns, which last on an
average half an hour.&nbsp; Thus, no sooner has a reporter been
at his post for that time, than he leaves the house and rushes up
to the office to copy out his notes; this may take him an
hour.&nbsp; He then returns, and is ready to go on again when he
is due.&nbsp; It would be utterly impossible for one man to
report a debate and then to copy out his notes, and be in time
for the paper of the next <!-- page 47--><a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>morning;
consequently each paper is compelled to have a body of nine or
ten parliamentary reporters, and these reporters, in order that
they may all have an equal chance, vary their turns every
week.&nbsp; Thus the man who goes on one week at four, goes the
next at a later hour&mdash;and the reporter who is one week in
the Commons, perhaps the next has the honour of sitting in the
House of Lords.&nbsp; Otherwise the hard work might fall to a
few, and the rest might take it very easy indeed.</p>
<p>As we don&rsquo;t happen to be reporting, we will look about
us a little.&nbsp; We will report reporters as they are: on our
left, just below us, is the reporter for the <i>Star</i>; next
comes the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, then the <i>Advertiser</i>, and
then the <i>Daily News</i>.&nbsp; Three boxes are occupied by the
<i>Times</i>: one for the reporters, one for the summary writer,
and one for the manager of the <i>Times</i> parliamentary
staff.&nbsp; On the other side are the <i>Chronicle</i> reporter
and summary writer, the <i>Herald</i> ditto, and the
<i>Post</i>.&nbsp; Up to six o&rsquo;clock in the evening the
<i>Globe</i>, and the <i>Sun</i>, and the <i>Express</i> have
each a parliamentary reporter present.&nbsp; The gallery is under
the care of Lord Charles Russell, Sergeant-at-Arms, who is sadly
<!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>put to it where to stow the gentlemen of the press, who
have increased far beyond the limits of the gallery.&nbsp; Behind
the gallery are rooms in which some reporters write out their
notes; and so hot and inconvenient are they, that his lordship
has latterly acceded to the reporters a committee room attached
for such as need it.&nbsp; Behind the gallery also is a
refreshment room, and a policeman to keep out intruders.&nbsp; A
few of the weekly papers have reporters in on Thursday and Friday
nights, and these constitute the only habitu&eacute;s of the
gallery.&nbsp; Of course the aspect of the house is different to
what it is when viewed from the Strangers&rsquo; Gallery.&nbsp;
You miss the Speaker and his ornamental chair and majestic wig,
but you have a better view of the gangway and the bar&mdash;you
see the Sergeant-at-Arms, wearing a sword, seated on his easy
chair&mdash;that chair being made easy by the receipt of twelve
hundred a year.&nbsp; You see the gallery under the
Strangers&rsquo; Gallery in which peers, and members&rsquo; sons,
and old M.P.&rsquo;s occasionally sit; and now and then, through
the glass door by which members enter, you see a bonnet, a bit of
muslin&mdash;the lustre of some female eye&mdash;denoting that
woman in her loveliness is taking note of the Conscript
Fathers.&nbsp; <!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>This reminds us that the
Reporters&rsquo; Gallery is just under the little cage in which
the British fair are confined during a debate.&nbsp; The
consequence is to some of the reporters who wear moustaches, and
cultivate the art of killing&mdash;who get themselves up in a
very different style to your fathers of families&mdash;a
Barmecide feast of the most cruel kind.&nbsp; They hear the
murmur of female voices, not always &ldquo;gentle and
low&rdquo;&mdash;they know that, shining like stars above them,
are forms such as &ldquo;might melt the saintship of an
anchorite;&rdquo; that above them are eyes more eloquent than the
tongues below, but they cannot realise what they can imagine; and
whilst music comes to them&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Like ocean which upon the moonlight
shores<br />
Of lone Sig&aelig;um steals with murmuring noise,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>they must take down the common sense of common men; such is
their cruel fate.&nbsp; And now one word about our
companions.&nbsp; Most of them are young men&mdash;some are in
their prime.&nbsp; None of them are old; old reporters are only
met with where dead donkeys and departed postboys are
common.&nbsp; At any rate they are not engaged on the morning
papers: the late hours, the hard stretch of mind required in a
reporter, don&rsquo;t exactly suit old men.&nbsp; If you think
reporting easy, <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>my good sir, you are most egregiously
mistaken.&nbsp; It takes you two or three years to master
shorthand sufficiently to assume your place as a reporter in the
gallery.&nbsp; When you have done that, you will find that you
don&rsquo;t get your money for nothing, I can assure you.&nbsp;
You must for half an hour take down all you can hear; you must
then copy that out into long-hand and plain English as best you
can.&nbsp; You must then come back into the house and take
another turn, and so on, till the house is up; and then, worn and
weary, you must again trudge to the office, and there indite the
copy which, before the ink with which it is written is dry, is in
the composing-room and in type.&nbsp; As this may detain you till
four o&rsquo;clock in the morning, you are then at liberty to
retire to your bed, if it suit you, or to the flowers and early
purl of Covent Garden, if it be summer time, and you are of a
sentimental turn.&nbsp; Now, occasionally, it is all very well to
sit up till three or four o&rsquo;clock in the morning; London
then is invested with a grandeur and stillness very impressive:
the air is fresh and pure, bearing with it the odours of the
country; the grand Cathedral of St. Paul looms proudly before
you; the streets seem broader, longer than <!-- page 51--><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>usual; and,
far off, we catch glimpses of Hampstead or of the Surrey hills;
but when you have to see this, not once, but every morning, the
case is altered, the spell is broken, and the charm is gone; and
such a life must tell, sooner or later, upon the
constitution.&nbsp; Reporters are not rosy, jolly men; they
don&rsquo;t look like Barry Cornwall&rsquo;s happy squires,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;With
brains made clear<br />
By the irresistible strength of beer.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of them live well, and are protected against the
inclemencies of the weather.&nbsp; The reporters of the <i>Daily
News</i> and <i>Times</i> come down in cabs, but they appear
delicate hothouse plants; though, after all, they do not look
worse than a popular M.P., such as Lord Dudley Stuart or Mr.
Milner Gibson, at the end of a session.&nbsp; As a class, we have
already hinted, the reporters are intellectual men; among them
are many who have embraced literature as the noblest of all
professions, and have as sacredly devoted themselves to it as, in
old times, priests did to the service of their gods.&nbsp; You
can tell these by their youthful flush and lofty foreheads.&nbsp;
A time may come when the world may seduce them from the service,
when all generous aspirations may fade away, when crushing <!--
page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>selfishness shall make them common as other men.&nbsp;
Then there are others to whom reporting is a mere mechanical
calling, and nothing else; who do their week&rsquo;s work and
take their week&rsquo;s wages, and are satisfied; but most of the
parliamentary reporters are clever men, and all aspire to that
character.&nbsp; The mistake is one a little self-love will
easily induce a man to make.&nbsp; Men of infinite wit and spirit
have been in the gallery; therefore, the men in the gallery now
are men of infinite wit and spirit.&nbsp; A gorgeous superiority
over other men is thus tacitly assumed.&nbsp; You will hear of
such a one, that he was a reporter on the <i>Times</i>, but he
was not clever enough for that, and so they made him an
M.P.&nbsp; But, after all, no man of great genius will report
long if he can help it: reporting is a terrible drudgery.&nbsp; A
man who can write his thoughts well will not willingly spend his
time in copying out the thoughts of others.&nbsp; Dickens was a
reporter for the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, but he, though his
talent in that way was great, though he could perform almost
unparalleled feats as a reporter, soon left the gallery.&nbsp; At
one time Angus Reach was in the gallery; there, till recently,
might have been seen that accomplished critic and delightful
novelist Shirley Brooks.&nbsp; For a literary <!-- page 53--><a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>man reporting
is a capital crutch: he is well paid, and it often leads to
something else.&nbsp; The <i>Times</i>&rsquo; reporters are
divided into three classes, none of whom get less than seven
guineas a week.&nbsp; The other papers do not pay quite so well;
but a literary man, if he be in earnest, can live on less than
that till the day comes when the world owns him and he becomes
great; and if his dream of fancied greatness be but a
dream&mdash;if hope never realise the flattering tale she at one
time told, still he has a means of respectable livelihood, and
may rise from a reporter into an editor.&nbsp; Mr. James Grant,
editor of the <i>Morning Advertiser</i>, was at one time reporter
for that paper.&nbsp; In some cases the ambition of the reporter
does not end quite so successfully.&nbsp; Only recently a
reporter for one of the morning papers contested an Irish
borough.&nbsp; Unfortunately, instead of being returned, the
ambitious youth was thrown into gaol for an insignificant tavern
bill of merely &pound;250 for eleven days.&nbsp; What
cruelty!&nbsp; What talent, what hope, what failure, have there
not been in the Reporters&rsquo; Gallery!&nbsp; And those who
know it, if they wanted, could find abundance of material there
with which</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To point a moral or adorn a
tale.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>Perhaps, after all, in nothing is the astonishing
improvement made in these latter times so conspicuous as in our
system of parliamentary reporting.&nbsp; The House was in terror
when reporters first found their way into it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,
sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Winnington, addressing the Speaker,
&ldquo;you will have every word that is spoken here
misrepresented by fellows who thrust themselves into our
gallery.&nbsp; You will have the speeches of this House printed
every day during your session, and we shall be looked upon as the
most contemptible assembly on the face of the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In consequence of such attacks as these, the reporters became
frightened, and gave the debates with the speakers disguised
under Roman names, though nothing could be more wearisome than
the small type of the political club, where Publicola talked
against turnpike-gates and Tullus Hostilius declaimed on the
horrors of drinking gin.&nbsp; Nor is it to be wondered at that
the House grew angry when such reports as the following professed
to be a faithful account of its proceedings: &ldquo;Colonel
Barr&eacute; moved, that Jeremiah Weymouth, the d---n of this
kingdom, is not a member of this House.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even when
the reporters triumphed, the public were little benefited.&nbsp;
Nothing can <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>be more tantalising than such
statements as these, which we meet with in old parliamentary
reports: &ldquo;Mr. Sheridan now rose, and, during the space of
five hours and forty minutes, commanded the admiration and
attention of the House by an oration of almost unexampled
excellence, uniting the most convincing closeness and accuracy of
argument with the most luminous precision and perspicuity of
language; and alternately giving force and energy to truth by
solid and substantial reasoning, and enlightening the most
extensive and involved subjects with the purest clearness of
logic, and the brightest splendour of rhetoric.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Sheridan&rsquo;s leader fared no better.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr.
Fox,&rdquo; we are told, &ldquo;was wonderfully pleasant on Lord
Clive&rsquo;s joining the administration.&rdquo;&nbsp; Equal
injustice is done to Mr. Burke.&nbsp; We read, &ldquo;Mr. Burke
turned, twisted, metamorphosed, and represented everything which
the right honourable gentleman (Mr. Pitt) had advanced, with so
many ridiculous forms, that the House was kept in a continual
roar of laughter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again: &ldquo;Mr. Burke enforced
these beautiful and affecting statements by a variety of splendid
and affecting passages from the Latin classics.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
is no wonder, then, that a prejudice should have existed against
the <!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>reporters.&nbsp; On a motion made by Lord Stanhope, that
the short-hand writers employed on the trial of Hastings be
summoned to the bar of the House to read their minutes, Lord
Loughborough is reported, in Lord Campbell&rsquo;s life of him,
to have said, &ldquo;God forbid that ever their lordships should
call on the short-hand writers to publish their notes; for of all
people, short-hand writers were ever the furthest from
correctness, and there were no man&rsquo;s words they ever had
that they again returned.&nbsp; They were in general ignorant, as
acting mechanically and not by considering the antecedents, and
by catching the sound and not the sense they perverted the sense
of the speaker, and made him appear as ignorant as
themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; At a later period, the audacity and
impudence of the reporters increased; loud and numerous were the
complaints made against them.&nbsp; Mr. Wilberforce, who really
deserved better treatment at their hands, read to the House, on
one occasion, an extract from a newspaper, in which he was
reported as having said, &ldquo;Potatoes make men healthy,
vigorous, and active; but what is still more in their favour,
they make men tall; more especially was he led to say so as being
rather under the common size, and he must lament that <!-- page
57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>his
guardians had not fostered him upon that genial
vegetable.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Martin, of Galway, has immortalised
himself by his complaint made about the same time, though based
upon a less solid foundation than that of the great
Abolitionist.&nbsp; The reporter having dashed his pen under some
startling passages which had fallen from the Hibernian
orator&rsquo;s lips, the printer was called to the bar.&nbsp; In
defence he put in the report, containing the very words.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said Martin; &ldquo;<i>but did I spake
them in italics</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course the printer was
nonplussed by such a question, and the House was convulsed with
laughter.&nbsp; Happily, this state of things no longer exists,
and, in the language of Mr. Macaulay, it is now universally felt
&ldquo;that the gallery in which the reporters sit, has become a
fourth estate of the realm.&rdquo;&nbsp; The publication of the
debates, which seemed to the most liberal statesmen full of
danger to the great safeguards of public liberty, is now regarded
by many persons as a safeguard tantamount, and more than
tantamount, to all the rest put together.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give
me,&rdquo; said Sheridan, whilst fighting the battle of the
reporters on the floor of the House&mdash;&ldquo;give me but the
liberties of the press, and I will give to the <!-- page 58--><a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>minister a
venal House of Peers&mdash;I will give him a corrupt and servile
House of Commons&mdash;I will give him the whole host of
ministerial influence&mdash;I will give him all the power that
place can confer upon him to purchase up submission and overawe
resistance&mdash;and yet, armed with the liberties of the press,
I will go forth to meet him undismayed; I will attack the mighty
fabric he has raised with that mightier engine.&nbsp; I will
shake down from its height corruption, and bury it beneath the
ruins of the abuses it was meant to shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reporters have now a comfortable gallery to
themselves&mdash;they have cushions as soft to sit upon as those
of M.P.&rsquo;s&mdash;they have plenty of room to write in, and
whilst they wait their turns they may indulge in criticism on
high art or Chinese literature&mdash;on the divine melodies of
Jenny Lind, or the merits of Mr. Cobden&mdash;a very favourite
topic with reporters&mdash;or go to sleep.&nbsp; Mr. Jerdan, in
his Memoirs, tells how different it was in his day; then the
reporters had only access to the Strangers&rsquo; Gallery, and
could only make sure of getting in there by being the first in
the crowd that generally was collected previous to its being
opened.&nbsp; But about the smart new gallery there are no
associations on which memory cares to <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>dwell.&nbsp;
It was different under the late one; old Sam Johnson sat there
with his shabby black and unwieldy bulk, taking care to remember
just enough of the debate to convince the public that &ldquo;the
Whig dogs,&rdquo; to use his own expressive language, &ldquo;had
the worst of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; We can fancy Cave, of the
&ldquo;Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine,&rdquo; with a friend in the
gallery, stealthily, for fear they should be detected and turned
out, taking a few brief notes of the debate, and then, at the
taproom of the nearest public-house, amidst the fumes of tobacco
and beer, writing out as much as they could, which Guthrie then
revised, and which afterwards appeared in the magazine under the
head of &ldquo;Debates in Great Lilliput.&rdquo;&nbsp; Woodfall
we see&mdash;the Woodfall of Junius&mdash;his pocket stuffed with
cold, hard-boiled eggs&mdash;sitting out the livelong debate, and
then writing out so much of it as his powerful memory
retained&mdash;a task which often occupied him till noon the next
day, but which gave the &ldquo;Diary&rdquo; a good sale, till
Perry, of the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>&mdash;Perry, the friend of
Coleridge and of Moore&mdash;introduced the principle of the
division of labour, and was thus enabled to get out the
<i>Chronicle</i> long before Woodfall&rsquo;s report
appeared.</p>
<p>We see rollicking roysterous reporters, full of <!-- page
60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>wine
and fun, committing all kinds of absurdity.&nbsp; For instance,
one night the debate has been very heavy&mdash;at length a dead
silence prevails, suddenly a voice is heard demanding a song from
Mr. Speaker.&nbsp; If an angel had fallen from heaven, it is
questionable whether a greater sensation could have been
created.&nbsp; The House is in a roar.&nbsp; Poor Addington, the
Speaker, is overwhelmed with indignation and amazement.&nbsp;
Pitt can hardly keep his seat for laughing.&nbsp; Up into the
gallery rushes the Sergeant-at-Arms to take the delinquent into
custody.&nbsp; No one knows who he is&mdash;at any rate no one
will tell.&nbsp; At length, as the officer gets impatient and
angry, a hand is pointed to a fat placid Quaker without guile,
seated in the middle of the crowd.&nbsp; Much to his amazement,
on his devoted yet innocent person straightway rushes the
Sergeant-at-Arms; and protesting, but in vain, the wearer of
square-collar and broad-brim is borne off to gaol.&nbsp; The real
delinquent is Mark Supple, a big-boned, loud-voiced, rollicking
Irish blade&mdash;just such a man as we fancy M., of the <i>Daily
News</i>, to be.&nbsp; Mark has been dining.&nbsp; He is a
devoted follower of Bacchus; and, at this time, happens to be
extraordinarily well primed.&nbsp; Hence his remarkable <!-- page
61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>contribution, if not to the business, at any rate to the
amusement, of the evening.&nbsp; People call the present times
fast; but men lived faster then.&nbsp; Sheridan drank brandy when
he spoke.&nbsp; Pitt made one of his most brilliant speeches just
after he had been vomiting from the quantity of port he had
previously been drinking.&nbsp; Members, when they came into the
House, not unfrequently saw two speakers where, in reality, there
was but one; and the reporters were often in a state of similar
bewilderment themselves: but they are gone, and the oratory they
recorded has vanished from the senate.&nbsp; In the new gallery
they can never hear what was heard in the old&mdash;the
philosophy of Burke&mdash;the wit of Sheridan&mdash;the
passionate attacks of Fox&mdash;or the cool replies of
Pitt.&nbsp; The House has become less oratorical&mdash;less an
imperial senate, more of a national &ldquo;vestry.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It discusses fewer principles, and more railway bills.&nbsp; The
age of Pitt and Fox went with Pitt and Fox.&nbsp; You cannot
recall it&mdash;the age has altered.&nbsp; You find Pitt and Fox
now in the newspaper office, not in the senate.&nbsp; The old
gallery has looked down on great men.&nbsp; It could tell of an
heroic race and of heroic deeds.&nbsp; It had seen the angry
Charles.&nbsp; <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>It had heard Cromwell bid the mace be
gone.&nbsp; It had re-echoed the first indignant accents of the
elder Pitt.&nbsp; It had outlived a successful revolution.&nbsp;
It had witnessed the triumph of reform.&nbsp; Can the new one
witness more?</p>
<p>So much for the Reporters&rsquo; Gallery.&nbsp; We cannot take
leave of the subject without remarking what obligations members
are under to it.&nbsp; No man can long attend parliamentary
debates without being very strongly impressed with that one great
fact.&nbsp; The orators who are addressing empty benches and
inattentive audiences are, in reality, speaking to the dozen
reporters just before them.&nbsp; Colonel Sibthorpe, when he
spoke, turned his face to them, in order that they might not miss
a single word.&nbsp; You did not, the last time you were in the
house, hear a single atom of Jones&rsquo;s speech; you could
merely see Jones, with an unhappy expression of face, and to the
infinite annoyance of the House, waving his arms in an inelegant
manner; yet how well Jones&rsquo;s speech read in the
<i>Times</i> the next day.&nbsp; Once upon a time a paper
attempted to report literally what the members said&mdash;not
what they should have said.&nbsp; They were threatened with so
many actions for libel that they were all obliged to abandon the
attempt; <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>and now the reporters take care that
the speeches contain good grammar, if they do not contain good
sense.&nbsp; Nor, most good-natured sir, are you under fewer
obligations.&nbsp; It is owing to them that you read the debate
over your muffins and coffee at your ease, in your morning gown
and slippers, whilst otherwise you would have to remain in
profound ignorance of it altogether, or would have to fight your
way into the gallery as best you could, besides running a risk of
catching cold or having your favourite corn trod on.&nbsp; Think,
then, of the Reporters&rsquo; Gallery leniently.&nbsp; The brave
fellows in it suffer much for you.&nbsp; Cowper makes the slave
in the &ldquo;Negro&rsquo;s Complaint&rdquo; exclaim&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Think ye, masters, iron-hearted,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lolling at your jovial boards,<br />
Think how many backs have smarted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the sweets your cane affords.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A thinking public, at times, should reason in a similar
manner.&nbsp; The reporters don&rsquo;t find it all play.&nbsp;
People should remember&mdash;if a debate be dull to
read&mdash;how terrible it must be to hear!</p>

64</span>THE LOBBY OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS DURING THE
SESSION.</h2>
<p>England, Ireland, Scotland, and our forty colonies are ruled,
not from Downing-street, not from Privy Councils at Buckingham
Palace, nor by the <i>Times</i> newspaper, as some pretend, nor
even by the stump orator, but by the Lobby of the House of
Commons.&nbsp; This I know, that if I were a member of the United
Kingdom Alliance, and wished to root up the liquor traffic in
England&mdash;that if I were a Scotchman, and endeavoured to
confirm and extend the provisions of the Forbes Mackenzie
Act&mdash;that even were I of the Green Isle, and raised the cry
of justice for Ireland, whatever that may mean&mdash;I&rsquo;d
plant myself in the Lobby of the House of Commons, and there win
victory or die.</p>
<p>Externally the Lobby is a handsome one; little more.&nbsp; Mr.
Timbs tells me it is &ldquo;a rich apartment, forty-five feet
square, and has on each side an archway, carved open screens,
inscribed <!-- page 65--><a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span><i>Domine salvam fac Reginam</i>, and
windows painted with the arms of parliamentary boroughs.&nbsp;
The brass gas standards by Hardman are elaborately chased.&nbsp;
The doorways lead to the library, the post-office, vote paper
office, central hall, &amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is this all?&nbsp;
Yes, is the answer of one of the matter-of-fact class, of whom
Peter Bell is such an illustrious example.</p>
<p>We are not all Peter Bells.&nbsp; We are of those who can read
sermons in stones.&nbsp; We fancy for every why there is a
wherefore.&nbsp; Wealthy men, and busy men, and great men,
don&rsquo;t stand talking and grimacing for nothing; and when I
catch one member in a corner with Brown I am not greenhorn enough
to suppose that they are merely inquiring after each
other&rsquo;s health, or commenting on the extraordinary mildness
of the season, and its probable effect on the growth of
cabbages.&nbsp; No, no, you may be certain that the Lobby of the
House of Commons, where I have seen our greatest statesmen, our
proudest peers, the nation&rsquo;s most illustrious guests,
ambassadors, and princes, and wags, is not the place for small
talk.&nbsp; Without studying &ldquo;De Morgan on
Probabilities&rdquo; (a sin of which I am never likely to be
guilty), you will not be far wrong if you come to the conclusion
<!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>that in the Lobby, somehow or other, between the hours 4
<span class="smcap">p.m.</span> and 2 <span
class="smcap">a.m.</span>, not a little business is settled more
or less agreeable to all parties concerned.&nbsp; (Of course I am
not referring to the young sprigs of nobility, who come into the
House merely as an amusement, and without the slightest idea of
the rights and duties of their class, and who are neither more
nor less than a parody upon the representative system of which we
are all so proud.)&nbsp; A few sentences will point to the
significancy of the Lobby.&nbsp; Every member of the House of
Commons passes through the Lobby.&nbsp; That is a given
fact.&nbsp; Another is, that the Treasury Whipper-in affects the
Lobby.&nbsp; Another is, that if you have anything to say to your
member, or if he has anything to say to you, the Lobby is the
place of rendezvous.&nbsp; These facts are suggestive.&nbsp; I am
member for Bullock Smithy.&nbsp; I am not wealthy, and I have a
large family.&nbsp; The Ministry are hard driven, one vote will
save them.&nbsp; I meet their Whipper-in in the Lobby.&nbsp; We
have a little chat.&nbsp; I give an honest vote, and virtue is
rewarded by the appointment of my son to a place in the
Circumlocution Office.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is an
exaggeration!&rdquo; exclaims the general public.&nbsp; Let me
then, give another case.&nbsp; I am <!-- page 67--><a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>member for
Bullock Smithy; I am rich, but I have no family, and I am a man
of no birth.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d give my ears, and my wife would not
merely give them, but her diamond earrings as well, to see her
name in the <i>Court Circular</i>, or to get a ticket to Lady
Plantagenet&rsquo;s Sunday-evening parties.&nbsp; Promiscuously I
hint this in the Lobby, and lo! the magician&rsquo;s wand waves,
and I and my wife enter the stately portals we had long aspired
to cross.&nbsp; If certain parties, in the course of the
parliamentary session, find there is nothing lost by civility,
where&rsquo;s the harm?&nbsp; But look round the Lobby; the
electioneering agent is there to discuss how to make things
pleasant; the getter-up of public companies comes there to catch
a few M.P.&rsquo;s as directors.&nbsp; There is the local
deputation of the Stoke Gas Company&mdash;limited
liability&mdash;whose Bill stand for reading a third time
to-night; and there is the Secretary of the United Metropolitan
Association for making every householder consume his own
smoke.&nbsp; Smith from the provinces has caught his
member&rsquo;s eye, and has got an order for the gallery.&nbsp;
Alas, Smith, the gallery has been full this hour; and there are
now fifty individuals, fortunate holders of orders like yourself,
waiting their turn.&nbsp; Here is &ldquo;Our <!-- page 68--><a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>Correspondent&rdquo; gossiping with the door-keepers,
attacking every member with whom he is on speaking terms, in
order that he may concoct the luminous epistles which form the
attraction of the paper whose columns he adorns.&nbsp; This man
is a spouter at public-house discussion clubs, and fancies
himself, as he stands surrounded by M.P.&rsquo;s, almost an M.P.
himself.&nbsp; What does he here?&nbsp; I know not, except waste
his time.&nbsp; A grand debate is coming on; a ministerial crisis
is imminent.&nbsp; How full the Lobby gets; and how scrutinised
is every action of hon. gentlemen as they take a turn, as they
all do in the course of the evening, in the Lobby!&nbsp; There is
the leader of the Opposition; he meets his bitterest foe, and
bows to him and smiles.&nbsp; In what agony are the quidnuncs to
know the hidden meaning of that bow and smile!&nbsp; The
Ministerialist Whipper-in has a little book in his hand, and is
busy in his calculation.&nbsp; By the twinkle in his eye I fancy
it is all right; and now he may whistle &ldquo;Begone, dull care,
I prythee begone from me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He need not fear next
quarter-day.&nbsp; Ah! that cheer which comes sounding to us
through the glass doors denotes that the Premier has concluded
his defence, and that the House is on his side.&nbsp; But out
rushes the Sergeant-at-Arms.&nbsp; &ldquo;Clear the Lobby <!--
page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>for a division,&rdquo; exclaim the door-keepers.&nbsp;
The police point us the door: we take the hint while all the
bells are tinkling, and all the members are rushing from every
quarter, through the Lobby to the House, as if members and bells
were alike mad.&nbsp; We wait outside.&nbsp; By the clock nearly
a half-hour is gone.&nbsp; Hark, what a cheer!&nbsp; By Jove! the
division is taken, and the ministry are saved.&nbsp; It is
midnight; yet the Lobby is full and gay.&nbsp; We won&rsquo;t go
home yet.&nbsp; Just behind is the bar, and members are drinking
pale ale and sherry, and soda with a little brandy in it, and the
whole place begins to have the air of the London Tavern after an
anniversary dinner on behalf of the Indignant Blind.&nbsp; Look
at those swells just entering the House: evidently they have been
dining out, and presently one of them will speak, and the whole
House will be in a roar at his vinous oratory; out in the Lobby
we catch faint echoes of the mirth.&nbsp; The House is in
committee on the Cab Act, and are now enacting a clause relative
to drunken and disorderly cabmen.&nbsp; Our friend is vehement,
inconclusive, and indistinct.&nbsp; Happily the reporters will
merely mention that he addressed the House amidst considerable
laughter.&nbsp; As we leave the Lobby, we hear hints about
&ldquo;physician, heal thyself.&rdquo;</p>

70</span>OUR LONDON CORRESPONDENT.</h2>
<p>Where&rsquo;s Eliza?&nbsp; Who was the man in the iron
mask?&nbsp; Who was Junius?&nbsp; Whose were the bones discovered
last year in a carpet-bag under Waterloo-bridge?&nbsp; You cannot
tell.&nbsp; Neither can I tell you who is our London
Correspondent.&nbsp; Yet he exists.&nbsp; I find traces of him in
the most B&oelig;otian districts of England.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Caledonia, stern and wild,<br />
Fit nurse for a poetic child,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>knows him.&nbsp; In &ldquo;Tara&rsquo;s halls&rdquo; he has
superseded the harp, and is a presence and a power.&nbsp; Before
newspapers were, when Addison was writing the
&ldquo;Spectator,&rdquo; and Dick Steele &ldquo;Tatlers&rdquo;
innumerable, and De Foe his Review and all sorts of romances, in
Grub-street there was an immense deal of activity in the way of
letter writing.&nbsp; Country gentlemen wanted news, and were
willing to pay for it.&nbsp; When there was a frost or when it
was wet, when the nights were long or amusements few, when the
squire was laid up with the <!-- page 71--><a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>gout or when
my lady had the vapours, it was pleasant to read who ate
cheesecakes and syllabubs at Spring Gardens, who drank coffee at
Button&rsquo;s or chocolate at the Cocoa Tree, what was the
gossip of the October or Kit Kat clubs, what had become of Mrs.
Bracegirdle, and how Mrs. Oldfield triumphed on the stage.&nbsp;
Nor did the letter-writer stop here.&nbsp; In those days
courtiers had two faces.&nbsp; There was one King <i>de
facto</i>, and another <i>de jure divino</i>.&nbsp; There was a
Court at St. Germains as well as at St. James&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
There were Jacobites as well as Hanoverians.&nbsp; There were
plots and intrigues&mdash;Popish and Protestant&mdash;and in the
dark days before Christmas, in old country houses, letters full
of all the rumours thus created were welcomed.&nbsp; But the age
made progress.&nbsp; Newspapers were established in all the
leading towns of the country, and the need of the letter-writer
vanished, but only for a while.&nbsp; In his desire to cater for
the public, and to outbid his competitors, the country newspaper
revived the London correspondent, but on an extended scale.&nbsp;
Now scarce a country newspaper exists that does not avail itself
of his services.</p>
<p>But from the general let me descend to the particular.&nbsp; I
take up the &ldquo;Little Pedlington <!-- page 72--><a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>Gazette,&rdquo; and I find our London Correspondent
dates from --- Club, St. James&rsquo;s-square.&nbsp; Of course,
in a free country, a man may date his letters where he likes; but
I&rsquo;ll be bound to say the letter is written in a cheap
coffee-house in Chancery-lane, and all its contents are culled
from that day&rsquo;s papers.&nbsp; From the letter, however, I
am led to suppose that the writer is a member of the House of
Commons&mdash;that he has the run of the clubs&mdash;that royal
personages are not unfamiliar with him&mdash;and that his
intimacy with Lord Derby and Mr. Disraeli is only equalled by his
friendship with Palmerston and Russell.&nbsp; Our London
Correspondent has very wonderful eyes, and I am sure his ears
must be longer than those of any other animal extant.&nbsp; I
have tried the Strangers&rsquo; Gallery in the House of Commons,
and the Speaker&rsquo;s, and the Reporters&rsquo;, and in all I
have the utmost difficulty in distinguishing emotions which an
animated debate must excite in the disputants.&nbsp; The
Parliamentary fashion is for a minister, when attacked, to sit
with his hat so pulled down over his eyes that you can scarce see
a feature.&nbsp; Lord John always sits in this way, so does Lord
Palmerston.&nbsp; Our London Correspondent can see what no one
else can, and there <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>is not a wince of the galled jade but
what is visible to his eyes.&nbsp; He sees Palmerston winking to
Sir George Grey, and hears what Cornewall Lewis whispers to
Lowe.&nbsp; Lord John does not chuckle quietly to himself, nor
Disraeli whisper a sarcasm, nor Walpole meditate a joke, but he
hears it.&nbsp; He possesses a rare and blessed gift of
ubiquity.&nbsp; At the very time that he is watching these
exalted personages in the House, he is chatting confidentially
with Hayter in the lobby, or looking in at the Opera, or
gossiping behind the scenes with Wright and Paul Bedford, or
having a chop at the Garrick with Thackeray, or shining at Lady
Plantagenet&rsquo;s soir&eacute;e &ldquo;as a bright particular
star.&rdquo;&nbsp; I wonder the dear creature&rsquo;s head is not
quite turned with the attentions he receives from the nobility,
with whom he is as intimate as I with Smiths and Browns.&nbsp;
Occasionally I meet with a few London Correspondents imbibing
together their frugal half-and-half.&nbsp; It does me good to
hear them.&nbsp; It reminds me of Elia&rsquo;s Captain
Jackson&rsquo;s bacchanalian orgies, where &ldquo;wine we had
none, nor, except on very rare occasions, spirits; but the
sensation of wine was there.&rdquo;&nbsp; Says one to another,
&ldquo;Oh, how did you get on last night?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pretty well,&rdquo; is the <!-- page 74--><a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>reply,
&ldquo;considering there were none but lords there.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Walking in a low neighbourhood, I meet one.&nbsp; I ask after his
health.&nbsp; &ldquo;Devilish seedy,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;up
too late last night at Lady ---,&rdquo; naming one of the
proudest members of the proudest aristocracies in the
world.&nbsp; Yet are they too uncultivated, and hairy, and
<i>outr&eacute;</i>, to pass with credit in Belgravia.&nbsp;
Their literary efforts are not remarkable for polish.&nbsp; They
affect a graphic style, and are not sparing in the use of
slang.&nbsp; They eschew the classics, and evince but a very
superficial knowledge of literature, save that of the current
year.&nbsp; They are chiefly strong in politics, and for the
actors on that stage have that contempt which familiarity is said
to breed, but which, as in the present case, sometimes flourishes
without it.&nbsp; They view the busy scene as the gods of
Epicurus the follies of mankind.&nbsp; This man is a
fool&mdash;that a tool.&nbsp; As a rule, officials are run down,
and some illustrious-obscure&mdash;perhaps the borough
representative, if he is on good terms with the paper&mdash;is
suspiciously and inordinately puffed up.&nbsp; I often wish our
London Correspondent would address the House.&nbsp; What a figure
he would make on some matter of business, the details <!-- page
75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>of
which it is impossible to make interesting!&nbsp; The chances are
that he is a Scotchman or an Irishman; that his impudence is
merely confined to paper; that he does not shine either at the
Temple Forum or Codgers&rsquo; Hall.&nbsp; There would be a burst
of laughter when he rose.&nbsp; They ought to be more genial
critics.&nbsp; I was once in the lobby when our London
Correspondent of a paper published in a large manufacturing town
came up to me.&nbsp; I had not seen him for some years.&nbsp;
After the usual inquiries, said he, &ldquo;What a capital cutting
that was in the --- of your book!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are
mistaken,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;the book was by so and
so.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our friend, very crest-fallen, immediately
rushed off without bidding us goodbye.&nbsp; Once upon a time one
of them produced a great sensation.&nbsp; Our readers will
remember, when Lord John Russell dismissed Lord Palmerston, what
a cry was raised about German influences by a certain morning
print which seems to exist merely for the sake of disgusting
intelligent people with a righteous cause.&nbsp; A German paper
was referred to.&nbsp; Well, the gentleman to whom I have alluded
was the correspondent of that paper, and one day, in the absence
of anything of importance, he had manufactured the <!-- page
76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>article very innocently out of the extraordinary
paragraphs in which the morning print aforesaid rejoices, little
dreaming, that in Parliament and out his letter would be quoted
as evidence of a deeply-laid conspiracy to weaken the power of
Lord Palmerston and undermine European liberty.</p>
<p>But I have not yet said who our London Correspondent is.&nbsp;
The better class of them I think are Parliamentary
reporters.&nbsp; There was a paper published in London kept alive
merely by its Paris Correspondent.&nbsp; No other paper had such
a correspondent, or abounded in such extraordinary tales and
scandal.&nbsp; Yet the correspondent&rsquo;s plan was very
simple.&nbsp; Every new tale and drama which came out in Paris
was worked up and sent to London as a reality, that was
all.&nbsp; In a less degree our London Correspondent does the
same, and in quiet country towns there is great wonder and
lifting up of hands, especially if, as was once the case, the
wrong letter is sent, and the Tory paper abounds with sneers at
Lord Derby and the squirearchy, a <i>contretemps</i> which is
avoided if the plan of one London Correspondent be adopted, who
supplies thirteen different papers with the same letter at five
shillings <!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>each&mdash;a plan, however, not
sanctioned by respectable papers, who pay a good price and get
often a good article, and for whose letters, if a little too
highly coloured and seasoned, the public taste is more to blame
than the newspaper proprietor, or his painstaking London
Correspondent.&nbsp; I believe <i>the</i> Mr. Russell, of the
<i>Times</i>, was the London Correspondent of one of the Irish
papers, and such papers as the <i>Liverpool Albion</i>,
<i>Cambridge Independent</i>, and a few others I could name,
evidently have for London Correspondents literary men of superior
position and respectability.</p>
<h2><!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>A SUNDAY AT THE OBELISK.</h2>
<p>The ancient Athenians were a restless, inquisitive
people.&nbsp; At the Areopagus it was that Paul preached of an
unknown God.&nbsp; Their popular assemblies met on the
Pynx.&nbsp; There mob orators decreed the ostracism of Aristides
the Just, and the death of Socrates the Good.&nbsp; In the
metropolis we have no Pynx where our <i>demoi</i> are wont to
assemble, but we have several spots that serve for popular
gatherings on the Sunday&mdash;our working-man&rsquo;s
holiday.&nbsp; One of these is the Obelisk at the Surrey end of
the Blackfriars-road.&nbsp; The district I allude to is what is
called a low neighbourhood.&nbsp; If I am to believe a popular
poet, it was there that the Ratcatcher&rsquo;s daughter lived;
and I should imagine, from the seedy, poverty-struck appearance
of the place, that her papa&rsquo;s avocation was not so highly
remunerative as some other professions, or he would have pitched
his tent, <i>alias</i> become a ten-pound householder, in a more
fashionable quarter.</p>
<p><!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>May I attempt a description of the neighbourhood?&nbsp;
Circumstances compelled me to be there one Sunday, just as
Sabbath bells were ringing for divine service, and the streets
were crowded with hungering worshippers.&nbsp; Newman
Hall&rsquo;s place of worship was full, as was St. John&rsquo;s
Episcopal Chapel, and there was between them a Methodist
Assembly, which was by no means scanty; yet all round me there
were crowds to whom Sunday was no Sunday in a religious sense, to
whom it was a mere day of animal rest, who were yet pale and
heavy with the previous night&rsquo;s gin and beer.&nbsp; What
were they about?&nbsp; Well, from the Surrey Theatre, all
placarded with yellow bills of &ldquo;The Wife&rsquo;s
Revenge,&rdquo; to the Elephant and Castle, there was a busy
traffic going on, far busier, I should imagine, than on any other
morning of the week.&nbsp; Happily the public-houses were shut
up, but as I passed the coffee-houses were full of working-men
reading newspapers, and an easy shaving shop (I write so from the
placard on the door, not from actual experience) seemed doing a
tremendous trade.&nbsp; Such shops as were open, and they were
numerous, were very full, and opposite such as were shut up, what
rows of barrows and costermongers&rsquo; <!-- page 80--><a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>carts there
were, with all the luxuries of the season, such as Spanish
onions, carrots, cabbages, apples and pears, chestnuts,
sweetmeats!&nbsp; Did you want your likeness taken, there were
artists to do it at sixpence a head.&nbsp; Did you need to buy
old clothes, there were Hebrew maidens waiting to sell you them
to any amount.&nbsp; One old lady was doing a thriving business
in what she denominated as &ldquo;spiced elder.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Boot-cleaning, though not by Lord Shaftesbury&rsquo;s boys, was
being carried on upon a gigantic scale.&nbsp; Two or three
vendors of cheap prints, chiefly fancy subjects&mdash;portraits
of imaginary females with very red cheeks and large eyes, and gay
dresses&mdash;collected a great crowd, but I fear one consisting
chiefly of admirers rather than purchasers.&nbsp; It may be that
the tightness of the money market was felt in the
Blackfriars-road, and that the lieges of that district felt that,
with the Bank charging even two-and-a-half per cent., something
better might be done with the money than investing it in works of
art.&nbsp; The butchers&rsquo; stalls were well attended, though
I regret to say, from casual remarks dropped as I passed by, the
keepers of rival establishments were not on such friendly terms
as are desirable amongst near <!-- page 81--><a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>neighbours.&nbsp; Women were bringing their
husbands&rsquo; dinners, children were flocking about in shoals,
and sots were yawning, and smoking, and gossiping, waiting for
one o&rsquo;clock and their beer.&nbsp; You ask, was no effort
made to get this mass under the influence of religious
teaching?&nbsp; Oh, yes; all the morning there was service of
some kind of other at the Obelisk.&nbsp; As soon as one man had
finished, another had commenced; and at times one man was
preaching on one side and another on another.&nbsp; The first man
I heard evidently was a working-man; and if to preach all that is
required were fluency and a loud voice, evidently he would have
done an immense amount of good: but he was too fluent to be clear
and correct.&nbsp; I question whether a working-man is a good
preacher to a working-man.&nbsp; The chances are, he imitates the
worst characteristics of some favourite preacher, instead of
translating Bible truth into plain every-day language.&nbsp; My
friend had got all the stereotyped phrases, such as the
&ldquo;natural man,&rdquo; &amp;c., which can only be understood
by persons accustomed to religious society, and therefore I did
not wonder when I found he had but some twenty or thirty to hear
him.&nbsp; To him succeeded, I regret <!-- page 82--><a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>to say, two
men in seedy black, with dirty white chokers, and cadaverous
faces, whose portraits were I to give, you would tell me I was
drawing a caricature.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t doubt but what they
were most respectable, well-meaning men; but I do think it is a
mistake to send such out into the highways and byways.&nbsp; The
men who go there should be of an engaging aspect, as in the crowd
that pass by you may depend upon it there are but too many
disposed to sneer at and ridicule religion even when it is placed
before them in the most attractive form.&nbsp; How they got on I
cannot tell, as just at that time a host of men very earnest in
discussion attracted my attention.&nbsp; A teetotaller was hard
at work, not repeating a set of phrases parrot-like which he had
learnt by heart, but discussing teetotalism with a crowd
evidently well ready to go into the whole subject.&nbsp; Short
and sharp question and answer were flying fast, and all seemed
very good tempered.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether my friend
succeeded in getting any to sign the pledge, but I could see that
he had more success than the preachers, who seemed to me to make
no impression whatever.&nbsp; We may depend upon it these
discussions are better than speeches or lectures; they require,
perhaps, greater gifts, but <!-- page 83--><a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>they will be
found to yield a richer harvest.&nbsp; It is in the streets we
find the victims, and in the streets we must seek to save
them.&nbsp; You would not get these loungers round the Obelisk to
take the trouble to come to a temperance lecture, but they, well
fortified in their prejudices as established truths, were not
unwilling to engage in a discussion in which they found
themselves worsted.&nbsp; The temperance orator had an advantage
over the divine.&nbsp; The latter could only speak of a future
joy or sorrow, the former could tell the sot how much better he
would have been, how much fresher he would have felt, how much
more money he would have had in his pocket, if he had kept sober
last night; and there stood the sot, all dirty and stupid, yet
repentant, and half influenced by the orator to become a sober
man himself.&nbsp; Such teaching is good in such places; but the
speakers must be prepared to rough it&mdash;to give and take, to
be ready in repartee, to be abundant in anecdote and
illustration.&nbsp; They must have pliant tongues and good
voices, or they may find their congregation moving off to listen
to a social orator over the way; or, what is worse still,
remaining to confute, and jeer, and laugh.</p>

84</span>EXETER HALL.</h2>
<p>Lord Macaulay has made all the world familiar with the bray of
Exeter Hall.&nbsp; Exeter Hall, when it does bray, does so to
some purpose.&nbsp; It is in vain fighting Exeter Hall.&nbsp; It
is the parliament of the middle classes.&nbsp; It has an
influence for good or bad no legislator can overlook&mdash;to
which often the assembly in St. Stephen&rsquo;s is compelled to
bow.&nbsp; I have seen a Prince Consort presiding at a public
meeting in Exeter Hall; on its platform I have heard our greatest
orators and statesmen declaim.&nbsp; In England who can over
estimate the influence of woman? and in Exeter Hall, in the
season, nine benches out of ten are filled with women.&nbsp; The
oratory of Exeter Hall is not parliamentary.&nbsp; A man may
shine before a legal tribunal&mdash;may shine on the floor of the
House of Commons&mdash;may be great among the Lords&mdash;and yet
utterly fail in Exeter Hall.&nbsp; He may even be a popular
preacher, and yet not move the masses that crowd the Strand, when
a public <!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>meeting, chiefly religious,
occasionally philanthropic, never political, is being held.</p>
<p>On your right-hand side, as you pass along the Strand, you see
a lofty door, evidently leading to some immense building
within.&nbsp; It is called Exeter Hall, for it stands where in
old times stood Exeter Change, and still has its live lions,
which are very numerous, especially in the months of May and
June.&nbsp; You enter the door and ascend a long and ample
staircase, which conducts you to one of the finest public rooms
in the metropolis.&nbsp; What popular passions have I not seen
here!&nbsp; What contradictory utterances have I not heard
here!&nbsp; High Church&mdash;Low
Church&mdash;Methodism&mdash;Dissent&mdash;have all appealed from
that platform to those benches crowded with living souls.&nbsp;
From that platform, accompanying that organ, seven hundred voices
join often in Handel&rsquo;s majestic strains.&nbsp; Underneath
me are the offices of the various societies whose aims are among
the noblest that can be proposed to man.&nbsp; Westminster Hall
is a fine hall, but this in which I am is eight feet wider than
that&mdash;131 feet long, 76 feet wide, and 45 feet high, and
will contain with comfort more than 3,000 persons.&nbsp; On the
night of which I now write it was well <!-- page 86--><a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>filled by an
audience, such as a few years back could not have been collected
for love or money, but which now can be got together with the
greatest ease, not merely in London, but in Manchester, in
Birmingham, in Liverpool, in all our great seats of industry, of
intelligence, and life.&nbsp; I mean an audience of men and women
who have come to see intemperance to be the great curse of this
our age and land, and who have resolved to abstain themselves
from all intoxicating drink, and to encourage others to do so as
well.&nbsp; Evidently something great was expected.&nbsp; The
western gallery was covered with tastefully-decorated cloth, on
which was inscribed, in emblazoned silver letters, thirty inches
deep, &ldquo;The London Temperance League,&rdquo; with an
elaborate painted border, composed of garlands of flowers.&nbsp;
The royal gallery, and the smaller one opposite, was covered with
scarlet cloth, on which were arranged rose-coloured panels, with
the words, &ldquo;London Temperance League,&rdquo; in silver
letters.&nbsp; The front of the platform and the reporters&rsquo;
box was also decorated in a similar manner.&nbsp; At the end of
the royal gallery was fixed a large royal standard, the folds of
which hung gracefully over the heads of the audience.&nbsp; <!--
page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>Under the royal standard was placed the
union-jack.&nbsp; At the end of the opposite gallery proudly
waved the banner of the great Republic of the West.&nbsp; The
platform was decorated with flags, bearing inscriptions of
various kinds.&nbsp; Like the stars in the heavens, or the sands
on the sea shore, they were innumerable.&nbsp; In front of the
organ were arranged the choir of the Temperance Societies, and on
the floor of the platform were placed the Shapcott family, with
their Sax-horns.</p>
<p>Why was all this preparation made?&nbsp; For what purpose that
living multitude of warm hearts?&nbsp; The answer is soon
given.&nbsp; Some twenty-four years back a poor lad, without
money and learning&mdash;almost without friends&mdash;was shipped
off to America, to try his fortune in the New World.&nbsp;
Arrived there, the lad became a man, lived by the sweat of his
brow, learned to drink, to be a boon companion, and fell as most
fall; for there is that in the flowing bowl and the wine when it
is red, which few can withstand.&nbsp; Friends left him; he
became an outcast and a wanderer; he sank lower and lower; he
walked in rags; he loathed life; his frame became emaciated with
disease; there was none to pity or to save.&nbsp; It seemed for
that man there was <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>nothing left but to lie down and
die.&nbsp; However, whilst there is life there is hope.&nbsp;
That man, in his degradation and despair, was reached; he signed
the Temperance pledge; he became an advocate of the Temperance
cause.&nbsp; His words were words of power; they touched
men&rsquo;s hearts, they fired men&rsquo;s souls.&nbsp; He led
the life of an apostle; wherever he went the drunkard was
reclaimed; zeal was excited, the spell of the sparkling cup was
gone, humanity was saved, and now he had returned for awhile to
his native land to advocate the cause which had been a salvation
to his own soul and life, and these men and women&mdash;these
hopeful youths&mdash;these tender-hearted maidens&mdash;have come
to give him welcome.&nbsp; Already every eye in that vast
assembly is turned to the quarter whence it is expected the hero
of the night will appear.&nbsp; At length the appointed hour
arrives, a band of Temperance reformers move towards the
platform, with the flags of Britain and America waving, as we
trust they may long do, harmoniously together.&nbsp; Familiar
faces are seen&mdash;Cruikshank&mdash;Buckingham&mdash;Cassell;
but there is one form, apparently a stranger; it is John B.
Gough.&nbsp; A few words from Mr. Buckingham, who presides, and
the <!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>stranger comes forward; but he is no stranger, for the
British greeting, that almost deafens his ears, while it opens
his heart, makes him feel himself at once at home.</p>
<p>Well, popular enthusiasm has toned down&mdash;the audience has
reseated itself&mdash;a song of welcome has been sung, and there
stands up a man of middle size and middle age.&nbsp; Lord Bacon
deemed himself ancient when he was thirty-one&mdash;we moderns,
in our excessive self-love, delude each other into the belief
that we are middle-aged when we are anywhere between forty and
sixty.&nbsp; In reality, a middle-aged man should be somewhere
about thirty-five, and such we take to be Mr. Gough&rsquo;s
age.&nbsp; He is dressed in sober black&mdash;his hair is dark,
and so is his face; but there is a muscular vigour in his frame
for which we were not prepared.&nbsp; We should judge Gough has a
large share of the true <i>elixir vit&aelig;</i>&mdash;animal
spirits.&nbsp; His voice is one of great power and pathos, and he
speaks without an effort.&nbsp; The first sentence, as it falls
gently and easily from his lips, tells us that Gough has that
true oratorical power which neither money, nor industry, nor
persevering study, can ever win.&nbsp; Like the poet, the orator
must be born.&nbsp; You may take a <!-- page 90--><a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>man six feet
high; he shall be good-looking, have a good voice, and speak
English with a correct pronunciation&mdash;you shall write for
that man a splendid speech&mdash;you shall have him taught
elocution by Mr. Webster, and yet you shall no more make that man
an orator than, to use a homely phrase, you can make a silk purse
out of a sow&rsquo;s ear.&nbsp; Gough is an orator born.&nbsp;
Pope tells us he &ldquo;lisped in numbers,&rdquo; and in his
boyhood Gough must have had the true tones of the orator on his
tongue.&nbsp; There was no effort&mdash;no fluster&mdash;all was
easy and natural.&nbsp; He was speaking for the first time to a
public meeting in his native land&mdash;speaking to thousands who
had come with the highest expectations&mdash;who expected much
and required much&mdash;speaking, by means of the press, to the
whole British public.&nbsp; Under such circumstances, occasional
nervousness would have been pardonable; but, from the first,
Gough was perfectly self-possessed.&nbsp; There are some men who
have prodigious advantages on account of appearance alone.&nbsp;
We think it was Fox who said it was impossible for any one to be
as wise as Thurlow looked.&nbsp; The great Lord Chatham was
particularly favoured by nature in this respect.&nbsp; In our own
time&mdash;in the case of Lord Denman&mdash;we <!-- page 91--><a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>have seen how
much can be done by means of a portly presence and a stately
air.&nbsp; Gough has nothing of this.&nbsp; He is just as plain a
personage as George Dawson of Birmingham would be if he were to
cut his hair and shave off his moustache; but, though we have
named George Dawson, Gough does not speak like him, or any other
living man.&nbsp; Gough is no servile copy, but a real
original.&nbsp; We have no one in England we can compare him
to.&nbsp; Our popular lecturers, such as George Dawson, Henry
Vincent, George Thompson, are very different men.&nbsp; They have
all a studied quaintness or a studied rhetoric.&nbsp; There is
something artificial about them all.&nbsp; In Gough there is
nothing of this.&nbsp; He seems to speak by inspiration.&nbsp; As
the apostles spoke who were commanded not to think beforehand
what they should say&mdash;the spoken word seems to come
naturally, as air bubbles up from the bottom of the well.&nbsp;
In what he said there was nothing new&mdash;there could be
nothing new&mdash;the tale he told was old as the hills; yet, as
he spoke, an immense audience grew hushed and still, and hearts
were melted, and tears glistened in female eyes, and that great
human mass became knit together by a common spell.&nbsp; Disraeli
says, Sir Robert Peel played upon the House of <!-- page 92--><a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>Commons as an
old fiddle; Gough did the same at Exeter Hall.&nbsp; At his
bidding, stern, strong men, as well as sensitive women, wept or
laughed&mdash;they swelled with indignation or desire.&nbsp; Of
the various chords of human passions he was master.&nbsp; At
times he became roused, and we thought how</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;In
his ire Olympian Pericles<br />
Thundered and lightened, and all Hellas shook.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At other times, in his delineation of American manners, he
proved himself almost an equal to Selsbee.&nbsp; Off the stage we
have nowhere seen a better mimic than Gough, and this must give
him great power, especially in circles where the stage is as much
a <i>terra incognita</i> as Utopia, or the Island of Laputa
itself.&nbsp; We have always thought that a fine figure of Byron,
where he tells us that he laid his hand upon the ocean&rsquo;s
mane.&nbsp; Something of the same kind might be said to be
applicable to Mr. Gough.&nbsp; He seemed to ride upon the
audience&mdash;to have mastered it completely to his will.&nbsp;
He seemed to bestride it as we could imagine Alexander bestriding
his Bucephalus.&nbsp; Since then Mr. Gough has spoken in Exeter
Hall nearly seventy times&mdash;has endured cruel
misrepresentations&mdash;<!-- page 93--><a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>yet his
attractions are as great, and his audiences as overflowing as
over.&nbsp; The truth is, in his strength and weakness Gough is
the very personification of an Exeter Hall orator.&nbsp; You may
object to his exaggerations&mdash;you may find fault with his
digressions&mdash;you may pooh-pooh his arguments&mdash;you may
question the good taste of some of his allusions&mdash;you may
wonder how people can applaud, and laugh at, or weep over, what
they have applauded, or laughed at, or wept over a dozen times
before: but they do; that no one can deny.</p>
<p>Gough spoke for nearly two hours.&nbsp; Evidently the audience
could have listened, had he gone on, till midnight.&nbsp; We
often hear that the age of oratory has gone by&mdash;that the
press supersedes the tongue&mdash;that the appeal must henceforth
be made to the reader in his study, not to the hearer in the
crowded hall.&nbsp; There is much truth in that.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, the true orator will always please his audience,
and true oratory will never die.&nbsp; The world will always
respond to it.&nbsp; The human heart will always leap up to
it.&nbsp; The finest efforts of the orator have been amongst
civilised audiences.&nbsp; It was a cultivated audience before
whom Demosthenes pleaded; to whom, <!-- page 94--><a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>standing on
Mars-hill, Paul preached of an unknown God.&nbsp; The true
orator, like the true poet, speaks to all.&nbsp; He gathers
around him earth&rsquo;s proudest as well as poorest
intellects.&nbsp; Notwithstanding, then, the march of mind,
oratory may win her triumphs still.&nbsp; So long as the heart is
true to its old instinct&mdash;so long as it can pity, or love,
or hate, or fear, it will be moved by the orator, if he can but
pity or love, or hate or fear himself.&nbsp; This is the true
secret.&nbsp; This is it that made Gough the giant that he
is.&nbsp; Without that he might be polished, learned, master of
all human lore; but he would be feeble and impotent as the</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Lorn

<p>Is there a finer sight in creation than a horse?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t speak of the wild horse of the prairie, as seen at
Astley&rsquo;s&mdash;nor of the wearied animal by means of which
the enterprising greengrocer transports his wares from
Covent-Garden to the Edgware-road&mdash;nor of the useful but
commonplace looking cob on which Jones trusts himself timidly as
he ventures on a constitutional ride, while his groom, much
better mounted, follows scornfully behind&mdash;nor of the
broken-down, broken-knee&rsquo;d, spavined, blind roarer, all the
summer of whose life has been passed in dreary drudgery, and for
whom nought remains but the knacker&rsquo;s yard, and the cold
calculations of the itinerant vendors of cat&rsquo;s-meat; but of
a horse such as a monarch might pet, and the very queen of beauty
might deign to ride&mdash;a horse such as Gamarra.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;A noble
steed,<br />
Strong, black, and of the desert breed,<br />
Full of fire and full of bone,<br />
All his line of fathers known,<br />
Fine his nose, his nostrils thin,<br />
But blown abroad by the pride within.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>And who that has ever laid his leg across such, and
bounded along the turf, does not feel that the bare memory of it
is a joy for ever, thrilling almost as Love&rsquo;s young
dream?&nbsp; Such was our good fortune once; now we creep into
town on the top of a &rsquo;bus, and our hair is grey, and our
pluck is gone, and our heart no larger than a pin&rsquo;s
head.</p>
<p>To write about London, and to omit all mention of the Derby,
were unpardonable.&nbsp; At the Royal Academy Exhibition this
year, the rush to see Mr. Frith&rsquo;s picture of the Derby was
so great that a policeman was required to keep off the
crowd.&nbsp; Horse-racing is the natural result of
horse-riding.&nbsp; It is essentially the English sport.&nbsp;
Taking Wetherby&rsquo;s Calendar as our guide, we may calculate
that in 1855 there were 144 meetings in Great Britain and
Ireland, which were attended by 1606 horses, of whom only 680
were winners, fed by &pound;60,000 of added money inclusive of
the value of cups and whips, and diffusing &pound;198,000 in
added money and stakes more or less.&nbsp; If there were no light
weights to ride, and no noblemen or wealthy commoners to run
their horses, the horses would run of their own accord.&nbsp;
There are horses, as there are men, who never <!-- page 97--><a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>will play
second fiddle if they can possibly avoid it; and if horses run,
men will look and admire, and the natural result is the Derby
Day.&nbsp; A grander sight of its kind is perhaps hardly to be
seen.&nbsp; For twelve months have the public been preparing for
the event.&nbsp; For twelve months has the sporting and the
betting world been on the <i>qui vive</i>.&nbsp; We do not bet,
for we hold that the custom is absurd in a rich man, and wicked
in one who is not so; but in every street in London, in every
town in England, in many a quiet village, at the beer-shop, or
the gin-palace, or the public-house, bets have been made, and
thousands and thousands of pounds are depending on the
event.&nbsp; As the time draws nigh the excitement
increases.&nbsp; Had you looked in at Tattersall&rsquo;s on the
previous Sunday, you would have seen the betting of our West End
swells and M.P.&rsquo;s who legislate for the observance of the
Sabbath, and who punish poor men for keeping
betting-houses&mdash;fast and furious.&nbsp; On the previous
night of the day when the Derby is run a motley population encamp
on the Downs.&nbsp; There are booths where there are to be
dancing, and drinking, and eating, and gambling.&nbsp; There are
gipsies who are to tell fortunes, and acrobats who are to exhibit
<!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>a most astonishing flexibility of muscle.&nbsp; There
are organs, and singing girls, and a whole legion of scamps, who
will pick pockets, or play French put, or toss you for a bottle
of stout, or offer their book and a pencil to betters; and as the
dim grey of morning brightens into day, their number increases in
a most marvellous manner.&nbsp; On they come&mdash;ricketty carts
laden with ginger beer&mdash;men with long barrows and short
pipes, who have walked all the way from town, long trains of gigs
and hansoms, and drags, and carriages, and &rsquo;busses, and
pleasure vans, laden with pleasure seekers, determined to have a
holiday.&nbsp; The trains bring down some thirty or forty
thousand human souls, the road is blocked up and almost
impassable.&nbsp; Many a party, who left town in good spirits,
have come to grief.&nbsp; Here a wheel has come off.&nbsp; There
the springs have broken.&nbsp; Here the dumb brute has refused to
drag his heavy burden any further.&nbsp; There the team have been
restive or the charioteer unskilful, and the coach has been
upset.&nbsp; In a session in which unusually little business has
been done, in the very midst of a ministerial crisis, parliament
has adjourned, and senators, commoners, and lords, are everywhere
around.&nbsp; That man with spectacles and long black stock,
driving <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>a younger son past us, is
England&rsquo;s premier, whose horse is the favourite&mdash;who
has never yet won the Derby&mdash;who, it is said, would rather
do so than have a parliamentary success&mdash;and who, it is also
said, has offered his jockey &pound;50 a-year for life should he
win this race.&nbsp; That fat, greyhaired man is the Duke of
Malakoff.&nbsp; Here is the Royal Duke, who is treading in his
father&rsquo;s steps, and will be wept by a future generation as
the good duke and hero of a thousand City feeds.&nbsp; Let us
look about us while the bell is ringing and the police are
clearing the course.&nbsp; The Grand Stand alone holds some
thousands.&nbsp; Then, as you look from it for a mile on each
side, what a cluster of human heads! and behind, what an array of
carriages and vehicles of all kinds!&nbsp; A most furious attack
is evidently being made on the commissariat.&nbsp; The more
dashing have baskets, labelled &ldquo;Fortnum and Mason,&rdquo;
and it is clear that the liquids are stronger than tea.&nbsp; Be
thankful those are not ladies, dressed elegantly though they be,
who have drank so much champagne that their tongues are going
rather faster than is necessary.&nbsp; You do not see many
ladies; and the girls so gay, what is their gaiety?&mdash;is it
truer than their complexions?&nbsp; Very beautiful at a distance,
<!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>if you do not go close and see the rouge and pearl
powder.&nbsp; But to-day is a holiday.&nbsp; Many here know
nothing about a horse, care little about one; but they have come
out for a day&rsquo;s fresh air and for a pic-nic.&nbsp; They
could not have had a finer day or chosen a better spot.&nbsp; The
down itself, with its fresh green velvet turf, is delicious to
tread: and as you look around, what a magnificent panorama meets
your eye, fringed by waving woods and chestnut trees, heavy with
their annual bloom!&nbsp; Then there are the horses taking their
preliminary canter.&nbsp; What eager eyes are on them!&nbsp; How
anxious are the betters now, making up their final books!&nbsp;
At the corner, in the carriages, on the hill, or along the
course, how brisk is the speculation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Which is
Tox?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is that Physician?&rdquo; &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
Beadsman?&rdquo; are the questions in every mouth.&nbsp; And one
does not like this horse&rsquo;s fore legs, or that horse&rsquo;s
hind ones.&nbsp; And criticisms of all kinds are hazarded.&nbsp;
At length some twenty horses are got together at the post.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re off!&rdquo; is the cry wafted across the
plain.&nbsp; Up the hill they go.&nbsp; On the top they&rsquo;re
scarce visible.&nbsp; As they turn the corner they look like so
many rats.&nbsp; <!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>And now, amidst a whirlwind of
shouting and hurrahing, the race is over; and in two minutes and
fifty-four seconds Sir Joseph Hawley, a Whig baronet, beats Lord
Derby, the Conservative Premier, clears &pound;50,000, while his
jockey, for that short ride, earns as much as you or me, my good
sir, may win by the labour of many a long year.&nbsp; Pigeons fly
off with the result.&nbsp; The telegraph is at work.&nbsp; At the
<i>Sunday Times</i> office, about four o&rsquo;clock, the crowd
is so great that you can scarce get along the street, and many a
man goes home with a heavy heart, for some are hit very
hard.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is a bad day for all of us,&rdquo; says
one to me, with a very long face.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have lost
&pound;150,&rdquo; says another, and he does not look like a man
who could afford to lose that sum, and the crowd
disperses&mdash;some exultant&mdash;some despairing&mdash;all of
them in a reckless mood, and ready for dissipation.&nbsp; The
longer we stop now, the sadder shall we become.&nbsp; Go to
Kennington-common, if you wish to see the moral effects of the
Derby.&nbsp; Drop in at the places of gay resort at the West-end
in the course of the night.&nbsp; Go in a little while after to
Bow-street, or Portugal-street.&nbsp; For many a day will
families mourn a <!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>visit to the Derby.&nbsp; I never
saw so many wives, evidently belonging to decent tradesmen, so
intoxicated as I saw on the last Derby.&nbsp; In the train but
little intoxication was visible, but the coming home was the dark
side&mdash;a side which the admirers of what they call our
national sports are too ready to overlook, and which even Mr.
Frith has failed to paint.</p>
<p>The eloquent Montalembert sees in a Derby day what Virgil has
described in the fifth &AElig;neid.&nbsp; The Frenchman is too
complimentary, it is true.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Undique conveniunt Teucri mixtique
Sicani.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But pious &AElig;neas sanctioned no such reckless revelry as
too often is visible on the Epsom downs.&nbsp; Lord Palmerston
compares the Derby to the Isthmian games; but as they were
celebrated once in ten years, and were in honour of Neptune, the
resemblance is not very clear.&nbsp; Pulteney, a statesman, in
his day as eminent as the illustrious M.P. for Tiverton,
published in the &ldquo;World&rdquo; a sketch of Newmarket; but
the expense and waste of time of such places seemed to him
perfectly frightful.&nbsp; It is well that his <!-- page 103--><a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>lordship
has been defunct this hundred and fifty years.&nbsp; A horse race
then was a much more sober affair than in these enlightened
days&mdash;when every head is full and every tongue vocal with
mental and moral reform.</p>
<h2><!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>VAUXHALL GARDENS.</h2>
<p>Vauxhall is alive.&nbsp; At one time it was thought dead, and
people affirmed the fact to be an evidence of the improved state
of the metropolis.&nbsp; (Moralists are too prone to be thankful
for small mercies.)&nbsp; Had the fact been so, the inference was
a fallacy; but we need not trouble ourselves about that, as the
fact is otherwise.&nbsp; It is a mistake to suppose that progress
is made only in one direction.&nbsp; Vauxhall is associated with
the fast life of centuries.&nbsp; It was born in the general and
fearful profligacy&mdash;the fearful price England paid for the
Restoration.&nbsp; In 1661 Evelyn writes of it as a pretty
contrived plantation.&nbsp; In 1665, in the diary of Pepys, we
find entries of sundry visits to Fox-hall and the Spring Gardens,
and &ldquo;of the humours of the citizens pulling off cherries,
and God knows what.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again we are told, &ldquo;to
hear the nightingales and the birds, and here fiddlers, and there
a harp, and here laughing, and there the people walking, is
mighty <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>diverting.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
respectable Secretary of the Admiralty also tells us of supper in
an arbour, of ladies walking with their masks on, and his
righteous soul was shocked to see &ldquo;how rude some of the
young gallants of the town are become,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the
confidence of the vice of the age.&rdquo;&nbsp; To Vauxhall
Addison took Sir Roger de Coverley, and Goldsmith the Citizen of
the World, who exclaimed, &ldquo;Head of Confucius, this is fine!
this unites rural beauty with courtly magnificence.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here Fielding&rsquo;s Amelia was enraptured with the extreme
beauty and elegance of the place.&nbsp; Here Miss Burney gathered
incidents for her once popular but now forgotten tales.&nbsp; And
here Hogarth, for suggesting paintings, some of which still
remain, was presented with a perpetual ticket of admission, and
which was last used in 1836.&nbsp; Strange scenes have been done
here.&nbsp; One of them is described by Horace Walpole, who
graphically narrates how Lady Caroline Petersham stewed chickens
over a lamp; and how Betty, the fruit girl, supped with them at a
side table.&nbsp; All that is past.&nbsp; Dust and ashes are the
fine lords and fine ladies who made Vauxhall the resort of folly
and fashion&mdash;the fashion is gone, the folly remains.&nbsp;
Yet never were there <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>more funds subscribed for the
conversion of the Jews, or more missionaries sent out to
Timbuctoo.</p>
<p>Vauxhall is one of the delusions of London life.&nbsp; It
lives on the past&mdash;a very common practice in this country,
where real knowledge travels very slowly.&nbsp; When Smith comes
up to London, his first Sunday he goes to hear the Rev. Mr.
Flummery, thinking he is the popular preacher.&nbsp; Ah, Smith!
Flummery has ceased to be a popular preacher these twenty
years.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a sweet girl is gone!&rdquo; exclaims
old Jones, as he hears of the death of an ancient flame.&nbsp;
Jones forgets the sweet girl had become an old maid of seventy,
and had not a tooth in her mouth or a lock of hair on her head
but what was artificial.&nbsp; So with Vauxhall.&nbsp; It lives
as many a man, or newspaper, or magazine, or institution, on its
name.&nbsp; Judge for yourself if you won&rsquo;t take my
word.&nbsp; A cab will take you there from the Strand in half an
hour, and for the very moderate sum of one shilling the gate will
be unlocked and entrance effected.&nbsp; The specialty of the
place is the blaze of lights from thousands of lamps.&nbsp;
Supposing you to have got over the bewilderment created by their
lustre, to eyes not accustomed to such &ldquo;hall sof dazzling
light,&rdquo; you perceive a <!-- page 107--><a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>kind of
square (the precise definition of it I leave to the
mathematicians) with a dancing platform in the middle, a supper
room on one side, and boxes all round, where refreshments and
seats are supplied.&nbsp; Opposite to the supper-room is a lofty
orchestra, glittering all over with many coloured lamps; further
on and behind are walks, and trees, and a fountain, with gigantic
horses snorting water through their nostrils, and a space for
fireworks, the demand for which on the part of the pleasure
seekers of the metropolis, if we may judge by the supply, is
insatiable.&nbsp; Let us not forget also the Rotunda, a large
building with pit, boxes, and gallery, chiefly devoted to
horsemanship, neither worse nor better than what is usually seen
at such places.&nbsp; The comic singing is a feature of the
place.&nbsp; Popular comic songs are not very fresh, nor very
witty nor refined, and require, when delivered in public, a good
deal of elocution.&nbsp; The point must be apparent, and the
emphasis clearly enunciated, but they are much the same here as
elsewhere.&nbsp; When you have heard one or two of them, you have
heard them all.&nbsp; So much by way of description.&nbsp; The
people who come here are the people whose pleasures are of the
lowest <!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>character; who are dependent on
others; whose life is all outward rather than inward.&nbsp; They
are not readers nor thinkers, you may be sure, but the class
precisely to whom such places are as hurtful as they are
attractive.&nbsp; If a man is to be known by the company he
keeps, what are we to think of the habitu&eacute;s of Vauxhall?
for after all life is, or ought to be, to us all a stern
reality&mdash;a battle-field&mdash;a victory&mdash;not a pleasure
garden, or a Vanity Fair; and even in London you may mix with
better society than that of painted Traviatas or tipsy men.&nbsp;
Smoking, dancing, drinking, is not all life; yet for such
purposes Vauxhall solely exists.&nbsp; I much question, if London
alone were concerned, so great is the rivalry in this particular
style of amusement, whether Vauxhall would be a success; but the
provincial element is amazingly strong.&nbsp; I account for that
as follows.&nbsp; The railway system has done this for
London.&nbsp; It has filled it with strangers.&nbsp; From the
wilds of Connemara, from the distant Land&rsquo;s End and remote
John o&rsquo;Groat&rsquo;s, old and young, male and female, rich
and poor, wise or foolish, come in shoals to see London and its
sights.&nbsp; Now Vauxhall, and its illumination, and its slice
of ham, have been <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>the wonder of generations, and to
Vauxhall away they rush.&nbsp; Their speech betrayeth them.&nbsp;
Look at them.&nbsp; This party is from Lancashire.&nbsp; From the
flowery fields of Somersetshire that party have come.&nbsp; Wales
has sent her exciteable sons, and Scotland her reckless
prodigals, for there are such even ayont the Tweed.&nbsp; Here we
have some five or six&mdash;a father and mother, a daughter and
her husband, and it may be a brother.&nbsp; Those giants were
never reared within the sound of Bow bells, and to be impertinent
to either the old lady or the young one were the height of
folly.&nbsp; Their fashions are not ours, yet are they wondrous
jolly; and, woe is me, the head of the family is exhibiting an
agility as he bounds up and down as an elephant might, which is
unbecoming his years.&nbsp; How is this?&nbsp; Why actually in a
remote corner of the pocket, in the innermost depths of that
ancient coat, there is a bottle of raw gin, which the old satyr
puts to his own mouth, and then hands it to the rest of his
party, by whom, in a similar manner, it is applied, till what is
left would not hurt the conscience of a teetotaller to
drink.&nbsp; It is well his &ldquo;missus&rdquo; is there to
pilot him home, and the sooner he gets back to his Yorkshire
wilds <!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>the better.&nbsp; Yet we have a
sprinkling of town life.&nbsp; The reader must remember Vauxhall
occupies altogether eleven acres of ground, and on one occasion
upwards of 20,000 persons paid for admission.&nbsp; Look at that
faded pair.&nbsp; Some forty years ago they were fast, as times
went, and here they have come to have a peep at the old place,
and to wonder how they cared so much about it then.&nbsp; There
stands an old fogy of the Regency.&nbsp; Of what hideous debauch
can he tell; and here stuffed, and painted, and bewigged, made up
from top to toe, he has come to mourn, not to moralise, over the
past.&nbsp; A sad sight is he; but sadder still are those
pale-faced ones, of elaborate hair, and exquisitely fitting
costumes and bewitching Balmorals, now dancing, now chaffing, now
drinking, now uproariously merry, but all the time with wanton
wiles seeking their human prey in the excitement of music, and
laughter, and wine.</p>
<h2><!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>THE PENNY GAFF.</h2>
<p>Do my readers know Shoreditch?&nbsp; I do not mean the Eastern
Counties Railway Station, but the regions dark and dolorous lying
beyond.&nbsp; In an old map of London, by my side, dated 1560, I
see it marked as a street with but one row of houses on each
side, and the five windmills in Finsbury Fields not far
off.&nbsp; Here stood the Curtain Theatre.&nbsp; In Stowe&rsquo;s
time there were in Shoreditch &ldquo;two publique houses for the
acting and shewe of comedies, tragedies, and histories for
recreation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, according to the learned and
indefatigable Mr. Timbs, &ldquo;at the Blue Last public-house,
porter was first sold, about 1730.&rdquo;&nbsp; And here still,
if I may judge from the immense number of public-houses all
round, the consumption of porter and other intoxicating liquors
is still carried on on a somewhat extensive scale.&nbsp; Hard
working and businesslike as Shoreditch is by day, with its
clothes marts and extensive shoe dep&ocirc;ts, by night it is a
great place for amusement.&nbsp; <!-- page 112--><a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>Here are
theatres where melodrama reigns supreme.&nbsp; Close by is the
renowned Britannia Saloon.&nbsp; And here concerts exist where,
over their beer, the listeners are regaled with the sentimental
and comic songs of a generation long gathered to its
fathers.&nbsp; To me I confess there is somewhat of pathos in
these places.&nbsp; What tales cannot that ancient landlord
tell!&nbsp; The young, the beautiful, the brave he has outlived,
where are they?</p>
<p>But let us pass on to the penny theatre, a place not hard to
find in this region of shell-fish and fruit-pie shops, those sure
indications of a neighbourhood rather poor and very wild.&nbsp;
We pay our money at the door, and then follow the direction given
us by the businesslike young woman who takes the fee,
&ldquo;First turn to the left, and then to the
right.&rdquo;&nbsp; But instead of being allowed to enter at
once, we have to wait with several others, chiefly boys, very
dirty, who regard us apparently with no very favourable eye, till
a fresh house is formed.&nbsp; Our new acquaintances are not
talkative, and we are not sorry when our turn comes to enter the
dirty hole set apart for the entertainment of the Shoreditch
youth.&nbsp; We climb up a primitive staircase, and <!-- page
113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>find ourselves in a gallery of the rudest description,
a privilege for which we have to pay a penny extra.&nbsp; Here we
have an ample view of the stage and the pit, the latter chiefly
filled with boys, very dirty, and full of fun, with the usual
proportion of mothers with excited babies.&nbsp; The performance
commences with a panorama of American scenery, with some very
stale American criticisms, about the man who was so tall that he
had to go up a ladder to shave himself, and so on; all, however,
exciting much mirth amongst the youthful and apple-eating
audience.&nbsp; Then a young lady, with very short petticoats and
very thick ancles, dances, and takes all hearts by storm.&nbsp;
To her succeeds one who sings about true love, but not in a
manner which the Shoreditch youthdom affects.&nbsp; Then a fool
comes upon the stage, and keeps the pit in a roar, especially
when he directs his wit to the three musicians who form the
orchestra, and says ironically to one of them, &ldquo;You could
not drink a quartern of gin, could you?&rdquo; and the way in
which the allusion was received evidently implied that the
enlightened but juvenile audience around me evidently had a very
low opinion of a man who could not toss off his quartern of
gin.&nbsp; Then we had the everlasting <!-- page 114--><a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>niggers,
with the bones, and curiously-wrought long coats, and doubtful
dialect, and perpetual laughter, which the excited pit copiously
rewarded.&nbsp; One boy tossed a button on the stage, another a
copper, and another an apple; and so pleasing was this liberality
to the supposed young men of African descent, that they did not
think it beneath them, or inconsistent with their dignity as
professionals, to encourage it in every possible way.&nbsp; And
well they might.&nbsp; Those gay blacks very likely had little
white faces at home dependent on the liberality of the house for
next day&rsquo;s crust.&nbsp; But the treat of the evening was a
screaming farce, in one act, in which the old tale of
&ldquo;Taming the Shrew&rdquo; was set forth in the most approved
Shoreditch fashion.&nbsp; A husband comes upon the stage, whose
wife&mdash;I would not be ungallant, but conscientious regard to
truth compels me sorrowfully to declare&mdash;is an unmitigated
shrew.&nbsp; She lords it over her husband as no good woman ever
did or wishes to do.&nbsp; The poor man obeys till he can stand
it no longer.&nbsp; At length all his manhood is aroused.&nbsp;
Armed with what he calls a persuader&mdash;a cudgel of most
formidable pretensions&mdash;he astonishes his wife with his
unexpected resistance.&nbsp; She tries to <!-- page 115--><a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>regain the
mastery, but in vain; and great is the delight of all as the
husband, holding his formidable instrument over his cowed and
trembling wife, compels her to obey his every word.&nbsp; All the
unwashed little urchins around me were furious with
delight.&nbsp; There was no need for the husband to tell the
audience, as he did, as the moral of the piece, that the best
remedy for a bad wife was to get such another cudgel for her as
that he held in his hand.&nbsp; It was quite clear the little
Britons around me had resolved how they would act; and I fear, as
they passed out to the number of about 200, few of them did not
resolve, as soon as they had the chance, to drink their quartern
of gin and to whop their wives.</p>
<p>On another occasion it chanced to me to visit a penny gaff in
that dark and dolorous region, the New Cut.&nbsp; There the
company and the entertainment were of a much lower
character.&nbsp; A great part of the proceedings were indecent
and disgusting, yet very satisfactory to the half-grown girls and
boys present.&nbsp; In the time of the earlier Georges we read
much of the brutality of the lower orders.&nbsp; If we may
believe contemporary writers on men and manners, never was <!--
page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>the theatre so full&mdash;never was the audience so
excited&mdash;never did the scum and refuse of the streets so
liberally patronise the entertainment as when deeds of violence
and blood were the order of the night.&nbsp; This old savage
spirit is dying out, but in the New Cut I fear it has not given
way to a better one.</p>
<h2><!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>RAG FAIR.</h2>
<p>People often ask, how do the poor live in London.&nbsp; This a
question I don&rsquo;t intend answering on the present
occasion.&nbsp; But if you ask how they clothe themselves, my
answer is, at Rag Fair.&nbsp; Do my readers remember
Dickens&rsquo;s sketch of Field-lane?&nbsp; In &ldquo;Oliver
Twist,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;Near to the spot at which
Snow-hill and Holborn meet there opens, on the right hand as you
come out of the city, a dark and dismal alley, leading to
Saffron-hill.&nbsp; In its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge
bunches of pocket handkerchiefs of all sizes and patterns, for
here reside the traders who purchase them from pickpockets;
hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside
the windows, or flaunting from the door-posts, and the shelves
within are filled with them.&nbsp; Confined as the limits of
Field-lane are, it has its barber, its coffee-shop, its
beer-shop, and its fried fish warehouse.&nbsp; It is a commercial
colony of itself&mdash;the emporium of petty <!-- page 118--><a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>larceny,
visited at early morning and setting in of dusk by silent
merchants, who traffic in dark back parlours, and go as strangely
as they come.&nbsp; Here the clothes-man, the shoe vamper, and
the rag merchant display their goods as signboards to the petty
thief, and stores of old iron and bones, and heaps of mildewy
fragments of woollen, stuff, and linen rust and rot in the grimy
cellars.&rdquo;&nbsp; Expand this picture.&nbsp; Instead of one
street have several&mdash;make it the resort of all the dealers
in old clo&rsquo;, old iron, old rags, old tools, old bones, old
anything that a human creature can sell or buy; fill it with a
miscellaneous crowd of Jews, Irish, navvies, artisans,
pickpockets, and thieves, bargaining with all the energy of which
their natures are susceptible; make it damp and warm with their
vapour, and a very Babel with their discordant sounds, and you
get a dim idea of Rag Fair and its guests, unwashed as they
appear every day from twelve to two, but especially on a Sunday,
to the great scandal of the devout and respectable in that
locality, who are too apt to quarrel with the effect and forget
the cause.</p>
<p>Let us enter Houndsditch, a place where the Jews collected
together long before the royal house of Guelph occupied its
present pleasant <!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>position on the English
throne.&nbsp; Poverty and wretchedness, it may be, are bashful at
the West End, but they are not so here,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Where no contiguous palace rears its
head,<br />
To mark the meanness of their humble shed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a little court on our left, a little way down, we come to a
building known as the Old Clothes Exchange.&nbsp; The building
was erected some dozen years ago by one of the leading merchants
in the old clothes line.&nbsp; A small entrance fee is
demanded.&nbsp; You had better pay, as otherwise admission will
be denied you.&nbsp; You had better not attempt to pass in
without paying, as the toll-collector is an ex-prize-fighter; and
the chances are, in a set-to, you would come off second
best.&nbsp; If it be Sunday you had better not, especially if the
weather be warm, attempt a passage at all.&nbsp; The scrambling,
and wedging, and pushing, and driving are dreadful.&nbsp; A man
must have some nerve who forces his way in.&nbsp; In the week
day, and you are a seller, you are soon pounced on by the Jews
hungering and thirsting after bargains.&nbsp; In that peculiar
dialect affected by the ancient people you have the most
magnificent offers made.&nbsp; &ldquo;My coot friend, have you
cot any preakage?&rdquo; says one.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cot any <!-- page
120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>old boots?&rdquo; says another.&nbsp; &ldquo;I alvays
gives a coot prishe,&rdquo; says a third.&nbsp; And the seller is
surrounded by an eager crowd, as if he had the Koh-i-noor, and
was going to part with it dirt cheap.&nbsp; If you are a buyer,
you are quite as quickly attacked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Want a new
hat?&rdquo; says one.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall I sell you a coot
coat?&rdquo; says another; and whichever way you turn, you see
the same buying and selling.&nbsp; The cheap jewellery, the china
ornaments, the general wares, are not of the most
<i>recherch&eacute;</i>, but of the most popular character.&nbsp;
You may buy a stock close by that will set up all the fairs in
England.&nbsp; Here a seller of crockery ware has come back, and
is disposing of the treasures he has acquired in the course of
his travels.&nbsp; There a woman is discharging a similar
miscellaneous cargo.&nbsp; All round are buyers, examining their
goods.&nbsp; Everything here will be made useful.&nbsp; That bit
of old iron will become new; those boots, ruined, as you deemed
them, will be vamped up, and shall dance merrily to accompanying
shillalaghs at Donnybrook fair; that resplendent vest, once the
delight of Belgravia, in a few weeks will adorn Quashie as he
serenades his Mary Blane beneath West Indian moons.&nbsp; Even
those bits <!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>of waste leather will be carefully
treasured up and converted into a dye that may tint the rich
man&rsquo;s costly robe.&nbsp; Now, you need not wonder why you
find suspicious-looking men and women bargaining with your
servants for left-off clothes, or rags, or plunder of any kind,
and you are not surprised when you hear even out of this dirty
trade riches are made, and the gains are great.</p>
<p>A wit was once asked what he thought of Ireland.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; was his answer, &ldquo;I never knew before
what the people of England did with their cast-off
clothes.&rdquo;&nbsp; A similar remark might be made with regard
to Rag Fair.&nbsp; But we have not yet described the
locality.&nbsp; Very dark and very dismal, but very much inclined
to do business, the Exchange, as it is termed, is not a building
of a very gorgeous style of architecture.&nbsp; In its erection
the useful and the economical evidently was considered more than
the beautiful.&nbsp; It seems destitute alike of shape and
substance.&nbsp; Mr. Mayhew says it consists of a plot of ground
about an acre in extent; but Mr. Mayhew has certainly fallen into
error here.&nbsp; The place is scarcely fenced in; and here and
there you come to a hoarding, in the inside of which are some
stalls and benches, scarce covered <!-- page 122--><a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>from the
rain&mdash;others not so.&nbsp; Some of these benches, all
looking very dirty and greasy, are ranged back to back, and here
sit the sellers of old clothes, with their unsightly and
unsavoury store of garments strewn or piled on the ground at
their feet, while between the rows of petty dealers pass the
merchant buyers on the look-out for bargains, or the workman,
equally inclined to get as much as possible for his penny.&nbsp;
But the curious spectator must not stop here.&nbsp; Near is the
&ldquo;City Clothes Emporium,&rdquo; and all the streets and
alleys in the neighbourhood are similarly occupied.&nbsp; The
place has the appearance of a foreign colony.&nbsp; They are not
Saxon names you see, nor Saxon eyes that look wistfully at you,
nor Saxon dialects you hear, but Hebrew.&nbsp; Every street
around is part and parcel of the fair, the bazaar is but one
section of the immense market which is here carried on; but let
the anxious inquirer not be too curious or too lost in wonder,
else some prying hand may be inserted into his pocket, and the
loss of a handkerchief, or even of something else more valuable,
may be the result of a visit to Rag Fair, a place unparalleled in
this vast city for rags, and dirt, and seeming
wretchedness.&nbsp; It is true that part of the nuisance <!--
page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>is done away with.&nbsp; The police keep a close
look-out on a Sunday, and a great portion of the traffic on that
day is very properly stopped.&nbsp; But there are greater
nuisances in the neighbourhood on the Sabbath which the police do
not look after, but which they might.</p>
<h2><!-- page 124--><a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>THE COMMERCIAL ROAD<br />
<span class="smcap">and the coal-whippers</span>.</h2>
<p>The Commercial Road, abutting on the Docks and Whitechapel, is
the residence of the London coal whippers&mdash;a race of men
singularly unfortunate&mdash;the complete slaves of the publicans
of that quarter, and deserving universal sympathy.&nbsp; I have
been down in their wretched homes; I have seen father, mother,
children all sleeping, eating, living in one small apartment,
ill-ventilated, inconvenient, and unhealthy; and I believe no
class of labourers in this great metropolis, where so many
thousands are ill-paid and hard-worked, and are reduced almost to
the condition of brutes, suffer more than the coal-whippers you
meet in that busy street of traffic and toil&mdash;the Commercial
Road.</p>
<p>The coal-whippers are men employed to <i>whip</i> the coals
out of the colliers into the barges, which latter bring them up
for the supply of the inhabitants of London.&nbsp; Theirs is a
precarious and <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>laborious life, and therefore they
have special claims upon the consideration of the public.&nbsp;
Mr. Deering tells us &ldquo;it may possibly serve to bespeak
interest in the subject if it be known that it is one which
affects for weal or for woe no fewer than 10,000 persons, there
being nearly 2,000 coal-whippers, together with their wives and
families.&rdquo;&nbsp; From the opening of the
coal-whippers&rsquo; office in 1843 to the close of 1850, the
quantity of coals delivered through it was 16,864,613&frac14;
tons, and the amount of wages paid to the men during that time
was &pound;589,180 11s. 5&frac34;d.&nbsp; At times these men have
to wait long without employment, sometimes a ship only breaks
bulk, and a small quantity of coal is taken out, sometimes the
whole cargo is worked right out.&nbsp; Thus the men&rsquo;s
remuneration varies.&nbsp; In some cases a coal-whipper earns but
8s. 9d. a week, and in none more than 16s.&nbsp; Let us now speak
of the work.&nbsp; As we have already intimated, that is very
hard.&nbsp; It is carried on by gangs of nine, four work in the
hold of the ship and fill the basket, four work on the ways, and
whip the coal&mdash;that is, raise the basket to the
top&mdash;and one, the basket man, turns it into the
meter&rsquo;s box.&nbsp; The four on the whip have very hard
work, and after twelve <!-- page 126--><a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>or fourteen
tons have been raised go down into the hold, where they are
choked with coal dust, but have not quite so difficult a
task.&nbsp; Men who are employed in this labour describe it as
most laborious and irksome.&nbsp; Nor from their description can
we well conceive it to be otherwise.</p>
<p>Under the old system these men got all their work through the
public-house.&nbsp; That was a fearful system.&nbsp; We have
heard coal-whippers speak of it as &ldquo;slavery, tyranny, and
degradation;&rdquo; and well they might.&nbsp; &ldquo;The only
coves who got the work,&rdquo; as one man told us, &ldquo;were
the Lushingtons.&rdquo;&nbsp; If a man did not spend his money at
the public-house he got no employment; and actually we heard in
one case of a <i>landlady</i> who turned off a gang in the middle
of their work because they would not spend so much money in her
public-house as she thought desirable.&nbsp; One publican who had
several of these gangs under his thumb, by various exactions, we
were positively assured, made as much as &pound;35 per week by
them.&nbsp; The publicans, says Mr. Deering, the able and
intelligent secretary to the commissioners, compelled every man
to pay on an average to the amount of eight shillings, and in
some instances ten shillings, per week for <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>liquor on
shore and on board, whether drunk by him or not.&nbsp; The plan
was to compel the coal-whippers to visit their houses previous to
obtaining employment, and on the night before obtaining a ship to
commence the score, and at six o&rsquo;clock in the morning,
before going to work, to drink a pot of beer, or spirits to an
equal amount of value; then to take on board for each gang nine
pots of beer, to be repeated on delivering every forty-nine tons
during the day; after which they were compelled to pay nine or
ten shillings per man for each ship for gear.&nbsp; The evil
effects of such a system it is unnecessary to point out.&nbsp;
After a week&rsquo;s hard work, a man had nothing to take
home.&nbsp; The coal-whippers became a drunken and degraded
class, the family were starved, the boys early learned to thieve,
and the girls were too often thrown upon the streets.&nbsp; No
wonder the men rebelled against this cruel tyranny.&nbsp; For
long they bore it, but at length they plucked up courage, and
demanded deliverance.</p>
<p>Generation after generation had struggled for their rights,
and numerous Acts were passed to redress their grievances; but no
sooner was an Act passed than ways and means were found to <!--
page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>evade it.&nbsp; Then four brave men, Robert Newell,
Henry Barthorpe, George Applegate, and Daniel Brown, created
amongst their oppressed fellow-labourers an excitement which
never subsided till the Corporation of London took their case in
hand.&nbsp; Lieutenant Arnold, with a view to benefit them,
established an office, but the publicans combined against him and
drove him out of the field.&nbsp; The London Corporation
appointed a committee to examine into the whole matter.&nbsp;
Government was besieged, but Mr. Labouchere told the
coal-whippers that they could not interfere, &ldquo;as it would
be too great an interference with the rights of
labour.&rdquo;&nbsp; The coal-whippers, however, were not to be
daunted, and after years of unremitting toil, in which their
claims had become increasingly appreciated, Mr. Gladstone
prevailed upon the House of Commons to pass the Act which on the
22nd of August, 1843, received the royal assent.&nbsp; The Act
simply provided that an office should be established where the
coal-whippers should assemble, and that owners and captains of
vessels discharging their cargoes by hired men and by the process
of whipping should make to them the first offer to discharge
their cargoes.&nbsp; It in <!-- page 129--><a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>no way
interfered with or attempted to fix the price of the
labour.&nbsp; This was left as a matter of contract between
employers and employed.&nbsp; As there were conflicting interests
to be consulted, the bill provided that the proposed office
should be placed under the management of nine commissioners, four
of whom should be appointed by the Board of Trade, and four by
the Corporation of the City of London, the chairman to be the
chairman for the time being of the Shipowners&rsquo; Society of
London.&nbsp; To show how the Act has worked, we make the
following extract from an appeal to the House of Commons by the
Committee of the Registered Coal-whippers in the Port of London,
published in May of the present year, and which bears the names
of John Farrow, John Doyle, William Brown, Michael Barry, John
Cronin.&nbsp; They say:&mdash;&ldquo;The object contemplated by
the Legislature in the establishment of the office was to secure
to the men the full amount of their earnings <i>immediately</i>
after their labour was completed, with the exception of one
farthing in the shilling, which is required to be left in the
office to defray necessary expenses.&nbsp; At first the office
was fiercely opposed by interested parties, because it broke up a
system <!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>of vile, degrading, and unjust
extortion, by which these men derived their profits; but this
opposition soon subsided, the price of labour became equalised by
an understanding between the employers and the employed, the
former being at liberty to offer any price they were willing to
give, and the latter to accept or refuse as they thought proper;
and the only compulsory clause in the Act, in favour of the
coal-whippers, is that, an office being established at which they
assemble for the purpose of being hired, the shipowners <i>shall
first make an offer to the coal-whippers</i> registered at the
office, and if refused by them at the price offered, a discharge
is given, empowering the captains to obtain any other labourers
elsewhere, at not a greater price than that offered to the
registered men.&nbsp; The good effects resulting from the
establishment of the office are&mdash;relief to the men from
extortion and a demoralising system, ruinous alike to both body
and soul&mdash;a fair turn of work in rotation&mdash;immediate
payment of their wages in money&mdash;and an opportunity of
disposing of their labour (if any is to be had elsewhere) in the
interim of their clearing one ship and obtaining another.&nbsp;
The advantage to the trade has been the regularity and <!-- page
131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>certainty with which they obtain their coals from on
board ship, instead of the injurious delay which occurred before
the office was established, while the men (goaded by oppression)
and the captains were contending about the price of the labour;
and the advantage to the shipowner has been&mdash;the prevention
of delay in the delivery of his cargoes&mdash;by always finding a
sufficient number of men in attendance at the office, for the
delivery of the ships&mdash;steadiness in the price of labour,
and avoidance of detention through &lsquo;strikes&rsquo; for
higher wages, <i>and on the whole</i>, <i>a lower price for
labour than prevailed before the office was
established</i>.&nbsp; In some years, nearly &pound;100,000 has
passed through the office for wages earned, but of late that
amount has been greatly reduced in consequence of the
introduction of machinery in docks and other places; the decrease
in importation coastwise; the employment of &lsquo;<i>bon&acirc;
fide</i>&rsquo; servants by some gas companies, and by a few coal
merchants; and <i>by frequent evasions of the Act through the
interference of persons who have nothing whatever to do with the
payment of wages</i>, <i>and who derive pecuniary advantage to
themselves by so doing</i>.&nbsp; The retention of the word
&lsquo;purchaser&rsquo; in the Act gives them power to do
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>In August, 1856, the Act which did so much good
expired.&nbsp; Parliament refused to continue it on the express
promise of parties connected with the coal trade, that a model
office should be created, which should be conducted in such a
manner that the publicans should not be able to renew the hideous
evil of the old system.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">This contract
with Parliament has been broken</span>, and at this moment the
coal-whippers are suffering from a return to the fearful slavery
and tyranny of old times.&nbsp; Already one-third of the trade is
again in the hands of the publicans.&nbsp; The first thing the
model office did was immediately to throw 252 coal-whippers out
of employment.&nbsp; Of course these men were necessitated to go
to the publicans.&nbsp; Another complaint against the model
office is, that in two cases the men were paid 2d. a ton, and in
another case 3d. a ton, less than the price paid to the
office.&nbsp; Another grievance is, instead of the persons
connected with the coal trade going to the model office, the
<i>bon&acirc; fide</i> offices created by the Act, and by means
of which it was abused, still exist, and we were informed one of
the largest merchants has still his office with a gang of
eighty-one men.&nbsp; Of course the publicans <!-- page 133--><a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>are
delighted.&nbsp; They have the whole trade in their own hands
again; but this must not be.&nbsp; The righteous feeling of the
country must be interposed between the publican and his
victims&mdash;a body of hard-working men are not to be forced
into drunkenness and poverty and crime merely that a few
publicans may increase their ill-gotten gains.&nbsp; Reason,
morality, religion, all protest against such a damnable
doctrine.&nbsp; Almost immediately after the Act had ceased, the
Rev. Mr. Sangar, the rector of Shadwell, presided over a meeting
of coal-whippers &ldquo;because the coal-whipped office was
established in his parish, and because the Coal-whippers&rsquo;
Act had put down drunkenness, prevented the exactions of
middlemen, induced morality, and benefited a large number of
industrious men.&rdquo;&nbsp; Meetings for a similar purpose are
held almost every month.&nbsp; On similar grounds we have taken
up the case of the coal-whippers&mdash;and for the same reasons
we ask the aid of the charitable, and religious, and
humane.&nbsp; Especially do we ask the temperance societies of
the metropolis to interfere in this matter.&nbsp; Many of the
coal-whippers are total abstainers.&nbsp; Now that Mr.
Gladstone&rsquo;s Act is obsolete, they have some of <!-- page
134--><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>them been forced back into the public-house.&nbsp; We
must save them ere they be lost for ever.&nbsp; The coal-whippers
are in earnest in this matter.&nbsp; They want very little.&nbsp;
Simply a renewal of Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s Act, with the proviso
that there shall be only one office.&nbsp; It was the absence of
that proviso that enabled interested parties to evade the
provisions of the Act to a certain extent.&nbsp; Surely this is
no great boon for Parliament to grant.</p>
<h2><!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>THE STOCK EXCHANGE.</h2>
<p>This country, said the late Mr. Rothschild, is, in general,
the bank of the whole world.&nbsp; That distinguished capitalist
never said a truer thing.&nbsp; If Russia wants a railway, or
Turkey an army, if Ohio would borrow cash, or Timbuctoo build a
railway, they all come to London.&nbsp; The English stockholder
is the richest and softest animal under the sun&mdash;as
repudiated foreign stocks and exploded joint-stock projects at
home have too frequently illustrated.&nbsp; When the unfortunate
stockholder has in this way invested his all, the result is at
times very painful.&nbsp; The cause of this is not always to be
traced to &ldquo;greenness,&rdquo; but to the desire to derive
large dividends or interest, without due regard to the security
of the investment.&nbsp; Not even is the <i>bon&acirc; fide</i>
investor always safe.&nbsp; He is the goose that lays the golden
egg.&nbsp; In one respect this weakness is somewhat tragic.&nbsp;
For instance, to give an extreme case:&mdash;Suppose A. B.,
twelve years back, <!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>had, as the result of a life of
industry, saved &pound;5,000, and invested it in the London and
North Western Railway, when that famous stock was in demand, and
quoted as high as &pound;250, what must be the unhappy condition
of that too-confiding A. B., supposing he has not already died of
a broken heart, when he finds London and North Western stock
quoted, as at this present time, under &pound;100?&nbsp; Again,
supposing C. D. had died, leaving his disconsolate widow and
twelve children, innocent but helpless, a nice little property
consisting of shares in the Western Bank of Scotland.&nbsp; What
must be the state of that disconsolate widow and those twelve
children, innocent but helpless, upon finding that not only have
all the original shares completely vanished into ducks and
drakes, but that upon each share a responsibility of somewhere
about one hundred and fifty pounds has been incurred
besides?&nbsp; Can we calculate the sum total of bitter misery
thus created and scattered far and wide?&nbsp; As well might we
attempt to realise the dark and dismal regions of the
damned.&nbsp; The caution cannot be too often repeated, to avoid
investments which entail unknown liabilities, or which are
subject to great fluctuations of price or the amount of
dividend.&nbsp; Abundant opportunity for safe investment is
offered in the <!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>Debentures, Preference and
Guaranteed Stocks of British Railways, which pay from 4 to 5 per
cent. per annum.&nbsp; The aggregate value of the stocks and
shares which are dealt in on the London Stock Exchange is
somewhat bewildering in its enormous amount.&nbsp; First and
foremost are the several stocks constituting the National Debt of
Great Britain, which may be taken at between eight and nine
hundred millions.&nbsp; The capitals of the various British
railways amount to upwards of three hundred millions.&nbsp; The
capitals of the Bank of England and of sundry joint-stock banks
amount to more than thirty millions.&nbsp; Then there is a large
amount invested in canals, gas and water, steam, telegraph, and
dock companies.&nbsp; The total amount of American railways is
about one hundred and sixty-eight millions sterling; European
railways, two hundred millions; and those of India and our
colonies, fifty millions.&nbsp; Moreover, there is a vast
aggregate amount of foreign stocks and loans, which our readers
will not care that we particularise.</p>
<p>The grand mart for the traffic in such things is a large
building situate in Capel-court, just opposite the Bank of
England.&nbsp; It has three other entrances&mdash;one in
Shorter&rsquo;s-court, Throgmorton-street, one in New-court,
ditto, and one in Hercules-passage, <!-- page 138--><a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>Broad-street.&nbsp; You cannot get in, for a porter
guards each door, and if you elude him you are easily detected by
the <i>habitu&eacute;s</i>, and obliged to beat a precipitate
retreat.&nbsp; But from the entrance in Hercules-passage, by
peeping through the glass folding doors, you may manage to get an
imperfect view of the interior.&nbsp; You will see that in the
middle of the day there are a great number of well-dressed,
sharp-looking gentlemen talking very energetically, and
apparently doing a great deal of business.&nbsp; As they pass in
and out you hear them discourse as familiarly of thousands as</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Maids of fourteen do of puppy
dogs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me add that there are a variety of distinct
markets&mdash;the English for stocks and exchequer bills, the
foreign for stocks, and the railway and mining, and miscellaneous
share department.&nbsp; I may also add that a news-room is
attached, where the daily papers, especially the city articles,
are very eagerly perused.&nbsp; I am told that the <i>Daily
News</i> is the favourite, and that the demand for that paper is
very great.&nbsp; The Stock Exchange does not recognise in its
dealings any other parties than its own members.&nbsp; Every
bargain, therefore, whether for account of the member <!-- page
139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>effecting it, or for account of a principal, must be
fulfilled according to the regulations and usages of the
house.&nbsp; Its affairs are conducted by a committee of thirty,
annually elected.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every member of the Stock Exchange
and every clerk to a member shall attend the committee for
general purposes when required, and shall give the committee such
information as may be in his possession relative to any matter
then under investigation.&rdquo;&nbsp; The committee have the
right to expel any member guilty of dishonourable or disgraceful
conduct, or who may violate any of the regulations, or fail to
comply with any of the committee&rsquo;s decisions.</p>
<p>As regards small people outside like ourselves, the functions
of the Stock Exchange are soon fulfilled.&nbsp; I have worked
hard&mdash;I have saved a few hundreds&mdash;I want to invest
them&mdash;I call upon a stock-broker&mdash;they are (I mean
nothing offensive by the comparison) as thick as thieves in this
neighbourhood.&nbsp; I commission him to buy me a certain number
of shares in such and such a company.&nbsp; My broker rushes into
the Exchange, goes to the particular spot where the dealer in
such shares is to be met with, and buys them for me, to be
delivered on such a day.&nbsp; I <!-- page 140--><a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>pay him a
commission for brokerage, and my business is done.&nbsp; Suppose
I want to buy government stock.&nbsp; What is stock? says one,
unhappily, in consequence of his own laziness and ill-luck, or of
the laziness and ill-luck of his fathers before him, not a holder
of such.&nbsp; Stock, O benighted individual, is a term applied
to the various funds which constitute the National Debt, the
interest on which is paid half-yearly.&nbsp; Few persons buy or
sell stock except through a broker, and this is the original
business of the stockbroker, and it was for this the Stock
Exchange was erected in 1803.&nbsp; It is only since the peace
that the present immense traffic has sprung up in miscellaneous
and railway shares.&nbsp; Let me suppose I have a thousand pounds
to invest in the Three per Cents., which are now quoted at about
96.&nbsp; I wait on a stockbroker; he goes over to the Exchange
and purchases them for me, and then sees to their transfer in the
Bank of England, receiving as his commission one eighth per
cent., or 2s. 6d. in the &pound;100 upon the amount of stock
transferred.&nbsp; But I am of a speculative turn, and wish to
make a fortune rapidly by means of the Stock Exchange.&nbsp; I
again have recourse to a broker.&nbsp; As I assume that I am a
mere gambler&mdash;<!-- page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>a man of straw&mdash;I stand to lose
or gain a large sum of money on a certain contingency.&nbsp; I
draw a blank, and leave my broker in the lurch, who has to settle
his accounts as best he can.&nbsp; If he cannot pay by half-past
two on the day of settlement, which in shares is once a
fortnight, and in consols monthly, he despatches a short
communication to the committee of the Stock Exchange; an official
then suddenly gives three loud knocks with a mallet, and
announces the unpleasant fact that my broker is unable to meet
his engagements.&nbsp; He is termed a lame duck, and cannot again
figure on the Exchange till he pays a composition of 6s. 8d. in
the pound.&nbsp; The readmission of defaulters is in three
classes.&nbsp; The first class to be for cases of failure arising
from the defection of principals, or from other unfortunate
vicissitudes, where no bad faith or breach of the regulations of
the house has been practised; where the operations have been in
reasonable proportion to the defaulter&rsquo;s means or
resources; and where his general character has been
irreproachable.&nbsp; The second class, for cases marked by
indiscretion, and by the absence of reasonable caution only, or
by conduct reprehensible in other respects.&nbsp; The third class
for <!-- page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>cases where the defaulter is
ineligible under either of the former classes, but whom,
nevertheless, the committee may not feel warranted in excluding
from the Stock Exchange.&nbsp; The final decision of the
committee on each defaulter&rsquo;s application will be notified
to the members in the usual way, and remain posted in the Stock
Exchange for forty days.&nbsp; Stockbrokers rarely go into the
Bankruptcy Court, as the house appoints assignees, and settles
the affair in a much easier way.&nbsp; Lame ducks are not always
ruined in purse.&nbsp; I knew one who waddled off the Stock
Exchange, he having been a speculator on his own account, and
thus evaded the payment of rather a heavy sum.&nbsp; I met him at
Brighton this summer, living in one of the best houses in
Kemp-town.</p>
<p>Stock-brokers are very facetious fellows, and amuse their
leisure hours in many ways, such as tossing for halfcrowns in a
hat, and practical jokes; occasionally a good deal of small wit
passes current.&nbsp; I have heard of an almanac, circulated in
MS., in which the various peculiarities of individual members of
the Exchange were very cleverly hit off.&nbsp; A late Exchange
wit has given birth to the following <i>jeu d&rsquo;esprit</i>,
which has attained a wide-spread popularity in the
City:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 143--><a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>&ldquo;When the market takes a
rise,<br />
Then the public comes and buys;<br />
But when they want to realise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh! it&rsquo;s &lsquo;Oop de
doodum doo!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the government broker appears to operate on behalf of the
Commissioners, for the Reduction of the National Debt he mounts
into a &ldquo;box,&rdquo; and is surrounded by a clamorous host,
all eager to buy or sell.</p>
<p>The present number of members of the Stock Exchange approaches
nearly 800, each paying a subscription of &pound;10 per annum,
besides finding securities for between &pound;800 and &pound;900
for three years.&nbsp; Our stockbroker generally spends his money
freely.&nbsp; If he is a married man he has a nice villa at
Norwood or Clapham, and affects a stylish appearance.&nbsp; Then
there are the &ldquo;jobbers,&rdquo; who remain inside the stock
market, waiting for the broker, and who are prepared, immediately
he appears, to make a price at which they are either buyers or
sellers&mdash;the jobber calculating upon making it right with
the broker, who has undertaken an operation the reverse of his
own.&nbsp; Occasionally the jobber runs considerable risk, since,
after concluding a bargain, and while endeavouring to obtain a
profit on it, the market <!-- page 144--><a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>may
turn.&nbsp; Still he is a useful middle-man, and saves the broker
a world of trouble.</p>
<p>But there is much business transacted which is less
legitimate, and is known as time bargains, which are bargains to
deliver stock on certain days at a certain price, the seller, of
course, hoping that the price will fall, and the buyer, that it
will rise when the period for completing the bargain has
arrived.&nbsp; The speculative settlement is effected without
making full payment for stock; the losing party simply pays the
difference.&nbsp; One who speculates for a rise is a Bull (it is
said the great Rothschild made a vast deal of money in this way),
the speculator for a fall is a Bear.&nbsp; Continuation is the
interest on money lent on the security of stock.&nbsp; A great
deal of business is done in this way.&nbsp; A merchant, or a
railway company, or a bank, have large sums of money to dispose
of.&nbsp; Instead of locking it up they employ a broker, who
lends it on certain securities, for a few days or a few
weeks.&nbsp; Operations on the Stock Exchange answer in this way,
but the small tradesman, or clerk, or professional man who
ventures within the charmed circle of Capel-court for the purpose
of speculation, generally learns bitterly to rue the day.</p>
<h2><!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>THE LONDON HOSPITAL.</h2>
<p>I am walking along the streets, and in doing so pass a
scaffolding where some new buildings are being erected.&nbsp;
Suddenly I hear a shriek, and see a small crowd collected.&nbsp;
A beery Milesian, ascending a ladder with a hod of mortar, slips
and falls on the pavement below.&nbsp; He is a stranger in
London, has no friends, no money, scarcely any
acquaintance.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo; we
ask.&nbsp; &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t got no name,&rdquo; says one of
his mates; &ldquo;we calls him Carroty Bill.&rdquo;&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s to be done?&nbsp; Why, take him to the
hospital.&nbsp; The police fetch a stretcher.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Carroty Bill&rdquo; is raised on it, and a small
procession is formed.&nbsp; It swells as it goes along.&nbsp; The
idle street population joins.&nbsp; We form one.&nbsp; A medical
student is in the rear; he meets a chum, and exclaims exultingly,
&ldquo;They are taking him to our hospital.&rdquo;&nbsp; The chum
turns back, and the door is reached; admittance is easy.&nbsp;
Happily, the place is not a Government establishment, and
patients <!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>are received whilst there is
hope.&nbsp; Poor &ldquo;Carroty Bill,&rdquo; bruised and
bleeding, yet stupid with drink, is examined carefully by the
attendant surgeons.&nbsp; It is of no use asking him what&rsquo;s
the matter; his expressions, never very direct or refined, are
now very muddy, and not a little coarse.&nbsp; A careful
diagnosis reveals the extent of the injuries received.&nbsp; All
that science can do for him is done.&nbsp; If he is taken as an
inmate he will have as good nursing and food, and as skilful care
and as unremitting attention, as if he were a prince of royal
blood.&nbsp; Wonderful places are these hospitals.&nbsp; If
Sawney, subject to an unpleasant sensation on the epidermis,
blesses the memory of the good duke who erected on his broad
domain convenient posts, let us bless a thousandfold the memory
of Rahere, who obtained from Henry I. a piece of waste ground,
upon which he built a hospital (now known as St.
Bartholomew&rsquo;s) for a master, brethren, and sisters, sick
persons, and pregnant women; or of Thomas Guy, son of a
lighterman in Horsleydown; but himself a bookseller in
Lombard-street after the Great Fire; or of the nameless Prior of
Bermondsey, who founded, adjoining the wall of his monastery, a
house of alms, now <!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>known as St. Thomas&rsquo;s
Hospital.&nbsp; Likewise let us thankfully record the gifts of
the rich, of whose liberality such hospitals as those of
King&rsquo;s, and University, and Westminster, and the London,
and St. George&rsquo;s, are the magnificent results.</p>
<p>Now let us return to our friend Carroty Bill.&nbsp; As we have
intimated, he is in the ward appropriated to such cases.&nbsp;
One of the professors is now going his round, accompanied by his
students.&nbsp; Let us go in.&nbsp; The first thing that strikes
us is the size, and cleanliness, and convenience of the wards;
how comfortable they are, how light, how cheerful, how lofty, and
well ventilated!&nbsp; Each patient is stretched on a clean bed,
and at the top are pinned the particulars of his case, and on a
chair by his side are the few little necessaries he
requires.&nbsp; The practised physician soon detects the disease
and the remedies.&nbsp; His pupils are examined; the patient
forms the subject of a hasty lecture.&nbsp; One is asked what he
would do, another what disease such and such a symptom denotes; a
word is whispered to the nurse; the sick man, whose wistful eye
hangs on every movement, is bid to keep up his spirits, and he
feels all the more confident and the better fitted to struggle
back to <!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>health for the few short words of
the professor, to whom rich men pay enormous fees, and whose fame
perhaps extends over the habitable globe.&nbsp; And so we pass on
from bed to bed.&nbsp; Occasionally the professor extracts a
moral.&nbsp; This man is dying of gin.&nbsp; &ldquo;How much did
you take a day?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Only a
quartern.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;And for how many
years?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Seven.&rdquo;&nbsp; The professor
shakes his head&mdash;the students know that the man is past
cure, that death is only a question of time.&nbsp; A similar
process is gone through on the women&rsquo;s ride, and anxiously
do sad eyes follow the little group as the professor and students
pass on, in their best way mitigating human agony, and bidding
the downcast hope.&nbsp; What tales might be told!&nbsp; Here
lies down the prodigal to die; here the village maid hides her
shame beneath the dark wings of death.&nbsp; Under these hospital
walls&mdash;reared and maintained by Christian charity, what men
once proud, and rich, and great&mdash;what women once tenderly
nursed and slavishly obeyed&mdash;what beauties once fondly
caressed, old, withered, wan, without money and without friends,
alone in the bleak, bitter world&mdash;linger and pass away for
ever.</p>
<p>Let us go down stairs, along that long passage <!-- page
149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>through which eager students are hurrying.&nbsp; The
door opens, and we find ourselves in a theatre, as full as it can
possibly be of the future surgeons of England, now very rough and
noisy.&nbsp; At the bottom, far beneath us, is a small space with
a long narrow table, covered with oilskin; behind the table is a
door.&nbsp; That door opens, and one or two of the
<i>&eacute;lite</i> of the students known as dressers
enter.&nbsp; A matronly female, dressed in the hospital garb,
follows; some stout porters bring in a poor creature gently, and
place him on the table, and a few professors and professional
assistants fill up the group; the noisy students are still and
eager.&nbsp; The professor advances to the table, in a few words
explains the nature of the malady, and the patient, more dead
than alive, endeavours to nerve himself for his impending
fate.&nbsp; It is our old friend; his leg is smashed and requires
amputation.&nbsp; An assistant administers chloroform, while the
operator looks on, watch in hand.&nbsp; In a few seconds it is
clear the patient is insensible, and the knife is handed to the
operator, who, with his arm bare, and his sleeves tucked up,
commences his painful task.&nbsp; Up squirts the red blood, and
many a pale face and averted eye around testify how painful the
exhibition is to <!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>those who are not accustomed to
it.&nbsp; Happily, the medical men near have the calm composure
and readiness of resource true science suggests.&nbsp; The first
incision made, and the skin peeled around, an assistant hands a
saw, and in the twinkling of an eye the limb is severed, and the
stump, bleeding and smoking, is being sewn up by skilful hands
almost before the poor fellow wakes up, wearied and exhausted by
loss of blood, from what must have been to him, if we may judge
by his moans and exclamations, a terrible dream.&nbsp; As soon as
possible he is borne away, the blood is sponged up, the table
wiped down; and another patient, it may be a pale-faced girl or a
little boy suffering from some fatal malformation,
succeeds.&nbsp; All that humanity can suggest is resorted
to.&nbsp; Here science loses her stern aspects, and beats with a
woman&rsquo;s tenderness and love; and not in vain, for from that
table rise, who otherwise would have painfully perished, many to
bless their families, it may be the world.&nbsp; But all is over,
and we follow the crowd out, avoiding that other passage leading
to the dissecting-room, where on many a table lie the mangled
forms of what were once men and women, in all stages of <!-- page
151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>dissection and decay, with students hard at work on
them, painfully gathering or seeking to gather a clue to the
mystery of mysteries we call life.&nbsp; Possibly by the
fire-place some half-dozen young fellows will be smoking and
drinking beer.&nbsp; But why note the contrast?&nbsp; Out of the
dissecting-room, beyond the narrow precincts of the hospital,
masked in gay clothes, with faces all red with paint and wrinkled
with idiotic leer, stand side by side the living and the
dead.</p>

<p>The principal London Hospitals are the following:&mdash;1. St.
Bartholomew&rsquo;s Hospital, in West Smithfield, first founded
in the twelfth century, and refounded by Henry VIII. in
1546.&nbsp; The building, a spacious quadrangular structure, is
principally modern, having been finished in 1770.&nbsp; It makes
up 580 beds.&nbsp; In 1848,71,573 were relieved by this hospital,
viz., 5,826 inpatients, 19,149 out-patients, and 46,598 casual
ditto.&nbsp; Necessity is the only recommendation to this
institution; and patients are received without limitation.&nbsp;
The medical staff is equal to any in the metropolis.&nbsp; The
staircase was gratuitously painted by Hogarth.&nbsp; 2.
Guy&rsquo;s Hospital, St. <!-- page 152--><a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>Thomas&rsquo;s Street, Southwark, founded in 1721,
contains accommodation for 580 in-patients, and has an excellent
museum and theatre of anatomy.&nbsp; This magnificent hospital,
which consists of two quadrangles and two wings, was founded and
endowed by Thomas Guy, a bookseller, who expended &pound;18,793
upon the building, and left &pound;219,419 for its
endowment&mdash;the largest sum, perhaps, that has ever been
expended by any individual on similar purposes.&nbsp; Recently,
however, Guy&rsquo;s Hospital has met with another benefactor,
but little inferior, in point of liberality, to its founder; a
citizen, of the name of Thomas Hunt, having bequeathed to it, in
1829, the princely sum of &pound;200,000!&nbsp; The medical
school attached to this hospital, while under the superintendence
of the late Sir Astley Cooper, was one of the most extensive, and
probably, also, the best in the empire.&nbsp; 3. St.
Thomas&rsquo;s Hospital, in High Street, Borough, was formed out
of two other charities by Edward VI., and rebuilt in 1693.&nbsp;
Additions were made in 1732, and a large part was rebuilt in
1836.&nbsp; It contains 18 wards, and 428 beds.&nbsp; It has an
income of about &pound;25,000 a year, derived almost wholly from
rents of estates in London and the country.&nbsp; <!-- page
153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>4.
St. George&rsquo;s Hospital, near Hyde Park Corner, lately
rebuilt, has a fine front, 200 feet in length, facing the Green
Park.&nbsp; It accommodates 460 in-patients.&nbsp; 5. The
Middlesex Hospital, near Oxford Street, founded in 1745, has 285
beds, and relieves numerous out-patients.&nbsp; 6. London
Hospital, in Whitechapel, was founded in 1740.&nbsp; Its wards
accommodate about 250 patients.&nbsp; 7. Westminster Hospital,
rebuilt in 1833, near the Abbey, has 174 beds; but three wards,
containing space for fifty additional beds, are unfurnished,
notwithstanding there is a great demand for hospital
accommodation.&nbsp; 8. The Marylebone and Paddington Hospital,
opened in 1850, has 150 beds, which it is proposed to increase to
376, supposing the necessary funds to be forthcoming.&nbsp; This,
and the four last mentioned hospitals, depend wholly, or almost
wholly, on voluntary subscriptions, which are said to be very
insufficient to meet the demands upon them.&nbsp; The University
College and King&rsquo;s College Hospitals, and Charing Cross
Hospital, are smaller establishments of the same nature, each
accommodating about 120 patients, and there are other
establishments of the same description.&nbsp; Medical schools are
connected with the above <!-- page 154--><a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>hospitals,
in which lectures are delivered by the officers, and which are
attended by several hundreds of students.&nbsp; Within the last
few years the number of medical students has considerably
decreased.</p>

<p>The worst effects of drunkenness are, perhaps, after all, its
indirect ones.&nbsp; It is a sad sight to see man stricken down
in his prime, and woman in her beauty; to see individuals&rsquo;
hopes and prospects blighted; to see in that carcase staggering
by the utter wreck and ruin of an immortal soul.&nbsp; But this
is but a small portion of the damage done to humanity by the
ravages of intemperance.&nbsp; Look at our great social
evil.&nbsp; I need not name it.&nbsp; No one who walks the
streets of London by night requires to be informed what that
is.&nbsp; Has drink nothing to do with it?&nbsp; Ask that
unfortunate, who has just commenced her evening&rsquo;s
walk.&nbsp; She will tell you that when she parted with her
innocence she had previously been drugged with drink; that if it
were not for drink she could not pursue her unhallowed career;
that her victims are stimulated by drink; and that without the
gin-palace or the public-house she and such as she could not
exist.&nbsp; I do not <!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>now speak of the worst forms of
prostitution, of the gin-palaces in the East frequented by
drunken sailors, where women are kept as a source of attraction
and revenue; but of the better classes, of the dashing women who
are supplied with expensive dresses by respectable Oxford-street
tradesmen in the expectation of being paid by some rich victim;
the women whom you meet dressed so gay in Regent-street or
Portland-place.</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a rascally old nobleman who lived
in a big house in Piccadilly.&nbsp; Mr. Raikes describes him as
&ldquo;a little sharp-looking man, very irritable, and swore like
10,000 troopers, enormously rich, and very selfish.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He sat all day long at a low window, leering at beauty as it
passed by, and under his window was a groom waiting on horseback
to carry his messages to any one whom he remarked in the
street.&nbsp; If one did not know that we lived in a highly moral
age, one would fancy many such old noblemen lived in the
neighbourhood of Portland-place, for in the streets leading
thence, and reaching as far back as Tottenham-court-road, we have
an immense female population, all existing and centred there, who
live by vicious means&mdash;all with the common feeling of <!--
page 157--><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>their sex rooted out and destroyed; all intended by
nature to diffuse happiness around; all a curse on all with whom
they have to do.&nbsp; In this small circle, there is enough
vicious leaven to leaven all London.&nbsp; It is impossible to
get a true estimate of their number.&nbsp; Guesses of all kinds
have been made, but none are exactly to be depended on.&nbsp; In
a great capital like ours, where wealthy sensualists can and do
pay enormous sums for the gratification of their whims&mdash;(I
have seen it stated that on one occasion a gentleman went into a
house in Norton-street with a &pound;500 bank-note, and after
staying a few hours received but &pound;20 change)&mdash;it is
not alone the professedly vicious&mdash;the class whom we call
prostitutes&mdash;who prostitute themselves.&nbsp; As fine shops
are pointed out in fashionable streets, which are said to be
houses of the most infamous description, in spite of the display
of lace and millinery in the window, so there are thousands of
women, supposed to be respectable, and to live in a respectable
manner, who yet are to all intents and purposes prostitutes,
though they would not be classified as such.&nbsp; Now the number
of this latter class is much exaggerated.&nbsp; Towards the close
of the last century, when the population of London amounted to
about a <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>million, Dr. Colquhoun, magistrate
of the Thames Police, asserted the number of prostitutes to be at
least 50,000.&nbsp; If prostitution has followed the same ratio
of increase as the population, the number now must be considered
as truly appalling.&nbsp; But evidently the Doctor&rsquo;s
estimate is exaggerated.&nbsp; At a period much nearer to our
own, Mr. Chadwick puts down the number, excluding the City, at
7,000; Mr. Mayne, at from 8,000 to 10,000.&nbsp; The City Police
estimates the number at 8,000, and this estimate is supported by
Dr. Ryan, and Mr. Talbot, secretary to the Association formed in
London for the protection of young girls.&nbsp; This is a very
high figure; but a recent French writer tells us that in London,
in the higher ranks of life, the proportion of vicious women to
virtuous are as one to three! and in the lower ranks virtue does
not exist at all!!!&nbsp; At any rate, there is reason to believe
that in London there are 5,000 infamous houses.&nbsp; If besides
we reckon up the procuresses, the keepers of low gin-palaces and
beer-shops, where women are the bait, we are lost and bewildered,
and dare not trust ourselves to give in numbers any idea of the
persons directly and indirectly connected with prostitution, or
of the <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>sum spent annually in London on that
vice alone.&nbsp; And all this is carried on in the most
methodical way.&nbsp; There are men and women whose constant
employment is to search all parts of the metropolis for fresh
victims; and to them young girls from the country and servant
maids-of-all-work are easy prey.&nbsp; Then letters are written
and sent to the clubs and to the patrons of such infamy, and they
are furnished with all the particulars, and the price of the
victim&rsquo;s willing or unwilling seduction and shame.&nbsp;
This state of things is progressive.&nbsp; Last year the returns
of the City missionaries show an increase in their districts of
fallen women to the number of 1,035.&nbsp; Of course it is only
with the dregs that the City missionary comes in contact.&nbsp;
While a woman preserves her health, and youth, and good looks,
she lives in better quarters than those into which the City
missionary generally finds his way.&nbsp; For a time she is gay;
she dresses fine, spends money freely, drinks, and sings, and
then prematurely becomes old, and sad, and poor.</p>
<p>Is this ever to be so?&nbsp; Is woman always to sell herself
to man?&nbsp; And is man to dream that the smile thus bought is
no lie, but a precious truth?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t suppose that if
men were temperate <!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>universal chastity would be the
result; but that we should have less immorality is, I think, an
admitted fact.&nbsp; Why are women, prostitutes?&nbsp; Chiefly,
we are told, because of poverty; and of all causes of poverty, is
not intemperance the greatest?&nbsp; Would you see how one vice
is connected with another?&nbsp; Come up Portland-place at
night.&nbsp; True, there are no public-houses here, but they are
plentiful enough in the neighbourhood; and in them all night the
men and painted women from Portland-place madden themselves with
drink.&nbsp; Yes, here are the women that should have been
British wives and mothers utterly perverted, and dragging down
with them many a heart that might have emerged into a noble
life.&nbsp; Lust and intemperance have slain them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lost, lost, lost for ever!&rdquo; is the cry that greets
us as we look at them.</p>
<p>An association has been formed in this neighbourhood to wipe
away this plague spot.&nbsp; In their report, the committee
state, when the movement commenced, which issued in the
establishment of the association at the close of 1857, the
condition of the districts (All Souls and Trinity), comprising
the streets lying immediately <!-- page 161--><a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>to the
eastward of Portland-place, was perfectly appalling.&nbsp; It was
then calculated that in those streets there were not less than
140 notorious houses of ill-fame, containing from six to ten
fallen women each, which fearful array of prostitution was
swelled by a large number of young women, lodging in the
districts, who were known to be gaining their livelihood
nominally by working for shops, but principally by the means of
night prostitution.&nbsp; One natural result of this dense
aggregation of depravity in a narrow spot was the front of
insolent and shameless defiance which vice had put on.&nbsp;
Indecent exhibitions in broad day from the windows of these
houses, utterances the most revolting, that startled and shocked
the ear of the passenger who had unwarily penetrated these haunts
of infamy, together with the outrageous conduct of the unhappy
children of shame, who even before the shades of night had fallen
were wont to come forth in hundreds upon the pavements of
Portland-place and Regent-street, seemed to indicate a
determination that no vestige of respectability should be
suffered to linger in a neighbourhood which not thirty years
before was as pure and as much resorted to as any of <!-- page
162--><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>the most favoured districts of western London.&nbsp;
The keepers of these houses were many of them foreigners; some
were known to the police as determined forgers, gamblers, and
thieves.&nbsp; Others, indeed the principal part, were females
grown old in the path of depravity, in whose bosom every spark of
womanly tenderness had become quenched; who could treat, indeed,
with a show of kindness the unhappy girls they had enticed to
their doors, so long as they were able to satisfy their
exorbitant demands, but who did not hesitate to cast them out
into a deeper degradation, or utter destitution, the moment a
decay of their attractions or ill health had disabled them from
paying the extravagant charges for their hired rooms and
dresses.&nbsp; Riotous and brutal outrages were constantly taking
place in these houses, and evidence that crimes of violence and
sensuality of the darkest type had been enacted in them came to
light.&nbsp; It was, moreover, ascertained that among those
wretched traders in sin were those who had embarked in a still
more repulsive branch of their guilty trade, and were making
large gains by turning their houses into receptacles for young
unfallen girls imported from abroad, who were <!-- page 163--><a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>sold over
from time to time to the neighbouring brothel keepers.&nbsp; Such
was the awful moral pestilence which, up to that time, was raging
unchecked, and year by year it was rapidly enlarging the area of
its ravages.</p>
<p>At the meeting held to receive this report, the Rev. Mr.
Garnier stated that &ldquo;he visited himself a house in
Norton-street, where in one room he saw a seat placed around so
as to hold as many of the poor creatures as possible on a day
that was appointed for brothel keepers, to attend and bid for
their purchase (hear, and much sensation).&nbsp; The unfortunate
girls thus disposed of were brought from abroad, and while
connected with the House of Commons he had the best evidence of
this, for noblemen and members of parliament showed letters they
continually received soliciting them to partake of the depravity
(much sensation).&nbsp; The letters spoke of a beautiful girl
just imported from Belgium or France, and the nobleman or
gentleman, whichever he might be, was asked to visit her, as she
was at his service.&nbsp; In one case a letter was received from
the rectory district of that parish (Marylebone), in which it was
stated that a girl at a certain address was ready to be given up
to lust <!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>to the highest bidder.&nbsp; These
letters were addressed to the Speaker as well as the members of
the House of Commons, and this, together with the spectacle he
(the Rev. gentleman) witnessed in Norton-street, was, he
considered, very good evidence of the abominable traffic that was
carried on in this country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rev. Mr. Marks said, within the last fifteen months
he was called to visit three Jewesses, painful as the duty was,
and this visit was made in the Rev. Mr. Garnier&rsquo;s
district.&nbsp; These three girls had been imported for the
purposes of prostitution (hear, hear).&nbsp; In one case alone he
was enabled to take the poor creature from the abominable vice
that threatened her, and sent her home; and he nearly succeeded
with another, but with regret&mdash;aye, deep regret, he said
so&mdash;he was prevented.&nbsp; A sum of &pound;200 had been
offered to retain the girl, and this sum was offered by the
brother of an M.P.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The discussion of the delicate question, as the <i>Times</i>
terms it, has lately received new light in an unexpected
quarter.&nbsp; The victims themselves have taken to
writing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Another Unfortunate&rdquo; describes her
parents.&nbsp; They were drunkards&mdash;their chief expense was
gin&mdash;their children were <!-- page 165--><a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>left to
grow up without moral training of any kind.&nbsp; The writer
says:&mdash;&ldquo;We heard nothing of religion.&nbsp; Sometimes
when a neighbour died we went to the burial, and thus got within
a few steps of the church.&nbsp; If a grand funeral chanced to
fall in our way we went to see that, too&mdash;the fine black
horses and nodding plumes&mdash;as we went to see the soldiers
when we could for a lark.&nbsp; No parson ever came near
us.&nbsp; The place where we lived was too dirty for nicely-shod
gentlemen.&nbsp; &lsquo;The publicans and sinners&rsquo; of our
circumscribed, but thickly-populated locality had no
&lsquo;friend&rsquo; among them.&nbsp; Our neighbourhood
furnished many subjects to the treadmill, the hulks, and the
colonies, and some to the gallows.&nbsp; We lived with the fear
of these things, and not with the fear of God before our
eyes.&rdquo;&nbsp; From such a training could we expect
otherwise?&nbsp; The writer asks what business has society to
persecute such as she: a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good
fruit; the unfortunate is the fruit, and society is the tree.</p>
<p>It is in vain that we reclaim the women.&nbsp; The only
remedy&mdash;the only way to put down the social evil&mdash;is to
reclaim the men.</p>
<h2><!-- page 166--><a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>MARK-LANE.</h2>
<p>On a Monday morning, especially on the Eastern Counties lines,
the trains running into town have an unusually large number of
passengers.&nbsp; They consist generally of the jolly-looking
fellows who, at the time of the cattle show, take the town by
storm, and fill every omnibus and cab, and dining room, and place
of public amusement, and then as suddenly retire as if they were
a Tartar horde, dashing into some rich and luxurious capital,
then vanishing with their booty, none know whither.&nbsp;
However, penetrate into Mark-lane, you may see them every Monday
and Friday, smelling very strong of tobacco smoke&mdash;for,
although smoking is absurdly and strictly prohibited on railways,
it is a known fact that people will smoke nevertheless&mdash;and
with the air of men who are not troubled about trifles, and have
their pockets well lined with cash.&nbsp; These are the merchants
and millers and maltsters of Mark-lane.&nbsp; All England waits
for their reports; <!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>their decisions affect the prices of
grain at Chicago on one side, and far in the ports of the Black
Sea on the other.&nbsp; Bread is the staff of life, and its
traffic affects the weal or woe of empires.&nbsp; Prices low in
Mark-lane, and in the garrets of London, in the cellars of
Manchester, in the wynds of Edinburgh, there is joy.&nbsp; As we
may suppose, the trade in grain is one of the most ancient in the
world.&nbsp; There were corn merchants and millers long before
Mark-lane was built.&nbsp; Originally the corn merchants of the
metropolis assembled at a place called Bark&rsquo;s Quay, where
now the Custom-house stands.&nbsp; Then they moved into
Whitechapel, somewhere near Aldgate Church, and then the Corn
Exchange in Mark-lane was built.&nbsp; Originally there was but
one exchange, that erected in 1749, which is private property,
and the money for which was raised in eighty hundred-pound
shares; each share at this time being worth &pound;1,300.&nbsp;
This, I believe, is the only metropolitan market for corn, grain,
and seeds.&nbsp; The market days are Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday; hours, ten to three.&nbsp; Wheat is paid for in bills at
one month, and other corn and grain in bills at two months.&nbsp;
The Kentish hoymen, <!-- page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>distinguishable by their
sailors&rsquo; jackets, have stands free of expense, and pay less
for metage and dues than others, and the Essex dealers enjoy some
privileges; in both cases said to be in consideration of the men
of Kent and Essex having continued to supply the city when it was
ravaged by the plague.&nbsp; Old Mark-lane consists of an open
Doric colonnade, within which the factors have their
stands.&nbsp; It resembles the atrium, or place of audience in
the Pompeian house, with its impluvium, the place in the centre
in which the rain fell.&nbsp; In this market, managed by a
committee and secretary, there was no foreign competition.&nbsp;
At this time there are about seventy-two stands, and more than a
hundred subscribers of five guineas each.&nbsp; I believe the
stands are from thirty to forty pounds a year.&nbsp; Now at one
time this place was quite a close borough.&nbsp; There were more
factors than the place could hold, and when a stand was vacant it
was given to some poor broken-down man, who would not be likely
to interfere with the jolly business which the rest were carrying
on.&nbsp; The excluded were very indignant.&nbsp; They planted
themselves in Mark-lane.&nbsp; They did business in the street
outside the Exchange.&nbsp; They were men of equal <!-- page
169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>standing and respectability with any of the privileged;
and after an immense amount of grumbling and growling, they did
as most Englishmen would have done&mdash;went to Parliament, and
got an Act to have a second Exchange erected side by side with
the old one.&nbsp; This second erection was completed in 1826,
and in the partition are now a couple of arches, which were
placed there in order that, if at any time the old Exchange were
amalgamated with the new&mdash;a consummation of which there
seems no chance at present&mdash;the whole may be formed into one
capacious market.&nbsp; The new Exchange has a central Grecian
Doric portico, surmounted by imperial arms and agricultural
emblems, the ends having corresponding pilasters.&nbsp; Here
lightermen and granary-keepers have stands as well as corn
merchants, factors, and millers.&nbsp; At the further end of this
building there is a seed-market; nor is this all.&nbsp; Attached
to the new Exchange is an hotel, in the upper room of which is an
auction room for the sale of damaged cargoes; and on the other
side&mdash;that is, above the old Exchange&mdash;is a
subscription refreshment room, known as Jack&rsquo;s, where most
of the Norfolk flour is sold, a great deal of it being paid for
in ready money, <!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>and then resold again downstairs, on
the usual credit, the profit on such a transaction being the odd
threepence or sixpence, which becomes a respectable sum if you
buy or sell a thousand quarters.&nbsp; Up here are the millers or
their agents in large quantities.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are not,&rdquo;
said one to the writer, &ldquo;the rogues the world takes us
for.&nbsp; If we don&rsquo;t sell good flour, the bakers
can&rsquo;t sell their bread.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us hope this is
true; but in these days of universal rascaldom, when gold, no
matter how dishonestly acquired, makes its possessor an object of
respect, and not of scorn, what wonder is it that we believe that
there are rogues in grain as well as in other trades?&nbsp; In
the middle of the old Exchange you will see an immense number of
foreigners; these are Greeks, living all together in the
neighbourhood of Finsbury-square, who are gradually getting all
the foreign trade&mdash;what are our English merchants
about?&mdash;of the country into their hands.&nbsp; It is the
Greeks, not the English, who buy up the corn shipped from the
ports of the Black Sea, and pour it into the English
market.&nbsp; Besides these Greeks, you will see captains of
vessels in great numbers waiting to hear if their cargoes are
sold, and where they are to be taken.&nbsp; A <!-- page 171--><a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>busy scene
is Mark-lane, especially on a Monday.&nbsp; The malt tax in 1857
was &pound;6,470,010, which represents an enormous amount of
malt, of which a great part is sold in Mark-lane.&nbsp; In the
year 1857 there were imported into the United Kingdom 3,473,957
quarters of wheat, 1,701,470 of barley, 1,710,299 of oats, 76,048
of rye, 159,899 of peas, 305,775 of beans, 1,150,783 of Indian
corn, 188 of buck-wheat, and 2,763 of bere or bigg; and in the
same year there were imported 2,184,176 cwts. of flour and
meal.&nbsp; Then we must not forget the home produce, which is
principally brought into London by ships, though a great deal of
it comes up by rail.&nbsp; In London alone the consumption of
wheat in the shape of flour and otherwise may be estimated at
upwards of 1,600,000 quarters a year.&nbsp; But Mark-lane is not,
like Smithfield, a market for London alone.&nbsp; On the
contrary, it is attended by buyers from all parts of the
country.&nbsp; The cargoes in the river sold at Mark-lane may be
landed at Leith, or Glasgow, or Liverpool, or even in the distant
ports of Cork, or Belfast, or Dublin.&nbsp; Well may there be a
bustle in Mark-lane.&nbsp; At eleven the market commences, and at
the various stands preparations are made for the business of the
<!-- page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>day by untying and placing on the stands little bags
containing samples of every conceivable species of grain eatable
by man or beast.&nbsp; At the end of the day the floor is covered
with the samples which the buyer, after rubbing over in his hands
and inspecting, has thrown down.&nbsp; The sweepings are
afterwards gathered up and sold, and realise, I believe, a very
handsome sum in the course of the year.&nbsp; At half-past two a
beadle rings a bell, and no more are permitted to enter the
Exchange.&nbsp; Those that are there hastily finish their
business, tie up their samples, swallow a chop, rush off to their
respective termini, and in two or three hours are perhaps more
than a hundred miles away.&nbsp; Mark-lane for the rest of the
week is a dull, dirty lane, with but few passengers, and very
dark and dull indeed.</p>
<p>Yet Mark-lane has its romances.&nbsp; Look around you; not a
man perhaps but can tell you of enormous profits and enormous
losses.&nbsp; The trade carried on here is of so speculative a
character that but few realise money by it after all.&nbsp; Come
to this stand.&nbsp; It was calculated the other day that the
firm carrying on business here were losing at the rate of a
thousand pounds per hour.&nbsp; Hear this factor: &ldquo;I once
bought some Windsor <!-- page 173--><a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>beans at an early hour in the
morning at 32s. a quarter, and sold them the same day at
64s.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet our informant has been compelled to settle
with his creditors.&nbsp; You may point to me a man who has not
been reduced to this, but he is a <i>rara avis</i>, and he can
tell you how, perhaps, another day or another hour would have
made him a bankrupt.&nbsp; The rule is a crisis and a crash; not
a disgraceful one&mdash;for the unlucky ones, many of them,
manage to pay twenty shillings in the pound eventually&mdash;but
a crisis and a temporary suspension.&nbsp; In some cases where a
man has been in trade many years, and has accumulated a handsome
fortune, one unlucky speculation scatters it all, and compels
him&mdash;old, and destitute of the energy of youth&mdash;to
begin business again.&nbsp; This is hard, but it cannot be
helped.&nbsp; Men who have been on the Exchange long can tell you
funny stories of how they came at seven in the morning and
cleared handsome sums of money before they went home to
breakfast, and broke all the laws against regrating and
forestalling which the thoughtful stupidity of our ancestors had
devised&mdash;in order that bread, the staff of life, might not
be high in price&mdash;on a most royal scale.&nbsp; We do not
hear of such things <!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>now, nor do the mobs of London now
break into the Quaker Chapels to see if the flour is hidden
there&mdash;an amiable weakness to which the mob was much given
towards the end of the last century, when wheat was at famine
prices, and the loaf was cheap at two and tenpence.&nbsp; We are
fallen upon better days, upon days of free trade, when the
English artisan, in order that bread may be cheap, has his
emissaries and agents scouring all parts of the old world and the
new.</p>

CATHEDRAL.</h2>
<p>In that celebrated chapter in which Gibbon explains the rise
and progress on natural grounds of the Christian religion, it has
always seemed to us that he has not done justice to the immense
influence which the institution of the pulpit must originally
have possessed.&nbsp; Had he gone no further than the pages of
his New Testament, the distinguished historian would have found
many an instance of oratorical success.&nbsp; He would have read
how Herod quailed before the rude orator who in the desert drew
multitudes to hear him as he proclaimed the advent of the
Messiah, and warned a generation of vipers to flee from the wrath
to come; he would have read how, whilst the Teacher spake as
never man spake, the common people heard him gladly; how Felix
trembled in his pride and power, and how the polished intellect
of Athens listened, and admired, and believed, while Paul
preached of an <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>unknown God.&nbsp; It is true that
in a subsequent chapter Gibbon does not altogether ignore the
pulpit, and admits the sacred orators possessed some advantages
over the advocate or the tribune.&nbsp; &ldquo;The arguments and
rhetoric of the latter,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;were instantly
opposed with equal arms by skilful and resolute antagonists, and
the cause of truth and reason might derive an accidental support
from the conflict of hostile passions.&nbsp; The bishop, or some
distinguished presbyter to whom he cautiously delegated the
powers of preaching, harangued without the danger of interruption
or reply a submissive multitude whose minds had been prepared and
subdued by the awful ceremonies of religion.&nbsp; Such was the
strict subordination of the Roman Catholic Church, that the same
concerted sounds might issue at once from a hundred pulpits of
Italy or Egypt, if they were <i>tuned</i> by the master hand of
the Roman or Alexandrian bishop.&rdquo;&nbsp; But much more than
this may be said.&nbsp; Wonderful is the power of oratory.&nbsp;
Gibbon may have under-rated it, for we know that he never could
summon up the requisite courage to make a speech in Parliament;
but nevertheless rare power is his, who can speak what will touch
the <!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>hearts, and form the opinion, and
mould the lives of men.&nbsp; The more unlettered be the age, the
more triumphant will be this power; and when the theme is the
stupendous one of religion&mdash;when in it, according to the
belief of preacher and hearer, eternal interests are
involved&mdash;woe that shall never pass away&mdash;joy that
shall never die&mdash;when, moreover, this living appeal is put
in the place of dead form or dreary routine, what wonder is it
that before it should fade away the pagan faith of Greece or
Rome?&nbsp; The pulpit and Christianity are identical.&nbsp; In
times of reformation and revival, the pulpit has ever been a
power.&nbsp; When spiritual darkness has come down upon the
land&mdash;when the oracles have been dumb&mdash;when the sacred
fire on the altar has ceased to burn, the pulpit has been a form,
a perquisite, a sham, rather than a message of peace and glad
tidings to the weary and heavy laden.</p>
<p>How comes it to pass that in these days the pulpit of the
Establishment has failed to be this?&nbsp; Mr. Christmas, a
clergyman of the Established Church, in a volume recently
published, seeks to answer this question.&nbsp; To use his own
language, &ldquo;the author had long felt that through some <!--
page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>cause or other the Church had not secured that hold on
the attention of the multitude without which her ministration
could be but partially effective.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why, even in these
few lines we see a reason of the failure which Mr. Christmas
mourns.&nbsp; Clergymen live in a world of their own, and will
not look at facts as worldly men are compelled to do.&nbsp; Now,
as a matter of fact, the Church of England is not the church, but
merely a section of the church; and yet you cannot go into an
episcopalian place of worship but you hear what the church
says&mdash;what the church holds&mdash;what the church
commands&mdash;when common sense tells every one that the speaker
is merely referring to the Establishment in England, and that
even if he were appealing to the custom and tradition of that
body of believers which, in all countries and ages, constitutes
the church, the inquiry is of little consequence after
all&mdash;the appeal, in reality, being to the Bible, and the
Bible alone, which, in the well-worn language of Chillingworth,
is the religion of Protestants.&nbsp; Thus is it so much
preaching in the Church of England fails to reach and attract the
masses.&nbsp; The ministers will deal in fictions&mdash;will
exclaim, &ldquo;Hear the church&rdquo;&mdash;will wander away
from topics of human interest <!-- page 179--><a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>into
questions with which the educated (and still more the uneducated)
mind has no sympathy.&nbsp; The middle-class public go to
hear&mdash;for it is the genteel thing to go to church&mdash;but
they sit silent, passive, exhausted by the long preliminary
service, wearied, and unmoved.&nbsp; What wonder is it that the
more independent and manly&mdash;the men who do not fear Mrs.
Grundy&mdash;who are not afraid of conventionalisms, either stop
at home, or leave the Establishment for the more living service
of dissent?&nbsp; Mr. Christmas observes:&mdash;&ldquo;Few will
venture to say that the style of preaching most valued among
nonconformists is inferior to that heard from the pulpits of the
Establishment.&rdquo;&nbsp; The reason is not far to seek:
dissent has no ancient prestige to plead; dissent has no rich
endowment to fall back on; dissent lives on and is strong in
spite of the cold shade of aristocracy, or of the sneer of the
bigot or the fool; dissent depends upon the pulpit.&nbsp; If that
be weak and cold, and dull and dim, dissent melts like snow
beneath the warm breath of the south.&nbsp; Dissent reminds us
more than the Establishment of the earlier period of
Christianity, of the Carpenter&rsquo;s Son who had not where to
lay his head; whose apostles were <!-- page 180--><a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>fishermen,
and whose kingdom, to use His own emphatic declaration,
&ldquo;was not of this world.&rdquo;&nbsp; The public mind is
shocked and estranged when it hears the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, as he did the other day, defending a recent
ecclesiastical appointment, on the plea that the fortunate
individual was a man of blameless life, of high family, and great
wealth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. A. B.,&rdquo; says Mr. Christmas,
&ldquo;must be a clergyman, and Mr. A. B. has not the gift of
utterance.&nbsp; Well, he will be able to read his sermons, and
the rest of his brethren do the like.&nbsp; It is no detriment to
a man&rsquo;s prospects that the church is half empty when he
preaches.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is a very learned man&mdash;or a very
well connected man&mdash;or a very good man&mdash;or an excellent
parish priest: it is a pity he is not more successful in the
pulpit; but then, really, preaching is the smallest part of a
clergyman&rsquo;s duty.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Such is the way in
which such a subject is treated within the pale of the
Establishment.</p>
<p>But the Sunday Evening Service at St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral
is an answer to all this.&nbsp; Let us see!&nbsp; On a cold
winter evening, underneath its magnificent dome, are seated some
three thousand well-dressed people.&nbsp; On the first occasion
of <!-- page 181--><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>holding evening service, the scene was rather
indecorous for Sunday evening.&nbsp; A large number of those who
had been unable to obtain admission to the service were lingering
about the south door, and as the carriages of the Lord Mayor and
other civic dignitaries were leaving with their occupants, the
assembled crowd gave vent to their feelings by unmistakable
groans of displeasure, as if they considered themselves to have
been unfairly excluded.&nbsp; But this is over&mdash;the thing
has become a fact.&nbsp; The audience has toned down to the level
English standard of propriety.&nbsp; The sublime service, in
spite of its length and monotony, has been listened to with a
patience almost devout; and the choir, &ldquo;200 trebles and
altos, 150 tenors, and 150 basses,&rdquo; the largest and most
complete choir that was ever yet organised, has done its part to
heighten the rapture and piety of the night.&nbsp; A clergyman
now ascends the pulpit to preach.&nbsp; He is a popular
clergyman&mdash;the crowd to-night is larger than it has ever yet
been&mdash;active, learned, industrious, charitable,
devout.&nbsp; He is the Rev. Canon Dale, rector of St.
Pancras.&nbsp; Yet what is his theme?&nbsp; The Church&mdash;the
Mother of us all&mdash;the divinely appointed means of
man&rsquo;s recovery from the <!-- page 182--><a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>power and
the consequence of sin.&nbsp; Is not this a fatal blunder?&nbsp;
What man wants is, not the Church, but the message it
proclaims&mdash;the voice itself, not the messenger&mdash;the
good tidings of great joy, not the human instruments by which
they are revealed to man.</p>
<p>But this service shows the strength of the church in the
metropolis.&nbsp; The reply to this, we fear, is
unsatisfactory.&nbsp; The present able Bishop of London is
endeavouring to procure a union of the City churches.&nbsp; The
answers to the inquiries of the bishop made by the clergy present
some curious features.&nbsp; The Rev. J. Charlesworth, rector of
the joint parishes of St. Mildred, Bread-street, and St. Margaret
Moses, replies in answer to the bishop&rsquo;s interrogatories
that the largest attendance at any of his church services is ten,
that his net income is &pound;220 a year, and that the population
is 258.&nbsp; The Rev. J. Minchin, rector of the joint parishes
of St. Mildred, Poultry, and St. Mary, Colechurch, reports that
the largest attendance at his service is 30, his net income
&pound;280, and the population 600.&nbsp; The Rev. Thomas
Darling, rector of St. Michael Paternoster Royal and St.
Martin&rsquo;s Vintry, reports that his largest attendance is 25,
his net income <!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>&pound;240, population 430.&nbsp;
The Rev. Dr. Kynaston, high master of St. Paul&rsquo;s School,
reports that the attendance at the church of the joint parishes
of St. Nicholas Cole Abbey and St. Nicholas Olave, of which he is
rector, is 30, his income &pound;263, with a house in good
repair, population 592.&nbsp; The Rev. Charles Mackenzie, rector
of the joint parishes of St. Benet, Gracechurch, and St. Leonard,
Eastcheap, states the attendance at 48, net income &pound;287,
population 300.&nbsp; The Rev. Dr. Stebbing, rector of St. Mary
Somerset and St. Mary Woolchurch Haw, reports that his largest
attendance is 40, net income &pound;250, population
unknown.&nbsp; The Rev. Thomas Jones, rector of Allhallows,
Lombard-street, reports that his largest attendance is 50, his
net income &pound;396, population 456.&nbsp; The Rev. F. J.
Stainforth, incumbent of Allhallows Staining, reports that his
largest attendance is 50, net income &pound;800, population
500.&nbsp; Many more of the same sort might be given from the
official returns, and in some cases there is an attendance of 100
or 150 persons where the income of the incumbent is upwards of
&pound;1,000 a year.</p>
<p>One reason of this wretched state of things we have hinted
at.&nbsp; The removal of the city population, <!-- page 184--><a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>we may be
told, is another: but the population in the neighbourhood of
these places is sufficient to fill them were the population given
to church-going.&nbsp; With all due deference, we would fain ask
the clergy if they do not fail to attract the public, owing to
their themes and manner of treating them?&nbsp; Some preachers
always manage to bring in the Old Testament dispensation.&nbsp;
The preacher is dwelling among the priests and Levites:
perpetually he tells you what the Jews did and did not; how they
were a stiff-necked people; how they went after strange gods; how
their nation was blotted out, and their temple razed to the
ground, and their very name became a reproach.&nbsp; Man needs
not the Hebrew learning, but the Christian faith; not the voice
that thundered from Sinai, but the accents of mercy that were
heard on Calvary in that awful hour when the earth trembled, when
the grave gave up its dead, when the veil of the Temple was rent
in twain, and the Son of Man died upon the cross.&nbsp; The
preacher of the class we have referred to almost seems to think
otherwise: he ignores the present, and lives only in the
past.&nbsp; He is worse than a lawyer with his precedents.&nbsp;
His dialect is obsolete, and a stumbling-block to <!-- page
185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>active, earnest, intelligent living men, whether rich
or poor.&nbsp; He is like a man with corks, who is afraid to cut
them off, and strike out boldly for himself.&nbsp; He cannot ask
you for a penny for a new church without showing how liberally
the Jews supported the public worship of their day.&nbsp; He is
great in Deuteronomy and Leviticus.&nbsp; He seems as if he could
have no faith in Christianity unless he could lock it up with Old
Testament texts.&nbsp; &ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; writes Erasmus, in
his &ldquo;Age of Religious Revolution,&rdquo; &ldquo;two
things&mdash;that the study of Hebrew will promote Judaism, and
that the study of philology will revive Paganism.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Really we sometimes are inclined to believe that the first fear
has been realised.&nbsp; Many a preacher reminds us of Bishop
Corbett&rsquo;s &ldquo;Distracted Puritan,&rdquo; when he
says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the blessed tongue of Canaan<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I placed my chiefest pleasure,<br />
&rsquo;Till I prick&rsquo;d my foot with a Hebrew root,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And it bled beyond all measure.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can well imagine many a preacher thus speaking, and feel
disposed to wish that such might prick their feet with Hebrew
roots till they wholly discontinue their references to extinct
forms of worship, and apply the truth that Christ <!-- page
186--><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>came to preach to man&rsquo;s present position&mdash;to
the hopes and fears&mdash;to the struggles and duties&mdash;to
the passions and vanities of to-day.&nbsp; There is progress
everywhere.&nbsp; Why should preaching be the exception?&nbsp;
If, as is admitted, the eloquence of the bar or senate has
declined, may we not naturally conclude that in that of the
pulpit there has been a falling off as well, especially when we
remember how much the press has supplemented the latter?&nbsp;
Verily, the clergy, whether in or out of the Establishment, must
exert themselves.&nbsp; The nation demands that the enormous
wealth and patronage possessed by the latter be devoted to
something more than refined enjoyment or epicurean ease.&nbsp; It
is not churches we want, but parsons.&nbsp; An orator can preach
anywhere, as well from an old tub as from a pulpit, costly and
consecrated, and curiously wrought.</p>

class="pagenum">p. 187</span>AN OMNIBUS YARD.</h2>
<p>In one of the remotest of the Fejee Islands some Wesleyan
missionaries, in the year 1851, landed a pair of horses.&nbsp; We
read general excitement prevailed at the towns near, and a great
muster gathered on the beach at the day of landing.&nbsp; It was
long before the native mind got reconciled to the
phenomenon.&nbsp; The people, we are told, were terrified if
approached by a horse.&nbsp; They would jump into the river, run
up cocoa-nut and other trees, and climb houses for safety while
the animal passed their place.&nbsp; In England this stage of
terror has long been passed, and horses themselves are gradually
giving place to steam.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, for short traffic&mdash;for transit to places
where the snort of the steam engine will never be heard&mdash;for
crooked ways inimical to machinery&mdash;for the convenience of
those who like to be taken up and set down at their own
doors&mdash;for the comfort of the nervous, whose firm belief is,
that for the regular railway traveller <!-- page 188--><a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>a fatal
smash is only a question of time, the London omnibus is a
permanent institution.&nbsp; It is difficult to perceive how
people managed before it had an existence&mdash;when the fare
from Highbury to the Bank was a shilling, and when the traveller
for the journey from Highgate to London, along the dreary wastes
of Holloway, paid no less than half-a-crown, and when even for
that exorbitant sum, as it would now be deemed, you had no chance
of a trip unless you had booked your place.&nbsp; In those times
happy&mdash;yea, thrice happy&mdash;were the fathers of families
living beyond the sound of Bow bells.&nbsp; In these, how can a
man help going to the bad, rise he ever so early, or sit he up
ever so late, eat he ever so of the bread of carefulness, if
mamma and daughters can ride from the furthest suburbs&mdash;from
remote Peckham or airy Paddington&mdash;for the ridiculously
small sum of sixpence, or even less, in a vehicle as luxuriously
fitted up as a private carriage, to the shops so tempting to the
female mind of the fashionable and dissipated West?&nbsp; Happily
the evil is tending to cure itself.&nbsp; The ladies have
acquired a mode of dressing which simply renders, in the majority
of cases, the use of an omnibus an impossibility.</p>
<p><!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>The date of the London omnibus is not ancient.&nbsp;
Mr. Shillibeer, in his evidence before the Board of Health,
stated that on July 7th, 1829, he started the first pair of
omnibuses in the metropolis, from the Bank to the Yorkshire
Stingo, New-road, copied from Paris, where omnibuses had been
established in 1819, by M. Lafitte, the banker.&nbsp; Each
omnibus was drawn by three horses abreast, had no outside
passengers, and carried twenty-two inside.&nbsp; Now the same
distance is traversed by omnibuses carrying twenty-four
passengers&mdash;twelve inside and twelve out&mdash;and drawn by
two horses, for sixpence.&nbsp; At one time the passengers were
provided with periodicals&mdash;a custom that would be quite
superfluous when for a penny the traveller can get all the
day&rsquo;s news.&nbsp; Shillibeer&rsquo;s first conductors were
two sons of British naval officers, who were succeeded by young
men in velvet liveries.&nbsp; Shillibeer met with the usual fate
of those who labour for the public, and was ruined; but the
system he introduced has expanded with the growth of London, and
has reached a gigantic extent.&nbsp; One company alone&mdash;the
General Omnibus Company&mdash;a company which has effected a
thorough reform in the omnibus service, <!-- page 190--><a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>and
deserves the thanks of the public, had, in the first half year of
the year 1858, 602 omnibuses running, travelling in the half-year
5,815,036 miles, and carrying 16,800,000 passengers, and pays
Government a duty of &pound;4,000 a month.&nbsp; As their yard in
Highbury is the largest of the kind, let me conduct the reader
thither.</p>
<p>On the main Islington road, not far from Highbury-corner, just
opposite Union Chapel, there is a stable-yard, at the entrance of
which there are generally two or three &rsquo;buses changing
horses; a board over it denotes that it is the stabling of the
London General Omnibus Company.&nbsp; If we go up that yard we
shall find that we are in a vast square, occupying nearly twenty
acres of ground, and running as far back as the
Liverpool-road.&nbsp; To the right of us are enormous stables,
each stable containing forty horses, all comfortably bedded down
in straw, resting after their labours, and recruiting their
strength for fresh ones.&nbsp; The horses do not work too hard,
not more than three hours out of the twenty-four, and consume
daily 18 lbs. of corn and 10 lbs. of chaff.&nbsp; To each
omnibus&mdash;with the exception of the few drawn by three
horses, <!-- page 191--><a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>which have a dozen&mdash;there are
ten horses attached&mdash;which are never changed&mdash;which are
all numbered, and the fullest particulars of which are entered in
a book kept by the active and intelligent foreman of the
yard.&nbsp; There is a horse-keeper to each set, who knows the
times of his omnibus, and acts accordingly.&nbsp; In the middle
of the yard is an immense shed, under which the omnibuses are
drawn at night and washed and cleaned for the next day.&nbsp;
This washing is done very easily.&nbsp; An enormous tank, holding
27,000 gallons of water, supplies several tubs, against which
each omnibus is placed.&nbsp; There is a watchman, who comes on
at nine at night and receives the omnibuses as they come in, and
ranges them in the order in which, on the following morning, they
will commence their respective exits.&nbsp; At half-past seven
the first omnibus leaves the yard; the next follows eight minutes
afterwards, and so on all the rest of the day.&nbsp; The
omnibuses that commence early, finish their day&rsquo;s work
about nine.&nbsp; Those who go on duty later wait and bring home
the pleasure-seekers returning from the theatres and exhibitions,
and other places of public resort.&nbsp; For the accommodation of
these latter classes extra <!-- page 192--><a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>omnibuses
are required.&nbsp; Some of the omnibuses, we must add, work
early and late; but then they have a good rest in the middle of
the day.&nbsp; It is a hard life, that of an
omnibus&mdash;citizens are apt to get fat, and stones are very
trying.&nbsp; At a considerable expense, every &rsquo;bus must be
done up and repainted and revarnished every two years.&nbsp; The
original cost of each &rsquo;bus is about &pound;120.&nbsp; They
are all built in the yard, of iron and good oak and ash.&nbsp; In
one part of the premises there is a steam-engine at work, sawing
wood and turning machinery.&nbsp; In another part there are
&rsquo;buses in all stages of development&mdash;here a frame,
there a complete body, and there one with wheels waiting for the
varnish, and paint and velvet cushions and plate glass, which
shall make it differ from what it now is, as does Sappho</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;At her toilette&rsquo;s
greasy task,<br />
With Sappho fragrant at an evening mask.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But let us return to the horses.&nbsp; We have spoken of those
in good health and in active work.&nbsp; Some of them are really
capital cattle; and I was shown a pair of chestnuts worth at
least a hundred pounds.&nbsp; We will now proceed to the
infirmary, just premising that in so enormous <!-- page 193--><a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>a yard
every precaution is taken against disease.&nbsp; A man is
constantly at work whitewashing the stables.&nbsp; This takes him
four months, and by the time he has done he has to commence
anew.&nbsp; The infirmary consists of a series of roomy, brick
stables, very warm and snug, where the dumb animals are treated
more tenderly than many Christians.&nbsp; In another part there
is a large inclosure, more than half covered, but open on one
side for the recovery of the horses, who, having nothing
particularly the matter with them, but who have lived too fast or
worked too much, require a month or two of rest.&nbsp; The aged
and the incurable are drafted off and sent to the repository, and
sold for a few pounds.&nbsp; Let me add, even these horses
continue their philanthropic career.&nbsp; No longer engaged in
conveying the verdant youth of the metropolis to business or
pleasure, they drag greens from door to door.&nbsp; The shoeing
forge is close by.&nbsp; The physicking and shoeing is taken by
contract, by one man.&nbsp; He must have enough to do, as in this
yard and the one close by are generally a thousand horses.&nbsp;
The food, prepared by steam, is ground at the dep&ocirc;t in
Bell-lane.</p>
<p>Now for a word about the men.&nbsp; There are <!-- page
194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>about three hundred in the Highbury yard.&nbsp; The
coachmen have six shillings, the conductors four shillings a day,
and are paid daily.&nbsp; The horse-keepers have a guinea a
week.&nbsp; The artisans employed in the carriage department earn
from thirty to fifty shillings a week.&nbsp; There are two sick
clubs, one for the coachmen and conductors, who pay sixpence a
week, and receive when ill fourteen shillings a week&mdash;and
one for the horse-keepers, who pay threepence a week, and receive
when on the sick list ten shillings weekly.&nbsp; On Sunday
evening Divine Service is held in the harness-room, fitted up for
that purpose.&nbsp; This was commenced by Sir Horace St.
Paul.&nbsp; Once a year a grand tea-meeting is held, at which all
the servants of the company, with their wives and families, are
present, and addresses are delivered by Sir Horace St. Paul, Mr.
Hanbury, M.P., and other philanthropists; and for those who wish
to improve a leisure hour, a small reading-room is opened, access
to which may be had on the payment of a penny weekly.&nbsp; On
the table are some newspapers and illustrated periodicals, and
thus not only is a little mental stimulus provided, but the men
are not driven to spend their money in a public-house.&nbsp; This
is a <!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>feature of the yard which cannot be
too highly commended, and which I am sure if it were known the
general public would be happy to support.&nbsp; The men are
satisfied, I think.&nbsp; One of them I had known in better days
seemed glad to have secured a berth as a driver.&nbsp; One
informed me that he had &pound;100, which he had told his Missus
to draw out of the savings bank and place in the custody of the
Royal British; but his Missus was obstinate, and her obstinacy
saved the cash.&nbsp; Some of the men are teetotallers, and those
who wish to attend church or chapel on the Sunday can do
so.&nbsp; It is an advantage in a great company that it cannot
resort to the little meanness and persecution of which a single
proprietor may be guilty.&nbsp; The latter may underpay his
servants, keep them at work all day, or take every advantage of
them in every possible way.&nbsp; But if a great company does
this, the public cries shame.&nbsp; But we must be off.&nbsp;
Once more we find ourselves in the road; a &rsquo;bus comes
up&mdash;we climb the roof&mdash;we have seen baronets and
M.P.&rsquo;s get inside; an opposition &rsquo;bus is behind;
&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; cries the conductor.&nbsp; Merrily we
rush on, exclaiming mentally&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ore favete omnes et tempora cingite
ramis.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>As a contrast, let me quote the following from Miss
Meteyard&rsquo;s essay on the history and present condition of
the Metropolitan omnibus drivers and conductors, published in
Cassell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Working Man&rsquo;s Friend and Family
Instructor,&rdquo; in 1850.&nbsp; Our readers will see that in
the last few years a great and desirable change has been
made.&nbsp; Miss Meteyard says:&mdash;&ldquo;As we have said,
11,000 individuals are connected with the omnibus labour of the
metropolis.&nbsp; Of these, 6,000 are drivers and conductors, who
work on an average rather more than sixteen hours a day; namely,
from before eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning till after twelve
o&rsquo;clock at night.&nbsp; The labour connected with railway
omnibuses is still severer than this, being twenty hours each
third day, and fourteen on alternate ones.&nbsp; Nor does the
seventh day bring rest, as in most laborious occupations; work
goes on in precisely the same manner; and, as on some lines of
road, the traffic is greater on Sundays than on other days, the
work is so far heavier.&nbsp; During the number of hours the men
are employed they <i>have no rest</i>.&nbsp; The driver never
leaves his box, except during a few occasional minutes whilst his
horses are changed; and he has, therefore, to take his <!-- page
197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>meals during these periods, and usually upon the
coach-box, as, where the men have wives and families, some member
of them may be often seen handing up the tea or dinner in a can
or basket.&nbsp; As the married portion of these men universally
say, they &lsquo;never see their children except as they may look
at them in bed;&rsquo; and as for home, in its commonly-received
sense, or of any of the moral duties connected with it, the one
is unknown, and the other is impossible.&nbsp; The case of the
conductors is precisely the same, neither having a day&rsquo;s
rest for months together, for if they take one they have to pay a
substitute; and in many cases the proprietors object to a
day&rsquo;s relaxation, and will not hire men who need or may ask
for it, such being against the laws of their particular
association.&nbsp; For a loss of time they are fined 2s. 6d., and
for a second or third offence, suspended from a week&rsquo;s
employment, or else dismissed.&nbsp; Against stringent rules of
this kind we should take no objection, were the hours of labour
in any degree of reasonable length; in that case, stringency
would be doubly effective, both as regarded the interest of the
proprietary and public convenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking at this preposterous amount of daily <!-- page
198--><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>labour, and the evils which, directly and indirectly,
must flow therefrom, in relation to pauperism, crime, and a low
average of life, we should expect to find omnibus labour highly
remunerated.&nbsp; Yet such is not the case.&nbsp; On some roads
the drivers receive no more than from twelve to fifteen shillings
for the work of seven days; and out of this they are compelled by
their employers to pay six shillings weekly as beer-money to
horse-keepers and stable-keepers.&nbsp; Of course, with wages at
so low a par, and so much reduced by outgoings, men would
scarcely be found willing to undertake this week&rsquo;s work of
a hundred and twelve hours, unless each driver were allowed, as
is the case, the privilege of an outside passenger, on the box
beside him, each distance he drives, whether the fare be sixpence
or threepence.&nbsp; Each driver drives ten or twelve distances
per day, each distance to and fro being about six miles; and
thus, in fine weather, when the generality of male passengers
prefer the outside, and the coach-box is sure of an occupant, the
driver&rsquo;s perquisites may mount up to a fair weekly
sum.&nbsp; But in wet and bad weather the case is very different,
and these men drive the whole <!-- page 199--><a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>day through
without a single passenger.&nbsp; This may possibly account for
the variable temper of omnibus-drivers, who, reversing the
ordinary process of things, are surly in fine, and courteous in
wet weather, and, caring nothing for patronage whilst the sun
shines, grow civil in times of frost and rain, and proffer, with
parental solicitude, cape, wrapper, and apron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though acting in a more responsible capacity, the
conductors, unlike the drivers, are only daily servants, and
liable, and often subject to, dismissal, at a moment&rsquo;s
notice.&nbsp; Men once thus dismissed are rarely employed as
conductors again, it being a rule with these combined proprietors
never to employ a man in this capacity who has acted as conductor
in any previous situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The London public are not of the opinion of Shelley, that
flesh of bullocks and sheep, when properly cooked, is the true
cause of original sin, and that to regain the innocence of the
Garden of Eden we have but to have recourse solely to a
vegetarian diet.&nbsp; This doctrine has never been a popular
one, and from the earliest time the contrary has found favour in
the eyes of men.&nbsp; With what gusto does Homer describe the
banquets before the walls of Troy, when heroes were the guests,
and where divine Achilles was the head cook!&nbsp; The custom of
eating baked and boiled is one of the few good things we have to
thank antiquity for.&nbsp; Our jolly Scandinavian forefathers
considered eating horse rump steak a sign of orthodox paganism;
and at this very moment, if the <i>Times</i> be a correct index
of the national sentiment, the great question that agitates the
mind of the middle class public, that public in which, according
to general opinion, all <!-- page 201--><a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>the piety,
and patriotism, and wisdom of the land is concentrated, is not as
to peace or war&mdash;not as to Reform or Social Science&mdash;or
education or religion&mdash;not as to how the vice and impiety of
the day may be grappled with and reclaimed&mdash;but as to how a
man may genteelly dine his friends, and, with an income of a few
hundreds, provide a repast that shall rival that of one whose
income consists of as many thousands.&nbsp; Really, the force of
folly can no further go.&nbsp; Hence, then, it is clear that to
the present customs of society a cattle-market of some kind is
essential.&nbsp; At one time it was held in Smithfield.&nbsp;
There it was a dangerous nuisance.&nbsp; The wise men of London
did as they generally do in such matters&mdash;first denied that
it was a nuisance at all, and when they were driven from that
position, and compelled to yield to public indignation, moved it
a little further off.</p>
<p>It is early morn, and we wend our way to the New
Cattle-market, in Holloway, near the model gaol, and lying in
that <i>terra incognita</i> stretching away to Camden-town and
the steep of Highgate-hill, where juvenile cockneys some thirty
years ago played, and called the waste Copenhagen-fields.&nbsp;
There the New Cattle-market is erected.&nbsp; <!-- page 202--><a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>In shape it
consists of a long square, if I may be allowed such an
expression, on every side surrounded with lofty walls, and covers
many acres of ground.&nbsp; In the centre of the market is a
lofty clock-tower, and around it are shops devoted to the sale of
horse gear and cattle-physic, and the banking-houses, where the
cattle are paid for and the money deposited, chief amongst which
is that of an active alderman of the city of London, and ex-Lord
Mayor and M.P.&nbsp; The animals are ranged in pairs, others tied
to rails all around; and on the other side are layers, where the
animals that are not sold are lodged on payment of a trifling
sum, and slaughtering-houses.&nbsp; The salesmen, who are the
middle-men, receive the cattle from the drover, and sell them to
the butcher, and pay the money into the bank.&nbsp; The extent of
the market is about ten acres.&nbsp; The market is the property
of the Corporation, who exact a toll of 3&frac12;d. for each
beast, and 4d. a score of sheep; then there is a further charge
of 1s. a pen.&nbsp; As there are 1,800 pens and 1,450 rails, this
rent must amount to a respectable sum.&nbsp; In round numbers,
the accommodation provided is for 25,000 sheep and 7,300
beasts.&nbsp; The summer is the best time for seeing <!-- page
203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>the market, as in the winter months it is not so
numerously attended.&nbsp; The market opens at two, <span
class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and closes at two, <span
class="smcap">p.m.</span>&nbsp; Any buying and selling after that
hour is most strictly prohibited.&nbsp; The entrance into the
market is not open, as in Smithfield, but through iron gates,
guarded by vigilant police.&nbsp; The public-houses in the
neighbourhood abound in signs not known in more fashionable
districts.&nbsp; Here is the &ldquo;Butchers&rsquo; Arms,&rdquo;
there the &ldquo;White Horse;&rdquo; here the &ldquo;Lamb&rdquo;
Tavern, there the &ldquo;Red Lion;&rdquo; and great is the
business they do on Mondays and Thursdays.&nbsp; The men are of a
class not visible elsewhere in London.&nbsp; Farmers, graziers,
jockeys, jobbers, pig-drivers, salesmen, drovers abound here,
whose speciality is to know</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Qu&aelig; cura bovum, qui
cultus habendo,<br />
Sit pecori.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However early you may come in the morning, you may be sure
they are there before you.&nbsp; At twelve o&rsquo;clock on
Sunday night the Sunday is supposed to be over, and the poor
beasts, who have been shut up ever since twelve on Saturday
night, are released from their confinement.&nbsp; Now comes the
difficulty and confusion.&nbsp; How can <!-- page 204--><a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>the beasts
belonging to one man be prevented from mixing with those of
another?&nbsp; How can they be got into proper order?&nbsp; I
fear the answer must be chiefly by a system of terrorism and
physical force.&nbsp; Those wonderfully sagacious brutes the
drovers&rsquo; dogs know every animal, know where he is to go,
know where he ought not to go, and take care that, somehow or
other, the object aimed at by the defunct Administrative Reform
Association should be achieved, and that the right one should be
in the right place.&nbsp; Of a night the scene is something
extraordinary.&nbsp; The lowing of oxen, the tremulous cries of
the sheep, the barking of dogs, the rattling of sticks on the
bodies and heads of the animals, the rough and ragged appearance
of the men, the shouts of the drovers, and the flashing about of
torches, present altogether a wild and terrific
combination.&nbsp; But all this is over by daylight, when the
buyers come upon the scene, and there is an appearance of order
and cleanliness, a strong contrast to Smithfield, as your eye
glances from one row to another of heads gathered from
Northamptonshire, from Leicestershire, from Scotland, from
Ireland, from the fertile plains of far-away Holstein, or the
pastures of Spain, still <!-- page 205--><a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>more
remote.&nbsp; The latter animals it seems almost a pity to
slaughter; they have something of the appearance of the buffalo,
minus his shaggy head of horrid hair; they are cream-coloured,
and with their long horns must be a very pretty ornament for a
gentleman&rsquo;s park.&nbsp; Our foreign trade in cattle is
growing very large.&nbsp; In the year 1857 there were imported
into the United Kingdom, oxen and bulls, 53,277; cows, 12,371;
calves, 27,315; sheep, 162,324; lambs, 14,883; swine,
10,678.&nbsp; The greater proportion come from Holland and
Denmark, and are put upon the rail and at once sent off to
London.&nbsp; There was a time when we were told this would be
the ruin of the farmer; yet, according to the speech of Mr. Grey,
a north country agriculturist, the other day, it appears that
growing flesh is the most remunerative employment for the farmer
at the present time; and in spite of all this foreign
importation, we may observe that meat is high, and that
Paterfamilias, blessed, as he is sure to be, with a small income
and a large family, finds it difficult to make both ends
meet.&nbsp; The returns of the cattle-markets tell us that the
population of London consume annually 277,000 bullocks, 30,000
calves, 1,480,000 sheep, and <!-- page 206--><a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>34,000
pigs.&nbsp; Mr. Hicks estimates the value of these at between
seven and eight millions sterling.&nbsp; The buyers here are the
larger class of dealers; the smaller ones go to the dead-meat
market in Newgate-street, which is blocked up by them from four
in the morning till breakfast-time.&nbsp; If we come here on a
Friday, between ten and four, we shall find a market for the sale
of horses and donkeys&mdash;a market much patronised by
costermongers.&nbsp; Let us add, in conclusion, that the New
Cattle-market bids fair to be as much of a nuisance as the old,
and that, sooner or later, there must be a dead-meat market for
London, and that alone; otherwise we shall have a repetition of
the sad tragedy to which the poet refers, when he writes of
&ldquo;the cow with the crumpled horn, who tossed the maiden all
forlorn.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 207--><a name="page207"></a><span

<p>Is in the Strand&mdash;or in Westminster&mdash;and the
contrast between its silence and stillness and the bustle of the
streets is something wonderful.&nbsp; You feel as you enter as if
you were in a charmed land.&nbsp; With Tennyson&rsquo;s
lotus-eaters you exclaim, &ldquo;There is no joy but calm.&nbsp;
Why should we only toil, the roof and crown of
things?&rdquo;&nbsp; Charles Lamb&rsquo;s description of the
South Sea House might have been penned for a Government
Office.&nbsp; The place seems to belong not to the living
present.&nbsp; The windows, double glazed, keep out the roar of
the outside world.&nbsp; The chairs and tables, of massive
mahogany, seem as if of the time of the ancients.&nbsp; The
Turkey carpet has a smack of the primitive political Eden, ere
man sinned, and Lord John Russell introduced his Reform
Bill.&nbsp; This may be a railroad age, but it is not in a
Government Office that that truth is recognised.&nbsp; The young
men are generally reading the papers, or eating <!-- page
208--><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>lunch; the seniors are doing the same, but in a more
dignified manner.&nbsp; In an office where there are several, to
find a couple at real hard work from ten till four is, I fear, a
rarity.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Knight, when Henry VIII. had stripped Wolsey
of Whitehall, and other possessions, he constructed there, for
the amusement of his leisure, a tennis-court, a bowling-green,
and a cock-pit.&nbsp; The tennis-court and the bowling-green have
left no traces.&nbsp; The cockpit went through a variety of
transmutations, till it settled down into a treasury.&nbsp; In
the reign of Anne, the lord high treasurer Godolphin sat three or
four times a week at the cock-pit, &ldquo;to determine and settle
matters relating to the public treasure and
revenues.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was the old building fronting the
banqueting house, which Mr. Barry has recently metamorphosed into
a magnificent wing of his uniform edifice.&nbsp; The old office
of Godolphin, however, is but a small part of the modern
treasury.&nbsp; The offices of the more important functionaries
are in the large building behind, which fronts the esplanade in
St. James&rsquo;s Park.&nbsp; Several offices were destroyed in
1733, in order to erect the present building facing the parade,
the expense of which was estimated <!-- page 209--><a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>at
&pound;9,000.&nbsp; The fa&ccedil;ade consists of a double
basement of the Doric order, and a projection in the centre, on
which are four Ionic pillars supporting an entablature and
pediment.</p>
<p>Where the treasury of the kings of England had its abiding
place&mdash;or, more properly, where its <i>eidolon</i> or
Platonic idea lodged, before it took up its abode in the
cock-pit&mdash;were hard to say.&nbsp; The exchequer, which in
the reign of Edward I. was literally the king&rsquo;s strong box,
was, in his time, lodged in the cloisters of Westminster
Abbey.&nbsp; Sir Francis Palgrave says, that the earliest place
of deposit for the royal treasures which can be traced is
&ldquo;that very ancient apartment, described as the
&lsquo;Treasure in the cloisters of the Abbey in Westminster,
next the Chapter-house,&rsquo; and in which the pix is still
contained.&nbsp; This building is a vaulted chamber, supported by
a single pillar; and it must remain with the architectural
antiquary to decide why a structure in the early Romanesque
style, ranging with the massy semicircular arch in the south
transept, acknowledged to be a portion of the structure raised by
the Confessor, may not also have been erected in the reign of the
last legitimate Anglo-Saxon king.&nbsp; In this treasury the
regalia and <!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>crown jewels were deposited, as well
as the records.&nbsp; The ancient double oak doors, strongly
grated and barred with iron, and locked with three keys, yet
remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The theory of the British treasury was much the same during
the nomad period of its existence that it has continued to be in
its settled and citizen-like life.&nbsp; There was from the
beginning a treasurer, whose office it was to devise schemes for
raising money, to manage the royal property to the best
advantage, and to strike out the most economical and efficient
modes of expenditure.&nbsp; He had even then the control of all
the officers employed in collecting the customs and royal
revenues, the disposal of offices in the customs throughout the
kingdom, the nomination of escheators in the counties, and the
leasing of crown lands.&nbsp; Then, as a check upon the
malversion of this officer, there was the exchequer, the great
conservator of the revenues of the nation.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
exchequer,&rdquo; said Mr. Ellis, clerk of the pells, when
examined before the finance commissioners, &ldquo;is at least
coeval with the Norman Conquest, and has been from its earliest
institution looked to as a check upon the lord high treasurer,
and a protection for the king, as <!-- page 211--><a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>well as for
the subject, in the custody, payment, and issue of the public
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is still the broad outline of the treasury&mdash;of the
finance department of the State of Great Britain.&nbsp; The
enormous magnitude of the empire has caused the subordinate
departments of customs, the mint, &amp;c., to expand until they
have attained an organisation, an individual importance, a
history of their own.&nbsp; The different modes of transacting
money-business, rendered necessary by its greater amount and more
complicated nature, have altered the routine both of the treasury
and the exchequer; the changed relations of king and parliament
have subjected the treasury and exchequer to new control and
superintendence.&nbsp; Still their mutual relations, and the part
they play in the economy of the empire, remain essentially the
same as in older times.</p>
<p>The lords commissioners of the treasury (for the office of
lord high treasurer has for many years been put in commission)
have their office at Whitehall, in the building whose history we
have briefly traced.&nbsp; The exchequer, or more properly
&ldquo;the receipt of exchequer,&rdquo; has its office at
Whitehall Yard.&nbsp; But we must not descend to
particulars.&nbsp; The only place in the wide world <!-- page
212--><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>where change comes not&mdash;where the main object
seems to be how not to do it&mdash;where antiquated routine has
its stronghold&mdash;is a government office.</p>
<p>Those of our readers who have read&mdash;and who has
not?&mdash;Captain Marryatt&rsquo;s graphic descriptions of
seafaring life, entitled &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s Own,&rdquo; will
remember the scene in which Captain Capperbar ingeniously manages
to supply, from the ship&rsquo;s stores, all his own and her
ladyship&rsquo;s domestic wants.&nbsp; The ship&rsquo;s
carpenters are engaged in framing chests of drawers, and building
dining-tables.&nbsp; Fully aware of the mischievous effects of
idleness, the captain&rsquo;s lady finds employment for the
ship&rsquo;s painters in her attics.&nbsp; The armourers, instead
of preparing the murderous weapons of war, are peacefully
occupied in making rakes and hoes for the especial benefit of the
junior members of the same devoted family.&nbsp; Does the fair
spouse of the gallant captain need even a pole for the
clothes-line, a boat-mast is immediately dedicated to that
important service.&nbsp; Thus, the captain turns his devotion for
his country to some account; and if his patriotism be a virtue,
it is one that brings with it its own reward.</p>
<p><!-- page 213--><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>Granting, which we readily do, that the above scene is
an exaggeration, still we believe it to be nearer the mark than
the opposite representations, which would lead us to believe that
all persons in the employ of Government are overworked and
underpaid.&nbsp; Their places are sinecures; bread for
life.&nbsp; Every merchant or employer of labour has the power of
instant dismissal; but in Government offices this great check on
idleness and stupidity is ignored.&nbsp; Officials are happy
fellows.&nbsp; The ills of life do not affect them.&nbsp; Mills
may stop, panics may take place, commerce may decline, ships may
rot in deserted harbours; docks and warehouses, once teeming with
busy life, may be silent as the grave&mdash;but their income
knows no change, save when death causes a general promotion in
their ranks.&nbsp; The agricultural mind may be weighed down with
grief&mdash;it may find its idols but clay.&nbsp; There, where it
must live, or bear no life, it may find all hollow, delusive, and
false.&nbsp; The seasons may be unpropitious.&nbsp; The common
ills farmers are heir to, such as potato disease, the fly at the
turnips, the rot in the sheep, may be theirs in no common degree;
nevertheless, the Clapham omnibus duly deposits at the Treasury
in Downing-street <!-- page 214--><a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>Mr. Smith, who, with the exception
of two hours for lunch, and another hour or so for miscellaneous
conversation, and the perusal of the <i>Times</i>, will, from ten
till four, magnanimously devote himself to his country&rsquo;s
good.&nbsp; At the hour of four, Mr. Smith is again on the
omnibus, about to seek, in the bosom of his family, that
relaxation which, did his country deny him, it would be
ungrateful indeed.&nbsp; Mr. Smith is a family man; and,
regardless of London temptations, he hastens to his mutton at
five.&nbsp; On the contrary, the junior clerk, Mr. Adolphus
Blaser, is a young man about town; and just as Mr. Smith retires
to his night&rsquo;s rest, our young <i>rou&eacute;</i>, having
recovered from the effects of a good dinner, is ready to commence
the diversions, or, as they may be more fitly termed, the follies
of a night.&nbsp; At a good old age Mr. Smith is gathered to his
fathers, and a tombstone in Norwood Cemetery calls upon the
public to admire those virtues, the loss of which has left such a
blank in the Clapham annals of domestic life.&nbsp; One of Mr.
Smith&rsquo;s companions, a much-maligned individual, has just
written to the <i>Times</i>, indignantly asking if it be nothing
to attend every day at Somerset-house, in wet <!-- page 215--><a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>weather or
fine?&nbsp; But, upon the whole, we think few men were more
fortunate than our deceased friend.&nbsp; Like many of his
schoolfellows, he did not make and lose a fortune; his hair did
not become prematurely grey.&nbsp; There were storms, but they
never reached him.&nbsp; He never missed his church: he had
always a friend, and a bottle to give him; for your true Church
and King man is generally reared on fine old port.&nbsp; His sons
were placed in his office; and his daughters (good-looking, as
most of the daughters of well-to-do, jolly old gentlemen,
generally are) settle comfortably in life.&nbsp; And so endeth
the chapter.</p>
<p>If this imaginary sketch be not true, it is not far from the
truth.&nbsp; A Government situation is known to be a pleasant
berth, and is jumped at as a man would jump at a freehold estate
or a lump of Californian gold.&nbsp; A man who has any influence
with the powers that be, or a younger son, instead of trying a
trade or profession, will often seek a Government situation,
trusting, with the income arising from it, he may live in town
almost in idleness&mdash;at any rate in comparative luxury and
ease.&nbsp; By the side of a Rothschild he may be poor, but
really he is not so badly off, after all.&nbsp; The life of a
Government <i>employ&eacute;</i> is <!-- page 216--><a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>considered
gentlemanly, easy, and not under-paid.&nbsp; Hence the doors of
those who have places to dispose of are furiously besieged by an
eager and avaricious mob.&nbsp; The higher offices are equally
greedily seized, and equally as preposterously over-paid.&nbsp;
During one of the recent examinations before the committee of the
House of Commons, a quondam ambassador had the coolness to inform
the committee that the reason why the American ambassadors
managed to perform their duties for less money than the English
ones was, that they lived so much more economically; as if
economy were a crime, and a thing to be shunned by any of the
numerous representatives of John Bull: and one celebrated
ambassador does not see how diplomacy can be carried on at all
unless the money of the nation be lavished on banquets, such as
even Soyer might envy and admire.</p>
<p>This is the climax of absurdity; and the time has come for
such absurdity to be treated with merited contempt.&nbsp; The axe
must be laid at the root of the tree.&nbsp; A reduction of
salaries commensurate with the increased cheapness of living, and
with the difficulties the tax-payers have in meeting the
tax-gatherers&rsquo; demands, must be <!-- page 217--><a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>made at
once.&nbsp; It is childish to suppose that such a man as Mr.
Bancroft was less respected at Paris than the Marquis of
Normanby, or that Lord Cowley would less powerfully represent
England were his salary of &pound;10,000 cut down to
&pound;2,000.&nbsp; A thoughtful man can see, in the glitter and
glare of gilded saloons, filled with flunkies and worshippers of
the golden calf, nothing very creditable, or worthy of
admiration.&nbsp; At the same time it must be remembered that, if
the nation has efficient service, it is not grudging as regards
expense.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;swinish multitude,&rdquo; as a term of reproach, in
these days of ours is gradually becoming less and less in
vogue.&nbsp; There were times when gentlemen were not ashamed to
use it&mdash;when the people, degraded and oppressed, demoralised
by the vices of their superiors, were scorned for the degradation
which had been forced on them against their will.&nbsp; Not
voluntarily did the people give up its inherent rights and its
divine power.&nbsp; The struggle was long and severe before the
man relinquished his birthright, and sank into a savage or a
sot.&nbsp; The divine in man had to be expelled&mdash;the
instinct in manhood had to be repressed&mdash;conscience had to
be seared&mdash;fatal habits had to be engendered&mdash;ere this
final consummation took place; and kings, with their brute force
and men of war, and with their priests slavish enough
blasphemously to affirm the voice of the king was the voice of
God, found some trouble in effecting it.&nbsp; But they succeeded
in time.&nbsp; They fancied <!-- page 219--><a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>that at
last they had controlled what was as much beyond their control as
the winds of heaven or the ocean&rsquo;s stormy waves.&nbsp; They
thought they had inscribed upon humanity at last the proud
command: &ldquo;Hitherto shalt thou come, but no
further.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor even did the philosopher show himself
above the delusion of the age.&nbsp; Gibbon, in closing his story
of Rome&rsquo;s decline and fall, pitied the future historian,
for whom would exist no parallel passages similar to those which
had lent such thrilling charm to his own eventful page.&nbsp;
Adam Smith calmly predicted the perpetuity of society as it then
was, utterly ignorant of the greatness and the glory yet to
come.&nbsp; Yet hardly was the ink dry which recorded these sage
predictions, when they were singularly falsified.&nbsp; Suddenly,
without one word of warning, without one note of preparation, a
change came as the lightning flash.&nbsp; There was a shaking
amongst the dry bones&mdash;a hurrying to and fro of armed men in
the imperial halls of Versailles.&nbsp; The curls that clustered
on the fair brow of the daughter of the lion-hearted Maria
Theresa in a night became grey.&nbsp; The blood of the heir of a
hundred kings was spilt like water.&nbsp; The storm over, Europe
witnessed a mighty change; old <!-- page 220--><a

passed away, all things had become new: the slavery of the past
was gone; the vain tradition of the elders was laughed to scorn:
the political emancipation of the people as an idea was already
won, and the people&mdash;no longer dumb, inarticulate, without
intellectual life&mdash;conscious of its divine destiny, became
what it is.&nbsp; The clouds of ignorance were dispelled; wisdom
lifted up her voice in the street; knowledge tabernacled on
earth.&nbsp; Hence even the spread of a literature for the
people&mdash;suited to their wants and capacities&mdash;a
literature they can buy, and read, and understand.</p>
<p>Some time back the <i>Times</i> attempted to persuade us that
our cheap shilling volumes were doing us a world of harm.&nbsp;
It was grievously shocked to find that the people bought and read
them, instead of its healthy and stimulating columns.&nbsp; It
thought we were really getting into a very undesirable
state.&nbsp; The <i>Times</i> told us as proof, that we have now
translations of French trashy novels.&nbsp; We admit we have; but
is that anything new?&nbsp; Have we not always had a large class
of readers of trashy novels, French or otherwise? and even here
have we not proof of progress?&nbsp; Have not those very trashy
novels <!-- page 221--><a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>lost the indecency which was their
characteristic at any earlier time?&nbsp; If we remember aright,
Sir Walter Scott states that a lady told him, in looking over
some of the novels which were fashionable in her youth she was
utterly shocked at the grossness which pervaded them, and that in
that respect a most decided improvement had taken place; and is
this nothing? is this not a sign of good?&nbsp; Nor is this the
only sign; our sterling writers&mdash;the classics of our
land&mdash;are all published in a cheap form, so as to suit the
pockets of the people.&nbsp; The literature of the rail even is
not so very bad after all.&nbsp; Much of it is light and
superficial, undoubtedly; nor is this to be wondered at: the
traveller must have something light, or he cannot read at
all.&nbsp; The book that requires thought is not for the rail,
but the quiet study.&nbsp; Your grave scholars, your most painful
divines, now and then put by the dictionary or the commentary,
and read, it may be, the <i>Times</i>.&nbsp; In both the same law
operates.&nbsp; There are occasions when reading for relaxation
is a necessity: that necessity the railway literature of the day
supplies.&nbsp; But why should the <i>Times</i> grow doleful when
it records the fact?&mdash;or rather the half-fact&mdash;for the
whole truth is more cheering.&nbsp; <!-- page 222--><a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>The whole
truth is, that light reading spreads side by side with reading of
real merit&mdash;that the popular scientific discourse, or
history, circulates equally with the novel&mdash;not often so
trashy after all&mdash;for a cheap book must be a good book or it
will not pay; and that the more readers of light literature you
have, the wider is the circle of readers of better books.&nbsp; A
cheap copy of Burns&rsquo; Poem&rsquo;s might be sold at a
profit; we fear a cheap copy of poems by the critic in the
<i>Times</i> would produce a very different result.&nbsp; To
write for the people, a man must write well.&nbsp; The trashy
novel, published in three volumes, with a limited sale will pay;
it would not published in a cheap form.&nbsp; Only a large sale
will remunerate; and a large sale is only the result of some kind
of merit.</p>
<p>For proof of this we refer to Paternoster Row.&nbsp; What the
press is doing we can best learn there.&nbsp; It is not a place
of great pretensions externally, but it has a history, and its
fame reaches to the uttermost ends of the earth.&nbsp;
Paternoster Row is a short, dark, narrow street, running parallel
with Newgate Street and St. Paul&rsquo;s Church Yard.&nbsp;
Originally it was chiefly patronised by mercers, silkmen, and
lacemen.&nbsp; In the reign of <!-- page 223--><a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>Queen Anne
the booksellers moved here from Little Britain, and here, in
spite of a few successful cases of transplantation to the Strand,
or Piccadilly, or Albemarle Street, or Great Marlborough Street,
do they chiefly remain.&nbsp; Here was the printing office of
Henry Samson Woodfall, the printer of the <i>Public
Advertiser</i>, in which appeared the celebrated letters of
Junius.&nbsp; Some of the firms are very old.&nbsp; The
Rivingtons came here in 1710; the Longmans have been here a
century and a quarter; Simpkins and Marshall are dead and gone,
but their enormous business is still carried on under the old
title, and on a magazine day I believe their sales may amount to
three thousand pounds.&nbsp; How great is the business carried on
here is obvious, when we remember that the Messrs.
Longmans&rsquo; own sale of books has amounted to five millions
in one year, and that the annual distribution of books and tracts
by the Religious Tract Society, in 1853, was nearly twenty-six
millions.&nbsp; When Mr. Routledge could pay Sir Bulwer Lytton
&pound;2,000 a year for liberty to publish an eighteen-penny
edition of his novels&mdash;when the same publisher could offer
Mr. Barnum &pound;1,200 for his lectures&mdash;when for one <!--
page 224--><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>edition alone, the illustrated, of Mr. Tennyson&rsquo;s
poems, their publisher, the late Mr. Moxon, could pay
&pound;2,000 to the poet&mdash;when one firm alone could
subscribe for 4,000 copies of Dr. Livingstone&rsquo;s Researches
in Africa&mdash;when the paper duty for last year amounted to no
less a sum than &pound;1,130,683, it is clear that there must be
no little business going on in Paternoster Row.&nbsp; I have
before me the London catalogue of periodicals and newspapers for
the year 1859, and I find that the monthlies are 353, the
quarterlies 64, the newspapers and weekly publications are more
than 200.&nbsp; The British catalogue of books published during
the year 1851, including new editions, reprints, and pamphlets,
has 48 pages, each page containing a list of about 190 works,
thus giving us for that year alone 9,120 publications, not
magazines or newspapers.&nbsp; Most of the books and journals and
magazines thus published find their way into the provinces by
means of Paternoster Row.&nbsp; On a publishing day the scene is
curious and suggestive; the shops of the large wholesale houses
are full, and customers are ranged on one side of the counter in
ranks three or four deep, while on the other are the assistants
toiling like so many slaves; but all the <!-- page 225--><a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>week,
especially in the middle, Paternoster Row is very eager and
active.&nbsp; Each wholesale house has collectors, who go to the
respective publishers for the books ordered.&nbsp; You may meet
them at all hours between Paternoster Row and the West.&nbsp;
Each collector has a long bag on his back filled with books he
has been buying, and a book in his hand which contains entries of
what he requires.&nbsp; Some houses make a charge of five per
cent. for collecting; those who do not do so give their country
clients but a month&rsquo;s credit.&nbsp; The profits of the
London houses are not large; they get 13 copies of a work for 12,
or 26 charged as 25, and then sell them to the trade at their
cost price, 25 per cent. off publishing price.&nbsp; If they are
the publishers as well they have the extra profit of ten per
cent. for publishing.&nbsp; If a book sells to any extent, the
publishers and the trade do well, much better than the poor
author, whose obligations to the trade are not great.&nbsp; Let
me add that the publishers may do an author a little benefit when
they subscribe his book.&nbsp; This is done in the following
manner: the publisher, when he has a new book, sends it round to
the trade, stating the publishing price, and the terms at which
he will <!-- page 226--><a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>supply it to the trade.&nbsp; A
paper is sent round with it for subscriptions; the large houses,
if the book be likely to sell well, subscribe for, in some cases,
2,000 or 3,000 or 4,000 copies, and thus a good sale is secured
at first.&nbsp; The advantage of the subscription is, that the
trade have a quarter&rsquo;s credit, whereas in their usual
transactions they pay cash.&nbsp; This is almost the only
speculative part of the business of the houses that do not
publish on their own account.&nbsp; It is clear that occasionally
they may encumber themselves with a book which does not sell, and
for which there is no demand, but this is very rarely the
case.&nbsp; The gentleman who buys for the house is generally
wide awake, and will not order a single copy more than he thinks
he can sell with advantage, and at once.</p>
<p>Let not my readers go away with the idea that the great
bookselling firms, proud of their traditions, plant themselves
down in Paternoster Row waiting for customers to come.&nbsp;
Their business is no exception to the general rule, which
requires excessive pushing to keep pace with the competition of
rivals.&nbsp; They have travellers in all quarters of the
country&mdash;they publish catalogues and their terms, which are
everywhere <!-- page 227--><a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>disseminated among the
trade&mdash;and an author may be sure that it is not the fault of
the booksellers that he is compelled to sell his crowning work,
rich in graphic colouring, in interesting detail, in noble
thought, in manly eloquence (I quote the author&rsquo;s private
opinion), to Mr. Tegg or the trunk maker.&nbsp; As I have
mentioned Mr. Tegg, let me add, that it is the province of that
gentleman to relieve authors and publishers of works which an
apathetic public do not appreciate and will not buy.&nbsp; If Mr.
Tegg is so fortunate as to purchase the sheets (which he
afterwards binds up in a cheap form) at his own price, and sells
them at the author&rsquo;s, he ought by this time to be as rich
as the Rothschilds or the Marquis of Westminster.&nbsp; What he
does with his bargains, I cannot tell.&nbsp; I see them awhile in
glaring colours, regardless of the suns of summer or winter
snows, adorning the cheap book-stalls of Holborn, or Fleet
Street, or the Strand, charming the eye of the juvenile
population of the metropolis, and offering them the advantages of
a circulating library without the inconvenience.&nbsp; I
occasionally meet them in railway carriages, chiefly (I do not
write it disrespectfully) third class.&nbsp; I have met with them
in considerable <!-- page 228--><a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>numbers in our seaport towns, and
then I miss them and search for them in vain.&nbsp; Where are
they?&nbsp; I believe I am not far wrong in conjecturing that
they are gone where there are</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Larger constellations burning,<br />
Mellow moons, and happy skies;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that they stimulate the intellect or soothe the leisure of
muscular gold-diggers at Ballarat; that pastoral New Zealanders
read them with delight; that they adorn the drawing-rooms of
distant Timbuctoo.&nbsp; Let me say a word for the authors of
these works.&nbsp; Are they not true philanthropists?&nbsp; Not
one book in a hundred pays, yet in what countless succession do
they appear!</p>

<h3>THE LONDON PULPIT,</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">by</span><br />
JAMES EWING RITCHIE.</p>
<p>Contents: The Religious Denominations of London&mdash;Sketches
of the Rev. J. M.
Bellew&mdash;Dale&mdash;Liddell&mdash;Maurice&mdash;Melville&mdash;Villiers&mdash;Baldwin
Brown&mdash;Binney&mdash;Dr.
Campbell&mdash;Lynch&mdash;Morris&mdash;Martin&mdash;Brock&mdash;Howard

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: center">OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The subject is an interesting one, and it is treated
with very considerable ability.&nbsp; Mr. Ritchie has the
valuable art of saying many things in few words; he is never
diffuse, never dull, and succeeds in being graphic without
becoming flippant.&nbsp; Occasionally his strength of thought and
style borders rather too closely on coarseness; but this fault of
vigorous natures is counterbalanced by compensatory
merits&mdash;by an utter absence of cant, a manly grasp of
thought, and a wise and genial human-heartedness.&nbsp; The book
is a sincere book; the writer says what he means, and means what
he says.&nbsp; In these half-earnest days it is a comfort to meet
with any one who has &lsquo;the courage of his opinions,&rsquo;
especially on such a subject as the &lsquo;London
Pulpit.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Daily News</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just the book for the innumerable Religious Book
Clubs, one of which is to be found in every market town and every
considerable village.&nbsp; Perhaps it would have sold more
rapidly but for its &lsquo;exceeding honesty&rsquo; and
impartiality, which, however, in our opinion, are its great
recommendations.&nbsp; Mr. Ritchie is either of no sect, or else
he has attained to such a point of freedom, that though he may be
especially attached to one, he can look with an impartial eye
upon the virtues and failings of all.&nbsp; None but a practised
hand could have succeeded in presenting such generally accurate
portraits with so few strokes of the
pencil.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Illustrated Times</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the cleverest productions of the present
day.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Morning Herald</i>.</p>
<p><!-- page 230--><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>&ldquo;Discriminating in observation, just in verdict,
lofty in its ideal of pulpit excellence, and thoroughly
interesting in style.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Homilist</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ritchie is just the man to dash off a series of
portraits, bold in outline, strikingly like the originals in
feature and expression, and characterised by bright and effectual
colouring.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Civil Service Gazette</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The style of Mr. Ritchie is always lively and fluent,
and oftentimes eloquent.&nbsp; It comes the nearest to
Hazlitt&rsquo;s of any modern writer we know.&nbsp; His views and
opinions are always dear, manly, and unobjectionable as regards
the manner in which they are set forth.&nbsp; Many, no doubt,
will not agree with them, but none can be offended at them.&nbsp;
As we have already remarked, Mr. Ritchie does not write as a
sectarian, and it is impossible to collect from the treatise to
what sect he belongs.&nbsp; The tendency of these sketches is to
introduce into the pulpit a better style of preaching than what
we have been accustomed to.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Critic</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ritchie&rsquo;s pen-and-ink sketches of the popular
preachers of London are as life-like as they are brilliant and
delightful.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Sun</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without going so far as the late Sir Robert Peel, and
saying that there are three ways of viewing this as well as every
other subject, it will be allowed that the clerical body may be
contemplated either from within one of their special folds, and
under the influence of peculiar religious views, or in a purely
lay, historical manner, and, so we suppose we ought to say, from
the &lsquo;platform of humanity&rsquo; at large.&nbsp; The latter
is the idea developed in Mr. Ritchie&rsquo;s volume, and cleverly
and amusingly it is done.&nbsp; One great merit is, that his
characters are not unnecessarily spun out.&nbsp; We have a few
rapid dashes of the pencil, and then the mind is relieved by a
change of scene and person. . . .&nbsp; He displays considerable
discrimination of judgment, and a good deal of
humour.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The Inquirer</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is considerable verisimilitude in these sketches,
though they are much too brief to be regarded as more than mere
outlines.&nbsp; It is possible, however, to throw character even
into an outline, and this is done with good effect in several of
these smart and off-hand
compositions.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Tait</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is lively, freshly written, at times powerful, and
its facts carefully put together.&nbsp; It bears the stamp of an
earnest spirit, eager in its search after truth, and strongly set
against affectation and pretence of every
sort.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Globe</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the sketches are very
good.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Literary Gazette</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would wish for this little volume an attentive
perusal on the part of all to whom inclination or duty, or both,
give an interest in the moral, the social, and the religious
condition of their fellow-men; above all, we should wish to see
it in the hands of bishops, and other ecclesiastical
dignitaries&mdash;of metropolitan rectors and fashionable
preachers&mdash;of statesmen and legislators&mdash;and of that
most mischievous class of men, well-meaning
philanthropists.&nbsp; The picture of life in London, of its
manifold pitfalls of temptation and corruption, which are here
presented to the reader&rsquo;s eye, is truly appalling.&nbsp; No
one can rise from it without a deep conviction that something
must be done, ay, and that soon, if the metropolis of the British
Empire is not to become a modern Sodom and
Gomorrah.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>John Bull</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a matter-of-fact reality about the sketches,
but they are chiefly remarkable for the moral tone of their
reflections.&nbsp; Generally speaking, painters of these subjects
rather throw a purple light over the actual scenes, and say
nothing of the consequences to which they lead; Mr. Ritchie is
ever stripping off the mask of the mock gaiety before him, and
pointing the end to which it must finally
come.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Spectator</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have kept Mr. Ritchie&rsquo;s book lying on our
table, hoping that we might find an opportunity for making it the
basis of an article on the fearful evils which it
discloses.&nbsp; We must be satisfied, however, for the present,
with recommending all our readers who are anxious to promote the
social and moral regeneration of our great cities to read it
carefully; and to remember, while they read, that London does not
<!-- page 232--><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>stand alone, but that all our larger towns are cursed
with abominations, such as those which Mr. Ritchie has so
vigorously and effectually described.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Eclectic
Review</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ritchie is favourably known to us; nor do we think
this little volume will detract from his
reputation.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Daily News</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not ill done in parts, it is not done in a fast spirit
or affectedly; and the moral tone throughout is healthy
enough.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Illustrated London News</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ritchie&rsquo;s sketches are lively and graphic in
style, and convey truthful pictures of some of the dark phases of
London life.&nbsp; His book may be regarded as supplementary to
the Hand-books and Guides of the Metropolis, which lightly touch
upon topics which are here specially described and vigorously
commented on.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Literary Gazette</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ritchie&rsquo;s graphic descriptions, though
painful, may be useful.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Patriot</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ritchie&rsquo;s work merits the attention of
philanthropists and those interested in the education and
improvement of all classes, since it will enable them to see the
land of evil with which they have to deal.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Daily
Telegraph</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ritchie&rsquo;s object is evidently to disclose to
the view of less venturous philanthropists the fountain heads of
the floods of iniquity which overflow large portions of this
population of three millions, and he has fully succeeded.&nbsp;
His array of statistics in the introduction may be made good use
of, and the watchful parent, or zealous minister of religion, the
friends of city missions, or contributors to the press, may
derive much useful information from all the
pages.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Christian Times</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the &lsquo;Night-Side of London&rsquo; Mr. J. Ewing
Ritchie draws a most painful, but, we have reason to believe, not
an over-coloured picture of the fearful temptations which abound
in our great metropolis.&nbsp; The evils which seduce many a
young man from the path of duty, and keep down the poor in their
poverty and degradation, are traced to the love of intoxicating
liquors, and the abundant facilities which are afforded for the
gratification of that fatal passion.&nbsp; Mr. Ritchie writes in
an earnest manner, and his book contains information which
demands the careful consideration of the moralist and the social
reformer.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Inquirer</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The author of &lsquo;The Night-Side of London&rsquo;
has graphically described the scenes of debauchery which are to
be found at night.&nbsp; It is a fearful and shocking
<i>expos&eacute;</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Illustrated Times</i>.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
