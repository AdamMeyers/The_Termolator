PREFACE

The hidden depths both of the wisdom and knowledge of God were manifest, not only in the revelation of his will contained in the Scriptures of truth, but in the manner of giving that revelation, and in the language in which is was given.

Egypt had wisdom, but it was enshrined in hieroglyphics so obscure that their meaning faded centuries ago from the memory of mankind, and for many successive ages no man on earth could penetrate their mysteries. Assyria and Babylon had literature, art, and science; but with a language written in seven or eight hundred cuneiform signs, some of them having fifty different meanings, what wonder is it that for more than two thousand years the language and literature of these nations was lost, buried, and forgotten? The vast literature of China has survived the changes of centuries, but the list of different characters, which in a dictionary of the second century numbered 9353, and in the latest imperial Chinese Dictionary numbers 43,960,       some of them requiring fifty strokes of the pencil to produce them,        shows how unfit such a language must be for a channel to convey the glad tidings of God's salvation to the poor, the weak, the sorrowful, and to people who cannot spend ten or twenty years in learning to comprehend the mysteries of the Chinese tongue.

Who can imagine what would have been the fate of a divine revelation if the words of eternal life had been enswathed in such cerements as these?

In the wisdom of God, the revelation of his will was given in the Hebrew tongue, with an alphabet of twenty-two letters, some of which, as inscribed on the Moabite stone, b.c. 900, are identical in form and sound with those now used in English books.

This Hebrew alphabet, so simple that a child might learn it in a day, has never been lost or forgotten. The Hebrew language in which the Oracles of God were given to man, has never become a dead language. Since the day when the Law was given to Moses on Mount Sinai, there never has been a day or hour when the language in which it was written was not known to living men, who were able to read, write, and expound it. And the Hebrew is the only language of those ages that has lived to the present time, preserving the record of a divine revelation, and being conserved by it through the vicissitudes of conflict, conquest, captivity, and dispersion; while the surrounding idolatrous nations perished in their own corruption, and their languages and literature were buried in oblivion.

In later ages, when the gospel of the Son of God was to be proclaimed to all mankind, another language was used as a vehicle for its communication. The bulk of the Israelitish race, through their captivities and eternal associations, had lost the knowledge of the holy tongue, and had learned the languages of the Gentiles among whom they dwelt; and now as their corporate national existence was to be interrupted, and they were to be dispersed among the peoples of the earth, the Hebrew language was not a fit channel for conveying this revelation to the Gentile world. Hence the same wise Providence which chose the undying Hebrew tongue for the utterances of the prophets, selected the Greek, which was at that time, more nearly than any other, a universal language, as the medium through which the teachings of the Saviour and the messages of the apostles should be sent forth to mankind.

This language, like the Hebrew, has maintained its existence,       though it has been somewhat changed by the flight of years,       and the modern Greek spoken in Athens to-day is substantially the Greek of 1800 years ago.

The gospel of Christ was to go forth to every nation; and the miracle of Pentecost indicated that it was the Divine purpose that each nation should hear in their own tongue wherein they were born, the wonderful works of God. Hence the Scriptures have been translated into hundreds of languages, and to-day six hundred millions of people, comprising all the leading races and nations of the earth, may have access to the Word of God in their native tongues. Nevertheless, no translation can perfectly express the delicate shades of thought which are uttered in another language, and it often becomes necessary and desirable to recur to the original Scriptures, and by searching them to find out the precise meaning of those words which were given by the Holy Ghost, and which are "more to be desired than gold, yea, than much fine gold." For while, speaking in a general way, we have faithful translations, which give us with great accuracy the sense of the Scriptures as a whole, yet there are times when we desire fuller and more accurate information concerning particular words uttered by those men to whom the Holy Ghost was given to bring all things to their remembrance, to guide them into all truth, and to show them things to come. Frequently there are depths of meaning which the casual reader does not fathom, and the study of the Greek and Hebrew becomes as needful as it is agreeable to those who love God's law, who delight in his gospel, and who have time and opportunity to prosecute such studies.

There are few lovers of the Bible who do not at times wish that they might clearly know the precise sense of some one original word which may sometimes be obscurely translated; or who would not be delighted to inquire of some competent scholar as to the meaning of certain expressions contained in that Book of God. Such persons are glad to study the original Scriptures, that they may learn, as far as possible, exactly what God has said to man.

The learning of a living language from those who seek it is no trifling task; but a language which must be learned from books, presents much greater difficulties; and to many persons the mastery of the Greek tongue looks like the labor of a lifetime. It is; and yet it is possible for studious Bible readers to learn the things they specially need to know, with an amount of labor which need not appall or dishearten any diligent student.

There are contained in the Greek New Testament about 5594 words; but in the whole Greek literature the words are a great multitude, which perhaps no man has ever numbered. The student of the Scriptures is not anxious to master or explore this vast wealth of Greek literature, but his ambition is to know something of those 5594 New Testament words in which the message of God's mercy is conveyed to fallen man. Hence he may pass by the bulk of Greek literature, and confine his investigations to those few Greek words which are used in the New Testament to convey to man the treasures of Divine truth.

A lexicon of the entire Greek language might extend through thousands of pages. There stands on the shelves of the writer a copy of Stephen's "Thesaures Gr               Lingu       ," in eight folio volumes, (London, 1816-1825,) which contains more than thirteen thousand large, closely printed pages. A later edition of the same work is still larger; and there are critics and students who would find use for a lexicon as elaborate as this; but for the great mass of Biblical students most of this material would be entirely useless, and a very small volume would contain all they would find necessary in their study of the Scriptures of truth. Thus a portable volume, confining itself to the definition of the words included in the New Testament, could give them fuller treatment than a very large volume which, covering the entire language would be obliged to condense and abridge at every point, omitting perhaps the very matter most desired by a student of the Sacred Word.

There is another consideration; the Greek of the New Testament differs materially in its character from the classical Green, or from the Greek language as a whole.  About b.c. 288, the law of Moses was translated from Hebrew into Greek, by request of Ptolemy Philadelphus, who sought everywhere for books to enrich his great library at Alexandria. Subsequently other portions were translated, and hence, we have what is known as the Septuagint version of the Old Testament. This was largely used among the Jewish people in Egypt and elsewhere in the time of our Saviour. It was a Greek version of a Hebrew book, and it was through this book, as well as by intercourse with Grecian people and foreigners of the Jewish stock, that the Jewish people became acquainted with the Greek tongue. But the Greek of the Septuagint was full of Hebrew ideas and idioms, and hence the Greek of the Jews in Palestine, and of the New Testament which is also saturated with Old Testament ideas, differed from the ordinary language of the Greeks, new meanings having been imparted to various words, in order that they might represent Hebrew words and Hebrew ideas. For example, when the Greek word hades is used, we are not thereby committed to a belief in all the fabulous ideas of the Greeks concerning the abode of the dead, for the word was but the representative of the Hebrew word sheol, which is almost always translated hades in the Greek Testament. Hence in studying this Greek word in the New Testament we are not to go to the Greek classics to find out what they mean by the word hades, but rather to the Hebrew prophets to learn in what sense they use the Hebrew word sheol, of which it is the Greek equivalent. So the word diatheke in classic Greek signifies a will, testament, covenant, and so the term in the common English version is translated in both these ways. But in the Septuagint the word diatheke is used to translate the Hebrew word berith, which signifies a covenant, but does not signify a will or testament.1*  Hence, instead of speaking of "The New Testament" we should more correctly call it the "The New Covenant." A variety of instances might be adduced where New Testament Greek words have meaning widely different from the same words in classic Greek.

It must also be remembered, that there are words in the New Testament which are not found at all in the classical writers. When new ideas are to be conveyed, new words must be found to convey them. In the language of the Hindus there is no word for home, simply because the Hindu has no home. The idea of a home as understood by Christians, is utterly foreign to the Hindu nation and religion. There are heathen nations that have no word for gratitude, because gratitude is unknown to them; so the word agape or charity, which describes unselfish love, a love which reaches to enemies, and which seeks no personal gratification or reward,       that love which is of God, and concerning which it is said, "God is Love," refers to something unknown to the heathen world. They had no word to express it, because they had not the thing itself to express.

These illustrations indicate some of the peculiarities of the New Testament Greek, and serve to show use why the student of the Bible needs an especial apparatus for studying the Greek New Testament.  For this purpose, he has been most generously furnished with New Testament lexicons, in different languages, Latin, German, and English, by the labor of devout and learned students. Among the most noteworthy may be mentioned Robinson's Greek Lexicon of the New Testament, and Prof. J. H. Thayer's later and more elaborate Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament, based upon Prof. Grimm's get Lexicon; which is well adapted to meet the needs of the critical student.

The meaning of words is determined finally by their usage by those who employ them, and the only way to settle the sense of disputed and difficult words is carefully to examine each word in its connection, in all the passages where it is used, and in the light of that examination decide as to its meaning or meanings. In some of the more elaborate lexicons a large number of passages are thus cited, illustrating the use of the words under consideration, and it some cases authors have endeavored to give nearly every passage where a word occurs in the New Testament. This however, cumbers the lexicon with a large amount of material which in most instances is of little use. This examination and comparison of passages, the careful student should make for himself, and his interests in this direction are better served by the use of a concordance; and for those who wish to investigate carefully the meaning of Greek words in the New Testament, ample provision has been made in the Critical Greek and English Concordance, prepared by Prof. C. F. Hudson, under the direction of H. L. Hastings, and revised and completed by the late Ezra Abbot, D.D., LL.D., Profession of New Testament Criticism and Interpretation in the Divinity School of Harvard University.

This book contains (1) the more than five thousand words in the Greek Testament, in alphabetical order. (2) Reference to every passage where those words occur. (3) Every English word which is used to translate the given Greek word. (4) The passages in which the Greek word is translated by each English word, classified and set by themselves, so that the more usual translations are also exhibited. (5) The various readings of the leading critical editions and manuscripts of the Greek Testament. (6) An English index, so that with this book a person who does not know a letter of the Greek alphabet is enabled to find the original for any English word in the New Testament, learn in how many places it occurs, and in how many ways it is translated, so that by examining every passage, he may have the data before him for making up and independent judgment from the facts in the case.

This Greek Concordance obviates the necessity for an exhaustive citation of the passages containing any particular Greek word, and brings us back to the proper sphere of a Lexicon, as a book defining the words contained in the language, with occasional references to passages which illustrate the different meanings; and when equipped with Hudson's Concordance, a manual lexicon of New Testament Greek serves the purpose of the ordinary student.

It is for the accommodation of such students, who know little of the Greek language, but who desire to "search the Scriptures," and of others more scholarly, who yet find it needful to refresh their memories as to the sense of Greek words, that this Lexicon is offered. It was originally prepared by William Greenfield, who was born in London, in 1799, and died there November 5, 1831. He edited Bagster's Comprehensive Bible, a Syriac New Testament, a Hebrew New Testament, and prepared an abridgement of Schmidt's Greek Concordance. In 1830 he was appointed editor of the Foreign Versions of the British and Foreign Bible Society; and though he died at an early age, he had a high reputation as an accomplished linguist.

In preparing his Lexicon of the New Testament, he drew materials from every accessible source; the Lexicons of Parkhurst, Schleusner, Wahl, and Robinson being especially examined and laid under contribution. This Lexicon, issued by Bagster       Sons as a companion for a portable edition of the Greek Testament, served an excellent purpose. At a later date it was carefully revised with numerous additions and improvements, by Rev. Thomas Sheldon Green, M.A. and it has received the hearty approval of competent Greek scholars, like the late Professor Ezra Abbot of Cambridge.

Though the body of this Lexicon includes all the words contained in the Received Text of the Greek New Testament, yet in the texts now more or less current, in particular those of Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles, Westcott and Hort, and the Westminster Revised, certain new words and forms are introduced, not found in the Received Text.

With a desire to give completeness to this Lexicon, a list of these words is presented, with definitions and a record of the places where they occur, at the end of the Lexicon. This list has been prepared by Mr. Wallace N. Stearns, under the supervision of Prof. J. Henry Thayer, of Harvard Divinity School, the successor of the lamented Dr. Ezra Abbot, and one of the revisers of the New Testament, whose arduous labors in the department of sacred lexicography are too well-known to need further mention.

With these statements as to the object and character of this Lexicon, we commit this new edition to the kind of providence of Him whose words of truth are therein expounded, and without whose blessings all labor and effort is but in vain.                               H.L. Hastings

EXPLANATIONS


Allusion has been made in the preface to certain peculiarities of New Testament Greek, which distinguish it from the classic Greek of the heathen world.
This Lexicon indicates some of these peculiarities, by distinguishing three classes of words:
I. Later Greek words, marked L. G., the occurrence of which may be regarded as commencing within the Later Greek period, which is here reckoned from and includes the writing of the historian Polybius, B.C. 204-123.
II. New Testament words, marked N. T., which only occur in the New Testament, or if found elsewhere are only in certain peculiar quarters.
III. Septuagint words, marked S., which besides their occurrence in the New Testament are found only in the Septuagint Version of the Old Testament, the Greek Apocryphal books, and kindred writings; and the meaning of which is to be studied, not in the usage of classical Greek writings, but rather in the light of the Hebrew Old Testament, and the writings of Jewish authors who were familiar with Hebrew ideas and Hebrew literature.

Foot notes:


1*Both the Authorized and the Revised Versions of Heb. ix. 15-16 give countenance to the assumption that our Saviour made his last will and testament, and by his death gave it validity. But in that case would not his resurrection three days later, have rendered it null and void? The subject under discussion in Hebrews ix. is not two testaments or wills, but two covenants or agreements; and the death referred to seems to be not the death of a "testator," or mediator but the death of the sacrifice which was offered after the custom of ancient times when a solemn covenant was made, and whose blood sprinkled on the ground and over the covenanting parties, sealed the covenant, which was of no force until the sacrifice was slain. The first covenant was sealed with the blood of calves and goats; the second covenant with the blood of the Son of God. Heb. ix. 15-26; xiii. 20; Exod. xxiv. 4-8; Gen. xv. 8-18; Mark xiv. 24. He was not only the mediator of the new covenant, but also the sacrifice which sealed it, all types combining in Him. For an extended discussion of this subject, consulting Macknight on The Epistles, and Granville Penn's Notes on The New Covenant. Heb. ix. 15-16.


      


TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:

The first and most obvious change from the original printed publication
is that the dual column layout has been abandoned and replaced with a single column
layout. This was done with the aim of making scrolling through the content easier.

Since no table of contents was provided in the printed publication,
a small hyperlinked table has been added to allow for direct access to each
letter of the Greek alphabet in both the Main Lexicon and the Supplement to the Lexicon
sections.

The Main Lexicon term entries have a light blue background while the Supplement
term entries have a light yellow background. This is to assist visually in determining
which section a hyperlink has moved the reading into or out of.

The automatic numbering of each lexical entry within an alphabetic section
has been inserted to facilitate cross-referencing terms and hyperlinked roots throughout
this ebook document.  NOTE: For those readers who might be familiar with the
Strong Concordance cross-reference numbering system used in that publication
(and many others), the numbering used here is NOT related in any way.
NOTE 2: For web browsers or reading systems that do not support this function,
no real functionality is lost.

In the original publication, many hundreds of hard and soft "breathing" marks
seem to have been truncated during the printing process for words beginning with vowels.
The transcriber has painstakingly researched each missing entry and restored the
missing diacritical mark.
Due to the volume of this restoration, a listing of each is not provided here.

All hyperlinks contained within the ebook were producted by the transcriber and he takes
full responibility for any missing or misdirected links.  All linkage is within in single document
file and no external links are contained herein.

Feedback on content, layout, or hyperlinks may be directed to sbridgeford02@hotmail.com

Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
