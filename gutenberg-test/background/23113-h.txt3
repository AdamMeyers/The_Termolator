PREFACE.

The following pages do not appear to need
any extended preface; their topic is set
forth in the first lines of the first chapter.
With what success it has been handled is
another matter.

But as a writer reviews his own words, it is
inevitable that some sort of envoi should present
itself to his mind. In this case the envoi seems
to me to be the vital necessity of personal
holiness in the Christian Minister, in order to
the right working of the Christian Ministry;
a personal holiness which shall be no mere
form moulded from without but a life developed
into manifestation and action from within.

Never did the Church of Christ more need
to remember this than at the present day.[Pg&nbsp;viii]
The strongest surface currents of the age are
against it; alike that of unregulated, hurrying,
indiscriminate enterprize, and that of an exaggerated
ecclesiasticism. In the one case the
worker's communion with God tends to be
sacrificed to the work, the fountain choked
for the sake of the stream. In the other case
there is a serious risk that "the Church" may
come to be regarded as an almost substitute
for the Lord in matters affecting the life and
growth of the Christian man, and of course of
the Christian Minister. Sacred are the claims
of order and cohesion, but more sacred and
more vital still is the call to the individual constituent
of the community to come to the living
Personal Christ, "nothing between," and to
abide in innermost intercourse with Him, and
to draw every hour by faith on His great
grace.

If these simple pages may at all, in His
most merciful hands, promote the holy cause
of such a hidden life and its fruitful issues,
it will indeed be happiness to the writer. In[Pg&nbsp;ix]
these days of stifling materialism in philosophy,
and withering naturalism in theology, but in
which also the Holy Spirit, far and wide, is
breathing upon us in special mercy from above,
there is no duty more pressing on the Christian
than to seek, in the world of work, after that
life which is "lived in the flesh by faith in the
Son of God," and which is manifested in the
strong and patient "meekness of wisdom."

Ridley Hall, Cambridge,
April 22nd, 1892.



[Pg&nbsp;x]

Servant of God, be fill'd
With Jesu's love alone;
Upon a sure foundation build,
On Christ the corner-stone;
By faith in Him abide,
Rejoicing with His saints;
To Him with confidence, when tried,
Make known all thy complaints."

Moravian Hymn-book.

"The Interpreter had Christian into a private Room, and bid
his Man open a Door; the which when he had done, Christian
saw a Picture of a very grave Person hang up against the Wall,
and this was the fashion of it: It had eyes lift up to Heaven,
the best of Books was in its hand, the Law of Truth was written
upon its lips, the World was behind his back; it stood as if it

CHAPTER I.CONTENTS

THE SECRET WALK WITH GOD (i.).

[Pg&nbsp;2]

Pastor, for the round of toil
See the toiling soul is fed;
Shut the chamber, light the oil,
Break and eat the Spirit's bread;
Life to others would'st thou bring?
Live thyself upon thy King.

[Pg&nbsp;3]

Let me explain in this first sentence that
when in these pages I address "my
Younger Brethren," I mean brethren in the
Christian Ministry in the Church of England.
Let me limit my reference still further, by
premising that very much of what I say will be
said as to brethren who have lately taken holy
Orders, and are engaged in the work of
assistant Curacies.

AIM OF THE BOOK.

Day by day, for many years past, my life
has lain among men preparing themselves for
just that work. As a matter of course my
thoughts have run incessantly in that direction.
Many a lecture in the library where we work
together, and many a conversation in dining-hall,
or by study fire, or in college garden, or
on country road, has given point to those
thoughts and enabled me, I trust, better to[Pg&nbsp;4]
understand my younger Brethren, and with
more sympathy to make myself, as an elder
brother, understood by them. What I here
seek to do, with the gracious aid of our
blessed Master, is somewhat to extend the
range of such talks, and to ask a friendly
hearing from younger Brethren in the holy
Ministry with whom I have never had the
opportunity of speaking personally.

I have not the least intention of writing a
treatise on the Christian Pastorate. To talk
to young Christian Ministers about some important
details of pastoral life and work, but
above all of life, inward and outward&mdash;this is
my simple purpose.



THREE LINES OF PRAYER.

One day in each week, at Ridley Hall, we
unite in special prayer, without liturgical form,
for those members of the Hall who have gone
out into actual ministry. As I lead my dear
younger Brethren in that supplication, the
heart feels itself full of many, very many, well-remembered
faces, characters, lives. It seems
to see those many old friends scattered abroad
in the Lord's work-field; and it sees, of course,[Pg&nbsp;5]
a very large variety among them, in the way
of both character and circumstances. But,
with all this consciousness of differences, my
thoughts and my petitions always, by a deep
necessity, run for all alike along three main
paths. The first prayer is for the young
Clergyman's inner and secret Life and Walk
with God. The second is for his daily and
hourly general Intercourse with Men. The
third is for his official Ministrations of the
Word and Ordinances of the Gospel. And in
all these directions, after all, one desire, one
prayer, has to be offered, the prayer that everywhere
and always, from the inmost recesses of
life to its largest and most public circumference,
the Lord and Master may take, and keep,
full possession of the servant. I pray that in
secret devotion, and in secret habits, Jesus
Christ may be intensely present with the man;
and that in common intercourse, in all its parts,
He may be the constant and all-influencing
Companion, to stimulate, to control, to chasten,
to gladden, to empower; and that in the
preaching of the Word the servant may really
and manifestly speak from, and for, and in, his[Pg&nbsp;6]
Lord; and that in ministration of the sacramental
and other Ordinances he may truly
and unmistakably walk before Him in holy
simplicity, holy reverence, and full spiritual
reality, "serving the Lord," and serving
the flock, "with all humility of mind." [Acts xx. 19.]

My present talks on paper will take very
much the lines of these prayers. Secret walk
with God, common and general walk with men,
special ministrations&mdash;I desire to say a little on
each and all of these points, and more or less
in this order, though without attempting too
rigid an arrangement, where one subject must
often run over into another.



SECRET WALK WITH GOD.

Let me take up the first great topic of the
three for a few preliminary words in this
chapter: The Secret Walk with God of the
young Pastor of Christ's flock.

HINDRANCES: WORK.

My brotherly reader will not need any long
explanation or careful apology from me here.
He knows as well as I do, on the one hand,
that a close secret walk with God is unspeakably
important in pastoral life, and, on the
other hand, that pastoral life, and not least in[Pg&nbsp;7]
its early days, is often allowed to hinder or
minimize the real, diligent work (for it is a
work indeed in its way) of that close secret
walk. He finds all too many possible interferences
with the inner working on the part
of the outer. Such interferences come from
very different quarters. The new Curacy, the
new duties and opportunities, if the man has
his heart in his ministry, will prove intensely
interesting, and at first, very possibly, encouragement
and acceptance may predominate
over experiences of difficulty and trial. Services,
sermons, visits to homes and to schools,
with all the miscellanies that attend an active
and well-ordered parochial organization&mdash;these
things are sure to have a special and exciting
interest for most young men who have taken
Orders in earnest. And it will be almost inevitable
that the Curate, under even the most
wise, considerate, and unselfish of Incumbents,
should find "work" threatening rapidly to
absorb so much, not of time only but thought
and heart, that the temptation is to abridge and
relax very seriously indeed secret devotion,
secret study of Scripture, and generally secret[Pg&nbsp;8]
discipline of habits, that all-important thing.

*HINDRANCES: SOLITUDE.

Then, on the other hand, there is a risk and
trial from a region quite opposite. The Curate
comes to his new work, and takes up his abode
in lodgings&mdash;alone. Only a few months ago,
perhaps only a few weeks ago, he was in rooms
at College, amidst all the social as well as
mental interests of University life, and (so it is,
thank God, for many University men now)
feeling on every side the help of Christian
friendship and fellowship of the warmest and
truest sort. And now, socially and as to
fellowship in Christ, he is, to speak comparatively,
alone. I say, comparatively. Very
likely he has found in his Incumbent a friend
and elder brother, perhaps a friend and loving
father, in the Lord. And most probably he
will find among his people, and that very soon
if he is on the watch, friends in Christ, gentle or
simple. He may be associated with a brother
Curate or Curates; and if so, the inmost aim
of both or all ought to be, and in most cases
will be, not only to work in the same parish
but to work heart to heart as "in Him."
Nevertheless, the Vicar or Rector, though a[Pg&nbsp;9]
friend, is a very busy friend; and so is the
brother Curate; and the Christian friend in
the parish is after all only one of the many
souls to whom the man has to minister, and
he must not forget those who perhaps need
him most just because they are least congenial
to him.

*ITS DANGERS.

So the sense of change, of solitude,
in such part of his life as is spent indoors, may
be, and, as I know, very often is, real and deep,
sad and sorrowful, and in itself not wholesome,
to the young Minister of Christ. Possibly
my reader knows nothing of all this; but I
think it more likely that at least he knows
something of it. And it needs his prompt and
watchful dealing if it is not to hurt him greatly.
Solitude will not by itself, if I judge rightly,
help him to secret intercourse with God. A
feeling of solitude, under most circumstances,
much more tends, by itself, to drive a man
unhealthily inward, in unprofitable questionings
and broodings, or in still less happy exercises
of thought. Or it drives him unhealthily outward,
quickening the wish for mere stimulants
and excitements of mind and interest. Aye,
let me not shrink from saying it, it sometimes[Pg&nbsp;10]
quickens a wish for "stimulants" in the most
literal sense of the word. Exhausting and multifarious
parochial work, and the lonely bachelor
quarters at the day's end, have brought to many
a young man sore temptations of that sort, and
sometimes they have won the battle, to the
wreck and ruin of the work and of the worker.

HINDRANCES ARE OCCASIONS.

Well, all these facts or possibilities are just
so many reminders that the new Curate's life
will not, of itself, greatly help him to maintain
and quicken his Secret Walk with God, that
vital necessity for his work. It certainly will
not do so directly; it will, directly, be a problem,
not an aid. But on that very account,
dear Brother and reader, your new conditions
of life may prove indirectly a most powerful
aid, by being a constant and urgent occasion.
As you are a Minister of Christ, your life and
work will, in the Lord's sight, be a failure, yes,
I repeat it, a failure, be the outside and the
reputation what they may, if you do not walk
with God in secret. But therefore your life
and work are a daily and hourly occasion for
the positive resolve, in His Name, that walk
with Him you will. Recognize the risks, right[Pg&nbsp;11]
and left, the risks brought by pastoral activities
and interests, and those brought by pastoral
loneliness and uncheerfulness. Remember the
vital necessity amidst those risks. And then
you will the more deliberately purpose and
plan how to guard your secret devotions, and
how to order your secret hours even when
devotion is not your direct duty, so that your
Lord shall be indeed there, at the centre, "a
living, bright Reality" to you.

SECRET DEVOTION.

Let me plunge into the midst at once, with
a few simple suggestions on Secret Devotion.

LET IT BE DELIBERATE.

I ask my younger Brother, then, to keep
sacred, with all his heart and will, an unhurried
time alone with the Lord, night and morning
at the least. I do not intrusively prescribe a
length of time. But I do most earnestly say
that the time, shorter or longer, must be deliberately
spent; and even ten minutes can be
spent deliberately, while mismanagement may
give a feeling of haste to a much longer season.
Do not, I beseech you, minimize the minutes;
seek for such a fulness of "the Spirit of grace
and of supplications," [Zech. xii. 10.] as shall draw
quite the other way. But if the time, any[Pg&nbsp;12]
given night or morning, must be short, let it
nevertheless be a time of quiet, reverent, collected
worship and confession and petition.
One thing assuredly you can do: you can, if
you will, secure a real "Morning Watch" before
your day's work begins. I do not say it is
easy. Young men very commonly sleep sounder
and longer than we seniors do; they are not
always easy to rouse in a moment. But they
can direct some of their energy to contrive
against themselves, or rather for themselves,
how to secure a regular early rising to meet
their Lord. Most ingenious, not to say amusing,
are some of the devices which friends of mine
have confided to me; schemes and stratagems
to get themselves well awake in good time.
But after all, in most lodging-houses surely
it must be possible to be called early, and to
instruct the caller to show no mercy at the
chamber door. Anyhow, I do say that the
fresh first interview with the all-blessed Master
must at all costs be secured. Do not be beguiled
into thinking it can be arranged by a
half-slumbering prayer in bed. Rise up&mdash;if but
in loving deference to Him. Appear in the[Pg&nbsp;13]
presence chamber as the servant should who
is now ready for the day's bondservice in all
things but in this, that he has yet to take the
day's oath of obedience, and to ask the day's
"grace sufficient," and to read the day's
promises and commands, at the Master's holy
feet.

A PRACTICAL SUGGESTION.

I do not recommend an unpractical physical
mortification as the rule for such early hours
with God. Fully believing that there is a place
for definite "abstinence" in the Christian (and
certainly in the ministerial) life, I do not think
that that place is, as a rule, the early morning
hour. Very many men only procure a bad
headache for the day by beginning any sort of
earnest mental effort without food. Such men
should take care accordingly to eat a chotee
h&aacute;zaree (as old Indians say), "a little breakfast,"
however little, before they pray and read.
There are appliances, simple and inexpensive,
by which the man in lodgings can, without
giving any one trouble, provide himself with
his cup of cocoa or coffee as soon as he is up;
and he will be wise to do something of this
sort, if he is a man whose work by day is[Pg&nbsp;14]
heavy for both body and spirit, and who is
thus specially apt to find the truth of what
doctors tell us, that "sleep is, in itself, an
exhausting process."

But at any cost, my dear friend and Brother
in the Ministry, we must have our Morning
Watch with God, in prayer and in His Word,
before all the day's action. Not even the
earliest possible Church service can rightly take
the place of that.

GOOD HOURS AT NIGHT.

It is obvious to add that punctuality and
early hours in the morning will bring into your
life another rule; that of punctuality and reasonably
good hours at night. No temptation is
greater, sometimes, for the man alone than to
ignore or break such a rule. And no doubt
the exigencies of pastoral life, sometimes, but
surely not often, make it hard to keep it. But
it is extremely important, for the man who
would walk closely and humbly with his God,
to end the day deliberately at His feet. And
here accordingly is another occasion for watchfulness,
and for method, and for will. Do not
drift into the night. Have a settled hour
when, as a habit, you lay interests and intercourse[Pg&nbsp;15]
of other sorts down, and turn unhurried
to the holy interview, spreading open your
Bible by the lamp, the Bible marked and scored
with signs of past research, and then kneeling,
or standing, or pacing, for your prayer&mdash;your
prayer which is to be the very simplest (while
most reverent) speech with the Lord.

PRAY AS A PRIVATE CHRISTIAN.

In such acts of worship, morning and night,
thought for others, for dear ones, for parishioners,
for colleagues, will have its full place
of course. Let it be so, with an ever-growing
sense of the preciousness of the work of intercession.
But I do meanwhile say to my
Brother in Christ, take care that no pre-occupation
with things pastoral allows you to forget
the supreme need of drawing out of Christ's
fulness, and out of the treasures of His Word,
for your own soul and life, as if that were the
one and solitary soul and life in existence. We
Clergy are in danger of becoming too official,
too clerical, even in our prayers. We are the
Lord's Ministers; we have a cure and charge
of souls as the unordained Christian has not;
and let us daily remember it, humbly and reverently.
But also we are, all the while, sheep of[Pg&nbsp;16]
the flock, absolutely dependent on the Shepherd,
men who for their own souls' acceptance,
and holiness, and heaven, must for themselves
"live at the Fountain." We have to serve
others, and "lay ourselves out" for them, daily
and hourly. But on that very account, that
"our selves" may be, if I may say so, worth
the laying out, we must see that "our selves"
are, in their own innermost life and experience,
filled with the Spirit of God, filled with the
presence of an indwelling Lord Jesus Christ by
the Spirit. And so we must worship Him,
and draw on Him, and abide in Him, and
acquaint ourselves with Him, just as if there
were no flock at all, that we may the better be
of use to the flock.

LIVE BEHIND YOUR MINISTRY.

I am sure that this is an important point for
the thought and practice of the young Clergyman.
While never really forgetting his ordained
character, let him, for the very purposes
of his ordained work, continually "live behind"
not only the work but the character; living in
the presence, in the love, in the life, of his
Lord and Head, simply in the character of the
redeemed sinner, the personal believer, the[Pg&nbsp;17]
glad younger Brother of the glorious Firstborn,
the living Christian with the living
Christ; "knowing whom he has believed," [2 Tim. i. 12.]
and walking by faith in Him.

FOR THE MINISTRY'S SAKE.

Do you so live, by His grace and mercy?
Is the sitting-room and the bedroom of your
curacy-lodging the place where you habitually
hold intercourse in this holy simplicity with
Him who has loved you and given Himself for
you? Then I venture to say that all the more
for this, by that same grace and mercy, you
shall be enabled to "lay yourself out" for
others, in your pastoral charge. You shall
understand other men better, by thus securing
for your own soul a deeper understanding of
the Lord Jesus and a fuller sympathy (if the
word is reverent) with Him. I hardly care
to analyze how, but somehow, you shall more
readily and closely "get at" men through this
direct, simple, unofficial, unclerical drawing very
near indeed to God in Christ. The more you
know Him thus at first-hand the more shall
you understand alike the needs of the human
heart (of which all individual hearts are but
various instances), and the supplies that are[Pg&nbsp;18]
laid up for all its needs in Him. And so
you shall go out among your people armed,
equipped, with a truly heaven-given sympathy
and tact. True personal intercourse with the
Lord, the very closest and deepest, is the very
thing to open the whole man out for others,
and to teach him how, with a loving intuition,
to look into them and "upon their things." [Phil. ii. 4.]

A HYMN.

In the next Chapter I shall speak a little
more about the young Clergyman's secret
devotion, and secret study of the heavenly
Word. But enough for the present. And
let me close with the quotation of a hymn,[1] a
new friend of mine, but already a very dear
one, and thankfully added to the treasures
of memory. It puts in the simplest form
possible, while in a form most beautiful, the
vital truth that "intercourse with God is
the power for holy service." Happy the
young Clergyman whose secret daily life, from
its beginning in the "Morning Watch," on[Pg&nbsp;19]
through the intercourse and energies of the
day, up to the evening hour of weariness and
repose, is a translation into experience of that
blessed hymn.

[1] By G.M. Taylor: Hymns of Consecration and Faith
(Second Edition), No. 349.



"TELL HIM ALL."

"When thou wakest in the morning,
Ere thou tread the untried way
Of the lot that lies before thee
Through the coming busy day;
Whether sunbeams promise brightness,
Whether dim forebodings fall,
Be thy dawning glad or gloomy,
Go to Jesus&mdash;tell Him all!

"In the calm of sweet communion
Let thy daily work be done;
In the peace of soul out-pouring
Care be banish'd, patience won
And if earth with its enchantments
Seek thy spirit to enthral,
Ere thou listen, ere thou answer&mdash;
Turn to Jesus&mdash;tell Him all!

"Then, as hour by hour glides by thee,
Thou wilt blessed guidance know;
Thine own burthens being lighten'd,
Thou canst bear another's woe;
Thou canst help the weak ones onward;
Thou canst raise up those that fall;
But, remember, while thou servest,
Still tell Jesus&mdash;tell Him all![Pg&nbsp;20]

"And if weariness creep o'er thee
As the day wears to its close,
Or if sudden fierce temptation
Bring thee face to face with foes&mdash;
In thy weakness, in thy peril,
Raise to heaven a truthful call;
Strength and calm for every crisis
Come&mdash;in telling Jesus all."



[Pg&nbsp;21]

CHAPTER II.CONTENTS

THE SECRET WALK WITH GOD (ii).

[Pg&nbsp;22]

He that would to others give
Let him take from Jesus still;
They who deepest in Him live
Flow furthest at His will.

[Pg&nbsp;23]
I resume the rich subject of Secret Devotion,

Secret Communion with God. Not
that I wish to enter in detail on either the
theory or the practice of prayer in secret; as I
have attempted to do already in a little book
which I may venture here to mention, Secret
Prayer. My aim at present, as I talk to my
younger Brethren in the Ministry, is far rather
to lay all possible stress on the vital importance
of the habit, however it may prove best in
individual experience to order it in practice.
"As a man thinketh in his heart, so
is he"; [Prov. xxiii. 7.] and as a life worketh in its heart, so
is it. And the heart of a Christian Minister's
life is the man's Secret Communion with
God.

Let us Clergymen take as one of our mottoes[Pg&nbsp;24]
that deeply suggestive word of the Lord by
Malachi, where the ideal Levi is
depicted: "He walked with Me in peace and
equity, and did turn many away from iniquity." [Mal. ii. 6.]

THE LORD'S EXAMPLE.

Remember with what a heavenly brightness
that principle was glorified in the recorded life
on earth of "the great Shepherd of
the sheep," [Heb. xiii. 20.] who in this also "left us an
example, that we should follow His
steps." [1 Pet. ii. 22.] Never did man walk more genuinely
with men than the Son of Man, whether it was
among the needy and wistful crowds in streets
or on hill-sides, or at the dinner-table of the
Pharisee, or in the homes of Nazareth, Cana,
and Bethany. No Christian was ever so
"practical" as Jesus Christ. No disciple
ever so directly and sympathetically "served
his own generation by the will of
God" [Acts xiii. 36.] as did the blessed Master. But all the
while "His soul dwelt apart" in the Father's
presence, and there continually rested and was
refreshed, [John iv. 32, 34.] and there found the "meat"
in the strength of which He travelled that
great pilgrimage by way of the Cross to the
Throne. Jesus Christ, our Exemplar as well[Pg&nbsp;25]
as our Life, did indeed live behind His work,
behind His ministry, behind His ministerial
character, in the region of a Filial Communion
in which His Father was His all in all for peace
and joy, His law of action and His eternal
secret of life. And observe, this
habitual communion in the midst of active
service did not at all supersede in His blessed
experience the stated and definite work of
worship and petition before and after the busy
hours of service. "He was alone, praying"; [John vi. 57.]
"He continued all night in prayer
to God"; and at last, "He was
withdrawn from them about a stone's cast,
and kneeled down and prayed." [Luke ix. 18; vi. 12; xxii. 41.]

All this is not only matter for wondering
notice, as we read our New Testament. It is
example, it is model. The Head is thus showing
His members the way, the only way, to
maintain a life among men and for men which
shall be full of good for them, because itself
ever filled with the life and presence of God.

TESTIMONY OF LUCIUS VON MACHTHOLF.

From a leaflet which came long ago into
my hands, I quote the experience of a German
Christian, eminently successful in spiritual work;[Pg&nbsp;26]
a passage which will illustrate and bring home
my appeal in this whole matter:&mdash;

"When Lucius von Machtholf was asked
how he carried on religious intercourse with
individuals, he wrote:&mdash;'I know no other tactics
than first of all to be heartily satisfied with my
God, even if He should favour me with no
sensible visible blessing in my vocation. Also
to remember that preaching and conversation
are not so much my work as the outcome of
the love and joy of the Holy Ghost in my
heart, and, afterwards, on my lips. Further,
that I must never depend upon any previous
fervour or prayers of mine, but upon God's
mercy and Christ's dearly-purchased rights and
holy intercession; and cherishing a burning
love to Christ and to souls, I must constantly
seek for wisdom and gentleness.... Finally,
I would guard myself from imagining that I
know beforehand what I should say, but go to
Christ for every good word I have to speak,
even to a child, and submit myself to the Holy
Spirit, as the Searcher of hearts, who, knowing
the individuals I have to do with, will guide
and teach me when, where, and how to speak.
[Pg&nbsp;27]
"'Be always following, never going before.
It were better to be sick in a tent under a
burning sun, and Jesus sitting at the tent door,
than to be enchanting a thousand listeners
where Jesus was not. Be as a day-labourer
only in God's harvest-field, ready to be first
among the reapers in the tall corn, or just to
sit and sharpen another's sickle. Have an eye
to God's honour, and have no honour of your
own to have an eye to. Lay it in the dust and
leave it there. Never let your inner life get
low in your search for the lives of others.'"

I dare to say that this quotation contains no
mere "counsels of perfection," but principles
which are indispensable for the Minister of
Jesus Christ who would be not only reputable,
popular, and in the superficial sense of the
word successful, but&mdash;what his dear Master
would have him be for His work. And the
blessed spirit it suggests and exemplifies is a
thing which cometh not in "but by prayer"
and by at least such fasting as takes the shape
of a most watchful secret self-discipline. When
von Machtholf speaks of "never depending on
previous prayers" it is obvious what he means;[Pg&nbsp;28]
not that prayer should not precede work, but
that nothing should satisfy the worker short of
a living and present trust in a living and present
Lord. But that trust is the very thing which
is developed, and prepared, and matured, in the
life of genuine secret intercourse, in which the
Lord is dealt with as man dealeth with his
friend, and gazed upon and (I may reverently
say) studied in His revealed Character, till the
disciple does indeed "know whom he has believed,"
"who He is that he should
believe on Him." "My soul shall
be satisfied ... when I remember Thee, when
I meditate on Thee, in the night watches," [2 Tim. i. 12; John ix. 36;
Ps. lxiii. 5, 6.] aye, and in the Morning Watch also.

URGENT PRESENT NEED TO MAINTAIN SECRET DEVOTION.

I know not how to get away from this subject;
not only because of its intense connexion
with the most blissful experiences of the believing
soul, but because of its unspeakably
important bearing on the work of the Ministry,
the Ministry of our own time and of my reader's
own generation. Never was there a period
when the cry for enterprize and practical energy
was louder; and God knows there is occasion
enough for the cry, and for the answering[Pg&nbsp;29]
resolve. But never was there a time when the
need was greater to distinguish true from false
secrets of energy, and to be content with nothing
short of the deepest and most divine as our
ultimate secret. Do you not well know what
I mean? Is there not far and wide in the
"Christian world"&mdash;I do not speak now of the
exterior regions of avowed scepticism or indifference&mdash;a
tendency to merge the whole idea
of religion in that of philanthropic benevolence,
and thereby to draw inevitably the idea of
philanthropy downward in the end into its least
noble manifestations? Is it not a fashionable
thing to regard the Christian Ministry, for
example, as a useful and ready mechanism
with which to work out the social and sanitary
amelioration of the lives of the multitude, and
so to take him to be the best qualified Clergyman
who is, perhaps, the most "muscular" of
Christians, or the cleverest at the invention or
superintendence of recreations on a large scale,
or the quickest student and exponent of the
principles or theories of political economy, or
possibly of socialistic enterprize? But all this
may leave entirely out the very life-blood of[Pg&nbsp;30]
what the New Testament means by the Gospel
of the grace of God; and in many, many cases
it does entirely leave it out.

*"NATURALISM" IN CHRISTIAN WORK.

A conception
of "Church work" is widely entertained, and
thought to be adequate, out of which is practically
dropped all the mystery, and all the
mercy; above all, the work and message of
the atoning Cross and the dying Lamb; and
the need of the sovereign grace of the Holy
Ghost to begin and carry out the Regeneration
of the soul; and the depth of our Fall; and
the offered greatness and splendour of our New
Creation; and "that blessed hope, the glorious
appearing of the great God and our
Saviour Jesus Christ." [Tit. ii. 13.] It is just one wave
of the great anti-supernatural tide of our time.
Christian work is viewed as much as possible
as man's work for man in this present world,
under the example, doubtless, of the beneficent
life of our Lord, but not under the shadow of
Calvary, nor in the light of Pentecost, nor in
the definite prospect of an immortality of holy
glory.

HOW TO COUNTERACT IT.

To counteract this tendency, and to do so
in the right way, is one of the very noblest[Pg&nbsp;31]
tasks set before the younger Clergy of the
English Church in our time. It is for them,
under God, in a pre-eminent degree, to find
out the secret, and then to live it out, how to
be at once the perfectly genuine man, devoted
to the service of men, carrying what he is and
what he believes into the actual surroundings
of modern life, not allowing illusions and poetic
day-dreams to come between him and facts; and
also the convinced, unwavering, spiritual Christian,
conversant with his own soul, and with his
living Lord and Saviour, and with that sacred,
unalterable written Word which that Saviour
put into His people's hands, never to be taken
out of them. Nothing is more wanted at
present in the sphere of "Church life and
work," unless I am greatly mistaken, than a
generation of young Clergymen (soon to be
seniors) who shall conspicuously combine the
best forms of practicality with an unmistakable
chastened personal spirituality which is seen
to be "the pulse of" their busy "machine."
And if the spirituality is to be indeed genuine
(away with it if it is anything but genuine to
the centre), if it is to be quite different on the[Pg&nbsp;32]
one hand from a thing of artificial phrases, and
on the other from merely formulated and regulated
devoutness, I am deeply sure that its only
secret and preservative is a fully-maintained
secret walk with God.

"GOD, I THANK THEE."

"I am rich, and increased with goods, and
have need of nothing." [Rev. iii. 17.] Such was the
thought and word of the Laodicean long ago.
Is it not in effect the thought, if not the word,
of not a few hard workers and energetic enterprizers
now? "What do I want with the
dialect of 'Christian experience'? What have
I, with all these irons in the fire, and a strong
hammer and a strong hand with which to strike
them, what have I to do with 'old-world faiths'
about sin and salvation, about grace and conversion,
about pardon and justification? What
have I so pressingly to do with much prayer,
save in the form of much work? God, I thank
Thee that I am a worker; let it be for others
to dive into spiritual secrets, if it is good for
them to do so."

"THOU KNOWEST NOT."

I would not overdraw the picture. And the
words I have put into a possible mouth are
words which, if I heard, I hope I should hear[Pg&nbsp;33]
with every wish to judge them fairly and to
see where any truth lay in them. But none
the less I am sure that those words not unjustly
represent a type of thought widely
prevalent among even ministerial workers, and
that it is a type of thought pregnant with
disaster for Christian work. "Thou knowest
not that thou art poor"; "I counsel thee, to
buy of Me"; "I stand at the door and knock:
if any man hear My voice and open
the door I will come in to him and
sup with him, and he with Me." [Rev. iii. 17, 18, 20.] So said Jesus
Christ to the Laodicean. And though it may
seem paradoxical to compare a man involved
in the rush of modern "Church work" with
the Laodicean, the comparison may not be
always far astray, nor the words of the Lord
in Rev. iii. 18 out of place accordingly. To be
"neither cold nor hot" towards Him is all
too possible for us, alas, even when "the irons
in the fire" are most numerous, and even when
they are being most briskly hammered.

TO KNOW CHRIST IS INDISPENSABLE.

So let us listen, making a pause to do so.
Perhaps just now the knock may be audible,
and certain articulate sounds may come from[Pg&nbsp;34]
outside, saying that a Person waits for readmission
to His place in our busy, multifarious
life, and that He can be content with nothing
short of heart-intimacy with us, and that we,
if we would not forsake our own mercy, must
be content with nothing short of heart-intimacy
with Him.

"I counsel thee to buy of Me." Let us do
it; let us pay over, at His feet, our poor
fancied wealth of self's energies and undertakings
(as regards our own good opinion of
them), receiving from Him the heavenly "gold"
of His own glorious grace and peace, and the
"white robe" of a living and loving conformity
to His likeness, and the "eye-salve" of His
illumination, in which we see things as He
sees them. It is better, as von Machtholf says
it is, to have Him within the heart's chamber,
at once as Guest and as Host, in that blessed
inter-communion, than to be apparently the
most successful of organizers or of toilers,
strong in ourselves, but without the secret of
the Presence of the Lord.

It is scarcely needful, I trust, to explain
what I do not mean. My very last intention[Pg&nbsp;35]
is to speak slightingly of devoted work and
self-sacrificing endeavours, whether or no they
take the line which most approves itself to me.
A fain&eacute;ant in the English Ministry to-day is
something worse than even a cumberer of the
ground; he is, I dare to say, like a upas upon
it, blighting where he throws his shadow, so
conspicuous and so deadly must be the example
of such a life in the Minister of such a Gospel.
But what I mean, again and again, is this, that
the days demand, along with a thoroughgoing
while prudent practicality, more and more also
of a profound reality of spiritual knowledge of
the Lord in those who labour in His Name.
With the growing stress of our time we must
have not less but more of this, in those who
are called to meet that stress. This is vital,
if we would not be stifled and succumb as
Christians altogether.

So this is my plea, dear Brother in the
Ministry, now making your first essays in some
great city parish, or wherever it may be: cultivate,
as for your life, secret intercourse with God.

BIBLE STUDY.

And with this view, I now say specially,
cultivate such intercourse laying His holy Word[Pg&nbsp;36]
open before you. I spoke in the previous
Chapter of the Bible spread open by the
evening lamp, the Bible marked with signs of
diligent search. With all my heart I mean
to press that thought. It will be best to
reserve for another Chapter certain suggestions
on methods of Bible study. But I may,
and I will at once, offer a few words on the
subject in general. It is a subject which lies
near my heart, and of the urgent importance
of which I am very sure.

THE ORDINATION CHARGE.

Above all then I would entreat you to be
a Bible student at whatever cost of other
religious reading. It is a very common thing
to substitute, practically, for the Bible a little
library of livres de pi&eacute;t&eacute;, as the French would
call them, small "good books." Not very long
ago, in the course of an ordination examination,
I came across an instructive instance. In
answer to a question in a "Pastoral Paper"
for candidates for Priest's Orders, a thoughtful
young Clergyman stated incidentally that he
used every day with great profit certain devotional
books, and that about twice a week
he took for definite meditation and prayer a[Pg&nbsp;37]
passage from the Gospels. It struck me that
here was a strange and sad inversion of the
right order of proportion; devotional books
daily, and the New Testament (in any sense
of earnest meditative study) about twice a
week! Very different, I thought, is the view
and teaching of the Church of England in this
matter of the spiritual reading of her Ministers.
What does the Church say, through the Bishop,
when the Deacon is ordained Presbyter?
"Seeing that you cannot by any other means
compass the doing of so weighty a work, pertaining
to the salvation of man, but with
doctrine and exhortation taken out of the Holy
Scriptures, and with a life agreeable to the
same; consider how studious ye ought to be
in reading and learning the Scriptures....
We have good hope that you will continually
pray to God the Father, by the mediation of
our only Saviour Jesus Christ, for the heavenly
assistance of the Holy Ghost; that, by daily
reading and weighing of the Scriptures, ye
may wax riper and stronger in your Ministry."

And I need not go about to prove that the
Church does not mean such daily "reading and[Pg&nbsp;38]
weighing" to wait till the young man is actually
ordained Priest. We should scarcely have had
the First Homily of the First Book written, if
such had been her mind. Have you ever read
over that "Voice of the Church"?

M. HENRI LASSERRE ON DEVOTIONAL READING.

A remarkable confirmation of my present
contention comes to us from an unexpected
quarter. I refer to the Preface prefixed by that
ardent Roman Catholic, M. Henri Lasserre, to
his remarkable French translation of the Four
Gospels, the book which, December 4, 1886,
received the cordial benediction of Leo XIII.,
but within a twelvemonth, such is "the power
behind the Pope," was placed on the Index
Expurgatorius. Probably such passages as
the following had much to do with this strange
and sudden self-reversal of the judgment of the
Vatican.

"A timid school," after the crisis of the
Reformation, which finds, of course, little favour
with M. Lasserre, and on which, very unjustly,
he lays much of the blame of the practical
prohibition of the Bible within "the Catholic
Church," "a timid school tended thenceforth to
strike from the hands of believers the divine[Pg&nbsp;39]
Book which makes the foundation of our faith,
and laboured to substitute for it by degrees a
pious literature, intended to furnish hearts and
minds with a nourishment suited to their weakness,
a diet without danger. Some of these
books, we own without hesitation, are excellent
in themselves, and have contributed to the
sanctification of many souls. However, this is
the exception. In the majority of these works,
where, alas, the sugar of devotion takes the
place of the salt of wisdom, the eternal truths
and the genuine teachings of the Gospel were
soon diluted, and, as it were, lost in strange
waters.... One and all, the better specimens
and the deplorable (les lamentables) alike, they
are another thing altogether, yes, absolutely
another thing, than the Gospel, whose apostolic
mission they have noiselessly usurped by an
invasion insensible, I had almost called it clandestine....
The general ignorance of the
Gospels has been the one cause in France,
these twenty years, of the success of the scandalous
romance which appeared under the title
of La Vie de J&eacute;sus. Among a people moderately
familiar with the narratives of St Matthew,[Pg&nbsp;40]
St Mark, St Luke, and St John ... there
would have been no need to refute it. Every
one would have seen, without assistance, its
flagrant falsifications, its gross sophisms, its
absolute emptiness. This deep-seated and complex
evil, this enervation of the Christian spirit,
this an&aelig;mia (cette an&eacute;mie) of so many among us,
are an object of sorrowful anxiety (pr&eacute;occupation)
for the Catholic thinker" (pp. x, xxv).

CURRENT NEGLECT OF SCRIPTURE.

For the Protestant thinker too, within
a Church which has now for centuries, in
every possible official way, pressed home the
reading of the Bible upon her every member,
and of course upon her every Minister,
there is material for similar anxieties, mutatis
mutandis. Bible study, such as our Lord and
the Apostles enjoined and encouraged, is not
on the increase amongst us, to say the least of
it; certainly the ignorance of the blessed Book
even among candidates for holy Orders is
sometimes, is not seldom, very great indeed.
Nay more, there is sometimes, however rarely
as yet, an ominous disposition even in clerical
circles to shelve the Bible. Quite lately I
heard, on excellent authority, that a certain[Pg&nbsp;41]
large Clerical Society, revising its rules, deliberately
decided that the meetings shall not in
future be begun with the reading of Scripture.
My friend and Brother, do not swim even on
the edges of such a current. Swim with all
your might, in your Master's might, against it.

READ IT FOR YOUR OWN NEEDS.

Then lastly I put in my plea, as I sought to
do when we were considering the matter of
secret prayer, for such a secret study of the
Word of God as shall be unprofessional, unclerical,
and simply Christian. Resolve to
"read, mark, and inwardly digest" so that not
now the flock but the shepherd, that is to say
you, "may embrace and ever hold fast the
blessed hope of everlasting life." It will be
all the better for the flock. Forget sometimes,
in the name of Jesus Christ, the pulpit, the
mission-room, the Bible-class; open the Bible
as simply as if you were on Crusoe's island,
and were destined to live and die there, alone
with God. You will be all the fresher, all the
more sympathetic and to the point, when you
do come to speak to the listening people about
the Book. The discoveries which we make in
it for our own souls are just the things which[Pg&nbsp;42]
we cannot help reporting so as to interest and
attract our brethren; as least, that is the sure
tendency of things.

BRIDGES AND WITSIUS ON BIBLE STUDY.

Let me write out a slightly abbreviated extract
from a golden book, unhappily no longer
in print, The Christian Ministry, by that
diligent student, loving and laborious Pastor,
and heavenly-minded man, the remembrance of
whom shines on me like a ray reflected from
the Chief Shepherd's face, the late Rev. Charles
Bridges.[2]

[2] He died at Hinton Martell, in Dorset, 1869.

"The maxim, Bonus textuarius est bonus
theologus, marks a grand ministerial qualification&mdash;'mighty
in the Scriptures.' The importance
of this is beautifully expressed by Witsius:
'Let the theologian ascend from the lower
school of natural study to the higher department
of Scripture, and sitting at the feet of
God as his teacher, learn from His mouth the
hidden mysteries of salvation, which eye hath
not seen nor ear heard, which none of the princes
of this world knew; which the most accurate
reason cannot search out; which the heavenly[Pg&nbsp;43]
chorus of angels, though always beholding the
face of God, desire to look into. In the hidden
book of Scripture, and nowhere else, are opened
the secrets of the most sacred wisdom. Let
the theologian delight in these sacred Oracles;
let him exercise himself in them day and night;
let him meditate in them; let him live in
them; let him draw all his wisdom from them;
let him compare all his thoughts with them; let
him embrace nothing in religion which he does
not find there. The attentive study of the
Scriptures has a sort of constraining power.
It fills the mind with the most splendid form
of heavenly truth. It soothes the mind with
an inexpressible sweetness; it satisfies the
sacred hunger and thirst for knowledge; ... it
imprints its own testimony so firmly on the
mind, that the believing soul rests on it with
the same security as if it had been carried up
into the third heaven and heard it from God's
own mouth; it touches all the affections, and
breathes the sweetest fragrance of holiness upon
the pious reader, even though he may not perhaps
comprehend the full extent of his reading.... We
ought to draw our views of divine[Pg&nbsp;44]
truths immediately from the Scriptures themselves,
and to make no other use of human
writings than as indices marking those chief
points of theology from which we may be
instructed in the mind of the Lord'" (pp. 79,
80, ed. 1830).



RIDLEY IN THE ORCHARD.

"In thy Orchard, Pembroke Hall," wrote
Nicholas Ridley within a few days of his fiery
martyrdom, "(the wals, buts, and trees, if they
could speake, would beare me witnes), I learned
without booke almost all Paules epistles, yea,
and I weene all the Canonicall epistles, save
only the Apocalyps. Of which study, although
in time a great part did depart from me, yet
the sweete smell thereof I trust I shall cary
with me into heaven; for the profite thereof
I thinke I have felt in all my lyfe tyme ever
after."

And so shall it be with us also, if we go and
do likewise in our "lyfe tyme," our period, not
at present of martyrdom but, God knoweth it,
of need.



[Pg&nbsp;45]
CHAPTER IIICONTENTS

SECRET STUDY OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES.

[Pg&nbsp;46]

Like those Emmaus travellers we go
Forth from the city-gate of things below;
Christ at our side, His Scripture for our light,
Here burning hearts and there the beatific sight.

[Pg&nbsp;47

Already I have broken ground to some
extent in the all-important subject of private
Bible Study. Let me now put before my reader
and Brother a few more detailed remarks and
suggestions on that subject. Such is the holy
Book, and such is the variety of possible modes
of study, that all I can dream of doing is to
touch some parts and sides of the matter which
present themselves with special impressiveness
to my own mind, or which experience of the
needs of friends has suggested to me somewhat
particularly.

HIGHER CRITICISM.

To discuss the sacred problems of Scripture
Inspiration is not my purpose here. Elsewhere[3]
I have attempted to deal with some of
them. All I would do here is, in view of what[Pg&nbsp;48]
is truly a "present necessity," to ask my
Brethren, very deliberately, not to be in haste
to take up with the last and boldest word of
what is called the Higher Criticism (I speak
particularly now of its application to the Old
Testament), as if its "advances" were always
towards light and fact. I have no complaint
against the term Higher Criticism, which has
a recognized place in literary technical language,
denoting that familiar and lawful process,
the study of books not for their grammar and
style only, but in order to infer from their
whole phenomena what their age is, and their
structure, and their character. The Higher
Criticism is a term pointing not to methods
and results transcending ordinary intelligence,
but to a study which aims "higher" than
grammatical and textual questions considered
as final. And thus of course the most earnest
defender of the supernatural character of the
Scriptures may be, and very often is, as
diligent a "higher critic" as the extremest
anti-supernaturalist.

[3] Veni Creator, ch. iii

A PLEA FOR CAUTION.

It is not its definition in the abstract but its
actual work and spirit, as seen in many lead[Pg&nbsp;49]ing
instances, which constrain me to enter an
earnest protest against a too easy confidence in
this criticism of, particularly, the Old Testament
Scriptures. It is "a thing to give us
pause" when we are asked to accept it as
proved, or at least as extremely probable, that
righteous Abel is a myth; that there was little,
if any, monotheism before Abraham; no theophany
at Sinai; no Wilderness-Tabernacle; no
record of the conquest of Canaan written till
long generations after the event; not much
written record at all till Samuel; few, if any,
Psalms before the age of the Captivity, if not
before the age of the Maccabees; certainly
two if not more Isaiahs, and probably hardly
one Daniel; at least, that the book bearing his
name dates from the second century before
Christ, and is in fact a Palestinian story-book
which has not, perhaps, even a nucleus of
history within it. It ought to make us stop
and think when we are told that Isaiah did not
predict coming events; indeed (for the drift of
this teaching goes very strongly in that direction),
that predictive prophecy is hardly to be
recognized anywhere; that it is better out of[Pg&nbsp;50]
our thoughts; that it is but "soothsaying"
after all, and that the true work of the prophet
was not to fore-tell but to "forth-tell," to proclaim
present and eternal principles, which
again were not revealed to him from above but
arrived at by intuitions and meditations within
his own consciousness. It is a grave thing to
be asked to believe, as many would have us
do, that such was the lack of feeling for veracity
in ancient Judah that Hilkiah, Jeremiah, and
Huldah could arrange for the "discovery" of
a fabricated Deuteronomy, and then (see the
narrative in the Second Book of
Kings [xxii. 8-20.]) get the prophetess to follow up the
fabrication with awful denunciations&mdash;all fulfilled&mdash;in
the name of the Lord Himself. Such
theories we are asked to hold in face of our
Master Christ's deliberate, persistent, manifold
testimony to the supernatural character and
authority of the Old Testament; to the solidity
of its records of fact, to the reality of its predictive
element&mdash;on which He stayed His sacred
soul in Gethsemane, and on the Cross itself.
It is no longer a question of details, an inquiry
whether the numerals are invariably authentic[Pg&nbsp;51]
and accurate; whether the minute particulars
of a king's death as told in Chronicles tally
with the account in Kings. It is a question
whether the Old Testament at large is not a
singularly and flagrantly untrustworthy record.
It is a question whether its literature as a whole
is not to be explained, practically, by "natural
causes"; including a causation by deliberate,
elaborate, and interested untruth.

A GRAVE ALTERNATIVE.

Is it too much to say that the alternative has
come to be this: Was our Lord Himself right
or very gravely wrong about the nature of
Scripture? Did the Spirit of Pentecost guide
the Apostles into all truth, or leave them under
a vast illusion in this central matter of their
witness? "Do not follow this Book, young
men; follow Christ": so said a speaker of high
Christian reputation, holding up a Bible, before
a great gathering in America, not long ago.
But what does this mean? Christ carries the
Book in His hand; if you follow Him you must
follow it. If you decline to follow the Book,
your following Him is a following&mdash;so far as
at present you agree with Him, and not further.

WITNESSES FOR SCRIPTURE.

Meantime, what are some facts of the case,[Pg&nbsp;52]
facts not nearly so well remembered now as
they should be? One comprehensive fact is
that the testimony of nature and of history
goes, as a whole, to affirm the veracity of the
Scripture records, and to do so more and more
pointedly as research advances. In a remarkable
recent essay by the Duke of Argyll
(Nineteenth Century, January, 1891), the growing
accumulation of geological evidence for a
Great Flood, affecting at least the northern
hemisphere, and falling within the human
period, is forcibly set out by a master hand.
In the same paper is indicated the fast-gathering
evidence, now digging up month by month
from the soil of Palestine, to the accuracy of
the picture of Canaan drawn in the Pentateuch
and Joshua. The Ordnance Survey of Sinai
has amply shown that the geology of the
peninsula confirms down to minute details the
record in Exodus.[4] And now the Oxford
Arabic Professor is making it, at the least,
extremely likely that the Hebrew written two
centuries before Christ was more modern by[Pg&nbsp;53]
many generations than that presented by the
Book of Daniel.[5]

[4] See Sir J. Dawson: Modern Science in Bible Lands, "The
Topography of the Exodus."

[5] See Margoliouth: The Place of Ecclesiasticus in Semitic
Literature.

I am only indicating and suggesting. Remembering
the curiously similar history of New
Testament criticism during the recent past,
some of its stages running out their course
within my own memory, I cannot but think,
looking from the merely literary view-point,
that the days are not far off when the now
powerful theories of revolutionary criticism will
seem improbable. And so I ask my younger
Brethren at least to pause before going with
the strong, deep stream.

THE DUKE OF ARGYLL QUOTED.

Let me quote a few sentences from the Duke
of Argyll's paper:&mdash;

THE WORK OF THE SPADE.

"The assumption ... that precision in research
is undermining the credit of the Hebrew
Scriptures, is a presumption almost comically
at variance with fact. There is, in particular,
one 'weapon of precision' which has of late
been working wonders in precisely the opposite
direction. That weapon is the spade. And
what has it been unearthing? Everywhere[Pg&nbsp;54]
over that narrow strip of our planet on which
its human interests have been most impressive
and profound&mdash;everywhere from Tyre and
Sidon, from Carmel and Lebanon, on the west,
to Babylon and Nineveh and the boundary
mountains of Assyria on the east&mdash;the spade
has been disentombing continuous and triumphant
proof of the genuine antiquity and
historical character of the Jewish books....
Only the other day Mr Flinders Petrie has
told us how the spade has uncovered those
impregnable walls of the Amorite cities which
were reported to invading Israel by the spies
of Moses....

"I may be permitted to express a very
strong opinion that in recent years Christian
writers have been far too shy and timid in
defending one of the oldest and strongest outworks
of Christian theology. I mean the element
of true prediction in Hebrew prophecy.
It may be true that in a former generation too
exclusive attention had been paid to it....
But the reaction has been excessive and
irrational. A great mass of connected facts,
and of continuous evidence, remains&mdash;which[Pg&nbsp;55]
cannot be gainsaid. Even if the greater prophets
can be brought down to the very latest
date which the very latest fancies can assign to
them, they depict and predict overthrows and
vast revolutions in the East which did not take
place for centuries" (pp. 28, 30).[6]

[6] "Professor Huxley speaks of the hopeless position of Christian
divines 'raked by the fatal weapons of precision with which
the enfants perdus of the advancing forces of science are
armed.' ... Perhaps he means the small arms of the modern
critical school. If he does, then precision is the very last characteristic
which belongs to it. Its methods are largely subjective.
Here and there it may have a clearly ascertained fact to rest
upon. Here and there it may have arrived at some tolerably
secure results. But in the main its methods are metaphysical,
resting on nothing but individual preconceptions, applying tests
and private canons of interpretation which are purely arbitrary"
(Ibid., p. 28).



PREDICTION.

The analysis of prophetic consciousness may
be, and in a great measure is, impossible. But
the facts of prediction remain. It remains
that our Lord Himself predicted. He foretold
minutely His own death, and the end of the
City and the Temple, and the circumstances
of the close of this &aelig;on. Was He "soothsaying"?
It remains that He perpetually and
most emphatically claimed to be the exact[Pg&nbsp;56]
Fulfilment of predictions which, on any hypothesis,
were then ages old. Was He mistaken
in their character and quality?

CHRIST'S WITNESS TO THE BIBLE.

In those last words I step, as I well know,
upon a field of the most urgent controversy.
What is the weight to be assigned to our ever
blessed Lord's verdict upon the Old Testament
as history and prophecy? It is now asserted,
and by Christian men, that that verdict is not
final; that He in the days of His flesh so
submitted to human limitations that He was
liable to mistakes of fact just as His best
contemporaries were; that we adore Christ,
and rely absolutely on Him, but it is on Christ
not as He was but as He is, the glorified
Christ. Here is an unspeakably overawing
subject. I would not treat of it as if the
question could be swept away in a sentence.
But I do, as in our living Master's presence,
venture to say that His witness to the nature
and character of the Old Scriptures claims
definitely to be ex cathedr&acirc;. True, He doubtless
spoke in this matter, as elsewhere, not in
what may be called the technical style; not
every reference of His to "Moses" need neces[Pg&nbsp;57]sarily
mean to assert precisely that Moses wrote
every clause of the Pentateuch. But the
present question goes, as we have remembered,
much deeper. It asks whether or no the Lord
Jesus was altogether and in principle mistaken.
He treated the Law, Prophets, and Psalms as
a solid structure of historic fact and supernatural
promise, divinely planned all through,
divinely carried out and up from the foundation,
and leading straight up to Himself. Was it
all the time true that large parts of them were
no more historical than the False Decretals on
which the high Papal claims were built?[7]

[7] I may remind the reader that about the middle of the ninth
century there were published, by one Isidore, a collection of
decisions and decrees, purporting to be by the earliest Bishops
of Rome, all supporting the Papal claims as known in the Middle
Ages. The collection was afterwards increased, and in the
middle of the twelfth century engrafted into Gratian's Decretum,
on which is based the Canon Law of the Roman Church. These
documents are undoubtedly fabrications long after date.

If we revise the opinion of our Redeemer
on this conspicuous point of His teaching,
where shall we securely pause? Certainly we
cannot securely trust, as oracular and final, His
own predictions of things still future, at least
in their details.[Pg&nbsp;58]

HE HAS AFFIRMED IT FROM ABOVE.

One great utterance is often quoted as a
confession that His conscious knowledge had
limits; Mark xiii. 32. Quite true; but what
sort of confession is it? It indicates in its
very terms the vastness of His supernatural
knowledge; asserting His cognizance of the
fact that the angels in heaven did not know that
day and hour. Such an avowal of nescience is
an implicit assertion of an immeasurable insight.

And has He not, as the glorified Christ,
thrown a light of affirmation on the "opinions"
of the days of His flesh? The glorified Christ
sent down the Paraclete. And the first and
abiding work of the Paraclete was to illuminate
the Apostles with a new understanding of the
truth and glory of the Old Scriptures, altogether
in the lines of their crucified Master's teaching
about them. Unless indeed Resurrection, and
Ascension, and Pentecost are themselves to
melt into the haze of myth! The New Testament
is as full of the supernatural as the Old.

Reverently and humbly, and with full recognition
of a large place and lawful work for a
true higher criticism in the literature of the
Old Testament, and of the New, I yet decline[Pg&nbsp;59]
to think that our Lord's estimate of the nature
of the Bible is not to be final for me, and that
His reasonings from it are to be revised, while
yet I adore Him as my Light, my Life, and
my God. And I ask my Brethren to pause
many times, and on their knees, before they
think otherwise.

PRESENT FULFILMENTS OF PROPHECY.

As regards prediction, let them look around
them. Two great fulfilments of Old Testament
prediction are going forward at this
moment. One is, the vast work of missions,
whose whole aim is to make known "to the
ends of the earth" the Name of Messiah, Son
of David, Son of Abraham, Son of God. The
other is, the dispersion and yet permanence of
the Jewish race, and (may I not add, in view
of the facts of the last few years?) the beginnings
of a re-population of Palestine by the
Jews. Credible statistics assure us that they
are now returning to their old land at the rate of
many thousands in a year. True, no "miracle"
brings them back. But no thoughtful student
has ever said that the miracle of prediction
demands miracle in the circumstances of the
fulfilment.[Pg&nbsp;60]

BIBLE READING IS THE BEST DEFENCE OF THE BIBLE.

I have gone beyond my intended length in
these observations.[8] The present urgency of
the subject, which encounters us everywhere,
is my apology. But now, all the more gladly
for the delay, I hasten to a few simple words
of suggestion on that practical duty of Secret
Bible Reading which is, after all, the best and
surest antidote and preservative against scepticism
about the Bible, if it is carried on at
once thoroughly, intelligently, and as before
the Lord. Vain without it, worse than vain,[Pg&nbsp;61]
will be the most diligent and successful study
of the apologetics of the Bible. For the Bible
was given to be, not a battle-field, but a field
of wheat, and pasturage, and flowers, and a
gold-field also all the while.

[8] (I) have elsewhere called attention to the following among
works helpful at present in the controversy about Scripture:
Lord Hatherley's Continuity of Scripture, Dr Waller's Authoritative
Inspiration, Dr Cave's Inspiration of the Old Testament.
Let me add four able popular tractates: Cave's Battle of the
Standpoints (Queen's Printers), Eckersley's Historical Value of
the Old Testament (Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge),
G. Carlyle's Moses and the Prophets and Seaver's Authority of
Christ (Elliot Stock). Dr Liddon's memorable sermon, The
Worth of the Old Testament, is full of helpful suggestions. See
too Professor Leathes' Witness of the Old Testament to Christ,
Sir J.W. Dawson's Modern Science in Bible Lands, and Bishop
Harold Browne's Messiah Foretold. I specially call attention
to Canon R. Girdlestone's recent book, the work of a master,
The Foundations of the Bible, most temperate, judicial, solid,
and establishing; and to this must be added now (1892) Bishop
Ellicott's excellent Charge, published by the S.P.C.K. under the
title Christus Comprobator.

How then shall I read my Bible so as at
once spiritually and mentally to know it, or
rather, to be always getting to know it? The
answer must be&mdash;"at sundry times and in
divers manners." I must make time to read
often, however brief each time may be. And
I must use methods of study, more than one,
in parallel lines.

As a sort of ground-work to all other methods
I venture first to say, be always reading the
Bible through, however slowly, or rapidly.
For certain purposes, for instance in order
to grasp the scope of a book, as perhaps an
Epistle, or the Revelation, or St John's Gospel,
or the latter half of Isaiah, or the Book of
Genesis,[9] rapid reading may be quite reverently[Pg&nbsp;62]
done. In any case, get as soon as you may,
and as often as is practicable and practical, over
the whole surface. Lord Hatherley, amidst the
heavy occupations of a barrister's and judge's
life, used to read the whole Book through carefully
every year, and this for more than thirty
years. I cannot say that I do the same. But
I aim to read the Bible over carefully within
every few years.

[9] To touch on a very small point I write here "the Book of
Genesis," not "the Book Genesis." English literature, if I do
not mistake, is as unfamiliar with the latter phrase as it is with
"the city London."

PLOUGH-HUSBANDRY.

Then, practise what I would call the plough-husbandry
of the Book. "Make long furrows."
Investigate what the Scriptures have to say
by topics, by doctrines, by leading words, over
great breadths of their surface; keeping that
subject, that word, all along in view. Bring all
your mind to work that way, in the light of the
Presence sought by prayer. An occasional
special form of such study may be illustrated
by that admirable book, written long ago, but
full of life still, the late Professor Blunt's Undesigned
Coincidences. I was thankful in my
first days of ministry to be led to put in practice
its examples and suggestions by ploughing in
the field of the New Testament for the coincidences
between the Gospel narrative and the[Pg&nbsp;63]
allusions to our blessed Lord's life scattered
over the Epistles.

SPADE-HUSBANDRY.

Then, practise also a diligent spade-husbandry
in your Bible study. Dig as well as plough.
In each narrow plot of the great field there are
treasures hid. Dig a verse sometimes, using
perhaps the spade of parallel references. Dig
a paragraph at other times; a chapter; a short
book. You are quite sure, under the blessing
of the Master of the Field, to bring up rich
results, more or less.

I will close my talk upon the Bible by
offering a specimen of such spade-husbandry.
A few years ago, at the Church Congress at
Wakefield, I read a paper on Bible-reading.
It mainly took the line of recommending
earnestly the use of the Biblical student's
"spade," and then it illustrated the recommendation
by the following "spade-study" of
the Epistle of St Paul to the Philippians;
given here just as it was read.

A CHURCH CONGRESS PAPER ON BIBLE STUDY.

"It has been laid on me to say a few words
on the devotional study of the Holy Scriptures,
taking some one Book of Scripture, and in some[Pg&nbsp;64]
sort exemplifying such study from it. I accept
the theme, with a deep sense both of its opportuneness
in our busy period, so full of temptations
to the Christian Minister to postpone his
Bible-study to other things, and of its sacred,
paramount, vital importance. May our divine
and sovereign Master be pleased to use my
simple suggestions to call once more the attention
especially of His ordained servants to
the urgency of our need to be personal Bible-students
before Him, and to the strength and
joy that lies in such study, really pursued. He,
in the days of His flesh, was the supreme Believer
in the Bible, the supreme Lover, Student,
Expositor, and Employer of the Bible. With
the letter of the Bible He sustained Himself
and quelled the Enemy in the Temptation, and
the quotations He then selected suggest the
minuteness of His study. Upon the written
Word He spent the whole Easter afternoon.
Accepted Sacrifice for Sin, Conqueror of
Death, Lord and Head of Life, He had come
that morning from the grave; and He came
as it were holding the Scriptures in His
hands.
[Pg&nbsp;65]
"He found around Him in those earthly
days a mass of religious popular opinions, and
He spoke His holy mind freely against the
false among them. But there was one opinion
which He noticed only to sanction, to sanctify,
to glorify. It was the opinion that the Scriptures
were divine, were charged with the
authority of God.

"I pray to Him, and trust Him, my Master
and Lord, to hold me now humbly firm to the
end, after many a struggle, in His opinion of
the Holy Scriptures. I would enter into, as
He abode in, their rest; therefore I accept, as
He accepted, their yoke. I would feel what
He felt, that living incitement to their study
which is indissolubly bound up, if I mistake not,
with the firm persuasion of their supernatural
character and authority. I would read them,
as He read them, above all things to act upon
them in the life which we, His followers, have
in Him; that life whose exercise and outcome
means our whole walk here as well as hereafter.
I would regard them, as it is apparent
that He regarded them, as being (in a sacred
sense) self-sufficient; not, indeed, to the self[Pg&nbsp;66]-sufficient
reader, but to the reader who prays
in reverent simplicity that the Holy Spirit may
dispel every moral mist, every hindrance of
heart and will, from between him and the
meaning of the written Word; and who
intends in truthful sincerity to consent to, to
obey, the discovered meaning; and who is
taking pains over the Book.

"It is a great joy to know how entirely this
was the view of the matter held, and loved, and
taught in the ancient Church. Is there anything
about which there is a larger consent of
the Fathers? St Athanasius loves to dilate
on the &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8049;&#961;&#954;&#949;&#953;&#945;, the self-sufficingness, of 'the
divine Scriptures.' St Cyril of Jerusalem
entreats his hearers to guide and fix their
belief by the reading of the Canonical books.
St Chrysostom boldly accounts for all mischiefs
by the lack of personal acquaintance with the
Scriptures.

"We are in the nineteenth century, almost
in the twentieth, and perhaps we therefore
need, even more than our elder brethren of
the fourth, to renew our energies in Scripture-study
by prayerful, painstaking recollection of[Pg&nbsp;67]
what the Book is. We need an ever fresh
realization of what it is immortally, unalterably;
the divinely trustworthy, and therefore authoritative,
account of God's mind, and specially
and above all of God's mind concerning Jesus
Christ and our relations to Him, our life by
Him, our peace, and power, and hope, in Him.
And it is a few words about this aspect of
Scripture, and the search of Scripture, that I
now lay before you, with humility and simplicity
of purpose, in the way of a description and
example of a sort of study that has been a
great blessing to myself.

"Take one of the holy Books, or a section
of one of them; and for this purpose shorter is
better. By a certain exercise of imagination
suppose yourself to be reading a newly-discovered
fragment of the apostolic age. Treat
it somewhat as many of us have recently sought
to treat Bryennius' discovery, The Teaching of
the Twelve Apostles. What microscopic attention
has been brought to bear upon that little
book, just because good evidence gives it a
place in the first century, and because it speaks
of Christ, and of Christians; of faith, worship,[Pg&nbsp;68]
ministry, and life, in a part of the primeval
Church! Now I attempt from time to time,
reverently but very simply, to treat some inspired
Epistle somewhat in the same way. I
place myself before it as much as possible as
if it were new to me and others. I seek, with
something of the curiosity which such conditions
would create, to collect and arrange its
theology and its ethics. And then I bring in
upon the results of my study the fact that
it is God's Word, the Word which I am to
embrace, and live upon, and act upon, to-day.

"For example and suggestion, let us turn to
the Epistle to the Philippians; few but golden
pages, precious product of those two years of
St Paul's physical imprisonment but blissful
spiritual liberty. To stimulate our consciousness
of what the Epistle contains to reward
search, and search alone, let us try to place it
before us as what it is not now, but once was,
a newly-given oracle of God. It was once read
for the first time, perhaps in the house of
Lydia. Let it be to us, so far as thought can
make it so, what it was then. And let us[Pg&nbsp;69]
remember all the while that it is really even
now new, for it is immortal with the breath of
the Spirit of God. It not only 'abideth,' but
'liveth,' for ever.

"Let us take two titles under which to classify
the results of our inspection of this primitive
Document. First, its doctrine of Christ; then,
its doctrine of Christian Life. As a subordinate
third title we may collect what it indicates of
Christian life as exemplified in the Writer's
allusions to his own experience.

"I.&mdash;The Christology of the Epistle.

"(1) We trace hints of the human history of
Christ. He was man, in reality and in seeming;
He died a death of suffering, the
death of the Cross [ii. 7, 8; iii. 10.]; He rose again, for there
is a power of His Resurrection iii. 10.];
[and, apparently, He so left this earth that it
was known that an immeasurable exaltation
attended His going, so that the
heavens are now His seat [ii. 9.], from which He is
definitely expected to return.
[iii. 20.]

"(2) Going back to antecedent and prehistoric
matters of faith about Him, we find
here that before He became man He subsisted[Pg&nbsp;70]
in possession, lawful and natural, of the manifested
reality &#956;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#8052; of Godhead,
equal to God [ii. 6.]. His appearance as man was
the sequel of His own action of will in that
eternal state [ii. 7.]. It was a novel and
voluntary assumption of the condition of the
Bondservant, the &#916;&#959;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;, of God. Antecedently
possessing the &#956;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#8052; of God, He now de novo
'took' the &#956;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#8052; of a bondservant. What
created beings in general are of course, God's
bondservants, He had not been but now became;
a fact as astonishing in its region as
the fact of His possession of the Supreme
Nature is in its region. He assumed this
&#948;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#949;&#8055;&#945;, we find, because His essential work
was to obey, to 'become obeying,' yes, to the
extent of death [ii. 8.]; which death was
thus in Him altogether voluntary, part of a free
undertaking to be not His own. The immediate
result for Himself, it next appears, was
an exaltation by God to supreme majesty
under all these conditions. As being all this,
possessor of Deity and accepter of bondservice,
He was now de novo proclaimed as &#922;&#8059;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;, as
Lord, in a sense interpreted by the adoration[Pg&nbsp;71]
of the universe; to the glory of God His
Father. For it repeatedly appears
in the Epistle that God is His Father; He is
the Son of God[ii. 11.]. Further, all 'the
riches of God in glory' [i. 2; ii. 11.] are 'in Him.' [iv. 19.]
It appears that in His exaltation He is embodied
still, for it is to likeness to the body of His
glory that the body of our humiliation is to
be changed at His expected return. He is
Almighty 'to subdue all things,' and
the subjugation is 'to Himself.' [iii. 21.]

"(3) As regards His relation to His followers,
such is it that their whole life and every
exercise of it is mysteriously but emphatically
said to be in Him. He, the supreme Bondservant,
is to them (we continually read)
absolute Lord. His grace animates their spirit.
The divine Spirit ministered to them
is His [i. 2; iv. 23.]. Their 'fruit of righteousness'
is generated and produced 'through'
Him [i. 19.]. He is evermore and profoundly near
to them. Their heart-emotions are
'in His heart.' [i. 11; iv. 5.] To believe in Him
is their essential characteristic [i. 8.]. To
suffer for Him is a special boon to them [i. 29.].[Pg&nbsp;72]
They live in expectation of His return, His day. [i. 6, 10; ii. 16; iii. 20.]

"II.&mdash;The Epistle's account of Christian
Life, inward and outward.

"We gather that the disciples are saints,
&#7941;&#947;&#953;&#959;&#953;, separated from self and sin to God;
brethren to one another; the true
Israel, citizens of the City above [i. 1, 14; iii. 3, 20; iv. 21.].
Their being and life are so united to Christ, that
they as Christians (and it is evidently assumed
that this covers everything for them) exist, and
are to act, 'in Him.' In Him, we find, they
are 'saints' and 'brethren' [i. 1, 14; iv. 1, 2; ii. 29.]; in Him they are to
'stand fast'; to be 'of one mind'; to
'receive one another'; to possess comfort, consolation;
to glory; to rejoice [ii. 1; iii. 1, 3; iv. 4.]. It is
solemnly guaranteed, under certain most holy
and happy conditions, that 'the peace of God
Himself shall'&mdash;the promise is positive&mdash;'keep
safe their hearts and thoughts in
Him' [iv. 7.]; wonderful words, but perfectly distinct.
In them God 'has begun a good work, to be
carried for its completion up to the day of
Christ'; and God is now 'working
in them to will and to do for the sake of'[Pg&nbsp;73]
His plan and purpose [i. 6; ii. 13.]. It is laid upon them
accordingly, in the profound inner rest of such
union, such possession, such submission, to
'work out their salvation,' to live out their life
as the saved, with the 'fear and trembling' of
sacred reverence [ii. 12.]. They are 'to look
each not on his own things,' but on the things
of others, in their Lord's manner [ii. 4.]; to
hold together in loving and courageous union
for the Gospel, standing fast in 'one soul,' under
the 'one Spirit's' power; to keep their
place in the midst of evil surroundings as the
'children of God' [i. 28.] and the 'light-bearers' of 'the
message of life.' [ii. 16.] They are to abstain
totally, in the power of their life in Christ, from
all sin, to 'do nothing' (I take all possible note of
these 'alls' and 'nothings' as I study and classify)
'for strife or vainglory' [ii. 3.]; to be 'anxious
about nothing, but in everything' to tell
God their desires; to 'do all things
without murmurings and disputings' [iv. 6; ii. 14.]; to be
'unblamable, unhurtful, unblemished, God's
children,' not in a dreamland, but in the realities
of Philippian life; to bear fruit, 'fruit
of righteousness, which is through Jesus Christ,' [ii. 15.][Pg&nbsp;74]
and so to bear it that at last it shall turn out, in
the day of the Lord, that they are 'filled' with
it [i. 11.]; every branch is laden. They are
to let their 'moderation,' that is to say their
yieldingness, their self-lessness, come out in
common life, 'known to all men,' in the power
of a 'Lord at hand' [iv. 5.]; to fill their
thoughts with all that is good,
straightforward, chastened, pure [iv. 8.]; to 'mind' the
things in heaven [iii. 20; ii.]; to have 'the mind
of Christ'; to grow in spiritual perception, along
with the growth of love [i. 9.]; to live
the life expressed in that profound summary,
'worshipping God in the Spirit (or, by the
Spirit of God); exulting in Christ Jesus;
having no confidence in the flesh.' [iii. 3.]

"III.&mdash;The Life in Christ exemplified in the
Writer.

"Here let us forget the Apostle, for he
speaks wholly as the Christian, and in a way
manifestly meant to be an instruction to all
Christians. He appears, then, in our document,
as one whom Christ has 'seized,' has
'grasped' [iii. 12.]; as one who has discovered in Christ,
and in Christ alone, the supreme Gain, the[Pg&nbsp;75]
supreme Object of knowledge, the supreme
Spiritual Power as the Risen One [iii. 10.],
the supreme Interest and Reason of
life [i. 20; iii. 7-14], the one possible supply of the unspeakable
need of a valid Righteousness before the Judgment
Seat. Yes, he must be 'found in Him,
having the righteousness which is
from God on terms of faith,' [iii. 9.] the faith which
enters into Christ. 'In Christ,' we discover,
the Writer is, everywhere and always. His
'bonds' are 'in Christ'; his 'glory' is
in Christ' [i. 13, 26.]; his hopes and trusts about the common
events of life are 'in Christ'; in
Christ he has 'found the secret' how to do all,
all he has to do, in peace [iv. 19, 24.]. Christ fills
his present life [iv. 13.]; when he dies, he will be so
'with Christ' that it will be 'far better'
than this present life, though it is full of Christ [i. 21, 23.].
He is the willing but most real bondservant
of Christ [i. 1.]. His relations with Christ
so fill him with peace and the power of peace,
that extremely irritating rivalry and opposition
at Rome does not irritate him, but occasions
holy joy, and the suspense about life
and death in which Nero keeps him is powerless,[Pg&nbsp;76]
wholly because of Christ [i. 12, etc.], to evoke anything
but a statement of the dilemma of blessings
which life and death in the Lord are
to him [i. 21, etc.]. On the other hand, as the whole
Epistle indicates, every pure human sensibility
circulates naturally in this supernatural
atmosphere [E.g. ii. 27, 28; iv. 10.]. And meanwhile, though
'perfect,' in respect of reality of union and
communication with his Lord, he is not yet
'perfected' in respect of application and results;
the goal, the prize, is yet to come. [iii. 12, 14.]

"And so I shut my Epistle to the Philippians,
leaving very much more in it for the
next occasion. Such a study has not demanded
long hours. It has asked only interest, purpose,
and painstaking, a few such fragments of daily
time as we must, yes, must, make and take for
the Bible, if we are not to starve our people
and ourselves. Suffer me to repeat it with
deep earnestness; we must, we absolutely
must, not merely devotionally read but devotionally
search and penetrate this divine Book.
And what shall come of the effort? By the
grace of God, sought in the deep joy of a
profound submission, it shall come that we shall[Pg&nbsp;77]
each one realize, with a vernal newness and
delight, that Christ is mine; that the springs
and secrets of this life in Him are mine, for the
realities of my home, my parish, my study, my
soul. I go (it is for each one of us to say it)
with renewed thirst and certainty to Him the
eternal Fountain; I live, I live, yet not I; and
therefore I can work. It will be 'with fear and
trembling,' as I know myself to be indeed in
the eternal Presence; yet it will be also in the
power-giving 'peace that passeth understanding,
keeping the heart and thoughts, in Christ Jesus,'
a keeping that is not meant to vanish outside
holy places and holy hours, but to do its
strongest and serenest work in the midst of
crookedness and perverseness, under the stress
of toils and burthens, as truly for me to-day as
for the Philippians and their Teacher then."



[Pg&nbsp;78]

"The Spirit breathes upon the Word
And brings the truth to sight;
Precepts and promises afford
A sanctifying light.

"My soul rejoices to pursue
The steps of Him I love,
Till glory breaks upon my view
In brighter worlds above."

Cowper.

CHAPTER IV.CONTENTS

THE DAILY WALK WITH OTHERS (i.).

[Pg&nbsp;80]

When the watcher in the dark
Turns his lenses to the skies,
Suddenly the starry spark
Grows a world upon his eyes:
Be my life a lens, that I
So my Lord may magnify

[Pg&nbsp;81]

We come from the secrecies of the young
Clergyman's life, from his walk alone
with God in prayer and over His Word, to the
subject of his common daily intercourse. Let
us think together of some of the duties, opportunities,
risks, and safeguards of the ordinary
day's experience.

A WALK WITH GOD ALL DAY.

A word presents itself to be said at once,
about the connexion between the secret and
the common walk of the servant of God. The
former is never to give way to the latter; it is
to run into it, underground. "To walk with
God all day" is to be our distinct and practical
purpose, and not merely a sweet sentiment and
holy aspiration of the hymn-book. The man
who prays in secret is to be the man who knows[Pg&nbsp;82]
how to pray secretly in public. The man who
pores over the Word all alone is to be the man
who, out in the open field of life, "sins not"
because he has "hid that Word in
his heart" [Ps. cxix. 11.]; and who, being called upon by
circumstances, however casually, to show himself
actually a true "man of the Book," is
internally ready to do so. Nothing short of
"a life with Christ behind our work," always
and everywhere, is to content us Pastors.
To live that life is from one point of view
our wonderful privilege, in our living union
with our blessed Head. From another point
of view it is our truest and deepest work,
as we watch and pray over our privilege, and
draw upon our Head in the holy diligence of
faith.

I have spoken already of this vital connexion
between the walk with God in secret
and the secret walk with God in public.
But it bears reiteration. It is something
gained if we only remind one another, with
the emphasis of repetition, that such a life
is our bounden duty and our blissful possibility:[Pg&nbsp;83]&mdash;


"You may always be abiding, if you will, at Jesu's side;
In the secret of His Presence you may every moment hide."[10]


[10] I quote from a beautiful hymn, beginning, "In the secret of
His Presence." It is given in part in several recent hymn-books,
but for its complete form see From India's Coral Strand, (Home
Words Office, Paternoster Buildings,) a collection of the poems
of its gifted writer, a Hindoo Christian lady, Miss E.L. Goreh.

But now, what will be the surface and expression
of such a hidden life, as the young
Clergyman passes through his busy common
day?

LIFE IN LODGINGS.

Let me speak first of his life indoors, that
is to say, probably, in his lodgings. There the
day at least begins and ends; and, in more ways
than he is aware of till he sets himself to consider,
he may&mdash;or may not&mdash;glorify his Master
there. He is quite certain to be watched,
whether the eyes are friendly or unfriendly to
himself and to his message and ministry. He
will be watched of course not only as a man
but as a Minister. And the results of the
observation may be most important, for good
or for evil, to the immediate observers; and
they are pretty sure to reach many other people
through them. "What shall the harvest be?"[Pg&nbsp;84]

SELF-RESPECT.

Let one result be, a clear impression in the
house that you, the new Curate, are a man
of self-respect. Perhaps that word will not
be used, any more than its Greek equivalent,
&#945;&#7984;&#948;&#8060;&#962;, that noble pre-Christian ethical term
which lay ready and waiting to be glorified by
the Gospel. But let Self-respect be your principle
and your practice, and it will leave its
impression, by whatever word the impression
may be described. Let the man be seen by
those who are about him, and who in one way
or another wait on him, to be quite simple while
quite refined in ways and habits; to be active
and wholesome in the hours he keeps; to hold
self-indulgence under a strong bridle (shall I
say, not least the self-indulgence which cannot
do without the stimulant and without the pipe?);
and he will be in a fair way to commend his
message indoors. Let him be seen, without
the least affectation, but unmistakably, to find
his main interests, within doors as well as without,
in his Lord and His cause and work; to
be the avowed Christian at all hours; and he
will be doing hourly work for Christ. With it
all, let him be seen to be "gentle to others"[Pg&nbsp;85]
while "to himself severe"; let him, while
always self-respectful, be always watchfully
considerate; and his light will shine; he
will be an &#338;colampadius, a House-light,
indeed.

CONSIDERATENESS.

On that last point I must dilate a little; on
the point of Considerateness. I remember a
conversation a few years ago with one of our
college servants, an excellent Christian woman,
truly exemplary in every duty. She was speaking
of one of my dear student friends now
labouring for the Lord in a distant and difficult
mission-field, and giving him&mdash;after his departure
from us&mdash;a tribute of most disinterested
praise: "Ah, Sir, he was a consistent gentleman!"
And then she instanced some of my
friend's consistencies; and I observed that they
all reduced themselves to one word&mdash;Considerateness.
He was always taking trouble, and
always saving trouble. He was always finding
out how a little thought for others can save
them much needless labour. The things in
question were not heroic. The thoughtfulness
for others concerned only such matters as the
bath, and the shoes, and the clothes, and some[Pg&nbsp;86]
small details of hospitality. But they meant a
very great deal for the hard-worked caretaker,
and they were to her a means of quite distinct
"edification," upbuilding, in the assurance that
Christ and the Gospel are indeed practical
realities. I break no confidence when I add,
by the way, that my friend had not always
been thus "a consistent gentleman." But the
Lord had found him, and he had found
the Lord, in the midst of his University
life; and he had learnt most deeply and effectually,
at the feet of Jesus, the consistency of
Considerateness.

I do press this aspect of our daily walk with
all earnestness on my younger Brethren. I
press it on them at least to think about it with
painstaking attention. No Christian man, as
such, means for one moment to be selfish. But
lack of attention does in very many cases indeed
allow the real Christian to contract, or to continue,
selfish habits. Many good men quite
fail to realize how selfish, practically, it is to be
unpunctual. You have your understood mealtimes
in your lodging. It may not be always
possible to keep strictly to them; the exigencies[Pg&nbsp;87]
of work may make it honestly necessary now
and again to be out of time. But let nothing
less than duty do so for you. The breakfast
kept standing because you are not up when you
should be may very likely mean much needless
trouble and much domestic disarrangement.
Guests often brought in without any notice may
mean the same.

SIMPLICITY AT TABLE.

Perhaps I need not say, yet I will say it, that
the consistent servant of God, whether at his
own table or at his neighbour's, will "take
heed unto himself" not even to seem fastidious.
There are some men about whom, if you know
them, you feel sure that they will not choose the
best dish at the table; and there are others,
I am afraid, about whom you feel pretty sure
that they will. One man will not think, or at
least will not seem to think, whether the meat
is hot or cold; and another will rather decidedly
avoid the latter. Pardon the details; they
have something very real to do with our
Consistency.

USE OF THE TONGUE.

And indeed we have need to ponder Consistency
when we come to "the unruly member."
It is not often, perhaps, that the risks of[Pg&nbsp;88]
the tongue are specially present in a bachelor's
life in lodgings. But they are not absent there.
Friends come in, and we will suppose that you
and they are waited upon at your meal. What
does the servant hear? Much talk about other
and absent persons? Unkind or flippant criticisms?
Idle, frivolous words? Very likely
not, thank God; for we do want to remember
our Lord. But let us take heed. Nothing is
more conspicuously inconsistent in the Christian
than needless, unloving discussion of the
characters and lives of others; nothing is more
keenly noticed when overheard; nothing more
breaks the spell of influence for God.


"Quisquis amat dictis absentum rodere vitam,
Hanc mensam vetitam noverit esse sibi."[11]


[11] Possidonius: De Vit&acirc; Augustini, c. 22.

Such was the memento which St Augustine
had inscribed upon his dining-table. He found
it necessary to remind the Bishops (co&euml;piscopi)
whom he entertained not to misuse their ordained
tongues. And the Pastors of the nineteenth
century need it still, quite as much as
it was needed in the fifth.[Pg&nbsp;89]

"SET A WATCH."

It is impossible, of course, to lay down exhaustive
rules for the Christian guidance of
conversation in detail. It is quite certain that
the Gospel does not prescribe, or intend, that
we should never speak except about things
spiritual, or even except about our special
duties in the Ministry. But it is quite certain
too that the Gospel does prescribe inexorably
the utmost watchfulness and self-discipline in
the matter of the tongue, for all who name the
Name of Christ. "For every idle word that
men shall speak they shall give account" [Matt. xii. 36.];
"Let no corrupt communication proceed
out of your mouth, but such as is
good to the use of edifying, that it may minister
grace unto the hearers" [Eph. iv. 29.]; "If any man among
you seem to be devout (&#952;&#961;&#8134;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#962;), and
bridleth not his tongue, that man's devoutness
(&#952;&#961;&#951;&#954;&#949;&#8055;&#945;) is vain" [Jas. i. 26.]; "Set a watch,
O Lord, before my lips." [Ps. cxli. 3.]

LIFE IN A CLERGY-HOUSE.

I may say a few words in this connexion
about the peculiar call for care and consistency
where a group of young Clergymen live together
in a "clergy-house."

*ITS OPPORTUNITIES AND NEEDS.

It seems to me
that such groups must in the nature of the[Pg&nbsp;90]
case be either means of the greatest good in
the mutual intercourse of their members, or
just the opposite. As sure as corruptio optimi
est pessima, so sure it is that the young Clergyman
who is not consistent in temper, word,
and habit, is the most unhelpful specimen of
the young man; just because of the discord
between his ministerial character and his
personal. And if, say, three or four young
servants of God (by profession) domicile together
and are not consistent, I am afraid they
will positively and actively draw one another,
without in the least meaning to do so, away
from the mind of Christ and the walk with God.
Do they allow themselves to engage in trivial
foolish, unkind talk? Do they so valiantly
determine "not to be goody-goody" as tacitly
to avoid all open-hearted, loving, reverent
conversation about their Lord and His truth?
Are they much fonder of endless argument
than of the Word of God and prayer? Do
their united devotions tend to be formal and
perfunctory? Do they (I come back to that
point again) "bridle not their tongues" about
the absent, about those over them, about those[Pg&nbsp;91]
who differ from them? Then they are doing
each other harm, at a rapid rate, by their
collocation. On the other hand, are they each
for himself living close to their Master and
Friend in the secret chamber and in the inner
heart? Are they walking humbly and gladly
with their God, much in prayer, and having
the Scriptures often open? And are they considering
one another, to provoke unto love and
to good works? Are they remembering generally
and habitually the sacredness of the duty
of mutual influence and example, in personal
habits, and otherwise? Are they determined
each for himself to help his brethren in all
things pure, and just, and lovable, and of
good report, and to strengthen them to
endure hardness, and not to be ashamed of
the blessed Name? Then they are blessing
one another in Christ, as few men otherwise
can do. But personal, individual consistency
is the absolute requisite to this; each man
must follow the Lord for himself in faith
and fear.

THE DUTY OF EXAMPLE.

I spoke just above of the sacredness of the
duty of example. It is a theme on which I[Pg&nbsp;92]
entreat my younger Brethren very often to
reflect, with self-scrutiny before their Master:
I may be wrong, but I cannot help thinking
that here is a duty which is decidedly less
remembered now, among young Christian men,
than it was in other days. With exceptions
many and bright, I yet fear that there is a
decline in this matter as a rule. That unhappy
individualism which is the bane of our day, and
which is the fatal enemy of all true and healthy
individuality, breathes its malaria through even
earnest Christian circles. In the formation or
allowance of personal habits, in particular, it
is sadly common to see young Christian men
practically quite forgetful of the power and
responsibility of example. I do not think that
this was quite so common twenty or thirty
years ago. Not that I wish to take up the
futile part of a mere laudator temporis acti; I
believe that the phenomenon has its reasons,
its law so to speak, in the peculiar conditions
of our day. But then the Christian man is
never to be the slave of the conditions of his
day, while he is to "serve his own
generation by the will of God." [Acts xiii. 36.] So I appeal[Pg&nbsp;93]
most urgently to my reader, if he should chance
to need the friendly call, to awake to a renewed
attention to the responsibility of example, and
to watch accordingly over consistency in everything.

"FOR THEIR SAKES."

With the humblest reverence may I quote in
this connexion the words of our blessed Lord
in the High Priestly Prayer? "For their
sakes I sanctify Myself." [John xvii. 19.] So said
Jesus Christ. Perfectly holy personally, He
was yet always deliberately hallowing Himself,
separating Himself, to the Father's will and
work, "for their sakes"; because of His relations
with His disciples. Shall not we sinners,
at whatever interval, yet really, "follow His
steps" in this also? "For their sakes," for the
sake of our brethren in the Ministry, for the
sake of our servants, for the sake of our neighbour
of all sorts and kinds, let us "sanctify
ourselves" in a daily, willing separation from
the way of self to the will of God, diligently
seeking the expression of that will in His holy
Word. It is the duty of every Christian. It
is par excellence the duty of every Christian
Minister, from the oldest Archbishop to the[Pg&nbsp;94]
youngest Deacon. To take Orders is to renounce
all ideas of a selfishly private life. Our
whole life henceforth is "for their sakes";
even in those parts of it which must, from
another point of view, be most jealously protected
from officialism, and lived as if for the
time no one existed but the man and his God.
We are emphatically now "their bondmen for
Jesus' sake." [2 Cor. iv. 5.] "Others" have now
an indefeasible right not only to our ministry
of Ordinances, and to our preaching, and our
visiting, but to the example of our habits, of
our lives.

MANNER.

Following up the same line of remark, let
me say a word about our duty to others in the
matter of manner. It is sometimes, surely, forgotten
by Christian men that they have no right
to be careless of their manner. Many an excellent
and otherwise consistent Clergyman seems
to assume that, whether with his brethren or
with his parish neighbours, his manner may
take care of itself, if he only "does not mean
it." But well-meaning is a poor substitute for
well-doing; especially that otiose sort of well-meaning
which only means not meaning ill.[Pg&nbsp;95]
["NOBLESSE OBLIGE."] Christians have no business with so poor and
thin a phantom of virtue. They are not at
liberty not to think about a kindly courtesy
of address, and a manly deference towards
elders, and watchful "honour" given
to woman [1 Pet. iii. 7.], and a manifested (as well as felt)
sympathy of heart with all who ask it. They
are forbidden by the whole will and rights of
their Master to be loud and "casual" in intercourse;
to be moody and uncertain; to be
difficult to please, easy to offend; to think it
a small thing to speak the word to others
which may wound, even lightly, with any
wound but the really "faithful" one of a loving
caution or reproof in Christ. No one is to be
so independent in one aspect as the Christian
man, and particularly the Christian Minister.
Few men have so strong a vantage-ground for
independence as the Clergyman of the English
national Church. But it is the sort of independence
which carries also the deepest obligation,
the strongest sort of noblesse oblige. It is "for
their sakes." And so the same man is bound to
be also the most accessible, the most attentive,
the most courteous and sympathetic. Avoid[Pg&nbsp;96]ing
carefully, of course, all affectation and
unreality, he is to take care that a Christian
reality within does show itself in a Christian
manner without. "Let your moderation, your
oblivion of self, be known unto all
men." [Phil. iv. 5.] Let it be seen and felt, in your rooms,
in your parish, in your church.

TEMPER.

Obviously this takes for granted the Clergyman's
recognition of the call to "rule
his spirit." [Prov. xvi. 32.] The temptation not to do so is
very different for different men. One man
finds temper and patience sorely tried by things
which do not even attract the attention of
another. But very few men indeed, in the
actual experiences of pastoral life, whether in
town or country, quite escape for long together
the stings which irritate and inflame. But
they must learn how to meet them in peace
and patience, unless they would take one of the
most certain ways to dishonour their Master
and discredit their message. The world has
some very true instincts about the power of the
Gospel, as it ought to be, as it claims to be.
And one of them is that a Christian as such is
a man who ought always to keep his temper.[Pg&nbsp;97]
The Christian Clergyman is most certainly, at
least in an ironical sense, "expected" never
to be personally vexed and hot. Will it be
so? Will he take ignorant rudeness pleasantly,
should it cross his way? Will he meet opposition
patiently, however firmly? Will he
show that he remembers the text, "The
bondservant of the Lord must not
strive"? [2 Tim. ii. 24.]

THE REV. C. SIMEON.

That text was the watchword of a great
man of God, the Rev. Charles Simeon, in the
early and exquisitely trying experiences of his
long ministry (1782-1836) at Trinity Church,
Cambridge. The parishioners shut their house-doors
in his face, and locked their pew-doors
against those who came to hear him. Every
form of irritating parochial obstruction was
employed. And the young Clergyman had by
nature a very short temper, and a very fearless
spirit. But he had found peace through the
blood of the Cross a few years before, and
the interests of his Saviour were become all
in all to him. So his first thought was, what
would best commend Jesus Christ to the angry
people? And the words seemed to sound[Pg&nbsp;98]
constantly in his soul, by way of answer, "The
servant of the Lord must not strive." Never
was tried patience more beautifully made perfect.
He was always giving way, and always
going on. He carefully ascertained that it
was illegal to lock the pew-doors; but he did
not take the law of those who locked them.
His soul was kept in peace; and by degrees,
as might be expected, a calmness which clearly
was not cowardice but consistency won a victory
whose effects are felt to this day through
the whole Church of England in the results of
Simeon's mighty influence.[12]

[12] I may be permitted to refer to my brief sketch of Mr Simeon's
Life: Charles Simeon (Methuen, 1892), ch. iv.

THE SECRET OF PEACE.

How shall we, in our measure, whenever
called to it, "not strive," but "let our oblivion
of self be known unto all men"&mdash;in the cottage,
in the villa, in the vestry? There is only one
way. It is by abiding in the Secret of the
Presence, in the "pavilion" where "the strife
of tongues" may be heard indeed, but cannot,
no, cannot, set the hearer on fire. We must
claim on our knees, very often, our Master's[Pg&nbsp;99]
power to keep the soul which He has made,
and which longs to manifest Him



"In faith, in meekness, love,
In every beauteous grace,
From glory thus to glory changed
As we behold His face."



POWER OF A CONSISTENT LIFE.

I have inevitably touched only some parts
of the great subject of personal ministerial Consistency.
More will be said later. But the
treatment on paper, at almost any length, must
be incomplete at the best; many an important
side of the subject will need to be omitted. My
aim has been, and will be, to speak of those
sides most, if not only, which are in special
danger of neglect at the present day; and this
means of course the passing by of some large
topics.

PAINS AND MEANS.

But contributions, however fragmentary, to
the study of Consistency will not be in vain.
"A Minister's life is the life of his ministry,"
says some one of other days with pithy force.
"Happy those labourers of the Church," says
blessed Quesnel, the Jansenist (on Mark vi. 33),
"the sweet odour of whose lives draws the
people to Jesus Christ." We all recognize the[Pg&nbsp;100]
beauty and truth of such sayings. We all
admit the fitness and duty of Consistency. But
we must also recollect that in order to our consistency
there is needed more than an abstract
approbation; we must attend, we must reflect,
we must examine ourselves, we must discipline
ourselves, as those who aim at an object at
once lovely and necessary. Above all, we must
order our steps in our Lord's Word," [Ps. cxix. 133.]
and we must maintain a living communion of
spirit with our Lord Himself, who is not only
our Exemplar, our Law, and our King, but
also our Secret, our Strength, our Life.



[Pg&nbsp;101]
CHAPTER V.CONTENTS

THE DAILY WALK WITH OTHERS (ii.).

[Pg&nbsp;102]
If Jesus Christ thou serve, take heed,
Whate'er the hour may be;
His brethren are obliged indeed
By their nobility.

[Pg&nbsp;103]

In the present chapter I follow the general
principles of the last into some further
details. And I place before me as a sort of
motto those twice-repeated words of the Apostle,
Take Heed unto Thyself.

These words, it will be remembered, are addressed
in both places to the Christian
Minister [Acts xx. 28; 1 Tim. iv. 6.]. At Miletus St Paul gathers
round him the Presbyters of Ephesus, and implores
them to take heed to themselves, and
to the flock. A few years later he writes to
Timothy, commissioned (whether permanently
or not) to be Pastor of Pastors in that same
Ephesus, and lays it on his soul to take heed
to himself, and to the doctrine. In each case
the appeal to attend to "self" comes first, as
the vital preliminary to the other. And in each[Pg&nbsp;104]
case it takes the form of a solemn warning; not
only "remember" but "take heed."

TAKE HEED UNTO THYSELF.

I have already tried to emphasize the duty
of "heed-taking," in several directions. But
I come in this chapter to some important
matters which seem specially to fall under
such a heading; matters in which the lack
of prayerful heed may, and often does, work
great and even fatal mischief in the lives of
Clergymen.

RELATIONS WITH WOMAN.

i. Let me first say a little, in brotherly confidence
and candour, about the young Clergyman's
relations with Woman in ordinary intercourse.

It would be waste of words to talk about the
delicacy of the subject; it is self-evident. And
it is obvious also that in a book like this the
subject can be treated only in the way of
general suggestion; no vain attempt shall I
make to state and discuss possible exceptional
cases of social difficulty. But it is quite necessary
to say something on this matter, for it
is indeed a pressing and important thing in
ministerial life.

I will begin, then, with the assumption that
the young Clergyman recognizes, and seeks to[Pg&nbsp;105]
practise, the great Gospel principle of a sanctified
chivalry. "To the feminine vessel, as to
the weaker, give honour," writes
St Peter [1 Pet iii. 7.]; words which must be cut large and
deep into our ministerial hearts if we are to
live as true Ministers and true men. They
have a particular reference to married life, I
know; but their full scope is far wider. And
they are among the most wonderful utterances
of the apostolic Gospel, when we read them in
the light, or rather under the contrasted darkness,
of the contemporary anti-chivalry of the
Rabbinic teaching about woman. They are
the utterance of Peter, the married man, after
his discipleship in the Spirit at the feet of
Jesus, the Mother's Son. "Giving honour;"
do not forget the phrase. It lifts us into a
higher and far healthier region than that of
either mere fondness or mere admiration. Indeed,
it is all-important to remember what a
deep gulph lies between two things which at
first sight may be mistaken for one another&mdash;Admiration
for Women, Reverence for Woman.

So let apostolic chivalry, unaffected, but
watchful and practical, govern your life, by the[Pg&nbsp;106]
grace of God. Let it be quite impartial as
a principle. You may possibly have to speak
with a princess; you are sure to have to
speak and deal with very poor and ignorant
women. But each and all they are Woman,
and you must remember the Apostle's word.
Courtesy and consideration are due to them
all, as you are a man, a Christian, a Minister
of God. The expression may vary, and
within limits it must, but the principle must
be always there. To the poorest woman give
the wall in the street, offer the best seat in
the train.

WE ARE TRUSTED.

I must here so far anticipate a future chapter
as to point out how constantly this call to
"give honour" must be remembered in pastoral
visitation. We Clergy are trusted to an extraordinary
degree in personal intercourse with
female parishioners. How often a pastoral call
is paid, whether at mansion or cottage, when no
man is at home! "Take heed unto thyself"
then. The call under those circumstances
should be as brief as possible. And the whole
interview should be ruled by a heedful while
unobtrusive respect and self-respect. Do not[Pg&nbsp;107]
think a strong word of caution in this matter
out of place and out of scale. Carelessness of
even appearances here may wreck a life; it
may certainly blight an influence.

WHEN AND HOW TO TAKE HEED.

But I do not forget that we are not yet concerned
directly with pastoral visitation as such;
we are thinking of incidental social intercourse.
The young Clergyman will sometimes, however
seldom, find himself visiting in not exactly the
pastoral sense of the word. Courteous hospitality
will be shown him by neighbours; and
while he will very often decline these calls,
because his Master's work in other and more
obvious forms claims him, sometimes he will
accept them, as his Master did. Or his needful
holiday has come, and he is staying at a
friend's house, or is thrown into new intercourse
at some health-resort. And we will
suppose that he is a bachelor, and not engaged.
In what particular directions shall he
take heed?

"KNOW THYSELF."

Below and above all details, he will take
heed to remember his always present Lord and
Friend, and to live and talk as knowing that
"He is the unseen Listener to every conversa[Pg&nbsp;108]tion";
a recollection which ought to banish from
our talk, whether we talk with man or woman,
alike frivolity, unkindness, untruthfulness, and
dulness. Then, to come to a few details under
that great principle&mdash;the man will need to watch
and be heedful in one or more quite different
directions, according to his character. And God
grant us all such honesty and simplicity before
Him as shall teach us to know at least something
of our own characters, especially in their
weak points. There ought to be no surer
prescription for a true &#947;&#957;&#8182;&#952;&#953; &#963;&#949;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#8057;&#957; than to
walk in the light" [1 John i. 7.] of the presence
of Him who sees everything just as it is, and
in that light to look at ourselves, and the world,
and His Word; aiming every day, not to be
thought "nice," or to be thought remarkable,
but to let Him shine out of our lives.

THE DUTY OF RESERVE.

One man, then, will need more than another
to cultivate a quiet reserve and restraint of
manner in social intercourse with young ladies.
It is the way of some men, without thinking
about it, to be too demonstratively attentive.
It is the way of others to forget that they are
not everywhere at home, and to be far too[Pg&nbsp;109]
familiarly friendly. "I look on every girl I
meet as if she were my sister;" so said one
young Clergyman, a very fine fellow indeed,
but certainly in this sentiment very much and
very dangerously mistaken. Attentions and
confidences may be meant as honestly as possible.
But if they go beyond a certain line
(soon reached) they may most naturally be
thought to mean something more; to be a
preliminary, however distant, to an offer. And
just possibly such a thought may not be unwelcome
to the other person concerned. And if
so, and if all the while nothing but courtesy
was meant, you, my friend and Brother, without
knowing it, perhaps without ever knowing
it, may spoil the life of one who cannot possibly,
as a woman, express herself to you. I have
known such a case in clerical life. The man
was a true man, but he allowed himself, for the
pleasantness of it, to be very agreeable where
he meant no more than friendship. Great,
while silent, was the sorrow that resulted. Take
heed unto thyself.

SPECIAL RISKS.

There are some parochial circumstances
where even unusual caution is needed in this[Pg&nbsp;110]
direction; for reasons which I allude to with
pain. It is a fact, I fear, that in some parishes
the Curate is in danger of being rather actively
pursued, by here and there a parent, as a possibly
desirable son-in-law. I have even heard
of a certain Incumbent who was given not indistinctly
to understand that the coming Curate
would be less welcome if he was a man already
married. Such a state of things is of course
one of exceptional social risk and difficulty for
a Curate, and for a young single Rector or
Vicar still more so. Nothing will do but a
very real "heed-taking," beginning always in
secret with God, and then quietly carried out
with sanctified common-sense. Fatal mistakes,
really fatal to future usefulness in the Ministry,
may very easily be made otherwise.

But then there is an opposite side to the
question. Some young men, not all certainly
but a good many, are in great danger of a
rather exaggerated estimate of their own attractions
and importance. There are some junior
Clergymen who are, if I do not mistake, prone
to think that most young ladies whom they
meet are fascinated by them, or are at least in[Pg&nbsp;111]
imminent peril. Such delusions meet sometimes
with not very gentle corrections. But it
is better to be forearmed against the delusion&mdash;as
it most probably is a delusion in the
given case. And the best prophylactic is the
old one; a secret walk with God "in the light,"
and a recollection of the constant need of self-knowledge
exactly where such knowledge is
least pleasant. I repeat it; may the Lord
grant us each and every one His true &#947;&#957;&#8182;&#952;&#953; &#963;&#949;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#8057;&#957;.
By a blessed paradox it is sure to
prove the secret of a true self-oblivion; for it
means for certain, among other things, a truer
and fuller sight of Him.

MATRIMONY OR CELIBACY?

The subject thus before us is a very large
one. It connects itself with the whole question
whether marriage or celibacy is the will of God
in the man's ministerial life. Happily I have
no need, in the Church of England, to defend
"the holy estate of matrimony" as if it were
in the slightest measure incompatible with the
fullest sanctification of life and of ministry.
Personally my belief is that, in the immense
majority of cases, the married Clergyman is
the more useful Clergyman if (an "if" of[Pg&nbsp;112]
extreme importance) his wife is altogether one
with him in the Lord. But I distinctly think
that there are very many exceptions to the
matrimonial rule. There are branches of
ministerial work, particularly in parts of the
sacred missionary field, where the single man
seems to make the better Minister. And no
true servant of God will allow himself to think
first of an opening for marriage and then of an
opening for ministry.

"ONE IN THE LORD."

Here I pause to say what it lies much on my
heart to say somewhere. Let the true man,
who is at present free in respect of marriage-engagements,
resolve that in the whole question
of seeking or not seeking a wife he will
consider first, midst, and last his Master's work,
his Master's Ministry. Better a thousand times
be the most solitary of human beings than
choose with your eyes open a married life in
which you will not find positive help (not
merely no positive hindrance) in your work
for the Lord Jesus Christ. Beware of the
temptation to seek the mere pretty face, or
the mere fortune large or small, or mere accomplishments,
or indeed anything short of[Pg&nbsp;113]
the truly converted believing heart and dedicated
will.

*MARRIED LIFE AS IT SHOULD BE.

The Clergyman and his Wife are
sacredly bound to live their united life wholly
for Christ. They are to help one another
on in Him, to stimulate one another in work
for others in Him, to give each other always
mutual aid towards a constant growth in faith,
hope, and love; towards an ever better use of
means, and time, and tongue, and everything.
If their Lord gives them children to train for
Him, those children are to see their parents
so living, not only individually but together, as
to glorify and commend the Gospel to them,
from the very first. And the wider family of
the parish, sure to be observant, is to see the
same sight in measure. Happy the married
Pastor whose home and its life respond to
such a description. Alas for the man whose
passion, blindness, hurry, self-will, or whatever
else it is, has betrayed him into a condition of
things which cannot be so described.

I may be writing for some readers to whom
such a "take heed unto thyself" may be in
point even as they read. If so, let me seize
the occasion. With not a few very sorrowful[Pg&nbsp;114]
illustrations in my mind I lay all emphasis on
this earnest word of affectionate warning. And
let me add to it another word, as in duty bound,
and with the utmost solemnity, knowing that
the thing is vitally important. I appeal to you
not lightly to seek marriage, not lightly to
make engagement, even where you have good
assurance that all would be spiritually well, if
there is a real probability of a married life
clogged with pecuniary perplexities.

You observe that I do not speak absolutely
on this point; I dare not. I do not say,
Do not do it; I say, Do not lightly do
it. Faith is one thing; "light-heartedness"
is another. And sometimes light-heartedness
means nothing better than a vague expectation
that "something will turn up." Perhaps what
does turn up is a weary and distracting struggle
with debt, and a gradual habituation to a not
very creditable life upon the means of others,
who very likely can spare only with difficulty
what comes at length to be taken without gratitude.
I beseech my Brother to "suffer the
word of exhortation."

RISKS OF DEBT.

ii. I touch thus already on the second[Pg&nbsp;115]
point about which I would fain cry, Take heed
unto thyself. That matter is Money. A few
words here will sufficiently convey my appeal,
but those few must be pressing. I appeal to
my younger Brethren to be watchful day by
day in the matter of money. At this moment
there rises in my memory the face and name
of a Clergyman with whom, long years ago,
I became acquainted about the time of his
ordination. He was unquestionably in earnest;
I believe that he truly knew his Lord and
Master, and was truly desirous to serve Him
in His flock. But I am perfectly sure that he
must have forgotten, almost from the first, to
take heed unto himself in the matter of money.

*PECUNIARY INTEMPERANCE.

Perhaps he had brought with him from the
University that fatal habit of pecuniary intemperance
which sometimes gets a hold upon a
man second in its grasp only to that of intemperance
commonly so called. Unhappily the
ways of modern college life too easily generate
such a habit, as University men are led more
and more by their surroundings into a dread
of appearing to be poor, and are almost expected
to cost their fathers more for the[Pg&nbsp;116]
academical year of eight or nine months than
they will earn in the clerical year of twelve.
But however it was, my poor dear friend had
about him the tendency to debt. And not all
his earnestness and his devoutness could maintain
his influence when that tendency began
to tell. One post of duty had to be soon
quitted for another, and so again and again,
under this ever-recurring failure. Let us take
heed unto ourselves.

PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MONEY.

In dealing with money which in any sense
is public, no care can be too great. In a case
well known to me, a Clergyman imperilled his
whole influence, to the verge of ruin, by the
simple but effectual process of allowing money
collected for a church-object to be mixed and
"muddled" with his private funds. He was
not business-like, and he was not at all well off.
And somehow, when the time of reckoning
came, the money had melted, he knew not
whither. Strenuous exertions on the part of
friends replaced privately the missing collection;
but it was only just in time. I have
often heard our Indian Missionaries say how
great and frequent is the difficulty raised by[Pg&nbsp;117]
the apparent incapacity of some otherwise excellent
native Pastors to keep public and private
money apart. They mean all that is honourable;
but a friend comes in begging for a loan,
and there is the church fund at hand, and of
course the sum taken shall be soon repaid, and
of course it is not repaid. But such difficulties
are not confined to India. The native Pastors
of England have great need to take heed unto
themselves.

THE ACCOUNTS IN GOOD ORDER.

If possible, let us make our lay parochial
friends our secretaries, and above all our treasurers.
But if it must be otherwise, and often
it must be, let us take heed, at any cost of
pains. To do so may be overruled to win a
positive influence for the Clergyman. I well
remember a dear friend of mine telling me,
with loyal pleasure, of his holy and devoted
Vicar's care in this direction, and its power
over the keen-sighted and not always friendly
members of the school-committee in his great
parish. Every item of the books was accurate;
every halfpenny of receipts accounted for. Men
could find no fault in that Clergyman save concerning
the Law&mdash;and the Gospel&mdash;of his God.[Pg&nbsp;118]

INVESTMENT-CIRCULARS.

Perhaps I need only allude in passing to
that crude sort of temptation put so freely
before us Clergy, the circular advertisement
of the mine which is to pay twenty per cent.,
or of the company just formed (I have such
a circular in my possession, and keep it
sacredly,) to promote the construction of a
new projectile which shall make war more
horrible than ever; one condition to the success
of the Clergyman's investment being, of course,
that war, thus made more horrible than ever,
shall also be as frequent and continuous as
possible. But the schemes announced in these
circulars are very various in character; good,
indifferent, and bad. Need I say that, as a
very safe rule, they must all be viewed as
bad from the point of view of the young
Clergyman's (or indeed of the Clergyman's)
purse? It is a truism to remark that high
interest means low security; but even a truism
can bear occasional repetition when it has to
do with a good man's whole life and work,
and when the oblivion may mean acute or
chronic misery. Such investments are for us
a form of gambling, almost as much so as[Pg&nbsp;119]
the shameless circulars which we sometimes
receive from foreign cities, announcing the
possibility of clearing a fortune at one stroke
by a turn of the lottery machine. Does the
sending of such missives to the English Clergy
mean that English Clergymen sometimes
answer them? If so, I say that it is strictly
impossible that the man who so answers,
whether he loses or wins, can also be walking
with God, and so working that the Lord works
with him. So far as such acts go, he is acting
an awfully untrue part, and his Master knows
it. Let us take heed unto ourselves.

OTHER MONEY-PERILS.

In conclusion, I turn another way. The
whole question of the increase and investment
of money is a very solemn and searching one
for the Christian, clerical or lay. There are
holy men who say that we ought in no degree
to "lay up." While I reverence their meaning,
I do not agree with them. Yet I do
most deeply feel that their warnings raise a
danger-signal in a direction opposite to that
which we have been viewing, but equally
important. Some of my younger Brethren
have already a private competency; others[Pg&nbsp;120]
may be expecting one.

*"WHEN RICHES INCREASE."

To others, gifted in
one way or another for marked acceptance
in the Church, posts are, or will be, offered
which even in these days bring a good income,
perhaps a growing one. Take heed unto
thyself. It is with deep significance that the
Word of God bids us not set our
heart upon riches when they increase [Ps. lxii. 10.]. It is
often observed, I fear, that a man's readiness to
give diminishes in proportion to his power for
giving. There is a subtle fascination for many
minds, and among them for minds generous
at first, in an access of possessions; the thirst
for more sets in, however imperceptibly, and
perhaps the Christian, perhaps the Pastor,
has become&mdash;before he knows it&mdash;covetous;
caring a good deal for money. Let us take
heed unto ourselves.[13]

[13] I cannot help relating a pathetically amusing remark I once
heard in a Dorsetshire cottage. I had looked in on the good
housewife in the course of a long walk, and she was telling me
about the needs and straits of a recent time of illness. The
aged Vicar of the large and thinly-peopled parish was a well-to-do
man, and not at all unkind in meaning and manner. But he
never gave alms, or indeed material help of any kind. "Poor
Mr&mdash;&mdash;," said the cottager, with the kindliest na&iuml;vet&eacute;, "he never
do give away anything. There, I suppose it be his affliction."[Pg&nbsp;121]

"LAY NOT UP FOR YOURSELVES."

I am sure that the Gospel has no censure
for modest comforts and for simple refinements.
I am sure that it bids the Christian, whether
Pastor or not, "provide," look beforehand,
with a view to save needless anxiety and
disadvantage both for himself and yet more
"for them of his own house." [1 Tim. v. 8.] But I am
equally sure that it commands us even more
emphatically not to lay up treasure upon earth;
not to make the sad mistake of thinking that
the work of life is to get. Rather may ours
be the spirit of a noble-hearted friend of
mine, now at rest for ever, early called away
from heroic Missionary work. He had found
himself rapidly getting richer in a successful
school-enterprize; and recognized in this a
summons to give it up, and volunteer for the
foreign field.

But I say no more. Probably to the great
majority of my readers these last paragraphs
seem little to the purpose, at least at present.
But there are few lives in which, sooner or
later, such reflections may not find a corner
for application.

THE MOTIVE.

Meanwhile, whether our call is to avoid[Pg&nbsp;122]
debt or to avoid gathering, we will look up
for new motive power into our Master's face.
Him we love; Him we long to commend; and
to Him we belong with all we have. In His
Name, and for His sake, we will take heed
unto ourselves.



[Pg&nbsp;123]
CHAPTER VI.CONTENTS

THE DAILY WALK WITH OTHERS (iii.).

[Pg&nbsp;124]

Thrice happy they who at Thy side,
Thou Child of Nazareth,
Have learnt to give their struggling pride
Into Thy hands to death:
If thus indeed we lay us low,
Thou wilt exalt us o'er the foe;
And let the exaltation be
That we are lost in Thee.

[Pg&nbsp;125]

Let me say a little on a subject which, like
the last, is one of some delicacy and difficulty,
though its problems are of a very different
kind. It is, the relation between the Curate
and his Incumbent; or more particularly, the
Curate's position and conduct with regard to
the Incumbent.

A LECTURE ON CURATES.

I need not explain that the legal aspect of
this important matter is not in my view. Not
long ago I listened, in the library of Ridley
Hall, to an instructive lecture, by a diocesan
Chancellor, on the law of Curates; one of a
series on Church Law delivered under the sanction
of the University. The Lecturer informed
the audience, certainly he informed me, of many
points of practical moment not clearly known
to us before. He gave a sketch of the history[Pg&nbsp;126]
of the licensed Curate as an institution, and
made us aware that he is a modern institution,
comparatively speaking. Before the Reformation
the numerous host of "chantry-priests"
was largely used to supplement the offices of
the parochial Clergy. After the Reformation,
for a very long while, the pastoral arrangements
did not include a special institution of Assistants.
Then, as the unhappy system of
pluralities grew large and common, such as
it was all through the eighteenth century and
beyond it, "the Curate" meant not the active
assistant of the resident Pastor but the substitute
for the non-resident&mdash;the Curate-in-Charge.
It was not till well within these last
hundred years that men were commonly to be
found doing what we now understand so well
as Assistant-Curates' work. The presence in
the Church of us Assistant-Curates (I hold a
licence myself, and am therefore one of the
company) is at once an effect and a sign both
of the great increase of population and of the
concurrent increase throughout the Church of
England of the desire for fuller and more
laborious ministrations.[Pg&nbsp;127]

A CHANCELLOR'S SUGGESTIONS.

So our able Lecturer led us through our
own history; and then he proceeded to instruct
us in some main elements of our legal
qualifications, and duties, and rights: how to
get into a Curacy, and how to get out of
it; what are the Bishop's rights over the
Curate, and how the Archbishop may interpose
if the Curate pleads a grievance against the
Bishop. But I trust that this and other
Lectures of the same course may see the
light some day in a better form than a rough
and passing report of mine. My purpose in
referring to them now is that I may call attention
to one point on which the Lecturer laid
no little stress. It was, that it is the wisdom
of the Curate, when he has once deliberately
accepted a Curacy, to be thoroughly loyal all
along; to consider himself as "at the Vicar's
beck and call"; to serve him heartily and
unreservedly. If tempted to do otherwise,
particularly if tempted to complain of the Vicar
to the Bishop, let him resist that temptation to
the utmost of his power. "There may be sad
exceptions, and necessity knows no law; but
as a rule," said my honoured friend, "I may[Pg&nbsp;128]
assure you, from a large experience, that the
Curate who complains of his Incumbent to
his Bishop injures not the Incumbent but
himself."

LOYALTY.

Our Lecturer avowedly spoke not as a
spiritual but as a legal counsellor. I would
now take up his words, and from the point of
view of the friend and Brother in the Lord say
a little to my younger Brethren, engaged or
about to be engaged in assistant Curacies,
concerning the Christian rightness and Christian
wisdom of taking the sort of line which the
diocesan Chancellor recommended.

THE IDEAL INCUMBENT.

As I come to the subject, let me say on the
threshold that I am sure to be writing for many
readers who little need the discourse, at least
at present. You are working under a Vicar
or a Rector whose example and also whose
friendship is one of the greatest blessings of
your life. You see in him a man perhaps much
older than yourself, perhaps nearly your coeval,
but however a leader, who is also, in the Lord
Jesus Christ, your brother, and your most considerate
while stimulating friend. He consults
you, without forgetting his responsibility of[Pg&nbsp;129]
ultimate direction. He gladly and fully recognizes
and honours your work done under his
organization. He has not the slightest wish to
come between you and the affections of his
parishioners among whom you move. He
cultivates, in his busy life, Christian fellowship
with you in private; you pray together, and
talk together, not only about the parish but
about the Lord, and the Word, and your
own souls. He lets you find in him, as he
is glad to find in you, just a man, a friend,
a Christian, with trials and blessings of inner
experience on which it is sometimes good
to speak to one another; a living soul, companionable
and human, while in it Christ
dwells by faith. You have experienced with
happy uniformity your Incumbent's patience,
sympathy, fairness, trustworthiness. You have
seen in him one who is himself always at work,
always watching for the flock; who does not
put on you this duty or that merely because
it is irksome to himself, but whose whole
purposes are in the cause of God, and who
distributes labour in any and every interest but
his own.[Pg&nbsp;130]

And perhaps you see this man honoured
and loved by all around you, as they too see
and know him to be what he is. You move
about in the parish, and you are quite sure
to hear allusions to the Vicar. And as a rule,
perhaps, they are all friendly, all loyal, all
grateful. You find yourself, in short, under
no appreciable present temptation, being (as of
course you are) a true man yourself, to do
anything but identify yourself very gladly
with him.

YET EVEN HE IS NOT PERFECT.

But then, even in this bright supposed case&mdash;a
case of which the Church of England
contains hundreds of practical examples, thank
God&mdash;appreciable temptations in the other
direction, the wrong, unhappy, fatal direction,
may very conceivably creep upon you with
time. Your admirable Incumbent is all the
while a mortal man, and as such, most certainly
(he himself above all men knows and
owns it), he is not perfect, not quite equal to
himself in every way. Perhaps he has come
to be not perfect in physical health, and thus he
is obliged, to his own grief, to do less in this
or that branch of activity than some of his[Pg&nbsp;131]
people think he ought to do; and then you
are tolerably sure to hear some not very just
and generous complaints in the parish. Perhaps
domestic sorrow, or domestic straits and
care, may have come in to becloud his spirit
and to make his energies for a season flag.
Perhaps among his many gifts you may find
some gift a little lacking; he may be manifestly
less strong in the committee, or in the labours
of arrangement generally, than in the pulpit
or the class; or it may be just the other way.
And you, my dear friend, may be (or may
think yourself to be) somewhat strong where
he is somewhat weak; an opportunity for many
subtle temptations. The days and weeks go
on; and if you let "the little rift" of criticism
widen, and do not continually take it to your
Lord to be examined and mended, other
feelings&mdash;not born from above&mdash;may steal in
between you and this good man, your elder
and leader in Christ. Petty dislikes and impatience
may rise in your heart about some
trifling point of manner, some momentary failure
of sympathy, some oblivion of arrangement
or engagement due to a sore stress[Pg&nbsp;132]
of work, some very small matter of Church
order, or Christian dialect; or who can tell
what?

GRAVE POSSIBLE TEMPTATIONS TO DISLOYALTY.

But also it is just possible that I am writing
for some reader who finds himself in more
grave and pressing difficulties than these. My
most honoured brethren the Incumbents, if
any of them should cast their eyes over these
chapters, written by a Curate mainly for
Curates, will not blame me for saying that
there are cases, sad and sorrowful, where the
Curate cannot honestly think with perfect happiness
of his leader's work and influence. Perhaps
that Incumbent has "run well," nobly
well, but (as it was of old with some
primitive saints) something or someone "hindered
him." [Gal. v. 7.] Perhaps he has lost first love
and zeal, and sunk, he knows not how, into
an indolent clericalism, or anticlericalism, of
thought and habit. Perhaps he has suffered
care, disappointment, parochial conflicts, to
sour his spirit, or at least to take his heart
away from his people. Perhaps he has felt
the sad influence of controversial battles, and
the love and richness of the old Gospel has[Pg&nbsp;133]
somewhat faded out of his life, and conversation,
and sermons; I do not refer to faithful
care over distinctive and world-offending
truth, but to the controversial spirit, which
is altogether another thing. Perhaps he has
somewhat lost command over temper; perhaps
he has not yet found in our Lord's great
fulness the open secret by which He supplies
patience to His servants, even when they are
sorely vexed by man. And just possibly difficulty
between Curate and Vicar threatens to
arise from some side-quarter; from those who
stand around the Vicar, who inevitably see
him often and intimately, who are active and
important under-workers in his field, and who
may themselves be not quite fully "governed
by the Spirit and Word of God."

BEWARE OF THE GROWTH OF A CURATE'S PARTY.

I have put a good many supposed cases.
How much I should rejoice if I could know
that not one reader of this page could find
any of my "peradventures" the least in point
within his experience. But I must emphasize
one of them which is hardly a peradventure
at all; namely that the Curate is practically
certain, sooner or later, to find temptations[Pg&nbsp;134]
presented to his loyalty by the conversation
of parishioners. There is not one parish in
all England where everybody is pleased with
the Incumbent; pleased always and about
everything. And if the given Vicar or Rector
employs a Curate, and if that Curate is you,
it will be a moral miracle if you never hear
of such discontents. You will hear of them,
very probably, in ways which will offer you,
however faintly, an opportunity of acting towards
your chief a little as Absalom
acted towards David when he expressed certain
pious wishes that he were made judge in the
land in his father's place [2 Sam. xv. 1-6.]. I do not for a
moment mean that you are, or ever will be,
a man of treacherous purposes; the Lord
forbid. But if you do not watch, and are not
in some measure forewarned, you may easily
be betrayed unawares, quite unawares, into
speech or into action which will practically be
treacherous to the man who is over you in
Christ, and so toward Christ's work and cause
in the parish where you serve. Do you not
know the possibilities to which I refer? Have
they not crossed either your own path or that[Pg&nbsp;135]
of some Curate-friend of yours? Is there no
such thing as an intimacy formed by the Curate
in some house where the Incumbent is not
liked, and is that intimacy never used by the
Curate not for the noblest ends? Is there
no weak listening to parochial gossip on the
Curate's part? Is there never any allowance
by the younger man of a growth around him,
in ways which he could stop summarily, if he
tried, of a certain unwholesome sort of preference
and popularity? Is it not sometimes
known that a Curate condescends so low as
to concur with criticisms or sarcasms on his
chief, or even to volunteer them? Alas for
the parish where there is a "Curate's party,"
small or more extensive. Happy the parish
where no chance is given in that direction
by either Incumbent or Curate. Happy
the Curate who is so truly loyal and dutiful,
it may be even under difficulties, that he
makes it quite unmistakable that, if a party
is to gather, it must gather around some one
else.

HOW TO REPRESS IT.

Some cases happily in point are present to
my own mind. I once knew of a parish in[Pg&nbsp;136]
which the truly devoted Vicar was, however,
not popular; he had sadly felt the weight of
depression and disappointment, and this had
had a weakening reflex influence on his ministry.
He was joined by a Curate, a man in the prime
of youth and vigour, well qualified to attract
confidence and affection, and particularly gifted
as a preacher. Very soon many parishioners
showed a preference for the young man's
ministrations in public, and for his company in
private; it was a golden opportunity for the
almost spontaneous formation of a Curate's
party. By the grace of God, the young Clergyman
was enabled both to see the position at
once and, by most decisive and manly speech
and act, in the right quarters, to show, without
a chance of mistake, that he considered his
work as altogether identical with his Vicar's,
never to be carried on for an hour outside a
faithful subordination. Another instance may
be given. Some years ago it was my duty to
explain at a meeting the objects and work of
the Divinity Hall with which I am connected.
Quite incidentally, while describing our course
of teaching, I mentioned my earnest desire[Pg&nbsp;137]
always to caution my student-friends against
giving the slightest encouragement to the rise
of Curates' parties.

*AN EXAMPLE.

At the close of the occasion,
a Clergyman rose at the back of the
parish-room where we met, and said a few
words, as gladdening as they were unexpected.
He had come to the meeting-place with no
knowledge of the meeting; merely to keep
an appointment. But he happened to be the
Vicar of a large town parish, and there to
have had a friend of mine as his Curate;
and he told us how this same Curate had
come to him at a time when the parish, under
circumstances inherited from past years, was
ripe and ready for partizanship and division.
Nothing would have been needed but the
Curate's passive allowance of such tendencies
to embarrass and spoil the difficult work of
the Vicar. But my dear young friend was
"found in Christ"; he knew his Lord's will
in the matter, and he strove to do it. By
active discouragement he precluded the mischief
completely, and thus greatly strengthened
his leader's hands for the work of God before
him.[Pg&nbsp;138]

"THE LOST GRACE, HUMILITY."

Surely few Christian men have wider and
nobler opportunity than Curates have for the
practice of "that lost grace, humility," in its
form of unselfish dutifulness, "good
fidelity in all things." [Tit. ii. 10.] My Brethren know the
sort of humility I mean; no artificial mannerism,
nothing in the least degree unworthy of
the "adult in Christ." What I do mean is
that thing so scarce in our days, the noble
opposite to that individualistic spirit than which
nothing is more narrow, more low, more hostile
to all true, genial development and greatness.
I mean the generous modesty which delights to
recognize the claims of an elder, of a leader;
which loves the idea of trustworthy service,
taking as its motto a more than princely Ich
Dien. I mean the temper of mind which sees
the happiness of siding against ourselves, of
judging not others but ourselves; the spirit
which is much more anxious to vindicate a
superior's reputation than our own, more alert
to ward criticism off from him than to shield
our own head from its arrow. I mean the life
which shows that so far from being ashamed
of the idea of subjection, the man has learnt at[Pg&nbsp;139]
the feet of Jesus to think true service the truest
freedom.

Another day, very probably, the Curate
will find himself an Incumbent, and will have
his own helping brother at his side. It will be
a happy thing then for both parties if he has
thoroughly learnt that great qualification for
command, the experience of obedience; and
has cultivated the exercise of sympathy with
his subordinate by having first striven in
honest loyalty to take his chief's part against
himself.

TAKE PART AGAINST YOURSELF.

Few, very few, are the cases where a man
who has accepted a Curacy with his eyes
reasonably open finds that such is the friction
of the position that his first duty is to seek
a release. There are such cases, I am afraid.
But, I say it again, they are very few; and
in every case which looks as if it were one
of them, the Curate should first exercise the
severest scrutiny upon himself, trying honestly
to find, in some magnifying mirror, "the beam
in his own eye." [Matt. vii. 3.] And even where
such scrutiny still leaves it plain, after consultation
not only with sensible friends (if[Pg&nbsp;140]
necessary) but of course with the Lord Himself,
that it is best to seek a change, let
it be remembered that, up to the very last
day of connexion, the Curate is still the
Curate, bound to all possible loyalty and good
faith.

"SUFFER THE WORD."

It is with some misgivings of feeling that
I have dwelt thus at length on difficulties and
anxieties incident to the relationship of Curate
and Incumbent. But I do not think after all
that I shall be misunderstood. In the nature
of the case, the bright sides of the matter
have hardly needed comment. The Curate
who finds himself the favoured and advantaged
helper of some true-hearted leader needs little
counsel from me, unless it be in face of the
fact, on which we have touched, that the noblest
leaders in the Lord in the whole English
Church are not above parochial criticism, or
even parochial slander. But I do know that
there are Curates whose circumstances are less
favourable; and I long to impress it upon
them that few Christians have a larger and
more fruitful field than they for the cultivation
of some of the crowning graces of the Gospel.[Pg&nbsp;141]
It is for them to make no common proof of
the power of the Indwelling Lord to subdue
the iniquities of His people, to hallow their
inmost spirits, to set before their lips the watch
and ward of His blessed Presence, to drive
utterly away from their pastoral souls the
wretched spirit of sarcasm, to enable them
for an unselfish faithfulness when no eye but
the unseen Master's oversees.

INDEPENDENCE AND LOYALTY.

It is no part of the system of the Church
of England, as it is of that of the Church of
Rome, to put a man (or a woman) under the
"spiritual direction" of a fellow-sinner, who
is to be, for the "directed," the organ and
representative of the will of God. For such
a method is no part of the apostolic Gospel,
which never for a moment bids us surrender
conscience into the keeping of another. "Who
art thou that judgest Another's servant?
To his own Master he standeth or
falleth" [Rom. xiv. 4.]; words which deeply and decisively
contradict the root-ideas of spiritual despotism,
for they teach us to think of our fellow-Christians,
as if&mdash;for purposes of the conscience&mdash;He
who is their Master and ours was, for them,[Pg&nbsp;142]
another Master than ours.[14] Yet the ideas of
spiritual despotism are only the distortion or
parody of ideas which are as true and sacred as
the Gospel can make them; the ideas of self-abnegation
for the good of others, and of
resolute denial of the miserable spirit which
prefers self to others and talks about rights
when we should be intent on duties. The
Christian man, and &agrave; fortiori the Minister
of Christ, is called (as we have seen in earlier
pages) to nothing less than a life in which,
while conscience is inviolable, self is surrendered
to Christ, in that practical sense of the words
which means surrender, for His sake, to others,
in all things which concern not right and wrong
but our self-will.

[14] I owe this remark to my friend the Rev. H.E. Brooke.

"CLOTHED WITH HUMILITY."

"Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves
unto the elder." [Rom. xiv. 4.] I never forget how
the Apostle finishes the passage; "Yea, all of
you, be subject one to another, and be clothed
with humility," &#7952;&#947;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#946;&#8061;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#952;&#949; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#964;&#945;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#966;&#959;&#963;&#8059;&#957;&#951;&#957;,
"tie humility round you" as the servant
ties on his apron. Most characteristic of the[Pg&nbsp;143]
Bible is the impartiality of the precept, so given;
the Elders in the Church of God will not forget
it on their side. But nevertheless the stress of
the precept bears upon the younger man. He,
in the Lord's order, is especially to recollect
the sacred duty of a willing, loyal, and open-eyed
humility.

A NOBLE SUBORDINATION.

All the instincts of our time are against this.
But for the true disciple of Jesus Christ there
is something stronger than any spirit of the
age; it is the Spirit of God, dwelling in the
inmost soul. By that wonderful power the
Christian Curate, who walks with the Lord in
secret, and finds in Him his way of purity and
consistency in the more general aspects of his
"walk with others," will daily be enabled for
a bright and glad consistency in the path of
ministerial subordination. He will not cease
to be a man, who must observe and think; nor
will he necessarily hold it his duty never, in all
loyalty and respect, to express to his Vicar a
differing wish or opinion. But his bias will be
against himself, and for his chief, if he indeed
lets the Spirit of God lead him, and rule him,
and fill him. For the Lord's sake, &#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#922;&#8059;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;,[Pg&nbsp;144]
and by the Lord's power, &#948;&#953;&#8048; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#922;&#965;&#961;&#8055;&#959;&#965;, he will
carry the principle of a watchful
"submission" not only into greater things, but
even into the smaller preferences of his elder
and leader, if they in the least degree affect the
duties of the parish and the church.

A LETTER ON CURATES' GRIEVANCES.

I close this chapter with a quotation. It
is a letter written to the Editor of the
Record, in the spring of 1885, after the perusal
of a correspondence in that paper in which
some "grievances of Evangelical Curates"
had been set forth, and in which it had been
implied that such grievances might give some
sufferers occasion to transfer their sympathies
to another "school."

"After reading the recent correspondence, I
cannot forbear a few words expressive of the
sad impression left upon my mind. Far be it
from me to say that Incumbents have no lessons
to learn from this correspondence. All Incumbents
who have, by grace, 'the mind that was
in Christ Jesus' will surely embrace every suggestion,
however painful in form, which can
stimulate them to larger manifestations of holy
and self-forgetting sympathy, perfectly com[Pg&nbsp;145]patible
with the firm attitude (which is also
their duty) of responsible direction. But this
thought leaves unaltered the mournful impression
taken from the tone of the letters of my
aggrieved Brethren. In one form or another
one thought seemed to breathe in all;&mdash;the
thought of my rights, my position, my gifts and
opportunities, and what was due from others in
regard of them; the complaint that others were
not humble, when the Christian's first concern
with humility is to derive it for himself from
his Lord. Such a spirit is not easily compatible
with a true secret hourly walk with God and
abiding in Christ, the sine qu&acirc; non of fruit-bearing.
And fruit-bearing is the supreme
inner aim of the true pastoral life, fruit-bearing
in the devoted doing of the Master's present
will.

"In one letter I read with pain that 'it is no
marvel' if men who cannot secure justice and
happiness in one party should transfer their
allegiance to another. Is it indeed 'no marvel'?
Is it to be expected, then, in the holy Ministry,
that convictions about divine truth should be
modified by the personal claims and comfort of[Pg&nbsp;146]
the holder, if the word 'hold' may be used
without severe irony in such a connexion?
Can a saint and servant of God, young or old,
Vicar or Curate, walk closely with Him all day,
truly given to Him, wholly submissive to His
word and will, and yet find it possible to deal
with convictions so? What are personal rights
and exterior happiness weighed against the
claims of what we have really grasped as truth
in the presence of the Lord? It is well for us
that martyrs and confessors, and their worthy
successors, our Evangelical ancestors of a
century ago, knew how to answer that question.

CONVICTION SACRED, SELF NOWHERE.

"I aim to speak with all humility and
sympathy. But I cannot but thus earnestly
express the unalterable conviction that the only
ministerial life which can be 'sanctified and
meet for the Master's use' is the life in which
conviction is sacred, in which Christ is all, and
in which self is nowhere."




[Pg&nbsp;147]
CHAPTER VII.CONTENTS

PASTOR IN PARISH (i.).

[Pg&nbsp;148]

Master, to the flock I speed,
In Thy presence, in Thy name;
Show me how to guide, to feed,
How aright to cheer and blame;
With me knock at every door;
Enter with me, I implore.

[Pg&nbsp;149]

We have talked together about the young
Clergyman's secret life, and private life,
and his life in (so to speak) non-clerical intercourse
with others, and now lastly of his life
as it stands related to his immediate leader
in the Ministry. In this latter topic we have
already touched the great matter which comes
now at once before us, the man's work amongst
his neighbours as he approaches them in his
proper character, as a Pastor.

"THE PULSE OF THE MACHINE."

How shall I speak of "parish-work"? It
would be a boundless subject if treated in
detail and in the style of a directory of
methods. But such a treatment is far from
my purpose. To undertake it, I should not
only need to be a widely experienced Pastor,
which I cannot claim to be, for my life for[Pg&nbsp;150]
many years has been mainly devoted to
academic teaching; I should need to be several
widely experienced Pastors bound up into one
living volume. So let no one expect to find
here a prescription for the right plans and
right practice of the many departments of the
rural pastorate, or of the urban, or suburban;
directions how to organize work, and how to
develop it; how to deal with the Sunday
School, or the Day School, or the Institute,
or the Guild, or the Visitors' Meeting, or the
Missionary Association. My hope is rather
to get behind all these things to the pulse
of the busy machinery; to offer a few hints
to my younger Brethren "how to do it," from
the point of view of their personal and inner
preparedness for the multifold work, and to
state some plain general principles which may
run through all the doing.

VISITING.

I set before me then the Curate, and the
Parish, with its demands for pastoral labour,
and particularly for Visitation. Well do I
know how immense the differences are between
place and place in this same matter of visitation;
how the parish of a few hundreds, or[Pg&nbsp;151]
even of two or three thousand, is one thing,
and the parish of ten, or eighteen, or twenty
thousand is another. I know that there are
parishes, in London for example, where all
the efforts of a staff of devoted Clergy seem
to fail to do more than touch the edges of the
work of domestic visitation. Yet surely even
in such cases that work must not, and will
not, be quite given up as hopeless. A little,
where only a little is possible, is vastly better
than none; even if it be only the visitation
of the sick, and of those who immediately
surround them, and with whom the sick-visit
gives the Clergyman an opportunity. Such
efforts, where nothing more of the kind is
possible, if only done in an unmistakable spirit
of love and self-sacrifice, must carry good to
the people. And do not forget that they must,
quite as necessarily, carry good to the Clergyman.
For they are a means, for which nothing
else can be quite the substitute, of bringing
him into contact with the people's thoughts
and lives in ways which will tell usefully (as
we have seen in an earlier page) upon his
whole ministry, particularly upon his work in[Pg&nbsp;152]
the pulpit, and at the mission-room desk, and
in the open air.

But, to be as practical as possible, I will
assume that the Curacy is of a more normal
kind than that just supposed. The parish,
whether in country or in town, is not so large
as to make visitation from house to house impossible.
And the Curate has had his work
of this kind assigned him, and is setting out
upon it. A good portion of every day (though
I hope it is possible to give a part of one day
each week to some sort of wisely managed
holiday) is devoted to "the district"; now for
a steady round of calls, door by door; now,
in an irregularity not without method, for
visits to special cases of sickness, or sorrow,
or other need.

PREPARE FOR VISITATION WITH PRAYER.

What shall be my first suggestion? It shall
point to the Throne of Grace. Preface the
pastoral round with special secret prayer.
Sermons are usually (I wish it were always so
now) prefaced with prayer in the pulpit that
the heavenly blessing may rest upon the
ordinance. Is it less fitting, less necessary,
to prepare for the afternoon's or evening's[Pg&nbsp;153]
visitation with a secret petition in your own
room that the apostolic ordinance of
domestic visitation [Acts xx. 20, 21.], to be administered now by
you, may have the special grace of God in
it? Pray for yourself, my younger Brother.

*PRAY FOR SPIRITUAL READINESS AND SPIRITUAL FULNESS.

Ask that you may go out well furnished with
the peace, and patience, and wisdom laid up
for you in your Lord; that you may have "by
the Holy Spirit a right judgment in all things";
that you may have "the tongue of the taught,[15]
to speak a word in season to them that are
weary"; whatever sort of weariness it is.
Pray for that secret skill of discernment which
can see the difference of spiritual states, and[Pg&nbsp;154]
allot warning or comfort not at random but "in
due season." Pray for that readiness for the
unexpected which is best secured and best
maintained in a close and conscious intimacy
with your Saviour. The man "found in Him"
will be found ready in spirit (and that is after
all the essential in spiritual work) for the
sudden question, whether anxious or captious,
for the sudden rudeness of ignorance or opposition,
and again for the chronic and so to speak
passive difficulty of indifference. "The tongue
of the taught," while the "taught" man is found
in Christ, will ever be sweet, wise, and truthful,
as the owner of it goes his round. But
we must seek for it; "He will be
enquired of for this thing." [Ezek. xxxvi. 37.]

[15] Isai. l. 4. Obviously the word "learned" in our Version is
there used in its old English sense, "instructed, taught." No
slight on "book-learning" is ever conveyed in the Scriptures.
But the man in view here is not the highly-educated person,
but the believer who has listened with the ear "of the taught"
(see the end of the verse), as a disciple at the Master's feet; and
so goes forth to speak with "the tongue of the taught," as a
messenger who has learned sympathy, insight, holy tact and
truthfulness, from the Master's heart. The whole passage is
full of the blessed Messiah Himself, I know. But it has its
reflected reference for all His true followers, and above all for
all His true Ministers. May He give us, in His mercy, for every
act of our messenger-work, both the ear and the tongue of His
"taught" ones.

Then, as you pray for yourself, you will pray
also for the people you are about to visit.
Perhaps they are as yet strange to you, and
you can ask for them only in general. But if
you know anything at all about them it will
be worth while to individualize your prayer,
however briefly. Special, detailed prayer is a
power with God. And it is a power with man
too. To be dealing with one for whom you[Pg&nbsp;155]
know you have prayed is already to have a
foothold there. Perhaps you may have an
opportunity to say, quite naturally, that you
have been praying for him; and this may very
possibly be a direct vehicle of blessing.

You will go out then, as directly as possible,
from the secret place of heavenly intercourse.
That is a bracing atmosphere:

"Fresh airs and heavenly odours breathe around
The throne of grace;"

and those airs can quicken the young Pastor's
spirit for the heaviest hours of a sultry afternoon
or evening, till he comes back weary to his
rooms, "tired in the Lord's work, but not tired
of it," as dying Whitefield said.

So you go forth with real prayer. It is
your wonderful privilege, thus going to carry
nothing less than the blessed "Fulness of the
Holy Ghost" for your inmost equipment. I
say deliberately, nothing less than the heavenly
Fulness&mdash;a far different thing from a mere
stir and lift of the emotions. That most divine
gift is a "calm excess" of tranquil power,
received humbly by the prayer of faith. It[Pg&nbsp;156]
is not meant to be a rare luxury; it is a daily
and hourly offer, a provided viaticum for every
stage of walk and duty. Can we work aright
for God while any corner of our being has no
room for God, and is not possessed by Him?

METHOD.

Then, for true prayer and true practicality
are the closest and most harmonious friends,
you will of course aim with forethought and
persistency at method in the pastoral work.
The visits will be arranged as far as possible
with economy of space; no difficult task in
most town parishes, while in the country, of
course, the matter is often much less easy.
And you will study also economy of time.
Your round is a work of sacred business. The
minutes, the quarters of an hour, are never to
run loose and unobserved. Who that has ever
visited in a parish does not know the need of
remembering that point, so easily forgotten?
Here we visit a pleasant, welcoming neighbour,
and it is all too easy to stay on, perhaps to
little real purpose, with the secret satisfaction
of knowing that the next and much less attractive
call must be shortened in proportion.
Here, less willingly, we are detained by one[Pg&nbsp;157]
of those ingenious tongues which make it so
difficult to get in a word, or to stop the unprofitable
continuity of topics. All these cases,
and endless kindred ones, need a little foresight
and firmness, and a little of the skill which is
soon learnt by open heart and open eyes.

ECONOMY OF TIME.

Obviously this line of caution is more needed
by some men than by others. But it is needed
by not a few; particularly in respect of the
temptation to lengthen out unduly the visits
that are pleasant to the visitor. One young
Clergyman known to me, an indefatigable and
devoted visitor, needed a strong reminder in
this direction in the early days of his ministry.
He would visit a sick person, who proved more
or less responsive to his efforts, and would
allow himself to over-visit, to an unwise extent,
going often more than once a day, and long
after the state of the invalid made such attentions
urgent. And other work of course
suffered in proportion. Wesley's precept to
his workers needs our remembrance often;
"Go not where you are wanted, but where you
are wanted most."

BUT AVOID HURRY.

But a risk on the other hand must be re[Pg&nbsp;158]membered.
Economy of time must never
mean hurry of manner, a thing which is nearly
if not quite fatal to the usefulness of a visit.
It is perfectly possible to combine promptitude
with quiet; to come manifestly on business,
and yet not in a bustle. We Clergymen may
learn many valuable lessons in this, as in some
other parts of our work, from our medical
friends. Observe how a wise and kindly doctor
visits his parishioners. He knows exactly why
he comes; he knows that other patients are
wanting him, in long succession; he knows
that he must observe and advise as promptly
and as much to the point as possible; and he
knows that all must be done with a quiet,
strong, untroubled manner, if it is to be done
aright.

I spoke in a previous chapter about the
sacred duty of watching and regulating manner.
This is to be done at all times of intercourse,
but above all in pastoral visits. To speak
only of this point of hurry or calm of manner;
it is most important. The right manner will
make a visit of five minutes practically longer
than a twenty minutes' visit which gives all[Pg&nbsp;159]
through it the impression that the Clergyman
must be off. One of the most admirable
Pastors I have ever known, the late Rev.
Charles Clayton, of Cambridge,[16] did much
of his work by five-minute visits. But they
were always visits in which the whole thought
was given to the case before him, and the
word in season came from full knowledge of
his flock and from an unmistakably pastoral
heart.

[16] Afterwards Rector of Stanhope and Canon of Ripon.

IMPARTIAL COURTESY.

A duty which you will carefully remember
throughout your round is that of quiet Christian
courtesy; impartially shown to rich, to
middling, and to poor. I say impartially, with
a view to both ends of the scale. Some men
(perhaps not many, but some) seem to think
that ministerial courage and fidelity in dealing
with well-to-do parishioners demand a certain
dropping of the courtesies of life; a very great
mistake. Many more men are tempted to
forget that their visits to the poorest should
be, in the essence of the matter, as courteous
as when they go to the portal which carries[Pg&nbsp;160]
a brass knocker. At the door of the dingiest
cottage, or dingier lodging, never forget that
you ask for entrance; it is your neighbour's
castle-door; and you are not a sanitary inspector.
If you happen to come in at the
meal-time of the roughest and dirtiest, apologize
as naturally and honestly as you would
if you intruded on the wealthy churchwarden's
well-set luncheon. Among the very lowest,
do all you can to honour parents before their
children (I know it is nearly impossible in
some sad cases); and always honour old age.

BE NATURAL.

Surely one good maxim on manner with
our poorer neighbours is to aim to address
them very much as we would address our
neighbours of our own class. A patronizing
manner is most certainly a very great pity,
and almost sure to be resented. But so, too,
is the ostentatious "hail-and-well-met" manner
which is sometimes assumed; an over-drawn
imitation, perhaps, of the workman's manner
with his fellows. This is a mistake, because it
is almost always unnatural. Few gentlemen
get better at others by ceasing to act and
speak as gentlemen. Let us talk quite quietly[Pg&nbsp;161]
and pleasantly, as just what we are, and as
those who most unaffectedly "honour
all men," [1 Pet. ii. 17.] and we shall not go far astray;
always supposing that the matter of our talk
is sensible, true, and to the purpose.

THE SICK-ROOM.

To turn aside for a moment to the special
and sacred work of Visitation of the Sick. It
is not to be lightly done, as if it were an easy
part of our duty, quite obvious in its aims and
methods. The greatest judgment is often
needed in the sick-room. We need quickness
to perceive how much conversation the
invalid can bear, if the case is one of great
pain, or (what often makes undue length even
more irksome) great weakness. We need
an insight into the best side of approach
to conscience, or to will. We need the skill
which knows how to question enough, but
not too much, not as the inquisitor but as the
helper. Many another matter will call for
sanctified common-sense in the sick-room; a
restful voice, easy, quiet movements, and the
like. And let me say that where you are
visiting a chronic case, and need to call again
and again, if a day and hour for the next[Pg&nbsp;162]
visit is mentioned it should be kept to with
jealous punctuality. Nothing is more trying
to the suffering and weary than uncertainty
and suspense. I have known of much harm
done to good men's influence by their neglect
of punctuality with sick people.

PUNCTUALITY.

Of punctuality generally I can (and surely
need) speak only in passing. It is a primary
duty of the busy but patient work of the
pastorate. To be neglectful of it is to set
up and keep up a needless and mischievous
friction in our intercourse with others, and
indefinitely to injure our influence in many
ways. "No man ever waited five minutes
for me in my life, unless for reasons quite
beyond my power;" such was a remark of
Charles Simeon's in his last days. We may
be for ever unable to say this of our own past.
But if so, shall it not be true for us also from
this day forward?

USE OF THE BIBLE IN VISITING.

Thus prepared by secret and special intercourse
with God, and recollecting some simple
maxims about practical points, you go out into
the parish. But no; let me suggest one other
preliminary, which, before most rounds of[Pg&nbsp;163]
pastoral visiting, cannot be out of place. You
will take in your pocket two books, if not more;
one, your visiting register and diary, the other&mdash;your
Bible. Of the use to be made of the
note-book I need not speak. About that to be
made of the Book of God let me say a very
few words.

I do not mean at all that you will make
the reading of the Holy Scriptures a matter of
form or routine; a thing which must be done,
as an opus operandum, wherever there is a
chance. But I do mean that you should have
the Book always ready for use, and be prompt
to sow the "incorruptible seed" [1 Pet. i. 23.] from
house to house as God gives opportunity.
Remember, it is a Book sadly little known by
the very large majority of your people; so that
every natural and naturally-taken occasion to
"let it speak," in private as well as in public,
is a contribution to that urgent need of our
modern world, Bible-knowledge. Remember
again that, despite all the wretched unsettlements
of belief amongst us, the Bible is still
the Bible, for untold multitudes; it is owned by
them, whether or no it is used, as the Oracle[Pg&nbsp;164]
of God. Let us let the Book speak at the
open ear of such a conviction, however dimly
the conviction is entertained. And then remember
that the Bible, whatever be the state
of current opinion about it, is as a fact the
Oracle of God, and its immortal and life-conveying
words have a mysterious fitness all
their own to be the vehicle of the Spirit's voice
to the human heart. Offer it, as often as you
can, to be that vehicle.

CHOOSE A PASSAGE BEFOREHAND.

Two simple expedients for effective use of
the Scriptures in a parish round are presented
to me by my own past experience, gathered
from several years of regular parochial work.
One is, the choice of some short pregnant
passage which shall be, for that round, the
passage to be read not once only but in house
after house, unless, of course, there is special
reason to the contrary. Such a reiteration,
so I have often found, is a great help to the
visitor, who probably feels on each new occasion
that a new power and point appear in the
passage, and that it seems each time easier
to speak from it, however briefly, to the soul.
The other expedient which my experience[Pg&nbsp;165]
recommends is to be prepared, whenever a
hopeful opportunity occurs, to leave a Scripture
message visibly behind you as you go. I used
to carry with me a little sheaf of slips of paper,
on each of which was printed the request,
Please read this passage, and think about it. A
short message from the heavenly Word would
be written on the slip in pencil as I was about
to go; and this visible and personal invitation
to "read and think" proved often a real remembrance
from the Lord.

THE VISITING PASTOR AT WORK.

But now you are actively engaged from door
to door. If you are a new-comer, and particularly
if it is also a district (in the great City
perhaps) where visitation has been an unwonted
thing, you must be prepared of course for very
various sorts of reception. But assuredly in
most districts by far, and at most doors, the
man who exercises common tact and courtesy,
and is plainly trying to do his duty in a loving
and earnest spirit, and is known already, or
now introduces himself, as the Clergyman, will
be civilly and often gladly met.

*OUR ADVANTAGE AS MINISTERS OF THE ENGLISH CHURCH.

Let me pause for a moment to remind you of one great
and valuable advantage which is ours as the[Pg&nbsp;166]
Ministers of the National Church and the
servants of the parochial system. All honour
to devoted servants of God in the Ministry of
other denominations; in numberless instances
they have done in the past, and are doing now,
work which the National Church has either
neglected, or has been unable to overtake; and
the power of the Lord has been and is present
with them to bless. But nevertheless I for one
thank God for a National Church, and recognize
in that Church's historical and practical
position a unique opportunity and an immense
advantage, so it be used faithfully and in
loyalty to the Lord and His Word. And one
feature of that position of opportunity is this,
that it is the popularly (and rightly) recognized
duty of the Church of England Clergyman to
ask admission at every door, so far as he can
go to every door, within his portion of the
national vineyard. To a large degree this is
understood to be our duty, our business, as it
is not understood to be that of other Ministers
of religion; and this is a fact which for the man
who will use it with good sense and unobtrusive
diligence is an invaluable introduction. A[Pg&nbsp;167]
"younger Brother" of my own, whose work
began in a Liverpool Curacy, told me of his
experience in this matter. His district contained
a very miscellaneous population; almost
all the great dissenting Churches were represented,
and there were many Roman Catholics,
and not a few Jews. But the Curate went to
every door, as in duty bound; as a friend, a
neighbour, a Christian, but distinctly as one of
the Clergy of the parish. And with one solitary
exception, an instance in which a Jew repulsed
him, he was not only admitted but welcomed
everywhere in his character as the Clergyman.

Of course there are, as I have said just
above, streets and lanes where it is not quite
so. Another friend of mine, labouring in East
London, found that his black coat and white
tie suggested to some of the people only the
guess that he was&mdash;the undertaker; so strange
to them was the presence of a Clergyman, or
the idea of his duty. The same friend, by the
way, found that there was one sure prescription
for securing a welcome on a second visit&mdash;to
make the people laugh before the first visit
was over. He was no careless Pastor, who[Pg&nbsp;168]
forgot that he was in quest of souls, and that
the message of the Lord is no jest. But his
experience was that in that strange "lapsed"
population the rapport between man and man
set up by an honest laugh was important as the
first step to something very different which was
to follow.

COME TO THE POINT.

In the ordinary pastoral round no such ingenious
merriment will be necessary; though
you will of course aim not only to be but to be
seen to be happy in your work, and in your
Master; bright with a light which is as natural
in its influence as it is divine in its origin. In
the ordinary round one great principle to be
remembered, if I am right, is that you should
come to the point as soon as possible. Some
earnest men greatly shrink from this, and aim
at the souls of their people by very circuitous
routes. As a rule, I am sure, there is little
need to do so; we are "expected" to be about
our Master's business, and to deliver His
messages without needless delay. I would not
counsel the general verbal adoption of one
good country Parson's salutation, who always
opened the cottage door with, "How are you?[Pg&nbsp;169]
How is your soul?" But I have no doubt it
was a good greeting for many a parishioner
of his; and the principle of it is good for
almost every pastoral visit. Yes, we shall do
well to take people very much for granted,
coming before them as we do (unless we quite
forget our true character) as the Lord Jesus
Christ's messengers and delegates, whatever
else we are.

KEEP IT ALWAYS IN VIEW.

Most certainly and obviously the Pastor will
often allude to common human interests, and
should indeed know something and have something
to say and do about temporal problems,
things of body and estate. But then I do
hold that he should "draw all things this"
supremely important "way." All his pastoral
intercourse should bear somehow upon the
question of the state before God of the person
or persons visited; upon conviction of sin, or
comfort in grace, or Christian conduct; upon
Christ and the soul, upon holiness
and immortality, as the Gospel "brings them
out into the light." [2 Tim. i. 10.]

A DIFFICULT CASE WELL MET.

There are cases most certainly where this
has to be done with peculiar tact and caution[Pg&nbsp;170]
unless quite obvious mischief is to be done
instead of good. But let the man be always
lying in wait, and he will very seldom do so
quite in vain. An instance occurs to me, in
the work of a most honoured veteran in the
Ministry. He called on a new parishioner,
a lady of his own class, and soon found out
that she was politely but resolutely arranging
to keep Jesus Christ out of the conversation;
so cleverly that he fairly failed to break the
fence. Just as he was leaving, for he could
not go without one mention of his Master,
he said, as the last word of his courteous farewell,
"The Lord bless you." That was all;
but it was enough to carry in it the Spirit's
message. The utterance stayed in the parishioner's
soul, sounding solemnly on. It was
impossible to be offended; it was impossible
not to think. And the issue was, in God's
time, a real and deep conversion.

A HAPPY REBUKE TO COWARDICE.

But, I repeat it, such difficulties in "the
daily round" need not be very frequent, if we
do not create them for ourselves. How often
the very persons to whom we think it wiser
not to speak openly about the Lord Jesus Christ[Pg&nbsp;171]
(remember, it is about Him, even more than
about themselves, we are to speak) are longing
to hear us do so! In the early days of my
ordination I remember visiting an invalid
gentleman, who had known me (for it was my
Father's parish) all my life; and I was very
cowardly in his case about coming to the point
of Christ and the soul. Several visits, let me
confess it with shame, were paid before I found
myself able to propose that we should open
the Bible together, and then pray. I was
moved to the inmost heart by the actual
tears of delight with which the proposal was
welcomed.

And not seldom, if we do not come to the
point, our people will bring us to it. A very
dear friend of mine, a few years ago, was
going his first circuits in a large London parish,
and paid one among many first visits. He
allowed it to be a mere visit of introductory
civilities; but he need not have been so
cautious. As he rose to go the good woman
on whom he had called said to him, "You
will have a word of prayer with me, will you
not? The Vicar always does."



"Go, labour on, spend and be spent;
Thy joy to do the Father's will;
It is the way the Master went;
Should not the servant tread it still?

"Go, labour on while it is day,
The world's dark night is hastening on;
Speed, speed thy work, cast sloth away;
It is not thus that souls are won."

Bonar.



[Pg&nbsp;173]
CHAPTER VIII.CONTENTS

PASTOR IN PARISH (ii.).

[Pg&nbsp;174]

Work on in hope; the plough, the sickle wield;
Thy Master is the harvest's Master too;
He gives the golden seed, He owns the field,
And does Himself what His true servants do.

[Pg&nbsp;175]

I take up again the all-important subject
of Pastoral Visitation, for the same sort
of informal and fragmentary treatment as that
attempted in the last chapter, and with the
same feeling that the subject is practically
inexhaustible.

LET THE VISITOR BE A TEACHER, WATCHING FOR OPPORTUNITIES.

One object which the visitor will do well to
keep steadily before him is, to be a teacher as
he goes. I have said something of this already,
in recommending my Brethren to seize every
good occasion for bringing in the Bible, and
words about the Bible. But the whole work of
instruction needs remembrance in our private
intercourse with parishioners. Of course we
shall avoid with watchful and willing care the
magisterial manner, the too didactic tone. And
only when obvious occasions present themselves[Pg&nbsp;176]
shall we even seem to set ourselves to teach;
as when we are distinctly asked what is the
meaning of this doctrine, or that passage of
Scripture, or that phrase of the Prayer Book,
or how to meet that difficulty of belief. Such
moments do come; in some pastoral lives they
come frequently; and whether the inquiry is
made in a friendly spirit, with a real wish for
information, or whether, as sometimes, it is the
question of a critic or a caviller, it is an opportunity
for which, in the Lord's grace, we should
stand quite ready. To be sure we may have
sometimes to remember that sensible precept
of the Rabbis, "Teach thy tongue to say, I do
not know"; the answer, often, of the truest
and deepest-sighted wisdom. But even when
answering so, instruction may be given, as we
state the reasons for the answer. And we
shall at least have the opportunity while so
doing to bring in that other maxim, which we
owe, I think, to the late Archbishop Whately,
"Never allow what you do know to be disturbed
by what you do not know"; a principle of very
wide application.

But I am thinking now rather of the every[Pg&nbsp;177]-day
sort of pastoral call and conversation, in
which perhaps the parishioner visited may be
anything but a caviller, and anything but even
a questioner; much too ready, perhaps, to
take everything about Christian truths for
granted, which, alas, means too often to take
them as understood, to take them as believed,
when there is little understanding of the matter,
or even thought about it. Now it is a great
thing when a pastoral visitor has the art
(which needs to be considered, and to be
acquired) of putting here and there into a
quiet and friendly talk, best of all towards the
close, some sentence which sets out a great
truth clearly, strongly, and in a shape which
may wake attention and help remembrance.
That is the kind of didactic work which I
earnestly recommend.

*THE PASTORAL TEACHER'S TOPICS.

If possible, let no visit
close without some such utterance, if only one.
It may be about the very foundations of all
Christian truth; about the certainty of Christian
facts, the Resurrection above all; about
the Person of the Lord Jesus; about His
finished work of Atonement; about faith, and
our acceptance as believers in Him, and our[Pg&nbsp;178]
victory and deliverance in temptation by the
power of the Holy Ghost through faith;
about sin, its true nature, its guilt, its end.
Or it may be about the holy practicalities
of Christian conduct; about the Lord's call
to us to break with everything that is
against His will; about that deep, far-reaching
truth of the Gospel that, while the sinner is
saved by faith only, he is saved on purpose
that he may serve, on purpose that he may
walk and please God," [1 Thess. iv. 1.] and that
he may do this above all in "the duty that
lies near," in the plain things of the home, the
business, the handicraft, the social circle. Or
it may be about the mighty claims of the
Missionary cause, about the strangely forgotten
fact that the Christian Church exists
mainly in order to evangelize the non-Christian
world. Or it may be about the principles
and duties of Church membership and Christian
ordinances; the true nature of worship;
the sacred duty of united worship; the call
to hallow the Lord's Day; the precious benefits
of the Sacraments of Christ, explained
with the holy reverence and equally holy sim[Pg&nbsp;179]plicity
and moderation of the Catechism and
the Articles.

NEED FOR SUCH WORK.

I need not fill my pages with numberless
details. For my plea is that we should rather
hold ourselves ready for the natural rise of
such or such topics, and for a clear instructive
word in season upon them, than that we should
propose a theme and deliver a discourse. But
I cannot too earnestly remind my Brethren
how great the need of instruction is among
many of our kindly neighbours, even among
our neighbours who go regularly to Church
and are constantly to be seen at the Table
of the Lord.

CHRIST "A BLESSED ANGEL."

Let me take one pre-eminent subject as my
illustration: the foundation-truth of the Godhead
of our Blessed Redeemer. Are you at
all aware how widely spread is ignorance and
error on that subject, far beyond the limits of
the "Unitarian"[17] community? I remember
a pastoral visit long ago to a slowly dying[Pg&nbsp;180]
parishioner, a labouring man somewhat stricken
in years, who had been a church-goer, though
not a communicant. I soon fell into a conversation
with my friend which took a sort
of catechetical shape; my aim was to see
where the soul's hopes for eternity really rested.
Who and What was Jesus, whose name I
know he humbly reverenced? Was He a
good Man? Yes. But anything more? There
was a long hesitation, and then the dear man
expressed a faltering persuasion that the Lord
could not be less than "a blessed angel."
That case, I am well convinced, is very much
more representative than some of us may think.
At a recent Church Congress I heard some
remarks in just this direction from Bishop
Walsham How, who speaks from a large
pastoral experience; his anxiety about the immense
extent of popular ignorance or misbelief
about the Saviour's Person was at least as
great as mine.

[17] A term which I use under protest. If a Unitarian means a
believer in the Unity of the Godhead, every orthodox Christian
is a true Unitarian. Only, he is a Trinitarian also, from another
side. I may venture to refer on this subject to a small book
of my own, Outlines of Christian Doctrine, p. 20.

"ALL MY SUFFERMENT HERE."

And so too is ignorance and misbelief about
the work of His Cross, and of His Holy Spirit.
"I hope I shall have all my sufferment here,"
said one poor invalid to me in old days, speak[Pg&nbsp;181]ing
indeed from a very comfortless bed, in
the slow pains of a dire disease. She had
been long within sound of clear, bright Christian
teaching. But deep in the soul, unmoved
and ah, so difficult to dislodge, lay that notion
of an atoning value in our own pains which is
a radical contradiction to the glorious paradox
of the perfect and unique work of Calvary:&mdash;

"Thy pains, not mine, O Christ,
Upon the shameful tree
Have paid the law's full price,
And purchased peace for me.

"Thy Cross, not mine, O Christ,
Has borne the awful load
Of sins that none in heaven
Or earth could bear but God."[18]

[18] Bonar, Hymns of Faith and Hope (First Series).

THE TRUTH OF THE HOLY SPIRIT.

As regards the Person and the Work of
the blessed Spirit, great and general is the oblivion,
and manifold are the mistakes. I fear
that even in the best instructed congregations,
under the clearest public teaching, there are all
too many who, practically, "have not so much
as heard whether there be any Holy
Ghost." [Acts xix. 2.] The belief in His glorious Personality[Pg&nbsp;182]
is faint and vague. The confusion of His
Presence and Power with our "better feelings"
is very, very common. The solemn questions
which the Scripture bids us put to ourselves, [Rom. viii. 9.]
whether or not we "have the Spirit
of Christ"&mdash;not merely "a Christian spirit" in
the sense of tone and temper, but the Holy
Ghost, proceeding from the Son, and uniting
the true believer to Him&mdash;are little understood,
and rarely used upon the man by himself.
And the very thought of such a presence and
such a power of the Lord the Life-Giver as
shall "fill us with the Spirit" [Eph. v. 18.] is not
yet existent, I fear, in the minds of many even
earnest Christians.

Here are fields, large and fruitful, for the
teaching visitor's cultivation. And so are the
other possible subjects indicated above; such
as the claims of the Lord upon our personal
consistency in little things; His solemn call
to all His people to be, directly or indirectly,
the evangelists of the world; and the nature
of His blessed sacramental Institutions.

THE TRUTH OF THE SACRAMENTS.

On that last subject it is not my intention to
enter at any length. But a few words I may[Pg&nbsp;183]
take this occasion to say, and I will assume
that I am speaking to a younger Brother
who in the main agrees with me in what are
commonly called Evangelical Church principles.
Let me first then counsel you to take care that
no one shall be able, lawfully, to charge you
with making light of the Sacraments,[19] or with
leaving uncertain your belief as to their divine
purpose and function. A ministry which is
silent about them, and indistinct in its teaching
on them, cannot in this respect be fully true
to either the Prayer Book or the Bible. Let
your instructions on this great subject, in public
and in private, be definite, reverent, and full
of thankfulness and praise for those great gifts
of God. Then on the other hand, do not, if I
may speak freely, while with all respect, think
to honour the Sacraments by exaggeration, by
speaking more of them than of that far greater
thing, the blessed Grace of God in Christ, of
which they are the "sure witnesses and effectual[Pg&nbsp;184]
signs."[20] If I do not mistake, one of the most
prevalent tendencies of current thought in the
Church now is the tendency to invert, in a certain
way, the relations between Sacrament and
Grace; to develop a doctrine of the Sacrament
such that the doctrine of Grace can be seen only,
as it were, through it. And the result is, very
often, so at least it seems to me to be, a very
poor and attenuated presentation of the glorious
things said in Scripture about "the grace
of God which bringeth salvation," [Tit. ii. 11.]
and about the work of pure and simple, but
mysteriously mighty, faith in our appropriation
of Christ's merits and our reception of Christ's
living power by the Holy Ghost. Let no such
inversion mark your teaching. And if I may
give one further suggestion, I would say, remind
yourself frequently of the very words of the
Prayer Book (including the Catechism) and the[Pg&nbsp;185]
Articles on these great subjects. And inform
yourself to some extent, at first hand, of the
views of the men who cast our Services and
our Articles into their practically present shape;
the views of Cranmer, of Ridley, of Jewell, and,
just after them, of Hooker; not forgetting one
great foreign theologian, Henry Bullinger, who
exercised a special influence on the English
divines of Edward and Elizabeth's time in the
matter of sacramental doctrine.[21] You will find in
him a full measure of holy reverence, and at the
same time a luminous clearness and definiteness
of exposition. The central idea of his teaching
is the idea of the Covenant Seal, the "instrument"
of solemn, valid, legal "conveyance."

[19] I mean of course Baptism and the Supper of the Lord,
which alone the Church of England recognizes as Christian
Sacraments, Sacramenta Evangelica, "Sacraments of the Gospel"
(see Art. xxv., par. 2).

[20] Certa testimonia, efficacia signa (Art. xxv.). It is worth the
while to point out that a "sign" is "effectual" when it effectually
does the work of a sign, not some quite different work. A seal
is an effectual seal, not because, conceivably, its matter could be
used as a powerful medicine, but because, attached to its document,
it effectually seals the document's validity. A seal is in
this respect a special sort of "effectual sign." And so are the
Sacraments.

[21] See the Parker Society's collection of authors for Bullinger's
Decades, or Doctrinal Sermons; officially recognized as a body of
divinity by the Church of England in Elizabeth's reign.

MISTAKES ABOUT CHURCH DOCTRINE.

While on the subject of Church Doctrine, I
may go a little further, and remind you how
very likely you are to discover in your rounds
many mistakes about both the doctrine and the
government of the Church of England. I have
had considerable experience of such questions
in the way of private pastoral ministry; I have[Pg&nbsp;186]
found pious dissenters, or church-people whom
they had influenced, fully persuaded that the
Church of England teaches unconditional regeneration
in the hour of Baptism, that she
teaches at least a near approach to Transubstantiation,
that she entrusts to her priests the
power of conferring or withholding the divine
forgiveness, and that, officially and in set terms,
she "unchurches" all communities not episcopally
organized.[22] It is well to be quite sure
that these beliefs about the Church are mistakes,
provably such, in the light of the Prayer Book
and Articles, and of history. It has been my
happiness to bring some such questioners as I
have described to "sincere and conscientious
communion with" the Church of England, in
a loyalty which leaves ample room for loving
sympathy with all true Christians. And the
chief means has been the production of proof
that the Church herself, as distinguished from
particular teachers and leaders in the Church,
does not teach the tenets alleged.

[22] As regards the Scottish and Continental Protestant Churches
it is not too much to say that, with the very rarest exceptions,
English Church writers of all schools regarded them as "Sister
Churches of the Reformation"&mdash;till about 1830.[Pg&nbsp;187]

DEFECTIVE VIEWS OF SIN.

But to come back to matters more primary
than even these; I must remind my younger
Brother that there is, all around him, in the
average circles of even church-going people,
a sorrowfully faint insight into the sinfulness of
Sin; into the terrible realities of its guilt before
God (a point too often absent from even
earnest modern teaching), and of its power;
yes, and into its true nature, as it comes out,
not in outbursts of word or deed, or in practices
which public opinion condemns, but in imagination,
in desire, in tone. It may surprise us
(when we think how very elementary are the
spiritual principles involved), but I fear it is a
fact, that sin is regarded by vast numbers of
church-people (I am not thinking at all of "the
lapsed masses" now) as a matter of little importance
if it does not come out in some very
positive form. Multitudes among us are quite
insensible to the spiritual penetration of the law
of God, and have never given a thought to
the question of a heart-surrender to His will in
everything, and the sin of merely withholding
that surrender.

Then, to take another primary subject of a[Pg&nbsp;188]
different class; there is a wide and general
ignorance of the great lines of Christian Evidence,
and a large open door accordingly for
the active attacks of shallow, or subtle, unbelief.
Few have ever been taught in any definite way
the supreme significance in this respect of the
fact of the Lord's Resurrection, and its mighty
walls of proof; and the reasons for our belief
that the Bible is indeed not of man but of
God; the witness of history to prophecy; and
so on.

LET US DROP SEEDS OF TEACHING.

I owe an almost apology for this long talk
about subjects of doctrine, and practice, and
evidence. But I have kept all along the purpose
of this chapter in view. I wish to remind
my Brethren how very much they may do, in
the course of visitation, to drop seeds of fact,
of truth, of principle, in careful, thoughtful
words, the product of private reading and
reflection, called out by some natural occasion.
Undoubtedly, the subjects I have outlined are
themes for the pulpit, and for the Bible class,
as well as for the visit. But my feeling is that
the visit gives opportunities quite of its own
for didactic work. We ought to be "natural"[Pg&nbsp;189]
everywhere; but we are sometimes suspected,
or imagined, to be less so in public than in
private; and besides, in private we give and
take; we are open to question and answer;
and this may give quite special advantage to
the word spoken, quietly and pleasantly, but
pointedly, in the pastoral interview.

"PURCHASE THE OPPORTUNITY."

"The priest's lips should keep knowledge." [Mal. ii. 7.]
The Clergyman should be ready everywhere
to be the teacher on the great subjects
which he is supposed to make his own. He will
never intrude instruction, or parade it; but he
will everywhere be on the watch for the occasion
for it, &#7952;&#958;&#945;&#947;&#959;&#961;&#945;&#950;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#953;&#961;&#8057;&#957;,
"purchasing the opportunity," [Eph. v. 10.] at the cost of
care.

VISITATION OF THE SICK.

And here I may come again to that important
branch of visitation, the visitation of the
sick. The Church, as we well know, provides
a Form of Visitation; most helpful and suggestive
in its principles and outline for all. But
it is, as you are aware, imposed by the Canon
(lxvii.) only on such Clergymen (very scarce
personages) as have no licence to preach. As
a fact, we Presbyters are left to our own discre[Pg&nbsp;190]tion
in this sacred part of our work; and that
discretion we should seek prayerfully to cultivate.
How different are the circumstances in
each one of an average series of sick-visits!
As I write the words, such a series from my own
past days rises up before me; and I transcribe
a few recollections from the book of memory.

A SERIES OF VISITS.

W.S. is a retired tradesman, a thoughtful
and rather reticent man; brought up a Socinian,
and professedly such still. I am trying to lay
siege to him, not without merciful tokens of
hope from the Lord. And the simple plan is,
not to open the controversy between Socinus
and Scripture, but to arrange that each visit
shall have its short Scripture reading, its
friendly talk, and its prayer, all bearing mainly
on the deadliness of sin and the wonder and
glory of salvation. I happen to know that the
married daughter of W.S., a very intelligent
woman, was brought from heresy to a divine
Saviour's feet by means of a sermon, not on
Christ's Godhead, but on the sinfulness of sin.

T.H. is a sturdy old blacksmith, old enough
to have been bred in the infidel school of
Carlile (quite another person than Carlyle), and[Pg&nbsp;191]
steeped in old-fashioned Chartism. He always
has the newspaper on his now helpless knees,
never the Bible; but he almost always has
some Bible difficulty ready for me. It is
pleasant to be able this afternoon to show him,
holding the page up before his eyes, that his
last stumbling-block is one of his own (or his
friends') bold invention. He meets civility
always civilly, and never resents a natural
transition from the last bit of politics to the
Gospel. But it is a hard, sad case. The
Lord only knows how the apparently motionless
conscience fares.

T.G. is a fine, manly artizan, a coach-painter,
scarcely yet in middle life; lately the
somewhat bitter and very self-satisfied critic of
his good and devoted wife's simple faith. I
have had rather discouraging talks with T.G.
before to-day; but now he is very ill, and a
few Sunday afternoons ago he sent across the
road for the Curate, who to his own solemn joy
found him broken down in unmistakable conviction
of sin, asking what he must do to be
saved. It is a blessed thing to visit him now,
for already the rays of the eternal sun are[Pg&nbsp;192]
shining between the clouds of a deeply
genuine repentance; and the visitor's task is
plain,&mdash;

"To teach him all the mercy, while he shows him all the sin."

Soon it will be my happiness, I hope, to administer
to him, as a penitent believer, with
his now happy wife and a faithful friend, the
precious Communion; and I look forward to
see him depart in due time in the peace of
God, to be with Christ, for whom already he
has learnt to testify.

Then comes another visit, to one of our
"bettermost" neighbours; this door bears, or
ought to bear, the proverbial brass knocker.
But be the door what it may be, there is great
need and great mercy inside it. The dear man,
W.T., lately in active professional life in the
home civil-service, is sinking under the most
agonizing of human maladies, and it is very near
the close; this is the second visit to-day, in his
urgent need. But, blessed be God, grace, once
absent, has found its way through the terrible
obstacle of pain, and his scarcely articulate
utterance&mdash;intelligible to his visitor only be[Pg&nbsp;193]cause
now so familiar&mdash;speaks of the joy and
rest of the Lord Jesus Christ, and of the
sufferer's longing for the salvation of another
soul, a soul very dear to him.[23]

[23] Wonderful to say (it is to me very wonderful), I have known
more than one bright conversion take place amidst the untold
pangs of such an illness.

Such visits tell upon the heart, and upon
the head, and perhaps the round among the
suffering has been long enough to-day. To-morrow
we will try to get a quiet half-hour
with W.R., a shopkeeper, sinking in consumption;
a man of no common natural refinement
and thoughtfulness, but long troubled with that
sort of scepticism which is generated (who
knows in how many cases?) by the mysteries,
not of God's revelation, but of His providence.
For him, too, the visitor's business is to lay
a gentle siege, "here a little, and there a
little," trying never to lose patience with objections
and difficulties, but rather to sympathize
with them as to their pains, and then to suggest
the answer in Jesus Christ. And oh joy, the
Lord is finding the way in, through His Word,
and the clouds are passing away from the[Pg&nbsp;194]
man's mind, and soul, and forehead, as he is
getting to "know Whom he believes."[24]

[24] I possess a beautiful little Bible given me by dear W.R., who
has now been many years with Christ. Such a gift is a very
sacred treasure to a Pastor.

Then we can walk round the corner&mdash;how
the beloved streets and lanes rise up in memory
before me as I write!&mdash;to see J.F., a young
printer, dying in the brightest joy and peace,
won from carelessness to a solid faith by the
work and witness of earnest dissenting Christians,
but glad and thankful to receive the
Communion of the Lord from his dear Vicar,
or his Vicar's son. And then five minutes'
walk takes us to a tiny alley in the denser part
of the widespread parish, where a poor life-long
cripple, W.G., lies day and year upon his little
bed&mdash;little, because though the head is full-sized,
and the brain within it is an adult brain,
the body has never grown since childhood.
Here is a case for steady sympathy, and also
for gentle and steady aiming at instruction as
well as comfort. And then, not far off, we will
take the privilege of a quiet visit to an aged
Christian woman, J.N. In long past years[Pg&nbsp;195]
loving saints found her pining in extreme
poverty, and sunk in a dull, despairing indifference.
Now it is a great spiritual help to
sit in her little attic beside her, and draw her
on to speak (she is no loquacious person by
nature, and needs drawing on) about the needs
of the soul, and the glorious fulness of the Son
of God. She is no common Christian; not
only in life but in thought this appears. At
the time of her conversion, she could not read
a letter. Since then, she has repeatedly read
with great spiritual insight and enjoyment
Archbishop Leighton's Commentary on St
Peter. Here is a room in which the visitor
learns quite as much as he teaches. And so
he does in a still smaller and much darker
room, three minutes' distant from J.N.'s.
There lies blind R.W., in his strong days
the head-servant of an old farmer of our
village, and to all appearance as little capable
of spiritual interests as the animals he fed.
But on his sick-bed, the comfortless couch of
many declining years, a loving visitor, a devoted
lady-worker, has found him out, and the Lord
has found him out through her. He never[Pg&nbsp;196]
knew A from B in his life, and never will.
But do you want proof of the power of grace
to quicken mind, as well as to convert soul?
Come with me up the stairs into dear old
R.W.'s darksome room, and in the course of
our talk you shall hear his quavering voice
saying things, quite humbly and naturally, about
the glory of his Saviour, and the way of salvation,
and the joy and peace of his heart in God,
which are not only loving ascriptions but clear
and sound divinity. It is good to be with him.

I have spoken mainly, though not only, of
cases of warm interest and encouragement.
Of course there are sorrowful and heart-trying
visits to the sick. One such, to poor old
T.H., I have described. And we might see
the much older A.C., a woman of near ninety
years, who seems impenetrable to the true
light, though grateful and kindly towards the
visitor; and B.F., older still, ninety-six, so
vain of her age that it is difficult to get her
off the beloved theme; and J.G., a steady,
self-righteous man; and C.W., clever, and
disposed to scoff; and T.B., known to be
leading a very evil life, civil, but immovable.[Pg&nbsp;197]

RESOLVE TO BE A VISITOR.

The work is very various, very interesting,
and full of the call for "long patience," while
full, too, of blessed encouragements and surprises.
But "the time would fail me." Ah,
let me not close without saying to my younger
Brother how deeply humbling to me are the
memories of those pastoral days, and humbling
above all as I look back and wish now, in vain
for ever, that I had visited more, among both
the sick and the whole. "Enter not into
judgment with Thy servant, O Lord"; "To
Thee only it appertaineth to forgive sins."

My dear younger Brother, resolve that by
the grace of God you will be a visitor, whatever
else you are, or are not. And be a visitor
who respects his neighbours, who feels with
them, whose heart lives with them, and who on
the other hand watches over his call to instruct
them, to clear up and deepen their thoughts of
self, and God, and life, and death, and salvation,
and duty, and eternity.

A CONVERSION AT EIGHTY-SIX.

"Go, labour on; spend and be spent."
There is a sure reward, seen or not seen as
yet; and often the most unlikely quarter shall
prove the quarter of blessing, and the last shall[Pg&nbsp;198]
be first. One recollection, drawn out of my
earliest childhood, shall close this wandering
talk. It is of dear old Mrs E., then aged quite
eighty-six. She must have been born under the
rule of King George the Second. A farmer's
widow, she had been absolutely and perfectly
respectable all her life, and was entirely satisfied
with her state and her prospects for the next
world. My dear Father, and his devoted
Curate of those days, the Rev. W.D., not
seldom saw her, but without leaving any
apparent impression on her conscience. At
last that conscience woke. The Curate read
a chapter, in her hearing, to her pious invalid
daughter, who had sought her mother's conversion
for years in prayer, and had lived true
Christianity all the while in her mother's home.
And on a sudden, something in that chapter
(it was the third of Romans) said to the old
lady, "You have lived eighty years in the
world, and never done a single thing for the
love of God." The conviction was tremendous
in its depth and quality, and it lasted long.
But a very bright light followed, and shone
with holy fulness through what proved to be[Pg&nbsp;199]
several remaining years of beautiful old age.
She rejoiced in her adorable Saviour with joy
unspeakable, a joy meanwhile perfectly sober
and full of the good fruits of loving righteousness.
She died at last, singing, or rather
musically murmuring, Rock of Ages.[25] And
my recollection, across seven-and-forty years,
is of that dear old lady of the past, sitting
upright in her parlour, as my Mother led me in
to see her, and wearing a look upon her face
which I can only now describe as a remembered
ray of light.

[25] My dear Father, many years ago, published a full narrative
of Mrs E.'s last days, in a little volume of pastoral recollections,
Pardon and Peace.



[Pg&nbsp;200]

"I love, I love my Master;
I will not go out free;
For He is my Redeemer,
He paid the price for me.

"I would not leave His service,
It is so sweet and blest,
And in the weariest moments
He gives the truest rest."

Miss F.R. Havergal.

CHAPTER IX.CONTENTS

THE CLERGYMAN AND THE PRAYER BOOK.

[Pg&nbsp;202]

Dear pages of ancestral prayer,
Illumined all with Scripture gold,
In you we seem the faith to share
Of saints and seers of old.

Whene'er in worship's blissful hour
The Pastor lends your heart a voice,
Let his own spirit feel your power,
And answer, and rejoice.

[Pg&nbsp;203]

In the present chapter I deal a little with
the spirit and work of the Clergyman in his
ministration of the ordered Services of the
Church, reserving the work of the Pulpit for
later treatment.

THE PRAYER BOOK NOT PERFECT BUT INESTIMABLE.

Let me begin by a brief reminder of the
greatness of the spiritual treasure which we
possess in the Book by which we minister.
How shall I speak of it as I would? "The
Prayer Book isn't inspired, I know," said an
old coast-guardsman some years ago to a friend
of mine, "but, sure and certain, 'tis as bad as
inspired!" "I find the Liturgy," said another
veteran, Charles Simeon, "as superior to all
modern compositions as the work of a philosopher
on any deep subject is to that of a
schoolboy who understands scarcely anything[Pg&nbsp;204]
about it." "All that the Church of England
needs to make her the glory of all Churches,"
said Simeon's friend, the late Rev. William
Marsh, "is the spirit of her own services."

I am not so blind as to maintain that our
Book is ideally perfect, and that its every
sentence is infallible. It is not quite literally
"as bad as inspired." After using it in ministration
for nearly five-and-twenty years I own
to the wish that here and there the wording, or
the arrangement, or the rubrical direction, had
been otherwise in some detail, perhaps in some
important detail. I do certainly wish very
earnestly indeed that the Revisers of 1661-2
had expressed themselves more happily in that
Rubric about "Ornaments" which within recent
years has proved&mdash;little as they expected
it, or intended it, to do so&mdash;such a fertile
field of discord. But for all this, my five-and-twenty
years' ministerial use of the Prayer
Book has only deepened my sense of its
inestimable general value and greatness.

If a temperate and equitable revision were
possible at the present time I should welcome
the prospect on most accounts. But it seems[Pg&nbsp;205]
to me plain that it is not at present possible.
And meanwhile I thank God from my inmost
heart for the actual Prayer Book as a whole.

Let me point out a very few of the claims of
the Book on our love and gratitude; and now
specially in view of what we may sometimes
hear said about it by Christians not of our
own Church.

i. Observe its profound and searching
spirituality. It is quite true that in a certain
sense the Book takes all who use it for
granted; it assumes them to be worshippers in
spirit and in truth; it does not pray for them,
or lead them in public worship to pray for
themselves, as for those who do not know and
love God, who have not come to Christ. But
then what form of public, common prayer can
well do this? And meantime the Book does,
especially in the service of the Communion,
and particularly in that too often omitted part
of it, the "longer Exhortation," beginning
Dearly beloved in the Lord, throw the worshipper
back upon himself for self-examination.
This is just the method of St Paul in his
addresses to the Christian community. He[Pg&nbsp;206]
writes to all as "saints," "faithful," "elect,"
"sanctified." What does he mean? Does he
mean that those glorious terms are satisfied by
the fact that all have been baptized, or even
that all are communicants at the sacred Table?
Not at all. He takes all for granted as being
what they profess to be, when he greets the
community [Rom. viii. 9; 1 Cor. xvi. 22; 2 Cor. xiii. 5; Gal. v. 6.]. But he says also, "If
any man have not the Spirit of Christ
he is none of His"; "If any man
love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be
anathema"; "Examine yourselves, whether ye
be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know
ye not that Jesus Christ is in you&mdash;except ye
be &#7936;&#948;&#8057;&#954;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#953;, counterfeits?" "In Jesus Christ
neither circumcision availeth anything, nor
uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by
love." Such sentences throw a flood of holy
and searching light on the sense in which St
Paul "took them all for granted." And the
Prayer Book is in true harmony with both
parts of the Apostle's method.

WHAT IT TAKES FOR GRANTED IN THE WORSHIPPER.

And then, think what the Book does thus
searchingly and helpfully "take for granted."
It assumes a deep sense of sin, such a sense[Pg&nbsp;207]
as is indeed "grievous unto us." It takes for
granted our deep desire both for pardon and
for spiritual victory. It assumes our desire to
be "kept this day without sin"; to "follow the
only God with pure hearts and minds"; to "be
continually given to all good works"; to "be
enabled by the Lord to live according to His
will"; to have "all our doings ordered by His
governance"; to have "such love to Him
poured into our hearts that we may love Him
above all things." It assumes our desire to
"read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest all the
Holy Scriptures." It assumes our readiness
to "suffer on earth for the testimony of the
truth, looking up steadfastly to heaven, and by
faith beholding the glory that shall be revealed."
It assumes our adoring devotion to our Lord
Jesus Christ, and that we present "ourselves,
our souls and bodies, a reasonable, holy, and
living sacrifice," to our God.

I heard a few years ago of a remarkable case
of secession from the Church of England. A
thoughtful and conscientious man left us because,
as he said, he could no longer seem to
concur in such words of intense spiritual reality[Pg&nbsp;208]
and surrender while he did not fully mean them.
On his principles, I fear there ought to be a
large exodus from our Church. But that is not
the fault of the Church, or of the Church's
Book. It is the fault of the worshippers, and
it is a solemn call to us not so much to criticize
the Liturgy as to "examine ourselves."

THE PRAYER BOOK AS A WEAPON.

In this connexion I am reminded of a characteristic
saying of an honoured friend of mine,
now at rest with the Lord after a long and
faithful ministry. He was one of those men
who instinctively speak strongly, perhaps sometimes
roughly; but such roughness is often
useful. "The Prayer Book," said he, "is
always handy to throw at people's heads";
figuratively, of course, not literally. He slung
it out in vigorous quotations from his pulpit,
point blank at the unreality, and formalism, and
pharisaism, and love of this present evil world,
which too often underlies the most precise
"churchmanship" and the most punctual
church-going.

My old friend's strong word may carry a
suggestion to some of my younger Brethren;
though I would advise their deferring a projectile[Pg&nbsp;209]
use of the Book till they are seniors in the
Church. But the youngest Minister of Christ,
in all loving modesty, may reach many a conscience
(beginning with his own) by well-timed
words from the Prayer Book, showing what the
Book takes for granted in the worshipper.

SCRIPTURALITY OF THE BOOK.

ii. Next I point to the abundant and loyal
Scripturality of the Prayer Book. I venture
to say that no Service Book in the world is
quite like ours in this. This characteristic lies
on the surface; in the wealth of Scripture
poured out in every service before the people;
Psalms, Lessons, Canticles, Epistle, Gospel,
Introductory Sentences, Decalogue, Comfortable
Words. At the Font, in the Marriage
Ordinance, at the Grave, it is still the same;
Scripture, in our mother tongue, full and free,
runs everywhere. And below the surface it is
the same. Take almost any set of responses,
or any single prayer, and see the strong warp
of the Bible in it all.

*"THE PREFACE" ON THE BIBLE.

And then go for a
moment from the Services to the Preface of
the Book, and see what the Fathers of our
English Liturgy thought and intended about
the place of the Holy Scriptures in worship.[Pg&nbsp;210]
I hope my Brethren have all read that "Preface"
with care; I mean, of course, the whole
length of introductory matter which precedes
the Tables of Lessons; nothing of it later than
1662, most of it (indeed all but the first section,
written by Sanderson) dating in substance
from 1549.[26] I hope it has all been read by you;
but I am not quite certain of it, so little attention
is at present called to those important and
authoritative statements of principle. But however
well you may already know them, they
will repay another reading; and so you will be
reminded again that the really first thought in
the minds of the men who gave us our Prayer
Book in English was to let "the Word
of God have free course and be glorified" [2 Thess. iii. 1.] in all
the worship of the people. Those men were
learned in the past, and they reverenced history
and continuity. But they reverenced still more
the heavenly Word, and where they found the
ample reading and hearing of it impeded by
even immemorial usage, the usage had to give
way, without reserve, to the Bible.

[26] I do not forget that some modifications in detail, as to the
Lectionary, are quite recent.[Pg&nbsp;211]

Yes, the Prayer Book is, whatever else it
is, searchingly, overflowingly Scriptural; full of
the Bible, full of Christ. Let us drink its principles
and its manner in, that they may come
out in our life and our preaching.

And now for a few simple practical suggestions
on our ministerial use of the Book.

USE THE BOOK WITH DILIGENCE.

i. First, I would entreat my younger Brother
to resolve in the Lord's name that his own use
of the Prayer Book in his ministration be to
him a thing of sacred importance and personal
reality. We need to form such a resolve deliberately,
and to watch and pray over it. Do
we not know what strong temptations lie in the
other direction? We have to use these forms
over and over again; before many years are
over perhaps we could "take" a whole service,
except the appointed Scriptures, without looking
at the book: is it not too easy under such
conditions to read as those who read not, and
to pray as those who pray not? And all too
often the Clergyman, younger or older, allows
himself almost consciously, almost on principle,
to form an inadequate estimate of his Prayer-Book
work. Perhaps he regards the prayers[Pg&nbsp;212]
as in such a sense "the voice of the Church"
that he is willing to be little more than a
machine through which the Church offers them.
Or perhaps on the other hand he lets himself
forget their immense importance, under a strong,
and just, sense of the sacred importance of the
Sermon. He is alive and awake in the pulpit,
and seeks his Lord's presence there, and realizes
it as sought; but in the desk&mdash;he goes by
himself, and much of his precious time there
is spent in thought which wanders to the ends
of the earth while his voice does its decent but
somnambulatory part alone.

*USE IT WITH LIVING REALITY.

I can only appeal
with all my heart to my younger Brother not
to let it be thus with him. And the only effective
recipe against the trouble is faith, exercised
in prayer and watching, with a full recollection
of the urgent importance of the matter. For
indeed it is all-important that the servant of
God should be "given wholly to" his work, at
the reading desk, at the lectern, at the Table,
at the Font.

PRAY THE PRAYERS.

It is easy to say, as it is often said, that
we "must not preach the prayers," must not
obtrude our personality in leading the devo[Pg&nbsp;213]tions
of the congregation; that our part is to be
regular and audible, and otherwise to "efface
ourselves." Most certainly we ought not to
preach the prayers, in public any more than in
private. But then, we ought to pray them.
Most certainly we ought not to obtrude our
personality upon the thought of the worshippers.
But then, we ought to serve them
with our personality, and we can best do this,
surely, by a spirit and a manner which is unmistakably
that of the fellow-worshipper, who feels
himself to be in the presence of the King, and
knows that the petitions and the promises are
for him at least a holy reality. I am perfectly
well aware that it is not easy to steer between
a more or less mechanical manner and a
demonstrative one, and that perhaps of two
evils the former is the less. But I am sure
it is possible to steer the right line, by using
sanctified common-sense, and asking for a little
candid counsel from those who hear us, and
above all by being what we seek to seem&mdash;true
worshippers, spiritually awake and humbly
reverent.

As long as man is man, so long will the law[Pg&nbsp;214]
of sympathy hold good. And by that law it
is certain that the way to promote, so far as
we can, a spirit and tone of true worship in our
people is to possess&mdash;and to show&mdash;that spirit
ourselves, as we lead, and also join, their
worship. Never declaim the prayers, but
always pray them, from the soul and with the
voice.

"GIVE ATTENDANCE TO THE READING" OF THE LESSONS.

ii. I spoke just now of what we should do
at the lectern. Let me earnestly press upon
my Brethren the great duty of rightly reading
the Lessons. Do you want to carry out the
will and purpose of the Church of England?
As we have seen, that purpose is above everything
to glorify the Word of God. See then
that the Lesson, as read by you, is as audible,
as intelligible, as impressive as you can make
it. Take care beforehand that you understand
its points, its arguments, its emphasis. Take
counsel with yourself, and perhaps with others,
about ways and means for bringing these
things out in your public reading. Remember
that for very many of your people (I fear I am
right in saying so) the Church Lessons are the
most solid pieces of Scripture they ever hear,[Pg&nbsp;215]
or ever read. Many years ago it was not uncommonly
said that in "these days of universal
reading" we might perhaps abbreviate our
Church Lessons. But since that time it has
been more fully and sadly realized, by very
many of us at least, that universal reading
does not mean universal Bible reading by any
means, but much rather universal newspaper
and novel reading. The heavenly Book is
terribly unfamiliar to multitudes of churchgoers,
as you will find, if you ask, when you
go about your parish; of this we have already
thought. Therefore, make all you can of the
reading of the Lessons in public worship.
&#928;&#961;&#8057;&#963;&#949;&#967;&#949; &#964;&#8135; &#945;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#957;&#8061;&#963;&#949;&#953;, says the
Apostle to Timothy, "Give attention to the
reading" [1 Tim. iv. 13.]; does he not mean, be diligent in
reading the Scripture to the people? The
precept is as much as ever in point in our
day.

OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED BY THE OCCASIONAL SERVICES.

iii. As regards the occasional services, Public
and Private Baptism, Marriage, Burial, I would
earnestly counsel my Brother to put personality
into his reading in them all, in the moderate
sense indicated above. The fact that such[Pg&nbsp;216]
occasions are necessarily more or less special
in their interest for some at least of those
present should never be forgotten; bring the
power of a sympathetic interest and earnestness
to bear upon it. In administering Public
Baptism I have often realized this to a very
peculiar degree. Who can feel the least fondness
for little children, and have the slightest
insight into a parent's heart, and not do so?
Our service is undoubtedly long; very long
indeed when accompanied by a chorus of
perhaps several little crying voices. But let
the servant of God "be in it," and he will find
himself much more touched than troubled by
the babies' lamentations as he speaks to the
sponsors about the young helpless souls, and
turns to the Lord of all grace to dedicate them
to Him and to invoke His blessing on them
for time and eternity, and then applies the
watery Seal of all the promises to their small
foreheads. I have always found it very hard
to get through that service with a perfectly
steady voice; and after all, why should we be
so careful to do so?

Private Baptism is indeed a special occasion.[Pg&nbsp;217]
There are reasons, no doubt, why it must not
be too readily administered; in some parishes
parents, for one reason or another, too often
try to secure "a christening" in private, on
insufficient grounds, with no intention of a
public dedication afterwards. But when the
case is clear, and you are at the little suffering
one's side, perhaps with a distressed mother
close beside it and you, see to it that you
so minister the rite, so read the few precious
words, as both to sympathize and to teach.
Let me add that Private Baptism often brings
the Clergyman into a house where religion is
utterly neglected; and the opportunity may be
a priceless one, if the power of love and spiritual
reality is with you in the work.

And when you officiate at a Wedding,
different as the conditions are from those just
remembered, still do not forget that for at least
some there present the hour is a deeply moving
one. And is not the Marriage Service a noble
one to read, to interpret, with its peculiar
mingling of immemorial and archaic simplicity
with a searching depth of scriptural exhortation,
and a bright wealth of divine benedictions?[Pg&nbsp;218]
Throw the power of a true man's solemnized
sympathy into your reading of that service.

PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF THE BURIAL SERVICE.

Of the ritual of the Grave I hardly need to
speak. I know only too well that there are
funerals and funerals. There are occasions
of unrelieved sadness. There are occasions
when the Minister's heart is chilled by a manifest
and utter indifference. But the saddest,
dreariest of burials is an opportunity for the
Lord. Whether or no you see your way to
give an address, let it be seen that you are
dealing with God in the prayers, and read the
Lessons "as one that pleadeth with men."

A brief word in passing on the problem
raised by some of the phrases of our Burial
Service. Let me call attention to the studied
generality of the words, In sure and certain
hope of the resurrection to eternal life. Before
1662 this ran "in sure ... hope of resurrection,
etc.," which, as you will observe, expressly
applied the "hope" to that case of burial; the
change was evidently made on purpose to
relieve conscience in the matter. Then remember
that the whole service is constructed,
like all our services, for the member of the[Pg&nbsp;219]
Christian community taken on his profession;
and that assumption, unless flagrant facts withstand
it, is to be made, in public ordinance, as
much at the grave as elsewhere. And do not
forget that hope, be it ever so "trembling,"
is never forbidden at a grave-side. I am no
advocate of what is called "the larger hope";
I dare not be. But I am deeply convinced
that mercies of the Lord, in cases quite beyond
our possible knowledge, are experienced in the
very act of departure.

"Betwixt the stirrup and the ground
Mercy I sought, mercy I found."

That instance has many parallels; and God
only knows their limits. Never should we say,
whatever we may awfully fear, that such and
such a soul is to our knowledge lost.

As regards the practical management of
extreme cases, the young Clergyman will of
course act altogether under his Incumbent.
And the young Incumbent will remember that
he can have recourse to his Bishop for counsel.

THE HOLY COMMUNION.

iv. Let me say one special word on our
administration of the precious ritual of the[Pg&nbsp;220]
Table of the Lord. I am not attempting
here any discussion of its doctrinal aspects in
detail. For myself, as I have said elsewhere,
I make no secret of long-settled "Evangelical"
convictions. I regard the Holy Eucharist as
above all things else the Lord's way of sealing
to His true Israel the unutterable benefits
of the New and Everlasting Covenant, rather
than an occasion on which He infuses into
them His glorified Manhood. His sacred
Body and Blood are, for me, the Body and the
Blood as they were, once for all, at Calvary,
and as they are not therefore literally now;
and my participation in them is accordingly
my participation in the virtues of the Atoning
Sacrifice, there once and for ever wrought and
offered. But this is by the way. I speak now
of our spirit and manner in the administration,
in respect of some principles which are little if
at all affected, it seems to me, by even grave
differences of doctrinal theory. Alas, at the
present day it is too often the case that
the communicant is fairly bewildered by the
varieties of Communion ritual, or by the complications
of it. Ought this to be so, on any[Pg&nbsp;221]
theory of the Eucharist? Did I for one believe
our adorable and beloved Lord to be locally
present (I use the words not technically but
practically) on the Holy Table as nowhere else
here on earth, I think that all my instinct would
go towards a reverence whose depth was manifested
not by an elaborate ceremonial but by
the most solemn possible simplicity of act. A
ritual whose details must be matter of careful
practice, and which suggests almost the need of
a Spanish master-of-the-ceremonies&mdash;ought that
to be the natural effect of an, as it were, invisible
Presence?

SIMPLICITY AND REVERENCE.

But probably I write for readers whose
inclinations or risks lie little in that direction.
And for them I say, let your administration
of the blessed Communion always combine a
manifest reverence and a restful simplicity.
The Lord is there, the Master of His own
Table, the Prince of His own Covenant, ready
to give His people His royal Seal by your
hands. And His people are there, to have
their sacred interview with Him. Do not
obstruct their view, their colloquy; humbly aid
it. Be their servant, as in His presence;[Pg&nbsp;222]
obtrude yourself as little as you possibly
can.

ADDRESSES ON THE PRAYER BOOK.

As I draw the chapter to a close, I make
one practical recommendation to my younger
Brethren. It is, to do what they can to
interest their people in the Prayer Book, and
to promote its intelligent use, by taking what
opportunities they can to talk to them about it.
Many a private occasion for this will no doubt
present itself. But if now and then a simple
lecture on the history of the Prayer Book can
be given, and if possible well illustrated, it will
be very useful; and so will be a series of week-night
devotional addresses on the teaching of
the Prayer Book. And let not the need of
plain matter-of-fact explanation of obsolete
terms and technical phrases be forgotten on
such occasions. Of course the Curate will
carefully consult his Incumbent on the whole
matter. But few of my elder Brethren will not
feel with me that such "talks upon the Prayer
Book," carefully considered and conducted,
whether by Incumbent or by Curate, may
be of the greatest use, under our Master's
blessing.[Pg&nbsp;223]

"MORE CEREMONIAL, LESS WORSHIP."

One last word, and I have done with these
suggestions. An English Bishop once told
me that he had lately met a gentleman who,
after ten years' residence abroad, returned to
England, and to his place as a worshipper in
our Churches. "Do you remark particularly
any change or advance in what you see
there?" "I observe on the one hand much
more ceremonial, on the other hand, apparently,
much less worship. Fewer kneel, fewer
respond, fewer around me seem devoutly attentive."
Less worship! Is it so indeed? Let
the very opposite be the case, so far as our
influence and teaching can have effect, with
our fathers' Prayer Book in our hands, and
in our hearts.



[Pg&nbsp;224]

"Lo, God is here; Him day and night
Th' united quires of angels sing;
To Him, enthron'd above all height,
Heaven's hosts their noblest praises bring;
Disdain not, Lord, our meaner song,
Who praise Thee with a stammering tongue.

"Being of beings, may our praise
Thy courts with grateful fragrance fill;
Still may we stand before Thy face,
Still hear and do Thy sovereign will;
To Thee may all our thoughts arise,
Ceaseless, accepted sacrifice."

J. Wesley, from Tersteegen

CHAPTER X.CONTENTS

PREACHING (i.).

[Pg&nbsp;226]

Earthen vessels, frail and slight,
Yet the golden Lamp we bear;
Master, break us, that the light
So may fire the murky air;
Skill and wisdom none we claim,
Only seek to lift Thy Name.

[Pg&nbsp;227]

I have on purpose reserved the subject of
Preaching for our closing pages. Preaching
is, from many points of view, the goal and
summing up of all other parts and works of the
Ministry. What we have said already about
the Clergyman's life and labour, in secret, in
society, in the parish; what we have said about
his study and use of the Book of Common
Prayer; all, so far as it has been true, ought to
contribute its suggestions as we approach this
great theme.

THE PULPIT THE CENTRAL POINT.

For, indeed, "the Pulpit" (I use the word in
its widest application, wide enough to cover
the mission-room desk, or the preaching place
in the open air) is no mere isolated item in the
midst of other matters which call for a Clergyman's
attention. If the man is working, and[Pg&nbsp;228]
ordering his work, aright, the Pulpit will not
be a something which has to be taken by the
way, a link in a long chain in which committees,
clubs, and social gatherings, and the like, are
other and co-ordinate links. It will be a
sacred central point, the living heart of the
busy life, to which everything will bear relation.
To the Pulpit everything will somehow converge,
and from the Pulpit everything will
be influenced. As the Pastor moves about
amongst his people, he will be gathering incessantly,
from all parochial places and seasons,
material which will tell upon his sermons; he
will be getting to know his people's minds and
lives with an intimacy which will give his
preaching to them a point which otherwise it
could not have. And when he stands in the
Pulpit, this continually accumulating knowledge
will come out, not indeed in the way of diluting
or distorting his Gospel, but so as to give its
eternal and holy message a point and closeness
of application which will ensure its "coming
home," as God gives the blessing.

TEMPTATIONS TO FORGET THIS.

It needs thought and care to keep the
parish and the sermon thus en rapport. But[Pg&nbsp;229]
such thought and care is infinitely well worth
taking. The Clergyman who longs to be useful
for his Lord in the highest degree he can be,
cannot possibly think lightly of his sermons.
Yet he may be tempted, half unconsciously, to
treat them too lightly in practices, particularly
if he is beset with a consciousness that he is
not "a born preacher," or if he stands in the
opposite danger of having a "fatal" facility
of speech. Let the Clergyman only remember
that his sermon, his public delivery of instruction,
of exhortation, in the Lord's name,
is not to be an exhibition of his own powers
of thought or utterance, but a faithful message-bearing
to his own flock, in the light of what
he knows of Christ and the Word on the one
side, and of the needs of the flock on the other,
and he will find a most useful encouragement, or
a most useful corrective, as the need may be.
"O my Lord, I am not eloquent,"
[Exod. iv. 10.] will be no disheartening thought, as he carries to
the pulpit the ever-growing weight of pastoral
experience, all giving point and freshness
to the unalterable message. And the secret
temptation to think the sermon a light thing[Pg&nbsp;230]
because mere words come easy, will be powerfully
counteracted in the other case not only by
contact with the realities of life in the daily
work, but by remembering that the sermon will
have to do with not an abstract audience but
these particular souls and lives thus laid on the
man's conscience and affections.

THE PASTOR PREACHES TO THOSE PARTICULAR HEARERS.

Let me repeat it as earnestly as I can. The
sermon, if it is to be what it should be, should
be affected at every point by the facts of the
preacher's own inner life, and by those of his
intercourse with his people. Those facts must,
of course, be thoughtfully weighed and handled.
The tact which is so important in a Pastor,
and which is best learned and developed in the
school of Christ's love, will see instinctively
how to apply in preaching the experience
gained in prayer, in conversation, in every
branch of ministering life. We shall remember
that indefinite harm, not good, may be done
when a man, particularly a young man, unwisely
preaches what may fairly seem to be
personalities; I have known some sad instances
in point here. But taking that for granted,
assuming the good sense and sympathy of[Pg&nbsp;231]
the preacher, I am quite sure that the most
eloquent sermon, adapted to any audience, is
far less likely to be blessed and used by our
Lord than the sermon which is penetrated
with the Pastor's personal intimacy with that
particular audience, and which goes therefore
straight from him to them.

It has been well said that preaching may be
described as "truth through personality"; not
merely the presentation somehow of so many
facts and thoughts, but the presentation of
them through the medium of a living man, who
brings into the pulpit his heart, his character,
his experience, and so gives out his message.
We may add to this suggestive dictum that the
true pastoral sermon is also "truth to personalities";
the living man's delivery of the
message to living men and women whose life,
more or less, he knows. And so it presupposes
some real amount of pastoral intercourse,
intelligently brought to bear on pulpit
work.

PREPARE SERMON IN THE PARISH.

I linger a little over these thoughts, though
they are little more than introductory. For
experience tells me how easily, in these days,[Pg&nbsp;232]
the Clergyman is tempted to dislocate his
"parish work" from his sermons, to the great
loss of one or both parts of his duty. And if
once he begins to think of his sermons as a
thing really apart, which must be got through
somehow, but rather as a mere duty than as
a vital ministerial function, the results will be
sad for the sermons. So I lay stress on the
thought that the sermon-preparation ought to
go on not only in the study, over the Word,
but in the parish, over the hearers of it. The
more constantly this is recollected, and put in
practice, the less fear will there be that the
sermon will be a weariness either to people
or to preacher.

"LABOUR IN THE WORD."

But let me, however, entreat my younger
Brother, by any and every means, to watch
and pray against a slack or low view of his
function as a preacher. From very many
quarters at the present day we are invited to
slight our sermon-labour. Sometimes it is
"work," organization, committees, which is set
against the sermon; sometimes it is the reading-desk
and the Communion Table&mdash;the
liturgical functions of the Ministry. Let[Pg&nbsp;233]
pastoral activities and holy rites alike have
ample place in our thoughts and work; but for
Christ's sake, my Brother in the ministry of
the Word and Sacraments, do not forget the
Word. A Christian Church where preaching
sinks to a low ebb, where the labour of public
teaching and exhortation is neglected, in favour
either of machinery or ritual, cannot possibly&mdash;I
dare to say it deliberately&mdash;be in a truly
healthy state now, and most assuredly is not
laying up health and strength for years to
come. For the very life of our flocks, and of
our Church, and for the dear glory of our
Master, let us "labour in the Word
and teaching." [1 Tim. v. 17.]

"LITHO SERMONS."

Is it necessary, in the case of any reader of
these pages, that I should not only appeal thus
in general, but add one special entreaty&mdash;always
to preach your own sermons? Probably it is
not necessary; but it may be "safe"
[Phil. iii. 2.] nevertheless. Not long ago I was distressed
to read, in the advertisement columns of an
excellent Church newspaper, a conspicuous
announcement of a series of "litho sermons,"
that is, I suppose, sermons so printed as to[Pg&nbsp;234]
look like manuscript. If such literature has
a sale, it is a miserable fact. Can these discourses
possibly be either written by a "man
of the Spirit," or used by such a man? I say,
No. The production of them (in order to
be lithographed), and the use of them in their
"litho" state, are untruthful acts, untruthful
in the very sanctuary of truth. The Lord
pardon&mdash;and the Lord forbid!

Better the most stammering and incoherent
utterances of a man who loves the Lord, and
the Word, and the flock, and who in Christ's
Name does his best, than the unhallowed, and
usually, I think, vapid glibness of such acted
as well as spoken falsehoods.[27] And surely, the
more the Clergyman keeps his pulpit and his
parish in living relation, the less will he be
tempted, be it ever so remotely, by any exigencies,
to dream of expedients such as these.

[27] I am far from saying that the preacher should never get help
from other men's sermons. This may be done honestly and
usefully, in many ways. But to let another man's sermon pass
as one's own is a sin.

"DR SOUTH IN THE AFTERNOON."

Quite conceivably, there may be rare occasions
when another man's sermon may be[Pg&nbsp;235]
rightly used by you. But then, of course, you
will do it honestly and above-board, telling
your people whose it is. In Addison's Sir
Roger de Coverley there is a pleasant scene,
where the venerable Knight asks the Parson
who the preacher for next Sunday is to be.
"The Bishop of St Asaph in the morning,"
replies the good man, "and Dr South in the
afternoon."[28] That is, he was about to read,
openly and honestly, a sermon of Beveridge's,
and then a sermon of South's; neither, certainly,
in lithograph. I do not say he did the
best for his people in so doing; most certainly
he could not "speak home" to the details of
their village life, and its temptations, if he
spoke only in the phrase of the two classical
pulpit-masters. That rapport of parish and
pulpit of which I have spoken could not
have been much felt, at least on that coming
Sunday. But the good Parson was honest,[Pg&nbsp;236]
however. The practice of which I speak is
not honest.

[28] "He then shewed us his list of preachers for the whole year,
where I saw with a great deal of pleasure Archbishop Tillotson,
Bishop Sanderson, Dr Barrow, Dr Calamy, with several living
authors." (Spectator, No. 106, July 2nd, 1711.) Calamy by the
way was a Presbyterian, made one of the King's chaplains at
the Restoration.

WE MUST PREACH ATTRACTIVELY.

Let me come now to a closer view of the
preacher's work, and I will be as practical as
possible. I have besought my Brother to let
nothing tempt him to push his preaching into
a neglectful corner. Let me now beseech him
to remember that he must not only be a
diligent preacher, but do his very best to commend
his preaching to his people,&mdash;to be, in
a right sense, attractive.

I deliberately say, attractive. That word,
of course, suggests some very undesirable
applications. It is only too possible to aim at
attractiveness by bad methods. We may tone
down the Gospel-message, leaving out unpopular
and man-humbling truths, and try to
"attract" people so. We may strive to "attract"
them to hear us by doubtful external
accessories (of very different kinds), which,
after all, will rather attract attention&mdash;for a
season&mdash;to themselves, than to the message,
and the Lord. But none the less it is every
Clergyman's plain duty to make his preaching,
so far as he can, lawfully attractive. It is his[Pg&nbsp;237]
duty to see that he preaches Christ Crucified;
and "the offence of the Cross" [Gal. v. 11.] will
always occur, sooner or later, in such preaching;
but it is his duty to see that there is no
other "offence" in it, so far as he can help it.
If he so speaks of sin, and righteousness, and
judgment, that the unregenerate heart does not
like it, though the preacher has spoken wisely
and in love, that is not the preacher's fault. If
he has so magnified Christ, and the glory and
fulness of His salvation, that it sounds like
exaggeration to the unspiritual hearer, though
the words have been said in all reverent reality,
that is not the preacher's fault. But it is his
fault if he has repelled his hearers from his
message by what is not the message, but his
own setting of it; his spirit, manner, his delivery,
his neglect of some plain precautions against
prejudice and weariness. Of a few such precautions
I come now to speak; and first, of what
I may call the most external amongst them.

NEEDFUL AND NEEDLESS OFFENCES.

Beginning, then, with physical precautions
against needless "offences," &#963;&#954;&#8049;&#957;&#948;&#945;&#955;&#945;, in our
preaching I say first, let us do our best to be
audible.[Pg&nbsp;238]

AUDIBILITY: MEANS TO IT.

The word sounds almost amusingly commonplace.
But it must be said. Many more of
us Clergymen than know it, or think about it,
are not audible. The lack of training for the
bodily work of the pulpit, in our Church, is
serious; far more is done in this way among
our Nonconformist brethren.[29] And accordingly
there are numbers of young English Clergymen
who read and speak without a thought of
methodical audibility. They do not articulate
distinctly. They do not remember that the
pace and force of utterance, fit for a private
room, are quite unfit for a large building.
They do not know, perhaps, how extremely
important is the articulation of consonants, and
of final syllables of words, and of closing words
in a sentence. They do not know that a
certain equability (not monotony) of voice is
necessary, if the utterance is to "carry" to the
end of a long church, or a church of many
pillars.

[29] Let me cordially commend the Rev. J.P. Sandlands' book,
The Voice and Public Speaking. Mr Sandlands has done, and
is doing, admirable work as an oral teacher of clerical elocution,
in the intervals of his parochial labours.[Pg&nbsp;239]

PLEASANT AUDIBILITY.

Or again, they do not know, or do not
remember, that audibility is not secured by
mere loudness and bigness of voice, nor again
by raising the voice to a high pitch. "People
tell you to speak up," said that excellent elocutionist,
Mr Simeon; "but I say, speak down,"
down as regards the musical scale. Again,
the larger the building the more accentuated
must be the articulation, and the more limited
the variation of pitch; but too often this is not
thought of by the preacher.

Further, it has to be remembered, but it
is frequently forgotten, that the audibility we
should aim at is a pleasant and attractive audibility.
It is a great thing to be easily heard;
which of us does not know the combined
physical and mental labour of listening to a
sermon, or a speech, which only reaches us
indistinctly? But it is a greater thing to be
pleasantly heard; heard so that the listener
finds nothing to tire and repel in the utterance.
Here, of course, different voices give very different
advantages; but there are some common
secrets, so to speak, which all&mdash;who will make
a sacred business of it&mdash;may profitably and[Pg&nbsp;240]
effectively use. Above all, there is the secret
of quiet naturalness; the watchful avoidance
(do not forget this) of tricks and mannerisms in
delivery;[30] the watchful cultivation of the sort
of utterance which we should use in an earnest
conversation on grave subjects, with only such
differences as are suggested by the size of the
place in which we speak. Of some other
"common secrets" I shall speak when I come
to the question of style and phrase.

[30] I have known a sermon which in matter and style were really
excellent made, to some hearers at least, almost unendurable
by the accident that the preacher had got the habit of (needlessly)
clearing his throat at the end of almost every sentence.

FIND A CANDID FRIEND.

How shall we best work upon such hints?
Very largely, by the use of the plainest common-sense
and every-day observation on our
own part. But largely also by trying to find
some friend, equally kind and candid, who will
help us "to hear ourselves as others hear us."
For myself, after twenty-five years, I welcome
more and more gratefully every such criticism
as the occasion presents itself. Let the Curate
ask his Vicar to tell him without mercy if
his utterance, his articulation, is clear; if his
manner is natural; if his preaching is or is not[Pg&nbsp;241]
easy to listen to in these respects. And let
friend ask friend; let pastor ask parishioner;
let husband ask wife!

GOOD ENGLISH.

There are other directions in which we
must cultivate attractiveness. There is English
style. Here, again, gifts differ widely in detail,
yet there are common secrets open to common
use. It is open to every one to avoid, on the
one hand, an ambitious, long-worded style; on
the other, a style which many young men of
our time are in more danger of patronizing&mdash;the
slovenly, shapeless style, in which the
Queen's English is very "freely handled," and
into which the broken English of an ever-growing
slang not seldom makes its way. These
defects have only to be recognized, surely, to
be avoided, by keeping our eyes open as we
read and our ears as we hear, and by remembering
that the sacred message of the King,
while it is too great to be tricked out with false
rhetoric, is also too great to be slighted, not to
say insulted, by a really careless phraseology.

A GOOD STYLE IS A PRACTICAL POWER.

Pains will be needed, of course, as we pursue
the object of a good style. We must watch
and think. We must read and observe good[Pg&nbsp;242]
models, the written words of men who have
proved themselves powerful preachers to the
people, and indeed of men generally who are
known masters of English. We shall have,
again, to consult candid friends. But my point
is, that all this is abundantly worth our while.
A neat, straight, well-worded sentence is not
a mere literary luxury. It is a practical power.
It is far easier to listen to than a careless, formless
sentence is, and it is far easier to remember.
The truth which it conveys is much more likely,
therefore, to find its way securely into the mind,
and to lie there ready for the vivifying touch of
the Spirit of God.

I emphasize this matter of style, for in many
quarters it is much neglected, and some of my
younger Brethren do, if I mistake not, entertain
the thought that the simplicity of the Gospel is
best set forth, and God most honoured, where
plans and methods of language are neglected.
To speak about "a good style" to those who
think so, may seem perhaps little else than a
recommendation to bid for human applause in
the line of literature. But my intention is far
enough from this. Mere literary ambition, the[Pg&nbsp;243]
quest of the glory of self in this as in every
other line, is a forbidden thing to the true bondservant
of the Lord. But it is by no means
forbidden him, for his Lord's sake, to aim at
clearness, point, force of expression, that the
message may be the better taken in. God is
as little glorified by a bad style as by a bad
voice, or bad handwriting, or bad reasoning.
And by a good style I mean not a style
polished and elaborated to please fastidious
tastes (the best taste, by the way, is best
pleased with correct simplicity), but a style
which shall be both pure and plain in word and
phrase, "understandable of the people" yet
such as not to vex those who care for their
native tongue, and just enough formed and
pointed to make attention pleasant to the ear.
For average audiences, I know no style more
perfectly answering my idea than that of Mr
Spurgeon,[31] in his printed sermons of recent
years. And I happen to know that Mr
Spurgeon has always taken great and systematic
pains with his English.

[31] Since these words were written this great Christian and
preacher has passed away to his Master's presence.[Pg&nbsp;244]

FRENCH HEARERS OF ENGLISH.

Some preachers need much more than others
a hint to keep their sentences straight, and
to avoid the tangle of parentheses, long or
short. Here, again, Mr Spurgeon gives me
an admirable illustration. His sentences, never
thin or weak in matter, are always straight. If
any of my younger Brethren are tempted, as
I confess I am, in the digressive direction, I
would recommend them (if they usually preach
without writing) to write a sermon now and
then, and rigorously to exclude, or re-write, all
sentences which transgress. It occurred to me
recently, when acting as a summer chaplain in
Switzerland, to find the benefit of a different
corrective. On one particular Sunday I had
among my hearers in the morning a French
Presbyterian, in the afternoon a French Roman
Catholic, each understanding a little English;
and in each case I had special reasons for hope
and longing that the sermon might bring some
spiritual help. Instinctively, I avoided every
expression which could in the least complicate
my English and thus obscure the message to
my foreign friends. And so thankful was I
for the pruning of periods that resulted, that[Pg&nbsp;245]
I am much disposed, in all future preaching,
to put mentally before me those same two
hearers.

"WRITTEN OR EXTEMPORE?"

On that great question, Shall I preach from
writing, or not? I say very little. Speaking
quite generally, and thinking now only of the
regular church congregation, not of the mission-room
or open air, I would advise my younger
Brethren to write for some while, but usually
with an ultimate view to speech without writing.
No hard rule can be laid down. One man is
so gifted that from the first he can express himself
correctly and well without any manuscript
before him. Another finds, all his life through,
that he speaks best, and his people listen best,
when he reads (vividly and naturally) from his
prayerfully-prepared manuscript. But on the
whole, I repeat it, writing is the best discipline
for a man in his early days of Ministry, while
beyond doubt the freely-spoken sermon, like
the freely-spoken speech, (carefully enough prepared
as to matter and order,) is usually best to
listen to, and therefore should be the preacher's
goal. Some men write their sermons and then
learn them by heart for delivery. For myself, I[Pg&nbsp;246]
own this would be a severe ordeal to nerve; and
in very few cases, if I am right, does it produce
a perfectly natural effect. Not long ago, if not
now, it was a frequent custom in Scotland; and
one amusing story comes to my mind. A good
minister, known to a near relative of mine,
always thus "mandated" his sermon, and
punctually delivered it word for word. One day
a tremendous hailstorm assailed the church
windows, and not only did his parishioners fail
to hear him, but literally he lost the sound of his
own voice. Yet he dared not stop, lest memory
should play him false; and when the storm
ceased, "I found myself," he said, "with some
surprise, in a quite distant part of the sermon."

ORDER AND DIVISION.

Another important aid to attractiveness is
order and division, simply and sensibly managed.
Nothing is much more repellent, at least to
modern hearers, than an excess of arrangement;
headings and subdivisions overdone.
But nothing is more helpful to attention than
a simple, natural, luminous division, present in
the preacher's mind, announced to the audience,
and faithfully carried out. Remember this,
among many other things, in the choosing of[Pg&nbsp;247]
the text; ceteris paribus, that text is best which
best lends itself to natural division.

PAINS AND FAITH.

There are many other points, more or less
of the exterior kind, so to speak, which concern
the attractiveness of our preaching. There is
the question of length, which can only be
settled by careful and prayerful consideration
of special circumstances, with recollection of
the general principles that the morning sermon
should be short compared with that of the
evening, and that he who would reach the
hearts of the poor must not give them "sermonettes,"
but sermons. There is the question
of action, a large subject. All that I can say
is, that some action is almost always a help to
attention, but that it proves the very opposite
as soon as it seems uneasy, or a mannerism.

I have yet to deal with some thoughts about
the preacher's message, and the inmost secrets
of his power. Meanwhile, may our Lord and
Master enable us so to "labour in the Word"
that we shall think no means too humble which
will really help us to make His message plain,
and no dependence on Him too absolute for
the longed-for spiritual results.



[Pg&nbsp;248]

"Would I describe a preacher, such as Paul,
Were he on earth, would hear, approve, and own,
Paul should himself direct me. I would trace
His master-strokes, and draw from his design.
I would express him simple, grave, sincere,
In doctrine uncorrupt; in language plain,
And plain in manner; decent, solemn, chaste,
And natural in gesture; much impress'd
Himself, as conscious of his awful charge,
And anxious mainly that the flock he feeds
May feel it too; affectionate in look,
And tender in address, as well becomes
A messenger of grace to guilty men."

Cowper.

PREACHING (ii.).

For Thy sake, beloved Lord,
I will labour in Thy Word;
On the knees, in patient prayer;
At the desk, with studious care;
In the pulpit, seeking still
There to utter all Thy will.

[Pg&nbsp;251]

I pursue the subject of attractive preaching,
taking still the word attractive in its
worthiest sense, and again laying stress on the
necessity of attractiveness of the right sort.
We have looked a little already at some of the
external requisites to this end; now let us
approach some which have to do with matter
more than manner.

CONSIDERATENESS.

On the way, I pause to say a word in
general on one of the reasons why we should
do our best to speak so that our hearers shall
care to hear. The supreme reason is manifest;
it is the glory of our Master and the good of
souls. For His sake, and for the flock's sake,
we long and must strive to speak so as to draw
their attention to His message and to Himself.
But subordinate to this great motive, and in
fullest harmony with it, there is another; and[Pg&nbsp;252]
this is a motive which, once clearly apprehended,
will affect not our preaching only, but
all parts of our ministry&mdash;our conduct of public
worship, our pastoral visitation, our whole
intercourse with our neighbours. I mean, the
simple motive of a loyal and faithful considerateness
for others, as we are on the one hand
Christian men and English gentlemen, and on
the other hand servants, not masters, of the
Church and parish. Possibly this aspect of the
Pastor's public and official ministry may not
have presented itself distinctively as yet to my
younger Brother; but it cannot be recognized
and acted upon too early. Some things in our
clerical position and functions tend in their own
nature to make us forget it, if we are not
definitely awake to it beforehand. In some
respects the Clergyman, even the youngest
Curate, has dangerous opportunities for inconsiderate
public action. Take the management
of divine Service in illustration. In his manner
of reading, his tone, his pace, the Clergyman
may allow himself, only too easily, to think of
himself alone. In the reading-desk, or at the
Table of the Lord, he may consult only his own[Pg&nbsp;253]
likes and dislikes in attitude, gesture, and air.
But if so, he is greatly failing in the homely
duty of loyal considerateness. What will be
most for the happiness and edification of the
congregation? What will least disturb and
most assist true devotion? How shall the
Minister best secure that the worshippers shall
remember the Master and not be uncomfortably
conscious of the servant? The answers to
such questions will of course vary considerably
under varying conditions; but it is the principle
of the questions which I press home. Our
office, and the common consent and usage of
the Christian people, give us a position of
independence in such matters which has its
advantages, but also its very great risks; and it
is for us accordingly to handle that independence
with the utmost possible considerateness.

This thought was much upon my own mind
lately during the interesting experiences of a
Continental summer chaplaincy, to which I
referred in the last chapter. As usual in a
health resort abroad, the English residents
represented many different shades of Church
opinion and practice. By the convictions of[Pg&nbsp;254]
many long years, I am an Evangelical Churchman,
in the well-understood sense of the term;
and of those convictions I am not at all ashamed.
My manner of conducting public worship,
especially in the Communion Office, would
probably make it plain at once to most worshippers
where I stand as a Churchman. But
that does not mean, I trust, that I am to allow
myself to be inconsiderate of the feelings of
others in the matter; and on the occasions
referred to it was my earnest and anxious aim
to remember this with regard to worshippers,
and particularly communicants, whose beliefs,
or however whose sympathies, were what is
called "higher" than my own. On their
account I sought to make it plain that no
rubrical direction was neglectfully treated by
me, and that reverence of manner and action
was a sacred thing in my eyes&mdash;a reverence
not elaborated, but attentive. I hope I should
have been reverently careful whatever the composition
of the congregation was; but under
the circumstances the duty of this obvious sort
of ministerial considerateness was laid on my
heart with special weight. That duty bears[Pg&nbsp;255]
in many directions. It is, I venture to say, inconsiderate,
on the one hand, when the Clergyman
conducts the services of the Church with
a disturbing artificiality of performance. It is
inconsiderate, on the other hand, when he
conducts them with any, even the least, real
slovenliness and inattention.

TEMPTATIONS TO FORGET IT.

But if all this is true of the desk and of the
blessed Table, it is true also, and in a high
degree, of the pulpit. Singularly independent,
up to a certain point, is the position of the
preacher. He chooses his own text; he assigns
himself (at least in theory) his own length of
discourse; he is entitled, under the &aelig;gis of the
law of the land, to speak on to the end without
interruption; he is bound, within the limits of
a sanctified common-sense, to speak with the
authority of his commission. Here are powerful
temptations to an inconsiderate man, perhaps
especially to an inconsiderate young man, to
show much inconsideration. And therefore,
here is a pre-eminent occasion for the true
Pastor, who thinks, prays, loves, and is humble,
to practise the beautiful opposite. Shall you
and I seek grace to do so?[Pg&nbsp;256]

RESPECT ELDER HEARERS.

Put yourself often, my dear Brother, while
I do the same, into the position&mdash;which we
once occupied always, and often do still&mdash;of the
hearer. You, the Curate, or the young Incumbent,
have recently come into the parish, and
you are full of a young man's energy and
enterprize, and a little infected perhaps with
a common and natural belief of your time
of life, but a belief not quite true to facts,
that the world is made for young men. And
among your hearers, week by week, as you
preach from that pulpit, sit men and women
who were working, and thinking, and perhaps
believing, literally long before you were born.
Put yourself in their place. Into many of
their experiences, and their sympathies born
of experience, you cannot possibly enter personally.
You cannot feel personally how this
or that innovation of language or manner, this
or that too crude statement of your message,
this or that baldly new and perhaps by no
means true theory, aired as if it were all
obvious and of course, must look and sound
to them. You cannot feel it all; but you can
think about it. Perhaps these are educated[Pg&nbsp;257]
and refined people, and accustomed all their
lives to value clear thought and pure diction,
in any case accustomed to carefulness in the
matter and manner of the sermon. You cannot
enter into all their mental habits in your own
mental workings; but you can take account
of them, and in a loyal and thoughtful considerateness
you can remember them in practice,
and honestly aim so to prepare and to preach
as to conciliate the thoughtful and the elders.

Such considerateness will not mean the
stifling of prayerful conviction, or the failure
to be faithful as the messenger of the Lord.
But it will mean a severity upon yourself as
regards the tone and spirit of your thoughts,
and also as the manner of your utterance. You
will take pains, even at a heavy cost to self
(and such costs are always gains in the end),
so to minister as to attract the attention of the
flock, not to yourself, but to your blessed
Master and His Word; preaching "not yourself,
but Christ Jesus as Lord, and
yourself their servant for Jesus' sake." [2 Cor. iv. 5.]

With this aim of Attractiveness, then, in our
minds, and with this motive of Considerateness[Pg&nbsp;258]
beside it, let us come to some thoughts in
detail about the matter of preaching.

And here first I must bring in another word
to meet the word "attractive." That word is
"faithful."

WRONG KINDS OF ATTRACTIVENESS.

As a matter of most obvious fact (we
noticed it in the previous chapter), there is
a false and useless attractiveness, as well as
a true. There is the poor and miserable
attractiveness&mdash;it draws a certain class of
modern hearers&mdash;of mere brevity; the "ten-minute
sermon." There are no doubt exceptional
occasions when ten minutes, or even five,
may be the right limit to our utterance; but
there is something wrong with both sermon
and audience if in the regular ministration of
God's holy Word the preacher must at once
begin to stop. There is again the specious
and spurious attractiveness of excitement and
froth of manner, or of a merely emotional
appeal to perhaps not the deepest emotions, an
attraction which has little in it of that divine
magnet which draws the will and lifts the soul
in regenerate faith and surrender. There is
the attraction, tempting, but futile for the true[Pg&nbsp;259]
purposes of the pulpit, of the sermon which is
after all only a lecture, or a leading article;
full of the topics of the day, of the hour; full
perhaps of some celebrated name just immortalized
by death[32]; but not full of the eternal
message for which the pulpit exists. Most
certainly there is no divine rule which excludes
from the sermon all allusions to politics, to
society, to science, to great men; but there is
a divine rule, running through the whole precept
and example of the New Testament, which
keeps such things always subordinate to the
supreme work of preaching Jesus Christ.

[32] "I went longing to hear about Christ, and it was only
Newman from beginning to end." This was the actual lament
of an anxious soul, one Sunday in 1890.

FAITHFULNESS.

Across all our thoughts how to secure attractiveness,
as a co-ordinate line which fixes
attention to the true point, runs the word
"Faithfulness." The preacher is to be attractive
while faithful, faithful while attractive. And he
is to be attractive not for the sake of so being,
but in order that he may win an entrance for the
words of faithfulness, to his Master's praise.

WE ARE MESSENGERS.

Yes, this is what we are to be as preachers.[Pg&nbsp;260]
We are to seek "mercy of the Lord to be
faithful." [1 Cor. vii. 25.] We are not popular leaders,
looking for a cry, or passing one on. We
are not speculative thinkers, feeling out a
philosophy, communicating our guesses at truth
to a company of friends who happen to be
interested in the investigation. We are "messengers,
watchmen, and stewards of the Lord."
We are in commissioned charge of a divine,
authentic, and unalterable message. We are
the expounders of a "Word which
liveth and abideth for ever," [1 Pet. i. 23.] a Word which
man is always trying to judge and to disparage,
but which will judge man at the last
day [Joh. xii. 48.]. We are the bondservants of an absolute
Master, who is at once our Sender and our
Message, and who overhears our every word
in its delivery.

It is a grave mistake, as we saw in our
last chapter, to think that faithfulness means a
repellent utterance of "the faithful
Word." [Tit. i. 9.] But it is at least an equal mistake to
think that attractiveness means a modification
of that Word, which to the end of our
world's day will still be a "folly" and[Pg&nbsp;261]
a "stumbling-block," [1 Cor. i. 23.] in some respects, to the
unconverted soul, and will always have its
searching point and edge for the converted soul
also.

But this consideration here is only by the
way. I return from it to the matter of a right
and faithful attractiveness and some of its
higher conditions.

SECRETS FOR TRUE ATTRACTIVENESS.

"Preach the Gospel&mdash;earnestly, interestingly,
fully." Such, I believe, is the prescription
given, by the great preacher whom I cited in
the last chapter, to the Pastor who would fill his
church, and keep it full. In the first instance,
no doubt, Mr Spurgeon gives it as a prescription
to the Nonconformist Pastor; but it is quite as
much to the purpose for the Conformist, so far
as he is a Minister of the Word.[33] What I have
to say in these present pages shall run on the
lines of that sentence of good counsel.

[33] And let it never be forgotten that this is his primary function
in the mind of the Church of England. See the Priest's Ordination,
particularly its Exhortations, its Commission, and its
final Collect.

"PREACH THE GOSPEL."

i. "Preach the Gospel," that is to say Jesus
Christ, in His Person, His Work, His Offices,
[Pg&nbsp;262]His Teaching, all applied to the souls and lives
of men. Would you truly and permanently
attract, with an attraction which God will bless?
Let that be your first condition. I do not
dilate upon it here, but with all the earnestness
possible I lay it upon my younger Brother's
heart as we pass on. Preach the Gospel, that
is to say the Lord, in all He is for man as
man is a sinner, a mortal, a mourner, a worker.
Do not let Christ be one subject among others.
As little can the sun be one among the planets.
He is the Subject; all others get their reality
and importance for us preachers by their relation
to Him. In particular I venture to say,
do not let occasional, temporal, local topics,
even very important ones, dislodge Christ, the
Lord Jesus Christ of the whole Bible, from
His royal place in your preaching; and do
not forget continually (though not monotonously)
to keep to the front the fact that He is
the sinner's Saviour. More will be said later
about that point of view, but I state it at
once. Speak indeed of Christ as Exemplar,
Ideal, Friend, Man of Men; but do not let
your brethren forget that, "first of all, Christ[Pg&nbsp;263]
died for our sins, according to the
Scriptures," [1 Cor. xv. 3.] and that His primary practical
relation to us is always that of Saviour to
sinner. That truth is not altogether in fashion
now. But it is eternal; it is deep as the
human soul, and as the Law of God, and as
such it is a mighty condition to attractiveness,
wisely and truly handled. It corresponds to
the inmost facts of the hearers' being, whether
they are aware of it yet or not; and is there
not here the most powerful of magnets, at least
in posse?

"PREACH IT EARNESTLY."

ii. "Preach the Gospel earnestly." This does
not mean necessarily with vehemence, or even
with fervour, of manner. Some men's delivery
is fervent, or even vehement, in the most
natural way possible; and let such men preach
so, if they will do it thoughtfully and to the
purpose. But the slightest artificial cultivation
of such qualities, or of the semblance of them,
is a great practical mistake. And earnestness
is at once a wider and a simpler matter all the
while. The man who preaches earnestly is
the man who is altogether in earnest, and
speaks out his conviction and his purpose.[Pg&nbsp;264]

*PREACH IT AS A WITNESS.

He is the man who has the Lord's message
deep in his own soul, and is conscious of its
vast importance for the souls of others. He
is the man who does not merely discuss, or
explain, or even expound, however soundly
and luminously, but whose words&mdash;well chosen,
well weighed, well ordered&mdash;are also the living
words of one who "testifieth that he
hath seen." [Joh. iii. 11.] Yes, the essence of the right sort
of earnestness is the witness-character of the
preacher. What is a witness? One who has
personal knowledge of the matter of his words [2 Tim. i. 12.]mdash;"I
know whom I have believed."
Is there not a great need at this time, in our
dear Church, of more such witness-preaching?
I do not mean preaching that advertises the
preacher as a remarkable Christian, certainly
not preaching that puts for one moment our
"testimony" on a level with the infallible
Word once written. But I do mean the
preaching which, by one of the surest laws of
our nature, attracts attention to that Word in
a living way by the preacher's manifest confession
that its message is a mighty reality and
certainty to himself.[Pg&nbsp;265]

Some years ago I heard an account of the
peculiarly impressive preaching of a young
Mission-clergyman. It was described to me as
remarkable not for energy of manner, or warmth
of diction, but for the impression left on all
hearers that the truths handled by the man
were for himself absolute and present facts.
He stated them with a directness and quietness
which was emphatically matter-of-fact. This
sort of preaching is earnest indeed.

"PREACH IT INTERESTINGLY."

iii. "Preach the Gospel interestingly." How
shall we secure this? Some recipes for interest
are familiar. There is the method of illustration;
there is the method of anecdote: both
excellent, and almost indispensable. Only,
they are methods which have their risks, and
must be used with care. Illustrations are apt
to overwhelm the thing illustrated, the moment
much detail is allowed; and they are apt to
go on three feet, or even upon one, instead
of upon four; and they may be drawn from
quarters too remote to strike the hearers with
effect. Anecdotes have the same risks; and,
besides, they need, if they are to be used
aright, to be carefully sifted and verified. I[Pg&nbsp;266]
say this not to disparage what in some preachers'
hands is a most powerful and also a most
delicate weapon; yet the caution is certainly
needed, especially by younger men.

INTEREST OF EXPLANATION.

But the surest secrets of interesting preaching
lie deeper than anecdote and illustration. One
of them, a very simple one to state, is clearness
of thought, and of the expression and explanation
of thought. I entreat my Brother to be
an explanatory preacher, by which I mean, not
that he should treat his brethren as if they
were his children (unless indeed it is a children's
sermon), but that he should handle
familiar religious terms with the resolve to
make them live and speak to the ordinary
hearer. Nothing is more opiate-like than a
sentence which is unreal to the hearer because
it is mere phraseology. Nothing can be made
more interesting than familiar phraseology (supposing
it to be true and important) so treated
as to speak its meaning out fresh and living in
modern ears.

INTEREST OF EXPOSITION.

Another deep and unfailing secret of interest,
so that it be used intelligently and prayerfully,
is close akin to this last. It lies in the right[Pg&nbsp;267]
sort of expository preaching. I have in my
mind such exposition as will be found in Dr
Vaughan's sermons on the Philippian Epistle.
The charm and power of those sermons lie, I
know, very much in the extraordinary excellence,
the curiosa simplicitas, of their literary
style, so unpretentious and so masterly. But
it lies also in the fact that the preacher takes
us over a familiar Scripture passage, verse by
verse, phrase by phrase, and translates it into
the dialect of present circumstances. Let me
heartily commend this sort of preaching from
my own parochial experience in past days. In
a congregation consisting chiefly of the poor,
I found that the most intelligent and sustained
interest was excited by a series of Sunday
evening sermons on a selected chapter or paragraph,
in which the aim was first to paraphrase
the sacred phrases, as it were, into modern
shapes, and then at the close to enforce some
main message of the portion. The method is as
old as the Homilies of Chrysostom, and older.

INTEREST OF PRACTICALITY.

Another secret of interest, permanent and
effectual, is practicality in preaching. I protest,
whenever I can, and I hope to do so to[Pg&nbsp;268]
the last, against the common but unhappy
fallacy of an outcry against doctrine: "Give
us not a creed, but a life." The whole New
Testament, the whole Bible, protests against
such a sentence. There, a divine creed is
always seen as necessary for a divine life.
Supernatural facts, livingly apprehended, are
necessary for supernatural peace and power in
this formidable natural world. But then, on
the other side, it is a fallacy almost as fatal to
preach the supernatural fact and truth without
a constant and practical application of them to
the crude and stern realities of life. A young
pastoral preacher was once, in my hearing,
warmly and lovingly thanked for his pulpit-work,
on the eve of his quitting his Curacy;
and the point on which his humble friends
dwelt was that he had always preached Christ,
and always showed them how to make use of
His presence and power in the actual circumstances
of their lives. Eloquent words, aye
and true words, spoken in vacuo, will be dull to
most hearers; eternal truths laid alongside the
weekday work and temptation will always be
interesting.[Pg&nbsp;269]

"PREACH THE GOSPEL FULLY."

iv. "Preach the Gospel fully." Here is our
great Nonconformist's last adverb, in his recipe
for attractive preaching. Its point is not so
obvious perhaps as that of the other words,
but it is nobly true. "The Gospel" is, as I
have said, and as we know, nothing less than
Jesus Christ the Lord, in His whole harmonious
glory of Person, Work, and Word.
It is deeply true that in that mighty and
manifold theme there are points which must
be always prominent and ruling; and most
surely the man-humbling and soul-blessing
truths of the Atoning Sacrifice are such points.
"First of all" (we have recalled that
all-significant sentence already), "first of all,
Christ died for our sins." [1 Cor. xv. 3.] Alas for the Church,
for the congregation, for the pulpit, where that
is forgotten, obscured, or put into a secondary,
or perhaps a tertiary place! One thing is
certain; that pulpit cannot be bearing its right
witness meanwhile to the "exceeding
sinfulness" of sin&mdash;not merely the deformity of
sin, but the awful evil and condemnable guilt
of sin [Rom. vii. 13.]. But then it is a thing to be regretted
(and corrected) when the Pastor's preaching is[Pg&nbsp;270]
always and only concerned with the urgent
need, and wonderful provision, for the pardon
and acceptance of the believing sinner. I
dare to say it is impossible that such preaching
should be permanently, or even long,
interesting and attractive, and this because of
the nature of the case.

*PREACH PARDON, BUT MORE ALSO.

Man's fallen and sinful
soul needs pardon unspeakably, and always,
but it needs it as a means to an end; and that
end is nearness to God, conformity to Him,
power to do His blessed will as His servant
for ever. For this same great end the soul
needs, even in the range of truths which are
of the order of means, to learn more than the
glorious rudiments of forgiveness. It needs
to know something of the heavenly Offices
of the once Crucified One: His Mediation,
Suretyship, and Intercession; His Priesthood;
His Royalty; His Headship. In Him lie
stored the divine treasures with which our
whole extent of need is to be met. And the
preacher who would permanently attract his
people, by bringing out of his storehouse things
eternally old and new, must seek and pray to
preach Christ fully.[Pg&nbsp;271]

CHRIST FOR US AND IN US.

To some devoted men it seems impossible
not to be always preaching the glory of "Christ
for us"; others can never leave the precious
theme of "Christ in us." But if they are not
missioners, but pastors, they will assuredly find
that a permanent attraction can only be secured
by doing what the Word of God does&mdash;setting
forth both glorious sets of truths in fulness, in
harmony, and in application to the realities of
sin and of life.

So we have thought awhile about attractive
preaching. Need I say again what the sort
of attractiveness is which I have in view? It
is indeed, on the surface, attraction to the
church, attraction to the sermon; but its whole
inner purpose is an attraction which neither
church nor sermon can in the least degree
cause, but which the Eternal Spirit, sovereign
and loving, can cause through them&mdash;an attraction
to Jesus Christ, in true repentance, living
faith, genuine surrender, and patient, happy
service.



[Pg&nbsp;272]

Ye servants of God, your Master proclaim,
And publish abroad His wonderful Name;
The Name all victorious of Jesus extol,
His kingdom is glorious and rules over all.

"Then let us adore and give Him His right,
All glory and power, all wisdom and might,
All honour and blessing with angels above,
And thanks never ceasing, and infinite love."

C. Wesley.



[Pg&nbsp;273]

CHAPTER XIICONTENTS

PREACHING (iii.).

[Pg&nbsp;274]

Eternal Fulness, overflow to me
Till I, Thy vessel, overflow for Thee;
For sure the streams that make Thy garden grow
Are never fed but by an overflow:
Not till Thy prophets with Thyself run o'er
Are Israel's watercourses full once more.

[Pg&nbsp;275]

Again I treat of the sermon. We have
looked, my younger Brother and I, at
some main secrets and prescriptions for attractive
preaching. What shall I more say on the
subject of the pulpit? In the first place I will
offer a few miscellaneous suggestions, and then
come in closing to the deepest theme of the
whole matter&mdash;Spiritual Power in Preaching.

NOTES FOR A SERMON-LECTURE.

I address myself to write, soon after delivering
to my students, in the library adjoining
my study, a lecture on Preaching. Let me
call it rather, a talk on Sermons, which is a
term less grandiose and much more true; for
in fact the discourse has been a most informal
series of remarks and suggestions on topics
suggested by a collection of sermons written
for me, and which I now came to give back,[Pg&nbsp;276]
annotated, to their writers. It occurs to me
to offer my kind reader a written version of
some of these remarks just made viv&acirc; voce to
my friends. They happen to touch on a
variety of points which are not unimportant in
themselves and also typical of very many more.

For the purposes of the lecture, they have
been divided between matters of form and
matters of substance; and I report them, or
rather some of them, in that order.

I. Remarks on Diction, Style, etc.

(a) Take care to "pull the sentences
together," to avoid loose and redundant phrases
and words. Why write "grief and sorrow,"
"fatigued and tired out," "attacks and
assaults"? A subtle intellect may see distinctions
here, but it is too much for me, and,
I am sure, for most plain people in church.

(b) Respect the Queen's English. "The
one who lives a Christian life" is scarcely
English; say "the man," not "the one."
"Like Adam and Eve walked in Paradise"!
This is a serious, though common, piece of
bad grammar. Say, "Like Adam, when he
walked," but "As Adam walked."[Pg&nbsp;277]

(c) Remember that the genius of English
eschews a large use of connecting words, particularly
in spoken discourse. Not often is a
sentence the better for an "and" at the beginning.
Many a "therefore" and "because" are
well away, if you would speak with freedom
and vigour.

AVOID RHETORICAL DICTION.

(d) Avoid altogether such touches of expression
as characterise verse, or rhetorical prose.
I find in one sermon the sentence, "Think you
St Paul trembled at the prospect?" Please
re-write this, and say, "Do you think St Paul
was afraid?" For you certainly would not
say, speaking however gravely, to your friend,
"Think you that we shall have a fine day to-morrow?"
Rhetorical phrases rarely give an
impression of practical reality.

(e) Do not speak in the pulpit as if you were
writing notes for an edition of the Epistles.
What does the labourer (and what do many
hearers more highly educated than he) think
when you say, on Rom. v. 1, that "weighty
manuscript authority gives another reading"?
And what does he think you mean when you
talk about "She&ocirc;l"? By the way, when you[Pg&nbsp;278]
quote Scripture in the pulpit, passingly, to a
general congregation, I would advise you to
quote not the Revised Version, but the Authorized,
which will surely be "the English Bible"
for many long days yet. Unless you have
before you some special difference between the
two Versions, on which you can stop to speak
explicitly, quote the familiar (and inimitable)
diction of 1611.

PREACH WHAT CAN BE REPORTED.

(f) Prepare your sermon, and preach it, so
that it shall be easy to report. One sermon
here before me would be as hard as possible to
retail at home. It is on Rom. v. 1, and it says
some excellent things upon it. But it brings
in holiness of heart where the text speaks only
of acceptance of person, and it mingles the two
topics so ingeniously together that the impression
is seriously complicated. Think of the
pious daughter yonder in church, going home
to her infirm old mother, and trying to answer
the question, "What did the gentleman preach
about to-night?" Let us do our best to preach
sermons which are not only sound, but portable.

(g) Take care to keep the sermon in tune with the text.
 Here is a manuscript on[Pg&nbsp;279]
Psal. v. 12, a verse of exultant joy; but the
last passage of the sermon, the passage which
ought to concentrate the whole message, is full
of solemn warning. Warn by all means; do
not forget to sound the watchman's
trumpet. But sound it in the right place. [Ezek. xxxiii.]

CUT THE PREFACE SHORT.

(h) Here is a sermon sadly spoiled by a long
introduction. It tells us much about the
circumstances of the inspired writer, but so as
to throw little light on the message of the text.
Here is another, on the wonderfully definite
hope of blessedness after death given us in
Phil. i. 21. This also is ruined by its introduction,
which truly begins ab ovo, discussing
the genesis of man's belief in immortality!
That preface would leave, in the actual delivery
of the sermon, about five minutes for the
handling of the precious words, "To depart
and to be with Christ, which is far better."
Generally, be shy of much introduction and
preface in the pulpit. I do not mean that we
are never to elucidate connexions and contexts.
But, remember limits. Your minutes
are few, ah, so few, for such a Message,&mdash;Christ
Jesus in His fulness, for man's need in[Pg&nbsp;280]
its depth. Pass quickly through the porch into
that Church.

BE ACCURATE IN STATEMENT.

(i) When you refer to Scripture facts, be
accurate; a slip-shod habit there may fatally
prejudice a not quite friendly hearer who knows
something of the Bible; and it will certainly do
no good to any hearer. Here is a sermon on
Phil. i. 21, and it speaks of St Paul as writing
to Philippi from his "dark cell." But St Luke
says that he was "in his own hired
house," [Acts xxviii. 30.] or at worst, "his own hired rooms."
Here again I read of David as returning to
"Jerusalem, the city of his fathers." But his
fathers had lived and died at Bethlehem; and
Jerusalem was in heathen hands till David
himself took it!

2. Remarks on Points in the Substance of the
Sermons.

(a) Are you quite sure that the Patriarchs
had no anticipation of a life eternal? Many
lecturers, and many editors, now say so. But
the Epistle to the Hebrews says that "they
desired a better country, that is an
heavenly" [Heb. xi. 16.]; and that is better evidence for this
purpose than any inferences (or beliefs) of[Pg&nbsp;281]
modern "scholarship." True, the old saints
say little explicitly about their hope. But
many things lie deep in a man's faith, and in
his experience too, about which, for various
reasons, he may say very little.

REVELATION WAS NOT INTUITION.

(b) I do not like this sentence, which says
that the later Prophets had a "fuller perception
of" the eternal future than their predecessors.
Not that I blame the phrase in itself; but I
dislike its associations. There runs a strong
drift in modern theology, as we all know,
towards the explanation of Scripture by "perception"
rather than by revelation. "The
Lord appeared unto me"; "The Lord spake
unto me"; say the Prophets, and they appeal
occasionally to supernatural attestation of their
assertions. But the modern expository savant,
wiser to be sure than the Prophet, assures us
that they arrived at their messages by observation,
by meditation, by development of thought
and character, and practically by nothing different
from these things. Accordingly, their
"inspiration" was strictly speaking the same
in kind as that of a Chrysostom, or a Luther,
or a Shakespeare. Do not you say so, or[Pg&nbsp;282]
imply that it is so. Do not go for mere
company's sake with the current of naturalistic
thought. Sure I am that you are most unlikely,
if you do, to be the instrument of
supernatural effects in your preaching.

"WHAT IS JUSTIFICATION?"

(c) "What is Justification? It is, the making
man just." Is it indeed? I should read that
sentence with alarm, if I did not know the
writer! Its sentiment is practically Roman
Catholic. Moreover, it puts a meaning on the
word in question, contradicted by the common
usages of language; an important consideration
when we study a Scriptural theological term.
When I "justify my opinion" I do not make
it right, but vindicate it as already right.
When the Hebrew judge "justified the righteous,"
[Deut. xxv. 1] he did not improve him, but
pronounced him satisfactory to the law. And
when God, for Christ's sake, justifies you who
believe in Jesus, He does not in that act make
you good; He pronounces you, for His Son's
sake, to be satisfactory to His Law, for
purposes of your personal acceptance.

"WHY DOES FAITH JUSTIFY?"

(d) "Why has faith such power to justify?
Because, carried out to its fullest extent, it im[Pg&nbsp;283]plies
assimilation to its Object." Here again
I should be alarmed, if I did not know the
writer's general convictions, which are sound
enough. But this particular sentence again is
in full harmony with Romanist doctrine. And,
as a fact, with the Bible open, and with usages
of common language before us, it can easily be
exposed as a confusion of words and thought.
Faith, carried out ever so fully, is just faith
still; personal reliance, personal confidence on
God in His Word. That reliance is His
appointed (and divinely natural) way for our
reception of Jesus Christ. For our Justification,
it receives Christ in His merits; it does that,
and that only, and always. For our Sanctification,
it receives Christ in His inward power,
by the Holy Ghost. But faith is just faith, to
the end.

(e) "We are not forced to receive salvation."
Most true. "He enforceth not the will." But
do not forget on the other hand to magnify the
necessity of grace, "preventing grace," [Act. x.]
that is to say, God Himself "working in us to
will" [Phil. ii. 13.] to receive our salvation. The
two sides of truth are both divine. Do not[Pg&nbsp;284]
neglect either, whether you can harmonize them
or not here below.



END OF THE LECTURE.

Such are some specimens of a Saturday
morning's talk in our library. They are taken,
just as they come, from notes constructed after
the study of a set of some twenty sermons,
written, and then commented upon, without the
slightest thought that any public or permanent
use would be made of the materials thus given.
But perhaps the remarks may be in point to
some of my readers all the more because of the
unstudied nature of the materials.

Let me say, before I quite leave this part of
my subject, that adverse criticism was by no
means my only work this morning in the
lecture-room. It was my happiness, on the
other hand, to commend thankfully many a
clear setting of living truth, and many a sentence
of forcible point and of true beauty,
happy omens for future years, in which, if it
please God, "the torch shall be carried on,"
bright and clear, when we elders shall be heard
no more.[34]

[34] Ungracious as it may seem, I must betray one less pleasant
confidence of such occasions. Sometimes I have had to note
in sermon MSS. a strange neglect of punctuation, and, here and
there, a little aberration from received usages of spelling! No
Clergyman ought to think such matters beneath his notice. His
people, some, if not many of them, will from time to time receive
letters or other written messages from him; these ought to be
unmistakably the writing of the educated gentleman. Is it too
much to say also that the handwriting ought to be clear and
easy? It is distressing, certainly to one who has many letters
to read daily, to see how rare such handwriting is now.[Pg&nbsp;285]

"MY CASES OF OLD SERMONS."

But now let me return from this discursive
report of a sermon-lecture to some more
central thoughts about the Preaching of the
Word. Sacred, solemn theme! I was made
to realize its character in a peculiar way quite
lately, when reading a heart-searching and
most instructive essay, by the Rev. R. Glover,
Vicar of St Luke's, West Holloway, entitled,
My Cases of Old Sermons.[35] The essay was
simply an experienced preacher's review of
many years of pulpit labour, in the light of the
collected and ordered manuscripts which silently
represented it. The writer had much to say,
to my great profit, about his methods of preparation
and delivery, and about the pains
taken to distribute the choice of texts widely
and impartially over the field of Scripture.[Pg&nbsp;286]
Then he went on to speak of the ascertained
spiritual history of some of those many sermons;
the messages to souls which in this or that
instance they had carried; the savour of life
unto life, or perhaps, alas, of death unto death,
which had to his knowledge breathed from
them. The impressions left on my mind were,
above all others, two; first, the call to thorough
diligence in preparation, if the preacher is to
give his account with joy; and then, the indescribable
solemnity and greatness of the
work of a true pastor-preacher.

[35] In The Churchman of August, 1891.

*BE A PREACHER INDEED.

I may seem
to reiterate too much, but I must say again,
with new emphasis, to my younger Brother,
resolve to be a preacher indeed, by the grace
of God. Do not let secondary things, however
good, distort your attention from that
supremely sacred commission, "Preach the
Word; be instant, in season, out of
season[36] [2 Tim. iv. 2.]; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering
and doctrine. For," the Apostle
significantly proceeds, "the time will come
when they will not endure sound doctrine."[Pg&nbsp;287]
Therefore, an age impatient of thorough Scriptural
preaching is the very age in which to
seek, in wisdom and courage, to make much of
it. Do not let organization spoil your preaching-work.
Do not let current events spoil it.
Do not let elaboration of ritual spoil it. Do
not let organist and choir rule over you, and
claim for music the precious moments called for
by the Word.

[36] That is, irrespective of your own convenience.



"THE DIRECTORY."

Let me present to my reader, in this last
chapter, an extract from an old book which
however may be new to him. The book is
not one which as a whole I greatly love; how
could I? It is that sternly-imposed substitute
for the Book of Common Prayer, commonly
known as the Parliamentary Directory of 1645;
the exact title is, A Directory for the Publique
Worship of God in the Three Kingdomes.[37] Its
associations are altogether with an unhappy
time, in which it was a seriously penal offence, at
least in theory, to use the Prayer Book even at
a sick friend's bedside. Yet great men of God[Pg&nbsp;288]
had a hand in the making of the Directory;
and their words are well worth the reading.
In particular, I find in the volume one passage,
full of golden wisdom, a precious message to
all Christian preachers. It is the section which
I now quote exactly as it first appeared, and
which is entitled

[37] It is printed in W.K. Clay's Book of Common Prayer Illustrated.
Parker, 1841.

"Of the Preaching of the Word.

*THE DIRECTORY ON PREACHING.

"Preaching of the Word, being the power
of God unto Salvation, and one of the greatest
and most excellent Works belonging to the
Ministry of the Gospell, should bee so performed,
that the Workman need not bee
ashamed, but may save himself, and those that
heare him.

"It is presupposed (according to the Rules
for Ordination) that the Minister of Christ is in
some good measure gifted for so weighty a
service, by his skill in the Originall Languages,
and in such Arts and Sciences as are handmaids
unto Divinity, by his knowledge in the
whole Body of Theology, but most of all in the
holy Scriptures, having his senses and heart
exercised in them above the common sort of[Pg&nbsp;289]
Beleevers; and by the illumination of Gods
Spirit, and other gifts of edification, which
(together with reading and studying of the
Word) he ought still to seek by Prayer, and
an humble heart, resolving to admit and receive
any truth not yet attained, when ever God shall
make it known unto him. All which hee is to
make use of, and improve, in his private preparations,
before hee deliver in publike what he
hath provided.

CHOICE OF THE TEXT.

"Ordinarily, the subject of his Sermon is to
be some Text of Scripture, holding forth some
principle or head of Religion; or suitable to
some speciall occasion emergent; or hee may
goe on in some Chapter, Psalme, or Booke of
the holy Scripture, as hee shall see fit.

"Let the Introduction to his Text be brief
and perspicuous, drawn from the Text itself,
or context, or some parallel place, or generall
sentence of Scripture.

"If the Text be long (as in Histories and
Parables it sometimes must be) let him give a
briefe summe of it; if short, a Paraphrase
thereof, if need be: In both, looking diligently
to the scope of the Text, and pointing at the[Pg&nbsp;290]
chief heads and grounds of Doctrine, which he
is to raise from it.

HOW THE TEXT IS TO BE HANDLED.

"In Analysing and dividing his Text, he is
to regard more the order of matter, then of
words; and neither to burden the memory of
the hearers in the beginning with too many
members of Division, nor to trouble their
minds with obscure terms of Art.

"In raising Doctrines from the Text, his
care ought to bee, First, that the matter be the
truth of God. Secondly, that it be a truth
contained in or grounded on that Text, that the
hearers may discern how God teacheth it from
thence. Thirdly, that he chiefly insist upon
those Doctrines which are principally intended,
and make most for the edification of the
hearers.

"The Doctrine is to be expressed in plaine
termes; or if any thing in it need explication,
is to bee opened, and the consequence also
from the Text cleared. The parallel places of
Scripture confirming the Doctrine are rather to
bee plaine and pertinent, then many, and (if
need bee) somewhat insisted upon, and applyed
to the purpose in hand.[Pg&nbsp;291]

"The Arguments or Reasons are to bee
solid; and, as much as may bee, convincing.
The illustrations, of what kind soever, ought to
bee full of light, and such as may convey the
truth into the Hearers heart with spirituall
delight.

"If any doubt, obvious from Scripture,
Reason, or Prejudice of the Hearers, seem to
arise, it is very requisite to remove it, by reconciling
the seeming differences, answering the
reasons, and discovering and taking away the
causes of prejudice and mistake. Otherwise,
it is not fit to detain the hearers with propounding
or answering vaine or wicked Cavils,
which as they are endlesse, so the propounding
and answering of them doth more hinder than
promote edification.

"Hee is not to rest in generall Doctrine,
although never so much cleared and confirmed,
but to bring it home to speciall use, by application
to his hearers: Which albeit it prove a
worke of great difficulty to himselfe, requiring
much prudence, zeale, and meditation, and to
the naturall and corrupt man will bee very unpleasant;
yet hee is to endeavour to perform it[Pg&nbsp;292]
in such a manner that his auditors may feele
the Word of God to be quick and powerfull,
and a discerner of the thoughts and intents
of the heart; and that if any unbeleever or
ignorant person bee present, hee may have the
secrets of his heart made manifest, and give
glory to God.

HOW THE MESSAGE IS TO BE APPLIED.

"In the Use of Instruction or information in
the knowledge of some truth, which is a consequence
from his Doctrine, he may (when
convenient) confirm it by a few firm arguments
from the Text in hand, and other places in
Scripture, or from the nature of that Common
place in Divinity, whereof that truth is a
branch.

"In Confutation of false Doctrines, he is
neither to raise an old Heresie from the grave,
nor to mention a blasphemous opinion unnecessarily;
but if the people be in danger of
an errour, he is to confute it soundly, and
endeavour to satisfie their judgements and
consciences against all objections.

"In exhorting to Duties, he is, as he seeth
cause, to teach also the meanes that help to the
performance of them.[Pg&nbsp;293]

"In Dehortation, Reprehension, and publique
Admonition (which require speciall wisdome)
let him, as there shall be cause, not only
discover the nature and greatnesse of the sin,
with the misery attending it, but also shew the
danger his hearers are in to be overtaken and
surprised by it, together with the remedies and
best way to avoyd it.

"In applying Comfort, whether generall
against all tentations, or particular against
some speciall troubles or terrours, he is carefully
to answer such objections, as a troubled
heart and afflicted spirit may suggest to the
contrary.

"It is also sometimes requisite to give some
Notes of tryal (which is very profitable, especially
when performed by able and experienced
Ministers, with circumspection and prudence,
and the Signes cleerely grounded on the Holy
Scripture) whereby the Hearers may be able
to examine themselves, whether they have
attained those Graces, and performed those
duties to which he Exhorteth, or be guilty of
the sin Reprehended, and in danger of the
judgments Threatened, or are such to whom[Pg&nbsp;294]
the Consolations propounded doe belong; that
accordingly they may be quickened and excited
to Duty, humbled for their Wants and Sins,
affected with their Danger, and strengthened
with Comfort, as their condition upon examination
shall require.

"And, as he needeth not alwayes to prosecute
every Doctrine which lies in his Text, so
is he wisely to make choice of such Uses, as
by his residence and conversing with his flocke,
he findeth most needfull and seasonable: and,
amongst these, such as may most draw their
soules to Christ, the Fountaine of light, holinesse
and comfort.

"This method is not prescribed as necessary
for every man, or upon every Text; but only
recommended, as being found by experience
to be very much blessed of God, and very
helpful for the people's understandings and
memories.

IN WHAT SPIRIT THE PREACHER IS TO WORK.

"But the Servant of Christ, whatever his
Method be, is to perform his whole Ministery;

"1. Painfully, not doing the work of the
Lord negligently.

"2. Plainly, that the meanest may under[Pg&nbsp;295]stand,
delivering the truth, not in the entising
words of mans wisdome, but in demonstration
of the Spirit and of power, least the Crosse of
Christ should be made of none effect: abstaining
also from an unprofitable use of unknown
Tongues, strange phrases, and cadences of
sounds and words, sparingly citing sentences
of Ecclesiasticall, or other humane Writers,
ancient or moderne, be they never so elegant.

"3. Faithfully, looking at the honour of
Christ, the conversion, edification and salvation
of the people, not at his own gains or glory:
keeping nothing back which may promote
those holy ends, giving to every one his own
portion, and bearing indifferent respect unto
all, without neglecting the meanest, or sparing
the greatest in their sins.

"4. Wisely, framing all his Doctrines, Exhortations,
and especially his Reproofs, in such
a manner as may be most likely to prevaile,
shewing all due respect to each mans person
and place, and not mixing his own passion or
bitternesse.

"5. Gravely, as becometh the Word of God,[Pg&nbsp;296]
shunning all such gesture, voice and expressions
as may occasion the corruptions of men to
despise him and his Ministry.

"6. With loving affection, that the people
may see all coming from his Godly zeale, and
hearty desire to doe them good. And

DOCTRINE AND LIFE.

"7. As taught of God, and perswaded in his
own heart, that all that he teacheth, is the
truth of Christ; and walking before his flock
as an example to them in it; earnestly, both in
private and publique, recommending his labours
to the blessing of God, and watchfully looking
to himselfe and the flock whereof the Lord
hath made him overseer. So shall the Doctrine
of truth be preserved uncorrupt, many soules
converted, and built up, and himselfe receive
manifold comforts of his labours even in this
life, and afterward the Crown of Glory laid up
for him in the world to come.

"Where there are more Ministers in a
Congregation than one, and they of different
guifts, each may more especially apply himselfe
to Doctrine or Exhortation, according to the
guift wherein he most excelleth, and as they
agree between themselves."[Pg&nbsp;297]

SPIRITUAL POWER IN PREACHING.

I have little to say after the recitation of
this passage of pregnant and solemn counsel.
That little shall be given to a supreme aspect
of the whole subject; I mean, Spiritual Power
in Preaching. Who that knows the Lord, and
contemplates the preacher's work, does not
long for Spiritual Power? By that longing he
means no ambitious wish to be remarkable, nor
any unwholesome craving to be a leader in
scenes of religious excitement. He means the
deep desire to be an effectual messenger of his
Master; to be the living channel of the Holy
Spirit's energy in His converting, sanctifying,
strengthening, perfecting work. He knows
that it is possible to be truly orthodox, and yet
not to be this; to be eloquent, to be impressive,
to be impassioned, and yet not to be this; to
be unimpeachably truthful, reasonable, intellectually
convincing, and yet all the while not
to be this. How shall he be a vehicle of
spiritual power?

THE OPEN SECRET.

The Scriptural answer is very simple, but
it goes deep. If a man would have spiritual
power with men, and prevail, he must be real
with his Lord. What he says, he must first[Pg&nbsp;298]
know, he must first live. As regards Him
who is at once his Master and his Gospel, he
must indeed "know whom he has"If a man
believed," [2 Tim. i. 10.] and, in calm but entire simplicity,
"submit himself under His hands." Granted
a true creed, and a humble faith in its Subject,
he must, in quiet reality, "yield himself unto
God," if he would be used by Him. Observe
the Apostle's phrase; "Yield yourselves,"
&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8053;&#963;&#945;&#964;&#949; &#7953;&#945;&#965;&#964;&#959;&#8059;&#962;: not, "yield to
God" (though that is implied), but, "yield
yourselves, hand yourselves over, to God," as
you would hand over a tool, a weapon [Rom. vi. 13.]. And
another aspect of the same thing appears in
the same Apostle's later words:
purge himself of these, he shall be a
vessel unto honour, sanctified (to), and meet
for, the Master's use," &#7969;&#947;&#953;&#945;&#963;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#957; &#949;&#8020;&#967;&#961;&#951;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#957;
&#964;&#8183; &#916;&#949;&#963;&#960;&#8057;&#964;&#8131;. [2 Tim. ii. 21.]

The deepest secret of spiritual power, in
God's sense of the phrase, lies there. Let the
man be watchful over his Scriptural creed, and
let him discipline his life, and let him toil in his
study, and among his people. None of these
things can be spared; they are all vital. But[Pg&nbsp;299]
the central secret, which they as it were enclose
and protect, lies in the words Surrender in
faith. And the Christian man's heart must be
its own inquisitor, before God, in the inquiry
after the point, or points, where you, where I,
need to make that surrender for ourselves.

In the void thus left, in the chasm thus cut
deep into our ambitions, into our self-love, the
mighty Spirit in His tranquil fulness will spring
up. And then, whether we know it or not,
we Ministers of the Word shall assuredly be
vehicles of spiritual power, to our Lord's praise.



FAREWELL.

So let me close these fragmentary words
spoken "to my younger Brethren." May
God's mercy be upon the writer. Upon the
readers, whom he loves in the Lord, may
grace and peace come every hour and day, in
secret, in society, in holy ministration of Word
and Ordinance. And in due time, when they
are no longer juniors but, if the Lord will,
veterans and leaders in the work, may they in
turn pass on the message to those who follow,
in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.[Pg&nbsp;300]

"Christianity is so great and surprising in its nature
that, in preaching it to others, I have no encouragement
but in the belief of a continued divine operation. It is no
difficult thing to change a man's opinions. It is no difficult
thing to attach a man to my person and notions. It is no
difficult thing to convert a proud man to spiritual pride,
or a passionate man to passionate zeal for some religious
party. But to bring a man to love God, to love the law of
God while it condemns him, to loathe himself before God,
to tread the earth under his feet, to hunger and thirst after
God in Christ, and after the mind that was in Christ, this
is impossible. But God has said it shall be done; and
bids me go forth and preach, that by me, as His instrument,
He may effect these great ends; and therefore I go."

Cecil.

FORDINGTON PULPIT:CONTENTS

A PREACHER'S WEEKDAY THOUGHTS,

Written, in 1878, in the Church of the Author's Baptism, and
where he first Ministered as his Father's Curate.

Many voices yester-even
Made these walls and arches ring
With their high-sung hopes of Heaven,
And the glories of its King;
Now my footfall sounds alone
On the aisle's long path of stone,
Save that yonder from the loft,
With a solemn tone and soft,
Beating on with muffled shock,
Conscience-waking, speaks the clock.
Holy scene, and dear as holy,
Let me ponder thee this hour,
Not in aimless melancholy,
But in quest of Heaven-given power;
Seeking here to win anew
Contrite love and purpose true;
Near the Font whose dew-drops cold
Fell upon my brow of old,
Near the well-remember'd seat
Set beside my Mother's feet;[Pg&nbsp;302]
Near the Table where I bent
At that earliest Sacrament.
Let me, through this narrow door,
Climb the Pulpit's steps once more.
Blessed place! the Master's Word,
Child and man, I hence have heard;
Awful place! for hence, in turn,
I have taught, so slow to learn.
To the silence now to hearken
Here I mount and stand alone,
While the spaces round me darken
And the Church is all my own;
While the sun's last glories fall
From the window of the tower,
Tracing slow their parting hour
On the stones of floor and wall.
Seems a secret Voice to thrill
All the dusky air so still;
Turns a soul-compelling gaze
On me from the sunset haze:
Sure the eternal Shepherd's hand
Beckons me awhile apart,
Bids me in His presence stand
While He looks me through the heart.
Sinful preacher, ask again
In this nearness of thy Lord,
How to Him has rung thy strain,
When it seem'd to speak His Word.
'Midst thy brethren's listening numbers
Hast thou felt, with heart sincere,
How, in thought that never slumbers,
This great Listener stood more near?&mdash;[Pg&nbsp;303]
Listening to His own high Name
Spoken by His creature's breath;
How from out the Heavens He came,
How He pour'd His soul in death,
How He triumph'd o'er the grave,
How He lives on high to save,
How He yet again shall come,
Lord of glory and of doom.
Has He found thy message true?
Truth, and truly spoken too?
Utter'd with a purpose whole,
From a self-forgetful soul,
Bent on nothing save the fame
Of the dear redeeming Name,
And the pardon, life, and bliss
Of the souls He bought for His?
Think!&mdash;But ah, from thoughts like these
Hasten, sinner, to thy knees.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
