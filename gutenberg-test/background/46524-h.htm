Whilest I abode (right Honorable)
in the Isle of Palma, in affaires of
merchandize for the vvorshipfull
<em class="italic">Thomas Locke</em> deceased, and his company,
time then permitted me, to
haue cōference vvith auncient gentlemen
vvhiche had serued in the Conquest of the
vveft India, novve called nevve Spaine, vnder the
princely Captaine <em class="italic">Hernando Cortez</em>. By vvhom as present
vvitnesses at many of the actes herein contayned,
I vvas credibly informed, that this delectable
and vvorthy Historie is a most true and iust reporte
of matter paste in effect: vvherefore I did the more
vvillingly turne ouer and peruse the same, vvhiche
is a Mirrour and an excellent president, for all such
as shall take in hande to gouerne nevve Discoueries:
for here they shall behold, hovv Glorie, Renovvne,
and perfite Felicitie, is not gotten but vvith greate
paines, trauaile, perill and daunger of life: here shall
they see the vvisedome, curtesie, valour and pollicie
of vvorthy Captaynes, yea and the faithfull hartes
vvhiche they ought to beare vnto their Princes seruice:
here also is described, hovv to vse and correct
the stubbern &#38; mutinous persons, &#38; in vvhat order
to exalt the good, stoute and vertuous Souldiers, and
chiefly, hovv to preserue and keepe that bevvtifull
Dame <em class="italic">Lady Victorie</em> vvhē she is obtayned. And vvhere
it vvas supposed, that the golden mettall had his beginning
and place in the East and VVeast <em class="italic">India</em>, neare
vnto the hote Zoane, (as moste learned vvriters
helde opinion) it is novve approued by the venterous
trauellour and vvorthy captaine <em class="italic">Martin Frobisher</em>
Esquire, yea and also through the greate paynes,
procurement, and firste inuention of the vvorshipfull
<em class="italic">Mychaell Locke</em> Merchaunt, that the same golden
mettall dothe also lie incorporate in the bovvelles
of the Norvveast parties, enuironned vvith admirable
Tovvers, Pillers and Pynacles, of Rockes, Stone,
and Ise, possessed of a people bothe straunge, &#38; rare
in shape, attire and lyuing, yea suche a Countrey
and people, as all <em class="italic">Europe</em> had forsaken and made no
account of, excepte our moste gratious Queene and
her subiectes, vvhome vndoubtedly God hath appoynted,
not onely to be supreme Princesse ouer
them, but also to be a meane that the name of Christ
maybe knovven vnto this Heathenish and Sauage
generation.</p>

<p>Not long since (right Honorable) I happened to
trauayle from the famous Cittie of <em class="italic">Tolledo</em> in <em class="italic">Spayne</em>,
tovvarde highe <em class="italic">Castile</em>, and by fortune ouertooke an
auncient Gentlemen, vvorshipfully accompanied,
vnto vvhō I vvas so bold as to approch, beseching his
vvorship to aduertise me of his iourney: vvho (after
he had beheld my white head &#38; beard) ansvvered ful
gentlely, that his intēt vvas to trauayle vnto the king
of Spaynes Court, and vvelcomed me vnto his company.
In shorte space that vve had iourneyed togither,
and communed of each other his Countrey, it
pleased him to say as follovveth: My good friende,
if you knevv my sute vnto the Kings maiestie, you
vvould iudge that I vvere a mad man, and therefore
to shorten oure vvay, I vvill declare my attempted
sute vnto you. You shall vnderstande, that I am a
Gentleman of lxx. yeares of age, and sometimes I
serued in the ciuill vvarres of <em class="italic">Pirru</em>, vvhere I vvas
vvounded in diuers parts of my body, and am novv
thereby lame in one of my legges and shoulder. I
haue neyther VVife nor childe, and at this presente
(God be praised) I haue in the Contractation house
in the Citie of <em class="italic">Siuill</em>, in golde and plate, the summe
of thirtie thousande Duckates: and I haue also in
<em class="italic">Pirru</em> in good lands and possessions, the yearely rente
of tvvelue thousande Duckates, vvhiche rentes and
readye money is sufficiente to mainteyne a poore
Gentleman. But al this notvvithstanding, I do novv
sue vnto the Kings Maiestie, to haue licence and
authoritie to discouer and conquere a certayne parte
of <em class="italic">India</em>, vvhyche adioyneth vvith <em class="italic">Brazile</em>, and is part
of the Empire of <em class="italic">Pirru</em>, I pray you novve declare
what you thinke of my sute. By my troth sir (quoth
I) I trust your vvorship vvill pardon a rash and suddaine
iudgemēt, which you now demand at my hād:
yea truly (quoth he) say vvhat you list. Then (quoth
I) my opiniō is, that you are not wel in your wit, for
vvhat vvould you haue? vvil not reason suffice you?
or else would you now in your old days be an Emperour,
considering that your Sepulchre attendeth for you.
Novve truly I thanke you (quoth he) for of youre
iudgement are most men: but I say vnto you, considering
that all flesh must finish, I seeke for no quiet
rest in this transitorie life: yea the vvise and Christian
Doctors do teach and admonish, that euery true
Christian is borne, not for his ovvne priuate vvealth
and pleasure, but rather to help and succoure others
his poore breethren. Likevvise doe I consider the
greate number of Gentlemen, yonger brethren, and
other valiāt persons, vvho through vvant of liuing,
do fall into many disorders. VVherefore to accomplish
my dutie tovvard God and my Prince, and to
releeue such poore Gentlemen, do I novv attempte
this iourney, vvith the aduenture of my bodye and
goodes, and for that purpose I haue in readinesse
foure tall Shippes, vvell furnished in the porte of
<em class="italic">Saint Lucar de Barrameda</em>, hoping assuredlye, that before
the life depart from my body, to heare these valiante
yong Gentlemen (vvhome novv I meane to haue in
my company) say, oh happie day, vvhen olde <em class="italic">Zarate</em>
(for so is my name) broughte vs from penurie, yea
and from a number of perils that vve vvere like to
fall into. I hope also, that the royall estate of my
Prince shall be by my paynes and poore seruice enlarged:
beleeue you me, this is the onely sumptuous
Tumbe that I pretende to builde for my poore carkas.
But yet I knovv there are some, vnto vvhome
I may compare the Bore that lyeth vvallovvyng
in his Stye, vvho vvill not lette to saye, vvhat neede
vve any other vvorld, honor, or Kingdomes? let vs
be contented vvith that vve haue: vvho may easily
be aunsvvered, Sir glutton, your paunch is full, and
little care you for the glory of God, honor of youre
Prince, neyther the neede and necessitie of youre
poore neyboures. VVith this conclusion the Gentleman
ended his tale, the iudgement vvhereof I leaue
to noble Gentlemen his peeres to be determined.</p>

<p>And vvhere oure Captayne <em class="italic">Hernando Cortez</em>, of
vvhose valiant actes this historie treateth, hathe deserued
immortal fame, euē so doubtlesse I hope, that
vvithin this happie Realme is novv liuing a Gentleman,
vvose zeale of trauayle and valiant beginnings
dothe prognosticate greate, maruellous, and
happie successe: for perfection of honor and profite
is not gotten in one daye, nor in one or tvvo voyages,
as the true histories of the East and VVest Conquests
by Spanyardes and Portingalles do testifye.
And calling to remembrance the greate zeale and
good vvill vvhich your honor hath alvvayes extended
to good and profitable attemptes, and especially
in the proceedings of the nevv discouery, youre honor
hath not only vsed liberalitie in your aduētures,
but also taken greate paynes in Courte, to aduance
and further the voyage, a number I saye of Gentlemen,
Marriners, and other artificers, shal haue great
cause to pray for your honor. And vvhere I for my
parte haue tasted of your honors goodnesse sundrye
vvayes, I am novve most humbly to beseech youre
honor to accept this poore gifte, the vvhiche I haue
translated out of the Spanish tong, not decked vvith
gallant couloures, nor yet fyled vvith pleasant phrase
of Rhetorike, for these things are not for poore
Marchant trauellers, but are reserued to learned
VVriters: yet I trust the Author vvill pardon mee,
bycause I haue gone as neere the sense of this Historie,
as my cunning vvoulde reach vnto. I also craue,
that it may please youre honor, vvhen your greate
and vvaightie businesse vvill permitte, to beholde
this vvorke, and that shall be for me an encouragemente
to take in hande the translation of the East
<em class="italic">India</em>, vvhiche is novve enioyed by the King of
Portingall. Thus I ende, beseeching
the Almighty to preserue your
honorable estate.</p>

In the yeare of our Sauiour,
1485. being kings of <em class="italic">Castill</em> and
<em class="italic">Aragon</em>, the Catholike princes
<em class="italic">Fernando</em> and <em class="italic">Isabell</em> his wyfe,
was borne <em class="italic">Hernando Cortez</em> in
a towne called <em class="italic">Medellin</em>, situated
in the prouince of <em class="italic">Andulozia</em>:
his Father was named
<em class="italic">Martyn Cortez de Monroy</em>, &#38; his
mother was called Lady <em class="italic">Katherin Pisarro Altamirano</em>, they
were bothe of good byrth, and procéeded from foure principall
houses, that is to say, the house of <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, the house
of <em class="italic">Monroy</em>, the house of <em class="italic">Pisarro</em>, and the house of <em class="italic">Altamirano</em>,
which foure houses are auncient, noble and honorable:
yet these parents but poore in goods, but riche in vertue &#38;
good life, for whiche cause they were muche estéemed and
beloued among theyr neighbours. His mother was of
inclination deuoute, but somewhat harde: his father was
charitable and mercyfull, who in his youth applied himselfe
to the warres, and was Liuetenant to a company of
horsemen. <em class="italic">Hernando Cortez</em> in his childehood was very
sickely, so that many tymes he was at the poynt of death:
And when he came to .xiiii. yéeres of age, his parents sent
him to the Vniuersitie of <em class="italic">Salamanca</em>, where he remayned
twoo yeares, learnyng Grammar, and then returned to
<em class="italic">Medellin</em> werie of his studie, yea possible for want of money:
yet his parēts were much offended with him for leauing
his studie, for theyr onely desire was to haue had
him a student at lawe, whiche is a facultie both riche and
worshipfull, consideryng their sonne to be of a good witte
and abilitie: Yet he caused muche strife in his Fathers
house, for he was a very vnhappy ladde, high minded, and
a louer of chiualrie, for which cause he determined with
himselfe to wander abroad to séeke aduentures. And at
that instant happened two iorneys fit for his purpose &#38;
inclination. The one of them was to <em class="italic">Naples</em> wyth
<em class="italic">Gonsalo Hernandez</em> of the Citie of <em class="italic">Cordoua</em>, who was a
worthy man, &#38; named the great captaine. And the other
iourney was to the Weast India, with the Lorde <em class="italic">Nicholas
de Ouando</em>, a knight of the order of <em class="italic">Larez</em>, who was
then appointed for gouernour of those parties. And musing
with himselfe which waye to take, determined to
passe into <em class="italic">India</em>, chiefly bycause the gouernour was of
his acquaintance, and such a one as would haue care of
him. And likewise the great desire of gold made him to
couet that voyage more than the Iorney vnto <em class="italic">Naples</em>.
Now in the meane while that y<sup>e</sup> fleet was preparing for
<em class="italic">India</em>, it chaunced, <em class="italic">Hernando Cartez</em> pretended to go vnto
a certaine house in the night season to talke with a woman,
and clyming ouer a Wall whyche was of weake
foundation, both he and the Wal fell togither: So that
with the noyse of hys fall, and ratling of his armoure
which he ware, came out a man newly married, and findyng
him fallen at hys dore would haue slayne hym, suspecting
somewhat of his newe married wife, but that
a certaine olde woman (being his mother in lawe) wyth
great perswasions stayed him from that fact. Yet with
the fall he fell into a grieuous Ague, and continued sicke
for a long season, so that he could not procéede vppon his
voyage with the gouernour <em class="italic">Ouando</em>. And when he had
obtained and fullye recouered his health, he mynded to
passe into <em class="italic">Italy</em>, And so toke hys way towarde <em class="italic">Valentia</em>,
wandering here and there almoste a whole yeare wyth
much necessitye and penurie, and then returned home againe
to <em class="italic">Medellyn</em>, with determination to procéed vppon
his pretended voyage of <em class="italic">India</em>: Wherevppon hys
father and mother waying their sonnes estate, desired
God to blesse hym, and gaue him money in his purse for
his iorney.</p>

<em class="italic">Hernando Cortez</em> was of the age of
nintéene yeares, in the yeare of
Christ 1504. and then he went toward
<em class="italic">India</em>, and agréed for his passage
and victual with <em class="italic">Alonso Quintezo</em>
who went in companie of other
four shippes laden with merchandise,
whiche nauie departed
from saint <em class="italic">Lucas de Barramedo</em>, with prosperous nauigation,
vntyll they arriued at the Iland of <em class="italic">Gomera</em> one of the
<em class="italic">Canarie</em> Ilands, where they did prouide themselues of all
things necessarie for so long a voyage as they then had
in hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Comfort of God.</div>

<p><em class="italic">Alounso Quintezo</em>, being greedie of his voyage, and desirous
to come to the Ilande of <em class="italic">Sainto Domingo</em> before his
fellowes, hoping to sel his commoditie the better, departed
from <em class="italic">Gomera</em> in the night season without knowledge
giuing vnto his company. But incontinent after he had
hoysed vp his sayles, arose vp so great a winde and tempest,
that his maine mast brake, whereby hee was forced
to retourne backe againe to the Ilande of <em class="italic">Gomera</em>. And
he made earnest requeste to them of the other shyppes
to staye for him, vntyl hee hadde mended his Mast,
who friendlye and neyghbourlye graunted hys desire,
and departed altogither, sayling in sight the one of the
other certayne dayes: yet the sayde <em class="italic">Quintero</em>, seyng the
weather stedfast, and harpyng vpon gaynes, flewe from
his fellowes agayne. And where as <em class="italic">Frances Ninio de
Guelua</em> his pilote was not experte in that Nauigation,
they knew not where they were at length: the Mariners
did giue sundry Iudgements: the Pilote was in great
perplexitie and sadnesse, their passengers lamented, and
bewayled their unfortunate successe: the Master of the
shippe layde the faulte to the Pilote, and the Pilote likewise
charged the Master, for it did appeare that they were
fallen out before. In this meane time their victuall
waxed skant, and their freshe water wanted, so that they
prepared themselues to die. Some cursed theyr fortune,
others asked mercie at Gods hande, lookyng for death
and to be eaten of the <em class="italic">Cariues</em>. And in this tyme of tribulation
came a Doue flying to the shippe, beyng on good
Friday at Sunne sette, and satte him on the shippe toppe:
whereat they were all comforted, and tooke it for a myracle
and good token and some wept with ioy, some sayd y<sup>t</sup>
God had sente the Doue to comforte them, others sayde
that lande was neare, and all gaue hartie thankes vnto
God, directing their course that way that the Doue flew:
and when the Doue was out of sighte, they sorrowed againe,

cryed, lande, lande, a chéerefull voyce to the saylers. The

Soone after that the Gouernoure <em class="italic">Ouando</em>
was in his regimente and office, <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
arriued at <em class="italic">Santo Domingo</em>, and the Gouernoures
Secretarie, called <em class="italic">Medina</em>,
receyued and lodged him, and also enformed
him of the estate of the Iland, and aduised
hym what was néedefull to doe, wishing that hée
would be a dweller there, and that he should haue a plot
to build vpon, with certaine ground for husbandry. But
<em class="italic">Cortez</em> his thought was cleane contrary, for hée iudged,
that as soone as he came thither, he should lade with gold,
whereby hée did little estéeme his friend <em class="italic">Medina</em> his coūsell,
saying, that he had rather goe to gather gold, than to
trauell in husbandrie. <em class="italic">Medina</em> yet perswaded him, that
he shoulde take better aduisement, for to finde golde, was
doubtfull, and very troubesome. This talke ended, <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
went to kisse the Gouernours handes, and to declare the
cause of his comming, with other newes from <em class="italic">Estremadure</em>
the Gouernours Coūtrey. The Gouernour friendly
welcommed him, and also perswaded him to abide there,
the which councell he accepted, and shortlye after wente
to the warres, whereof was Captayne <em class="italic">Iaymes Velasques</em>,
in the prouince of <em class="italic">Anigua Iaqua</em>, and <em class="italic">Guaca Iarima</em>, and
other Lordships whiche were not as yet pacifyed wyth
the late rebellion of <em class="italic">Anacoana</em> widdowe, who was a
gentlewoman of great liuing. <em class="italic">Ouando</em> gaue vnto <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
certayne Indyans in the Countrey of <em class="italic">Daiguao</em>, and also
the office of publike notarie in <em class="italic">Azua</em>, a towne whyche
the Gouernour had builded, and there dwelt <em class="italic">Cortez</em> fyue
or syxe yeares, and began to play the good husband. Now
in this meane season he woulde haue gone to <em class="italic">Veragua</em>,
which was reported to bee maruellous riche, with the
Captayn <em class="italic">Iaymes de Nicuesa</em>: but bycause of an empostume
that he had vnder his righte knée, he went not, and as it
happened, he was therein fortunate, for that thereby hée
escaped great perils and troubles, whiche happened to

The Lorde <em class="italic">Iames Colori</em> being Admirall
and chiefe Gouernour of the new <em class="italic">India</em>,
sent one <em class="italic">Iaymes Velasques</em> to conquer the
Ilande of <em class="italic">Cuba</em>, in the yeare .1511. And
gaue vnto him men, Armour, and other
thinges necessarie. And then <em class="italic">Hernando
Cortez</em> wente to that conquest as a Clearke to the Treasorer
called <em class="italic">Michaell de Passamontes</em>, for to kéepe the accompts
of the Kings fiftes and reuenewes, being so intreated
and required by the same <em class="italic">Iaymes Velasques</em>, bycause
he was holden for a man both able and diligente.
And it followed, that in the repartition of the lands conquered,
<em class="italic">Iaymes Velasques</em> gaue vnto <em class="italic">Cortez</em> the Indians of
<em class="italic">Manicorao</em>, in coniunct company with his brother in lawe
called <em class="italic">Iuan Xuarez</em>, wherevpon <em class="italic">Cortez</em> did inhabite in
<em class="italic">Saint Iames de Barucoa</em>, whiche was the first place of habitation
in that Ilande, whereas he bredde and broughte
vp Kine, Shéepe, and Mares, and was the first that hadde
there any heard or flocke, and with his <em class="italic">Indians</em> he gathered
great quantitie of golde, so that in short time he waxed
riche, and ioyned in company with one <em class="italic">Andres de Duero</em>
a Merchaunt, and put in two thousande Castlins for
his stocke. He was also highly estéemed with <em class="italic">Iaymes Velasques</em>,
and put in authoritie to dispatch businesse, and to
giue order for edifices. In his tyme he caused a money
house to be built, &#38; also an Hospital. At that time one <em class="italic">Iuan
Xuarez</em> naturall of the Citie of <em class="italic">Granada</em>, carried to the
Ile of <em class="italic">Cuba</em> his mother and thrée sisters, whiche came to
the Iland of <em class="italic">Santo Domingo</em>, with that vicequéene the
Lady <em class="italic">Mary</em> of <em class="italic">Toledo</em>, in Anno .1509. hoping to marrie
them there with rich men, for they were very poore. And
the one of them named <em class="italic">Cathelina</em> was wont to say, That
she shoulde be a greate Gentlewoman: it was eyther hyr
dreames and fantasies, or else some Astronomer hadde
made hir beléeue so, but hir mother was reported to bée
very cunning. The maydens were beautifull, for which
cause, and also being there but fewe Spanishe women,
they were muche made of, and often feasted. But <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
was woer to the saide <em class="italic">Cathelina</em>, and at the ende married
with hir: Although at the first there was some strife about
the matter, and <em class="italic">Cortez</em> put in prison, bycause he refused
hir for his wife, but she demaunded him as hir husband
by faith and troth of hand: wherein <em class="italic">Iaymes Velasques</em>
did stande hir friende, by reason of an other sister of hyrs
which he had, but of an euil name. It so fell out that one
<em class="italic">Baltazar Bermudez</em>, <em class="italic">Iuan Xuares</em>, and the two <em class="italic">Anthony Velasques</em>,
with one <em class="italic">Villegas</em> accused <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, that he ought to
marrie with <em class="italic">Cathelina</em>, yet those witnesses spake of euill
will many things, as touching y<sup>e</sup> affaires cōmitted to his
charge, alleadging y<sup>t</sup> he vsed secret dealing with certaine
persons. The which causes although they were not true,
yet they carried great colour thereof. For why? many wēt
secretly to <em class="italic">Cortez</em> his house, complayning of <em class="italic">Iaymes Velasques</em>.
Some bycause they had not iust repertitiō of the cōquered
Indiās, and other some not according to deserte.
Contrariwyse <em class="italic">Iames Velasques</em> gaue credit to his talebearers,
bicause <em class="italic">Cortez</em> refused to marrie w<sup>t</sup> <em class="italic">Cathelina Xuarez</em>,
&#38; vsed vncourteous words vnto him in y<sup>e</sup> presēce of many
that stoode by, and also commaunded him to warde. And
when <em class="italic">Cortez</em> sawe himselfe in the stockes, he feared some
proces of false witnesse, as many times dothe happen in
those parties. At time conueniente he brake the locke off
the stockes, and layde hand vpon the Sword and Target
of the kéeper, and brake vp a windowe, escaping thereby
into the stréete, and tooke the Church for Sanctuary. But
when <em class="italic">Iaymes Velasques</em> had notice thereof, he was greatlye
offended with <em class="italic">Christopher Lagos</em> the Iayler, saying, that
for money he had losed him: wherefore he procured by
al meanes to plucke him out of the Sanctuary. But <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
hauing intelligence of his dealing, did resiste and
withstand his force. Yet notwithstanding one daye <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
walking before the Churche dore, and being carelesse
of his businesse, was caught by the backe with a Serieant
called <em class="italic">Iohn Esquier</em> and others, and then was put aboorde
a Shyppe vnder hatches. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> was welbeloued
among his neighboures, who did well consider the euill
will that the Gouernour bare vnto him. But nowe <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
séeing himselfe vnder hatches, despaired of his libertie,
and did verily thinke, that he shoulde be sent prisoner
to the Chancerie of <em class="italic">Santo Domingo</em>, or else to <em class="italic">Spayne</em>, who
being in this extremitie, soughte all meanes to get hys
foote out of the chayne, and at length he gote it out, and
the same nighte he changed his apparell with a ladde
that serued him, and by the Pump of the Shippe he gote
out, not heard of any his kéepers, climbing softly along
the Shippe syde, he entred the Skiffe and went hys way
therewith, and bycause they shoulde not pursue after
him, he losed the Boate of another Shippe that roade by
them. The Currant of <em class="italic">Macaguanigua</em> a riuer of <em class="italic">Barucoa</em>,
was so fierce, that he could not gette in with his Skiffe,
bicause he had no help to row, &#38; was also very werie, fearing
to be drowned if he should put himselfe to the land,
wherefore he stripped himselfe naked, and tyed a nyghtkerchiefe
aboute hys head, with certayne wrytings apperteyning
to his office of Notarie and Clearkshippe to
the Treasourer, and other things that were agaynst the
Gouernoure <em class="italic">Iames Velasques</em>, and in this sorte swamme
to lande, and wente home to hys owne house, and spake
with <em class="italic">Iohn Xuarez</em> hys brother in law, and tooke Sanctuarie
agayne with Armour. Then the Gouernoure <em class="italic">Iames
Velasques</em> sente hym worde, that all matters shoulde bée
forgotten, and that they shoulde remayne friendes, as in
tyme past they hadde bin, and to goe with hym to the
Warres agaynste certayne Indians that hadde rebelled.
<em class="italic">Cortez</em> made hym no aunswere, but incontinent married
with mistresse <em class="italic">Catalina Xuarez</em> according to his promise,
and to lyue in peace. <em class="italic">Iames Velasques</em> procéeded on
hys iourney wyth a greate companye agaynste the Rebelles.
Then sayde <em class="italic">Cortez</em> to hys brother in lawe <em class="italic">Iohn
Xuares</em>, bryng me (quoth he) my Launce and my Crosbowe
to the Townes ende. And so in that euening hée
wente out of Sanctuarie, and taking hys Crossebowe
in hande, hée wente with his brother in lawe to a certayne
Farme, where <em class="italic">Iames Velasques</em> was alone, with his
householde seruauntes, for hys armye was lodged in a
Village thereby, and came thither somewhat late, and
at suche tyme as the Gouernoure was perusing hys
Booke of charges, and knocked at his dore which stoode
open, saying: Héere is <em class="italic">Cortez</em> that woulde speake with
the Gouernoure, and so wente in. When <em class="italic">Iames Velasques</em>
sawe hym armed, and at such an houre, he was maruellously
afrayde, desiring hym to rest hymselfe, and also to
accepte hys Supper: No Sir (quoth he) my onely comming
is, but to knowe the complayntes you haue of me,
and to satisfye you therein, and also to bée youre friende
and seruitor. They then embraced eache other in token
of friendship. And after long talke, they lay both in one
bedde, where <em class="italic">Iames de Orrelano</em> founde them, who went to
carrie newes to the Gouernoure, how <em class="italic">Cortez</em> had fledde.
After this sort came <em class="italic">Cortez</em> agayne to his former friendshyppe
with <em class="italic">Iames Velasques</em>, and procéeded with him to
the Warres, but afterwarde at his returne, he was lyke
to haue bin drowned in the sea: For as he came from the
Caues of <em class="italic">Bani</em> to visite certayne of hys Shepheardes
and <em class="italic">Indians</em> that wrought in the Pines of <em class="italic">Barrucoa</em> where
his dwelling was, his <em class="italic">Canoa</em> or little boate ouerthrew, being
night, and halfe a league from land, with tempeste,
wherby he was put to his shiftes, and forced to swimme,
and happened to espye lyght that certayne Shepheardes
had which were at supper néere the Sea side. By suche
like perils and daungers, runne the excellente menne
their race, vntill that they arriue at the Hauen where
their good lotte is preserued.</p>

<em class="italic">Fraunces Hernandes de Cordoua</em> did first discouer
<em class="italic">Xucatan</em>, going with thrée Shyps
for <em class="italic">Indians</em>, or else to barter. These
Shippes were sette forthe by <em class="italic">Christopher
Morante</em>, and <em class="italic">Lope Ochoa de Saizedo</em>,
in Anno .1517. And although he broughte
home nothing at that time but stripes, yet he broughte
perfect relation, how the Countrey was rich of gold and
siluer, and the people of the countrey clothed. Then <em class="italic">Iames
Velasques</em> Gouernoure of the Iland of <em class="italic">Cuba</em>, sent the next
yeare following his kinsman, called <em class="italic">Iohn de Grijalua</em>, with
two hundred <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em> in foure Shippes, thinking to obtayne
much gold and siluer for his Merchandise at those
places, which <em class="italic">Fraunces Hernandez</em> had enformed him: So
that <em class="italic">Iohn de Grijalua</em> wente to <em class="italic">Xucatan</em>, and there foughte
with the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Champoton</em>, and was hurt. From thēce
he entred the riuer of <em class="italic">Tauasco</em>, which <em class="italic">Grijalua</em> hadde so named,
in the whiche place he bartered for things of small
value. He had in exchaunge golde, cloth of cotten wooll,
and other curious things wrought of feathers. He was
also at Saint <em class="italic">Iohn de Vlhua</em>, and tooke possession for the
King, in the name of <em class="italic">Iames Velasques</em>, and there also exchanged
his Haberdashe wares, for Golde, and Couerlets
of cotten, and feathers: and if he hadde considered his
good fortune, he would haue planted habitation in so rich
a land, as his company did earnestly request him, and if
he had so done, then had he bin as <em class="italic">Cortez</em> was. But suche
wealth was not for him which knew it not, although he
excused himselfe, saying, he went not to inhabite, but to
barter onely in traffike of his Marchandise, and to discouer
whether that land of <em class="italic">Xucatan</em> were an Ilande, or no.
And finding it a mayne land, and populous, he left off for
very feare. Likewise, some of his company were desirous
to returne to <em class="italic">Cuba</em>, among whome, was one <em class="italic">Pedro de Aluado</em>,
who was farre in loue with a woman of that countrey.
So they determined to returne, with relation to the
Gouernoure of suche things as hadde happened till that
day, and sayled homewardes along the coast to <em class="italic">Panuco</em>,
and so came to <em class="italic">Cuba</em>, to the greate griefe of many of hys
company. Yea some of them wept, with sorrowe that hée
would not abide in that rich countrey. He was fiue monethes
vpon his voyage homewarde from land to lande,
and eyght monethes till his returne to the Citie. But
when he came home, the Gouernoure hauing hearde of
his procéedings, would not looke vppon him, whiche was
hys iust reward.</p>

Bycause <em class="italic">Iohn de Grijalua</em> was absent a lōger

wondered therat, and likewise to heare the whole relatiō
of the iourney. Yet the gouernour feared the returne of
his kinsman, bycause some of his companye that came
sicke and diseased from those parties, saide that <em class="italic">Grijalua</em>
meaned not to inhabite there, and that the people and
land was great, and also how the same people were warlike:
likewise the gouernour feared the wisedome and
courage of his kinsman. Wherevppon he determined to
send thyther certaine shippes, with souldiers and armor
and other trifling things, thinking chiefly to enrich himself
by barter, and also to inhabite by force. He requested
one <em class="italic">Baltazer Vermudez</em> to take that voyage in hand, who
accepted the offer, but he demaunded thrée thousand duckets
for his furniture and prouision. Their gouernour
hearing this demaund, answered, that in such sorte the
charges would be more than the profite: And so for that
tyme lefte off the matter, bycause he was couetous, and
loth to spend, thinking to prouide an army at other mēs
cost, as he had done before, when <em class="italic">Grijalua</em> went firste on
that voyage, for at that time one <em class="italic">Francisco de Montezo</em> did
furnish one shippe. And also certaine gentlemen called
<em class="italic">Alaunso Fernādez</em>, <em class="italic">Porto Carero</em>, <em class="italic">Alaunso de Auila</em> &#38; <em class="italic">Iames
de Ordas</em> with manye others, wente with <em class="italic">Grijalua</em> at theyr
proper costes and charges. It followed that the gouernour
brake the matter to <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, &#38; required that the voyage
shoulde be set forth betwixte them, knowing that
<em class="italic">Cortez</em> had two thousand Castlyns of gold in the power
of one <em class="italic">Andres de Duero</em>, a merchaunt, and also that <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
was a man diligent, wise, and of stoute courage. <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
being of haughtye stomacke, accepted both the voyage
and the charges, thinking the cost would not be much .&#38;c.
So that the voyage and agréemente was concluded,
whervpon they sent one <em class="italic">Iohn de Sanzedo</em> to the kings coūsel
and chauncery, resident in the Iland of <em class="italic">Santo Domingo</em>,
who were then religyous persons to haue and obtain
of them licence, fréelye to goe and traffike into those
parties of newe discouerie, and also to séeke for
<em class="italic">Iohn de Grijalua</em>, for they imagyned that wythout hym
small trafficke woulde bee hadde, whyche was, to exchaunge
trifles of Haberdashe for golde and syluer.
The chiefe rulers of gouernemente at that tyme
in y<sup>e</sup> kings counsell there, were these following, <em class="italic">Segniour
Aloūso de Sāto Domingo</em>, <em class="italic">Segniour Luys de Figueroa</em>, &#38; <em class="italic">Segniour
Barnardo de Munsanedo</em>, who graunted the licence, and
appointed <em class="italic">Hernando Cortez</em> for captaine Generall of the
voyage, and setter forth in company of <em class="italic">Iames Velasques</em>.
They also appointed a Treasurer, and Surueyour to
procure for the kings portion or parte, whych was
according to custome one fifte parte. In thys meane
season <em class="italic">Cortez</em> prepared hymselfe for the Iourney,
and communed wyth hys especiall friendes to sée who
woulde beare hym companye: And hee founde thrée
hundred men that agréed to his request. He then bought
a Caruell and Vergantine, and another Caruell that
<em class="italic">Pedro de Aluarado</em> brought home. An other Vergantine
he had of <em class="italic">Iames Valesques</em>: he prouided for them armour,
artillery, and other Munition: hee brought also wyne
Oyle, Beanes, Pease, and other victuals necessarye: he
toke vp also vppon hys credite, of one <em class="italic">Iames Sauzedo</em>
muche Haberdashe, to the value of seauen hundred
Castlyns in golde. The gouernour <em class="italic">Velasques</em> deliuered
vnto hym a thousande Castlyns whyche he possessed
of the goods of one <em class="italic">Pamfilo de Naruaiz</em> in hys absence,
alleaging that he had no other money of hys owne proper.
And beeyng in thys manner agréed, the Articles
and Couenauntes were drawen and set downe in
wryting, before a Notary, called <em class="italic">Alounso de Escalantes</em>,
the thrée and twenty day of October <em class="italic">Anno</em> .1518.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The gouernour an old enemy.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Courage of <em class="italic">Cortez</em>.</div>

<p>In this meane time arriued at <em class="italic">Cuba</em>, <em class="italic">Iohn de Grijalua</em>,
vpon whose arriuall, the gouernour chaunged his purpose
and pretence, for hee refused to disburse any more
money, nor yet would consent that <em class="italic">Cortez</em> should furnish
his Nauie. For the onely cause was, that he ment to dispatch
backe againe his kinseman and his army. But to
behold the stoute courage of <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, his charges, and liberalitie
in expences, it was straunge, and to sée how hee
was deceiued. And also to cōsider, the flatterie and deceite
of his aduersarie, yea what complaints were made to the
Lord Admiral, saying that <em class="italic">Cortez</em> was subtil, high minded,
and a louer of honor, which were tokēs that he wold
rebel, being in place conuenient, and that he woulde reuenge
olde griefes. Also it grieued <em class="italic">Vermudez</em> that he had
not accepted y<sup>t</sup> voyage, vnto whō it was once offered, seing
the great treasure that <em class="italic">Grijalua</em> had brought, &#38; what
a rich land the countrey newely discouered was. Also he
pretended that y<sup>e</sup> gouernor would be chieftain of y<sup>e</sup> fléet,
although his kinesman were not fit for y<sup>e</sup> roome. The gouernor
also thought y<sup>t</sup> he being slacke, <em class="italic">Cortez</em> would also
be slacke. But yet he séeing <em class="italic">Cortez</em> earnestly procéed, he
sent one <em class="italic">Amador de Larez</em> a principal mā, to intreate him
to leaue off y<sup>e</sup> voyage (cōsidering y<sup>t</sup> <em class="italic">Grijalua</em> was returned)
and y<sup>t</sup> he would pay him al y<sup>e</sup> costs &#38; charges y<sup>t</sup> he had layd
out. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> vnderstāding the gouernors minde, made answere
vnto <em class="italic">Larez</em>, y<sup>t</sup> he wold not leaue of the Iorney, for
very shame, nor yet breake the agréement made. And also
if <em class="italic">Valasques</em> would send a Nauy for his owne account,
he woulde be contente, for (quoth he) I haue alreadie my
licence and dispatch of the fathers &#38; gouernours. And thē
he conferred with his friendes, to knowe their mindes if
that they would fauour and beare him cōpany, at whose
handes he found both ready helpe and friendshippe. Hee
sought then for money, and toke vp vpon his credit foure
M. Castlyns in gold, of his friend <em class="italic">Andreas de Duero</em>, &#38; of
<em class="italic">Pedro de Xerez</em> &#38; others. With y<sup>e</sup> which money he bought
two ships, 6. horses, &#38; much apparel, &#38; began to furnish a
house &#38; kepe a good table for cōmers &#38; goers: he went also
armed like a captaine, &#38; many wayting &#38; attēding vpon
him, whereat diuerse murmured, saying that hee was a
Lord without rente. In thys meane whyle came
<em class="italic">Grijalua</em> to the Cittie of Sainte <em class="italic">Iames de Cuba</em>: but hys
kinseman the gouernour woulde not loke vppon hym
bycause he had lefte and forsaken so riche a lande. Also
it grieued him inwardlye that <em class="italic">Cortez</em> procéeded thitherward
so strong and mightye, and coulde by no meanes
disturbe or lette hym, and to sée the greate traine that
wayted vppon hym wyth manye of them that had byn
the other voyage with <em class="italic">Grijalua</em>: yea if that he should disturbe
him, bloud shedde would follow in the Citie. So
that he was forced to dissemble his sorow. Yet (as many
affyrme) hee commaunded that hee shoulde haue no
victuals solde vnto hym. Nowe <em class="italic">Cortez</em> departed from
thence, proclayming himselfe for General, and that the
gouernour <em class="italic">Valasques</em> had nothing to doe wyth hys Nauie,
requesting his soldiers to enbarke themselues wyth
such victuals as they had. He also bargayned wyth one
<em class="italic">Fernando Alfonso</em> for certaine Hogges and Shéepe that
were prepared for the shambles, and gaue vnto hym a
chayne of golde and brouches for payment, and also moneye,
to pay the penaltie that the butcher fel into for not
prouiding the Cittie. And so he departed frō Saint <em class="italic">Iames

<em class="italic">Cortez</em> departed from Saint <em class="italic">Iames de Barocoa</em>
with small prouision of victuals for
suche a number of men, and also for the
nauigation whyche as yet was vncertaine.
And beeyng out of that parte,
he sent <em class="italic">Pedro Xuarez Gallinato</em> with a Caruell to <em class="italic">Iaymaica</em>
for vittailes, commaunding him, that those things which
he should there buy, to goe therwith to <em class="italic">Cape de Corrientes</em>,
or to <em class="italic">S. Anthonies</em> point, which is the farthest part of that
Iland Westward. And he himselfe wente with his companye
to <em class="italic">Macaca</em>, and boughte there greate quantitie of
bread, and some Hogges, of one <em class="italic">Taymaio</em>. Then he procéeded
to the Trinitie Ilande, and there boughte an other
Shippe of one <em class="italic">Alonso Guillen</em>. And of perticulare persons
he bought thrée Horses, and fiue hundred bushels of
Corne. And being there at roade, he had aduice, that <em class="italic">Iohn
Nonez Sedenio</em> passed that way with a Shippe laden with
victuals, for to make sale thereof at the Mynes. Wherevppon
he sente <em class="italic">Iames de Ordas</em>, with a Caruel well armed,
for to take him, and to bring him vnto <em class="italic">S. Anthonies</em> point.
<em class="italic">Ordas</em> went and tooke him at the Channell <em class="italic">de Iardines</em>, and
brought him to the place appointed. <em class="italic">Sedenio</em> broughte the
register of his marchandise, whiche was greate store of
bread, Bacon, and Hennes: <em class="italic">Cortez</em> gaue him chaynes of
golde, and other pieces for payment, and a bil for the rest.
In consideration whereof, <em class="italic">Sedenio</em> wente with him to the
Conquest. In the Trinitie Ilande <em class="italic">Cortez</em> gathered togyther
two hundred men more, who had bin in <em class="italic">Grijalua</em> hys
company, and were dwellers in that Iland, and in <em class="italic">Matancas</em>,
<em class="italic">Carenias</em>, and other Villages, and sending his ships
forward, he went with his men by land to <em class="italic">Hauana</em>, which
was then inhabited on the South side in the mouth of the
riuer called <em class="italic">Onicaxinall</em>, but there they would sell him no
prouision, for feare of the Gouernour <em class="italic">Velasques</em>. But yet
one <em class="italic">Christopher Galsada</em> rentgatherer to the Byshoppe, and
receyuer for the Popes Bulles, solde to him great store
of Bacon and bread of that Countrey called <em class="italic">Maiz</em>, and
other prouision, whereby his fléete was reasonably prouided .&#38;c.
And then he beganne to distribute his men and
vittayles aboorde eache vessell in good order. Then came
<em class="italic">Aluarado</em> with his caruell, with his other friendes <em class="italic">Christopher
de Olid</em>, <em class="italic">Alonso de Auila</em>, <em class="italic">Francisco de Monteio</em>, &#38; manye
others of <em class="italic">Grijalua</em> hys company, who had bin to talke
with the Gouernoure <em class="italic">Velasques</em>. And among them came
one <em class="italic">Garnica</em> so called, with letters for <em class="italic">Cortez</em> from <em class="italic">Velasques</em>,
wherein he wrote, desiring him to abide there, for
that he meant to come himselfe, or else to send vnto hym,
to treate of matters profitable for them both.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A snare layde for Cortez.</div>

<p>Also, the sayd Gouernour sente other secret letters to
<em class="italic">Iames de Ordas</em> and others, requiring them to apprehende
and take prisoner <em class="italic">Cortez</em>. Nowe <em class="italic">Ordas</em> did inuite <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
to a banket aboorde his Caruel, thinking by that meanes
to catche <em class="italic">Cortez</em> in a snare, and so to carrie him prisoner
to the Citie of <em class="italic">Saint Iames de Barocoa</em>, but <em class="italic">Cortez</em> vnderstood
the matter, and fayned hymselfe to be very sicke, and also
fearing some vprore, he went aboorde his Shippe Admirall,
and shot off a péece of Ordinance, giuing warning
to his Nauie to be in a readinesse to make sayle, and to
follow him to <em class="italic">Saint Anthonies</em> poynte, whiche was done
with expedition, and there in the Towne of <em class="italic">Guani Guaniga</em>
he mustered his men, and found fiue hundred and fiftie
Spanyardes, whereof fiftie were Marriners. He deuided
them into eleuen companies, and appointed these persons
following for Captaynes, that is to say, <em class="italic">Alonso de Auila</em>,
<em class="italic">Alonso Fernandez Porto Carrero</em>, <em class="italic">Iaimes de Ordas</em>, <em class="italic">Francisco

Escalante</em>, <em class="italic">Iohn Velasques de Leon</em>, <em class="italic">Christopher de Olid</em>, and
one <em class="italic">Escouar</em>, and he himselfe as Generall tooke one Company.
He made these many Captaynes, bycause his
whole fléete was eleuen sayle, and that eache of them
shoulde seuerally be Captayne, both of Shippe and men.
He also appoynted for chiefe Pilote <em class="italic">Antonio de Alamines</em>,
who had taken charge before with <em class="italic">Francisco de Hernandez
de Cordoua</em>, and <em class="italic">Grijalua</em>, &#38;c. He carried also 200
<em class="italic">Indians</em>, borne in y<sup>e</sup> Ile of <em class="italic">Cuba</em>, to serue and to carrie baggage,
&#38; also certayne <em class="italic">Negros</em> with some <em class="italic">Indian</em> womē, and
sixtéene Horses &#38; Mares, with great prouision of Bacon,
corne, bisket, hennes, wine, oyle, pease, and other fruites,
w<sup>t</sup> great store of Haberdash, as Belles, necklaces, beades
of glasse, collers, points, pinnes, purses, nedels, girdels,
thredde, kniues, sissers, pinsars, hāmers, hatchets, Shirts,
Coyfes, headkerchiefes, handkerchiefs, bréeches, coates,
clokes, cappes, Marriners bréeches, all y<sup>e</sup> which Merchādise
be deuided amōg his nauie. The Ship Admiral was
of the burthen of a hūdred Tunnes. Other thrée Shippes
of the burthen of eightie Tunnes the péece. All the residue
were small withoute ouerloppe, and vergantines. The
deuice of his ensigne or aunciente, was flames of fire in
white and blewe, with a redde crosse in the middest, and
bordred round with letters, in the Lattine and Spanishe
tongs, which signified this in effect: friends, let vs follow
the Crosse, and with liuely faith with this standerde we
shall obteyne victorie. The premisses (as ye haue hearde)
was the furniture that <em class="italic">Cortez</em> prouided for his iourney,
and with so small a thing he conquered so greate and
mightie an Empire, &#38; strange Countreys, vnknowen at
that time. There was neuer Captayne that did with like
army ouercome so infinite a people, &#38; bring both thē and
their coūtrey vnder subiectiō. He caried no money to pay
his souldiers, but was rather much indebted to others at
his departure. And to say the truth, there néeded any money
to make pay to those souldiers that went to the Cōquest,
for if they shuld haue serued for wages, they would
haue gone to other places néere hand. But in <em class="italic">India</em>, euery
one pretēdeth y<sup>e</sup> state of a noble man, or else great riches.
Now all y<sup>e</sup> fléete being in readinesse (as ye haue hearde,)

My louing fellowes and déere friendes, it
is certayne that euery valiant manne of
stoute courage, doth procure by déedes to
make him selfe equall with the excellente
men of his time, yea and with those that
were before his time. So it is, that I do now take in hād
such an enterprise, as godwilling shall be héereafter of
greate fame, for myne heart doth pronosticate vnto mée,
that we shall winne greate and rich Countreys, and manye
people, as yet neuer séene to anye of oure nation, yea
and (I beléeue) greater Kingdomes than those of oure
Kinges. And I assure you, that the desire of glory dothe
further extend, than treasure, the whiche in sorte, mortall
life doth obtayne. I haue now prepared Shippes, Armor,
Horses, and other furniture for the warres, with victuall
sufficient, and all things that are vsed as necessary in
Conquestes. I haue bin at greate costes and charges,
wherein I haue not onely employed myne owne goodes,
but also the goodes of my friendes, yet me thinketh that
the employmente thereof dothe encrease my treasure and
honor. We ought (louing fellowes) to leaue off small
things, when great matters doe offer themselues. And
euen as my trust is in God, euen so greater profite shall
come to our kings, and a nation of this oure enterprise,
than hath héeretofore of any other. I doe not speake how
acceptable it will be to God our sauiour, for whose loue
I do chiefly and willingly hazard my goods and trauel. I
will not nowe treat of the perils and danger of life that
I haue passed since I began this voyage. This I say, that
good men doe rather expect renoune, than treasure. We
doe now attempt and begin warre that is both good and
iust, and the almighty God in whose name and holy faith
this voyage is begonne, will assuredly graunte vnto vs
victory, and the time will shew the end of things well begonne.
Therefore we will now haue an other manner in
our procéedings, than eyther <em class="italic">Cordoua</em> or <em class="italic">Grijalua</em> hadde,
whereof I meane not nowe to dispute, for the presente
time doth hasten vs away, but at our arriuall, we will do
what shall séeme vnto vs conuenient. Héere déere friends
do I lay before you great gaynes, but wrapped in greate
trauell, yet <em class="italic">Vertue</em> is an enimie to idlenesse .&#38;c. Therefore
if you will accept hope for <em class="italic">Vertue</em>, or <em class="italic">Vertue</em> for hope, and
also if ye forsake me not, as I will not forsake you, I
will with Gods help make you in shorte time the richest
men that euer passed this way. I doe sée you are but fewe
in number, but yet such men of haughtie courage, that no
force or strength of <em class="italic">Indians</em> can offende. Likewise wée
haue experience, that Christ our sauiour hathe alwayes
fauoured our nation in these parties. Therfore my déere

With the aforesayd communication, <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
gaue great hope to his cōpany of waightie
matters, yea and great admiration of
his person, so that all his company had an
earnest desire to procéede on that iorney.
And <em class="italic">Cortez</em> likewise reioyced, to sée his
men so willing: and incontinente, they embarqued themselues,
and after their prayers made vnto God, hoysed
vp their sayles, and with faire winde departed the eighttenth
day of Februarie Anno 1519. And beyng at Sea, he
willed all his nauie (as the vse is) to haue S. Peter for
their patrone, warning them alwayes to follow the Admirall
(wherin he went) bycause he carried a light for the
night season to guide them the way, whiche was almost
East and West from <em class="italic">S. Anthonies</em> point, being the nerest
part of <em class="italic">Cuba</em> to <em class="italic">Cape de Cotoche</em>, which is the first lād point
of <em class="italic">Yucatan</em>, whither they were bounde, so y<sup>t</sup> being there,
they might run alōg the coast, betwene the North point

to passe ouer the gulfe betweene <em class="italic">Cuba</em> &#38; <em class="italic">Yucatan</em>, being
little aboue lx. leagues, the winde rose vp at Northeast

wer the Admirall, and Captayne <em class="italic">Morla</em> his Ship,
who had lost his Ruther, but by shoting off a pece, <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
vnderstood his necessitie, and came vering to him, and amayned
his sailes to succour him, being in y<sup>e</sup> night season.
Yet when the day appeared, it pleased God y<sup>t</sup> the rage of
the tempest ceassed, &#38; being cléere day, they found agayne
their Ruther, and trimmed the Ship, and made sayle, and
sayled that day and the next following, without sighte of
land, or any of the Fléete. But the third day they arriued
at a cape or point of land, called Womens cape. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> cōmanded
<em class="italic">Morla</em> to follow him, directing his course to séeke
the residue of his Fléete, and arriued in this sorte at the
Iland of <em class="italic">Acusamil</em>, and there found all his nauie excepte
one, whereof they hearde no newes in many dayes after.
The people of that Ilande beholding suche a straunge
sight, were in great feare and admiratiō, so that they gathered
their stuffe and wente vp into the Mountaynes.
<em class="italic">Cortez</em> caused a certayne number of his mē to goe a land
to a Towne which was néere the place where they were
arriued, and they foūd the towne wrought with Masons
worke, and good building, but they founde no creature
therein, yet in some houses they foūd cloth made of cottē
woll, and certaine Iewels of gold. Also they entred into
a high tower made of stoneworke, néere the sea side, and
there they founde nothing but Idols of earth and stone.
With this newes they returned to <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, and enformed
him what they had séene, and also many faire sowē fields
of <em class="italic">Maiz</em>, and great store of hiues of Bées, and many trées
of fruites, and also presented vnto him the gold and other
things that they had foūd. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> reioyced with y<sup>e</sup> newes
but yet maruelled that the people were fledde, considering
that when <em class="italic">Grijalua</em> was there, they had not so done, wherby
he iudged, that his nauie béeyng greater, caused them
to feare and flie, and likewise he feared least a snare were
prepared for him. Then he cōmanded to vnship his Horses
for thrée causes: the one to discouer the Countrey: and
the other to fight if néede were: and also to grase thē, hauing
there abūdance. Also he vnshipped his mē of warre,
and sent them to discouer the land. And in the thickest of
the Mountaynes, they found four women, and thrée childrē,
whome they brought to <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, so that not vnderstanding
their language, by signes &#38; tokens they ymagined
that one of thē was the mother to the children, &#38; mistresse
to the other women. The pore creatures bewayled theyr
captiuitie. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> made muche of them, &#38; apparrelled the
mistresse as wel as he might with Spanish attire: and to
hir seruants he gaue loking glasses and sissers: and to the
little children other toyes to play withall, vsing no dishonestie
towards thē. And thē he determined to send one of
the wenches to call hir maister, and to enforme him how
well they were intreated. In this meane season came
certaine spies lurking a farre off, by the cōmandement of
their Lord, who was called <em class="italic">Calachuni</em>, to bring newes of

gaue vnto them certayne trifles, and sent others to their
Lord, and returned thē w<sup>t</sup> embassage on his behalfe &#38; his

folke from whome he had fledde, promising, that neyther
his person, nor none of his countrey should receyue anye
molestation of him, nor of any of his company. <em class="italic">Calachuni</em>
vnderstāding this friendshippe, and also with the loue hée
bare to his wife and childrē, came the next day following
with all the Townesmen, in whose houses y<sup>e</sup> Spanyards
were lodged, who woulde not permitte that their guestes
should giue place. And the Lorde commaunded, that they
should be wel entertayned, and frō that day forward prouided
them of bread, fishe, honey, &#38; fruite. <em class="italic">Calachuni</em> spake
and saluted <em class="italic">Cortez</em> with greate humilitie and ceremonie,
and euen so was he louingly receyued, &#38; wel entertained.
<em class="italic">Cortez</em> did then declare vnto him the commoditie that
would ensue vnto him by that nation. And also presented
vnto him &#38; his cōpany many toyes, which were vnto thē
of small valewe, but muche estéemed among them, yea
more than golde. And moreouer <em class="italic">Cortez</em> cōmaunded, that
all the golde and other things that his men had taken in
the Towne, shoulde be broughte before him, and placed it
so, that euery <em class="italic">Indian</em> knewe his owne, and was restored
vnto them, whereat they were not a little ioyfull, wondering
at the liberalitie of the straungers, and departed
both merrie and riche with their straunge giftes, and
went throughout al the Iland, shewing to their fellowes
their presentes, commaunding them in the name of <em class="italic">Calachuni</em>
their Lord, to returne euery man to his house, with
ther wiues and children, commending highly the honest
and gentle nature of the straungers. With this newes
and commaundemente, euery man returned to his house
and Towne from whence he had fledde. And after thys
sort their feare was past, and they prouided the Camp abundantly
of honey, bread, waxe, fishe, and frute, all the

Now <em class="italic">Cortez</em> seeing these <em class="italic">Indians</em> quiet and
wel pleased, and also very seruiceable, he
did determyne to take away theyr Idols,
and to giue them a remembraunce of Iesu
Christ borne of the Virgin Mary, by one
<em class="italic">Melchior</em> a fisher man and very rustical, who had bin ther
before with <em class="italic">Francisco Hernandez de Cordoua</em>, who declared
vnto them, that <em class="italic">Cortez</em> his Lord and captaine would enforme
them of a better god, and better lawes, than those
which they maintained. The <em class="italic">Indians</em> answered, that they
were contented therewith, and went with them vnto
their temples, and there brake downe their Idols, and
celebrated diuine seruice, teaching them to adore and
worshippe Christ crucifyed, so that they were verye attentiue
to the doctrine, and ceased sacrifise of men which
they were wōt to vse. These <em class="italic">Indians</em> did wonder much at
the shippes and horses, yea and marueyled as muche at
our colour and beardes, so that many times they would
come and féele them, and signifyed vnto them by signes
and tokens towardes <em class="italic">Yucatan</em>, that there were fiue or sixe
bearded men. Then <em class="italic">Cortez</em> considering how profitable it
wold be to haue an interpreter to vnderstand and to be
vnderstood, he besought <em class="italic">Calachuni</em> that he would appoint
a messenger to carrye a letter to the bearded men, who
were in the power of a great Lord and Tyrant, and <em class="italic">Calachuni</em>
found none that durst take that iourney in hand,
fearing that they should be slaine and eaten. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> seing
this, entreated with faire words, thrée of the <em class="italic">Indians</em> that
serued him to accept the iourney, and gaue thē rewards
for theyr labour: yet the <em class="italic">Indians</em> excused them, saying that
they should be slayne, notwithstanding with faire promises
and rewardes, they accepted the voyage, so that
<em class="italic">Cortez</em> wrote with them this letter following.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Worshipful sirs, I departed from <em class="italic">Cuba</em> with eleuen
saile in my fléete, furnished with fiue hundred and
fiftie Spaniardes, and I arriued here at <em class="italic">Acusamil</em> from
whence I write you this letter. The people of this Ilād
haue certifyed me, that there is in that countrey fiue or
sixe bearded men, and in al pointes like vnto vs: they can
not here enforme me of anye other signes or tokens, but
hereby I do coniecture, and certainely beleue that ye be
Spaniards. Both I and these gentlemen of my company
do come to discouer and inhabit this land, we hartily
pray you y<sup>t</sup> within sixe days after the receite hereof, ye
come vnto vs, w<sup>t</sup>out any excuse or delay, and if ye so doe,
al we of this nauie wil gratifye your gentlenesse &#38; good
seruice y<sup>t</sup> ye shal do vnto vs. I do send you a Vergantyn
wherin you may come, &#38; two shippes for your safeconduct.</p>

<p>This letter being written, there was found an inconuenience,
which was, they knew not how to carrye
the letter so secretly y<sup>t</sup> it might not be séene, &#38; they taken
for espies, wherof the saide <em class="italic">Indians</em> stoode in great feare.
Thē <em class="italic">Cortez</em> bethought him, y<sup>t</sup> the letter wold passe wrapped
in y<sup>e</sup> haire of the head of one of thē, for ordinarily the
<em class="italic">Indians</em> wear lōg heare, &#38; on their solemn feasts &#38; in wars
they vse their haire platted &#38; boūd about their forheads.
And he appointed captaine of the Vergantine wherin y<sup>e</sup>
messēgers wēt, <em class="italic">Iohn de Escalante</em>, &#38; <em class="italic">Iames de Ordas</em> for captaine
of the other two ships, with fiftie men if any nede
should happen. So shortly after the ships arriued at the
place appointed, <em class="italic">Escalante</em> set a land his messengers, and
abode there eight days they returne, although he promised
thē to abide there but sixe dayes. And thē séeing that
they came not, he surmysed y<sup>t</sup> they were either slaine or
taken captiues: &#38; so returned backe againe to <em class="italic">Acusamill</em>
without his messēgers, wherof al the army were sorowful,
&#38; chiefly <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, thinking that the <em class="italic">Indians</em> had wrōg

<em class="italic">Calachuni</em> and all his subiectes were full
of heauinesse (as it semed) with the departure
of the Christians, bycause they were
wel vsed at their handes. From <em class="italic">Acusamil</em>
the fleete sayled to get the coast of <em class="italic">Yucatan</em>
to the cape called Womens point, with prosperous
weather, &#38; there <em class="italic">Cortez</em> came to an Anker, desirous to sée
the disposition of the lande, and the manner of the people:
but it liked him not, so that y<sup>e</sup> next day folowing being
shrouetuisday, he departed, meaning to double the
sayde cape, and so to passe to <em class="italic">Cotoche</em> and to viewe it.
But before they hadde doubled the poynte, <em class="italic">Peter de Aluarado</em>
shotte off a piece, in token that hee was in great
peril, wherevppon the other shippes drewe neare to
knowe what hadde happened: And when <em class="italic">Cortez</em> vnderstoode
that <em class="italic">Aluarados</em> shippe was in so great a leake that
with two pumpes they mighte not emptie the water,
he found no other remedy but to returne backe again to
<em class="italic">Acusamil</em> with al his fléet. The <em class="italic">Indians</em> of y<sup>t</sup> Ilande came
incontinent to y<sup>e</sup> water side very ioyfull, and to knowe
whether they had left any thing behind thē. The Christiās
enformed thē of their mishap, and came a shore, &#38; in
short time found the leake &#38; amended it. The Saterday
following they toke shipping again, al the army excepte
<em class="italic">Hernando Cortez</em>, and fiftie of his company, then the wind
arose contrary, and so much, that they could not departe
that day: &#38; the furie of the winde endured al that night,
but in the morning it waxed calme, so that they myghte
proceede on their voyage. But for as much as that was
the Sabboth daye, they determined to heare diuine seruice,
and after dinner to make saile. When their seruice
was ended, and <em class="italic">Cortez</em> sitting at his meate, there was
newes brought him that a little vessell called a <em class="italic">Canoa</em>,
came vnder saile toward the shippes, whiche seemed to
come from <em class="italic">Yucatan</em>: with that newes <em class="italic">Cortez</em> arose from
his meate, to behold whether the <em class="italic">Canoa</em> went, and perceiuyng
that she left the way toward the shippes, he sente
<em class="italic">Andrew de Tapia</em> with certaine others, as secrete &#38; closely
as might be deuised, to lye in ambushe for their comming
a shoare. The <em class="italic">Canoa</em> arriued in a calme place, out
of the which came foure men all naked, except their priuie
members, and the heare of their heades platted and
bound aboute their foreheades like vnto women, with
bowes and arrowes in their hands: three of them which
were <em class="italic">Indians</em>, wer afraide when they saw the Spaniards
with their drawen swordes, and would haue fled againe
to their <em class="italic">Canoa</em>, but the Christian feared not, and desired
his fellowes in the <em class="italic">Indian</em> tong to abide with hym. And
then he began to speake in the Spanish tongue in thys
wise: Maisters are ye Christians, yea (quoth they) and of
the Spanish nation. Then he reioyced so much, that the
teares fell from his eyes, and demaunded of them what
day it was, although he had a Primer wherein he dayly
prayed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The cōming of Aguilar to Cortez.</div>

<p>He then besought them earnestlye to assist him with
their prayers &#38; thanksgiuing vnto god for his deliuery,
&#38; kneling deuoutly downe vppon his knees, holding vp
his handes, his eyes toward heauen, and his face bathed
with teares, made his humble prayer vnto God, giuing
most hartie thankes, that it hadde pleased hym to deliuer
him out of the power of Infidels and infernal creatures,
and to place hym among Christians and men of
his owne nation. <em class="italic">Andrew de Tapia</em> holpe hym vppe, and
toke hym in hys armes, and so did al y<sup>e</sup> others embrace &#38;
louingly salute him. Then he commaunded the other
thrée <em class="italic">Indians</em> to follow him, and went talking wyth hys
friendes, where <em class="italic">Cortez</em> aboade, who receyued him ioyfully,
and gaue vnto hym such apparel as he néeded, and
wyth great pleasure hauing him in his companye, hee
demaunded the estate of his misfortune, and what was
hys name, who aunswered before them al, saying,
Sir my name is <em class="italic">Geronimo de Aguilar</em>, I was borne in
the Cittie of <em class="italic">Esija</em> in the <em class="italic">Andolozia</em>, and by misfortune
I was loste after this sorte. In the warres of
<em class="italic">Darien</em> and in the time of the contentions and passions of
<em class="italic">Iames de Nicuessa</em>, and <em class="italic">Vasco Nonez Balboa</em>, I came with
Captaine <em class="italic">Valdinia</em> in a little Caruell, toward <em class="italic">Santo Domingo</em>,
to giue aduice to the Admirall and gouernour, of
the troubles which had happned, and my comming was
for men and victuals: and likewise we brought twentye
thousand Duckettes of the kings in <em class="italic">Anno .1511.</em> And whē
we apported at <em class="italic">Iamayca</em>, our Caruel was lost on the shallowes
whiche were called the Vipars, and with greate
pain we entred (about twenty persons) into the boate, w<sup>t</sup>
out sayle, water or bread, and weake prouision of oares:
we thus wander thirtéene or fourtéene dayes, and then
the currant, whiche is there very great &#38; runneth alway
weastward, cast vs a shoare in a prouince called <em class="italic">Maija</em>, &#38;
traueling on our way, seauen of our fellowes died wyth
hunger &#38; famin. And captain <em class="italic">Valdinia</em> &#38; other 4. were sacrifised
to the ydols by a cruel and cursed <em class="italic">Cacike</em>, that is to
say, a Lord in whose power we fell .&#38;c.</p>

<p>And after the sacrifice, they were eaten among the <em class="italic">Indians</em>
for a solemne banket: and I, and other sixe wer put
into a Cage or coupe, to be fatned for an other sacrifice.
And for to escape suche abhominable death, we brake the
prison and fledde through certaine mountaines: So that
it pleased God that wee mette with another <em class="italic">Cazike</em> who
was enimy to him that first toke vs, his name was <em class="italic">Quinqus</em>,
a man of more reason and better condition, hee was
Lord of <em class="italic">Xamansana</em>: he accepted vs for his captiues, but
shortly after he dyed, and then I aboad with <em class="italic">Taxmar</em> his
heire. Then deceased other fiue of our fellowes, so that
there remayned but onely I and one <em class="italic">Gonsalo Guerrer</em>, a
maryner, who now abydeth with <em class="italic">Nachancan</em> the Lorde
of <em class="italic">Chetemal</em>, and he married with a rich gentlewoman of
that countrey, by whom he hath children, and is made a
Captaine, and wel estéemed with the <em class="italic">Cazike</em> for the victories
y<sup>t</sup> he hath had in the wars against the other Lords. I
sent vnto him your worships letter, desiring him that he
would come with me hauing so fit a passage, but he refused
my request, I belieue for verye shame, bycause hee
had his nose ful boared of holes, &#38; his eares iagged, hys
face &#38; handes painted according to the vse of y<sup>t</sup> countrey,
or else he abode there for the loue he bare to his wife and
children. All those whiche stoode by &#38; hard this Historie,
were amased, to heare <em class="italic">Geronimo de Aguilar</em> report howe
those <em class="italic">Indians</em> did sacrifise &#38; eate mans flesh. They also lamented
the miserie &#38; death of his fellowes, and highly
praysed God, to sée him frée frō his bondage &#38; from such
cruel &#38; barbarous people, &#38; to haue likewise so good an
enterpreter with thē, for vndoubtedly it semed a miracle
y<sup>t</sup> <em class="italic">Aluarados</em> ship fel into a leak, for with y<sup>t</sup> extremity they
returned back again to that Iland, wheras with contrarie
winde they were constrayned to abide y<sup>e</sup> cōming of
<em class="italic">Aguilar</em>. And certainly he was y<sup>e</sup> mean &#38; spéech of al their
procéedings. And therfore haue I bin so prolixious in y<sup>e</sup>
rehearsal of this matter, as a notable point of this historie.
Also I wil not let to tell how the mother of <em class="italic">Geronimo
de Aguilar</em>, became mad .&#38;c.</p>

<p>When she hard y<sup>t</sup> hir son was captiue among people y<sup>t</sup>
vsed to eate mās flesh, &#38; euer after whē she saw any flesh
spitted or roasted, she would make an open outcrie, saying,
oh I miserable woman, behold this is the flesh of my
dearebeloued sonne who was all my comfort.</p>

ten leagues in length &#38; thrée leagues in breadth, although
some say more, some lesse: it standeth twentye degrées on
this side the equator, and fiue leagues from the womēs
cape: it hath thrée villages, in y<sup>e</sup> which liueth nere 3 thousand
mē. The houses are of stone and brick, and couered
with straw &#38; bowes, &#38; some with tile. Their temples and
towers are made of lime &#38; stone very wel built: thei haue
no other fresh water but out of welles and raine water.
<em class="italic">Calachuni</em> is their chiefe Lord: they are browne people &#38;
goe naked: &#38; if any weare cloth, it is made of cotten wool
only to couer their priuie mēbers: they vse lōg hear platted

also <em class="italic">Maiz</em> which is for bread: also good fruites: &#38; hony, but
somewhat soure: and plots for bées, which contayn .1000

they saw our mē make cādels therof, they wōdred therat.
Their dogges haue Foxe faces and barke not, these they

&#38; at the feete of them, good pastures, many Deare,
and wilde Boares, Connyes and Hares, but they are not

prouide them of that victual, fresh salt and dried.
The people of this <em class="italic">Iland</em> are Idolaters, they doe sacrifice

The temple is like vnto a square Toure
broad at the foote, &#38; steps round about it,
&#38; from y<sup>e</sup> middest vpward very straight:
the top is hollow &#38; couered with straw:
it hath foure windowes with frontals
and galleries. In y<sup>t</sup> holow place is their
chappel, wheras their Idols do stand. The temple that
stoode by the sea side was such a one, in the which was a
maruellous straunge Idol, and differed muche from all
the rest, although they haue manye and of diuerse fashions.
The body of this Idol was great and hollow, and
was fastened in that wall with lime: hee was of earth.
And behinde this Idols backe was the Vesterie, where
was kept ornaments &#38; other things of seruice for y<sup>e</sup> temple.
The priests had a little secret dore hard adioyning to
y<sup>e</sup> Idol, by which dore they crept into y<sup>e</sup> hollow Idol, and
answered the people y<sup>t</sup> came with prayers &#38; peticiōs. And
w<sup>t</sup> this deceit y<sup>e</sup> simple soules beleued al y<sup>t</sup> the Idol spake,

swéete smelles, and offered bread and fruite, with sacrifice
of Quayles bloud, and other birds, and dogges, and sometime
mans bloud. And through the fame of this Idoll and
Oracle, many Pilgrimes came to <em class="italic">Acusamil</em> from many
places. At the foote of this Temple was a plotte like a
Churchyard, well walled and garnished with proper pinnacles,
in the middest whereof stoode a Crosse of ten
foote long, the which they adored for God of the rayne, for
at all times whē they wanted rayne, they would goe thither
on Procession deuoutely, and offered to the Crosse
Quayles sacrificed, for to appease the wrath that the
God séemed to haue agaynste them: and none was so acceptable
a sacrifice, as the bloud of that little birde. They
vsed to burne certaine swéete gūme, to perfume that God
withall, and to besprinckle it with water, and this done,
they beléeued assuredly to haue rayne. Suche is the Religiō

Shippes, who were armed with feathers, and suche lyke

They wondered not muche to sée oure Shyppes and

oares he entred the Riuer agaynste the streame, whiche
was verye greate, and hauyng rowen little more than

with loope holes to offende withall. And before oure

<em class="italic">Cortez</em> procéeded forwardes, and made vnto them signes

two Captaynes, whose names were <em class="italic">Alonso de
Auila</em>, and <em class="italic">Peter de Aluarado</em>, and to eache of them fiftie
menne. The same nyghte hée sente certayne Souldyers
wyth a sea compasse, to lye in ambushe in the
woodde whyche stoode betwéene the riuer and the towne,
for two considerations. The one, bycause the <em class="italic">Indians</em>
shoulde sée, that there were no moe Spanyardes in
the Ilande, than were the daye before. And the other
was, that hys menne hearing their watchword, shoulde
assaulte the towne on the land side. And as soone as the
day appeared, came eight boates of <em class="italic">Indians</em> armed, wheras
oure Campe was pitched, who broughte a little
victuall, saying they could get no more, bycause that the
inhabitantes of the Towne were fledde, with feare of
them, and their deformed vessels, desiring them to returne
aboorde their Shippes, and not to disquiet the people
of that Countrey. The interpreter aunswered, that
it was against humanitie to suffer them to perishe wyth
hunger, yea and if they woulde heare the cause of theyr
comming, they should shortly sée what profite would rebound
vnto them. The <em class="italic">Indians</em> replyed, that they woulde
take no counsell of straungers and menne whome they
knewe not. Lykewise, they thoughte not good to lodge
suche guestes in their houses, for they séemed terrible,
and such as would be commaunders. But if they woulde
néedes haue water, they mighte take riuer water, or else
make welles on the shore, for so dyd they at theyr néede.</p>

<p>Then <em class="italic">Cortez</em> séeyng that wordes preuayled not, hée
signifyed vnto them that he woulde enter their Towne
by force, to sée it and their Countrey, for to giue thereof
relation to the greatest Prince in the worlde, who hadde
sent them thither: requesting them to be therewith contented,
considering he meante not to disquiet them: and
if they would not permitte the same, he would commend
himselfe to his God, and to the strength and force of hys
men. The <em class="italic">Indians</em> aunswered agayne, that they shoulde
depart, and not thus bragge in other mens land, for in no
wise they woulde permitte them to enter their Towne.
And if with this warning they would not departe, they
meante to kyl both him and as many as were with him.
Yet <em class="italic">Cortez</em> ceassed not to vse all humanitie with those
barbarous people, according to the commaundemente
and instructions giuen vnto him by the King of <em class="italic">Castill</em>,
whiche was, to require those people oftentimes with
peace, before the attempting of warre, or entring perforce
into their Townes and Countrey, so that yet
agayne he conuited them with peace, promising them libertie
with good entertainement, assuring them of things
profitable both for body and soule, and that they myghte
accompt themselues happie with the knowledge thereof:
but if now they would refuse his offer, he did then warne
them to make them ready for the euening, for before the
going downe of the Sunne, he did hope with the help of
his God, to rest and take vp his lodging in the Towne,
in despite of all the inhabitants thereof, who had refused
his offer.</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">Indians</em> laughed at his talke, and skorning at him,
they returned to the Towne, to enforme their fellowes
of the pride and madnesse that they thought they hadde
hearde. Then the Spanyardes wente to dinner, and hauing
well refreshed themselues, they putte on their Armour,
and went aboorde their Boates and Vergantines,
looking for some aunswere from the <em class="italic">Indians</em>, and séeyng
the Sunne decline apace, and no aunswere, <em class="italic">Cortez</em> aduised
the Spanyardes that lay in ambushe in the woodde, to
giue assault, and he embarqued himselfe with his rapier
and Targette, gyuyng likewise assaulte with néere two
hundred men, who comming néere the Towne walles,
discharged his Ordinance, and lept into the water to the
knées, and began valiantly to assault the walles and bulwarkes.
The <em class="italic">Indians</em> séeyng their enimies so nigh vnto
them, beganne to fighte with courage, shooting arrowes,
throwing of dartes and stones, wherewith they hurte about
twenty Spanyardes: yea, and though the fearefull
noyse of the Ordinance did many times so annoy them,
being things so straunge, and neuer before séene of them,
yet they fledde not from the walles, but resisted the Christians
valiantlye, and suffered them not to enter the
Towne that way, if they had not bin assaulted in another
place. But when the Company that lay in ambush
hearde the shooting of their fellowes, they began likewyse
theyr onsette. The <em class="italic">Indians</em> knowyng nothyng what was
prepared behynde theyr backes, and hauing also theyr
handes full in defending the entrance by the Riuer: and
the Christians fyndyng that parte of the Towne without
resistance, entred in wyth a terrible noyse, killing as
many as they mette. Then the Townesmen vnderstoode
theyr oversyghte, and woulde haue remedyed it, and
fledde from the place where <em class="italic">Cortez</em> was gyuing combat,
whereby <em class="italic">Cortez</em> and hys Company entred the Towne
at ease, without contradiction, so that hée and the other
Companye of his Souldyers mette togither at the
Markette place, and expulsed all the <em class="italic">Indians</em> out of the
Towne, excepte those that were taken prisoners, and
the carkases of the deade. Then the Chrystians soughte
the spoyle, and founde nothyng but Turkie Hennes,
and some thyngs wrought of Cotten wooll, but verye
little Golde.</p>

<p>There was that daye aboue foure thousande <em class="italic">Indians</em>
in fyghte and defence of the Towne: There was much
<em class="italic">Indian</em> bloud shedde, bycause they fought naked, manye
were wounded, and fewe Captiue. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> lodged himselfe
wyth hys armie in the chiefest Temple of the Idolles,
where was roome sufficiente. They kepte that
nyghte good watche, as in a house of enimies, but the
poore <em class="italic">Indians</em> durst not once interrupte them. After
thys forte was <em class="italic">Potonchan</em> taken, béeyng the fyrste
Cytie that <em class="italic">Cortez</em> wanne by force in all hys Conquest.</p>

Al y<sup>t</sup> nighte <em class="italic">Cortez</em> slept not, but rather occupyed
himselfe in carrying the wounded
men, &#38; other stuffe aboord y<sup>e</sup> Shyps, &#38; also
to disenbarke thirtéene Horses, &#38; the residue
of his mē y<sup>t</sup> he had left aboord, y<sup>t</sup> which
he brought to passe before the sunne rising, although the
<em class="italic">Tauascans</em> had notice thereof. Whē the sunne was risen, he
had with his company made vnto God their prayers, and
mustered his men, where were at that time in Campe
néere fiue hundred Spanyardes, thirtéene Horses, and
sixe péeces of ordinance: These Horses were the fyrste
that euer came into that Countrey, whych now is called
new <em class="italic">Spayne</em>. He planted his men and munition in good order,
and thus marched forwardes toward <em class="italic">Cintla</em>. The <em class="italic">Indians</em>
séeyng this preparation, began also to make readie,
and to place in good order fortie thousand men in fyue cōpanies:
their méeting was in ploughed lande among manye
déepe lakes and pondes, very daungerous to passe,
so that our men by reason thereof were brought out of
order. And <em class="italic">Hernando Cortez</em> with his horsemen wente to
séeke a better passage, and to enclose himselfe among certayne
trées on their left hand, for to set vpon the enimies
when time should serue. The footemen procéeded on, and
passed many marishe groundes, vntill they came to the
tilled land. The <em class="italic">Indians</em> were expert in those places wher
they beganne the battayle, shooting with their bowes
and slings, and throwing of dartes. And although our mē
did some hurt among them with their Crossebowes, hādgunnes,
and Ordinance, whē they were in place to shoote,
yet the <em class="italic">Indians</em> pursued our men so thicke, that they could
not put them off, for by pollicie, the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Potonchan</em>
hadde soughte out that place: and it is to bée thoughte
that they were not barbarous, nor of small vnderstanding
in warres, yet notwithstanding wyth muche
payne, oure men gate out of that place, and obtayned another
somewhat better, and more playner grounde,
whereas they myghte vse their Ordinance, and fyghte
with their weapons bodye to body. But the <em class="italic">Indians</em> béeyng
so greate a number, draue our men to so narrowe a
place, that they were fayne to ioyne backe to backe
for theyr owne defence, yea &#38; for all that were in maruellous
greate daunger, for they hadde no roome to vse their
Ordinance, nor yet Horsemen to make them waye.
They béeyng in thys perplexitie, and readie to flye, suddaynely
appeared a Horseman with a speckled Horse,
whome they iudged to be Captayne <em class="italic">Morla</em>, whych Horsemanne
sette vppon the <em class="italic">Indians</em>, and made them retyre:
and hauyng more space than before, they sette afreshe
vppon the enimies, and slewe some of them. In thys
meane tyme the Horsemanne vaded away, and was
not séene, and wyth hys absence the <em class="italic">Indians</em> beganne afreshe,
and enclosed the Chrystians in the same daunger
that they were in before: then the Horsemanne appeared
agayne néere oure menne, and made maruellous
way among the enimies, wherevpon our menne séeyng
this succoure, gaue the onset agayne with great courage,
and slewe and hurt many <em class="italic">Indians</em>, but at the best season,
the Horseman vanished away cleane out of sighte, and
when the <em class="italic">Indians</em> sawe not the Horseman, with feare
of whome they fledde, thinkyng that he hadde bin a <em class="italic">Centaure</em>,
and that the Horse and man was all one incorporate,
they returned agayne with liueley courage, and vsed
our Christians worse than they hadde done before.
Then the Horseman returned the third time, and putte
the <em class="italic">Indians</em> to flight with great hurte, whom our footemē
pursued with great slaughter.</p>

<p>Now at this instant came <em class="italic">Cortez</em> with al his company
of horsemen, being wearied with the trauaile in passing
such strange lakes and wildernesse, wherof the countrey
is replenished. Our men being ioyful of his comming,
they began to enforme him what wonders they had sene
a horseman do, which came to succour them, demanding
of him which of their company it was. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> answered
and faithfully assured them, that it was none of their cōpany,
bicause it was not possible for any of them to come
any sooner: Then they al gaue God praise, belieuing that
it was a helpe sent from heauen. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> said (my deare
fellows) forwards, for god is with vs. Then the horsemē
set vpon the <em class="italic">Indians</em>, and with force of lance droue them
out of the marish ground, and brake their mayne battel.
The <em class="italic">Indians</em> incontinent left the fielde, and fled into the
thicke wooddes, the footemen followed them, and slue aboue
thrée hundred <em class="italic">Indians</em>, besides many other that were
hurt. There wer aboue seauenty Spaniardes wounded
with arrowes and stones.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A sodaine disease.</div>

<p>And whether it were with labour of the battel, or with
excessiue heate, or with drinking the water of that place,
there fel such a stitch in their loynes, that about a hūdred
of them fel flat vpon the groūd, not able to go nor stand,
their fellowes being forced to carry thē on their backes.
But it pleased god that the same night the payne wente
frō them, being in the morning wel againe. Who séeyng
themselues deliuered from so manye perils, gaue moste
humble thankes to the almightye god that had miraculously
deliuered them. They all agréed that thrée times
they had séene the straunge horseman, with the speckled
horse, fight in their fauour, as is aforesaid, beléeuing generally
it was a miracle, as certainely it did appeare, for
the Christians did not alone sée this thing, but also the
<em class="italic">Indians</em> dyd muche note it, for the maruelous fiercenesse
wherwith he came vppon them, with such great murder,
that they were amased, and almoste blynde with hys
bryghtnesse, being so trodden vnder hys féete. The
captiue <em class="italic">Indians</em> after the battayle declared the circumstance
therof.</p>

<em class="italic">Cortez</em> released some of hys
prisoners and sent them to
their Lorde, saying that it
grieued him the hurt done
on both parties, but the
fault was theirs. And that
god was witnesse of hys
innocencie and also of hys
curtesie offered vnto thē.
But notwithstanding all
that was paste, he pardoned
their errour with suche condition, That if in continent
or within two dayes, theyr Lorde woulde come
vnto him, to yéelde satisfaction of their malice and
stubbornesse, and to treate of peace and friendship, warning
and aduising them, that if they came not wythin
the time appointed, hee woulde enter into his countrey,
burning and spoyling with slaughter both great &#38;
smal, armed and vnarmed: with which message the messengers
departed, and <em class="italic">Cortez</em> returned to the towne to
cure his wounded men. The next day came fiftie auncient
Indians to craue pardon for their offence, and also
licence to bury the dead, with likewise safeconduct that
their rulers and principal persons myght safely come
vnto the towne. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> graunted their request, warning
them to make any lyes or yet to conspire againe: and also
if their lords came not personally, he would not heare
any more embassadors: with this rigorous cōmaūdemēt
&#38; protestation they departed. These <em class="italic">Indians</em> féeling their
strength woulde not preuaile, thinking the christians to
be inuincible, their Lords and chiefest persons did determine
to goe and visite the christians and their captaine.
And according to the time appointed, the Lorde of that
town and other foure Lords his neyghbours came vnto
<em class="italic">Cortez</em> with a good trayne of their vessals and seruitours,
and presented vnto him, bread, turkie hennes, &#38; fruites,
with other like prouision for his host, with four hundred
pieces of gold of y<sup>e</sup> value of 400. double duckets, w<sup>t</sup> other
small iewels, and certaine turkie stones of small value.
And twentie women slaues, to serue to make breade and
dresse meate for y<sup>e</sup> whole army. He craued and beseeched
<em class="italic">Cortez</em> to pardon his former offence. And to accept and
receiue them into hys friendshippe. And in token of his
obedience, hee and his fellowes dyd willinglye deliuer
their bodies, landes and goods into his handes and
power. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> did louingly receiue them, and gaue vnto
them certaine trifles of his wares, whiche they estéemed
much. And those <em class="italic">Indians</em> hearing the horses and mares
ney, they maruelled at their neying, thinking that the
horses could speake, &#38; demaunded of the Christians what
they sayd, (mary quoth they) these horses are sore offended
with you bycause ye fought with them, &#38; wold haue

Many things passed betweene our men &#38;
the <em class="italic">Indians</em>: for where the <em class="italic">Indians</em> vnderstood
thē not, their behauiour was much
to laugh at. And vsing conuersation with
our men, &#38; seeing they receiued no hurte
of them, they brought to the towne their
wiues and children, which were no smal number. And among
many matters that <em class="italic">Cortez</em> communed with <em class="italic">Tauasco</em>
by the mouth of <em class="italic">Ieronimo de Aguila</em> his enterpreter:</p>

<p>The first question was: Whether there wer mynes of
gold or siluer in that countrey, and from whēce they had
that small quantitye that they hadde broughte vnto them?</p>

<p>The secōd question was: Why they denyed him their
friendshippe, more than the other captaine that had bin
there the yeare before?</p>

<p>The third was: Why they being so many in nūber,
fled from them being so fewe?</p>

<p>The fourth was: To giue thē to vnderstād the mightie
power of the king of Castill. And last of all to giue
them knowledge of the faith of Iesu Christ.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The ansvvere of the Cacike.</div>

<p>As touching Sir (quoth he) the Mynes of gold and
siluer in our country, we séeke for none, for we séeke not
after treasure and riches, but we procure and desire a
quiet life. And that golde which we haue, was founde
by chaunce: for we know not what Mynes do mean. Yet
notwithstanding further within the lande, whereas the
sunne doth hide himselfe, ther the people do finde muche
gold and are giuen to séeke the same.</p>

<p>And as touching the captaine that was here of late,
we seeing the men and shippes to be such as we had neuer
before seene, spake vnto them and demaunded
what they would haue, they sayde that their comming
was, to chaunge their merchandice for gold and nothyng
else, wherefore we graunted to their request. But now
séeing greater vessels and moe in number, wee feared
least ye came to take our substance. And I knowing my
selfe nothing inferiour to any of my neyghbours, would
not permit any iniurie to be offered me, and that he and
his subiectes did estéeme themselues the most valiant of
men of warre in all these parties, and that none durste
take away their goods, women, and children, to be sacrificed
by force, wherevpon he thought to withstande those
fewe Christians, but (quoth he) I founde my selfe deceiued,
seeyng we could not kill any of your companye.
And likewise the brightnesse of youre weapons dyd
blynde vs, and the woundes you made were incurable.</p>

<p>But the noyse and lightning of your ordinance dyd
more amase vs, than either thunder-clappes or tempest:
and also the great spoyle that you made among vs therwith:
likewise your straunge horses made vs greatly to
wonder, to behold their open mouthes, wee feared to be
swallowed. And then to consider their swiftnesse in running,
we knew no creature could escape them. But y<sup>e</sup> first
horse that fought with vs, put vs in marueylous feare,
being but one, but when we espyed many, then all oure
helpe was past, for we belieued that the horse and man
was al one incorporate.</p>

With the relation of <em class="italic">Tauasco</em>, <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
sawe that the countrey was not
for Spaniardes, nor yet he toke
it a thing conueniente to settle
themselues where no golde nor
siluer was, or other riches. And so
pretended to passe forwardes to
discouer westward the lande endewed
with golde. But before his departure, he declared
to those new conquered <em class="italic">Indians</em>, that the Lord in whose
name he and hys company had taken that iourney was
king of Spayne and Emperour of Christians, and the
greatest Prince in the worlde, vnto whom many kings
and Princes dyd homage and obey. And that hys rule
and gouernemente in iustice proceeded from God, beeing
iust, holy, peaceable, and sweete, and also the <em class="italic">Monarchie</em>
of the vniuersall did appertaine vnto him. And for
these causes he required them to yelde themselues as his
subiectes. And if they would doe so, there shoulde ensue
vnto them great profite, lawes and pollicie. And as touching
their religion, he declared their blindnesse &#38; greate
abuses which they vsed in worshipping many Gods, and
in making sacrifice vnto them with mans bloud, yea &#38;
thinking that those images and Idols, did or coulde doe
good or euill vnto them, being dūbe, without life or soule,
yea and y<sup>e</sup> worke of their owne hands. He certifyed them
of one god maker of heauen and earth, and all creatures
whom the Christians did worshippe and serue, and that
all creatures ought to doe the same. In conclusion with
thys doctryne they brake downe their Idols, and receyued
the crosse, <em class="italic">Cortez</em> hauing first declared vnto them the
great miseries that the son of God suffered on y<sup>e</sup> Crosse
for mankynde. And in the greatest temple of <em class="italic">Potonchan</em>,
set vp a Crosse in remēbrance of the death of Christ and
celebrated the feast vpon their knees, and the multitude
of <em class="italic">Indians</em> likewise, and departed to their meate. <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
desired them within two dayes to come agayne to
theyr diuine seruice. And that day was Palme sunday.
And so they did and brought an infinite number of men
women and children of other villages with them whych
was straunge to behold. And there generally gaue theyr
vassalship to the king of Spaine into the handes of <em class="italic">Hernando
Cortez</em>, with protestation of perpetuall friendship
with the Spanish nation. So that these were the fyrste
vassals that the Emperour had in the new Spayne. And
this feast and ceremony ended, our men toke shipping
with the palme boughes in their handes. In this doyng
<em class="italic">Cortez</em> deserued no lesse prayse than in his victorie, for he
vsed wisedome with manhoode in all his doings: he lefte
those <em class="italic">Indians</em> with a newe faith, and the towne frée and
without hurt, he toke none for slaues, nor yet any spoyle
nor exchāged his merchaundice for any thing although
he aboade there twentye dayes. The towne is called in
the <em class="italic">Indian</em> tongue <em class="italic">Potonchan</em>, that is to saye, a place
that stincketh, and our menne named it, the victorie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The armor of the Indians.</div>

<p>The Lord (as ye haue heard) was called <em class="italic">Tauasco</em>, and
therefore the firste Spaniardes that came thyther, named
the riuer <em class="italic">Tauasco</em>, but <em class="italic">Grijalua</em> called it after hys

soone be forgotten. And truely all those that do discouer

names. This town doth containe neare fiue and twentye
thousand houses (as some say) but as euery house stādeth
by himselfe like an Iland, it seemeth much bigger than
it is in déede. The houses are great, made of lime stone, &#38;
bricke: others there are made of mood wal, and rafters &#38;
couered with straw or bordes. Their dwelling is in the
vpper part of the house, for the greate moystnesse of the
riuers and lakes, and for feare of fier, they haue theyr
houses separated the one from the other. Without, the
towne they haue more fairer houses than wythin for
their recreation and pleasure. They are browne people,
and go almost naked, and eat mans flesh sacrificed. Their
weapons are bowes and arrowes, slyngs, darts, and lances.
The armour wherwith they defend themselues, are
Targets and skulles made of woodde or barke of trées,
and some of gold very thinne. They haue also a certayne

Shyppe, gyuyng them thankes for theyr paynes and
visitation. Hée made vnto them a banket of Wyne and
Conserua, and sayde vnto them, that the nexte day followyng
hee would come alande, and talke with the
Gouernoure, whome hée besoughte not to alter him nor
hys people wyth hys commyng a shore, for he meant not
to molest hym, but rather to pleasure and profyte hym.
To that these messengers were rewarded wyth certayne
gyftes, they eate and dranke, but yet suspected
euill, although they lyked the Wyne well, wherefore
they desired to haue thereof, and also of the Conserua,
to presente vnto theyr Lorde, whyche was giuen them,
and so departed.</p>

<p>The nexte daye béeyng good Friday, <em class="italic">Cortez</em> came
alande wyth hys Boates full of menne, and broughte
hys Horses and artillerie a shore by little and little,
wyth all hys menne of warre, and two hundred <em class="italic">Indians</em>
of <em class="italic">Cuba</em>, whyche serued to toyle and laboure.
Hée planted hymselfe in the best scituation that hée
coulde fynde among the Sandy bankes on the Sea
syde, and there pytched hys Campe, and hauyng
néere that place manye trées, they builte them Cotages
with boughes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A straunge salutation.</div>

<p>From a little Village that was at hand, came many
<em class="italic">Indians</em> to gaze at things so straunge, and the like neuer
séene vnto them, and brought with thē gold to barter for
suche toyes, as the two little Boates had broughte from
them before. They brought also bread and meate readie
dressed after their vse likewise to sell. Oure men chaunged
wyth them beadestones of glasse, looking glasses,
sissers, kniues, pinnes, and suche other wares, whereof
the <em class="italic">Indians</em> were not a little glad, returning home to
their houses, shewing their neighbours. The ioy and
pleasure that these simple soules tooke with these trifles,
was so greate, that the next day they came agayne wyth
other <em class="italic">Indians</em> ladē with Iewels of gold, Turkie Hennes,
bread, meate, and fruite, that suffised for all the Campe,
and for the same they receyued nedels, and beadestones
of glasse, but the poore soules thought themselues therewith
so riche, that they knewe not where they were
with ioy and pleasure, yea and they thoughte that they
hadde deceyued the Straungers. Nowe <em class="italic">Cortez</em> séeyng
the greate quantitie of golde broughte and bartered so
foolishly for trifles of no valewe, proclaymed throughout
all hys host, that no Christian shoulde take any golde
vppon greate penaltie, and that they shoulde all shewe,
as though they knewe not to what purpose the golde
serued, and that they passed not for it, bycause they
shoulde not thynke that the desire thereof had broughte
them thyther, and so they did dissemble that great demonstration
of golde, to sée what was meante thereby,
and whether the <em class="italic">Indians</em> hadde brought that golde, to
proue whether theyr commyng was for that or no. On
Easter day in the morning, came <em class="italic">Teudilli</em> the Gouernour
to the Campe, from <em class="italic">Cotosta</em> hys dwellyng place, whyche
was eyght leagues from thence. He brought attendyng
vpon his person foure thousande men without weapon,
and the most part well clothed, some of them with garments
of Cotton, riche after their manner. And others
naked, laden with victuals in great abundance, whiche
was straunge to sée. <em class="italic">Teudilli</em> according to their vsance,
did his reuerence to the Captaine, burning frankinsence,
and little strawes touched in bloud of his owne bodye,
he presented vnto him the victuals, and certayne Iewels
of golde very riche and well wrought, and other things
made of feathers very curious straunge and artificiall.
<em class="italic">Cortez</em> embraced him in his armes, and receyued hym
ioyfully, saluting all hys company. He gaue to <em class="italic">Teudilli</em> a
coate of silke, a brooche, and a coller of glasse, with many
other péeces of Haberdashe wares, whiche was highly
estéemed of him.</p>

Al the former talke was had without
an Interpreter, bycause <em class="italic">Ieronimo de

bycause it differed muche from
the spéeche of the other <em class="italic">Indians</em>, whereas
hée hadde bin captiue: for whyche
cause <em class="italic">Cortez</em> was somewhat carefull,
bicause he would largely haue discoursed with <em class="italic">Teudilli</em>. It
chanced that among those twentie women giuen hym
in <em class="italic">Potonchan</em>, one of them stoode talking with a seruaunte
of <em class="italic">Teudilli</em>, bycause she vnderstoode them as menne of hir

and promised hir more than libertie, so that she woulde
bée a trustie and faithfull interpreter betwixte hym and
those <em class="italic">Indians</em>, and that hée woulde estéeme hir as his Secretarie.
And further demanded of hir of what lignage
she was, then she aunswered, that she was naturall of
the Countrey that bordered vpō <em class="italic">Xalixco</em>, and of a towne
called <em class="italic">Viluto</em>, daughter vnto riche parentes, and of the
kinrede of the Lorde of that lande. And béeyng a little
girle, certayne Merchantes dyd steale hir away in tyme

whyche is a greate Towne néere <em class="italic">Coasaqualco</em>, not
farre distant from <em class="italic">Tauasco</em>: and after this sorte shée came
to the power of the Lord of <em class="italic">Potonchan</em>. This woman was
Christened <em class="italic">Marina</em>. She and hir fellowes were the firste

<p>Nowe <em class="italic">Cortez</em> béeyng assured of hys true Interpreters,
hée celebrated hys accustomed deuine seruice, and <em class="italic">Teudilli</em>
wyth hym, and after they hadde dyned in <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
hys Tente in presence of many <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em> and <em class="italic">Indians</em>,
<em class="italic">Cortez</em> enformed <em class="italic">Teudilli</em> howe that hée was vassall to
the Lord <em class="italic">Charles</em> of <em class="italic">Austria</em> Emperour of the Christiās,
and King of <em class="italic">Spayne</em>, and Lorde ouer a greate parte of
the worlde, whome great Kings and Princes dyd serue
and obey: and that all Princes were glad to bée hys
friendes for his Vertue and myghte. And hée hauyng
aduertisemente of that Countrey and Lorde thereof,
had sente him thyther to visite hym on hys behalfe, and
to enforme hym of certayne secrete matters, the effecte
whereof he hadde in wrytyng. Sir (quoth <em class="italic">Teudilli</em>,) I am
very glad to heare the Maiestie and Vertue of the Emperoure
youre maister, but you shall vnderstande,
that my Lorde the Emperoure <em class="italic">Melzuma</em> is as greate
and as good a Prince as he. And I doe muche maruell,
that there shoulde bée anye so greate a Prince in the
whole worlde, but yet according to youre request, I
wyll certifye hym, and knowe hys pleasure, for I
trust (quoth he) in the clemencie of my Prince, that
youre newes and message shall bée acceptable vnto him,
and you well recompensed for your paynes. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> then
commaunded al his men to set themselues in order of battayle
with fife and drumme, and to skirmishe before <em class="italic">Teudilli</em>.
And that the horsemen shoulde runne, and the ordinaunce
shotte of, to the entent that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> shoulde
be aduertised thereof. The <em class="italic">Indians</em> did much beholde the
gesture, apparell and beardes of our men, they wondered
to sée the horses runne, they feared the brightnesse of the
swordes, and at the noyse of the ordinaunce they fell flatte
to the ground, thinking that the heauens did fall. And the
shippes, they held opinion was the God of the ayre called
<em class="italic">Quezalcoualt</em>, whiche came with the temples on his backe,
for they dayly looked for him. <em class="italic">Teudilli</em> dispatched the poste
to <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, to <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, aduising him of all that he had
séene, and demaunded golde of him for to giue vnto the
Captayne of that newe people. Bicause <em class="italic">Cortez</em> had inquired
of him, whether <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> had gold or no, he answered
(yes) mary quoth <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, I and my fellowes haue a
certayne disease of the harte, and golde helpeth vs. This
message wente from the campe to <em class="italic">Mexico</em> in one day and
a night, whiche is 210. myle, and the poste caried paynted
the horses and horsemen vpon them, the maner of theyr
armour, and howe many péeces of ordinaunce they had, &#38;
what number of bearded men there were: and as for the
shippes he had giuē aduise as soone as they arriued, shewing
the greatnesse and quantitie of them. All these things
aforesayde, <em class="italic">Teudilli</em> caused to be paynted in cloth of Cotten
very liuely, that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> mought sée it. The cause that
this message wente so farre in so shorte a space, was, they
had certayne places that postes attended, as we may say
horsepostes which gaue alwayes from hand to hande the
paynted cloth: they doe runne on foote faster in this sorte,
than by horsepost, and is more of antiquitie than horsepost:
Also <em class="italic">Teudilli</em> sent to <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> the garments &#38; many
other things whiche <em class="italic">Cortez</em> had giuen him, whiche things
were after wardes founde in the treasorie of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>.</p>

After the message sente, and the answere
promised, <em class="italic">Teudilli</em> tooke his leaue, and within
twoo flight shoote of <em class="italic">Cortez</em> his campe, he
caused a thousande cotages of boughes to
be made, &#38; lefte there twoo principall men
as Captaynes ouer two thousande persons men and women,
and then departed for <em class="italic">Cotosta</em> hys dwellyng place.
The twoo Captaynes had charge to prouide the Christians
of all things necessarie, and the women serued to
grynde their corne and make bread of <em class="italic">Maiz</em>, and to
dresse theyr fishe and flesh and other victuals, and the men
serued to carrie the dressed meate to the Christians cāpe,
and wood, water, &#38; grasse for the horses and al other necessaries,
and this they passed eight dayes. In this meane
season returned the poste with a riche and gentle present,
whiche was many couerlets and clothes of cotton, white,
and of other colours wrought, many tuffes of feathers
very fayre, and some things wrought with golde and fethers,
quantitie of Iewels and péeces of golde and siluer,
twoo thinne whéeles, the one of siluer whiche wayde .25.
markes with the signe of the Moone, and the other whéele
of golde which wayed a hundreth markes, made like vnto
the Sunne, with many leaues and beasts, a very curious
péece of worke: these twoo things they helde for Gods in
that countrey, &#38; giueth thē the colours of the metall that
is likest thē, euery whéele was two yardes &#38; a half broade,
and so proportionally in compasse round aboute, this present
was estéemed at 20900. Ducates. This present shold
haue bene giuen to <em class="italic">Grijalua</em>, if he had not so soone departed
as the <em class="italic">Indians</em> reported. He also gaue vnto <em class="italic">Cortez</em> this answere,
that <em class="italic">Mutezumas</em> his Lorde was very gladde to
know, &#38; to be friend to suche a mighty Prince as the king
of Spayne was, and that in his time should arriue in his
countrey such new people, &#38; the like neuer séene before, &#38;
that he was readie to shew them al pleasure &#38; honour, requesting
him to sée what things he stoode in néede of for y<sup>e</sup>
time that he meant to abide there, as well for himselfe as
for his ships, army and deceasse, and it should be prouided
abundantly: yea &#38; also if he could finde any thing in that
countrey to his contentment, to present to the Emperour
of Christians, he would willingly prouide it. And as touching
the desire that <em class="italic">Cortez</em> had to come to visite &#38; to haue
cōmunication with him, he thought it vnpossible, bycause
that he was sickly and could not come vnto the sea coast,
and likewise for <em class="italic">Cortez</em> to come where he did abide, it was
harde, troublesome and difficill, as well for the many and
cragged mountaynes, as also the countrey, wilde, desert &#38;
without habitation, and shoulde be constrayned to suffer
hunger, thirst, and other necessitie: and moreouer the enhabitaunts
of much part of the way that he should passe,
were his enimies, both cruell &#38; cursed people, and knowing
thē to be his friendes, they should not escape with life.</p>

<p>All these excuses did <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> by the mouth of <em class="italic">Teudilli</em>
declare vnto <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, thinkyng to driue him frō his purpose
&#38; pretēded iourney, alleaging the foresayd difficulties
and perils, the <em class="italic">Indians</em> did also hope that with some cōtrary
weather they should be forced to leaue that coast &#38; coūtrey.
Notwithstāding this cōtradiction, so much the more
desire had <em class="italic">Cortez</em> to visite <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, who was so great a
prince in that parties, &#38; throughly to discouer the treasure
which he imagined to be there. And hauing receiued y<sup>e</sup> present,
&#38; also y<sup>e</sup> answer, he gaue vnto <em class="italic">Teudilli</em> a garmēt of his
owne wearyng, and many other trifles of his Haberdash,
to be sente vnto <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, saying that if it were for no
other purpose but onely to sée so mightie and vertuous a
Prince, it should be requisite and iuste to trauayle vnto
his Court, how much the more, he was of duetie cōstrayned
to doe the Embassage which the Emperour of Christians
had willed and commaunded him to doe, for otherwyse
he shoulde incurre the displeasure of the King his
mayster, wherefore he besought <em class="italic">Teudilli</em> yet once agayne
to aduertise <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> of his constant determination, bycause
hée shoulde vnderstande that he would not leaue off
hys pretended purpose for any inconuenience that was
obiected vnto him. Alleagying moreouer, that he who had
cōmen 2000. leagues by sea, mought well goe 70. leagues
by lande, and consideryng that he had many at his charge
with small prouision, and likewise his shippes in daunger,
he required that with all expedition the messengers
should be dispatched. <em class="italic">Teudilli</em> desired him to recreate himself,
&#38; not to take any grief, for as much as he himself did
dayly aduertise <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> of his procéedings, euen so
with all expedition the full resolution should come from
<em class="italic">Mexico</em>, although it were somewhat farre off. And as for
his victuals, he shoulde take no care, for abundantly he
should be prouided. And also desired him for so much as he
was not well placed among those sandy bankes, that it
might please him to goe with him to certayne townes aboute
sixe or seuen leagues frō thence. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> refused that
offer, wherevpon <em class="italic">Teudilli</em> departed, and he abode there ten
dayes looking for answere from <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>.</p>

In this meane season certayne <em class="italic">Indians</em>
were espied, that went lurkyng a farre of
among the sandy hilles. And those came
not neare the <em class="italic">Indians</em>, that serued the
Spaniarde, <em class="italic">Cortez</em> demaunded what people
they were, &#38; for what cause they went
lurkyng so farre off, and came no néerer vnto them.</p>

<p>The twoo Captaynes answered, that they were husbandmen,
that went aboute theyr husbandry. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> lyked
not theyr answere, but suspected that they had tolde
hym a lye: for it séemed vnto hym that those people desired
to come among the Christians, and that they durste
not with feare of the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Teudilli</em>, and so it was in
very déede. For all that coaste and mayne lande within,
as farre as <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, was full of the newes and straunge
things that our men had done in <em class="italic">Potonchan</em>. Wherefore
they all desired to sée them and to talke with them, but
they durste not for feare of the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Culhua</em>, who
are subiectes vnto <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, wherevpon <em class="italic">Cortez</em> sente
fiue Spaniardes to call them with signes and tokens of
peace. This company of <em class="italic">Indians</em> were in number twentie,
and were gladde to beholde those fiue men commyng
towardes them, and were desirous to sée suche straunge
people and shippes, wherefore they came willingly altogither
vnto <em class="italic">Cortez</em> his Tente.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Indiās attyre.</div>

<p>These <em class="italic">Indians</em> dyd differ muche from all the other
<em class="italic">Indians</em> yet séene, for they were hygher of person, and
had the grystels of theyr noses slitte, hangyng ouer their
mouths, and rings of Iette and Amber hanging thereat.
They had also theyr neither lippes bored, and in the holes
rings of golde and turky stones, whiche wayed so muche,
that their lippes hanged downe ouer theyr chinnes, and
their téeth remayned bare: The whiche custome although
they vsed for a brauery, it séemed a foule and vgly sighte
in the Spanyardes eyes, and very lothsome.</p>

<p>The other <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, had theyr lippes
and eares bored, with rounde stones hangyng at the
iagges thereof, yet they had not suche foule slittes in
their noses, but they had suche bored holes that a manne
myght put any finger of his hande through them, with
rings of golde and stone hanging thereat, the euill fauoured
sighte of their faces made our men to muse.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> communed with them by hys interpreter <em class="italic">Marina</em>,
to knowe from whence they were, they answered,
that they were dwellers in <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em>, a Cittie distant
from thence one dayes iourney, situated vpon a riuer side,
and bordered vpon the Countrey of <em class="italic">Mutezumazin</em>, and
that their <em class="italic">Cazique</em> or Lorde had sente them, to sée what
Goddes were comen in those <em class="italic">Teucallis</em>, that is to say,
Temple, saying, also that they durste not come sooner, not
knowyng what people they were.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> made muche of them and shewed a chéerefull
countenaunce vnto them, for they séemed very bestiall,
he declared vnto them that he was gladde of theyr commyng,
and to knowe the good will that theyr Lorde bare
vnto him, and gaue them Haberdashe toyes, and shewed
them the Horses and Armour, a straunge sighte for
them. And so they wente through the army lookyng and
gasing here and there as menne amazed. And in all the
tyme they abode there, they vsed no conuersation with
the other <em class="italic">Indians</em>. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> enquired of <em class="italic">Maryna</em> the cause
thereof, and shée sayde that those menne did not onely
speake an other languague, but also did appertayne to
another Lorde, who was not vassall to <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, but by
force and extortion.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> was very gladde of that newes, for hée coniectured
by the talke of <em class="italic">Teudilli</em> that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> had
warres and enimies, wherevppon hée tooke aside thrée
of those <em class="italic">Indians</em> whiche séemed moste wysest, and demaunded
of them by <em class="italic">Maryna</em> what Lordes there were
in that Countrey: they answered that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> was
Lorde ouer all, although in euery Cittie and Prouince
was a Lorde, yet neuerthelesse all in generall dyd paye
tribute and serue him as vassals, nay rather lyke slaues.
But yet many of them of late dayes did reknowledge
hym by force of armes, and payde vnto him suche tolle
and tribute that they were not accustomed to pay, of
whiche number their Lorde of <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em> was one of
them, and other his neyghbours, who many tymes helde
him warre to be frée from his tiranny and bondage, but
yet sayde they, it preuayled not, for his hoste was greate
and his warriers valiant.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> receyued greate pleasure to finde in that countrey
dissention and discorde among some Noble menne,
and at deuision among themselues, thynking thereby
the better to bryng his purpose to passe. He gaue thanks
vnto those <em class="italic">Indians</em> for their aduise, offeryng vnto them
his fauour, helpe and friendshippe, praying them to come
often to his campe, and so tooke his leaue of them, with
his commendations to their Lorde, and sente him certayne

At the ende of tenne dayes came <em class="italic">Teudilli</em>
backe againe, and brought certaine cloth
of Cotten, and other things made of feathers
well wrought for recompence of
the thyng sente vnto <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and warned

there was no remedie to sée <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, and to looke what
was necessary for his prouision and furniture, and it
shoulde be prouided, offeryng the same seruice at any time
that hée shoulde happen to come that way. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> would
not accept the offer, saying: That he would not departe

with <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>. The gouernour <em class="italic">Teudilli</em> yet agayne replied,
that he shoulde not contende therein, and with those
wordes departed from hym. The nexte night followyng
he with all those <em class="italic">Indians</em> as well men as women whiche
attended to serue and prouide the Spanishe campe, wente
from thence: so that in the mornyng all the cotages were
emptie, where those seruitors had bene.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> suspecting this alteratiō prouided himselfe with
preparation for battayle, &#38; finding the matter contrary to
his expectation, he deliberated to séeke a sure roade or harbor
for his nauie, &#38; also a good plotte or situation to buylde
vpon, for then he fully meant to obtayne perpetuitie &#38; to
conquere the lande, considering y<sup>t</sup> he had found such great
tokens of gold, plate, &#38; other riches, &#38; thereaboute within
a whole league cōpasse was no fit place for y<sup>e</sup> purpose: for
why? all was sandy ground, &#38; such as tossed too &#38; fro with

In consideration wherof he sent <em class="italic">Francisco de Monteio</em>,
with two vergantines, and fiftie men, to runne along the
coast, vntill they should finde some reasonable poart and
good scituation to build vpon.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Monteio</em> procéeded on his voyage, and sayled in sighte
of lande, vntill he came to <em class="italic">Panuco</em>, withoute finding anye
port or harbor, sauing the shadowe of a Rocke, whyche
stoode somewhat distant from the land a sea boord, so that
at thrée wéekes ende he returned backe agayne with the
foresayde newes. Hauing runne so little a way, he fell into
suche terrible currants, that although he made waye
wyth oares and sayles, yet the sayde Currant forced hym
backe agayne. Also he broughte newes, that the <em class="italic">Indians</em>
of that coast did let themselues bloud, offering the same
vnto them vpon little strawes, in token of friendship or
deitie.</p>

<p>The relation of <em class="italic">Monteio</em> contented not <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, yet
notwithstandyng he pretended to goe to the shade or
succoure of the Rocke, bycause hée was enformed, that
néere that place, was two fayre Riuers, wyth store
of wooddes, necessarye for tymber and fyre woodde,
greate quantitie of stones to builde with, fayre pastures,
and ground for tyllage, although the harbour was not
sufficiente for hys Nauie and contratation, bycause that
roade was without defence, and open vppon the Northe,
which is the winde that most ruleth with greatest hurte
vpon that coast.</p>

<p>And also considering that <em class="italic">Teudilli</em> and hys menne
were departed, fearing also the want of victuals, and
likewise, that hys Shyppes myghte perishe vppon the
shore, he commaunded to lade aboorde all theyr stuffe,
and hée wyth foure hundred menne, and all his Horses,
followed on the hygh way that the <em class="italic">Indians</em> hadde
gone.</p>

<p>After hée hadde iourneyed thrée leagues, hée came to
a fayre vadeable Riuer, and passing ouer the Riuer, hée
found a towne not inhabited, for the inhabitantes thereof
were fledde with feare: he entred into a great house,
which séemed the place of the Lorde of the Towne, built
with timber and earthen walles, the foundation whereof
was raysed with handie worke, about a fadome high: the
roofe was couered with strawe, but of a fayre &#38; strange
workemanshippe inwardes, with many greate pertitions,
some full of pottes of honey, and Maiz, with other
grayne whiche they kéepe in store all the yeare: other
roomes had cloth of Cotten wool, wrought with feathers,
golde and siluer.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> commaunded Proclamation to be made, that
none of his company shoulde take any thyng away, vppon
payne of deathe (onely victuals excepted) to the intente
to obtayne the good will and friendship among the
<em class="italic">Indians</em>.</p>

<p>There was in that Village a Temple, whiche hadde
a little Tower with a Chappell on the toppe, and twentie
steppes to come vnto the Chappell, where they found
some Idolles, and many bloudy papers, and much mans
bloud of those which hadde bin sacrificed, as <em class="italic">Marina</em> dyd
certifie.</p>

<p>They found also the blocke wherevppon they vsed to
cutte open the menne sacrificed, and the razors made of
Flint, wherewyth they opened their breastes, and plucked
out their heartes béeyng aliue, throwing them vppe
toward Heauen as an offering, and after this done, they
annoynted their Idolles, and the papers they offered, and
then burned them.</p>

<p>This sight put a great compassion, yea and a feare among
our <em class="italic">Spanyards</em>, who did beholde these things. From
this Village they went to other thrée or foure, and found
none aboue two hundred houses, and all without people,
yet well prouided with victuall, as the firste towne was.
<em class="italic">Cortez</em> returned from thence to discharge his Shippes,
and to take order to sende for moe men: and with desire
to beginne habitation, in these affaires he occupyed hymselfe
tenne dayes.</p>

When <em class="italic">Cortes</em> was come where his Ships
were, and the residue of his company, hée
began this talke, saying:</p>

<p>Now my louing friends and fellowes,
ye doe sée what greate mercy God hathe
shewed vnto vs, in bringing vs safe and
in health to so good and riche a Countrey, as by manifest
signes and tokens we haue alreadye séene, yea and howe
plentifull of meate, inhabited of people, better clothed,
and of more iudgement and reason, than the others whiche
ye haue séene, since your firste comming: also better
buildings, fieldes of grayne and corne: yea and it is to be
thought, that the things not yet séene, doe surmount all
that hithervnto ye haue playnely séene. Wherefore wée
ought to giue most hartie thankes vnto God, and to beginne
oure habitation héere, whereas we shall enioy the
grace and mercy of God. And to bryng this matter to
passe, me thinke best that we abide héere, vntill we may
finde a better port or scituation. Also that we make a
wall or Castell for oure defence, if néede shoulde happen,
for the people of this land hath little ioy of our comming
and abiding héere.</p>

<p>It was then considered that frō that place they might
the sooner haue friendshippe and contractation with the
<em class="italic">Indians</em> and Townes nexte adioyning, as <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em>,
and others whyche were enimies to <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
and béeyng in this order once placed, they myghte
discharge their Shyppes, and sende them incontinent to
<em class="italic">Cuba</em>, <em class="italic">Santo Domingo</em>, <em class="italic">Iamayca</em>, <em class="italic">Borriquen</em>, and other Ilandes,
or else to <em class="italic">Spayne</em> for more men, armour and Horsses,
and for clothing and victuals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Policie.</div>

<p>Moreouer, it was thought iust and méete, to sende relation
of all their procéedings to the Emperoure theyr
King and maister, with the demonstration of golde, syluer,
and other riches, which they had in their power.</p>

<p>And bycause all these things should be done in good order,
<em class="italic">Cortez</em> determined as Captayne generall, to appoint
a Counsell, Aldermen, and Iudges.</p>

<p>And also ordeyne all other offices that shoulde be necessary
and néedefull to rule and gouerne a Citie, whych
he then pretended to edifie and erecte, the whiche Magistrates
should fully commaund, vntill such time that the
Emperour should otherwise prouide in matters conuenient
for his seruice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A good subiecte.</div>

<p>After this diligence put in vre, he solemnely tooke possession
of all y<sup>e</sup> land, in the name of the Emperour <em class="italic">Charles</em>
King of <em class="italic">Castill</em>, with all the actes and ceremonies, as to
such a matter apperteyned. And demaunded of <em class="italic">Francisco
Fernandez</em> notarie appoynted, that he shoulde gyue vnto
him by testimonie in writing, all the actes done therein.
All his company aunswered, that they did very well allowe
hys procéedings and praysed, and also approued
hys determination, besieching hym to procéede accordingly,
sithence they were come to serue and obey hym.
Then <em class="italic">Cortez</em> named Iudges, Aldermen, Attorney, Serieant,
Notary, and Towneclearke, and all other officers
apperteyning to the good gouernement of a Citie, in the
name and behalfe of the Emperoure hys naturall Lord,
and delyuered incontinent to the Iudges white roddes
to beare in their handes in token of Iustice, and named
the newe Citie to be builte, The ryche Towne
<em class="italic">De la vera Crux</em>, bycause that one goodfriday they had entred
into that land. After these things finished, <em class="italic">Cortez</em> began
before y<sup>e</sup> saide Notary, another act in presence of the
iudges, who were <em class="italic">Alounso Fernandez Portocarero</em>, and <em class="italic">Frācisco
de Monteio</em>, in whose handes he made cession, and dyd
desyst from all rule and offices whiche heretofore he had
receiued, which was his gouernership, captaineship and
general discouerer, receiued in the Chauncerie of <em class="italic">Santo
Domingo</em>, at the handes of the presidentes, who were
there chiefe of the kings counsell, and presidents, likewise
he protested not to vse the power and auctority of
the gouernour of <em class="italic">Cuba</em>, Admirall of <em class="italic">India</em>, for so much y<sup>t</sup>
now none of them had any rule or gouernement in that
Countrey which he and his fellowes had newely discouered,
and begun to enhabite in the name of the king of
Castil, as his naturall subiectes. The which auctoritie
he likewise required to be set downe in recorde, and to
haue a copie of the same.</p>

Al the newe officers toke possession and
charge of their offices, and entred into
the towne house to counsel according to
the vse and custome of Castill. In the
which congregation or counsel then holden,
many matters were had in question
as touching the good gouernemente of the common
weale. And among many other things, they al agréed to
electe <em class="italic">Hernando Cortez</em> for captaine generall and chiefe
Iustice, and to giue vnto him full power and authority
for all matters appertayning to the wars and conquest,
vntill such time as the Emperour should otherwise prouide:
with this determination the next day following al
the Aldermen, Iudges, and Counsellers, went vnto <em class="italic">Cortez</em>,
and sayde vnto him: Sir we haue greate neede of a
guide and captaine for the warres to procéede vppon the
conquest of this countrey, wherfore vntil such time as y<sup>e</sup>
Emperour shall prouide therein, they all besought hym
to accepte that office and charge, approuing him a man
most fit for the same, both to rule and gouerne, for y<sup>e</sup> great
experience that they had séene of his courage, wisdome,
and pollicie, and by Vertue of their offices, did cōmaund
him to accept the same, saying, that in so doing, God and
the king shoulde bee faithfully serued. And they woulde
thankfully gratify the same, knowing that at his hands
they should be ruled with iustice, vsed with humility, &#38;
be preserued with diligence and strength. And for that
purpose, they had chosen him for that office, giuing vnto
him their ful &#38; whole authority, submitting thēselues
vnder his hands, iurisdiction &#38; defence. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> accepted y<sup>e</sup>
charge at smal entreating, for he desired nothing so much.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Liberality.</div>

<p>And being in this sort elected general, the counsel said
vnto him. Sir you do wel vnderstād, that vntil such time
as we shal bee better planted in this countrey, we haue
not wherwith to maintaine our selues but only w<sup>t</sup> suche
things as are abord our shippes. Therfore it may please
you to commaund it to be brought ashore, and that you
take therof what shal seme good vnto you, for your houshold
and familie, and the residue may be taxed at a reasonable
price, and so to be deuided among them: &#38; for payment
they wold al binde thēselues, or else y<sup>t</sup> presently it
should be deducted out of the stocke, after that the kings
fift parte were subtracted. Likewise they desired him to
value his ships and artillery, bycause they would make
like payment for the same, and that frō thence forwards
the ships should serue in common, for to passe to the Ilāds
for bread, wine, clothes, weapons, horses, and other
things which should be néedeful for the new towne and
army, for therby they mought be better cheape prouided
than if merchants should prouide them, consideryng alway
they seke for excessiue gaine, saying that if it would
please hym to accepte thys offer and request, they would
thankfully requite the same. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> aunswered, that at y<sup>e</sup>
time he made his preperation and furniture in <em class="italic">Cuba</em>, he
ment not to sel his prouision as others vsed to do, but he
would and did frankely giue it vnto them, although hee
had spent his goods and indetted himselfe therin. And incontinent
he commaunded the maisters of the ships and
pursers, to bring a lād al their victual to the town house,
requiring the Aldermen to deuide it equally, to euerye
man his part, without making any difference of him or
of any other, for (quoth he) in time of neede of victuals y<sup>e</sup>
yongest hath as muche allowaunce as the eldest. And although
I am indetted and do owe more than seauen M.
Duckets, I giue this victuall al franckly vnto you. And
as cōcerning the ships, I wil do y<sup>t</sup> which shal be most cōueniēt
for you al. And (quoth he) I wil determin nothing
to be done with thē, but wil first giue you aduertisemēt
of the same.</p>

<p>Al this did <em class="italic">Cortez</em> for to get their loue and fauour, bycause
there were many that loued hym not, althoughe in
very trouth he was of his own nature liberal and large

For as much as the situation there
was not conuenient to place the
newe worke, they determined to
go from thence, to <em class="italic">Aguiahuiztlan</em>,
which standeth nere the shadowe
of the rocke that <em class="italic">Monteio</em> had informed
them of, wherevppon <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
commaunded the shippes to depart,
for that place. And he with his foure hundred men
and horses would goe by land, and there mete thē, which
may be about ten leagues iorney. In this order the fléete
departed, and likewise <em class="italic">Cortez</em> with his company toward
<em class="italic">Zempoallan</em> which stoode directly weastward. And after he
had iourneyed three leagues he came to the riuer which
deuided the Lordshippe of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> and <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em>, &#38;
coulde finde no passage, wherefore he was forced to returne
to the seaside, where with muche adoe they passed
ouer, and so trauayled on that side of the riuer, &#38; found
cotages of fishermen and other poore houses, and some
sowen ground, and procéeding on their iorney at length
they came into very faire valleys, wher was great store
of deare, and stil they went along the riuer side, hoping
to finde some good towne, and in short space, they espied
neare twenty persons vppon the toppe of a hill, <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
commaunded foure of his horsemen to fetch them vnto
him, willing thē to make signes of peace vnto them, but
if they flie (quoth he) then follow them, vntill you ouertake
them, for they shall stand vs in steade, as wel to lead
vs the way as to serue vs for enterpreters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Simplicitie.</div>

<p>The horsemen tooke on theyr way, and when they came
to the hill toppe, they made signes of peace vnto them, but
the poore and fearefull <em class="italic">Indians</em> fledde with spéede, yea being
amased and in great feare to beholde suche a monsterous
thyng as a horseman, beleuyng assuredly, that horse
and man was one thing incorporate, but in theyr flight
they were soone ouertaken, and they yéelded themselues,
and so were all brought vnto <em class="italic">Cortez</em>.</p>

<p>These men had in their eares and noses bored holes,
with rings of golde hangyng thereat, for so was the vse
of <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em>: they enformed <em class="italic">Cortez</em> that the Cittie was
neare at hande. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> demaunded the cause of their comyng
thither, they answered to behold and sée so straunge
a sight, but why fledde you then (quoth he?) for feare only
sir sayde they, of people which we knew not. Then <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
willed them to put all feare aside, and tolde them that he
with his small company woulde goe vnto their Cittie to
visite their Lorde, and to be acquaynted with him: the <em class="italic">Indians</em>
sayde, that the day was farre spent, and that it was
late to goe that night to <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em>, but if it pleased hym
they would conduct him to a village whiche stoode on the
otherside of the Riuer and within sight, and although it
were but a small village, yet there was reasonable lodging
with meate sufficiente for his armie: their counsell
séemed well, so they wente to that village, and when
they were comen thither, the <em class="italic">Indians</em> craued license to
goe &#38; to aduertise their Lorde how the straungers abode
in that place, promising to returne the nexte day with answere.
Some of the <em class="italic">Indians</em> had licence to do the message,
the others abode there, attendyng and prouiding for the
newe gestes, &#38; in this order they were al lodged and their
supper abundantly prouided. That night <em class="italic">Cortez</em> fortified
himselfe as strong as mought be, and the nexte morning
came a hundreth men laden with Hennes, saying that
their Lord much reioyced of their comming, and bicause
he was so grosse and vnwealdie, he came not personallye
vnto him, but yet notwithstanding he aboade in the cittie
expecting his comming. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> friendly welcomed them,
and with that presente, he and his company brake their
faste, and then proceeded with his guides in good order
with two fauconets in readinesse, if néede should happen:
and from that passage of the riuer they had a faire way
vntil they came to another riuer, which being likewise
waded ouer, they discried <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em>, whiche stoode a
myle distant from them, all beset wyth fayre Orchardes
and Gardens, verye pleasaunte to beholde: they vsed alwayes
to water them with sluses when they pleased.</p>

<p>There procéeded out of the Towne many persons, to
behold and receyue so strange a people vnto them. They
came with smiling countenance, and presented vnto thē
diuers kinde of Floures, and sundry fruites, which none
of our menne had héeretofore séene. These people came
without feare among the Ordinance, with this pompe,
triumph and ioy they were receiued into the Citie, which
séemed a beautifull Garden: for the trées were so gréene
and high, that scarsely the houses appeared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mens folly vvith a great lyr.</div>

<p>At the Citie gate stoode many graue persons of nobilitie,
as Magistrates of the Citie, who solemnely welcomed
the Strangers. Sixe Horsemen, which hadde gone
before the army to discouer, returned backe as <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
was entring into the Citie, saying, that they had séene a
great house and Court, and that the walles were garnished
with siluer. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> commaunded them to procéede
on, willing them not to shew any token of wonder of any
thing that they should sée. All the stréetes were replenished
with people, whiche stoode gaping and wondering
at the horses and straūgers. And passing through a great
market place, they saw on their right hande, a great walled
house made of lyme and stone, with loupe holes and
towers, whited with playster that shined lyke siluer, being
so well burnished and the sunne glistering vpon it. And
that was the thing that the Spaniards thought had bene
walles of siluer. I doe beléeue that with the imagination
and great desire whiche they had of golde and siluer, all
that shined they déemed to be the same mettall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A vigilant Captayne.</div>

<p>Within this great house was a long rew of lodgings,
and on the other side sixe or seuen Towers one higher
than another. They procéeded on, dissimulyng the errour
of the siluer walles, and followed their guide vntill suche
time as they came to the Lordes lodging, who came forth
accompanied with many auncient persons, and better attired
than the other Citizens were, with twoo Gentlemen
that ledde him by the armes. They saluted eche other according
to the vse of their countreys, and then entred into
the pallayce, where certayne principall men conducted
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> and all his trayne to their lodgyng, and Captayne
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> was lodged in the house whiche had the glisteryng
walles, situated in the markette place, whiche house was
sufficient for him and all his company. And when they
were placed, and behelde the walles, they were ashamed
of their owne folly: for where they thought those walles
had bene adorned with siluer, they founde them cleane
contrary. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> deuided his men, caused his horses to be
trimmed, and planted his ordinaunce at his dore, making
himselfe as strong as though he had bene in campe and
néere his enimies. And commaunded, that none of his
men shoulde goe out of the house without his expresse licence
vpō payne of death. The officers of the Lorde prepared
a plenteous supper for them, and beddyng according
to their vse.</p>

The nexte day in the mornyng came the
Lorde, to visite <em class="italic">Cortez</em> with an honorable
company, and presented vnto him many
garmēts wrought of Cottē wolle, according
to their fashion, with a knot on the
shoulder like vnto the Egiptian garments,
and certaine iewels of golde that might be worth
two thousande Ducates, besechyng both him and his cōpany
to recreate themselues and take their reste, and at
that present he meante not to trouble him with any matters:
And so tooke his leaue for that time as he had done
the day before, willing him to demaunde and call for any
thing that he should néede. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> gaue him hartie thāks,
and so departed.</p>

<p>Then came moe <em class="italic">Indians</em> in number than there were
Spaniardes, with their courses &#38; seruice of meate ready
dressed, and many boughes of daintie fruits. In this sorte
they were feasted &#38; bāketed fiftene daies most plētuously.
The next day folowyng, <em class="italic">Cortez</em> sent vnto the Spaniardes
certaine olde garments of the Spanishe fashion, and many
other trifles, besechyng him to appoynt a day of conference
at his owne pallayce: worde was sent agayne that
he was ready and very well contented. Wherevpon <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
tooke with him fiftie of his men all armed, and left the
residue at his lodgyng in a good readinesse, and appoynted
an vnder Captayne to gouerne them. The Lorde
hearing of his comming, came out of his Courte into the
streate to receyue him. And hande in hand they entred togither
into a lowe hall, whiche they vse for the extremitie
of heate in that countrey, the plotte that they buylde vpon
is raysed a fadome from the grounde, so that they ascende
vpon steppes, and the walles plaistered with very white
lime, their tile is eyther of straw or leaues of trées, very
beautifull and straungely wrought, and a good defence against
the rayne. The Lorde and <em class="italic">Cortes</em> satte them downe
vpon thrée footed stooles made all of one péece, the Lorde
commaunded his seruitours to stand aside, and by their
interpreters they began to commune of their affayres a
great space, in demaundes and answeres, bicause <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
desired to be well instructed of the affayres of that countrey,
and lykewise of that mightie kyng of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>.</p>

<p>This <em class="italic">Cacike</em> or Lord although he were huge and laden
with fleshe, yet in his demaundes and questions séemed
very wise. The summe of all <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his talke was to
shewe the cause of his comming thither, and who had
sente him, euen as he had done in <em class="italic">Tauasco</em> to <em class="italic">Teudilli</em> and

<p>This <em class="italic">Cacike</em> after he had heard <em class="italic">Cortes</em> attentiuely, he began

<p>Mightie Sir, my Antecessors liued a long tyme in
great peace, libertie and quietnesse, but of late yéeres
my countrey and Cittie was destroyed by tiranny, bycause
the Lordes of <em class="italic">Mexico Tenuchtitlan</em> with their men
of <em class="italic">Culhua</em> did not only vsurpe my Citie, but also my lands
by force of armes, in suche sorte that my power coulde
not resiste them. And in the beginnyng those Princes
beganne theyr vsurpation by way and colour of religion
and holinesse, and afterwardes with force of armes, and
with this title became Lordes ouer vs.</p>

<p>And nowe we seyng our errour, haue thought it to
late to preuayle agaynst them to take away our yoke of
seruitude and bondage, although we haue attempted it.
And as often as we haue so done, still the victorie was
theyrs, and the ouerthrowe ours. Nowe all suche as doe
submitte themselues vnto them, are taxed with certayne

not suffer to bée Vassall willingly to so good a Prince
as you enformed me of the Emperour, although it were
but onely to bée frée from suche vexation and robbery
whiche suche a mighty King coulde doe. And with these
wordes the teares gusshed out of his eyes, and pawsing
a whyle, he beganne to extoll the strength, magnificence
and situation of <em class="italic">Mexico</em> planted in a greate lake
of water: also he exalted the riches, courte, Maiestie and
mightie power of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>. Hée sayde also howe
<em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, <em class="italic">Huexocinco</em> and other prouinces thereaboute,
as also the people called <em class="italic">Totonaquez</em> of the Mountaynes
were of contrary opinion to the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>, yea enimies
vnto them, who had intelligence what had happened in
<em class="italic">Tauasco</em>, Yea sir (quoth hée) if it please you, I will treate
suche a compact with this people that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> with al
his power shall not preuayle agaynst vs.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> reioyced in harte to heare this newes, and
sayde vnto him. It grieueth mée to heare of the euill
vsage of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> towarde his countrey and subiectes.
But I assure you with Gods helpe I will deliuer you,
yea and reuenge all your iniuries, for my commyng hither
is to take away all euill customes, and to helpe the
oppressed, to fauour the prysoner, and comforte the afflicted,
and chiefly to abolishe tyrannie. And for the
good entertaynement that I haue receyued at your
handes, I doe remayne yours to doe you any pleasure,
and to defende you agaynst your enimies, and the lyke
will I doe for your friendes, wherefore I pray you aduertise
them thereof as many as are of our confederacie.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> then tooke hys leaue, saying that he had bene
many dayes there, and that he had greate néede to goe
visite his shippes and menne, who muche desired his returne,
and abode in <em class="italic">Aquiahuiztlan</em>, where hée meante
to soiourne for a certayne season, and from thence dayly
they mighte conferre of their affayres. The Lorde
of <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em> sayde, that if it pleased hym to abyde with
him hée woulde gladly accept it, and if his businesse were
suche that he might not, that then he besought him to remember
him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An other gifte.</div>

<p>Then the Lorde commaunded eyght maydens to be
called, who were very well apparelled after theyr maner,
theyr attyre was muche lyke the <em class="italic">Morisca</em> fashion, (the
one of them was more costely apparelled than the others)
and sayde vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, all these maydens whiche
you here sée are Gentlewomen, noble and riche, and
this mayden whiche is beste attired, is a Lady of Vassals,
and my brothers daughter, I doe presente hyr vnto
you (meaning that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> shoulde marrie with hyr,) and
the others you may bestow vpon the Gentlemen in your

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> receyued the presente with thankes, bycause he
woulde not offende the giuer thereof. And so departed
with their women ridyng behinde them, with many <em class="italic">Indian</em>

The same day that they departed frō <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em>
they came to <em class="italic">Chiauiztlan</em>, and yet
the shippes were not arriued. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> marueyled
at their long tarying in so shorte a
iourney. Ther was a village within shotte
of a hargabushe from the rocke called
<em class="italic">Chiauiztlan</em> standyng vpon a litle hill. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> hauing little
to do, went thither with his men, and the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em>,
who certified <em class="italic">Cortes</em> that the village was appertayning
to a Lorde oppressed by <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>. They came
to the foote of the hill, without sighte of any man of the
towne, excepte twoo, that <em class="italic">Marina</em> vnderstoode not, and going
vp the hill, the horsemen to fauour their horses would
alight, bicause the ascending was cragged and euill way,
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> commaunded that they shoulde not alight, bycause
the <em class="italic">Indians</em> shoulde thinke that there was no place highe
nor lowe, but that these horses shoulde and coulde come
vnto it. So by litle and litle they came into the towne,
and finding no creature there, they feared some deceyte,
yet approchyng further, they mette with twelue auncient
men, whiche brought with them an interpreter who vnderstoode
the language of <em class="italic">Culhua</em> and the speache of
that place, whiche is the language of the <em class="italic">Totonaquez</em>,
or inhabitauntes of the Mountaynes. These auncient
menne declared that the cause of theyr goyng out of
the towne, was bycause that they had neuer séene anye
such men as the Spaniardes were, nor yet heard that any
such had passed that way, wherefore with feare they
had fledde from thence. But (quoth they) when the Lord
of <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em> aduertised vs, how you did hurt no bodye,
but rather being a people good and peaceable, then wee
were well assured who ye were, when we saw you come
toward vs. And wee are nowe comen vnto you on the
behalfe of the Lorde, to bring you to your lodging.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> gaue them thankes, and went with them to a
certaine place where the Lord was abydyng their comming
wel accompanyed: he shewed vnto the Christians
great good wil, and maruelled to sée those straungers
with their long beardes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A straunge salutation.</div>

<p>The Lord toke a little chafyngdishe in his hande, and
cast into it a certaine gumme, whych sauoured in swéet
smel much like vnto frankinscence. And with a sencer he
smoked <em class="italic">Cortez</em> with this ceremony they vse their salutations
to theyr gods and nobilitie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A straunge hap.</div>

<p>This done they set them down, and <em class="italic">Cortez</em> enformed
him of the cause of their comming into that countrey as
he had done in all other places where he had bin.</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">Casike</em> certifyed <em class="italic">Cortez</em> euen as the Lord of <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em>
had done, but he stood in great feare least <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
should be offended for receyuing and lodging him within
that towne, without his commaundement, and being
in thys communication, sodenly appeared twentye men
entring where they sate, w<sup>t</sup> certain wāds like cudgels in
their hāds, which did signify y<sup>t</sup> they were rent gatherers
&#38; in ech other hand, a fly flap of feathers, the <em class="italic">Cacike</em> &#38; hys
company were soare afrayde. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> demaunded wherefore
he so altered himself, he answered, bicause those twēty
<em class="italic">Indians</em> were collecters of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, and that he feared
that they would complayne of him, hauing founde those
Christians there, he feared likewise cruell punishment
for the same. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> comforted him, saying that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
was his friende, and that he would so vse the matter that
he shoulde receyue no blame at all, but rather that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
shoulde giue him thankes for that whiche he had
done: And if <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> did not, or would not so accept it,
that then he would defend both him and his subiects, for
(quoth he) euery one of my mē is sufficient for a thousand
<em class="italic">Mexicans</em>, as <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> himselfe was well enformed by
the late warres at <em class="italic">Potonchan</em>.</p>

<p>Yet for and notwithstanding all this talke, the Lorde
and all his folke were in great feare, and meante to arise
and to lodge the receyuers. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> woulde not suffer him,
and bycause (quoth he) thou shalte sée what I and my men
can doe, commaund thy seruaunts to apprehend and take
prysoners these receyuers of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and I wil abide here
with thée, in such sorte that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> with all his power
shall not offende thée.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The receyuers put in pryson.</div>

<p>With the courage that he receyued at these wordes,
he commaunded to lay hande vpon the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>, and bycause
they defended themselues, they were sore beaten,
and layde euery one in a seuerall prison, and bounde them
to a great poste whereat they were tied by the throate,
féete, and handes, and beyng in this sorte imprysoned, they
asked of <em class="italic">Cortes</em> whether they should kill them. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> requested
that they should not be slaine, but that they might
remayne as they were, with good watch that they might
not escape: Then they were brought into a hall in the
Spaniardes lodging, and were placed rounde aboute a
good fire, but yet bounde hande and foote with garde of
watchmen. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> also appoynted certaine of his men to
watch the hall dore, and then went to his lodging to supper,
where he and his company was well prouided at the
<em class="italic">Caziks</em> furniture.</p>

The nighte beyng farre spent, and the <em class="italic">Indians</em>
that kepte the watch being asléepe,
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> sente vnto the Spanyardes that
watched at the hall dore where the prysoners
were, and commaunded them to
let goe twoo of the prysoners, as secretly
as they might, and to bring them vnto him. The Spaniardes
handled the matter so well, that they fulfilled his
desire, and brought twoo of them to <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his chamber,
who looked vppon them as though he had not knowen
them, and willed <em class="italic">Aguillar</em> and <em class="italic">Maryna</em> to demaunde who
they were, and what they would haue, and why they had
bene in pryson. They answered, that they were vassals of
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, and that they had the charge to receyue certayne
tributes, that those of that towne &#38; prouince payde
vnto their Lorde. And also (quoth they) we know not for
what cause we are nowe imprysoned and so euelly vsed.
We rather wōder to sée this new custome and madnesse,
for in time past these men were wont to méete vs and receiue
vs with great honour &#38; curtesie, shewing all seruice
and pleasure. Therefore we thinke that the cause of this
alteration is through the fauour of you and your cōpany,
who beare the name of immortalitie. We also feare least
our felowes which are in prison shal be slaine, before <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
haue knowlege therof. Also said they, these barbarous
people dwelling in the Mountaynes, would be glad
to rebel if they foūd any succour or ayde, only to put their
Prince to cost and charges, as heretofore they haue done.
Therefore they moste humbly besought <em class="italic">Cortes</em> that hée
shoulde not permitte them and their fellowes to be slaine,
nor yet to abide in the handes of their enimies wherein
he should do singular pleasure to <em class="italic">Mutesuma</em> their lord, &#38;
otherwise if they should perish, their Lord would be very
sorowfull that his olde, faithful and trustie seruaunts
shoulde haue such a reward for their good seruice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A vvise Captaine.</div>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> aunswered that it grieued him much, that <em class="italic">Mutesuma</em>
his friend should be misvsed wher he was, no nor
yet his seruauntes euill entreated, and that hee woulde
haue as muche care ouer them as of his owne, willing
them to prayse the god of heauen, and to be thankful vnto
him that had commaunded them to be set at liberty,
in the grace and friendshippe of <em class="italic">Mutesuma</em>: he certifyed
that in all haste they shoulde be dispatched, for <em class="italic">Mexico</em>
with certaine busynesse therefore (quoth he) get you to
meate, and make you strōg to take in hand that iourney,
trusting to your féete least ye should be taken againe to
your greate perill and daunger, Iwis their meate was
soone eaten with the great hast they had to be gone.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> brought them out of the towne and gaue them
victuall to carry with them. And charged for the liberty
and curtesie shewed vnto them, that they should signifye
to <em class="italic">Mutesuma</em> their Lorde, howe that he was his assured
friend, and that after he had vnderstanding of his fame,
goodnes and mighty power, he much desired to serue him
yea and that he helde himselfe happy, to fynde himselfe
at such a time &#38; season to loose those his seruaunts, and to
shew therin his good wil, likewyse he woulde do all that
lay in him to preserue the honour and auctority of so gret
a Prince as hee was, &#38; also to defende his subiectes and
to loke to his affaires as his owne proper, although his
highnesse dyd little estéeme hys friendshippe as appeared
by <em class="italic">Teudilli</em>, who departed from him without bidding
him farewell, and likewise absenting all the people of
the sea coaste: yet thys notwithstanding he would not
let to do him seruice at all times when occasion shoulde
serue, and to procure by all meanes possible his grace, fauour,
and friendship, and that he was fully perswaded,
that his hyghnesse woulde not refuse his good will and
friendship, considering that with his acquaintance, God
had done much for him, to méete with a seruaunte of the
Emperoures, for thereby he might know great secretes
of holy things, and also receyue greate benefytes, if then
he would refuse the same, the fault shoulde be his: but yet
notwithstanding he trusted in his wisedome, that considering
the thing well, he woulde be glad both to sée hym,
and talke with him, and also to be friende and brother
with the King of <em class="italic">Spayne</em>, in whose most happie name,
both he and his company were come thither. And as
touching his seruauntes that remayned in prison, hée
woulde so vse the matter, that they should escape all perill,
promising also to set them at libertie to pleasure him,
and that incontinente he woulde haue done it, but onely
bycause he woulde not offende the Lorde of the Towne,
who had friendly entertayned him with greate curtesie,
for which cause he would not presume to controll him in
his owne house, nor yet to shewe himselfe vnthankefull.
The messengers departed with this message very glad
and ioyfull, promising to accomplishe faithfully y<sup>e</sup> charge
committed vnto them.</p>

When the <em class="italic">Cazike</em> founde missing the two
prisoners, he blamed muche the guarde or
watch, and pretended forthwith to murther
those that remayned. Then came
<em class="italic">Cortez</em>, and requested that their deathe
shoulde be pardoned, for so muche as they
were but officers obediente to their Lorde and maister,
and according to iustice they had committed no offence,
nor yet deserued anye correction in the facte, whiche was
seruice to their King: but for so muche as they shall not
flée as the other two haue done, deliuer them vnto mee,
and I will take them to my custody and charge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diuers opinions in counsell.</div>

<p>Vpon this request the eyghtéene prisoners were delyuered
vnto <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, who sent them aboorde his Shyppes,
and there commaunded them to be put in yrons. The
Lorde and his counsellors fearing what mighte followe,
entred into councell what was best to doe, consideryng
that they certaynely beléeued that the two prisoners
whiche were escaped, would certifie in <em class="italic">Mexico</em> the shame
and cruell entertaynemente done vnto them. Some replyed
that it was iust and requisite to sende vnto <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
hys tribute, with other presentes, to mitigate hys
anger, and to excuse them, and accuse the Christians, who
were the causes of the apprehension of his officers, and
to craue pardon of their erroure and ouersighte whyche
they hadde committed as madde men, in dishonor of the
maiestie of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>. Others aunswered agayne, that it
were muche better to cast off that yoke of bondage and
slauery, and to giue no longer obedience to the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>,
who were both cruell and wicked tyrants, and also considering
that now they had on their side those halfe Gods,
and inuincible horsemen, saying likewise that they should
not wante many others their neyghbours and borderers
to help and succour them.</p>

<p>In this sorte they resolued themselues fully to rebell,
and not to lose so good an occasion, wherevppon they besoughte
<em class="italic">Hernando Cortes</em> to bée their defendor and Captayne,
considering that for his sake they had begun that
enterprise, and whether <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> shoulde prepare hys
army againste them or no, yet they on their parte were
fully pretended to hold hym warre, and to desist from seruitude.</p>

<p>God knoweth how glad <em class="italic">Cortes</em> was to heare this matter,
for he well wayed that it was the high way to hys
iourneys ende: yet dissimuling the cause, he aunswered
that they should well looke to the thing which they meant
to take in hande, bycause (quoth he) I vnderstande that
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> is a mightie Prince, but if ye will valiantly
procéede, I will be youre Captayne, and safely defende
you, for I do more estéeme your friendship, than the good
will of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, whyche I nothing care for: therefore
lette me knowe what number of men of warre yée
are able to make. Sir (quoth they) among all our friends
wée are able to make a hundred thousande menne
of warre. I lyke that well quoth <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, wherefore incontinente
sende youre postes, with aduise vnto all your
friendes in league againste <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, and certifie them
of this agréemente and succoure of the Christians, not
(quoth he) that I stande in néede of your help, for I alone
with my company are able to stande againste those of
<em class="italic">Culhua</em>, although they were as manye more, but reason
required that they shoulde be warned of your pretence,
and to be in readinesse for the same, fearing least <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
mighte sende his army vpon a suddayne, and finde you
vnprouided.</p>

<p>With this aduise and encouragement of <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, &#38; also
they themselues being a people heady and of small consideratiō,
they dispatched incōtinent their messēgers to all
the Townes and Villages of neyghbours and friendes,
aduertising them what they hadde determined, exalting
the strangers aboue the cloudes.</p>

<p>And by this meanes rebelled many <em class="italic">Cazikes</em> &#38; townes,
and all the whole Mountaynes, so y<sup>t</sup> there was not left any
collector or other officer of <em class="italic">Mexico</em> in al those borders,
with open proclamation of warres againste <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
and all his adherentes.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> his intēt was on the other side, to stirre vp these
Indians, to get both their goodes, willes, and landes, for
otherwise, he could not well bring his matter to passe: he
only caused the officers of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, to be taken prisoners,
and to be loused agayne, he fayned a greate loue to
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, and stirred his subiectes agaynste him, he offered
to be their defendor, and lefte them rebelled, to the
intent that they should stand in néede of him.</p>

At this instant the Fléete was arriued at

and carried with him many <em class="italic">Indians</em> of the
Rebels, both of that Towne, and also of
<em class="italic">Zempoallan</em>, who did good seruice to cutte
downe timber, and to carrie stones to the place appoynted,
for the building of the Citie, named the riche towne
of <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em>, accordyng to the determination, when the
officers were appoynted for the same, and chosen in S.
<em class="italic">Iohn de Vlhua</em>, and in good order made repertition to the
inhabitants of the ground, and plottes to builde vpon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Embassadors.</div>

<p>They appoynted also a place for the high Churche, a
Market place, a Towne house, a Gayle, store houses, a
kay or Wharfe, to lade or vnlade, a butcher row, &#38; other
places necessary to the good gouernement and pollicie of

or Fort on, néere the roade in a place conueniente, and in
this sort began theyr worke, and their houses made with
mudwall, for the earth there is good for that purpose.
And euery man being this occupyed in this new worke,
came from <em class="italic">Mexico</em> two kinsmen of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, with
other four graue learned menne for Councellors, and
many seruing men that attended vppon them, as Ambassadors
from <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, they presented vnto <em class="italic">Cortez</em> certayne
cloth of Cotten well wouen, and feathers curiously
and fynely wroughte, other péeces of golde and siluer
wrought, and a Casket of graynes of golde, as they
were founde in the Mynes not molten, which wayed altogyther
two thousand &#38; ninetie Castlins, &#38; sayd, y<sup>t</sup> <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
hadde sente hym the golde in the Casket, to cure
theyr disease, and woulde gladly knowe howe they fared,
giuing also vnto him most hartie thankes, for loosing
his two housholde seruauntes, and preseruing the others
from slaughter, besiechying hym to make accompte, that
hée woulde doe the lyke in anye affayres of his, desiring
hym also to procure the libertie of the other eyghtéene
Prisoners: and bycause those <em class="italic">Indians</em> hadde entertayned
hym well in their houses, he did pardon their vprore,
yet notwithstanding he knewe very well that they were
suche a kynde of people, that in shorte space they woulde
committe some other offences, whereby they myght bée
chastned for all togyther, euen as a Dogge deserueth

theyr Lorde was not well at ease, and also occupyed in
matters of warre of greate importance, whereby at
that presente, there was no remedie to visit eache other,
but in processe of tyme his desire shoulde be accomplished.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> welcommed them friendly and ioyfully, and also
lodged them in Cotages néere vnto the water side, and
sent forthwith for the Lorde of <em class="italic">Chiautztlan</em>, that had rebelled,
who came at his commandement. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> sayd vnto
him, lo sée what troth I haue vsed with thée, for <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>

without rendryng the tributes accustomed. He requested
to set at libertie the prisoners, and to restore thē

the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em> sente vnto
<em class="italic">Cortes</em>, to desire him of succour against the
garrisō of <em class="italic">Culhua</em>, which <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> mainteyned
in <em class="italic">Tizapansinca</em>, who did greately anoy
them, in spoyling, burning, and destroying theyr
corne in the fieldes, and slew their husbandmen, and toke
many prisoners. The Towne of <em class="italic">Tizapansinca</em> doth confine
with the <em class="italic">Totonaquez</em>, and with the grounde of <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em>,
and is a good strong Towne, scituated néere the Riuer,
and hath a fort standing vpon a high rocke. And bycause
this Towne was strong, and planted among them who
were alwayes seditious and Rebelles, <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> placed
there his garrison, who séeyng the officers of receyuers
and auditors come flying thyther for helpe, béeyng persecuted
of the Rebels, they wente out to pacifie the Rebellion,
and for to chasten them, they burned and destroyed
whatsoeuer they found, and also had taken many prisoners.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> hearing this newes, departed towarde <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em>,
and from thence in two dayes iourney with a greate
armye of <em class="italic">Indians</em> to <em class="italic">Tizapansinca</em>, which stoode eyghte
leagues and more from that Citie.</p>

<p>The garrison of <em class="italic">Culhua</em> came into the fielde, thinkyng
to haue hadde battayle onely with those of <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em>,
but when they saw the Horsemen and the bearded men,
they lost theyr courage, and beganne to flye as fast as
they myghte possible: theyr succoure béeyng néere, they
were soone in holde: they woulde haue entred into theyr
Castell, but for y<sup>e</sup> swiftnesse of the Horses which stopped
theyr way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The valiant courage of Cortez.</div>

<p>And when the Horses coulde not ascende vp vnto the
forte, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> alighted with other foure of hys men, and among
the preasse of the Townesmen gote into the forte,
and béeyng within, they kept the dore tyll theyr companye
came wyth manye friendes, vnto whome hée delyuered
the forte and Towne, desiring to do no hurte to the
inhabitantes, but to suffer them to depart fréely without
weapon and standerde. It was a newe worlde to those
<em class="italic">Indians</em>, who did fulfyll <em class="italic">Cortes</em> hys commaundemente
in all poyntes. Thys done, <em class="italic">Cortez</em> returned agayne
to the Sea coast, by the same way whiche hée hadde
come.</p>

<p>This was the firste victory that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> had among the
subiectes of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, whereby all the Mountaynes
remayned frée from the vexations of the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>, and
all our men with great fame and reputation, as well among
their friendes, as among their enimies, in so much
that afterwardes when any neede did happen among the
<em class="italic">Indians</em>, they would immediately sende vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em> for one
of his men, saying, that one man alone of the Chrystians,
was sufficient to be their Captayne and securitie.</p>

<p>Thys was a good begynnyng for the pretence of
<em class="italic">Cortes</em>. Now when he came to <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em> wyth hys company
triumphantly, he founde there <em class="italic">Francisco de Salzeda</em>,
who was come with his caruell which he had boughte
of <em class="italic">Alonso Cauallero</em>, a dweller in <em class="italic">Saint Iames de Cuba</em>, and
was left there to be grounded and dressed at his departure
from thence. He brought with him .70. Spanyardes,
and nine Horses and Mares, wherewith they all maruellously
reioyced.</p>

<em class="italic">Cortez</em> made greate hast in
building vp the new town
and the Castell, bycause
the Citizens and souldiers
mighte haue succoure againste
winde and rayne,
and commoditie of householde,
and lykewise to bée
assured of defence against
enimies if néede shoulde
happen, pretending lykewise
with all expedition, to enter within the land toward
<em class="italic">Mexico</em>, to visit <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, and to leaue in that newe
worke all thing in good order, he finished many thinges,
touching as well the peace as the warre.</p>

<p>He commaunded to be brought a lande out of his
shippes all the armour &#38; other furniture for the warres,
with the Merchandise, victuall and other prouision, and
to deliuer it to the rulers of the newe Cittie, accordyng to
his promisse. He also signified vnto all his company that
it was méete and conuenient, to sende relation to the
Kyng of all theyr proceedings and dealings in that countrey,
with demonstration of Golde and Siluer there
founde.</p>

<p>And (quoth he) to deale vprightly in this case, it is
necessary to deuide equally our treasure to euery man his
portion, accordyng to the vse of the warres, the deuision
beyng made, then firste and principally lette vs deduct the
Kings fifte parte. And for the better performance therof,
I doe name and appoynt <em class="italic">Alounso de Auila</em> Treasurer for
the King, and also I doe elect <em class="italic">Gonsalo Mexia</em> Treasurer of
the armie.</p>

<p>All the newe Magistrates ratified his sayings, and allowed
his discretion and wisedome, praysing the election
of the newe officers as men moste méete for suche an office,
and besought them to accept theyr charge.</p>

<p>This diligence done, he commaunded to bring foorth
into the markette place all the goodes and treasure which
they had gotten, as well cloth of Cotten, Feathers,
Golde, and Plate, whiche mought amount vnto in valew
the summe of .27000. Ducates: The same he caused
to be delyuered vnto the newe elected treasorers by account,
requestyng the whole counsell of the Cittie that
they shoulde make deuision thereof. The counsellours
and communaltie replyed, saying: Sir here is nothing to
deuide, for deductyng the fifte parte whiche appertayneth
to the King, all the reste shall be to make payment for the
furniture whiche you prepared for this voyage, and you
beyng satisfied, then the shippes, munition and furniture
shall serue in common for vs all, beséeching him with one
assent to take all the treasure, and to sende vnto the kings
maiestie his portion or fifte parte, euen as shoulde séeme
most conuenient vnto him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Liberalitie of Cortez.</div>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> replied and sayde, that time hereafter shoulde

shal be for the Gentlemen of my company, wherewith
yée may beginne to make payment of your debtes,
whiche ye ought when ye made your prouision to come

<p>And where I haue appoynted certayne things to send

please them, for as muche as they were suche things as
coulde not be well deuided, and likewyse the firste fruite

those collers were beautifull to beholde, and had many
other fine thyngs wrought in them, than is here declared.</li>

<li>Many graynes of golde of the bignesse of a pease, euen as
they were founde.</li>

<li>A Casket of graynes of golde of the same sorte.</li>

<li>A Helmet of woodde champed with golde and besette

<li>A bracelet of golde of small weight.</li>

<li>A rodde lyke vnto a roiall Scepter, with twoo rings of

<li>Foure forkes with thrée shepehookes at ech, couered with

<li>Many payres of shoes made of Déere skinnes, sowed
with golde thréede, and in the soales were sette certayne

<li>Sixe payre of letherne shoes of diuers colours, garnished

<li>A Targatte of woodde couered with leather, beset round

the same <em class="italic">Vitsilopucthli</em>, God of the warres, and also
foure heads set crossewise, whiche heades were of a

<li>Manye shirtes, Iackettes, headclothes and other naperie.</li>

<li>Many Carpets and hangings of cotten.</li>
</ul>

<p>Al these things wer more beautiful than rich, although
the whéeles were very rich, the workmanshippe of al the
rest, was more worth than the thing it selfe. The colours
of the cloth of cotten wool was excéeding fine, and the fethers
natural.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Straunge Paper.</div>

<p>The pounced worke in gold and siluer did excéed our
goldsmithes, of whiche things we wil write in an other
place. They ioyned with this present certaine <em class="italic">Indian</em>
bookes of figures which serue to their vse for letters: these
bookes are folden like vnto clothes, and written on both
sides. Some of these bookes were made of cotten &#38; glewe,
and others were made of leaues of a certaine trée called
Melt, whyche serue for theyr paper, a thyng straunge to

<p>At that time the <em class="italic">Indiās</em> of <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em> had many prisoners
to sacrifice. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> demaunded them to send vnto the
Emperour, but the <em class="italic">Indians</em> desired him to pardon them,
for if we so do (quoth they) we shall offend our gods, who
will take awaye our corne and children from vs, yea and
also our liues in so doing.</p>

<p>Yet notwithstanding, <em class="italic">Cortez</em> tooke foure of them, and
two women which were al yong and lustie.</p>

<p>But it was very strange to sée those that shold be sacrificed,
how they wer trimmed and deckt with feathers,
and went dauncing through the Cittie, asking almes for
their sacrifice &#38; death. It was also strange to sée the offerings
y<sup>t</sup> were giuen thē. They had at their eares hanging
rings of gold beset with turkie stones, &#38; likewise other
rings at their lippes, whiche shewed their téeth bare, a
griesely sight to sée, but yet estéemed among them a thing
beautifull.</p>

Letters from the army and magistrates of

When this present and fift part was layde
aside for the king, <em class="italic">Cortez</em> required the magistrats
to name and appoint two atturnyes,
to carry the Emperors portion vnto
Spayne. And that he for his part wold
giue vnto them his full power, and letter of attourneye,
with also one of his beste Shippes for that voyage.</p>

<p>The Counsell of the newe towne chose <em class="italic">Alounso
Fernandez Portocarero</em>, and <em class="italic">Francisco de Monteio</em> for that
iourneye: whereof <em class="italic">Cortez</em> was verye glad, and gaue
them <em class="italic">Antonio de Alominos</em> for their pilot, with golde
and plate sufficiente for tourne and retourne of the
voyage. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> gaue them instructions, what they
shoulde doe particularlye for hym, in the Courte of
Spaine as also in Ciuil, and the towne where he was
borne. Hee sente to his Father and Mother certaine
money, with newes of his prosperitye: hee sente
also with them the ordinaunces and actes instituted,
and wrote by them a large letter to the Emperour,
in the whiche hee gaue full aduertisemente of all
things whyche hadde passed from the time of his departure
from the Ilande of <em class="italic">Cuba</em> vntil that day, and of
the discord betwéene hym and <em class="italic">Iames Valasques</em>, and of
their greate traueyle and paynes, with the greate
good will whiche they all bare vnto hys royall seruice:
hee certified likewise of the riches of that countreye,
with the maiestie and power of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>.
Hee offered to bring in subiection vnto his royall
Crown and state of Castil, al that Empire, &#38; to winne
also the greate Citie of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and to bring that
mightie king <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> to his handes quicke or deade.</p>

<p>Beséeching the Emperours maiestie to haue hym in
remembraunce when offices and prouisions shoulde bee
sente vnto that newe Spayne latelye discouered at
hys great costes, and in recompence of hys paines and
trauell.</p>

<p>The Counsell and magistrates of <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em> wrote
also two letters to the Emperour, the one was touching
the successe of their procéedings in his royall seruice.
In that letter, went onely the Aldermens firmes,
and Iudges.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A good protestatiō.</div>

<p>The other letter was firmed by the generalitye and
chiefest of the army, the contentes whereof was in substance,
that they would holde and kepe that towne and
countrey wonne, in his royall name, or ende theyr lyues
in the quarrel, if his maiestie did not otherwise determyne.</p>

<p>They also moste humblye besought him, that the gouernement
thereof, and of al that hereafter shoulde bee
conquered, might be giuen to <em class="italic">Hernādo Cortez</em> their guide,
generall captaine, and chiefe Iustice by them electe
and chosen, saying, that wel he had deserued the same, for
that he alone spent more than the whole army vpon that
iourney. And that it might please his maiesty to confirm
that, which they generally of fréewill had done for theyr
owne safegard and securitye, in the name of his royall
maiestie.</p>

<p>And if by chaunce his maiestie had already giuen the
sayde office of gouernement to any other person, that it
might please him to reuoke it.</p>

<p>For so should it be expedient for his seruice, and quietnesse
of the countrey. And thereby might be excused, rumours,
slanders, perils, and slaughters, that myght ensue,
if any other should gouerne and rule as captaine
general.</p>

<p>And moreouer they besoughte hys maiestie to
graunte them aunswere with breuity, and good dispatch
of theyr attourneys, who departed from the porte of
<em class="italic">Aguiahuistlan</em> in a reasonable shippe the twenty sixe day
of July, <em class="italic">Anno</em> .1519.</p>

<p>They touched by the way at <em class="italic">Marien</em> a port of <em class="italic">Cuba</em>, declaring
that they went to <em class="italic">Hauana</em>: they passed through
the chanell of <em class="italic">Bahama</em> without disturbaunce, and sayled
with a prosperous winde, till they arriued in Spayne.</p>

<p>The cause why the generaltye had written these letters
was, suspecting <em class="italic">Iames Velasques</em>, who had frends and
great fauour in the Court and counsel of <em class="italic">Indias</em>, and also
some secrete friendes in <em class="italic">Cortez</em> his campe. For <em class="italic">Francisco
Salzeda</em> brought newes that <em class="italic">Iames Velasques</em> had already
obteyned a graunt of the Emperor for the gouernment
of that land by the meanes of one <em class="italic">Benito Martinez</em> going
into Spayne. And although they knew not the certainty
thereof, yet it was most true, as shal appeare in another

There wer some in the host y<sup>t</sup> murmured
against the election of <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, for thereby
was excluded <em class="italic">Iames Valasques</em>, vnto whō
they bare good wil.</p>

<p>Some were <em class="italic">Valasques</em> friends, and other
some his kinesfolkes, who letted not
to say openly, that <em class="italic">Cortez</em> by flattery, sutteltie and giftes
had gotten and obtayned his purpose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mischefe.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Tvvo hanged, and tvvo whipped.</div>

<p>And that the dissymulation in makyng hym selfe to
bee entreated and prayed to accepte that charge and
office, was a thing craftily fayned, whereby suche
election coulde not bee of anye value, and chieflye
without any such authority of the Ierome Friers dame,
who ruled and gouerned the <em class="italic">Indians</em> as chiefe presidents:
how muche more they hadde newes that <em class="italic">Iames Velasques</em>
had already obteyned the gouernement of that land, and
<em class="italic">Yucatan</em>. Then <em class="italic">Cortez</em> began to vnderstande in those matters,
and made informatiō who had raysed vp this rumoure,
and béeing knowen, he apprehended the chiefest,
and sent them prisoners aboorde his Ship: and to molifye
their wrath, he shortly releassed them agayne, the
which afterwards was cause of more mischief, for these
his enimies woulde haue fledde with a Vergantine and
killed the maister, pretending to flye vnto the Ilande of
<em class="italic">Cuba</em>, for to aduertise <em class="italic">Iames Velasques</em> of the great present
sent vnto the Emperour, to the intent it shoulde be taken
from their attorners passing néere the porte of <em class="italic">Hauana</em>,
with all the letters and relations of their businesse, bycause
the Emperoure shoulde not sée it, to conceyue well
of their procéedings. Then <em class="italic">Cortez</em> began to be agréeued
in earnest, and apprehended diuers of them, whose confessions
being taken, the matter was manifestly knowen
to be true, and therevppon according to the processe, hée
condemned those that were most culpable, and caused
forthwith two of them to be hanged, who were <em class="italic">Iohn Escudero</em>,
and <em class="italic">Iames Cermenio</em> pilot, and condemned <em class="italic">Gonsalo de
Vmbria</em> and <em class="italic">Alonso Penate</em> to be whipped, and incontinent
execution was done, all the rest being pardoned.</p>

<p>With this correction <em class="italic">Cortez</em> was more feared, and also
estéemed, than before he was, for certainely if he hadde
vsed gentlenesse, he should neuer haue tamed them, yea
and if he had not loked to them in time, he had bin spoyled:
for their pretence was, to haue aduertised <em class="italic">Iames Velasques</em>,
who would haue preuented them of their Shyps
and present, and yet afterwarde he sente a Caruell after
the sayd Ship, although it were too late.</p>

<img class="drop-cap isize7" src="images/i110.jpg" width="110" height="106" alt="" />
<em class="italic">Cortez</em> purposed to goe vnto <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and would
not gyue his Souldyers to vnderstand it, bycause
they shoulde not refuse the iourney,
through the talke of <em class="italic">Teudilli</em>, especially hearing
that the Citie of Mexico was situated vpon water,
whyche they imagined to be excéeding strong, as in effect
it was: and to the intent that they should all follow hym,
although againste their willes, he determined to spoyle
all his Shyppes, which was a strange case, perillous, and
a great losse. His intent throughly weyed, he little estéemed
the losse of his Shippes to withstand his men from
disturbance of his enterprise, for doubtlesse they woulde
haue stayed him, yea and rebelled, if they hadde knowen
his minde and pretended purpose. He did secretly accord
with one of the Maisters of hys Fléete in the nighte season
to bore holes in them, that thereby they myghte
synke, wythoute anye remedie to recouer them agayne.</p>

<p>Also he requested the other Maisters and Pylots to
publish among the army, that the Shyppes were so rotten
and wormeaten, that they were not fytte to goe to
sea agayne, and that they shoulde, when they chanced to
espye him and many of his Souldies togither, come and
certifie him openly of the estate and force of the sayde
Shippes, bycause that afterwardes they shoulde not laye
any fault to his charge.</p>

<p>According to this instruction, the Pylots and Maisters
did accomplish his commaundemente: for shortlye
after they espyed him among a flocke of his companye,
and then came they vnto him, saying: Sir, your nauie is
not to make any moe voyages, by reason that they are
all leake, and spoyled, rotten, and worme eaten, wherfore
according to our duetie, we do certifie you thereof, to prouide
therein as you shall see cause. All the Souldiers
gaue credite to their tale, bycause the Shippes had bin
there more than thrée monethes. And after long talke aboute
the matter, <em class="italic">Cortez</em> commaunded that they shoulde
profite themselues of them the best that they myght, and
as for the Hulles, let them sinke or runne a shore, fayning
great sorrow for so great a losse, and want of such prouision.
And in this manner they lette runne a shore fyue of
the best Shyppes, sauyng theyr Ordinance, vittayles,
sayles, Cables, Ankers, ropes, and all other tacle:
and shortely after they spoyled other foure vessels, but
that was done wyth some difficultie, bycause they
beganne to surmise the intente of <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, and beganne
openly to saye, that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> meant to carrie them to the
slaughter house. He then pacifyed them wyth gentle
wordes, saying, what is he that will refuse the warres
in so riche a Countrey? if there be any of you that wyll
leaue my companye, hée or they may (if please them) returne
to <em class="italic">Cuba</em> in a Shyppe that yet remayneth. And
this hée spake, to knowe howe many were the cowards,
meanyng in tyme of néede to haue no trust or confidence
in them. Then dyuers shamelesse persons demaunded
licence to returne to <em class="italic">Cuba</em>, but they were suche as loued
no warres. There wer also others that said nothing, who
woulde gladly haue retourned, séeyng the greatenesse
of the Countrey, and the multitude of the people,

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> knowing his souldyers mindes, commanded the
other Ship to be sunke, so that then they were all without
hope to goe out of that Countrey at y<sup>t</sup> time, exalting
and praysing the noble minde of <em class="italic">Cortes</em> shewed in that
worthy facte. Certaynely it was a déede necessary for the
present time, and done by the iudgement of a stout Captayne,
although he lost much by his Shyppes, and abode
without succour of the sea. There are few of these examples,
which are not of valiant personages, as was <em class="italic">Omiez

brake seauen Galleys and Foystes, to winne thereby

Euery day séemed long to <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, with the
desire to sée <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>. He nowe began
to publishe openly his iourney and departure,
and chose out of the body of his host
a hūdred and fiftie mē, which he thought
sufficient to leaue for safegard of the new
towne and fort, which was almost finished, and appoynted
<em class="italic">Pedro de Hircio</em> their Captaine, leauing with them
two Horses, and two small péeces of Ordinance, wyth
many <em class="italic">Indians</em> to serue them, and fiftie Townes round about
them in faithfull friendship and league, out of the
which Townes they might alwayes haue at their néede
fiftie thousande men of warre: and he departed with the
residue of his Spanyardes towarde <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em>, whyche
mighte be foure leagues from thence, and was scarcely
come to the Towne, when newes was broughte hym
that foure Shippes of <em class="italic">Francisco Garray</em> sayled along hys
coast, and were in sight of <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em>. With this newes
he returned incontinent with a hundred of his men, suspecting
euill of those Shippes. At his comming to <em class="italic">Vera
Crux</em>, his Captaine there enformed him how he had gone
himselfe to know what they were, and from whence they
came, and what they would, but coulde speake with none
of them. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> beyng informed how they roade at anker,
toke Captaine <em class="italic">Hircio</em> and certaine of his company to
expect their commyng ashore, suspectyng them muche, bicause
they roade so farre off, being by signes and tokens
willed to come into the Harbor. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> hauing wandered
neare thrée miles, mette with thrée Spaniardes whiche
came from the shippes, the one of them sayde that he was
a Notary, and the other twoo were to serue for witnesses
in their affayres, which was, to ascite and notifie certaine
wrytings, whiche they shewed not: and also to require
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> by vertue of the same, to come and make repartitiō
of that countrey with captayne <em class="italic">Garay</em> their generall, for
theyr sayd Captaine pretended that conquest (as first discouerer
of the same,) certifying moreouer that hée was
determined to inhabite twentie leagues distāt from that
place Westwarde neare vnto <em class="italic">Nahutlan</em>, whiche nowe is
called <em class="italic">Armeria</em>. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> answered, that they should returne
vnto their shippes, and to will theyr Captayne to come
to <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em> with his nauie, and there they woulde commune
togither aboute his comming, and if he stoode in
néede of any thing it shoulde be prouided. And if it were
(as they reported) that he was comen on the Kings affaires,
he woulde gladly fauour his procéedings, considering
that he and all his were there in seruice of his highnesse,
how muche more beyng all of one nation.</p>

<p>They answered, that in no wise their captaine nor none
of his army would come ashore, nor yet come where as
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> was. With this answere <em class="italic">Cortes</em> vnderstood the matter,
and layde holde of them, and went and placed himself
in ambushe behinde a little hill of sande, whiche stoode
right ouer agaynst the shippes, beyng neare sunne sette, &#38;
slepte there that night till daye approched, and the mornyng
farre spent, hopyng that <em class="italic">Garay</em> his Pilote or some of
his company woulde come ashore, meanyng likewise to
apprehende them for to be certified what course they had
made, and what hurte they had done, and findyng them
guiltie, to sende them prysoners into Spayne, likewise he
desired to knowe whether they had spoken with any vassals
of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, and seyng they came not a lande his
suspition was the greater.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A vvise practise.</div>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> commaunded thrée of his men to chaunge apparell
with the thrée messengers that came from <em class="italic">Garay</em>, and
this done, caused them to goe to the Sea side, wauyng
with theyr clokes, and callyng for the shippe boate, nowe
those of the shippes thought by theyr apparell that they
were their owne menne, and came with a dozen persons
in the skiffe with Crossebowes and Handgunnes. Then
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> his men whiche were clothed in other mens garments
hidde themselues among bushes, as who woulde
say, they were gone into the shadowe, for to flée from the
great heate of the Sunne, being at that time highe noone,
and bicause they should not be knowen.</p>

<p>The Mariners of the skiffe set a lande twoo men with
Hargabushes, and other two mē with Crossebowes, and
and <em class="italic">Indian</em> who went straight way to the bushes, thinkyng
to finde their fellowes. Then stept forth <em class="italic">Cortes</em> and caught
them before they coulde gette aborde the skiffe, although
they meant to haue defended themselues, so that one of
them who was a Pilote, hauing his Hargabushe ready
charged, &#38; would haue shot at captaine <em class="italic">Hircio</em>, &#38; assuredly
if his match and pouder had bene good he had slayne him.
When the general aborde the ships perceiued this deceit,
would abide no longer, &#38; cōmaunded to make saile, not tarying
for his skiffe. By these seuen mē taken at two times
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> was satisfied, &#38; also certified how captain <em class="italic">Garay</em> had
sayled along the coast séeking <em class="italic">Florida</em>, and arriued in a riuer,
the King of that prouince was called <em class="italic">Panuco</em>, where
they founde little golde, barteryng aborde their shippes,
all theyr golde passed not thrée thousande Castelins, but
in exchaunge of things of small value, nothing contented
<em class="italic">Garay</em> on that voyage, bycause the quantitie of golde was
small and not fine.</p>

<p>With this newes <em class="italic">Cortes</em> returned to <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em> with
his men which he brought in his company: and there concluded
and fully agreed with those <em class="italic">Indians</em> to pull downe
theyr Idols &#38; sepulchres of their <em class="italic">Cassikz</em>, whiche they did
reuerence as Gods, perswading them to worship the God
of heauen. And after this doctrine their league of friendship
was effectually established, and with other townes
adioyning against <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>. Those <em class="italic">Indians</em> gaue vnto
him gagues to be alwayes faithfull of worde &#38; promisse,
and offered vnto him as many men fitte for warre &#38; seruice
as he would require. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> receiued the gagues which
were of the principallest persons of the townes, as <em class="italic">Mamexi
Teuch</em>, and <em class="italic">Tamalli</em>, he tooke also a thousand <em class="italic">Tamemes</em>,
that is to say, men that are carriars, who ordinarily taketh
his burden vpon his backe which is halfe a hundred
waight, and those fellowes followe the campe with their
bagge &#38; bagage: These men serued for horses to draw the
ordinance, and to carrie other munition and victuals.</p>

<em class="italic">Cortes</em> departed frō <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em>, leauing that
towne named <em class="italic">Siuillia</em>, towarde <em class="italic">Mexico</em> the
sixtene day of August of the same yéere,
with 400. Spaniardes and fiftene horses,
&#38; sixe péeces of ordinance, and 1300. <em class="italic">Indians</em>
w<sup>t</sup> the carriers &#38; mē of <em class="italic">Cuba</em>. And whē <em class="italic">Cortes</em> departed frō
<em class="italic">Zempoallan</em> he had not one vassall of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> in his
campe to leade them the way towarde <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, for al were
fledde, seing the new league, or else by commaundement
of their Lord, and the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em> knew not well
the way.</p>

<p>The first thrée dayes iourney the army passed through
countrey of their friendes, and were louingly receyued
and lodged, especially in <em class="italic">Xalapan</em>. The fourth day they
came to <em class="italic">Sicuchimatl</em>, whiche is a strong place situated on
a hill side very craggy, and the way to passe therevnto is
made with force of mans hande as a stayre. And if the
inhabitants thereof would haue resisted the entraunce,
with greate difficultie bothe footemen &#38; horsemen mought
haue entred the towne, but as afterwarde appeared, they
were commaunded by <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> to lodge them and also
to honour them. The rulers of that towne sayde to <em class="italic">Cortes</em>,
that for as muche as he wente to visite their Prince
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, he should assure himselfe that they were and
would be his friendes. This towne hath many villages
and farmes beneath in the playne, for <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> was alwayes
prouided there of .5000. men of warre.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> gaue great thankes to the Lorde for his curtesie
and good entertaynement, muche estéeming the good will
of his Lorde <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, and so departed from thence, and
wente to passe ouer a mountayne very high, the passage
whereof he named <em class="italic">Nombre de dios</em>, bycause it was the first
that he had passed, beyng so asperous and highe, that there
is none suche in all Spayne, for it conteyned directly vpright
thrée leagues, and hath in many places grapes and
trées with hony. And discendyng downe on the other side
of that hill, they came to a towne called <em class="italic">Theuhixuacan</em>,
whiche is a forte and friende to <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, where our army
was receyued and entertayned as in the other towne
behinde.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Troubles.</div>

<p>And from thence he traueled thrée dayes in a countrey
inhabitable, and passed some necessitie of hunger, &#38; much
more of thirst, bicause all the water that they founde was
saltishe, and many of his men for wante of other dranke
thereof, whereof they fell into sickenesse: and sodainely fel
a meruaylous Hayle with great colde, whiche increased
their griefe, yea and the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of their company thought
there to ende theyr liues, &#38; some of the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Cuba</em> died
there through nakednesse, not being accustomed to so cold
a countrey. After the fourth iourney of euill way they ascended
vp an other hil, and vpon the toppe therof, (to their
iudgement) they founde a thousande carte loade of wood
ready cut, neare to a little tower of idolles: they named
that place the porte of wood: &#38; hauing passed twoo leagues
from the porte of wood, they founde the countrey barren
and poore, but soone after the army came to a place whiche
they named white Castell, bicause the Lordes house was
of stone very white and newe, and the beste that they had
séene in all that countrey, and so curiously wrought, that
they meruayled thereat: that towne in their language is
called <em class="italic">Zaclotan</em>, and the valley neare vnto it is name <em class="italic">Zacatami</em>,
and the Lordes name is <em class="italic">Olintlec</em>, who receyued
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> honorably, and prouided for him and his company
abundantly, being so commaunded by <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, as hée
reported afterwarde.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A straunge ioy.</div>

<p>And in token that he had receyued that cōmission from
his Lorde, he commaunded fiftie men to be sacrificed for
ioy, whose bloud they sawe newe and freshe. The townes
men of that towne caried the Spanyardes on their shoulders,
on suche beares as we carry dead men to Churche.
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> enformed them (by his enterpreters) of the cause of
his comming into that countrey, as he had vsed in other
places, &#38; demaunded whether he the Lorde of this towne
were tributary to <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>. This <em class="italic">Cazike</em> being amazed
at his question, answered, saying: What is he that is not
eyther slaue or vassall to the great <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>. Then <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
certified him, who and what the Emperour king of
Spayne was, willing him to be his friend and seruitour,
&#38; further enquired if he had any golde to sende him some.
This <em class="italic">Cazike</em> answered that he would do nothing without
the commaundement of his Lorde, nor yet send his king
any golde although he had inough. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> dissimuled the
matter, and helde his peace, yet by and by he desired to
knowe the Maiestie and mightie power of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
the <em class="italic">Cazike</em> answered, that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> was Lorde of the
whole worlde, and that he had thirtie Vassals who were
able to make a .100000. men of warre: eche one of them he
also certified that he sacrificed .20000. men yerely to his
Goddes: And also his dwellyng was in the most beautyfullest
and strongest cittie of al that euer was enhabited,
likewise (quoth he) his house and courte is moste greate,
noble, and replenished with Gentlemen, his riches incredible,
and his charges excessiue. And truely therein he
sayde the very troth, excepte in the sacrifice wherein he
something enlarged, although the slaughter of men for sacrifice
in euery temple was very great, yea and some hold
opinion, that some yéeres were sacrificed aboue .50000.
men. Being in this conuersation, came two Gentilmen of
that valley to sée the Spanyardes, and eche of them presented
vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em> foure women slaues, &#38; certayne collers
of golde of small price. <em class="italic">Olintlec</em> although he was vassall
to <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, was a greate Lorde, and had .20000. vassals,
and thirtie wiues altogither in his house, beside a
hundreth other women that attended vpon them. And had
for his garde and houshold .2000. persons, his towne was
great, &#38; had .13. temples in it, &#38; eche temple many idolles of
stone of diuers fashiōs, before whom they sacrificed men,
doues, quayles, &#38; other things w<sup>t</sup> perfumes &#38; great
veneratiō. In this place and territorie, <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> had .5000.
souldiers in garrison, and ordinarie postes from thence
to <em class="italic">Mexico</em>. Vntill this time, <em class="italic">Cortez</em> had not so amply vnderstoode
the mighte and power of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, yea and
though many inconueniences, difficulties, feare, and such
like, did represent it selfe vnto him in his iourney to <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,
whiche perhaps would haue amazed some valiāt persons,
yet he shewed not one iote of cowardise, hauyng
hearde suche a reporte of that mightie Prince, but rather
his desire was so much the more to sée hym.</p>

<p>Considering now that he shoulde passe through <em class="italic">Taxcallon</em>
to goe to <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, being <em class="italic">Taxcallon</em> a greate &#38; strong
Citie, and warlike people, he dispatched four <em class="italic">Zeampoallanezes</em>
to the Lordes and Captaynes of that Citie, on the
behalfe of <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em> and his owne, offering vnto them
his friendship and fauour, giuing them to vnderstande,
that those few Christians woulde come vnto their Citie
to serue thē, desiring thē to accept the same, thinking assuredly
that those of <em class="italic">Taxcallon</em> would haue done with him
as the <em class="italic">Zempoallanezes</em> had done, which were both good and
faithful, who had always vsed trouth with him, euē so he
thought that now he moughte credite them, for they had
enformed him, that the <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em> were their friendes,
and so would be his, considering that they were vtter enimies
to <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, and willingly would goe with him
to the siege of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, with desire of libertie, and to reuenge
olde iniuries and griefes, whiche they had susteyned
many yeares before of the people of <em class="italic">Culhua</em>. <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
refreshed himselfe in <em class="italic">Zaclotan</em> fiue dayes, where is a fresh
riuer and quiet folke, pulling downe the Idolles, and placed
a remembrance of Christ crucifyed, as he hadde done
in all the Townes that he had passed.</p>

<p>He toke his leaue of <em class="italic">Olintlec</em>, leauing him wel pleased, &#38;
went to a town two leagues frō thēce along y<sup>e</sup> riuer side,
whereof was Lorde <em class="italic">Iztacmixtlitan</em>, one of the Gentlemen
who had giuen him the slaues and collers of golde.</p>

<p>This towne standeth in a playne grounde of two leagues
compasse, which is replenished with so many houses
as doth séeme to touche one an other, in that way that
our army passed&#8212;and the towne it selfe doth contayne fiue
thousande householdes, standing on a hill, and on the one
side thereof is the Lordes house with a strong forte, being
the beste yet séene in those parties, walled with good
stone with barbucan and déepe ditche. There <em class="italic">Cortes</em> rested
himselfe thrée dayes, abiding the foure messengers
whiche he sent from <em class="italic">Zacloton</em>, to knowe the answere that
should be brought.</p>

<em class="italic">Cortes</em> seyng the long tarying of the messengers
he departed from <em class="italic">Zaclotan</em> without
any intelligence from <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>. Our cāp
had not marched much after their departure
from that place, but they came to
a great circuite of stone made without lyme or morter,
being of a fadom and a half high, and twentie foote brode
with loupe holes, to shoote at: that wall crossed ouer all
the valley from one mountayne to another, and but one
onely entraunce or gate, in the whiche the one wall doubled
against the other, and the way there was fourtie
paces brode, in such sort, that it was an euill and perilous
passage, if any had bene there to defend it. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> demaunded
the cause of that circuite, and who had buylte it,
<em class="italic">Iztacmixtlitan</em> that wente to beare him company, tolde
him that it was but a deuision from their countrey and
<em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, and that their antecessors had made the same
to disturbe the entrance of the <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em> in time of
warre, who came to robbe and murther them, bycause of
the friendship betwixte them and <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, whose vassals
they were.</p>

<p>That strange and costly wall, séemed a thing of greate
maiestie to our Spanyardes, and more superfluous than
profitable, yet they suspected that the <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em> were
valiant warriers, who had suche defense made agaynst
them. And as <em class="italic">Cortes</em> and his army stoode beholding thys
worke, <em class="italic">Iztacmixtlitan</em> thought he had bin afrayde to procéede
forward, and prayed him (for so much as he was his
Lordes friend) not to passe that way, nor yet through the
Countrey of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, for so muche as he wente to visite
his maister, for (quoth he) if they knowe you to be my
Lordes friende, they will séeke youre displeasure, as they
haue done to others, and I will prouide you of guides to
leade you continually through the dominion of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
where you shall be well receyued and prouided, vntil
you come to <em class="italic">Mexico</em>.</p>

<p>But <em class="italic">Mamexi</em> and the others of <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em> willed hym
to refuse that offer and counsell in any wise, alleadgyng
that it was an onely pretence to separate them from the
friendship of that prouince, whose people were good, honorable,
and valiant, and that <em class="italic">Iztacmixtlitans</em> perswasion
was to prohibite theyr helpe and succoure agaynst <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
willing hym earnestly to giue no credite vnto
hys sayings, for he and his allyes are false Traytors,
and meante to bryng hym into some snare, where they
myghte kill both him and his company, and féede vppon
theyr fleshe.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> for a space was amazed at y<sup>e</sup> talke of y<sup>e</sup> one and
the other, but in conclusion he accepted the councell of
<em class="italic">Mamexi</em>, for that he hadde conceyued a better opinion of
the <em class="italic">Zeampoallanezes</em> his allyed friendes, than of the
others. And setting all feare asyde, he tooke the way to
<em class="italic">Tlaxcallon</em>, byddyng <em class="italic">Iztacmixtlitā</em> farewell, and with thrée
hundred Souldyers on a ranke, he entred the way in the
wall, and procéeded in good order all the way forwardes,
carrying the Ordinance ready charged, and he himselfe
the leader of all his army, yea and sometimes he woulde
be halfe a league before them, to discouer and make the
way playne.</p>

<p>And hauing gone the space of thrée leagues from that
circuite, he commaunded his footemen to make hast, bycause
it was somewhat late, and he with his Horsemen
went to descrye the way forwardes, who ascendyng vp a
hyll, two of the formost horsemenne mette with fiftéene
<em class="italic">Indians</em> armed with swordes and Targets and tuffes of
feathers, whiche they vse to weare in the warres. These
fiftéene were spyes, and when they sawe the Horsemen,
they beganne to flye with feare, or else to gyue aduise.</p>

<p>Then approched <em class="italic">Cortez</em> with other thrée horsemen,
calling to them to stay, but by no meanes they woulde
abyde: then syxe Horsemen ranne after them, and ouertooke
them, &#38; ioyned all togither, with determination rather
to dye than to yéelde, shewing them signes to stande
still: yet the Horsemen comming to lay handes on them,
they prepared themselues to battayle, and foughte, defendyng
themselues for a whyle. In thys fyghte the <em class="italic">Indians</em>
slewe two of theyr Horses, and as the <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em>
doe witnesse, at two blowes they cutte off a
Horse head, bridle and all. Then came the rest of the
Horsemenne, and the army approched, for there were
in syghte néere fiue thousande <em class="italic">Indians</em> in good order, to
succoure theyr fiftéene fyghting menne, but they came
too late for that purpose, for they were all slayne wyth
the anger that was taken for the killyng of the two
Horses, and woulde not render themselues in tyme:
yet notwythstandyng theyr fellowes foughte, vntyll
they espyed oure armye commyng, and the Ordinance,
then they returned, leauyng the fielde to oure menne,
but oure Horsemenne followed them, and slewe aboute

lykewyse that those with whome hée hadde fought were

sorowfull for that whyche hadde passed: and for so
muche as it happened in theyr Countrey, they woulde
willingly pay for the two Horses whyche were slayne,
praying them to come in good time to theyr Towne,
who woulde gladly receyue them, and enter into theyr
league of friendshippe, bycause they séemed to bée valiante

<p>Yet <em class="italic">Cortes</em> beléeued them, and gaue them thankes for

he required nothyng, for within shorte space he expected
many moe: but yet God knoweth how sorowfull he
was for the want of them, and not only so much for thē,
as that the <em class="italic">Indians</em> shoulde thinke that Horses could dye,
or be slayne.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> procéeded forwardes aboute two leagues
where the Horses were kylled, although it was almost
Sunnesette, and his men wéeried, hauing trauelled farre
that day.</p>

<p>His will was, to haue pitched his Camp in a strong
place of water: wherefore he planted his army by a Riuer
side, whereas they remayned all that night with good
watche both of footemen and horsemen, fearing some assault:
but there was no attempt giuen that night, whereby
they might haue taken better rest, than they were aware
of.</p>

The next morning at Sunne rising, <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
departed with his army in good order, and
in the middest of them wente the fardage
and artillerie, and as soone as they were
come to a little Village there néere at
hande, they mette with the other two messengers
of <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em>, who departed from them at <em class="italic">Zaclotan</em>:
they came with pitifull chéere, exclayming of the
Captaynes of the power of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, who had bounde
them, and deteyned them from returning: but with good
fortune, that nighte they hadde broken loose, and
escaped, for otherwise in the morning following, they
had bin sacrificed to the God of Victory, and after the sacrifice,
to be eaten, for a good beginning of their warres,
protesting the like to be done with the berded men, and
with as many as came with them.</p>

<p>They had no sooner tolde their tale, when there appeared
behinde a little hill about a thousande <em class="italic">Indians</em>, verye
well appoynted after their fashion, and came with suche
a maruellous noyse and crye, as though theyr voyces
shoulde haue pearced the Heauens, hurling at oure

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> made many tokens of peace vnto them, and by
his interpreters desired them to leaue the battell. But so
much the more as he entreated for peace, the more hastie
and earnest were they, thinkyng either to haue ouercomen
them, or else to holde them play, to the entēt that the
Spanyardes should haue folowed them to a certaine ambushe
that was prepared for them, of more then .80000.
men, whiche they had planted in a créeke of a riuer which
abutted vpō the high way. Then our men began to cease
from wordes, and to lay hande vpon their weapons, for
that company of a thousande were as many, as on our
side were fighting men, they were well practised in the
warres, very valiāt, and also pitched in a better place for
fight. This battell endured certaine houres, and at the
ende the <em class="italic">Indians</em> being eyther wearied, or else meanyng to
take our men in the snare appointed, began to flie toward
theyr maine battell, not as ouercome, but to ioyne with
their owne folke. And our men being hote in the fight
and slaughter whiche was not litle, followed them with
all their fardage, and vnwares fell into the ambushe among
an infinite number of <em class="italic">Indians</em> armed, they stayde
not bycause they would not put themselues out of order,
and passed through their campe with great haste &#38; feare.
The enimies began to sette vpon the horsemen, thinkyng
to haue taken their lances from them, their courage was
so stoute: many of the Spaniardes had there perished, had
it not bin for the <em class="italic">Indian</em> friends. Likewise the courage of
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> did much animate them, for although he ledde his
army making way yet, diuers times, he turned him
backe to place his men in order and to comforte them,
and at length came out of that daungerous way into the
playne fielde, where the horses mought helpe, and the ordinaunce
stande in stéede, whiche two things did greatly
anoy the enimie to their great wonder and maruell, and
at the sight thereof began to flie.</p>

<p>In bothe encounters remayned many <em class="italic">Indians</em> slayne
and wounded, and of the Spaniardes some were hurt, but
none killed, giuyng moste hartie thankes vnto God for
their deliuery from so great a multitude of <em class="italic">Indians</em> their
enimies with muche ioye and pleasure of the victory.
Then they wente to pitche their campe in a village called
<em class="italic">Teoacazinco</em>, where was a little Tower and a Temple,
and there fortified themselues, and buylte cotages of
bowes and strawe. The <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Zeampoallan</em>, and those
of <em class="italic">Iztacmixtlitan</em> did play the valiant men that day, wherfore
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> honoured them with harty thankes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The care of good souldiers.</div>

<p>This day was the first of September. The night followyng
our men slepte not quietly with feare of inuasion
of their enimies, but they came not, for they neuer vse to
fighte in the nighte season. And as soone as it was day
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> sente to the Captaynes of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, to requyre
them of peace and friendshippe, willyng them quietly to
suffer the passage through their countrey to <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, for
that they meant them no hurte but rather good will. This
done, hée lefte twoo hundreth Spanyardes and the Carreirs
in the campe. And tooke with him other twoo hundreth,
with seuen hundreth <em class="italic">Indians</em>, and wente with them
abrode to skirmishe in the face of their enimies, and at
that tyme burned fiue or sixe villages, and returned with
foure hundreth prysoners, without receyuyng any hurte,
although they followed him to his campe. At his returne
he founde the answere of the Captaynes his enimies,
whiche was, that the next day they would come and talke
with him and declare theyr mindes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">150000. men.</div>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> was well preuented that night, for the answere
liked him not, but rather séemed braue, and a matter determined
to be done as they had sayde: lykewise those
whiche were taken prysoners, certified that his enimies
were ioyned togither to the nūber of a .150000. mē to giue
him battaile the next day folowing, &#38; to swallow thē aliue
whom so mortally they did hate, thinking thē to be friēds
to <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, vnto whom they wished all euil &#38; mischief.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indian armour.</div>

<p>It was moste true that the <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em> had gathered
all their whole power to apprehende the bearded menne,
and to make of them a more solemne sacrifice vnto their
Goddes, than at any time heretofore they had done, with
a generall banquet of their flesh, which they called Celestial.
The Captaines of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em> deuided their souldiers
into foure battayles, the one to <em class="italic">Tepeticpac</em>, another to <em class="italic">Ocotelulco</em>,
the third to <em class="italic">Tizatlan</em>, and the fourth to <em class="italic">Quiahuiztlan</em>,
that is to say, the men of the Mountaynes, the men
of the Lymepittes, the men of the Pinetrées, and the water
men, euery of these had their Lardes and Captaynes
whome they shoulde repayre vnto and obey, and all these
foure sortes of men dothe make the body of the common
weale and cittie, and also commaunde both in tyme of
warre and peace. So that euery of these Captaynes had
his iust portion or number of warriers, but the general of
al the whole army was called <em class="italic">Xicotencatl</em>, who was of the
Limepits: and he had the standart of the cittie, which is a
Crane of gold with his wings spred, adorned with Emeralds
&#38; siluerworke, which standart is according to their
vse, either caried before the whole host or else behinde thē
all. The second Captaine or Lieuetenant was <em class="italic">Maxixcazin</em>,
&#38; the number of the whole army was .150000. men.
Such a great number they had ready against .400. Spaniardes
&#38; yet at length ouercome: neuerthelesse after all
this broyle, they were most greatest friends. These foure
captains came w<sup>t</sup> their cōpany that the fields where they
were séemed a forest. They were trimme felowes &#38; well
armed according to their vse, although they were paynted
so that their faces shewed like diuels with great tuffes of
feathers and triumphed gallantly. They had also slinges,
staues, speares, swordes, bowes and arrowes, skulles,
splintes, gantlettes all of wood, gilte or else couered with
feathers or leather, their corselets were made of cotten
woolle, their targettes and bucklers gallant and strong,
made of woodde couered with leather, and trimmed with
laton and feathers, theyr swordes were staues with an
edge of flint stone cunningly ioyned into the staffe, which
woulde cutte very well and make a sore wounde.</p>

<p>The host (as is declared) was deuided into foure parts,
their instrumentes of warre were hunters hornes, and
drummes called attabals made like a caldron and couered
with vellam. So that the Spanyardes in all the discouery
of <em class="italic">India</em> did neuer sée a better army togither nor
better ordered.</p>

These <em class="italic">Indians</em> were great braggers, and
sayde among themselues, what madde
people are these that threatneth vs and
yet knoweth vs not. But if they will be
so bolde to inuade our countrey without
our licence, let vs not sette vpon them so
soone, it is méete they haue a litle reste, for we haue tyme
inough to take &#38; binde them, let vs also sende them meate
for they are commen with empty stomackes: And againe
they shall not say that we do apprehende them with wearinesse
and hunger. Wherevpon they sent vnto the Christians
thrée hundreth Gynnea cockes, and two hundreth
baskets of bread called <em class="italic">Centli</em>. The whiche present was a
great sucker for the néede that they stoode in. And soone after
(quoth they) nowe let vs goe and sette vpon them, for
by this time they haue eaten their meate, and nowe wée
will eate them, and so shall they pay vs the victuals that
we sent: likewise we wil know if <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> commaunded
them to come into our countrey, or who else. And if he
sente them, then let him come and deliuer them: and if it
be their owne enterpryse, they shall receyue theyr reward
accordingly. These and such like bragges they vsed, seing
so fewe Spaniardes before them, and not knowyng their
strength. Then the foure Captaynes sente twoo thousande
of their valiantest men of warre and olde Souldiers,
to take the Spanyardes quietly, with commaundement
that if they did resist, either to binde them or else to
kill them, meanyng not to sette their whole army vpon
them, saying that they shoulde gette but small honour for
so great a multitude, to fight agaynst so fewe. The twoo
thousande Souldiers passed the trench that was betwixt
the twoo campes, and came boldely to the Tower where
the Christians were. Then came foorth the Horsemen,
and after them the footemen, and at the first encounter
they made the <em class="italic">Indians</em> féele howe the yron swordes
woulde cutte: and at the seconde, they shewed of what
force those fewe in number were, of whome a little before
they had so iested: But at the thirde brunte they
made those lusty Souldiers fly, who were come to apprehende
them, for none of them escaped, but onely suche as
knewe the passage of the trenches or ditche.</p>

<p>Then the mayne battell and whole army sette foorth
with a terrible and maruellous noyse, and came so fierce
vppon our menne, till they entred into our campe without
any resistaunce, and there were at handye strokes
and wrastlyng with the Spanyardes, and in a good space
coulde not gette them out, killyng many of them whiche
were so bolde to enter: and in this sorte they fought
foure howers, before they coulde make way among
their enimies. And then the <em class="italic">Indians</em> began to faynt, seyng
so many dead on theyr side, and the greate woundes they
had, and that they coulde kill none of the Christians: yet
the battayle ceased not till it drewe neare night and then
they retyred. Whereof <em class="italic">Cortes</em> and his Souldiers were excéedyng
gladde, for they were fully weried with killyng
of <em class="italic">Indians</em>, so that all that nighte our men triumphed with
more ioy than feare, consideryng that the <em class="italic">Indians</em> fought
not by night, they slepte and tooke their reste at pleasure,
whiche they had not done til that tyme, but alwayes kept
bothe watche and warde.</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">Indians</em> finding many of their hoste missyng, yet
they would not yéelde themselues as ouercome, as after
did appeare. They coulde not well tell howe many were
slayne, nor yet our men had leasure to count them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cortes vvas a painfull man.</div>

<p>The nexte day in the mornyng <em class="italic">Cortes</em> wente forth to
runne the fieldes as he had done before, leauing halfe his
menne to kéepe the campe, and bicause he shoulde not be
espied he departed before day, &#38; burned aboute .x. townes,
and sacked one towne, whiche was of thrée thousande
houses, in the whiche were founde but few folke of fight,
bycause the moste of them were gone to their campe: After
the spoyle, he set fire on the towne and came his way
to his campe with a great pray by noone time. The enimies
pursued thinkyng to take away their pray, and followed
them into the camp, where they fought fiue houres
and could not kill one Spaniarde, although many of their
side were slaine: for euen as they were many and stoode on
a throng togither, the ordinaunce made a wonderfull
spoyle among them, so that they lefte off fighting, and the
victory remayned for our men. The <em class="italic">Indians</em> thought that
the Spanyardes were inchaunted bycause their arrowes
coulde not hurte them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A straunge presente.</div>

<p>The nexte day followyng, the foure Captaynes sente
thrée seuerall things in present to <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, and the messengers
that brought them sayd: Sir behold here fiue slaues,
and if thou be that rigorous God that eatest mans fleshe
and bloud, eate these whiche we bring vnto thée, and we
will bring thée moe. And if thou be the gentle and méeke
God, beholde here Franckinsense and Feathers. And if
thou be mortal man, take here foule, bread, &#38; Cherries.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> answered, that both he and his were mortal men
euen as they were. And bicause that alwayes he had vsed
to tell them trouth, wherfore did they vse to tell him lies,
and lykewise to flatter him, for he desired to bée their
friende, aduising them not to be madde and stubborne in
their opinion, for if they so did, assuredly they shoulde receyue
great hurte and dammage. Likewise (quoth he) it
is apparant vnto you how many of your side are slayne
without the losse of one of mine, and with this answere
sent them away. Notwithstanding the answere sent, there
came aboute .30000. of them euen to <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his campe to
proue their Corselettes, as they had done the day before,
but they returned with brokē pates. Here is to be noted,
that although the first day the whole host of <em class="italic">Indians</em> came
to combat with our men, &#38; finally all they came to fight,
yet the next day they did not so, but euery seueral captaine
by himselfe, for to deuide the better the trauayle &#38; paynes
equally amōg them: &#38; bicause that one should not disturbe
another through y<sup>e</sup> multitude, considering that they should
fight but with a few, &#38; in a narrow place, &#38; for this consideration,
their battayles were more fresher &#38; stronger, for
eche captaine did contende who should do most valiantly,
for to get honour, &#38; especially in killyng one Spaniarde,
for they thought that all their hurtes shoulde be satisfied
with the death of one Spaniarde, or taking one prisoner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indian policie.</div>

<p>Likewyse is to bée considered, the straungenesse of
their battayle, for not withstandyng their controuersse
all those fiftene dayes that they were there, whether they
fought or no. The <em class="italic">Indians</em> sente vnto the Spanyardes
cakes of breade, Gynnea cockes and Cherries. But this
polycie was not to giue them that meate for good will,
but onely to espie and sée what hurte was done amongst
them, and also to sée what feare or stomacke they had
to procéede: but the Spanyardes fell not into that reckenyng,
for the espies of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em> sayde, that none had
fought with them but certayne outlawes and knaues
called <em class="italic">Otomies</em>, who lyued as vagaboundes without a
Lorde or other ruler: And that they were théeues, who
had theyr abyding behinde a hill, whiche they poynted vnto

The nexte day after these presentes were
sente vnto them as Goddes, whiche was
the sixte of September, there came to the
Campe fiftie <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, whiche
séemed after theyr sorte honest menne, and
gaue vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em> bread, cherries, &#38; Gynnea cocks, as they
ordinarily vsed to do, enquiring how all his Spaniardes
did and what they meant to doe, and whether they stoode
in necessitie of any thing. And after this communication
they went vp and downe the camp, gasing and beholding
the horses, armour and artillery, and seemed amased to
sée such things. But the effect of their cōming was the office
of espies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The good aduise of a friende.</div>

<p><em class="italic">Teuche</em> of <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em> marking these things, who being
of a childe brought vp in wars, by reason wherof he was
expert and wise, came vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, saying, sir it semeth not
well, y<sup>t</sup> these <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em> wander vp &#38; downe your campe
beholding the entrance and going out of the same, to beholde
likewise the fortitude and weakenesse of youre power,
I like it not: It may please you to make enquirie
whether they be espyes or no. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> hauing heard hys
tale, gaue him hartie thankes for his good aduice, yea
and maruelled, that neyther he himselfe, nor none of his
Spanyardes had noted the thing, the <em class="italic">Indians</em> hauing so
many dayes come vnto them after this sort, yea and that
only <em class="italic">Indian</em> of <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em> had considered it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confessiō.</div>

<p>Nowe the originall cause was not bycause <em class="italic">Teuch</em> was
more wise than the Christians, but by reason that hée
had séene and heard those <em class="italic">Indians</em> commune with the subiectes
of <em class="italic">Iztacmixtlitan</em> to féele their mindes, and wyth
craft and subtiltie to obteyne their desire: whereby <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
vnderstoode that those fellowes came not to any good
purpose: he apprehended that <em class="italic">Indian</em> whiche stoode nexte
vnto him, and hauing him alone from his fellowes, by
his interpreters examined him effectually, who incontinent
confessed that he was a spye, and that his comming
thither was to view the way how to enter their Campe
for to spoyle and burne their Tentes: and for so much as
they hadde proued fortune all the houres of the day, and
all happened contrary to their desire, against their auncient
fame and glory which they hadde obteyned by noble
exploytes in warres, they now meant to proue their successe
by nighte, hoping of better fortune: and also bycause
their souldiers shoulde not feare the Horses, with the
darkenesse of the nighte, nor the blowes or stripes of the
bright swordes, nor yet the fire and terrible noyse of the
Ordinance: and that Captayne <em class="italic">Xicoteucatl</em> was alreadye
appoynted for that enterprise, with prouision of manye
thousand souldiers which lay in ambush in a vale behind
certayne hilles, right ouer against their Campe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A good correction.</div>

<p>After this confession taken, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> full prudently
commaunded to take also the severall confessions of other
foure or fyue, who likewise confessed that they were all
espies, vppon whose confessions the were al fiftie taken
prisoners, and iudgmente giuen, that their one hande
should be cut off, which was forthwith executed, and then
were returned to their Camp, signifying vnto them that
the like iustice should be executed vpon as many espyes
as they might take. And also they were charged to shew
vnto their Generall who had sente them, that both daye
and night he would be ready for them.</p>

<p>When the <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em> sawe their espyes come in thys
pickle, they were in a maruellous feare, and it séemed a
newe world vnto them: they also beléeued that oure men
hadde some familiar spirites that did instructe them of
their thoughtes, and with feare of cutting off hāds, there
went no moe espies with victuals.</p>

out of our Campe a great multitude

that they were those that the Captayne
<em class="italic">Xicotencatl</em> hadde in ambush: and although
it was néere night, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> determined
to followe them, and not to abide their comming,
fearing that at a first brunt they mighte set fire among
his cotages, as was pretended among them, whiche pretence
hauing taken effecte, myght haue bin the destruction
of all his men, eyther by the fier or otherwise: wherefore
he put all his men in good order, and commaunded

<div class="sidenote">Ambassage from Mutezuma.</div>

<p>At that season were come sixe noble men from <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,
who brought two hundred seruing men to wayt vpon

hundred garments of cotten, and some of feathers, and a
thousand péeces of golde.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Excuses.</div>

<p>These ambassadors on the behalfe of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, declared,
that their Lord would be friende with the Emperoure,
and also with him, and his company, requestyng
to knowe what tribute he woulde yearely demaunde, in
golde, plate, pearles, slaues, or garments, or of any other
thing that was within his kingdome, and the same tribute
he woulde well and truly pay withoute delay, wyth
such condition, that neyther he nor his company shoulde
come vnto <em class="italic">Mexico</em>. And this request (quoth they) is not
only bycause you should bée disturbed to come into hys
countrey, but chiefly bycause the waye is euill, barren,
and full of euill rockes, whyche lette dothe gréeue <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
that suche valiant menne as ye be shoulde suffer

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> dyd thankefully receyue the present and gentle

<p>Then <em class="italic">Cortez</em> fel into an ague, for which cause he went

to make his Camp strong against certaine flockes
of <em class="italic">Indians</em>, whiche came dayly to skirmishe, for that was
as ordinarie, as the meate that was wont to be broughte
to thē: but yet these skirmishes nor furie of y<sup>e</sup> <em class="italic">Indiās</em> were
not like to their fierce beginning.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> now meaneth to take a purgation for his ague:
and tooke certayne pilles whiche he broughte with him
from <em class="italic">Cuba</em>, at suche houre of the nighte as is vsed for purgations.</p>

<p>It happened that the nexte daye following, before hys
purge had wrought, came thrée great companies of <em class="italic">Indians</em>
to besiege his Camp. It should séeme that those <em class="italic">Indians</em>
had some intelligence of his sicknesse, or else thinking
with feare that he durst not come abroade as he was
wont to doe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A valiant Captayne.</div>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> being aduertised of this newes, withoute anye
more respect to his purgation taken, tooke his horse, and
with his menne came to the encounter, and foughte with
his enimies all day till it was nighte, and draue them a
good way off, to their great hurt, and then returned to his
Camp, and the next day following, he purged as fresh, as
though it had bin newly taken. I doe not rehearse thys
for a miracle but to declare what he passed: for <em class="italic">Hernando
Cortez</em> was a greate sufferer of trauell and paynes, and
one of y<sup>e</sup> firste that alway was at any assay or brunt of enimies,
and he was not onely a good man of his handes,
but also graue in counsell. And hauing thus purged hym
selfe, and taken rest those dayes, he watched euery night
that fell to his lotte, as well as any other souldier, and so
continually he vsed to do. He was not for this the lesse estéemed,
but rather muche the more beloued among hys
men.</p>

In an euening <em class="italic">Cortes</em> went vp to the toppe
of his Tower, and looking rounde aboute
hym, he espyed aboute foure leagues distant
in the Mountaynes among rockes
and procéeding out of a wodde dyuers
smokes, whereby he ymagined people to
be there: he opened not his minde to anye man, but commaunded
two hundred of his men to followe hym, and
some <em class="italic">Indians</em> hys friendes, and within thrée or foure
houres of the nyghte he toke hys iourney towarde the
Mountaynes, béeing very darke. He had not fully gone a
league, when suddaynely appeared the lykenesse of a
great Bull whiche ouerthrewe them that they could not
stirre. The firste Horseman béeing fallen, they aduysed
<em class="italic">Cortez</em> thereof, who aunswered, that he shoulde returne
wyth hys Horse to the Campe: and incontinente fell another,
<em class="italic">Cortez</em> commaunded hym the lyke: and when
thrée or foure were fallen, his company retyred, saying,
it was an euill token, desiring him to returne and abyde
the morning, that they myghte sée whether they wente.
He aunswered, saying, yée oughte to gyue no credite to
witchcraftes or fantasies, for God, whose cause we take
in hande, is aboue all nature: wherefore I will not leaue
my pretended iourney, for I doe ymagine that of thys
nyghtes trauell shall come greate ease and pleasure, saying,
that the Deuill hathe in this forme of a Bull appeared,
to disturbe vs. He hadde no sooner ended his talke,
when hys Horse fell likewise: then counsell was taken
what was best to be done.</p>

<p>It was determined that the Horses which were fallē,
should be returned to the Campe, and that of the residue,
eache Horseman should leade hys Horse by the bridle,
and so proceede on theyr way, and shortly after the Horses
were well agayne, but they neuer knewe of what
motion they hadde fallen: wyth the darkenesse of the
nyghte they lost theyr way to the Mountaynes, and
chanced into a cragged rockie waye, that they thoughte
neuer to haue come out thereof.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A famous Cortez.</div>

<p>And after a whyle that they had gone this euill waye,
wyth their heare standing with very feare, they espyed a
little lyghte, and tooke the way thyther, where they
founde a little house, wherein were two Women, and
those Women, with other two women that afterwards
they mette, conducted them to the Wildernesse, where
they had espyed the smoke, and before day they sette vpon
certayne Villages, and slewe many, yet they burned
not those Villages, bycause they should not be perceyued
through the lyght thereof. They receyued there aduyse,
that néere at hand were great populations and soone after
he came to <em class="italic">Zimpanzinco</em>, a towne of twenty thousand
houses, as after dyd appeare by the visitation of <em class="italic">Cortes</em>.
These inhabitantes béeyng vnaduised of this suddayne
happe, were taken in their beddes, and came out all naked
through the stréetes to knowe what the great mourning
and lamentation meante: at the first entrance many
were slayne, but bycause they made no resistance, <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
commaunded to ceasse from killyng, nor yet to take any
of theyr goodes, or women.</p>

<p>The feare of these poore inhabitantes was so greate,
that they fledde without respect of the father to the child,
or husbande to the Wyfe, or yet eyther of house or
goodes.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> commaunded sygnes of peace to be made vnto
them, and with that they stayed, and before the Sunne
rising, the Towne was pacifyed.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> went vp into a Tower to descry the Countrey,
and there espyed a moste greate population: he then demaunded
what it was: aunswere was made that it was
called <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, and the Townes therevnto apperteynyng.
Then he called hys Spanyardes, and sayd vnto
them: beholde, what woulde it haue preuayled vs to kyll
these poore soules, hauyng yonder so manye enimies?
and wythoute doyng anye more hurte in that Towne,
hée wente to a fayre Fountayne there at hande, and
thyther came the Rulers of that Towne, and other
foure hundred menne withoute weapon, and broughte
wyth them muche victuall, most humbly they besought
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> to doe them no more hurte, gyuing hym likewise
greate thankes, that hée hadde so fauourablye vsed
them, offering both to serue and obey hym, and from
that daye forwarde they woulde not onely kéepe hys
friendshippe, but also trauell wyth the Lordes of
<em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em> and others, that they should doe the same.
<em class="italic">Cortez</em> replyed, that sure he was, howe they had foughte
agaynste hym before that time, although that nowe
they broughte hym meate, yet notwithstandyng hée
pardoned them, and also receyued them into hys seruice
and friendshippe, to the vse of the Emperoure.</p>

<p>Wyth thys communication he departed from them,
and returned to the Campe verye ioyfull wyth so good

the suddayne fall of theyr Horses, wherein the Prouerbe
is fulfylled, whyche sayeth, Speake not euill of

<p>They hadde also a greate hope, that those newe
friendes woulde bée a meane, to cause the <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em>
to leaue from Warre, and to become theyr
friendes.</p>

<p>From that day forward he commaunded that none of

When <em class="italic">Cortez</em> was returned so ioyfull to
his Camp, he founde some of his men discouraged
with the suddayne mishappe of
the Horses, fearing that likewise some
misfortune hadde happened to <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, but
when they sawe him come well and with
victorie, their ioy was great, although true it is that manye
of his men were not well pleased, but desired muche
to leaue the warres, and to returne to the coast, as they
had often requested, but nowe chiefly séeyng such a great
Countrey, and full of people, who woulde not permitte
theyr abiding there, and they béeing so fewe in number
in the middest among them withoute hope of succoure,
certaynely things to be feared. With this murmuration
they thought it good to talke with <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, &#38; also to require
him to procéede no further, but returne backe agayne
to <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em>, from whence by little and little they
mighte haue intelligence with the <em class="italic">Indians</em>, and therevppon
procéede according to tyme, and that he mighte prouide
more Horses and men, whiche was the chiefest prouision
of the warre.</p>

<p>And although some secretely enformed <em class="italic">Cortes</em> of thys
matter, yet he gaue no eare to their talke, but on a night
as hée came out of hys Tower to ouerlooke the watche,
hée hearde a loude talke out of one of the Cotages,
and beganne to hearken what theyr communication
was: and the matter was, that certaine souldiers sayde
these wordes: If our Captayne be madde, and go where
he may be slayne, let him goe alone, what néede we to follow
him. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> hearyng this talke, called twoo of his
friendes for witnesse, willyng them to harken his souldiers
talke, for he that durst speake suche wordes would be
ready to doe it. Also he hearde others say, what shall our
iourney be as <em class="italic">Pedro Carbonerotes</em> was? who went into <em class="italic">Barbaria</em>
to take Mores, and he and all his were there slayne,
wherefore sayde they let vs not follow him but turne in

Maisters and louyng friendes, I did choose
you for my fellowes, and ye chose me for
your captaine, and all was for the seruice
of God, and the augmenting of his holy
faith, &#38; also the seruice of our soueraigne
Lord the King now Emperour: and next
for our owne commoditie, I (as yée haue séene) haue not
fayled nor yet displeased yée, nor yée likewise haue otherwise
done to me vnto this day. But now I do féele faintnesse
in some, yea and an euill will to goe forwarde in the
warres whiche we haue in hande: but (God be praysed) it
is now finished, at the least the ende is vnderstood, what it
may be, and also the wealth that may follow, as partely
you haue séene, but much without comparison of that you
haue not séene, whiche is a thing that doth excéede the
greatnesse of our wordes or thoughts.</p>

<p>Feare not my louyng fellowes to goe and abide
with me, God forbidde that I should thynke, yea or that
any shoulde reporte, that feare vexeth my company, or
else disobedience to their Captayne, whiche is a perpetuall
infamie, if wée shoulde leaue this Lande, this
Warre, this way already made, and returne as some doe
desire, shall wée then lyue at reste, loytring as idell and
loste folke: God forbidde, that euer oure nation shoulde
haue suche a name, hauyng warres of honour. And whether
(I pray) shall the Oxe goe where he shall not helpe
to ploughe the grounde? doe yée thinke peraduenture that
yée shall finde lesse people, worse armed, and not farre
from the sea? I doe assure you, that in so thynkyng yée
séeke after fiue féete for a Catte, yea and you shall trauell
no way, but that you shall méete some euill passage
(as the Prouerbe sayth) yea and farre worser than this
that we haue in hande. For why (God be thanked) since
wée came into this Countrey, we neuer wanted meate,
friendes, neyther money nor honour. For nowe yée
sée that yée are estéemed more than menne, yea as persons
immortall, and Goddes, if it mighte be spoken, for
these <em class="italic">Indians</em> beyng so many and without number, and
so armed as ye your selues affirme, yet can they not kyll
one of vs: and as touchyng theyr weapons, you sée that
they are not poysoned, as the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Cartagena</em>, <em class="italic">Veragna</em>,
and the <em class="italic">Caribez</em> doe vse, whiche haue killed many
of our nation therewith, dying as madde menne ragyng.</p>

<p>And if there were no other cause than this onely, you
shoulde not séeke others with whome to warre: I doe
confesse that the Sea is somewhat farre from vs, and
neuer Spaniarde trauelled so farre into the mayne lande
of <em class="italic">India</em>, as wée haue done: for why? nowe we leaue the
Sea a hundreth and fiftie myles behinde vs, nor yet euer
any hath come to neare <em class="italic">Mexico</em> where <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> dothe
reside, from whome suche messages and Treasure wée
haue receyued. It is nowe but thrée score myles thyther,
and the worste is paste, as you doe sée, if we come thither,
as I truste in Iesus wée shall, then shall we not
onely gette and winne for the Emperoure oure naturall
Lorde a riche Lande, greate Kingdomes, infinite
Vassalles, but lykewyse for oure selues muche riches,
as Golde, Siluer, Pretious stones, Pearles, and other
commoditie, and besides thys, the greatest honour that
euer any nation did obtayne. For loke howe great a King
this is, howe large his countrey is, and what greate
multitude of people hée hath, so muche the more is our
glory.</p>

<p>Besides all this, wée are bounde as Christians to
exalte and enlarge oure Catholyke fayth, as wée haue
begonne, abolishyng Idolatrie and blasphemie agaynst
our Sauiour Christe, takyng away the blouddy Sacrifice
and eatyng of mannes fleshe, so horrible and agaynste
nature, and many other grieuous sinnes so
muche here vsed, for the foulenesse whereof I name
them not.</p>

<p>And therefore (I saye) feare you nor yet doubte you
the victorie, consideryng that the worste is paste. Of
late wée ouercame the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Tabasco</em>, and also an
hundreth and fiftie thousande this other daye of the <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em>,
who haue the onely name of breakers of Lyons
iawes: so with Gods helpe you shal be Conquerers
of the reste, if ye faynt not and folowe me.</p>

<p>All hys company was pleased and contente with
this comfortable exhortation, and those that were faynt
harted recouered strength. And hys valiaunt Souldiers
recouered double courage, &#38; those who hated him began
to honour him: and in conclusion he departed from thence
excéeding welbeloued of all his company. But all his former
talke was very néedefull as time then requyred: for
why? some of his (as you haue heard) were desirous to returne:
likewise vpon dissention, rebellion mought haue
growen, and he forced to returne to the sea coaste, where
all his toyle and trauell taken had bene lost.</p>

captayne in <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, &#38; of all the warres:
he brought in his company fiftie persons
of auctoritie to kéepe him cōpany. They approched neare
where <em class="italic">Cortes</em> was, and saluted eche other according to the
vse of their countrey. Their salutations ended and the
parties setten downe, <em class="italic">Xicotencatl</em> began the talke, saying:
Sir I am come on mine owne behalf and also of my
fellow Captaine, and Lieuetenant <em class="italic">Maxixca</em>, and in the
name of many other noble personages, and finally in the
name of the whole state and common weale of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>,
to beséeche and pray you to admitte vs into your friendshippe,
and to yéelde our selues and countrey vnto your
King, crauyng also at your hande pardon for our attempt
in takyng armes agaynst you, wée not knowyng what
you were, nor what you sought for in our countrey. And
where we presumed to resiste and defende your entrance,
we did it as agaynst straungrrs whome we knewe not,
and suche menne as we had neuer here tofore séene: and
fearyng also that you had bene friendes to <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
who is and alwayes hath bene our mortall enimy. And
these things wée suspected, seyng <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> his seruaunts
in your company, or else we imagined that you were
comen to vsurpe our libertie, the which of tyme without
memory we haue possessed, as our forefathers did
with the shedyng of their bloud. And of our owne naturall
prouision we wante cotten woolle to clothe vs, wherfore
in tyme paste we wente as naked as we were borne,
but some of vs vsed other clothe to couer our nakednesse,
made of the leaues of the trée called <em class="italic">Metl</em>: and Salte also
wée wanted, of which twoo things so necessarie to humayne
lyfe, <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> had greate store, and other our
enimies, with whome we are rounde aboute enuironed.
And lykewise where wée haue no gold, stones of value,
or any riche thyng to barter with them, of very pure necessitie
many times we are forced to sell our owne bodies
to buy these wantes. And this extremitie (sayde he)
wée néeded not, if that we woulde be subiectes and vassalles
to <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>. But yet had we rather all in generall
to end our lyues, than wée woulde putte oure
selues in suche subiection, for we thynke our selues as
valiaunt menne in courage as our forefathers were,
who alwayes haue resisted agaynst him and his grandfather,
who was as mightie as nowe is he: wée woulde
also haue withstoode you and your force, but wée coulde
not, although we proued all our possibilitie by night and
day, and found your strength inuincible, and we no lucke
agaynst you. Therefore sithence our fate is such, we
had rather be subiect vnto you than vnto any others.
For wée haue knowen and hearde by the <em class="italic">Zeampoallanezes</em>,
that you doe no euill, nor came not to vere any, but
were moste valliaunt and happie, as they had séene in
the warres, beyng in your companie. For whiche consideration,
we truste that our libertie shall not be diminished,
but rather our owne persons, wyues, and familie
better preserued, and our houses and husbandry not
destroyed. And in sūme of all his talke, the teares trickling
downe his chéekes, he besought <em class="italic">Cortes</em> to wey that
<em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em> did neuer at any tyme reknowledge any superiour
King or Lorde, nor at any time had commen any
person among them to commaunde, but onely he, whome
they did voluntarily electe and chose as their superiour
and ruler.</p>

<p>It can not be tolde, howe muche <em class="italic">Cortes</em> reioyced with
this Embassage, and to sée such a mighty Captayne come
vnto his campe to submitte himselfe: and also it was a
matter of great wayght to haue that Cittie in subiection,
for the enterprice whiche he had in hande, whereby he fully
made an account that the warres were at an ende, to
the great cōtentation of him and his company, and with
great fame and reputation among the <em class="italic">Indians</em>.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> with a mery and louing countenaunce answered,
laying to their charge the hurte and damage whiche
he had receyued in their countrey, bycause they refused at
the firste to harken vnto him, and quietly to suffer him
to enter into their countrey, euen as he had required and
desired by his Messengers of <em class="italic">Zeampoallan</em> sente vnto them
from <em class="italic">Zaclotan</em>. Yet al this notw<sup>t</sup>standyng, he did both pardon
the kyllyng of his twoo horses, the assaultyng of him
in the highe way, and the greate lies whiche they had
moste craftily vsed with hym, (for where as they themselues
fought agaynst him, yet they layde the faulte to others)
likewise their pretence to murder him in the ambush
prepared for him, (enticing him to come to their Citie,)
without makyng firste defiance according to the law
of armes.</p>

<p>These causes notwithstanding, he did louingly receyue
their offer made in subiection to the Emperour, and in
this sorte departed, saying, that shortely hée woulde be
with him in <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, and presently he coulde not goe

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> answered, that although their aduise were true,

lesse in the towne than in the fielde. They hearyng this

who were so poore y<sup>t</sup> with necessitie they would

greate heape of stones, and entred into <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em> the
eightenth of September. There came out such a multitude
of people to sée him and to méete him in the way, that
it was a wonder to sée.</p>

<p>He was lodged in the greatest temple, which had many
great and fayre lodgyngs, sufficient for hym and all
his companie, except the <em class="italic">Indians</em> hys friends which were
lodged in other Temples. He set certayne limittes, out
of the whiche he commaunded straightely that none of
hys company should passe, vpon payne of deathe, and also
commaunded that they shoulde take nothing, but what
shoulde be giuen them. His commaundement was well
obserued, for none presumed to goe a stoanes cast without
his licence. The <em class="italic">Indian</em> Gentlemen shewed greate
pleasure and curtesie to the strangers, and prouided thē
of all things necessarie, and manye of them gaue theyr
daughters vnto them, in token of true friendshippe, and
likewise to haue fruite of their bodyes, to be brought vp
for the warres, beyng such valiant men.</p>

<p>This Countrey lyked well oure men, and the greate
loue of the people. They abode there at their pleasure
twenty dayes, in whiche time they did procure to knowe
particularly the estate of their common weale and secretes,
and also were sufficiently instructed of the estate
of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>.</p>

<em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em> is properly in the <em class="italic">Indian</em> tong
as much to say, as bread well baked, for
there is more grayne called <em class="italic">Centli</em> gathered,
than is in all y<sup>e</sup> prouince round about.</p>

<p>In times past the Citie was called <em class="italic">Texcallan</em>,
that is to say, a valley betwixt two
hilles. It is a greate Citie, and planted by a riuer side,
whiche springeth out of <em class="italic">Atlancatepec</em>, and watreth the
most parte of that prouince, and from thence issueth out
into the South sea, by <em class="italic">Zacatullan</em>. This Citie hathe foure
goodly stréetes, whiche are called <em class="italic">Tepeticpac</em>, <em class="italic">Ocotelulco</em>, <em class="italic">Tizatlan</em>,
<em class="italic">Quiahuiztlan</em>. The firste stréete standeth on hygh
vpon a hyll, farre from the riuer, whiche maye be aboute
halfe a league, and bycause it standeth on a hill, it is called
<em class="italic">Tepeticpac</em>, that is to say, a hyll, and was the firste population
which was foūded there on high, bycause of the
warres.</p>

<p>An other stréete was scituate on the hill side towarde
the Riuer, bycause at the building thereof, there were
many pyne trées: they named it <em class="italic">Ocotelulco</em>, which is to say,
a pine apple plot. This stréete was beautifull, and firste
inhabited of all the Citie, and there was the chiefest
Market place, where all the buying and selling was vsed,
and that place they called <em class="italic">Tianquiztli</em>: in that stréete
was the dwelling house of <em class="italic">Maxixca</em>. Along the Riuer
side in the playne standeth another stréete called <em class="italic">Tizatlan</em>,
bycause there is muche lyme and chalke. In this stréete
dwelled <em class="italic">Xicotencatl</em>, Captayne generall of the common
weale. There is another stréete named by reason of the
brackish water, <em class="italic">Quiahuiztlan</em>, but since the Spanyardes
came thither, all those buildings are almost altered, after
a better fashion, and built with stone. In the plaine
by the riuer side, standeth the Towne house, and other
offices, as in the Citie of <em class="italic">Venice</em>. This <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em> was gouerned
by noble and riche men: they vse not that one alone
should rule, but rather flye from that order, as from
tyrannie.</p>

<p>In their warres (as I haue sayde before) they haue
foure Captaynes, whiche gouerneth eache one stréete, of
the whiche foure, they do elect a Captayne generall. Also
there are other Gentlemen that are vndercaptaynes, but
a small number. In the warres they vse their standerde
to be carried behynde the army, but when the battayle is
to be fought, they place the standerde where all the hoste
may sée it, and he that commeth not incontinent to hys
auntient, payeth a penaltie. Their standerd hathe two
crossebowe arrowes set thereon, whiche they estéeme as
the relikes of their auncetors. Thys standerd two olde
souldiers and valiant menne, being of the chiefest Captaynes,
haue the charge to carrie, in the which standerde
an abusion of southsaying, eyther of losse or victory is noted.
In this order they shote one of these arrowes against
the first enimies that they méete, and if with that arrow
they doe eyther kill or hurte, it is a token that they shall
haue the victorie, and if it neyther kill nor hurt, then they
assuredly beléeue that they shall lose the field.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A strange contractation.</div>

<p>This prouince or Lordship of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, hath .28. Villages
and townes, wherein is conteyned 150000. householdes.
They are men well made, and good warriors, the
lyke are not among the <em class="italic">Indians</em>. They are very poore, and
haue no other riches, but only the grayne or corne called
<em class="italic">Centli</em>, and with the gayne and profite thereof, they doe
both cloth themselues, and paye their tributes, and prouide
all other necessaries. They haue many market places,
but the greatest and most vsed dayly, standeth in the
stréete of <em class="italic">Ocotelulco</em>, whiche is so famous, that 30000. persons
come thither in one day to buy and sell, whyche
is to say, changing one thing for another, for they know
not what money meaneth.</p>

<p>They sell such things in that market, as héere we vse,
&#38; al thing vnto them néedeful to eate, and cloth for themselues,
and necessaries for building.</p>

<p>They haue all kinde of good policie in the Citie: there
are Goldsmithes, fetherdressers, Barbors, hotehouses,
and potters, who make as good earthen vessel, as is made
in <em class="italic">Spayne</em>. The earth is fat and fruitefull for corne, fruite,
and pasture, for among the pine trées groweth so muche
grasse, that our men féede their cattell there, whiche in
<em class="italic">Spayne</em> they can not do.</p>

<p>Within two leagues of that Citie standeth a rounde
hill of sixe miles of heigth, and fiue and fortie myles in
compasse, and is now called Saint Bartholmewes hill,
where the snow fréeseth. In times past they called that
hill <em class="italic">Matealcucie</em>, who was their God for water. They
had also a God for wyne, who was named <em class="italic">Ometochtli</em>, for
the great dronkennesse whiche they vsed. They chiefest
God was called <em class="italic">Camaxtlo</em>, and by another name <em class="italic">Mixcouatl</em>,
whose Temple stoode in the stréete of <em class="italic">Ocotelulco</em>, in
the whiche temple there was sacrifised some yeares aboue
eyghte hundred persons. In <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em> they spake
thrée languages, that is to saye, <em class="italic">Nahualh</em>, whiche is the
courtly spéech, and chiefest in all the land of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>: an other
is called <em class="italic">Otomir</em>, which is most commonly vsed in the
Villages: There is one onely stréete that spake <em class="italic">Pinomer</em>,
which is the grosest speache. There was also in that Citie
a common Iayle, where fellons lye in yrons, and all
things which they held for sinne, was there corrected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Correctiō.</div>

<p>It chanced at that time a Townesman to steale from
a Spanyard a little golde, whereof <em class="italic">Cortes</em> complayned to
<em class="italic">Maxixca</em>, who incōtinent made such enquirie, y<sup>t</sup> the offender
was found in <em class="italic">Chololla</em>, whiche is another Citie fyue
leagues from thence: they brought the prisoner with the
golde, and deliuered him to <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, to doe with him hys
pleasure: <em class="italic">Cortes</em> woulde not accepte him, but gaue hym
thankes for his diligence: then was he carried wyth a
Cryer before hym, manifestyng hys offence, and in the
Market place vppon a skaffolde they brake hys ioyntes
with a cudgell: our men maruelled to sée suche straunge

When <em class="italic">Cortez</em> saw that these people executed
Iustice, and liued in Religion after theyr
manner, although abhominable and diuelish:
and alwayes when he desired them to
leaue off from their Idolatrie and that
cruell vanitie, in killing and eating men
sacrifised, considering that none among them how holly
soeuer he were, would willingly be slayne &#38; eaten, required
them to beléeue in the most true God of the Chrystians,
who was the maker of Heauen and earth, the giuer
of rayne, and creator of all things that the earthe produceth
only for the vse and profite of mortall man.</p>

<p>Some of them aunswered, that they woulde gladly do
it, onely to pleasure him, but they feared that the commons
would arise and stone them. Others sayde, that it
was an hard matter to vnbeléeue that which their forefathers
had so long beléeued, and that it shoulde be a cause
to condemne their forefathers and themselues.</p>

<p>Others sayde, that it mighte be in time they woulde
conuert, séeing the order of the Christian Religion, and
vnderstanding the reasons and causes to turne Christians,
and likewise perceyuing thoroughly the manner
and life of the Christiās, with their lawes and customs:
and as for warlike feates, they were satisfyed, &#38; had séene

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> promised them, that shortlye he woulde bring

then they should sée which way was best, with the greate
ioy and fruite that they shoulde féele. They accepting
that councell which he like a friende had giuen them, and
for as much as presently it could not be brought to passe

<p>He desired them, that the Temple wherein he was

<p>The <em class="italic">Indians</em> graunted to his request, and dayly came

<em class="italic">Cortez</em> being throughly satisfyed of theyr
hartie good wylles, he demaunded of them
the estate and riches of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>.
They exalted him greately, as men that
had proued his force. And as they affyrmed,
it was néere a hundred yeares that they mainteyned
warre with him and his father <em class="italic">Axaiaca</em>, and others
his Vnckles and Grandfathers. And saide also, that the
golde and treasure of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, was without number,
and his power and dominion ouer all the lande, and hys
people innumerable: for (quoth they) he ioyneth sometime
two hundreth thousand men, yea and thrée hundred thousande
for one battayle. And if it pleased hym, he woulde
make as manye men double, and thereof they were good
witnesse, bycause they had manye times fought with thē.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Maxixca</em> desired that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> should not aduenture themselues
into the power of the men of <em class="italic">Culhua</em>, whereat some
of the <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em> feared and suspected euill of the matter.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> tolde him, that notwithstanding all those things
whiche they had tolde him, he was fully minded to goe to
<em class="italic">Mexico</em>, to visit <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, wishing him to aduise hym
what he mought do, or bring to passe for them with <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
for he woulde willingly do it, for the curtesie shewed
vnto him, and that he beléeued <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> woulde
graunt him any lawfull request.</p>

<p>Then they besought him to procure for them a licence
to haue cotten wooll and salte out of his Countrey, for
(sayd they) in time of the warres we stoode in greate néede
thereof, and that they had none but suche as they boughte
by stealthe of the Comercans verye déere, in change of
golde: for <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> had made a straight lawe, whereby
all suche as carried anye of those commodities to them
shoulde be slayne. Then <em class="italic">Cortez</em> enquired the cause of their
disorder and euill neyborhood. They aunswered, that
their griefes were olde, and cause of libertie: but as the
Ambassadors did affyrme, and <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> afterward declare,
it was not so, but for other matter farre differente.
So that eache partye alleadging their causes, theyr reasons
were, that the yong menne of <em class="italic">Mexico</em> and <em class="italic">Culhua</em>
dyd exercise and bryng them vppe in warlike feates
néere vnto them, and vnder theyr noses, to theyr
greate annoyance, whereas they moughte haue
gone to <em class="italic">Panuco</em> and <em class="italic">Teocantepec</em>, hys frontiers a farre
off.</p>

<p>Lykewyse theyr pretence was, to haue warre wyth
them béeyng theyr neyghbors, onely to haue of them
to sacrifice to their Gods: so that when they would make
any solemne feast, then would they send to <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em> for
men to sacrifice, with such a great army, that they might
take as many as they néeded for that yeare: for it is most
certayne if <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> woulde, in one daye hée moughte
haue broughte them in subiection, and slayne them
all, ioyning his whole power in effecte: but his purpose
was, to kéepe them for a pray to hunt withall, for men
to be sacrificed to his Goddes, and to eate, so that hée
woulde neuer sende but a small armye againste them:
whereby it did chance that sometimes those of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>
did ouercome.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> receyued great pleasure to heare these discordes
betwixt his newe friendes and <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, whiche was
a thing fitte for his purpose, for by that meanes he hoped
to bring them all vnder subiection, and therefore hée
vsed the one and the other secretely, to build his pretence
vpon a good foundation.</p>

<p>At all this communication there stoode by certayne
<em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Vexozinco</em>, whiche had bin against our men in
the late warres, the which Towne is a Citie as <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>,
and ioyned with them in league of friendship against
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, who oppressed them in like effect of slaughter

and that there he might at his pleasure abide the resolution
of their Lord <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, whether it were his pleasure
that he should enter into <em class="italic">Mexico</em> or no. This request
was onely to haue him from thence, for truly it gréeued
much <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> of theyr new friendshippe and league,
fearyng that thereof woulde some great displeasure happen
towardes him, and therefore procured all that was
possible to haue him from thence, sending him alwayes
presents to allure him to come frō thence the sooner. But
when the <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em> saw that he would goe to <em class="italic">Chololla</em>, it
grieued them muche, saying vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>

<div class="sidenote">Correction

<p>The women that were giuen to the Spaniardes at
their firste entraunce, had vnderstandyng of a snare that
was layde to murder them at their commyng to <em class="italic">Chololla</em>,
by meanes of one of the foure Captaynes, who had a sister
which discouered the thing to <em class="italic">Pedro de Aluarado</em> who
kepte hir. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> incontinent called that Captayne out
of his house, and caused him to be choked, and so was the
matter kepte close that his death was neuer knowen,
whereby the snare was vndone without any rumour. It
was a wonder that all <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em> had not made an vprore
seyng one of their greatest Captaynes dead. There was
inquirie made of that snare, and the truth being knowen,
it was approued that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> had prepared .30000.
Souldiers who were in campe for that purpose within
twoo leagues of the Citie, and that the streates in <em class="italic">Chololla</em>
were stopped vp with timber and rayles, and the toppes
of their houses prouided with stones, which houses are
made with playne rooffes or sotties, and the highe way
stopped vp, &#38; other false bywayes made with déepe holes
pitched ful of stakes very sharpe, to spoyle and lame both
horse and man: these engines were finely couered with
sande, and coulde not be espied, although the skoute had
gone before on foote to discouer. The matter also was very
suspitious, for these Citizens of <em class="italic">Chololla</em> had not at any
time come to visite hym, or sente any presente vnto him
as others had done.</p>

<p>Wherevpon <em class="italic">Cortez</em> consulted with the <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em> to
sende certayne messengers to <em class="italic">Chololla</em>, to request their Captaynes
and rulers to come vnto him, who did their message
accordingly, and the <em class="italic">Cholollans</em> woulde not come, but
yet they sent thrée or foure persons to excuse them, saying
that they were not well at ease, praying to signifie vnto
them what he woulde haue: the <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em> enformed <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
that those messengers were menne of small credite and
of lowe degrée, wishyng hym not to departe till theyr
Captayne came. In this sorte <em class="italic">Cortes</em> returned theyr messengers
backe agayne, with commaundement written,
declaring that if they came not within thrée dayes, hée
woulde proclayme them rebelles and his vtter enimies,
and as suche would he chasten with all rigour.</p>

<p>When this commaundement came vnto them, the next
day followyng came many Lordes and Captaynes to
make their excuse, saying, that the <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em> were their
enimies, and that through them they could not liue in
safetie, lykewise they knewe of the euill reporte whiche
they had made agaynst them: wherefore they besought
him to giue no credite vnto them, for why, they were both
false and cruell menne: beséechyng him also to goe with
them to their Citie, and then he should sée that all was
but a mockery that had bene tolde him, and they his good
and faythfull friends: and laste of all they offered to serue
him as tributary subiectes.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> commaunded that all this talke should be sette
downe in wryting before the Notary and his interpreters,
and so tooke his leaue of the Citizens of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>.
<em class="italic">Maxixca</em> wepte at his departure, but there wente in his
company a hundreth thousande men of warre: there were among
them many Marchantes that wente to barter for
Salte and Mantels.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> commaunded that those hundreth thousande
men should go alwayes by thēselues: that day he reached
not to <em class="italic">Chololla</em>, but abode by a broke side, and thither came
many of the citie, to desire him that the <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em> should
not doe any hurte in their countrey: wherevpon <em class="italic">Cortes</em> cōmaunded
them to returne backe againe all sauing .5000.
or there aboute, much against their willes. But they stil
required him to take good héede of those euill folke, who
be not (quoth they) men of warre, but pedlers, and men of
double harte: and they of their partes would be very loth
to leaue him in any peril or daunger, hauing giuen themselues
to be his true and faithfull friendes.</p>

<p>The nexte day in the morning the Spaniardes came
to <em class="italic">Chololla</em>, and there came out néere .10000. <em class="italic">Indians</em> to receyue
him with their Captaynes in good order: many of
them presented vnto him bread, foule, &#38; roses, and euery
Captayne as he approched welcomed <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, and then
stoode aside that the reste in order mighte come vnto him.
And when he came entring into the Citie, all the other
Citizēs receyued him, marueling to sée such men &#38; horses.</p>

<p>After all this came out all the religious menne, as
Priests, and Ministers to the idols (who were many and
straunge to beholde,) and all were clothed in white lyke
vnto surplices and hemmed with Cotten thréede: some
brought instrumentes of musicke like vnto Cornettes,
other brought instrumēts made of bones, other an instrumēt
like a ketel couered with skin, some brought chafing
dishes of coales with perfumes, others brought idols couered,
and finally they al came singing in their language,
which was a terrible noyse, and drew néere <em class="italic">Cortes</em> and his
cōpany, sensing them with swéete smelles in their sensers.</p>

<p>With this pompe and solemnitie (whiche truely was
great) they brought him into the Cittie, and lodged him in
a house where was roume inough for him and his, and
gaue vnto eche of them a Gynnea cocke, and his <em class="italic">Indians</em>

straungers: and seyng that all these pollicies auayled not,
they consulted with the Captaynes and chiefe Citizens to
murder the Christians. And bycause they shoulde so
bryng it to passe, the Embassadours promysed the Citizens
greate rewardes on the behalfe of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, and
presented to theyr generall a drumme of Golde, and promised
to bryng the thirtie thousande souldiers whiche lay
aboute twoo leagues from thence: the <em class="italic">Cholollans</em> promysed
to deliuer them bounde hande and foote. But yet they
woulde not consente that those Soldiers of <em class="italic">Culhua</em> should
come into their Cittie, fearyng that they (vnder colour
of friendshippe) woulde remayne with the towne, for
why, the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> had vsed the lyke sleyght. And in this
sorte they with one bolte meante to kill twoo byrdes at a
shote, for they thought to take the Spaniardes sléepyng,
and then to remayne with the Towne of <em class="italic">Cholalla</em>. Also it
was determined, that if all these pretences coulde not be
brought to passe, that then they should be conducted a contrary
way to <em class="italic">Mexico</em> vpon the left hande, in the whiche
were many daungerous places, bycause the way was all
sandy, with many sluces, diches, and holes of thrée fadome
déepe, meanyng there to méete them and to carry them
bounde to <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>: this matter being fully agreed, they
beganne to take away theyr householde stuffe, and to carry
it with their wiues and chyldren vp into the mountaynes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Helpe from God.</div>

<p>And our men beyng also ready to departe from thence
for theyr small chéere with euill countenaunce, it happened,
an <em class="italic">Indian</em> woman (beyng wife to one of the principalest
Cittizens,) hauing some affection to the bearded men,
sayde vnto <em class="italic">Marina</em>, that shée shoulde abide there with hyr,
for that she loued hir well, and that it woulde grieue hir
that she should be slayne with hir mayster. <em class="italic">Marina</em> dissimulyng
the matter, procured to knowe what they were
that had conspired the thing, and hauing knowledge therof,
she ranne to séeke <em class="italic">Aguillar</em> hir fellow interpreter, and
both togither enformed <em class="italic">Cortes</em> of the whole matter.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> hearyng this newes, slepte not, but incontinent
examined twoo of the Citizens, who confessed the thyng
euen as it passed, and as the Gentlewoman had declared:
wherevpon <em class="italic">Cortes</em> stayed his iourney twoo dayes, to mollifie
the matter and to disapoynt them of that euill pretended
purpose, and also to correcte their offences, he commaunded
their rulers to be called, saying that he had to
talke with them, and when they were comen he requyred
them neyther to vse lies nor deceytes with hym, but
rather lyke menne to defie him to the fielde and battayle,
for (quoth hée) honest menne vse rather to fighte than
to lie. They all answered that they were his friendes and
seruitours, and no liars, and that it mighte please him
to shewe them when he woulde departe, for they woulde
goe armed to kéepe hym company. He answered that he
woulde departe the nexte day followyng, and that he required
but onely some of their slaues to carry his fardage,
bycause his owne <em class="italic">Tamemez</em> or Carriars were weried:
lykewise he requyred some prouision of victuall.</p>

<p>At this laste requeste they smyled, saying among
themselues, to what purpose will these men haue victuals,
for shortly they themselues shalbe boyled and eaten
with the sause called <em class="italic">Axi</em>, yea, and if <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> had not

The nexte day in the mornyng the <em class="italic">Cholollans</em>
thinkyng that they had their determinate
purpose in good readinesse, they
came and brought many to carry their
fardage, &#38; other some to carry the Spaniardes
vppon their backes, hopyng to
apprehēd them in the same order. There came also many
armed men of the most valiantest, to kill him that should
disorder himselfe. Likewise that day their Priests sacrificed
ten children of thrée yeares of age to their God <em class="italic">Quezalcouatl</em>,
fiue of these children were menne, and the other
fiue wemen, whiche was their custome when they
began their warres: the Captaynes placed themselues at
the foure dores of <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his house with some armed men.
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> earely in the mornyng had secretely in a readinesse
the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em> and <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, and other
friends: he cōmaunded his horsemen to take their horses,
giuing them this watche worde, that when they hearde
the noyse of the shotte of a handgun, that then they should
play the mē, for it imported all their liues. And he seing
the townes men approch néere his lodging, commaunded
y<sup>e</sup> captaynes &#38; chiefest of them to come vnto him, saying,
y<sup>t</sup> he would take his leaue of them: there came many, but
he would not suffer aboue thirtie persons to come in, who
were the principallest, and declared vnto thē, that alwaies
he had dealte truly with them, &#38; they with him nothing
but treason and lies. Likewise they had vnder colour requested
that his friēds the <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em> shuld not come vnto
their towne, &#38; that he fulfilled therein their desire, &#38; also
cōmaunded his own men in no wise to be hurtful vnto
thē, yea &#38; although they had not prouided him of victuals
as reason did require, yet he would not permit any of his
men to take the value of one henne from them, so that in
recompence of all his gentle dealings and good will, they
had moste wickedly procured the death of him and all his
companie. And bycause they coulde not performe it in
their owne towne, they had prepared the slaughter in the
high way, at those daungerous places whiche they had
determined to leade them vnto, pretendyng also the helpe
of thirtie thousand men, Souldiers of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, whiche
army stoode not fully two leagues from thence. And for
this horrible and detestable wickednesse yée shall all die,
and in memory of traytors I will destroy this cittie, and
turne the fundations vpwardes, so that there shall remayne
no remembraunce of you.</p>

<p>Their offence beyng manifest, coulde not be denied,
and lookyng one vpon an other, their colours waxed pale
and wanne, saying, this man is lyke vnto our Goddes,
who knoweth all things, therefore lette vs not denie the
truth, and openly before the Embassadours of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
confesse their errour and euill facte.</p>

<p>Then sayd <em class="italic">Cortes</em> to the Embassadours, you do sée that
we should haue bene slaine by the <em class="italic">Cholollans</em>, and through
the procurement of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, but yet I beleue it not, cōsideryng
that he is my friende and a mightie Prince, saying
also that Noble men vsed neyther treason nor lyes,
wherefore feare not you, but these dissemblyng Traytors
shall be punished, for you are persons inuiolable and messengers
of a Prince, whome he meante to serue and not
offende, bicause he had an assured opinion in <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
to be a vertuous Prince, and one that woulde not committe
villanie.</p>

<p>All these wordes he spake, bycause he woulde not fall
out with <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, vntill he sawe himselfe within the
Cittie of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>.</p>

<p>Incontinent he commaunded some of those Captaines
to be slayne, and kepte the residue bounde. Then he shotte
off hys handgun, whiche was the watch vnto his armye,
who forthwith sette vppon the Townesmen, and within
two houres slewe sixe thousand persons and more.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> commaunded that they shoulde kill neyther woman
nor childe: they foughte welnéere fyue houres: they
sette fire on all the houses and Towers that made resistance,
and draue all the inhabitantes out of the Towne.
The dead carcases lay so thicke, that of force they must
treade vpon them.</p>

<p>There were twentie Gentlemen, and many Priestes,
who ascended vp to the high tower of the temple, whiche
hathe a hundred and twenty steppes, from whence wyth
arrowes and stones they did much hurt, and woulde not
yéelde, wherevpon oure men set fier to the Tower, and
burned them all. Then they exclaymed on their Goddes,
who woulde neyther helpe them nor their Citie and holy
sanctuary.</p>

<p>The Citie being sacked, oure men tooke the spoyle of
golde, plate, and feathers, and the <em class="italic">Indians</em> their friendes
tooke clothes and salte, which was the treasure that they
desired.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> commaunded to ceasse the spoyle. The other
Captaynes that lay bounde, hearing of suche a greate destruction
and punishment, most pitifully besought <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
to loase some of them, for to sée what was become of
their Gods and cōmō people. Likewise they humbly besought
him to pardon them, who had not so muche faulte
as <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, who perswaded and entised them to that
pretended treason.</p>

<p>Vpon their lamentable request, he loased two of them,
and the next day following the Citie was as ful of people
agayne, that there séemed not one to be wanting.</p>

<p>At the sute of the <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em> who were put for mediators,
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> pardoned them all, and sette his prisoners at
libertie, assuring them that the like correction he woulde
do vppon al them that should dissemble or shewe an euil
countenance, or make lyes, or fynally vse anye kinde of
treason toward him: wherevpon they all abode in greate
feare. He made the knot of friendship betwéene them and
the <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em>, which in time past had bin betwixt them,
for <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> and his auncetors made them enimies,
with fayre promises, words and also feare.</p>

<em class="italic">Chololla</em> is a city as <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>,
and hathe but one person
who is gouernour and
general Captayne, chosen
by the consente of all the
Citizens. It is a Citie of
twentie thousande householdes
within the walles,
and in the suburbes as
muche more. It sheweth
outwardes verye beautifull,
and full of towers, for there are as manye temples
as dayes in y<sup>e</sup> yeare, &#38; euery temple hath his tower. Our
men counted foure hundred towers. The men and womē
are of good disposition well fauoured, and very wittie.</p>

<p>The women are Goldsmithes and also Caruers, the
men are warriers, and light fellowes, and good maisters
for any purpose: they goe better apparelled than anye
other <em class="italic">Indiās</em> yet séene. They weare for their vtter garmēt
clokes like vnto Moriscos, but after an other sort. Al the
Countrey rounde aboute them is fruitefull and eareable
grounde, well watered, and so full of people, that there is
no wast grounde, in respect whereof, there are some poore,
whiche begge from dore to dore. The <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em> hadde
not seene any beggers in that Coūtrey before they came
thither.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Chololla</em> is a Citie of most deuotion and Religion in all
<em class="italic">India</em>, it is called y<sup>e</sup> Sanctuary or holy place among y<sup>e</sup> <em class="italic">Indians</em>,
and thither they trauelled from many places farre
distante on pilgrimage, and for this cause there were so
many temples.</p>

<p>Their Cathedrall Temple was the best and hyghest
of all the new <em class="italic">Spayne</em>, with a hundred and twenty steppes
vppe vnto it.</p>

<p>The greatest Idoll of all their Gods was called <em class="italic">Quezalcouately</em>,
God of the ayre, who was (say they) the founder
of their Citie, being a Virgin of holy lyfe, and great
penance. He instituted fasting and drawing of bloud out
of their eares and tongs, and lefte a precepte, that they
shoulde sacrifice but onely Quayles, Doues, and other foule.</p>

<p>He neuer ware but one garmente of Cotten, whyche
was white, narrow, and long, and vpon that a mantle besette
with certayne redde crosses.</p>

<p>They haue certayne gréene stones whiche were hys,
and those they kéepe for relikes. One of them is lyke
an Apes head. Héere they abode twentye dayes, and in
thys meane whyle there came so manye to buy and sell,
that it was a wonder to sée. And one of the things that
was to bée séene in those fayres, was the earthen vessell,
which was excéeding curious and fine.</p>

There is a hill eyght leagues from <em class="italic">Chololla</em>,
called <em class="italic">Popocatepec</em>, whiche is to say, a hill of
smoke, for manye tymes it casteth oute
smoke and fier. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> sente thither tenne
<em class="italic">Spanyardes</em>, with manye <em class="italic">Indians</em>, to carrie
their victuall, and to guide them in the
way. The ascending vp was very troublesome, and full
of craggie rockes. They approched so nigh the toppe,
that they heard such a terrible noyse which procéeded frō
thence, that they durst not goe vnto it, for the ground dyd
tremble and shake, and great quantitie of Ashes whyche
disturbed the way: but yet two of them who séemed to be
most hardie, and desirous to sée straunge things, went vp
to the toppe, because they would not returne with a sleuelesse
aunswere, and that they myghte not be accompted
cowardes, leauing their fellowes behinde them, procéeded
forwards. The <em class="italic">Indians</em> sayd, what meane these men:
for as yet neuer mortall man tooke suche a iourney in
hande.</p>

<p>These two valiāt fellowes passed through y<sup>e</sup> desert of
Ashes, and at length came vnder a greate smoke verye
thicke, and standing there a while, the darkenesse vanished
partly away, and then appeared the vulcan and concauetie,
which was about halfe a league in compasse, out
of the whiche the ayre came rebounding, with a greate
noyse, very shrill, and whistling, in sort that the whole hil
did tremble. It was to be compared vnto an ouen where
glasse is made. The smoke and heate was so greate, that
they coulde not abide it, and of force were constreyned to
returne by the way that they had ascended: but they wer
not gone farre, whē the vulcan began to lash out flames
of fier, ashes, and imbers, yea and at the last stones of
burning fire: and if they had not chanced to finde a rocke,
where vnder they shadowed themselues, vndoubtedlye
they had there bin burned.</p>

<p>When with good tokens they were returned where
they left their fellowes, the other <em class="italic">Indians</em> kissed their garments
as an honor due vnto Gods. They presented vnto
them such things as they had, and wondred much at their
facte.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Purgatory.</div>

<p>Those simple <em class="italic">Indians</em> thoughte, that that place was an
infernall place, where all suche as gouerned not well, or
vsed tyrannie in their offices, were punished when they
dyed, and also beléeued, that after their purgation, they
passed into glory.</p>

<p>This vulcan is like vnto the vulcan of <em class="italic">Cicilia</em>, it is
high and round, and neuer wanteth Snowe about it, and
is séene a farre off in the nighte, it lasheth out flames of
fire.</p>

<p>There is néere aboute this hyl many Cities, and <em class="italic">Huexozinco</em>
is one of the nighest.</p>

<p>In tenne yeares space this straunge hill of workyng
did expell no vapoure or smoke: but in the yeare .1540. it
beganne agayne to burne, and with the horrible noyse
thereof, the neyghbours that dwelte foure leagues from
thence were terrifyed, for the especiall straunge smokes
that then were séene, the like to their predecessors hadde
not bin séene.</p>

<p>The ashes that procéeded from thence came to <em class="italic">Huexozinco</em>,
<em class="italic">Quelaxcopan</em>, <em class="italic">Tepiacac</em>, <em class="italic">Quauhquecholla</em>, <em class="italic">Chololla</em>, and
<em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, whiche standeth tenne leagues from thence,
yea some say, it extended fiftéene leagues distant, and burned
their hearbes in their gardens, their fieldes of corne,
trées, and clothes that lay a drying.</p>

<em class="italic">Cortez</em> pretended not to fall out with <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
before his comming to <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,
and yet he vnderstoode all <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> hys
pretence, wherevppon he complayneth to
the Ambassadors, saying that he muche
maruelled that suche a mightie Prince, who by so manye
Gentlemen had assured his friendship vnto him, shoulde
nowe procure his totall destruction, in not kéeping hys
promise and fidelitie. In consideration whereof, where
he meant to visit him as a friend, that now he would goe
to his Courte as an enimie. The Ambassadors excused
their maisters cause, besieching him to withdrawe hys
furie, and to giue licence to one of them to goe to <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,
who woulde bryng aunswere from thence with all
spéede.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> graunted vnto the request, the one of them went,
and returned agayne within sixe dayes in company of another
messenger that hadde gone thither before, who
broughte tenne platters of golde, and a thousande fiue
hundred mantels of cotten, with much victuall, and <em class="italic">Cacao</em>
whiche is a kinde of fruite that serueth for currant money
among them. Likewise they brought a certaine kind
of wine or licoure made of <em class="italic">Cacao</em> and <em class="italic">Centli</em>. They enformed
<em class="italic">Cortes</em>, that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> was innocente of the coniuration
in <em class="italic">Chololla</em>, nor by anye meanes priuie to their
dealings, affyrming moreouer that the garrison of souldyers
did apperteine to <em class="italic">Acazinco</em>, and <em class="italic">Acazan</em>, who were
neyghbors to <em class="italic">Chololla</em>, who by inducement of some naughtye
persons, had procured that thing, saying that he shuld
both sée and vnderstand him to be his faithful and louing
friend, praying him to come forwarde on his iourney, for
he would abide his comming in <em class="italic">Mexico</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prophecie of the Diuell.</div>

<p>This ambassage pleased well <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, but <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
feared, when he hearde of the slaughter, and burning of
<em class="italic">Chololla</em>, and sayde to his friends, these are the people that
our Gods said should come and inherite this land.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> went incontinent to his Oratorie, and shut
in himselfe alone, where he abode in fasting and prayer
eyght dayes, with sacrifice of many menne, to asllake the
fury of his Idolles, who séemed to be offended.</p>

<p>The voyce of the Diuell spake vnto him, bidding him
not to feare the Christians, saying they were but fewe,
and when they were come, he should doe what he lysted
with them, willing him in no wise to ceasse from the
bloudy sacrifice, least some mischance might happen vnto
him. And assured hym that he should haue the Goddes
<em class="italic">Vitzipuchtli</em>, and <em class="italic">Tescatlipuca</em> to preserue and kéepe hym.
And bycause <em class="italic">Quezalcouatle</em> was agréeued for wante of
bloudy sacrifice, he permitted the Straungers to punishe
them of <em class="italic">Chololla</em>. And <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> hearing this dyuelishe
Oracle, and likewise <em class="italic">Cortez</em> hauing warned him that hée
would visite hym as an enimie, he was by this perswasion
of Sathan, the better willing to receyue hym into
<em class="italic">Mexico</em>.</p>

<p>Likewise <em class="italic">Cortes</em> when he came to <em class="italic">Chololla</em>, was strong,
and hadde at commaundemente a mightie power, and
there made hymselfe stronger, the fame whereof, was
blowen abroade, throughout all the dominions of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>.
And whereas the poore <em class="italic">Indians</em> hadde but onely
maruelled at their persons and furniture, nowe they began
to tremble and to feare at his doings, so that wheresoeuer
he came, they opened him the gates with pure
feare, more than for any loue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An euill counsellor.</div>

<p><em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> at the beginning, pretended to feare <em class="italic">Cortes</em>

as the fortitude of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, with his greate multitude of
subiectes, and the great number of Princes that dyd both
serue and obey him: and séeyng that all these things profited
not, he thoughte to haue ouercome him with gyftes

he sawe that nothing woulde preuayle, for that <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
woulde néedes come to sée hym, wherevppon, he tooke
counsell of the Diuell what he shoulde doe in that case,
vpon which counsell he was satisfyed by hys Priests and
Captaynes, that he ought not to warre against so fewe
straungers, for if he so did, the dishonor would be his, and
chiefly, bycause <em class="italic">Cortez</em> certifyed that he was an Ambassador,
and vsing hym otherwise, it myghte so fall out,
that hys owne subiectes would rebell againste him theyr
Lorde and Prince, saying likewise that it was manifest
that the <em class="italic">Otomies</em> and <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em> woulde fauour his syde,
and also manye others, for to destroy and spoyle <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,
vpon which consultation it was openly proclaymed, that

from <em class="italic">Chololla</em> with some borderers that would néedes

<div class="sidenote">Oh vvise Cortes.</div>

<p>He lefte the way that the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> had perswaded him
to come, for it was bothe euill and daungerous, as the
Spaniarde whiche went to the vulcan had séene, he went
another playner way and more nearer. That day he traueled
but foure leagues, bicause he meant to lodge in the
villages of <em class="italic">Huexozinco</em>, where he was friendly receyued,
and they presented vnto him slaues, garments, and golde,
although but little, for they are poore by reason that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
hath enuironed them aboute, bicause they were of
the parcialitie of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>. The next day in the morning
he ascended vp a hill couered with snowe, which was sixe
myles of heigth, where if the .30000. Souldiers had wayted
for them, they might easily haue taken them, by reason
of the great colde: and from the toppe of that hill, they discouered
y<sup>e</sup> land of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and the great lake with his villages
rounde about, whiche is an excéedyng goodly sight.
But when <em class="italic">Cortes</em> saw that beautifull thing, his ioy was
without comparison, and he tooke not so much pleasure,
but some of his men feared as muche, and there was a
murmuration among them to returne backe againe, yea

with his wisedome and dissimulation did pacifie the matter,
with courage, hope, and gentle wordes, and they seing
that their Captayne at all assayes was the first himselfe,
they feared the lesse the things that they imagined.
And discending downe into the playn, they found a great
large house, sufficient for him and all his company, with
sixe thousande <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, <em class="italic">Huexozinco</em>, and <em class="italic">Chololla</em>.
And y<sup>e</sup> seruants of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> made cotages of straw
for the <em class="italic">Tamemez</em> or carriers, who were ladē with the fardage,
and victuals: there was a good supper prepared for
them, and great fires to warme them, and all things necessary.
Thither came many principall persons from <em class="italic">Mexico</em>
to visite him, among whome was a kinsman of
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, who presented vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em> the value of thrée thousand
Ducates in gold, &#38; besought him to returne backe againe,
and to haue consideration of the pouertie, hunger,
&#38; euill way, yea and to passe in litle boates in daunger of
drowning. And as for tribute to be giuen to the Emperour,
a greater summe should be appointed thē though he
went personally to <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, yea and that it should be payde
at what place he would apoint. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> welcomed them, as
reason did require, and presented vnto them haberdashe
toyes, which they estemed in much, &#38; chiefly he did louingly
entertayne <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> his kinesman, vnto whome he
made this answere, saying, I woulde gladly serue &#38; pleasure
such a mightie prince as your soueraigne <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
is, if it lay in my handes without offence of the King my
mayster, and concerning my goyng to <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
shall receyue both pleasure and honour rather than otherwise,
&#38; after I haue talked with him I will soone returne,
likewise hunger I feare not, neyther yet doubt that I nor
none of mine shall wante, and for my passage on the water,
I say it is nothing in comparison of twoo thousande
leagues, which I haue sayled onely to come and visit him.</p>

<p>But yet for all this talke, if they had founde him carelesse,
they would haue pinched him as some doth say, for
he gaue them to vnderstand that he nor his men slept not
by night, nor yet vnarmed themselues, yea and also if it
chanced thē to find in the night season any that were not
of their company, they slew them out of hād, desiring him
to aduise his men thereof, least any of them should happen
to fall into that daunger, which would much grieue him,
and with this talke they went all to take their reste.</p>

<p>The next day in the morning he proceded forward and
came to <em class="italic">Amaquemecan</em> which is two leagues frō thence, &#38;
standeth in the prouince of <em class="italic">Chalco</em>, a towne that cōtayneth
20000. householders. The Lorde of that towne presented
to <em class="italic">Cortes</em> fourtie women slaues, and .3000. Ducats in gold,
with meate abūdantly for two dayes, and secretely made
complaynt vnto him of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>. And from thence he
went to another towne foure leagues from thēce, the one
half therof was builte vpon the lake, and the other halfe
vpon the lande at the foote of a ragged hill. There went in
his company many subiectes of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> for purueyors,
but yet both they and the townes men would fayne haue
layde hand vpon the Spaniardes, and euery night would
sende their spies to sée what the Christians did, but the
watch slew about twentie of them, whervpon the matter
stayed and their pretence tooke no effect: sure it is a thing
to laugh at, for at euery fancie they woulde proue to kill
them, and yet they were not for the purpose. The nexte
day in the mornyng came twelue Lordes from <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,
among whome was <em class="italic">Cacama</em> Neuew to <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, who
was Lorde of <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em> a yong man of .xxv. yeares of age,
whom the <em class="italic">Indians</em> did much honour: he was carried vpon
their shoulders, &#38; when they set him downe one went before
with a brome to swéep the dust out of his way. These
Gentlemen came to accōpany <em class="italic">Cortes</em> excusing <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
saying that he was not well at ease &#38; therfore he came not
personally to receiue him. And yet they entreated <em class="italic">Cortes</em> to
returne backe againe, &#38; not to come vnto <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, gyuing
him to vnderstand by signes, y<sup>t</sup> they would there displease
him, yea &#38; also defend the passage &#38; entrance, a thing easie
to be done, but they were either blinded or else they durst
not breake the Calsey. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> entertayned thē like noble
mē, &#38; gaue vnto thē of his haberdashe, &#38; departed from y<sup>e</sup>
towne w<sup>t</sup> many graue personages who carried with thē a
great trayne, whiche filled vp the way well nigh as they
should passe, wōdring at their beardes, harneys, apparell,
horses &#38; ordinaunce, saying to themselues, these be Gods.
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> gaue them warning not to come among the horses,
nor among his men, for feare they would kil them. This
he made them beléeue bicause he would not haue his way
stopped, for y<sup>t</sup> the number of thē was so great. They then
came to a towne buylte vpon the water of two thousand
houses, and before they came thither they had gone more
than halfe a league vppon a fayre Calsey, whiche was
twentie foote brode: the towne had fayre houses and many
towers: the Lord of the towne did receyue them worshipfully,
and prouided all things plentifully, desiryng him to
abide there that night, and secretly made complayntes against
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, of many wrongs and exactions done by
him, and certified him, that from thence the way was very
fayre to <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and al the like calsey as he had passed.
With this newes <em class="italic">Cortes</em> was very glad, for he meant to
haue stayed there for to haue buylte barkes and foystes,
&#38; yet he feared least they woulde breake the calsey, wherfore
he had alwayes a care ouer <em class="italic">Cacama</em>, who with the other
Lordes desired him not to abide there, but to procéede
forward to <em class="italic">Iztacpalapan</em>, which was but twoo leagues off,
and that the Lorde thereof was another Neuew to <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>.
To admit their request he wēt with them to that
towne, and from thence to <em class="italic">Mexico</em> was but twoo leagues,
the which the next day he might goe at pleasure, and come
timely into the Citie, &#38; in this order came to <em class="italic">Iztacpalapan</em>.</p>

<p>Euery two houres came messengers betwixte <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
and <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>: then came <em class="italic">Cuetlauac</em> Lorde of that towne,
with the Lorde <em class="italic">Culhuacan</em> his kinsman to receyue him,
who presented vnto him, slaues, garments, and feathers,
and to the value of foure thousande Ducates in golde.
<em class="italic">Cuetlauac</em> receyued al the Spaniards into his own house,
whiche hath very fayre lodgings all of stone and Carpenters
worke excéeding well wrought, with high &#38; lowe
roumes, with all kinde of seruice: The chambers were
hanged with cloth of Cotten, very rich, after their maner.
There were fayre gardēs replenished with many swéete
floures, and swéete trées garnished with networke, made
of Canes, and couered with roses and other fine hearbes,
with sundry pondes of swéete water. There was an other
garden very beautifull of all sortes of fruytes and
hearbes, with a great ponde walled with lyme and stone,
and was foure hundreth paces square, made with fayre
steppes to discende vnto the bottome in many places, and
was full of diuers kindes of fishes, and many kinde of
water birds, which somtimes couered y<sup>e</sup> pond, as Gulles,
Mewes, and such like. <em class="italic">Iztacpallapan</em> is a towne of .10000.
households, &#38; is plāted in a lake of salt water, the one half
of the towne buylt on the water, &#38; the other on the lande.</p>

From <em class="italic">Iztacpalapan</em> to <em class="italic">Mexico</em> is twoo
leagues all vpon a fayre calsey, vpon the
which eight horsemē may passe on rāke,
and so directly straight as though it had
bene made by line. And who soeuer hath
good eiesight might discerne the gates of
<em class="italic">Mexico</em> from thence. <em class="italic">Coyoacan</em> is a towne of sixe thousande
dwellers, <em class="italic">Vizilopuchtli</em> is of fiue thousand. These townes
are planted in the lake, and are adorned with many temples,
whiche haue many fayre towers, that doe beautifie
excedingly the lake. There is great contractatiō of Salte,
which is made there, and from thence is carried abrode to
fayres and markets, whiche thing was a greate rente to
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>. Vpon this Calsey are many drawebridges
buylt vpon fayre arches that the water passeth through.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> passed this calsey with .400. Spaniardes, &#38; .6000.
<em class="italic">Indians</em> his friends: theyr passage was with much ado, by
reason of the great multitude of <em class="italic">Indians</em> which came to sée
him, &#38; cōming neare the citie, there adioyned another calsey
with a broder passage, where standeth a strong bulwark
of stone of the heigth of .ij. fadom, with two towers
on eche side, and two gates very strong. Here at this
forte came thrée thousande Courtiers and Citizens to receyue
him, &#38; euery of them touched the grounde with his
right hand and kissed it, and passed forwards in the order
as they came. These salutatiōs endured an houre &#38; more.
From the bulwark the calsey lieth directly, and before the
entraunce into the streate there is an other drawe bridge
made of timber ten paces broade, vnder the which the water
passeth too and fro. At this bridge came <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> to
receyue <em class="italic">Cortes</em> vnder a Canapie of gréene feathers &#38; golde
with much argentery hangyng thereat, whiche Canapie
foure noble men did carry. And the two princes <em class="italic">Cuetlauac</em>,
and <em class="italic">Cacama</em> his neuewes, did leade him by eache arme: all
thrée were riche appareled &#38; al of one fashion, except <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
whiche had a payre of shoes of golde besette with
pretious stones, and the soles were tied to the vpper part
with latchets, as is paynted of the Antikes. His Gentlemen
wente by two and two laying downe and taking vp
mantels and couerlets vpon the ground, bicause his féete
should not touche the same: then followed him as in procession
.200. noble men barefooted, with garments of a richer
liuery then the first thrée thousand. <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> came
in the middest of the streate, and the others came behinde
him as nigh the wal as they mought, their faces towards
the grounde, for it was a great offence to looke him in the
face. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> alighted from his horse, and according to our
vse went to embrace him, but the Princes who led him by
the armes would not suffer him to come so nigh, for they
held it for sin to touch him, but yet saluted ech one y<sup>e</sup> other.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> put about <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> his necke a coller of
Margarites, Diamondes, &#38; other stones al of glasse. <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
receyued it thankfully, &#38; wente before with one of the
princes his Neuewes, &#38; cōmaunded the other to lead <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
by the hand next after him in the middest of the streat:
and procéeding forwarde in this order, then came the Gētlemen
in the richest liuery to welcome him one by one,
touchyng the ground with their handes, &#38; after returned
to their standyng. And if the Citizens had come as they
requested, all y<sup>e</sup> day would not haue serued for salutatiōs.
The coller of glasse pleased well <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, and bycause
he woulde not take without giuyng a better thing as a
great prince, he commaunded to be brought twoo collers
of redde prawnes, which there are muche estéemed, and at
euery one of them hanged eight shrimpes of gold of excellent
workemanship, &#38; of a finger length euery one, he put
these collers with the owne hands about <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his necke,
the which was estéemed a most great fauour, yea and the
<em class="italic">Indians</em> marueled at it. At this time they were come to
the streate ende, whiche was almost a mile long, broade,
straight and very fayre and full of houses on eche side, in
whose dores, windowes and tops was such a multitude of
<em class="italic">Indians</em> to beholde the strangers, that I knowe not who
wondered most, our men to sée such a number of them, or
else they to sée our men, their ordinance &#38; horses, a thing
so straunge vnto them. They were brought vnto a great
court or house of idols, which was y<sup>e</sup> lodging of <em class="italic">Axaiaca</em>,
at the dore where of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> tooke <em class="italic">Cortes</em> by the hande
and brought him into a fayre hall, and placed him vpon a
riche carpet, saying vnto him, Sir nowe are you in your
owne house, eate and take your rest &#38; pleasure, for I wil
shortly come and visite you againe. Such (as you heare)
was the receiuing of <em class="italic">Hernando Cortes</em> by <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> a most
mightie King, into his great and famous Citie of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,

The house where the Spaniardes were lodged
was great and large, with many fayre
chambers sufficient for them all: it was
nete, cleane matted, and hanged with cloth
of Cotten, and feathers of many colours,
pleasant to behold. When <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> was departed frō
<em class="italic">Cortes</em>, he began to sette his house in order, and placed the
ordinaunce at his dore, and hauing all his things in good
sorte, he went to a sumptuous dinner that was prepared
for him. As soone as <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> had made an ende of his
dinner hearyng that the straungers were rysen from
the table, and reposed a while, then came he to <em class="italic">Cortes</em>,
salutyng him, and satte downe by him. He gaue vnto him
diuers iewels of gold plate, feathers, and many garmēts
of Cotten, both riche, well woven, &#38; wrought of straunge
colours, a thing comely, that did manifest his greatnesse,
and also cōfirme their imagination. This gifte was deliuered
honorably, and then began his talke as foloweth:
Lorde and Gentlemen, I doe much reioyce to haue in my
house such valiant men as ye are, for to vse you with curtesie,
and entreate you with honour, according to your deserte
and my estate. And where heretofore I desired that
you shoulde not come hither, the onely cause was, my
people had a greate feare to sée you, for your gesture
&#38; grimme beards did terrifie them, yea, they reported that
yée had such beastes as swallowed men, and that your cōming
was frō heauen, bringing with you lightning, thunder
&#38; thūderbolts, wherwith you made the earth to trēble
&#38; to shake, and that yée slew therewith whom ye pleased.
But now I do sée &#38; know that you are mortall mē, &#38; that
ye are quiet &#38; hurt no man: also I haue séene your horses,
which are but your seruauntes, and youre Gunnes lyke
vnto shootyng Trunkes. I do now hold all for fables and
lyes which hath bin reported of you, and I do also accept
you for my méere kinsmen. My father tolde me that hée
had heard his forefathers say, of whome I doe descende,
that they helde opinion howe they were not naturals of
thys lande, but come hither by chance, in companye of a
mighty Lorde, who after a while that they hadde abode
héere, they returned to their natiue soyle: After manye
yeares expyred, they came agayne for those whome they
had left héere behind them, but they would not goe wyth
them, bycause they had héere inhabited, and hadde wyues
and children, and great gouernement in the land. Nowe
these myghtie Lords séeyng that they were so stubborne,
and woulde not returne with them, departed from them
sore displeased, saying, that he woulde sende his children
that should both rule and gouerne them, in iustice, peace,
and auntient Religion, and for this consideration, wée
haue alwayes expected and beléeued, that suche a people
should come to rule and gouerne vs, and cōsidering from
whence you come, I doe thinke that you are they whome
we looked for, and the notice which the greate Emperour
<em class="italic">Charles</em> had of vs, who hath now sent you hither. Therefore
Lorde and Captayne, be well assured, that we wyll
obey you, if there be no fayned or deceytefull matter in
your dealings, and will also deuide wyth you and youres
all that we haue. And although this which I haue sayde
were not only for youre vertue, fame, and déedes of valiant
Gentlemen, I would yet do it for your worthinesse
in the battayles of <em class="italic">Tauasco</em>, <em class="italic">Teocazinco</em>, and <em class="italic">Chololla</em>, béeyng
so few, to ouercome so many.</p>

<p>Now agayne, if ye ymagine that I am a God, and the
walles and routes of my houses, and all my vessell of seruice
to be of pure golde, as the men of <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em>,
<em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, and <em class="italic">Huexozinco</em> hath enformed you, it is not so, and
I iudge you to be so wise, that you giue no credit to such
fables. You shall also note, that through your commyng
hither, manye of my subiectes haue rebelled, and are become
my mortall enimies, but yet I purpose to breake
their wings. Come féele you my body, I am of fleshe and
bone, a mortal man as others are, and no God, although
as a King I doe estéeme my selfe of a greater dignitie
and preheminēce than others. My houses you do also sée,
which are of tymber and earthe, and the principallest of
Masons worke, therefore nowe you do both knowe and
sée what odious lyars those talebearers were. But troth
it is, that golde plate, feathers, armour, iewels, and other
riches, I haue in the treasory of my forefathers a long
time preserued, as the vse of Kings is, all the which you &#38;
yours shal enioy at all times. And now it may please you
to take your rest, for I know that you are wéery of your
iourney. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> with ioyfull countenance humbled himselfe,
séeing some teares fall from <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> his eyes,
saying vnto him, vppon the trust I haue hadde in youre
clemencye, I insisted to come both to sée and talke wyth
your highnesse, and now I know that all are lyes which
hath bin tolde me. The like youre highnesse hath hearde
reported of vs, assure youre selfe, that the Emperoure
Kyng of <em class="italic">Spayne</em> is your naturall Lorde, whome yée haue
expected for, he is the onely heyre from whence youre lynage
dothe procéede, and as touching the offer of youre
highnesse treasure, I do most hartyly thanke you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A louing aunsvvere.</div>

<p>After all this communication, <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> demaunded
whether the bearded men whiche came with him, were
eyther his vassals or his slaues, bycause he would entertayne
eache one according to his estate. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> aunswered,
that they were all his bréethren, friendes, and fellowes,
except some that were his seruauntes.</p>

<p>Then he departed, and wente home to his Pallace,
and there enformed himselfe particularlye who were
Gentlemen, and who were not, and according therevnto,
sent euery one particular gift or present. To the Gentlemen
he sente the rewarde by his Controller, and to the
Marriners &#38; other seruitors, by a Page of his housholde.</p>

Mvtezuma was a man of a small stature
and leane, his couloure tawnie as all the
<em class="italic">Indians</em> are. He hadde long heare on hys
heade, sixe little heares vppon him, as
though they hadde bin put in with a bodkin.
His thinne bearde was blacke. Hée
was a man of a fayre condition, and a doer of Iustice,
well spoken, graue and wise, beloued and feared among
his subiectes. <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> doth signifie sadnesse.</p>

<p>To y<sup>e</sup> proper names of Kings and Lords, they do adde
this sillable C. whiche is for cortesie and dignitie, as
we vse Lord. The Turke vseth <em class="italic">Zultan</em>. The Moore or
Barbarian calleth his Lorde <em class="italic">Mulley</em>, and so the <em class="italic">Indians</em>
say <em class="italic">Mutezumazin</em>. His people hadde him in such reuerence,
that he permitted none to sit in his sight, nor yet in
his presence to weare shoes, nor looke him in the face, except
very few Princes. He was glad of the conuersation
of the <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em>, and would not suffer them to stande on
foote, for the great estimation he had of them, and if he lyked
any of the <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em> garments, he woulde exchange
his apparrell for theirs.</p>

<p>He changed his owne apparell foure times euery day,
and he neuer clothed himselfe agayne with the garmentes
whiche he hadde once worne, but all suche were
kept in his Guardrobe, for to giue in presents to his seruantes
and Ambassadors, and vnto valiante souldyers
which had takē any enimie prisoner, and that was estéemed
a great reward, and a title of priuiledge.</p>

<p>The costly mātels whereof had bin diuers sent to <em class="italic">Cortes</em>,
were of the same Guardrobe.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> went alwayes very net and fine in hys attire.
He bathed him in his hotehouse foure times euerye
day. He went seldome out of his Chamber, but when hée
went to his meate. He eate alwayes alone, but solemnelye
and with great abundance. His table was a pillowe,
or else a couple of coulloured skynnes. His Chayre was
a fourefooted stole made of one péece, and hollowe in the
middest, well wroughte and paynted. His table clothes,
napkins and towels were made of Cotten woll, verye
white and newe, for he was neuer serued but once wyth
that naperie. Foure hundred Pages broughte in hys
meate, all sonnes of greate Lordes, and placed it vppon a
table in his greate Hall. The meate béeyng broughte in,
then came <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> to beholde the dishes, and appoynted
those dishes that liked him best, and chafing dishes
were prepared to kéepe that meate warme, and seldome
would eate of any other dish, except the Lord Stewarde
or Controller should highly commende any other dishe.</p>

<p>Before he sate downe, came twentie of his wiues of
the fayrest and best estéemed, or else those that serued
wéekely by turne, broughte in the bason and ewer, wyth
greate humblenesse. This done, he sate him downe, and
then came the Lord Steward, and drewe a wodden nette
before him, bycause none shoulde come nigh his table.
And this noble man alone placed the dishes, and also
tooke them away, for the Pages who broughte in the
meate came not néere the table, nor yet spake any word,
nor no man else.</p>

<p>While the Lord <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> was at his meate, excepte
some Iester, they al serued him barefooted. There assisted
alwayes somewhat a farre off, sixe auntiente and noble
men, vnto whome he vsed to giue of the dish that best lyked
him, who receyued the same at his hande with greate
reuerence, and eate it incontinent, without loking in his
face, whiche was the greatest humilitie that they coulde
vse before him. He had musike of Fiddle, Flute, and of a
Snayle shell, and a Caudron couered with a skinne, and
suche other strange instrumentes. They hadde very euill
voyces to sing. Always at dinner time he had Dwarfes,
crookebackes, and other deformed counterfets, all for
maiestie and to laugh at, who hadde their meate in the
Hall among the Iesters and Idyots, whiche were fedde
with parte of the meate that came from <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> hys
table, all the rest of the meate was giuen to thrée thousand
of the Guard, who attended ordinarily in the yarde
or court, and therefore they say that there was broughte
for his table thrée thousande dishes, and as manye pottes
of wine, suche as they vse, and that continually the buttrey
and Pantrey stoode open, whiche was a wonder to
sée what was in them. The platters, dishes, and cuppes,
were al of earth, whereof the King was serued but once,
and so frō meale to meale new. He had likewise his seruice
of golde and plate verye riche, but he vsed not to bée
serued with it, (they say) bycause he woulde not be serued
twice therewith, the whiche he thoughte a base thing.
Some affirme, that yong children were slayne and dressed
in diuers kind of dishes for <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> his table, but
it was not so, only of mans flesh sacrifised he fedde nowe
and then. The table being taken vp, then came againe
the Gentlewomen to bring water for his hands, with the
like reuerēce as they vsed at the first, and then went they
to dinner with the other wiues, so that then the Gentlemen
and Pages waited as their course fell.</p>

When his table was taken vp, and his seruitors
gone to meate, <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> sate stil:
then came in the suiters that hadde any
affayres to deale with him, barefoted, for
all the persons did vse that reuerence, excepte
some Princes his kinsmen, as the
Lordes of <em class="italic">Tescuco</em>, and <em class="italic">Tlacopan</em>, and a fewe others: and
béeing colde weather, they vsed to weare olde ragged
clothes vppon theyr riche garmentes. Al suiters vsed to
make thrée or foure curtesies, not loking toward his face,
and speaking vnto him their heads downewardes, and in
that order retyred backe agayne. <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> aunswered
his suiters very grauely, with lowe voyce, and in fewe
words, and not to al suiters, for others his secretaries or
counsellers that stoode by, answered for him, and hauyng
their aunswere, they returned backewardes, not turning
their tayles to the prince. After these businesses done, hée
vsed some recreation, hearing Iesters or songs, wherein
he delighted much, or else to looke vpon the players, who
play with their féete, as we doe with oure handes. These
haue a cudgell like vnto a pastlers rowler, whiche they
tosse high and lowe, as it were a bal in the ayre, straunge
to beholde. They vse other playes to passe the tyme, in
such an order, that it séemed maruellous to the lookers on.
<em class="italic">Cortez</em> broughte into <em class="italic">Spayne</em> some of these players. Also
they vse <em class="italic">Matachines</em>, in suche sorte they do play, that they
stand each vppon others shoulders, and he that standeth
highest, sheweth many feates. Sometime <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
did beholde the players, who played at a game called
<em class="italic">Patoliztli</em>, whiche is muche like oure Tables, and they play
with beanes, squared like dice, which they call <em class="italic">Patolli</em>, and
throw them out of both their hands vpon a matte, or else
vpon the ground, where are made certaine strikes, vpon
which they set downe the chance that is throwen: and at
this game they play all that they haue, and many tymes
they valew theyr owne bodyes, and play that into captiuitie,
and to remayne a slaue, I meane such as are common
gamesters of small estate.</p>

<img class="drop-cap isize7" src="images/i187.jpg" width="110" height="115" alt="" />
Sometimes <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> went to the Tennis
Courte. Their ball is called <em class="italic">Villamaliztli</em>,
and is made of the gumme which commeth
from a trée called <em class="italic">Vlli</em>. This trée groweth
in a hote Countrey. The gumme being
kneded togither, and so made roūd, is as blacke as pitch,
and somewhat heauie, and very harde for the hande, but
yet good and light to rebound, and better than our windballes.
They play not at chases, but at bādie, or at check,
that is, if the ball touch the wall, it loseth. They maye
strike the ball with any part of their body, but there is alwayes
a penaltie if they only strike not with the buttoke
or side, whiche is the finest play: wherefore they vse a
skynne vpon eache buttocke. They play so many to so
many for a packe of mantels, or according to the abilitie
of the players. Also they play for golde and feathers, and
sometime for their owne bodyes, as they vse at <em class="italic">Patolli</em>,
which is there permitted &#38; lawfull. The Tennis Court
is called <em class="italic">Tlachco</em>, and is a Hall long and narrow, but wyder
vpwards, than downewardes, and higher on the sides
than at y<sup>e</sup> ends, which is an industrie for their play. The
house is always white and smooth in the side walles: they
haue certain stones like vnto mylstones, w<sup>t</sup> a little hole in
the middest that passeth through the stone, the hole is so
small, that scarcely the ball maye passe through, but hée
that chanceth to strike the ball into the hole, whiche seldome
happeneth, winneth the game, and by an auntiente
lawe and custome among Tennis players, he ought to
haue the clokes of all those that stande and beholde the
play, on that side that the ball went in, and in some Tennis
Courtes, the halfe of the garmentes of them that
stande lookyng on. The winner is then bounde to make
certayne sacrifice to the God of the Tennis play, and
to the stone where the ball entred. The beholders of the
play woulde saye, that suche a wynner should be a thiefe
and an adulterer, or else that he shoulde dye quickly.</p>

<p>They vsed in the Temple of the Tennis play two Images
of the God of the ball, which stoode vpon the two
lower walles. Their Sacrifice was celebrated at midnighte,
with many Ceremonies and Witchcraftes, and
songs for that purpose. Then came a Prieste from the
Cathedrall Churche, wyth other Religious persons to
blesse the Sacrifice, saying certayne diuelishe prayers,
and throwing the ball four tymes in the Tennis Court.
In thys order was the Tennis play consecrated, and after
thys consecration it was lawfull to play, or else not,
for this dilligence was firste to be done when any Tennis
Court or play was newly built.</p>

<p>The owner of the Tennis Courte also woulde neuer
suffer any to play, vntill he had first offered something to
the Idoll, theyr superstition was so great.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> broughte the <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em> to behold this pastyme,
and gaue thē to vnderstande, y<sup>t</sup> he delyghted much
in thys game, and also to sée our men play at Cardes and
Dyce.</p>

The number of vviues that Mutezuma

<p class="drop-cap">
<img class="drop-cap isize5" src="images/i189.jpg" width="190" height="182" alt="" />
<em class="italic">Mvtezuma</em> had many houses as wel in <em class="italic">Mexico</em>
as without, for his recreation and pleasure,
as also for his ordinary dwelling. To
write of al it should be tedious, but where
his continual abyding was, he named <em class="italic">Tepac</em>,
that is to say, Pallace. And that Pallace had twenty
dores or gates which had their outcomming into the cōmon
streates.</p>

<p>It hath thrée courtes, and in the one standeth a fayre
fountaine, many halles, and a hundred chambers of twentie-thrée,
and thirtie foote long, an hundered bathes &#38; hothouses:
and although the building was without nayles,
yet very good workmanship.</p>

<p>The walles were made of masons work, and wrought
of Marble, Iaspe, and other blacke stone, with vaines of
redde, like vnto rubies and other stones, whiche glistered
very fayre: the Rooffes wer wrought of Tymber, and curiously
carued: the Timber was Cedre, Cipers, &#38; Pynetree:
the chambers were painted and hong with cloth of
cotten, and clothe made of Conneys haire and feathers.
The beddes were poore and of no vallew, for they were
nothing but Mantels layde vpon mattes, or vpon Hay, or
else mattes alone: fewe men lay within those houses.</p>

<p>There were a thousande women, and some affyrme y<sup>t</sup>
there were thrée thousand, accounting gentlewomen, seruaunts
and slaues: the most were noble mens daughters,
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> toke of them for himselfe, those that liked him
best, and the others he gaue in mariage to Gentlemen
his seruaunts.</p>

<p>The saying was that he had at one tyme a hundreth &#38;
fiftie women hys wiues with childe, who through the
perswasion of the Deuill tooke Medicines to caste theyr
creatures, bycause they knewe that they shoulde not inherite
the state: these hys wiues had many olde women
for their Guarde, for no man was permitted to looke
vpon them.</p>

<p>The shielde of armes that is sette in his pallayce, and
likewyse carried to the warres, is an Eagle soryng vpon
a Tiger hys talents bente as takyng pray. Some thynk
it is a Gryphon and not an Egle. The Gryphons in time
paste, say they, did cause the vale of <em class="italic">Auacatlan</em>
to be dispeopled,
for they were greate deuourers of menne, and
that theyr abidyng was in the Mountaynes of <em class="italic">Teoacan</em>:
they approue that these Mountains were called <em class="italic">Cuitlachtepelt</em>,
of <em class="italic">Cuitlachtli</em>, which is a Gryphon bigger than a
Lion: but the Spaniardes dyd neuer sée any of them.</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">Indians</em> by theyr olde Pictures doe paynt those
Gryphons to haue a kynde of heare and no feathers, and
also affirme, that with theyr talandes &#38; téeth they breake
mens bones. They haue the courage of a Lion and the
countenaunce of an Egle: they paynte him with foure
féete, and téeth, with a kinde of downe more lyke woolle
than feathers, with his beake, talandes and wings.</p>

<p>And in all those things the picture agreeth with our
paynting and wryting, in suche sorte that a Gryphon is
no approued naturall Foule, nor yet beast. <em class="italic">Plinie</em> iudgeth
this tale of Gryphons to be lies. There are also other
Lordes that giue the Gryphon in their armes, flying with
a harte in his Talandes.</p>

<em class="italic">Mvtezuma</em> had another house, with
very good lodgings and fayre gallaries,
buylt vpō pillers of Iaspe,
whiche extendeth towarde a goodly
garden, in the whiche there are
ten pondes or moe, some of salte
water for sea foule, &#38; other some
of fresh water for riuer foule and
lake foule, which pondes are deuised w<sup>t</sup> sluyses to emptie
&#38; to fill at their pleasure for the cleannesse of the feathers.
There is such a number of foule, that scarcely the ponds
may holde them, and of suche diuers kindes bothe in feathers
and makyng, as sure it was an admiration for the
Spaniardes to beholde, for the moste of them they knew
not, nor yet had at any tyme séene the lyke. And to euery
kynde of foule they gaue suche bayte as they were wont
to féede of in the fieldes or Riuers. There did belong to
that house thrée hundred persons of seruice: some were to
clense the pondes: other some did fishe for bayte: other
some serued them with meate: other did loose them and
trimme theyr feathers: others had care to looke to their
egges: others to sette them abroode: others cured them
when they were sicke: and the principallest office was
to plucke the feathers: for of them was made riche Mantels,
Tapissarie, Targattes, Tuffes of feathers, and many
other things wrought with Golde and Siluer: a most
perfite worke.</p>

There is another house with large quarters
&#38; lodgings, which is called a house
for foule, not bycause there are more thā
in the other, but bycause they bee bigger
and to hauke withal, and are foule of rapine,
wherfore they are estéemed as more
nobler than al the others.</p>

<p>There are in this house many high halles, in the whiche
are kept men, women and Children: in some of them
are kept suche as are borne white of colour, which doth
very seldome happen: in other some are dwarfes, crokebackes,
burstenmen, counterfaites, and monstrous persons,
in greate number: they say that they vsed to deforme
them when they were children, to sette forth the
kings greatnesse: euery of these persons were in seuerall
Halles by themselues.</p>

<p>In the lower Halles were greate Cages made of
Tymber: in some of them were Lyons, in other Tygres,
in other Ownzes, in others Wolues: in conclusion, there
was no foure footed beaste that wanted there, onely to
the effect that the mightie <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> might say that hee
had such things in his house.</p>

<p>They were fed with their ordinary, as Gynea cockes,
Deare, Dogges, and such like.</p>

<p>There was also in other Halles great Earthen vessels,
some with earth, and some with water, wherin were
snakes, as grosse as a mans thigh, Vipers, Crocodrilles,
whiche they cal <em class="italic">Caymanes</em>, or <em class="italic">Lizarts</em> of twenty foote long,
wyth suche Scales and head as a Dragon hathe: Also
other little Lisarts, and other venemous beastes and
Serpentes as well of the water as of the land, a terrible
sight for the lokers on.</p>

<p>There were also other Cages for foule of rapyne of
all sortes, as Hawkes, Kyghtes, Boyters, and at the
least nine or ten kind of Haukes. This house of foule had
of dayly allowance fiue hundred Gynea cockes, and thrée
hundred men of seruice, besides the Falconers and Hunters,
which are infinite. There were many other sortes of
Foules that our men knowe not, which séemed by theyr
beake and talents good to Hauke withal.</p>

<p>To the Snakes and other venemous beastes they
gaue the bloude of men sacrifised, to féede them, and some
saye they gaue vnto them mannes fleshe, whych the
greate Lysarts doe eate very well. The Spaniardes
saw the floure couered with bloud like a iealy in a slaughter
house, it stonke horribly.</p>

<p>It was straunge to sée the officers in this house
howe euery one was occupied. Our men tooke greate
pleasure in beholding suche straunge thyngs, but they
coulde not awaye wyth the roaryng of the Lyons,
the fearefull hissing of the Snakes and Adders, the
dolefull howling and barking of the Wolues, the sorowfull
yelling of the Ownzes &#38; Tigres, when they would
haue meate.</p>

<p>Moste certaine, in the nighte season it séemed a
Dongeon of Hell, and a dwelling place of the Deuill,
and euen so it was indéede, for neare at hande was a
Hall of a hūdred &#38; fiftie foote long, and thirtie foote broad,
where was a Chappel with the Roofe of siluer and gold
in leafe Wainescotted, and decked with greate store
of pearle and stone, as Agattes, Cornerines, Emeraldes,
Rubies, and diuerse other sortes, and thys was the
Oratory where <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> prayed in the nighte season,
and in that chappell the Diuell did appeare vnto hym,
and gaue him answere accordyng to his prayers.</p>

<p>He had other houses lyke vnto Barnes, onely for the
feathers of foules, and for mantels whiche procéeded of
his rentes and tributes, a thing muche to be séene: vpon
the dores was sette his armes, whiche was a Connie.</p>

<p>Here dwelled the chiefe officers of his house, as Tresorer,
Controller, Receyuers and other officers appertainyng
to the Kings reuenewes. <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> had no house
wherein was not an oratory for the Deuill, whome they
worshipped for the Iewels there. And therefore those
houses were great and large.</p>

<h2 id="chap68">The Armory of Mutezuma.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">

<em class="italic">Mvtezuma</em> had some houses of
Armour, vpon the dores wherof
stoode a bow and arrowes.
In these houses was greate
store of all kinde of munition
whiche they vse in their wars:
as Bowes, Arrowes, Slings,
Launces, Dartes, Clubbes,
Swordes and Bucklers, and
gallant Targettes more trimme than strong, Skulles
and Splintes, but not many, and al made of woodde,
gilte or couered with leather. The woodde whereof they
make their Armour and Targettes, is very harde and
strong, for they vse to toaste it at the fire, and at
their arrowe endes they inclose a litle péece of flinte
stone, or a péece of a fishe bone called <em class="italic">Libisa</em>, and that
is venemous, for if any bée hurte therewith and the
head remayne in the wounde, it so festereth, that it is almost
incurable.</p>

<p>Theyr swordes are of woodde, and the edge thereof is
flint stone, inclosed or ioyned into a staffe, with a certaine
kynde of glew whiche is made of a roote called <em class="italic">Zacole</em>
and <em class="italic">Teuxalli</em>, whiche is a kinde of strong sande, whereof
they make a mixture, and after kneade it with bloud of
Battes or Rearemice and other foule, which doth glewe
maruelous strong, and lightly neuer vncleaueth: of this
stuffe they make nayles, pearcers, &#38; ogars, wherwith they
bore timber &#38; stone: with theyr swordes they cut speares,
yea and a horse necke at a blowe, and make dentes into
iron, whiche séemeth a thing vnpossible and incredible.
In the Citie no man may weare weapon, but onely in
warres, huntyng, and among the kings Guarde.</p>

Besides the foresayde houses hée had many
others for hys onely recreation and
passetyme, with excellent fayre gardens
of medicinall hearbes, swéete floures, and
trées of delectable sauour, whiche were
many, and a thing to gyue prayse to God the maker and
creator of all.</p>

<p>In that Garden were a thousande personages, made
and wrought artificially of leaues and flowers. <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
woulde not permitte that in this Garden shoulde
be any kynde of potte Hearbes, or thyngs to be solde,
saying, that it dyd not appertayne to Kings to haue
thyngs of profite among theyr delytes and pleasures,
for suche thyngs (sayde hée) dyd appertayne to Merchants.</p>

<p>Yet notwithstanding he had Orchards with many and
sundry fruites, but they stoode farre from the Cittie, and
whyther seldome times hee wente: he had likewise out
of <em class="italic">Mexico</em> pleasaunte houses in wooddes and forrestes, of
greate compasse, enuyroned with water, in the which he
hadde fountaynes, riuers, pondes with fishe, warrantes
of Conneys, rockes &#38; couert where were Harts, Buckes,
Hares, Foxes, Wolues, and such like, with wildernesse
for euery sort.</p>

<p>To these places the Lords of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, vsed to goe and

He had dayly attending vppon

garde sixe hundred noble
men and gentlemen, and
eche of them thrée or foure
seruants, and some hadde
twenty seruaunts or moe,
according to his estate: and
in this maner he had thrée
thousand men attendant in
his court, and some affirm
more, al the which were fed in his house of the meate that
came from his table.</p>

<p>The seruing men alwayes abode belowe in the court
all the daye, and wente not from thence tyll after Supper.</p>

<p>It is to be thought that his Guard was the greater,
bycause the straungers were there, although in effecte of
troth it is most certayne, that all the Lords that are vnder
the <em class="italic">Mexicall</em> Empire (as they say) are thirtie persons
of high estate, who are able to make each of them a hundred
thousand men. There are thrée thousand Lordes of
Townes, who haue many vassals.</p>

<p>These noble menne did abide in <em class="italic">Mexico</em> certayne tyme
of the yeare, in the Court of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, and could not departe
from thence without especiall licence of the Emperoure,
leauing each of them a sonne or brother behinde

There is not in all the dominions of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
any subiect that payeth not tribute
vnto him. The noblemen paye theyr
tribute in personall seruice. The husbādmen
called <em class="italic">Maceualtin</em>, with body &#38; goodes.
In this sort they are eyther tenauntes, or
else heyres to their possessions. Those which are heyres,
do pay one third part of all their fruite and commoditie
that they doe reape or bring vp, as Dogges, Hennes,
Foule, Conyes, Gold, Siluer, Stones, Salt, Waxe, Honey,
Mantels, Feathers, Cotten, and a certayne fruite
called <em class="italic">Cacao</em>, that serueth for money, and also to eate. Also
all kinde of grayne, and garden Herbes and fruites,
whereof they do maynteyne themselues.</p>

<p>The Tenantes doe paye monethly or yearely as they
can agrée, and bycause their tribute is greate, they are
called slaues, for when they maye haue licence to eate
egges, they thinke it a greate fauour. It was reported
that they were taxed what they shoulde eate, and all the
residue was taken from them. They went very poorely
clothed, yea and the most of their treasure was an earthē
potte, wherein they boyled theyr herbes, a couple of Milstones
to grinde their Corne, and a matte to lye vppon.
They did not onely pay this rente and tribute, but also
serued with their bodyes at all times when the great
King should commaunde. They were in such great subiectiō
to their prince, that they durst not speake one word,
although their daughters shoulde be taken from them to
be vsed at their pleasure. It was reported, that of euerye
thrée sonnes, they deliuered one to be sacrifised, but y<sup>e</sup> report
was false, for if it had bin true, the Townes had not
bin so replenished with people as they were: and also the
noble men did not eate mans flesh, but only of those whiche
were sacrifised, and they were slaues or prisoners taken
in the warres. Assuredly they were cruell butchers,
and slewe yearely for that bloudy sacrifice many menne,
and some children, but not so many as was reported. All
the aforesayde rentes they brought to <em class="italic">Mexico</em> vpon theyr
backes and in boates, I meane so much as was necessary
for the prouision of the house and Courte of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
all the residue was spente among souldyers, and bartred
for golde, plate, precious stones, and other riche Iewels,
estéemed of Princes, all the whiche was broughte to the
treasory. In <em class="italic">Mexico</em> was large and greate barnes and
houses to receyue and kéepe the Corne for prouision of
the Citie, with officers and vnderofficers, who did receyue
the same, and kepte accompte thereof in bookes of
paynted figures. Also in euerye Towne was a receyuer,
who bare in his hand a rodde or a bushe of feathers,
and those gaue vp their accomptes in <em class="italic">Mexico</em>. If any such
had bin taken with deceypt and falsehoode, death was his
reward, yea and his kinred punished with penalties, as
of a lignage of a Traytor to his Prince. The Husbandmenne,
if they payd not well their tribute, were apprehended
for the same, and if they were founde to bée poore
through sicknesse and infirmitie, then they were borne
withall, but if they were found to be lazie and slouthfull,
they should be vsed accordingly: but in conclusion, if they
payde if not at a daye appoynted, then they shoulde bée
solde for slaues to pay their dette, or else be sacrificed.</p>

<p>There were many other prouinces, whiche paid a certayne
portion, and reknowledged seruice, but this tribute
was more of honor than profite. In this sort <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
had more than sufficiente to prouide his house &#38; warres,
and to heape vp greate store in his treasory. Moreouer, he
spente nothing in the buildings of his houses, for of long
time he had certayne townes that payd no other tribute,
but only to worke and repayre continually his houses at
their owne proper cost, and payde all kind of workemen,
carrying vpon their backes, or drawing in sleddes, stone,
lyme, timber, water, and all other necessaries for the
worke. Likewise they were bounde to prouide all the
fierwod that should be spent in the Court, whiche was a
great thing, and did amount to 230. hūdred waight a day,
which was fiue hundred mens burthens, and some dayes
in the winter much more. And for the Kings Chimneys
they brought the barke of Oke trées, whiche was best estéemed
for the light thereof, for they were greate sorcerers.
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> had 100. cities with their prouinces, of
whome he receiued rentes, tributes, &#38; vassalage, where he
mainteined garrison of souldiers, &#38; had treasorers in each
of thē. His dominiō did extend from the North sea to the
South sea, &#38; 600. miles in lōgitude within the maine lād,
although in very déed ther were some towns, as <em class="italic">Tlaxcallō</em>,
<em class="italic">Mechuacan</em>, <em class="italic">Panuco</em>, and <em class="italic">Teocantepec</em>,
whiche were his enimies,
and payde him neyther tribute nor seruice: but yet
the ransome was muche, when any of them were taken.</p>

<p>Also there were other kings and noble men, as of <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>
and <em class="italic">Tlacopan</em>, which were not in subiection vnto him,
but onely in homage and obedience, for they were of his
owne lignage, vnto whome <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> married hys
daughters.</p>

<em class="italic">Mexico</em> at the time when <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
entred, was a Citie of sixtye
thousande houses. The Kings
house and other noble mens
houses were great, large, and
beautifull, the others were
small and roynish, without eyther
dores or windowes: and
although they were small, yet
there dwelled in some of them two, thrée, yea and tenne
persons, by reason whereof, the Citie was wonderfully
replenished with people.</p>

<p>This Citie is built vpon the water, euen in the same
order as <em class="italic">Venice</em> is. All the body of the Citie standeth in a
greate large lake of water. There is thrée sortes of
stréetes very broade and fayre, the one sorte are onely of
water, with many bridges, an other sort of onely earth,
and the thirde of earth and water, that is to saye, the one
halfe earth to walke vpon, and the other halfe for boates
to bring prouision of all sorts. These stréetes are kepte
alwayes cleane, and the moste parte of the houses haue
two dores, the one towarde the calsey, and the other towarde
the water, at the whiche they take boate to goe
where they list. And although this Citie is founded vppon
water, yet the same water is not good to drynke,
wherefore there is broughte by conduit water from a
place called <em class="italic">Chapultepec</em>, thrée myles distant from the Citie,
which springeth out of a little hill, at the foote whereof
standeth two Statues or couered Images wrought
in stone, with their Targettes and Launces, the one is
of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, and the other of <em class="italic">Axaiaca</em> his father.</p>

<p>The water is broughte from thence in two pypes or
Canalls in greate quantitie, and when the one is foule,
then all the water is conuayed into the other, til the first
be made cleane. From this fountayne al the whole Citie
is prouided, so that they goe selling the same water from
stréete to stréete in little boates, and doe paye a certayne
tribute for the same.</p>

<p>This Citie is deuided into two stréetes, the one was
called <em class="italic">Tlatelulco</em>, that is to say, a litle Iland, and the other
<em class="italic">Mexico</em>, where <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> his dwelling and courte was,
&#38; is to be interpreted a spring. This stréete is the fayrest
and most principall, and bycause of the Kings pallace
there, the Citie was named <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, although the old and
first name of the Citie was <em class="italic">Tenuchtitlan</em>, whiche doth signifie
fruite out of stone, for the name is compounded of
<em class="italic">Tetl</em>, which is, stone, and <em class="italic">Nuchtli</em>, which is fruite, called in
<em class="italic">Cuba</em>, <em class="italic">Tunas</em>. The trée that beareth this fruite, is named
<em class="italic">Nopal</em>, and is nothing almost but leaues of a foote broade
and round, and thrée ynches thicke, some more, and some
lesse, according to the growth, full of thornes whiche are
venemous: the leafe is gréene, and the thorne or pricke
russet. After that it is planted, it encreaseth, growing
leafe vnto leafe, and the foote thereof commeth to bée as
the body of a trée, and one leafe dothe not onely produce
another at the poynt, but at the sides of the same leaues
procéedeth other leaues: And bycause héere in <em class="italic">Spayne</em> is
of the same trées and fruite, it néedeth no further description.</p>

<p>In some prouinces where water is scante, they vse to
drynke the iuice of these leaues. The fruite thereof called
<em class="italic">Nuchtli</em>, is lyke vnto fygges, and euen so hathe hys
little kernels or graynes within, but they are somewhat
larger, and crowned lyke vnto a Medler. There are of
them of sundrye coloures, some are gréene without, and
Carnationlike within, which haue a good tast. Others
are yellowe, and others white, and some speckled: the best
sort are the white: it is a fruite that will last long.</p>

<p>Some of them tasteth of peares, and other some of
Grapes: it is a colde and fresh fruite, and best estéemed
in the heate of Sommer. The <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em> doe more estéeme
them than the <em class="italic">Indians</em>. The more the grounde is
laboured where they growe, the fruite is so muche the
better.</p>

<p>There is yet another kinde of this fruite redde, and
that is nothing estéemed, although his tast is not euill,
but bycause it dothe coloure and dye the eaters mouth,
lippes, and apparell, yea and maketh his vryne looke like
pure bloud. Many <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em> at their first comming into
<em class="italic">India</em>, and eating this fruite, were in a maze, and at their
wittes ende, thinking that all the bloud in their bodyes
came out in vryne: yea and manye Phisitions at theyr
first comming were of the same beliefe: for it hathe happened,
when they haue bin sent for vnto such as haue eaten
this fruite, they not knowing the cause, and beholding
the vryne, by and by they ministred medicine to
staunch bloud: surely a thing to laugh at, to sée the Phisitions
so deceyued. Of this fruite <em class="italic">Nuchtli</em> and <em class="italic">Tetl</em>, which
is a stone, is compounded <em class="italic">Tenuchtlitan</em>. When this Citie
was begunne to bée founded, it was placed néere vnto
a great stone that stoode in the middest of the lake, at the
foote whereof grewe one of these <em class="italic">Nopal</em> trées, and therefore
<em class="italic">Mexico</em> giueth for armes and deuise the foote of a
<em class="italic">Nopal</em> trée springing from a stone, according to the Cities
name.</p>

<p>Others do affirme, that this Citie hathe the name of
his first founder, called <em class="italic">Tenuch</em>, béeyng the seconde sonne
of <em class="italic">Iztacmixcoatl</em>, whose sonnes and descendentes did first
inhabite thys lande of <em class="italic">Ananac</em>, called nowe newe
<em class="italic">Spayne</em>.</p>

<p>Howsoeuer the opinions are, certayne it is that the
scituation is called <em class="italic">Tenuchtlitan</em>, and the dwellers there
<em class="italic">Tenuchca Mexico</em>.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Mexico</em> is as much to say, as a spring or fountayne, according
to the propertie of the vowell and spéech.</p>

<p>Others doe affirme, that <em class="italic">Mexico</em> hathe his name of a
more auntiente time, whose firste founders were called
<em class="italic">Mexiti</em>, for vnto this day the <em class="italic">Indian</em> dwellers in one strete
of this citie are called of <em class="italic">Mexica</em>. The <em class="italic">Mexiti</em> tooke name
of their principallest Idoll called <em class="italic">Mexitli</em>, who was in as
greate veneration as <em class="italic">Vitzilopuchtli</em>, God of the warre.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Mexico</em> is enuironed with swéete water, and hathe
thrée wayes to come vnto it by calsey, the one is from
the West, and that calsey is a mile and a halfe long.
Another from the North, and conteyneth thrée myles
in length. Eastwarde the Citie hathe no entrye. But
Southwarde the Calsey is syxe myles long, whyche
was the waye that <em class="italic">Cortez</em> entred into the Citie.</p>

<p>The lake that <em class="italic">Mexico</em> is planted in, although it séemeth
one, yet it is two, for the one is of water saltishe,
bitter, and pestiferous, and no kinde of fyshe lyueth in
it. And the other water is wholesome, good and swéete,
and bringeth forth small fishe.</p>

<p>The salte water ebbeth and floweth, accordyng
to the winde that bloweth. The swéete water standeth
higher, so that the good water falleth into the euill,
and reuerteth not backward, as some hold opinion. The
salt lake conteyneth fiftéene miles in breadth and fiftéene
in length, and more than fiue and fortie in circuite, and
the lake of swéete water conteyneth euen as muche, in
such sort, that the whole lake conteyneth more than thirtie
leagues, and hath about fiftie townes scituated round
about it, many of whyche Townes doe conteyne fiue
thousand housholdes, and some tenne thousande, yea and
one Towne called <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>, is as bigge as <em class="italic">Mexico</em>. Al this
lake of water springeth out of a Mountayne that standeth
within sight of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>. The cause that the one part
of the lake is brackishe or saltish, is, that the bottome or
ground is all salte, and of that water greate quantitie of
salt is dayly made.</p>

<p>In this greate lake are aboue two hundred thousande
little boates, which the <em class="italic">Indians</em> call <em class="italic">Acalles</em>,
and the <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em>
call them <em class="italic">Canoas</em>, according to the spéeche of <em class="italic">Cuba</em>
and <em class="italic">Santo Domingo</em>, wrought like a kneding trough: some
are bigger than other some, according to the greatenesse
of the body of y<sup>e</sup> trée whereof they are made. And where
I number two hūdred thousand of these boates, I speake
of the least, for <em class="italic">Mexico</em> alone hathe aboue fiftie thousande
ordinarily to carrie and bring vnto the Citie victuall,
prouision, and passengers, so that on the market day all y<sup>e</sup>
stréetes of water are full of them.</p>

The Market is called in the <em class="italic">Indian</em> tong <em class="italic">Tlanquiztli</em>:
euery parish hath his Market place to
buy and sel in: but <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and <em class="italic">Tlatelulco</em> only,
which are y<sup>e</sup> chiefest cities, haue great fayres
and places fitte for the same, and especiallye <em class="italic">Mexico</em> hath
one place where most dayes in the yeare is buying and
selling, but euery fourth day is the greate Market ordinaryly:
and the like custome is vsed throughout the dominions
of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>.</p>

<p>This place is wide and large, compassed round about
with dores, and is so great, that a hundered thousand persons
come thither to choppe and change, as a Cittie most
principall in all that region. Wherefore the resort is frō
farre parties vnto that place. Euery occupatiō and kinde
of Marchādise hath his proper place appointed, which no
other may by any means occupy or disturbe. Likewise pesterous
wares haue their place accordinglye, (that is to
say) stone, timber, lyme, bricke, and all kinde of stuffe vnwrought,
being necessarie to buylde withall. Also mattes
both fine and course of sundry workemanship, also coles,
woodde, and all sorts of Earthen vessell glazed and painted
very curiously: Deare skinnes both rawe and tanned
in haire and without haire, of many colours, for shoomakers,
for bucklers, Targets, Ierkins, and lyning of woodden
Corselets: also skinnes of other beastes and foule in
feathers ready dressed of all sortes, the colours and
straungnesse thereof was a thing to behold. The richest
Marchandise was salte, and mantels of Cotten wolle of
diuers colours, both great and small, some for beddes, others
for garments and clothing, other for Tapissarie to
hang houses, other cotten clothe for linnen breaches,
shirtes, table clothes, towels, napkins, and suche like
things.</p>

<p>There were also Mantels made of the leaues of the
trée called <em class="italic">Metl</em>, and of Palme trée, &#38; Connie heare, which
are wel estéemed, being very warm, but y<sup>e</sup> couerlets made
of feathers are the best: they sell thréede made of Connie
heare, péeces of linnen clothe made of cotten wolle, also
skaynes of thréede of all colours: also it is straunge to sée
the great store of poultrie that is brought to that market,
and although they eate the fleshe of the foule, yet the
feathers serue for clothing, mixyng one sorte with another.
There are of these foule so many sortes and seuerall
colours, that I can not number them: some wilde, some
tame, some water foule, and other some of rapine. All the
brauery of the market, is the place where golde and feathers
ioyntly wrought is solde, for any thyng that is in
request is there liuely wrought in golde and feathers and
gallant colours. The <em class="italic">Indians</em> are so expert and perfite in
this science, that they will worke or make a Butterflie,
any wilde beaste, trées, roses, floures, hearbes, rootes or any
other thyng so liuely, that it is a thyng maruelous to
behold. It hapneth many tymes that one of these workemen
in a whole day will eate nothyng, onely to place one
feather in his dew perfection, turnyng and tossing the feather
to the lighte of the Sunne, into the shade or darke
place, to sée where is his moste naturall perfection, and
till his worke be finished he will neyther eate nor drinke.
There are few nations of so muche fleame or sufferance.
The Arte or Science of Goldsmiths among them is the
moste curious, and very good workemanship engrauen
with toles made of flinte, or in moulde. They will caste a
platter in moulde with eight corners, and euery corner of
seuerall mettall, that is to say, the one of golde, and the other
of siluer, without any kinde of sowder: they will also
founde or cast a litle caudren with lose handles hangyng
thereat, as we vse to caste a Bell: they will also caste in
mould a fish of mettal with one scale of siluer on his back
and another of gold: they will make a Parret or Popingay
of mettall, that his tongue shall shake, and his head
moue, &#38; his wings flutter: they wil caste an Ape in mold,
that both hands &#38; féete shall stirre, &#38; holde a spindle in his
hande séeming to spinne, yea and an apple in his hande as
though he would eate it. Our Spaniardes were not a litle
amazed at the sight of these things, for our Goldsmithes
are not to be compared vnto them. They haue skil also of
Amell worke, and to sette any pretious stone. But now
as touchyng the markette, there is sell Golde, Siluer,
Copper, Leadde, Latton, and Tinne, although there is
but little of the thrée laste mettals mentioned. There are
Pearles, Pretious stones, diuers and sundry sortes of
Shelles, and Bones, Sponges, and other pedlers ware,
whiche certainely are many and straunge sortes, yea and
a thing to laughe at their Haberdashe toyes and trifles.
There are also many kinde of hearbes, rootes, and séedes,
as well to be eaten as for Medicine, for bothe men, wemen
and chyldren haue great knowledge in hearbes, for
through pouertie and necessitie, they séeke them for theyr
sustenaunce and helpe of theyr infirmities and diseases.
They spende little among Phisitions, although there are
some of that Arte, and many Poticaries, who doe bryng
into the markette, oyntments, Siroppes, waters, and
other drugges fitte for sicke Persons: they cure all diseases
almost, with hearbes, yea as muche as for to kill
lyse they haue a proper hearbe for the purpose.</p>

<p>The seuerall kyndes of meates to be solde is without
number, as Snakes without head &#38; tayle, little Dogges
gelte, Moules, Rattes, Long wormes, Lyse, yea and a
kinde of earth, for at one season in the yéere they haue
Nettes of mayle with the which they rake vp a certayne
duste that is bredde vpon the water of the lake of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,
and that is knéeded togither like vnto oas of the sea: they
gather much of this victuall, &#38; kéepe it in heapes, &#38; make
thereof cakes like vnto brickebats: they sell not only this
ware in y<sup>e</sup> market, but also send it abroad to other fayres
&#38; markets a far of: they eat this meate w<sup>t</sup> as good stomake
as we eate chéese, yea and they holde opinion that this
skume or fatnesse of the water, is y<sup>e</sup> cause that such great
number of foule cōmeth to the lake, which in the winter
season is infinite.</p>

<p>They sel in this market venison by quarters or whole,
as Does, Hares, Connies, and Dogges, and many other
beastes, which they bring vp for the purpose, and take in
huntyng. There are a great number of shoppes that sell
all kinde of orfall and tripes. It is a wonder to sée how so
much meate ready dressed coulde be spent. There is also
fleshe and fishe rosted, boyled and baked, Pies and Custardes
made of diuers sortes of egges, the great quantitie
of bread is without number. Also corne of all sortes
threshed and vnthreshed. The greate store of sundry
kyndes of fruytes is maruellous which are there solde,
bothe gréene and ripe: there is one sorte as bigge as Almondes
called <em class="italic">Cacao</em>, whiche is both meate and currant
money. There are diuers kind of colours to be solde, whiche
they make of Roses, floures, fruites, barkes of trées,
and other things very excellent: they sell there Honie of
sundry kindes, oyle of <em class="italic">Chian</em>, made of a séede like vnto mustarde
séede, and oynting any paynted clothe therewith,
the water can not hurte it, they also dresse therwith their
meate, although they haue both butter and larde. Theyr
sundry sortes of wines shalbe declared in an other place: it
woulde be a prolixious thing to rehearse all the things
that are to be solde in that markette. There are in this
fayre many Artificers, as Packers, Barbars, Cutlers, &#38;
may others, although it was thought that among these
<em class="italic">Indians</em> were none such. All the things recited, and many
others which I speake not of, are solde in euery market of
<em class="italic">Mexico</em>, all the sellers paye a certaine summe for theyr
shops or stādings to the King, as a custome, &#38; they to be
preserued and defended from théeues: and for that cause
there goe certayne Sergeants or officers vp &#38; downe the
market to espie out malefactours. In the middest of the
market standeth a house whiche may be séene throughout
the fayre, &#38; there sitteth twelue auncient men for iudges
to dispatch lawe matters: their buying and selling is to
chaunge one ware for another, as thus, one giueth a hen
for a bundell of <em class="italic">Maiz</em>, other giue mantels for salte, or money
whiche is <em class="italic">Cacao</em>, and this is theyr order to choppe and
chaunge: they haue measure and strike for all kynde of
corne, and other earthen measures for Hony and Wine,
and if any measure be falsified, they punish the offenders
and breake their measures.</p>

<h2 id="chap74">The great Temple of Mexico.</h2>

<div class="toclink"><a href="#tableofcontents">TOC</a></div>

<p class="drop-cap">
<img class="drop-cap isize5" src="images/i209.jpg" width="190" height="188" alt="" />
The Temple is called <em class="italic">Teucalli</em>, that is to say,
Gods house, <em class="italic">Teutl</em> signifieth God, &#38; <em class="italic">Calli</em> is a
house, a vowell very fitte, if that house had
bene of the true God. The Spaniards that
vnderstād not the language, do pronounce
and call those Temples <em class="italic">Cues</em>, and the God <em class="italic">Vitzilopuchtli</em>,
<em class="italic">Vchilobos</em>. There are in <em class="italic">Mexico</em> many parishe churches,
with towres, wherein are chappels and Altares where
the images &#38; idols do stande, &#38; those chappels do serue for
burial places of their founders, and the Parishioners are
buried in the Churchyarde. All their tēples are of one fashion,
therefore it shal be nowe sufficient to speake of the
cathedral church. And euen as those tēples are al in generall
of one making in that citie. I doe beleue that the lyke
was neuer séene nor heard off. This temple is square, &#38;
doth containe euery way as much ground as a crossebow
can reach leuell: it is made of stone, with foure dores that
abutteth vpon the thrée calseys, and vpon an other parte
of the Cittie, that hath no calsey but a fayre streate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A straunge dore.</div>

<p>In the middest of this Quadern standeth a mount of
earth and stone square lykewise, and fiftie fadom long euery
way, buylte vpward like vnto a pyramide of Egipt,
sauyng the toppe is not sharpe, but playne and flatte, and
tenne fadom square: vppon the weast side, were steppes
vp to the toppe, in number an hundreth and fourtene,
whiche beyng so many, high, and made of good stone dyd
séeme a beautifull thing. It was a straunge sight to beholde
the Priestes, some goyng vp, and some downe with
ceremonies, or with men to be sacrificed. Vpon the toppe
of this Temple are two great Alters, a good space distant
the one from the other, and so nigh the edge or brimme of
the wall, that scarcely a man mought go behind them at
pleasure. The one Alter standeth on the right hande, &#38; the
other on the left, they were but of fiue foote highe, eche of
them had the backe part made of stone, paynted with mōstrous
and foule figures, the Chappell was fayre &#38; well
wrought of Masons worke &#38; timber, euery Chappell had
thrée loftes one aboue another, susteyned vpon pillers, &#38;
with y<sup>e</sup> height thereof it shewed like vnto a fayre tower,
and beautified the Cittie a farre of: from thence a man
mought sée all the cittie and townes rounde aboute the
lake, whiche was vndoubtedly a goodly prospect. And bycause
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> &#38; his company shoulde sée the beautie therof,
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> brought him thither, and shewed hym all the
order of the Temple, euen from the foote to the toppe.
There was a certaine plot of space for the idoll priests to
celebrate their seruice without disturbance of any. Their
general prayers were made toward y<sup>e</sup> rising of the sunne.
Vpon ech alter standeth a great idoll. Beside this tower
that standeth vpō the pyramide, there are fourtie towers
great &#38; small belonging to other little tēples which stand
in the same circuite, the which although they were of the
same making, yet theyr prospect was not westwarde, but
otherwayes, bicause there should be a difference betwixte
the great temple &#38; them. Some of these Temples were
bigger than others, and euery one of a seuerall God, among
the whiche there was one rounde temple dedicated
to the God of the ayre called <em class="italic">Quecalcouatl</em>, for euen as the
ayre goeth rounde aboute the heauens, euen for that consideration
they made his temple rounde. The entraunce of
that Temple had a dore made lyke vnto the mouth of a
Serpent, and was paynted with foule and Diuelish gestures,
with great téeth &#38; gummes wrought, whiche was
a thing to feare those that should enter in thereat, &#38; especially
the Christians vnto whom it represented very Hel
with that ougly face and monsterous téeth.</p>

<p>There were other <em class="italic">Teucalles</em> in the citie, that had the ascending
vp by steps in thrée places: all these temples had
houses by thēselues with all seruice &#38; priests &#38; particular
Gods. At euery dore of the great temple standeth a large
Hall &#38; goodly lodgings, both high and lowe round about,
which houses were cōmon armouries for the Citie, for the
force and strength of euery towne is the temple, and therfore
they haue there placed their storehouse of munition.
They had other darke houses full of idols, greate &#38; small,
wrought of sundry mettals, they are all bathed and washed
with bloud, and do shewe very blacke through theyr
dayly sprinklyng and anoynting thē with the same, when
any man is sacrificed: yea &#38; the walles are an inche thicke
with bloud, and the grounde is a foote thicke of bloud, so
that there is a diuelish stench. The Priests or Ministers
goe daylye into those Oratories, and suffer none others
but great personages to enter in. Yea and when any
such goeth in, they are bounde to offer some man to be sacrificed,
that those bloudy hangmen and ministers of the
Diuell may washe their handes in bloud of those so sacrificed,
and to sprinkle their house therewith.</p>

<p>For their seruice in the kitchin they haue a ponde of water
that is filled once a yéere, which is brought by conduct
from the pryncipal fountayne. All the residue of the foresayde
circuite serueth for places to bréede foule, with gardens
of hearbes and swéete trees, with Roses and floures
for the Altars. Such, so great &#38; straunge was this temple
of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, for the seruice of the Diuell who had deceiued
those simple <em class="italic">Indians</em>. There dothe reside in the same
temple continually fiue thousand persons, and all they are
lodged and haue theyr liuing there, for that tēple is maruellous
riche, &#38; hath diuers townes onely for their maintenaunce
and reparation, and are bounde to sustayne the
same alwayes on foote. They doe sowe corne, and maintayne
all those fiue thousande persons with bread, fruyte,
flesh, fishe, and firewoodde as much as they néede, for they
spende more fire woodde than is spent in the kings courte:
these persons doe liue at their hartes ease, as seruauntes
and vassals vnto the Goddes. <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> brought <em class="italic">Cortes</em> to
this temple, bicause his men shoulde sée the same, and to
enforme them of his religion and holinesse, wherof I will
speake in an other place, being the most straunge and cruellest

The Gods of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, were two thousand
in number, as the <em class="italic">Indians</em> reported, the
chiefest were <em class="italic">Vitcilopuchtli</em> and <em class="italic">Tezcatlipuca</em>,
whose images stoode highest in the
Temple vppon the Altars: they were
made of stone in ful proportion as bigge
as a Gyant. They were couered with a lawne called
<em class="italic">Nacar</em>. These images were besette with pearles, precious
stones, &#38; péeces of gold, wrought like birds, beasts, fishes,
and floures, adorned with Emeralds, Turquies, Calcedons,
and other little fine stones, so that when the lawne
<em class="italic">Nacar</em> was taken away, the Images séemed very beautifull
to beholde.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A vvicked attire.</div>

<p>The Image had for a girdle great snakes of gold, and
for collors or chaynes about their neckes, ten hartes of
men, made of golde, and each of those Idolles had a counterfaite
visor with eies of glasse, and in their necks death
painted: eache of these things hadde their considerations
and meanings. These two Goddes were brethren, for
<em class="italic">Tezcatlipuca</em> was the God of Prouidence, and <em class="italic">Vitcilopuchtli</em>
God of the warres, who was worshipped and
feared more than all the rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A madde offering.</div>

<p>There was another God, who hadde a greate Image
placed vppon the toppe of the Chappell of Idols, and hée
was estéemed for a speciall and singular God aboue all
the rest. This God was made of all kinde of séedes that
groweth in that Countrey, and being ground, they made
a certayne past, tempered with childrens bloud, and Virgins
sacrifised, who were opened with their razures in
the breastes, and their heartes taken out, to offer as first
fruites vnto the Idoll. The Priestes and Ministers doe
consecrate this Idoll with great pomp and many Ceremonies.
All the <em class="italic">Comarcans</em> and Citizens are presente at
the consecration, with great triumph and incredible deuotion.
After the consecration, many devoute persons
came and sticked in the dowy Image precious stones,
wedges of golde, and other Iewels. After all this pomp
ended, no secular man mought touche that holye Image,
no nor yet come into his Chappell, nay scarcely religious
persons, except they were <em class="italic">Tlamacaztli</em>, who are Priestes
of order. They doe renue this Image many times wyth
new dough, taking away the olde, but then blessed is hée
that can get one péece of the olde ragges for relikes, and
chiefly for souldyers, who thought themselues sure therwith
in the warres. Also at the consecration of thys Idoll,
a certayne vessell of water was blessed with manye
wordes and ceremonyes, and that water was preserued
very religiously at the foote of the altar, for to consecrate
the King when he should be crowned, and also to blesse any
Captayne generall, when he shoulde be elected for the
warres, with only giuing him a draught of that water.</p>

Without the temple, and ouer againste the

standeth the Charnell house onely
of dead mens heads prisoners in warres
and sacrifised with the knife.</p>

<p>This monument was made like vnto
a Theatre, more larger than broade, wrought of lyme
and stone, with ascending steppes, in the walles whereof
was graffed betwixt stone and stone a skul with the téeth
outwards.</p>

<p>At the foote and head of this Theatre, were two Towers,
made only of lime and skulles, the téeth outwarde,
and this wall hauing no other stuffe, séemed a straunge
sight. At and vppon the toppe of the Theatre, were 70.
polles, standing the one from the other foure or fiue foote
distant, and eache of them was full of staues from the
foote to the toppe. Each of these staues had others made
fast vnto them, so that euery of them had fiue skulles broched
through the temples. <em class="italic">Andrewe de Tapia</em> did certifie
me, that he and <em class="italic">Gonsalo de Vmbria</em> dyd recken them in
one daye, and founde a hundred thirtie and sixe thousande
skulles on the polles, staues, and steppes. The other Towers
were replenished out of number, a most cruell custome,
being only mens heads slaine in sacrifice, although
it hath a shewe of humanitie for the remembrance there
placed of death. There are also men appoynted, that

<em class="italic">Hernando Cortez</em> and his companye, were sixe
dayes in beholding and perusing the scituation
of the Citie, and secretes of the same, with
the notable thinges before rehearsed: they
were often visited by <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, &#38; the Gentlemen of hys
Courte, and abundantly prouided of things necessarye
for his vse, and the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of his company.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A svveete bedde.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Determination of Cortez.</div>

<p>Likewise his Horses were cherished and serued with
gréene barley and grasse, whereof there is plentie all the
yeare: Likewise of corne, meale, roses, and of all thynges
that their owners would request, in so much that beddes
of floures were made for them in place of litter. But yet
notwithstanding, although they were in this sorte cherished,
and also lodged in so riche a Countrey, where they
mighte fyll their purses, they were not yet all contente
and merrie, but rather with great feare and care, especially
<em class="italic">Cortes</em>, who hadde the onely care as head and chiefe
Captayne for the defence of hys fellowes, hée (I saye)
was pensiue, noting the scituation of the Citie, the infinite
number of people, the state and maiestie of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,
yea and some disquietnesse of hys owne companye,
who woulde come and laye vnto hys charge the
snare and nette that they were in, thynkyng it a
thyng vnpossible that anye of them coulde escape,
if <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> were therevnto determined, or else with the
least muteny in the worlde, that mought be raysed in the
Citie, although that euery inhabitant shoulde throw but
one stone at them, or else to breake vp the drawbridges,
or withdrawing their victuals, things verye easie to bée
done. With this greate care that he had of the preseruation
of his fellowes, and to remedie the perill and
daunger that he stoode in, he determined to apprehēd <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
and to builde foure Foystes to haue the lake in
subiection, which he hadde tofore ymagined, and without
the apprehension of the King, he coulde not come by the
Kingdome: he would very gladly haue buylt the Foystes
out of hand, but he left off that pretence, only bycause he
would not delay the emprisonment of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, wherein
consisted the effect of all his businesse, so that forthwith
he minded to put in execution his intent, without gyuing
any of his company to vnderstand thereof.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Treasory of Mutezuma.</div>

<p>The quarrell wherewith he had armed himselfe for
that purpose, was, that the Lorde <em class="italic">Qualpopoca</em> hadde slayne
nine <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em>: likewise encouraged him the greate presumption
of his letters written to the Emperour <em class="italic">Charles</em>
his king, wherein he wrote that he would take <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
prisoner, and dispossesse him of his Empyre. These
causes considered, he tooke the letters of <em class="italic">Pedro Hircio</em>,
wherein was written, how <em class="italic">Qualpopoca</em> was the cause of
the death of nine <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em>, and put those letters into his
pocket, and walking vp and downe his lodging, tossyng
too and fro these ymaginations in his brayne, full of care
of the great enterprise that he had in hande, yea he hymselfe
iudging the matter doubtfull, and his head béeyng
in this sort occupyed, he chanced to espye one wall more
whiter than the rest, and beholding the same, he sawe
that it was a dore lately dammed vp, &#38; callyng vnto him
two of his seruaunts (for all the residue were asléepe)
bycause it was late in the nighte, he opened that dore, and
went in, and there found sundry halles, some with Idols,
some with gallant feathers, Iewels, precious stones,
plate, yea and such an infinite quantitie of golde, that the
sight thereof amazed him, and other gallant things that
made him to maruell. He shutte thys dore agayne as
well as he moughte, withoute touching any part of that
treasure, bycause he woulde not make any vprore therabout,
nor yet to delay the emprisonment of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
for that treasure was alwayes there to be had.</p>

<p>The nexte daye in the morning came certayne <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em>
vnto hym, and manye <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallon</em>, saying
that the Citizens did goe about to conspire their deathe,
and to breake downe the bridges of the calseys, to bryng
their purpose the better to passe. So that with this
newes, béeyng true or false, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> left the one halfe of his
men to defende and kéepe his lodging, and at euery crosse
stréete he planted mē, and the residue he sent to the Court
by two and two, and thrée and thrée, and he hymselfe
came to the pallaice, saying that he must talke wyth
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> of matters that did emport their liues. <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
was secretely armed. <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> hearyng howe <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
attended for hym, came forth and receyued him, taking
him by the hand, and placed him in his seate. Thirtie <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em>
wayted vpon <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, and the residue abode without
at the dore.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> saluted <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> according to his accustomed
manner, and began to rest and talke merily as hée was
wont to do. <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> béeyng carelesse of the thing that
Fortune hadde prepared agaynste hym, was also very
merrie, and pleased with that conuersation. He gaue
vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em> Iewels of golde, and one of his daughters,
and other noble mens daughters to others of his company.
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> receyued the gift, for otherwise it hadde bin
a frent vnto <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>. But yet he enformed him, that
he was a married man, and that he coulde not marrie
with his daughter, for the Christian law did not permitte
the same, nor yet that any Christian mought haue more
than one wife, vppon payne of infamy, and to be marked
in the forehead.</p>

<p>After all this talke ended, <em class="italic">Cortez</em> tooke the letters of
<em class="italic">Pedro Hircio</em>, and caused them to be interpreted vnto <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
makyng hys grieuous complaynte agaynste
<em class="italic">Qualpopoca</em>, who hadde slayne so many <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em> through
hys commaundement, yea and that his subiectes had published,
that they woulde kill the <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em>, and breake
downe the bridges.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> excused himselfe earnestly, as well of the
one as of the other, saying, the report giuen out agaynste
hys subiectes was false and vntrue, and as for <em class="italic">Qualpopoca</em>
who had slayne the <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em>, he was innocent thereof:
and bycause that he shoulde sée the troth, he called incontinent
certayne of his seruauntes, commaunding thē
to goe for <em class="italic">Qualpopoca</em>, and gaue vnto them his seale, whiche
was a stone that he ware at his wrest, engraued with
the figure of the God <em class="italic">Vitzilopuchtli</em>, and the messengers
departed therewith incontinent.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> replyed and sayd: My Lord, your highnesse must
goe with me to my lodging, and there abide, vntill youre
messengers returne with <em class="italic">Qualpopoca</em>, and the certaynetie
of the deathe of my men: In my lodging youre highnesse
shall rule and commaund as you do héere in Court, your
person shall bée well vsed, wherefore take you no care,
for I will haue respecte vnto youre honor, as to myne
owne proper, or the honor of my Kyng, beséeching you to
pardon me in this my request, for if I shoulde doe otherwise,
and dissemble with you, mine own company would
be offended with me, saying that I doe not defende them,
according to duetie. Wherefore commaund your householde
seruauntes to repose themselues without alteration,
for be you assured, that if any hurte come vnto me, or
vnto anye of mine, youre person shall pay the same with
life, considering that it lyeth in youre hand to goe quietly
with me.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> was sore amazed, saying, Sir, my person is
not fytte to be a prisoner, yea, and though I woulde permitte
the same, my subiectes would not suffer.</p>

<p>They abode arguing the matter néere foure houres,
and at length <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> was content to goe, hauing promise
that he should rule and gouerne as he was wont to
do. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> cōmaunded a place in his lodging to be trimmed
for him, and he went forthwith thither with <em class="italic">Cortes</em>.
There came many noble men barefooted, wéeping and
lamenting the case, carrying their best garmentes vnder
their armes, and brought a rich seate, whereon <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
was placed, &#38; they carried hym vpon their shoulders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A sorovvful pastime.</div>

<p>When it was blowen abroade in the Citie that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
was carried prisoner to the <em class="italic">Spanyards</em> lodging, all
the Citie was on an vprore: but yet <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> did comfort
the Gentlemen that carried and followed him wéeping,
praying them to ceasse their lamentation, saying
that he was not prisoner, nor yet went with the Chrystians
againste his will, but for his onely pleasure. <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
appointed a <em class="italic">Spanish</em> garde for him, with a Captayne, the
which he dayly changed, and had <em class="italic">Spanyards</em> always in his
cōpany to make him pastime. Also poore <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> was
cōtented with their conuersation, &#38; gaue thē stil rewards.
He was serued with his owne seruāts <em class="italic">Indiās</em>, as at home
in his pallace. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> always intreated him to put off sadnes,
&#38; to be merrie, permitting him to dispatch suters, &#38; to
deale in all affayres of his estate, &#38; to comune and talke
openly or secretely with his noble mē as he was wont to
do, and that was but onely a bayte to bring them to the
hooke. There was neuer Greeke nor Romayne, nor any
other nation since the name of Kings was ordeyned, dyd
gyue y<sup>e</sup> lyke enterprise, as <em class="italic">Hernando Cortez</em> did, in taking
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> prisoner in his owne house, béeing a most
mighty King, &#38; in a most strong fort among infinite people,
he hauyng but only 450. companions.</p>

<em class="italic">Mvtezuma</em> had not only al the libertie that
he desired in the Citie, béeyng prisoner among
the <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em>, but also <em class="italic">Cortes</em> permitted
him to hunt and hauke, or to go to
the temple, for he was very deuoute, and
a great hunter.</p>

<p>When he went a hunting, he was carried vpon mens
shoulders with eyght or ten <em class="italic">Spanyards</em> in his guard, and
thrée thousande <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>, who were Gentlemen, his seruants,
and hunters, of whome he hadde a great number,
some to séeke the game, others to beate the couertes, and
others to marke. Some of those Hunters were only for
hares and connyes, other for all sorts of Déere, Wolues,
foxes, and such like. They were very perfite with theyr
bowes, and good markemē, for he that missed his marke
at fourescore pases distant was punished. It was strange
to sée the number of people that wente with him on hunting,
and to sée the slaughter of beasts killed, with hande,
staues, nettes, and bowes, some of those beastes were
tame, and other braue and fearefull, as Lyons, Tigers,
and Ounces. It is a harde thing to take a fierce Lion in
hunting as they do, being in manner a naked people, and
the beast couragious and strong, but yet the Prouerbe
saith, slight and cunning is better than strength.</p>

<p>It is a more straunge thyng to take any foule that
flieth in the ayre as their Fauconers doe, for after they
haue once marked and set eye vpon any foule, the Faulconers
of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> will vnder take to catch him, although
the foule be neuer so swifte of wing, beyng at the
least so commaunded by the King. It happened one day
that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> stoode in his gallerie with his Guarde of
Spanyardes, who had espied a fayre Hauke soryng in the
ayre, oh quoth they what a fayre Hauke flieth yonder,
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> hearyng their talke, called vnto him certayne
of his Faulconers, commaundyng them to followe that
Hauke &#38; to bring him vnto him. The Faulconers wente
to fulfill his request, and followed that foule with such diligence,
that in shorte space they brought the Hauke vnto
him, who presented the same vnto the Spanyards, a thing
truely almoste incredible, but yet certified by worde and
wrytings of the present witnesses. Their chiefest and
most pleasant pastime of Hauking was, of Kightes, Rauens,
Crowes, Pies, and other birdes of hardie stomake
and slowe in flight, greate and small of all sortes, for the
which he had Egles, Buyters, and other foule of rapyne
marueylous swifte of wing, and suche as would mounte
very high in the ayre, with the whiche they murdered
Hares, Wolues, and (as some say) Hartes.</p>

<p>He had other foulers, that vsed Nettes, Snares, and
sundry engins. <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> vsed much to shoote in a tronke,
and with his bow killed many wilde beastes. His houses
of pleasure as I haue before declared, stoode sixe myles
from the Citie in pleasant wooddes: and alwayes when
he went a huntyng after the tyme that he was prysoner,
the same day he would returne agayne to <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his lodging,
although he banketed &#38; feasted with the Spaniardes
at his places of sporting and pastime, and would alwayes
at his returne to his lodgyng giue some present vnto thē,
that had accompanied him that day.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> seyng the liberalitie of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, sayde vnto
him: sir, my company are vnruly fellowes, and as I vnderstand,
they haue founde out some of your treasure, and
haue made spoyle thereof: wherfore I would know your
pleasure what shal be done with thē. And in effect it was
the treasure that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> himselfe had founde out. <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
answered, saying, sir that treasure which they haue
founde, did appertayne vnto the Goddes: But yet notwithstandyng,
let them leaue the feathers, and all suche
things as are neyther golde nor siluer, and all the residue
take for you and them, and if you will haue more, I will
prouide it for you.</p>

went leaning vpon a noble mans arme,
or else was leade betwéene two, and a noble
personage wente alwayes before him
with thrée small wandes in his hande, signifying
thereby that the King in person
was there at hand, and in token also of iustice and correction.
If he had bene carried vpon mens shoulders then at
his alighting downe he tooke one of those roddes into his
owne hand. He was a Prince ful of ceremonies in al his
doings, but the substaunce of his estate is already declared,
from the time that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> entred into <em class="italic">Mexico</em> vntil this
present. Those first dayes that the Spaniardes came to
the Citie, &#38; as often as <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> went to the temple, <em class="italic">Indian</em>
men were slayne in sacrifice. And to prohibite suche
adhominable crueltie &#38; sinne, cōmitted in the presence of
the Christians who wēt in company of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
required <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> to commmaunde that no mans fleshe
should be any more spoyled, or bloud shedde in sacrifice,
and in not fulfilling his request, he would destroy bothe
the temple and Cittie. Also he signified vnto him, that he
himselfe woulde throw downe the idols, before his presence
and all the Citizens.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> replied to his demaūd, saying: It may please
you to leaue of your determination, least that in so doing
all the Citie fall into an vprore and rebellion to defende
their good Gods, and auncient Religion, the which Gods
had alwayes prouided them of water, bread, health, light,
and all other things néedefull. This notwithstanding, the
first time that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> wente to the temple after his
imprisonment, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> and his company wente with him,
and euery of them layde handes vpon the idols, &#38; threwe
them downe headlong from their seates, and Altars, and
other Chapels. <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> with this sight was in great
agonie, yea and his subiects ready to take weapon to slay
them there present, but yet <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> commaunded his
subiectes to stay from their pretence: beséechyng <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
to stay from his procéedings, at whose request <em class="italic">Cortes</em> ceased,

as yée shal vnderstande, that is body, soule, and goodes: as
for your goodes and ritches, whiche is the least that wée
desire, for yée know well that we haue taken nothing forcible
from you, but onely those things whiche yée haue
fréely and liberally giuen vs. Likewise we haue not hurt,
misused or molested your persons, wiues or chyldren, nor
yet do meane any such thing, your soules health onely is
the thing we séeke, for your saluation, and that we nowe
pretende to shewe, and to giue vnto you perfite notice of
the true and euerlasting God. There is none of naturall
iudgement can denie, but that there is one God, but yet
through ignoraunce and deceyte of the Diuell, will also
thinke that there are many Goddes, and not acerte vnto
the true God. But I doe say and moste assuredly certifie
you, that there is no other true God, but onely he whome
we Christians doe serue, adore, and worshippe, the which
is one eternall, without beginnyng and without ende,
the onely creator &#38; gouernour of things created: he alone
made the Heauens, the Sunne, the Moone, and Starres,
the whiche his creatures ye doe worship: he (I say) founded
and made the Sea, and the sundry and maruelous fishes
therein: he planted and made the lande with all the
monstrous beastes therein, foules likewise in the ayre,
Plantes, Hearbes, Stones and suche like. Al the whiche
creatures ye as blinde and ignorant do hold for Goddes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">It vvas maruel that Cortes vvas not taken for an heretike.</div>

<p>Our almighty God after he had finished and made all
the former workes with his own blessed hands, made one
man &#38; one woman, and being so formed and wrought, he
put a soule and breath into each body, and then deliuered
the worlde vnto them, shewyng them Paradise and glory.
So that of that manne and woman, we all mortall
menne procéeded in generation, and in this sorte are
the handy worke of God, kinsmen and brethren. Nowe
if we will come vnto God our father, it is néedefull and
necessary that we be good, vertuous, pitifull, innocent and
vnder obedience, the whiche yée can not be if you worshippe
statues, images, idols, and vse bloudy sacrifice of
mans fleshe. Is there any of you that woulde willingly
be slayne? no truely: why then doe you slea other so cruelly,
and where you can put no soules, why doe you take
them from thence? there is none of you, nor your false
Gods, that can make soules, nor can forge mens bodies
of fleshe and bone, for if yée coulde, there is none of you
woulde be without children, accordyng to your owne appetite
and desire, in fashion, beautie and workemanship.
But where our God of heauen dothe make al creatures,
he vseth therein his owne discretion, and giueth chyldren
to whome hée pleaseth: and therefore is he GOD
alone, and for these causes shoulde yée haue, estéeme, and
worshippe him for suche a mightie God, desiryng of him
by prayers to giue rayne and temperature, that the earth
may bryng foorth Corne, Fruite, Hearbes, Fleshe, Foule,
and all other necessaries for the sustentation of lyfe. All
these thyngs the harde stones giueth not vnto you, no nor
yet your dry woodden images &#38; colde mettall, neyther yet
the small séedes wherewith your seruaunts and slaues,
with theyr filthy handes doe make these images and
foule statues, the whiche yée doe worshippe. O what
fonde people and madde religious persons, who worship
theyr owne workemanshippe, doe ye thynke that they
are Gods that rotte and moldre away, and haue no lyfe,
and can neyther helpe nor kill: Therefore I say vnto
you, that nowe and hereafter there is no cause that yée
shoulde haue any moe idolles, nor yet any moe slaughters
for sacrifice, no nor yet to make any moe prayers
or supplications vnto them, beyng bothe Blinde, Deafe,
and Dumme.</p>

<p>Will yée knowe who is God, and where he is: lifte
vp your eyes vnto Heauen, and then shall you vnderstande
that aboue is a Godhead or Deitie that moueth
the heauens, and gouerneth the course of the Sunne, ruleth
the Lande and replenisheth the Sea, who prouideth
for Man and Beast bothe Corne and Water. This God
whome yée nowe imagine in your hartes, him (I say)
serue and worshippe, not with death of menne or blouddy
sacrifice abominable, but with deuotion and humble
prayer as we Christians doe. And consider well, that to
teach and instruct you these things, was the cause of our
commyng hither.</p>

<p>With this exhortation, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> aplaked the yre of the
Priestes and Citizens: theyr idols beyng throwen downe,
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> tooke order that no moe shoulde be sette vp,
commaundyng to swéepe and make cleane the Chappels
of the stinking bloud that was in thē, forbidding sacrifice
of mans flesh. <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> and his officers made a solēpne
vowe and promise to permitte no more slaughter of men,
and to set vp a Crosse for remembrance of the death and
passion of Iesu Christe borne of the virgin Marie. The
whiche their promisse was well fulfilled, for after that
day the Spanyardes coulde neuer heare nor finde of any
moe sacrifice: But yet there abode in their hartes a mortall
rancor, the whiche coulde not long be dissimuled.</p>

<p>Truely in this worthy facte <em class="italic">Cortes</em> gotte more honour

After twentie dayes that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> had
bene prysoner, returned the messengers
who had gone with the seale for <em class="italic">Qualpopoca</em>,
and brought him, his Sonne, and other
fiftene principall persons, with them, the
whiche by inquirie made, were culpable and partakers
in the counsell and death of the nine Spaniardes. <em class="italic">Qualpopoca</em>
entred into <em class="italic">Mexico</em> accompanied like a greate Lorde
as he was, beyng borne vpon his seruaunts shoulders in
rich furniture. As sone as he had saluted <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, he &#38;
his Sonne were deliuered vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, with the other fiftene
Gentlemen. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> placed them asunder, and commaunded
them to be put in Irons, and theyr examinations
taken, they confessed that they had slayne those Spaniardes
in battayle.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> demaunded of <em class="italic">Qualpopoca</em> if he were subiect to
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, why (quoth he) is there any other Prince to
whome I might be in subiection? giuing almost to vnderstand
that he was a Lorde absolute. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> answered, that
a farre greater Prince was the King of Spayne, whose
subiects vnder colour of friendship and salfeconduct he
had slayne. But (quoth he) nowe shalte thou make payment
thereof. And beyng agayne more straighter examined,
they confessed that they had slaine two Spaniards
by the aduice and inducement of the greate prince <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
and the residue were slayne in the warres, and had
assaulted their houses, and entred their countrey, wherefore
they helde it lawfull to kill them.</p>

<p>Through the confession pronounced by their owne
mouthes, sentence was giuen against them, and they condēned
to be burned, whiche sentence was openly executed
in the market place in sight of all the people, without any
mutine or slaunder, and with great silence, terrour &#38; feare
of the newe maner of iustice which they sawe there executed
vpon so noble a man, in the chiefe seate and kyngdome

At the time that Cortes departed from <em class="italic">Vera

to procure to inhabite in that place
which is called <em class="italic">Almeria</em>, &#38; not to permit
<em class="italic">Francisco de Garray</em> to soiourne there, for
so much as once he was driuen frō that
coast. Now <em class="italic">Hircio</em> to fulfill his cōmission, sente to requyre
those <em class="italic">Indians</em> with peace and friēdship, and to yéeld themselues
for vassals of the Emperour. <em class="italic">Qualpopoca</em> Lorde of
<em class="italic">Nahutlan</em>, which is now called as aforesaid <em class="italic">Almeria</em>, sent
to aduertise <em class="italic">Pedro Hircio</em>, that he could not come to yéelde
his obedience, for the enimies that were in the way: but if
it would please him to sende some of his men, for the securitie
of the way, he would willyngly come vnto him.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Hircio</em> hearing this answere, sent foure of his men, giuing
credite to his message, and for the desire he hadde to inhabite
there.</p>

<p>When the foure <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em> came into the prouince of
<em class="italic">Nahutlan</em>, there mette with them many armed men, who
slew two of them, and made thereof a great triumph: the

newes to the Towne of <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em>. <em class="italic">Pedro Hircio</em> beléeuing
that <em class="italic">Qualpopoca</em> had done that iniurie, armed out agaynst

with two horses, and two péeces of Ordinance.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Qualpopoca</em> hearing this newes, came with a mightie
power to driue them out of his Countrey, and in that encounter,
seauen <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em> were slayne, and many <em class="italic">Zempoallanezes</em>,
but at the ende he was ouercome, his Countrey
spoyled, and Towne sacked, and many of his army slaine

the commaundement of the greate Lorde <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, all
this vprore was attempted by <em class="italic">Qualpopoca</em>: it mighte well
be, for at the houre of death they confessed the same. But
some affirme, they sayde so, but to excuse themselues, and

Before the execution of <em class="italic">Qualpopoca</em> and hys
fellowes, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> declared vnto <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
that <em class="italic">Qualpopoca</em> and his company had confessed,
that by hys aduice and commaundemente,
the nine <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em> were slayne,
wherein he had done very euill, they being his friendes
and guestes: but (quoth he) if it were not in respect of the
loue I beare vnto you, this matter shoulde not in this
sort be shut vp, and then knocked a payre of giues on his
legges, saying, he that killeth ought to be killed, according
to the lawes of God. These things did <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, bycause
he shoulde occupye himselfe in his owne griefe and sorrow,
and to let other mens passe.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> waxed pale w<sup>t</sup> countenāce of death, through
the great feare that he was in, séeyng himselfe in Irons,
a new and strange thing for suche a great King, excusing
himselfe that he was innocent of the facte. And as soone
as the execution of burning was done, <em class="italic">Cortez</em> commaunded
to put away the Irons that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> ware, offering
him libertie, and willing him to goe vnto his owne pallace,
who reioyced much to sée himselfe out of the Irons,
and gaue <em class="italic">Cortes</em> most hartie thankes, and refused to goe
home to his owne pallace, surmising that the offer was
but wordes, or else fearing least his subiects woulde kyll
him, séeing him out of the <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em> power, for permitting
himselfe to be taken prisoner, and so to be kept. Hée
sayd also, that if he went from them, his subiectes woulde
rebell, and compell him to kill the <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em>.</p>

<p>Truly the poore simple soule was of small hearte and
courage, to suffer himselfe to be taken prisoner, and after
his imprisonment woulde neuer procure libertie, <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
offering it vnto him, and many of his noble men desiring
him. And remayning in that order, there was none in
<em class="italic">Mexico</em> durst offende any <em class="italic">Spanyard</em> for feare of displeasing
him, for <em class="italic">Qualpopoca</em> came 70. leagues with only warning
him that the great Lorde had sent for him, shewing hym
the figure of his seale: yea and al the péeres of his realme
that dwelte farthest off, were ready to obey hys commaundementes.</p>

<em class="italic">Cortez</em> had a greate desire to know howe farre
the Empire of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> dyd extende, and
what friendship was betwixte him and other
Kings and Princes Comarcans, and also to
gather togither a good summe of gold, to send to <em class="italic">Spayne</em> to
the Emperoure for his custome or fifte parte, with full
relation of the Countrey people, and things happened
untill that day. Wherefore he prayed <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> to shew
him where the mynes were, from whence he and his subiectes
had the golde and plate. <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> graunted to his
request, and incontinent appoynted eyght <em class="italic">Indians</em>, of the
which four were Goldsmythes, who had knowledge and
vnderstanding of Mynes, and the other foure were
guydes for the iourney. He commaunded them that by
two and two they shoulde goe into foure prouinces, that
is to say <em class="italic">Zucolla</em>, <em class="italic">Malinaltepec</em>, <em class="italic">Tenich</em>, and <em class="italic">Tutepec</em>, with other
eyghte <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em> whiche <em class="italic">Cortez</em> appoynted, to haue
knowledge of the riuers and mynes of gold, and to bring
a moster of the same. The eyght <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em> departed
on their iourney, with the other eyghte <em class="italic">Indians</em>, with tokens
from <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>. <em class="italic">Zucolla</em> is 80. leagues from <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,
and the Lord thereof is subiect to <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, who shewed
vnto the <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em> thrée riuers with golde, and gaue of
each riuer a moster thereof, although it were but little,
for with want of knowledge they knew not wel the māner
how to get it out of the riuer. These messengers in
their iourney too and fro, passed through thrée prouinces
full of people and habitatiō, with good buildings &#38; frutefull
ground, and the people of the one of them called <em class="italic">Tlamacolapan</em>,
are of good reason and iudgemente, and better
apparelled than the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Malinaltepec</em> is 70. leagues from <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, from whence
also they brought mosters of golde, the which is had out
of a great riuer, by the naturals of that Countrey.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Tenich</em> standeth vp towarde the head of the same riuer
of <em class="italic">Malinaltepec</em>, who are people of another language,
and would not permitte our men to haue relation of the
thing that they sought. The Lorde of that place is called
<em class="italic">Coatelicamatl</em>, who is not subiecte to <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, nor yet is
his friende, thinking that his men hadde bin espyes: but
when he was enformed who they were, he gaue the <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em>
licence to be resolued of their affayres, but straitly
commaunded, that the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Mexico</em> should not presume
to come into his dominion. When the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>
hearde these newes, they required the <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em> not to
credite that <em class="italic">Cazike</em>, saying, that he was an euill and a
cruell man, and would surely kill them. Our men were
somewhat amazed, fearing to talke with <em class="italic">Coatelicamatl</em>,
although they hadde his licence, séeyng the people of the
countrey armed with Launces of fiue and twenty foote
lōg: but yet at lēgth leauing cowardise aside, they procéeded
forwards. <em class="italic">Coatelicamatl</em> receyued thē curteously, and
shewed them sixe or seauen riuers with golde, out of the
which graynes of golde were taken in his presence, who
gaue the same moster vnto them, and sente also his Embassadors
to <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, offering his lande and person vnto
him, with certayne mantels, and Iewels of golde.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> more reioyced of the Embassage, than of the
gold and presents, knowing thereby that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> hys
enimies desired his friendshippe: but <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> and hys
counsell liked not the matter, for although <em class="italic">Coatelicamatl</em>
is no great Lord, yet his people are good souldyers, and
his countrey full of wildernesse, of Rockes and Mountaynes.
The other that wente to <em class="italic">Tutepec</em>, which standeth
néere the sea coast, and twelue leagues frō <em class="italic">Malinaltepec</em>,
returned likewise with moster of golde of two Riuers,
and brought newes that the Countrey was fit to buylde
vppon, with hope to reape muche golde, finding once an
arte to get it out of the riuer.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> hearing these news, prayed <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> to build
a house there in the name of the Emperoure <em class="italic">Charles</em>,
who incontinente sente thither workemen and labourers,
whyche within two monethes hadde built a greate
house, and other thrée little houses round aboute it, with
a ponde of water full of fishe, and fiue hundred Duckes,
and a thousand fiue hundred Turkie cockes and hennes,
and muche housholde stuffe, so that the gifte was worth
twentie thousand Castlins of golde. He gaue vnto hym
also twenty bushels of the grayne called <em class="italic">Centli</em>, readye
sowen, and two thousand stockes of trées called <em class="italic">Cacauatl</em>,
whiche bringeth forthe the fruite <em class="italic">Cacao</em>, that serueth for
money and meate. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> began this husbandrye, but yet
made not an ende thereof, with the comming of <em class="italic">Pamfilo
de Naruaiz</em>, and the vprore in <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, whiche shortly followed.
He also besoughte <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> to certifie him if
there were any sure porte or harbor on the Sea coast,
where the Spanish nauie mought ride in safetie: he aunswered
that he knew of none, but that he woulde sende to
make enquirie thereof. And forthwith he commaunded
all that coast to be painted in a cloath made of cotten
woll, with all the riuers, bayes, créekes and capes that
were within his dominion. In all the same portrayture
did not appeare anye porte, skale, or sure roade, sauyng a
gulfe that falleth out of the Mountaynes, which place is
now called the harbor of <em class="italic">Saint Martine</em>, and <em class="italic">Saint Anthonie</em>
in the prouince of <em class="italic">Coazacoalco</em>. The <em class="italic">Spanyards</em> thought
the same to be a straight or passage into the South sea,
to passe vnto the <em class="italic">Maluccos</em> and spicerie, but they were deceiued
although they beléeued the thing that they desired.
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> for this purpose sent tenne Spanyardes, all good
marriners and Pylots, in companye of the <em class="italic">Indians</em> that
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> sent on that voyage at his owne cost.</p>

<p>They departed, and came to <em class="italic">Chalohicoeca</em>, where firste
they came aland, the which place is now called <em class="italic">S. Iohn de
Vlhua</em>.</p>

<p>They wente 70. leagues along the coast, without finding
any Riuer, although they mette with many brookes
of shallowe water, not fytte for a roade for Shyppes.</p>

<p>They aported at <em class="italic">Coazacoalco</em>, the Lorde whereof was
enimie to <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, hys name was <em class="italic">Tuchintlec</em>, who
friendly receyued the Spanyardes, for he hadde intelligence
of them, at their lying at <em class="italic">Potonchan</em>. He gaue vnto
them boates, to sounde and séeke the Riuer, where they
found sixe fadome in deapth, and wente vppe that Riuer
twelue leagues, wher they descryed many great townes,
and it séemed a fruitefull soyle. This <em class="italic">Cazike Tuchnitlec</em>,
sente vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em> with the Spanyards certayne gold, precious
stones, and cloth of cotten, with apparrell made of
skynnes, and tygers, requesting his friendship, and to admitte
him tributarie to the Emperour, paying yéerely a
certayne portion of his riches, with suche condition, that
the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Culhua</em> should not enter into his iurisdictiō.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> muche reioysed with these messages, and was
glad of the finding of the faire riuer, for the Marriners
hadde enformed him, that from the riuer of <em class="italic">Grijalua</em> vnto
<em class="italic">Panuco</em>, was no riuer to be found, but I beléeue they were
deceyued. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> returned backe agayne some of those
messengers, with a present of Spanish ware for <em class="italic">Tuchnitlec</em>,
and to be better enformed of all his meaning, with a
special charge to knowe the cōmoditie of that porte and
Countrey, who went, and in shorte time returned wel satisfyed
of their demaund: wherevpon <em class="italic">Cortes</em> sente thyther

The weake courage and stomake of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
caused his subiectes not onely to
murmure, but also to seeke meanes of
rebellion, especially his nephew <em class="italic">Cacamazin</em>,
Lorde of <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>, who was a stoute
yong man and an honorable, and one y<sup>t</sup>
receiued greate griefe of his Vncles imprisonment: and
seeing that y<sup>e</sup> matter séemed long, he besought his Vncle
to procure his libertie, and to shew himselfe a Lorde, and
not a slaue: but séeing at length that he could not accepte
and follow his councell, he began to stirre in the matter,
threatning the death and destruction of the Spanyardes.
Some said, that <em class="italic">Cacama</em> did begin that matter, to reuenge
the iniurie and dishonor done vnto his Vncle. Others
saide, that his meaning was to make himselfe Kyng of
<em class="italic">Mexico</em>. Others held opinion, that his pretence was only
to make an ende of y<sup>e</sup> Spanyards. But let it be for whatsoeuer
purpose. Once he gathered a great army, which he
coulde not want, although <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> was prisoner, especially
against y<sup>e</sup> Spanyards. He published that he would
redéeme his Vncle out of Captiuitie, and expulse the
Straungers, or else kill and eate them.</p>

<p>This was a terrible newes for the Christians, but yet
for all those bragges <em class="italic">Cortes</em> dismayde not, rather hée determined
forthwith to prepare himselfe for the warres,
and to besiege him in his owne house and Towne, sauing
that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> disturbed him, saying that <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>
was a place very strong, and scituated in water, and
that <em class="italic">Cacama</em> was a man of bolde and stoute courage,
and had at commaundemente of the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Culhua</em>, and
was also Lorde of <em class="italic">Culhuacan</em> and <em class="italic">Otumpa</em>, whiche were
fortes of great strength, thinking to bring the matter to
a better passe another way: so that <em class="italic">Cortez</em> ruled himselfe
by the counsell of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, and sent vnto <em class="italic">Cacama</em>, praying
him to haue in remembrance the friendshippe that
hadde bin betwixt them two, from the time that he came
and broughte hym into <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and that alwayes peace
was better than warre, and especially for a noble man
of vassals, for the begynnyng of warres was pleasant to
hym that knewe not what warres meante: and in so doyng,
he shoulde do both pleasure and seruice to the Kyng
of <em class="italic">Spayne</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cacama vvas vvise.</div>

<p><em class="italic">Cacama</em> aunswered, that he had no friendship with him
that woulde take away hys honor and kingdome, and
that the warres whych he pretended, was profitable for
his vassals, and in defence of their Countrey and Religion,
yea and before he determined peace, he meante to
reuenge hys Vncles wrongs and his goddes.</p>

<p>Also (quoth he) what haue I to doe wyth the Kyng of
<em class="italic">Spayne</em>, who is a man that I know not, no nor yet would
gladly heare of hym.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> turned agayne to admonishe and require hym
diuers tymes to leaue off his determination, and wylled
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> to commaunde hym to accepte hys offer.</p>

<p>Wherevpon <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> sente vnto hym, desiryng him
to come vnto <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, to take some order in those controuersies
and discordes betwixte hym and the <em class="italic">Spanyardes</em>.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cacama</em> aunswered very sharply vnto his Vncles request,
saying, if you had bloud in your eye, or the hearte
of a Prince, you woulde not permit your selfe to bée prisoner,
and captiue of foure poore straungers, who
with their fayre speache and flatteryng talke haue bewitched
you, and vsurped your kingdome, no nor yet, suffer
the Goddes of <em class="italic">Culhua</em> to be throwen downe and spoyled,
yea and the <em class="italic">Mexican</em> religion and holy places, violated
and troden with théeues féete and deceyuers: likewise
the honour, glory, and fame of your predecessors blotted
and abased, through your faynt stomacke and cowardize.
But notwithstanding, accordyng to your request, and to
repayre our religiō, to restore the Goddes to their Temples,
to preserue the kingdome, and to procure libertie for
you and the Cittie, I will obay your commaundement:
But how? not with my handes in my bosome, but lyke a
warrier, to kill those Spaniardes who haue so affrented
the nation of <em class="italic">Culhua</em>. Our men stoode in great perill, as
well of the losing of <em class="italic">Mexico</em> as of their owne liues, if this
warre and mutinie had not soone bene qualified: for why?
<em class="italic">Cacama</em> was valiant, stoute, and a good souldier, yea and
well furnished of men of warre: also the Citizens of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,
were desirous of the same, for to redéeme <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
their prince, and to kill the Spaniardes, or else to expulse
them out of the Cittie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cacama prysoner.</div>

<p>But poore <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> remedied the matter, knowyng
or foreseing, that warres would not preuayle, yea and beleued,
that at the ende all shoulde fall vpon his backe. He
dealt with certayne Captaynes &#38; Gentlemen that dwelt
in <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em> with <em class="italic">Cacama</em>, to apprehend him, and bryng him
prysoner, cōsidering that he was their king and yet aliue.
But whether it were, that those Captaynes had serued
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> in the warres, or whether it were for giftes &#38;
rewardes, they apprehended <em class="italic">Cacama</em> being in counsell among
them, treatyng of his warres pretended, and embarked
him in a boate armed for the purpose, and so
brought him to <em class="italic">Mexico</em> without any further slander or
stryfe, and when he was comen to <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, they put him
on a riche seate, as the Kings of <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em> were wonte to
sitte vpon, beyng the greatest Prince in all that lande next
vnto <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>: and in this sorte brought him before his
vncle, who would not looke vpon him, but commaunded
him to be deliuered vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, who incontinent clapped
a payre of giues on his legges, and a payre of manacles
on his handes, and put hym into sure Guarde and
custodie.</p>

<p>After that <em class="italic">Cacama</em> was in this order prysoner, with
the consent of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> was elected Lorde and Prince
of <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em> and <em class="italic">Culhuacan</em>, <em class="italic">Cucuzca</em>, <em class="italic">Cacama</em> his yonger brother,
who was abidyng in <em class="italic">Mexico</em> with his vncle, and fled
from his brother: <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> did entitle him with the
ceremonies accustomed vnto Princes newly elected and
chosen. So that forthwith he was obeyed in <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em> by
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> his commaundement, for he was there better
beloued than <em class="italic">Cacama</em>, who was somewhat of a croked nature.
In this sorte was remedied all the former perill,
but if there had bene many <em class="italic">Cacamas</em>, it would haue fallen
out otherwise.</p>

<p>Here <em class="italic">Cortes</em> made kings, and cōmaunded with as great
auctoritie as though he had obtayned already the whole
Empire of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>: and certainely sithens his first entry
into that countrey, he had an assured hope to win <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,
and to be Lorde ouer the whole state of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A fonde beliefe.</div>

<p>My kinsmen, friendes and seruants, yée do well know
that eightene yeares I haue bene your kyng, as my fathers
and Grandfathers were, and alwaies I haue bene
vnto you a louing Prince, and yée vnto me good and obedient
subiectes, and so I hope you will remayne all the
dayes of my life. Ye ought to haue in remembrance, that
eyther ye haue heard of your fathers, or else our adeuines
haue instructed you, that we are not naturalles of this
countrey, nor yet our kingdome is durable, bycause our
forefathers came from a farre countrey, and theyr king
and captayne who brought them hither, returned againe
to his naturall countrey, saying that he woulde sende
suche as shoulde rule and gouerne vs, if by chaunce hée
himselfe returned not. Beleeue ye assuredly, that the king
whiche wée haue looked for so many yeares, is he that
hath nowe sente these Spaniardes, whiche yée here sée.
Who dothe certifie, that wée are their kinsmen, and that
they haue had notice of vs a long tyme: lette vs therefore
gyue thankes vnto the Goddes, that nowe they are
comen in our dayes, beyng a thing that we so muche desired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Poore Mutezuma.</div>

<p>Yée shall nowe doe me seruice and pleasure, that yée
yéelde your selues vnto this Captayne for vassals of the
Emperoure King of Spayne our soueraygne, I my
self haue already yéelded me for his seruitour and friend,
praying you that from hence forwardes ye obey him as
ye haue obeyed mée. And that yée yéelde and pay vnto
him the tributes, customes and seruice that ye were wont
to pay vnto me, and in so doyng, ye can doe me no greater
pleasure. Hys harte then woulde not suffer hym to
speake any more, with the sobbes, sighes, and teares,
that fell from hys eyes. All his subiectes there presente
fell into a crie, wéepyng and mournyng, that for a good
space they had no power to speake: they gaue thankes, and
sighings, vtteryng with their mouthes many dolefull, and
sorrowfull speaches, yea that it pitied our owne men at
the hartes. But in conclusion, they answered that they
would obey his commaundement. Then <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> and
the Burgesses of Parliament in order yelded themselues
for vassals of the king of <em class="italic">Castile</em>, promising loyaltie. This
acte was set downe by the Notarie, and with witnesses
auctorized. Then the <em class="italic">Indians</em> departed home to their
houses with sorowfull hartes, God knoweth, as you may
imagine. It was a straunge thing to sée <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> wéepe
with so many Noble men and Gentlemen, yea and with
what griefe they became subiects to an vnknowē Prince,
but they coulde not otherwise doe, seyng that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
did commaunde the same.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A true prophecie.</div>

<p>Also they had a certaine Prognostication and forwarning
by their Priestes of the comming from the east parties
a straunge people, white of colour and bearded men,
who should winne and rule that countrey. Likewise there
was a secrete talke amōg them, that in <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> should
ende and finishe, not alone the lynage of <em class="italic">Culhua</em>, but also
the Empyre and kingdome: therefore some were of opinion,
not to name him <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> whiche signifieth, agrieued
with misfortune. They say also that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> himself
had many times answere of the Oracle of the Gods,
that in him shoulde finishe the <em class="italic">Mexican</em> Emperours, and
that no childe of his shoulde succéede in his kingdome,
and that he should lose his seate in the eyght yeare of his
raigne: &#38; for these causes he woulde neuer procure warre
to withstande the Spaniardes, beleuyng that they should
be his successours. Yet on the other side he thought his opinion
would take no place, for that he had raygned seuentene
yeares: But this should séeme to come from the
prouidence of God, whiche giueth kingdomes and taketh
them away.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> gaue vnto <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> moste hartie thankes on
the behalfe of the Emperour, and for himself, and comforted
him, who was very sad, promysing also that alwayes
he should be king and Lorde, &#38; commaunde as heretofore
he had done, and better, yea and also he should be chief ruler
of all the other landes and countreys, that he shoulde
gette and bryng to the seruice of the Emperour.</p>

After certaine dayes that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> and
his counsell had yéelden their obedience,
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> sayde vnto him, how that the Emperour
was at great costes &#38; charges in
his warres, wherfore it should be necessary
that his newe vassals shoulde begin
to serue in some thing, and to pay their tribute, willyng
him to sende throughout his dominion to sée what coulde
be gathered of Gold, and that he himselfe should beginne
firste to pay tribute to the example of others. <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
answered that he was contented so to doe, willyng
that some of his men shoulde goe vnto the house of foule
for the same. There went many, and there sawe golde in
planches like brickebattes, Iewels, and péeces wrought
in a hall, and two chambers which were opened vnto thē.
The Spaniardes wōdering at the sight, would not touch
any thing, without giuing firste aduertisement to <em class="italic">Cortes</em>,
who incontinent went thither, and caused it all to be carried
to his lodgyng: besides this treasure <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> gaue
vnto him rich clothes of cotten and feathers maruelously
wouen in figures &#38; colours, it séemed without cōparison,
for the Spaniardes had neuer séene the like: he gaue vnto
him more, twelue shooting tronkes, wherewith he himself
was wont to passetime: some of them were paynted with
birdes, beasts, floures &#38; trées very perfite, a worke surely
much to be commended: and some of them were engrauē
very curiously, with their mouldes and pellets of golde.</p>

<p>He sente also his seruants by twoo and twoo, and fiue
and fiue, ech company with one Spaniarde, to the Lords
of other prouinces, fourescore, and a hundred leagues frō
<em class="italic">Mexico</em>, to gather in golde for the accustomed tributes,
and newe seruice to the Emperour. Euery Lorde and
Seignior payde the quantitie appointed &#38; taxed by <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
in golde, plate, iewels, stones and pearles.</p>

<p>The messengers returned, although they had taried
somewhat long on their iourney, of whom <em class="italic">Cortes</em> receyued
all that they brought, and caused it to be molten, out of
the whiche was had in fine golde .1600000. Castlins, of
the value of seuen shillings and sixe pence the péece, and
rather more, and also fiue hundred markes of plate, after
sixe Ducates the marke.</p>

<p>This treasure was deuided among the Souldiers, but
not all: euery man was payde accordyng to his office.
The horsemen had twise as muche as the footemen. Also
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> was payde out of the stocke the money promised
him in <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em>.</p>

<p>There came to the kings parte .32000. Castlins and a
hundred markes of plate, the whiche was wrought there
in platters, saucers, cuppes, ewers and other péeces, according
to the <em class="italic">Indian</em> fashion, to be sent to the Emperour. Besides
this, the present that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> layde aside, and takē out
of the stocke to send to y<sup>e</sup> Emperour, was worth .100000.
Ducates, in pearles, precious stones, golde, and feathers,
feathers and siluer, and many other iewels, as the gallant
tronkes, whiche beside their value were straunge to behold,
wrought with the brauery aforesayde. This present
appoynted, was not sent, for that and al the rest was

<p class="drop-cap">
<img class="drop-cap isize7" src="images/i243.jpg" width="110" height="106" alt="" />
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> seyng himselfe riche and mightie, he occupied
hymselfe in thrée things, the one was
to sende vnto <em class="italic">Santo Domingo</em> and other Ilands,
newes of his procéedings and prosperitie, and
also money to prouide menne, horses and armour, for his
owne company were to fewe for so greate a countrey.
The other was, to take fully and wholly the state of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
hauing him prisoner, and also at his commaundement
<em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, <em class="italic">Coatelicamath</em>, and <em class="italic">Tuchintlec</em>, knowyng also
that the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Panuco</em>, <em class="italic">Tecoantepec</em>, and <em class="italic">Mechuacan</em>,
were mortall enimies to the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>, who woulde ayde
and assist him hauing néede of their helpe, his thirde pretence
was, to procure all the <em class="italic">Indians</em> to be Christened, the
which purpose he tooke first in hand, as a thing most nedefull.
On the other side, <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> repented himselfe, hauyng
newes that <em class="italic">Pamfilo de Naruaiz</em> was arriued, who
came as enimy to <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, yea and after all this he was
at length driuen out of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>. These notable things
shalbe rehersed in their order. But now <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> came,
and desired <em class="italic">Cortes</em> to departe out of his countrey, aduising
hym that otherwise bothe he and his menne were in perill
of killyng, saying also, that thrée especiall causes
moued him to this requeste: the one was, the dayly
sute of the subiectes, who enportuned him to come out
of captiuitie, and to murder the Spanyardes, saying,
that it was a great shame for them to suffer theyr Prince
to bée in pryson in the power of so fewe straungers,
whom they might vse as a footebal: hauing dishonored thē
and robbed them of their goodes, gatheryng and heaping
vp their gold for themselues, &#38; for their king, who as séemed
by their doings, was but a poore fellowe, and if hée
would not accept their offer and sute, that then of theyr
owne auctoritie they would take the thyng in hande, for
so much as he refusing to be theyr king they woulde also
refuse to be his vassals, giuyng warnyng and aduice that
he should looke for no better rewarde at the Spaniardes
handes, than <em class="italic">Qualpopoca</em> and <em class="italic">Cacama</em> his Neuewe had receiued,
although they shoulde flatter him neuer so muche.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A suttle Foxe.</div>

<p>An other cause was that the Diuell had appeared vnto
him, and willed him to kill those Christians, or dryue
them out of the lande, threatnyng him that if he did not
so, that then he woulde goe from him and neuer talke any
more with him, for (quoth he) with their gospels, baptisme
and deuotion, they doe muche displease me. <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
answered him, that there was no reason to kill thē
being his friendes and honest men, but he would entreate
them to departe, (vnto this) the Diuell answered that hée
should do so, and therein he would receyue great pleasure,
for eyther he woulde goe his way and leaue him, or else
that Christian fellowes should departe, for they sow here
(quoth he) a Christian fayth y<sup>e</sup> which is much against our
Religiō, and can not dwell both togither. Another cause
was, that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> was not well pleased with the imprysonment
of <em class="italic">Cacama</em>, whō once he loued excedyng wel:
so in fine, secretely hee repented him of all that was past
in the Spanyardes fauour, and chiefly by the persuasion
of the Diuell, who sayde that he coulde not doe vnto him
a more acceptable seruice, and of greater pleasure to the
Goddes, than to expell the Spaniardes and abolishe the
name of Christians, and in so doyng, the seate of Kings
should not finish in the linage of <em class="italic">Culhua</em>, but rather be enlarged,
&#38; his childrē should raigne after him, wishing him
not to beléeue in prophesies, sithence the eight yeare was
past, and was nowe in the eyghtenth yeare of his raigne.
For these causes, or possible for other whiche we knowe
not off, <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> prepared an army of a hundred thousand
men so secretely, that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> knew not thereof, to the
effecte, that if the Spanyardes woulde not departe, being
once more required, that then he meant not to leaue one
of them aliue. With this determination, he came forthe
one day into the yard or courte, and had long conference
and consultation with his Gentlemen aboute this matter.
This done, he sente for <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, who liked not this
newes, saying to him selfe, I pray God this message
be to good purpose, and taking twelue of his men whych
were readyest at hand, went to know wherefore hée had
sente for him. <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> arose from the place where hée
sate, and tooke <em class="italic">Cortez</em> by the hande, commaunding a stoole
to be brought for him, and so sate them downe both togither,
and beganne his talke as followeth. Sir, I beséeche
you to departe from this Citie and Countrey, for my
Gods are sore offended with me, bycause I doe, and haue
permitted you héere so long: demaunde of me what you
please, and it shall be giuen you, bycause I loue you well:
and thinke you not, that I giue you this warning in iest,
but rather in good earnest, therefore it is conuenient, that
you depart. It séemed strange vnto <em class="italic">Cortez</em> this talke. Also
he saw by the countenance of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, that some thing
was a working, and before the interpreter of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
had made an end of his talke, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> willed one of his mē
to goe forthwith, and to aduise all his fellowes, saying,
y<sup>t</sup> the waight of their liues was in questiō. Then our mē
called to remembrance what was tolde them in <em class="italic">Tlaxcallon</em>,
considering that it was néedeful of courage and help
from God to bring them out of that daunger. Whē <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
had ended his tale, I haue (quoth <em class="italic">Cortes</em>) vnderstood
your meaning, and doe thanke you for the same: also I
would know when it is your pleasure that we should depart,
and it shal be done. Euen when it please you (quoth
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>) take the time that you thinke méete, and againste
that time will I prepare a hundred waighte of
gold for you, and fiftie pound waight to each of your mē.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> sayde, you knowe, that when I came into thys
Countrey, I commaunded all my Shippes to be sonke,
so that nowe I haue néede of time conueniente to builde
vessels to carrie vs into oure Countrey: wherefore my
request is, that you commaund some of your Carpēters
to be called, to cutte downe timber for the purpose, for I
haue men that can make the vessels. And this done, wée
will departe, so that you giue vs the golde whiche you
haue promised, and certifie you the same to youre Gods
and vassals.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> receyued great pleasure at this aunswere,
and sayd, your request shall be fulfilled: and incontinente
he sent for many Carpenters. Likewise <em class="italic">Cortes</em> prepared
certayne of his Marriners for Shipwrightes. All the
which workemen went vnto great woddes of Pinetrées,
and there cut downe the timber necessarye for the purpose.
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> being a simple man, gaue credite to all
<em class="italic">Cortez</em> his talke: <em class="italic">Cortes</em> likewise aduertised his men of his
procéedings, and sayd vnto them, <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> would haue
vs departe out of his Countrey, bycause his vassals and
the Diuell hathe entised him therevnto: wherefore it is
néedefull that we build shipping, and therefore I praye
you goe with these <em class="italic">Indians</em>, and procure to cut downe the
best timber fit for oure purpose, and in the meane season
God will prouide for vs, whose affayres we haue nowe
in hand, of remedie and succour in suche sort that we lose
not this frutefull countrey. It is also necessary, that whē
you come vnto the wodde, that you make all the delay
possible, giuing a shew that you are busie occupyed, and
with great desire to make an ende, that those <em class="italic">Indians</em> may
suspect nothing of oure pretence. Departe in Gods name,
and aduise me alwayes what doth passe in your affaires.</p>

Eight dayes after their departure toward

at the coast of <em class="italic">Chalchicoeca</em>. The <em class="italic">Indians</em> of
that coast aduised <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> therof, who
was not a little afraide with the newes, &#38;
called <em class="italic">Cortes</em> vnto him, who feared asmuch
some vprore there, and when they shewed <em class="italic">Cortez</em> y<sup>t</sup> <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
was come forth into the yarde, he suspected that if
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> pleased, they shoulde be all destroyed. Wherefore
he said vnto his men, maisters and friends, <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
hath sent me, considering what passed this other day, I
hold it for no good token. I nowe goe to knowe his wyll:
wherefore, whatsoeuer happen, be you alwayes vigilant
and ready, commending your selues to God. Remember
also whome ye are, and who are these Infidels, abhorred
of God, and friends vnto the Diuel, without weapon, and
experience in warre: if we chance to fight, the handes of
each of vs shal shew by déede with sword, the vallor and
courage of our heartes: yea, and although we all die, yet
shall we remaine with victory, for that we haue fulfilled
the thing we tooke in hand, and the seruice which we owe
vnto God as faithfull Christiās, with our duetie as true
subiects to our prince. They all answered, saying, we wil
do all our possibilitie while life lasteth, withoute feare of
perill or daunger, for we lesse estéeme deathe than honor.
With this aunswere <em class="italic">Cortes</em> wente to <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, who
sayde vnto him, <em class="italic">Senior</em> Captayne, you shall vnderstande
that now you haue Shippes wherein you may departe,
therefore now at your pleasure make you ready.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> answered, not knowing of that shipping, saying,
Mightie Sir, when my Shippes are finished I will depart,
nay (quoth <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>) I meane not those Shyppes,
for there are ariued eleuen other Shippes at the coast
néere vnto <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em>, and shortlye I shall be certifyed,
whether the people that are come in them, are come a
shore, and then shall we know what people, and how many
they are in number. Blessed is Iesu Christe (quoth
<em class="italic">Cortez</em>) vnto whome I giue most hartie thankes for his
great mercies shewed vnto me, and to the Gentlemen of
my company. One of <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his men went to shewe the
glad tidings to their fellowes, who then receyued double
strength, praysing God, and embraced one another wyth
great pleasure and ioy. And <em class="italic">Cortes</em> with <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> béeing
in communication togither, came another poast, who
broughte newes of fourescore Horsemen that were landed,
with eyght hundred footemen, and twelue péeces of
Ordinance, and shewed painted in a cloth the whole relation
both of men, horses, shippes, and ordinance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">At the time of neede prouideth God.</div>

<p><em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> hearing the newes that this poast hadde
broughte, arose from his seate, and tooke <em class="italic">Cortes</em> in hys
armes, saying, now do I more loue you, than I haue done
héeretofore, and will this day dyne with you. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> gaue
him thankes for the one and the other, and in this sorte
wente hande in hand to <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his Chamber, who willed
his Spanyards not to make any extraordinary ioy, or alteration,
but that they shoulde kéepe all togither with vigilant
watche, and to giue hartie thankes vnto God for
the comfortable newes. <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> and <em class="italic">Cortes</em> dyned
togither with greate content and pleasure, the one thynking
to abide and to enioy the kings state and Countrey,
the other thinking that then they woulde auoyd the land.
But notwithstanding all these ymaginations, a certaine
<em class="italic">Indian</em> Captaine importuned <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> secretely to kill
all <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his menne, being but few in number, and then
should he be the readier to dispatch the others that were
newly come, and not to permitte them to ioyne one with
another: yea and againe, when the newe come menne
shoulde knowe of the deathe of their countreymen, they
would not presume to abide in the lande.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A drunken reckoning.</div>

<p>With this counsell <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> called many his friends
and chiefe estates to counsell, propounding the case and
iudgement of the Captaine, whych béeyng among them
throughly hearde, there were many of sundrye opinions,
but the conclusion was, to permitte the other Spanyards
to come, saying, the more enimies, the more gaine, and if
we kill but those whiche are héere, then the others wyll
returne to their shippes, and so shall we not make the solemne
sacrifice of them to the Gods, according to our desire.
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> was occupyed in this counsell with fiue
hundred noblemen and Gentlemen dayly, and accordyng
to determination, they commaunded to cherish and serue
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> and his company more than ordinary, saying their
ioy was at an ende.</p>

<em class="italic">Iames Velasques</em> béeyng sore agréeued,
with desire of reuenge against <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, not
only for his expences at the time of preparation
of <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his fléete, whiche was
but small, but of méere hatred of the present
honor &#38; prosperitie of <em class="italic">Cortes</em>. Wherevpon
he inuented greate causes and quarrels againste
him, saying and alleaging, that <em class="italic">Cortez</em> hadde not giuen
accompt of his procéedings vnto him, béeyng Gouernoure
of <em class="italic">Cuba</em>, and <em class="italic">Cortez</em> his Deputie, but rather without
his consent and knowledge, had sente to <em class="italic">Spayne</em> to the
King, aduise of his discouery, as who would say, that was
treason, or an euill facte: but chiefly his fury was, knowing
how <em class="italic">Cortes</em> had sent an honorable present, with the
Kings parte or portion of treasure vnto <em class="italic">Spayne</em>, yea and
whole relation of the discouery, with <em class="italic">Francisco de Monteio</em>,
and <em class="italic">Alounso Fernandez Portocarrero</em>, the whiche procéedings
<em class="italic">Iames Velasques</em> meant to disturbe, for that he hadde
layde in ambushe a coupell of caruels, to haue taken <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
hys presente, and messengers, the whiche his pretence
and purpose tooke no place, so that with the prosperous
newes of <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, his furie and madnesse the more encreased,
ymagining still his destruction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A noble Iudge.</div>

<p>And being occupyed in these fonde ymaginations, it
happened that his Chaplin, one <em class="italic">Benito Martine</em>, broughte
letters from the Emperoure vnto him, with title and letters
pattentes, of Generall and chiefe Gouernour of all
that then was discouered, inhabited, and conquered in
the land and coast of <em class="italic">Yucatan</em>. With this newes, <em class="italic">Velasques</em>
began to triumph, not only so much for the honor, as also
to driue <em class="italic">Cortez</em> from <em class="italic">Mexico</em>. Wherevpon, he incontinent
prepared this Fléete or Nauie of eleuen Shyppes, and
seauen Vergantines, with nine hundred men, and fourescore
Horses, and appoynted one <em class="italic">Pamfilo de Naruaez</em> for
Captayne Generall, and his Deputie in the regiment of
the Countrey: and for his more quicker dispatch, he himselfe
wente with him throughout that Ilande, till they
came to <em class="italic">Guaniguanico</em>, whiche is the Westermost harbor
of the Ilande, and being there <em class="italic">Naruaez</em> ready to departe
for <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and <em class="italic">Velasques</em> to returne to <em class="italic">Cuba</em>, came the lisenciat
<em class="italic">Lucas Vasques de Aillon</em>, a chiefe Iudge of <em class="italic">Santo
Domingo</em>, in name of the whole Chancery, to require
<em class="italic">Velasques</em> vpon great penalties, that he should not permitte
or suffer <em class="italic">Pamfilo de Naruaez</em> to procéede on that voyage
agaynst <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, whiche woulde bée cause of Murther, ciuil
warres, and other mischiefes among the Spanyards,
yea and that <em class="italic">Mexico</em> should be in daunger of losing, wyth
all the rest that was conquered, and in quiet to the Kings
vse, saying vnto him moreouer, that if there were anye
discorde betwéene them for goodes, or poyntes of honor,
that then it did apperteyne to the Emperoure to iudge,
and determine the cause, and not that he himselfe should
be iudge in his owne cause, vsing force against the other
partie, praying them for the seruice of God and the
King, that if they would goe to conquere, that then they
shoulde séeke other Countreys, hauing so good an armye
and fléete, and Countreys ynough to séeke. This diligēce,
request and authoritie of the Licentiate <em class="italic">Aillon</em>, to <em class="italic">Velasques</em>
and <em class="italic">Naruaez</em> preuayled not: he séeyng their obstinacie
and little regarde to him being a chiefe Iudge, determined
to goe with <em class="italic">Naruaez</em> in his Shippe, to lette and disturbe
the greate hurte that might follow, thinking there
in the newe <em class="italic">Spayne</em> to perswade <em class="italic">Naruaez</em>, better than in
the presence of <em class="italic">Velasques</em>, yea and also if néede should bée,
to be a meane of quietnesse betwixt them.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Pamfilo de Naruaez</em> tooke shipping in <em class="italic">Guaniguanico</em>, and
sailed till he came néere vnto <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em> with al his fléete,
and hauing intelligence that there were a hundred and
fiftie Spanyards of <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his band, he sente vnto them a
Priest, with one <em class="italic">Iohn Ruiz de Gueuara</em>, and <em class="italic">Alonso de Vergara</em>,
to require them to receyue him for their Captayne
and gouernoure. But the newe Citizens would giue no
eare to their talke, but rather apprehended them, &#38; sente
them prisoners to <em class="italic">Mexico</em> to <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, to aduertise hym of
their embassage, wherevpō <em class="italic">Naruaez</em> vnshipped his men,

The <em class="italic">Indian Comarcans</em> being as well friends to <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, as

Before <em class="italic">Cortes</em> knew the effect of the cōming
of this new fléete, his head was sore troubled,
for, on the one side he was glad of
the comming of his owne nation, on the
other side he liked not so great an armye.
Likewise he ymagined, that if they came to succour him,
he helde the Countrey for conquered: also if that they
were come againste him, he iudged the Countrey to bée
lost. He iudged also, that if they were come from <em class="italic">Spayne</em>,
that then they hadde brought to him the thing loked for,
but if they were come from <em class="italic">Cuba</em>, be feared ciuil warres.
He also thought, that from <em class="italic">Spayne</em> could not come so many
folke in so shorte space. Finally, he déemed, that his olde
enemie <em class="italic">Iames Velasques</em> was come personally, but when
he knew the whole truth, then was he muche more pensiue,
thinking that the thread of his prosperitie was
cut asunder, yea and that they would be meane to stoppe
the gappes of the whole discouery, both of the secretes of
the land, mines and treasure, as also, in the knowledge of
the friends or enimies of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>. It shoulde be also a
let to inhabite the places which he had begunne, yea and
also to Christen the <em class="italic">Indians</em>, whiche was the principall
thing that he pretended, yea &#38; a let or stop of many other
things begun in y<sup>e</sup> seruice of God &#38; the prince, fearing also
by flying from one inconuenience, to fall into many,
and also if he should permit <em class="italic">Pamphilo de Naruaez</em> to come
vnto <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, it shoulde be a meane of hys perdition:
if likewise he should encounter him, he feared some rebellion
in the Citie, and the setting at libertie of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
putting in perill his owne honour, life, and trauayle: and
to auoyde all these daungers and inconueniences, he determined
remedy. First, he dispatched twoo men, the one
vnto <em class="italic">Iohn Velasques de Leon</em>, who was gone to inhabite at
<em class="italic">Coazacoalco</em>, willyng him at the sight of his letter to repaire
vnto <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, giuing him aduise of the comming of
<em class="italic">Naruaez</em> and of the great néede that he stoode in, of him &#38;
his company. The other messenger he sent to <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em>, to
bryng full relation of the arriuall of <em class="italic">Naruaez</em>, and what
was his pretence.</p>

<p>The letter sent to <em class="italic">Iohn Velasques</em>, came no sooner to his
hande, but forthwith he obeyed and fulfilled the same, contrary
to the expectation of <em class="italic">Naruaez</em>, for he was his brother
in law, and kinsman vnto <em class="italic">Iames Velasques</em>. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> seing
his constancie, had him euer after that tyme in great estimation.</p>

<p>From the <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em> came twentie of the townes men
with certificat what <em class="italic">Naruaez</em> had published, and brought
with them a priest, with <em class="italic">Alonso Gueuara</em> and <em class="italic">Iohn ruiz de
Vergara</em>, who had comen to <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em> to amotiue the
towne, vnder colour that they had brought the commissiō
from the king. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> on the otherside, sent vnto <em class="italic">Naruaez</em>
seignior <em class="italic">Bartholome de Olmedo</em>, with other two Spaniards,
to offer vnto him his friendship, &#38; otherwise to require &#38;
commaunde him on the behalfe of the kyng &#38; of his owne,
as chiefe iustice of the land, and in the name of the rulers
and Aldermen of the towne of <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em>, who were then
in <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, that he shoulde enter peaceably, without making
any alteration vntill his auctoritie and commission
were séene and allowed, and to make no slaunder or vprore
to the hinderāce of the king his maisters procedings.</p>

<p>But al this diligence and letters of <em class="italic">Cortes</em> and the other
rulers preuailed not, he seing this, set at libertie the priest
that was brought prisoner, and sente him vnto <em class="italic">Naruaez</em>,
with certaine riche collers of gold, and other iewels with
a letter, wherein he wrote, that he was more gladder of
his comming in that fléete than any other, for the friendship
and olde acquaintaunce that had bene betwixt them,
desiring him that they mought talke and cōferre togither,
alone, for to take order to prohibite wars, sedition, bloudshedde
and disquietnesse among them, beyng of one natiō
and brethren, requestyng him to shew his cōmission from
the king vnto him, or vnto the counsell of <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em>, and
he would willingly obey it as reason did require: and if he
had not brought any such commission, yet he would make
some honest agrement with him. <em class="italic">Pamfilo de Naruaez</em> seing
himselfe strong and mightie, did little regarde <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his
letters, offers, nor requestes, and chiefly bycause <em class="italic">Iames

<em class="italic">Pamphilo de Naruaez</em> declared to the <em class="italic">Indiās</em>
that they were deceyued with their opiniō
in <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, for that he alone was Captayne
generall and chiefe Lorde, and that <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
was but a naughty man, and so were all
they of his company which are now in <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, who were
all but his boyes, and that his present commyng was to
cut of <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his head, and to chasten the others, likewyse
he meant to dryue them all out of the countrey, &#38; then to
departe himselfe, and to leaue them in full libertie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A cruell proclamation.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A madde reckenyng.</div>

<p>The <em class="italic">Indians</em> gaue credite to his talke seyng so many
bearded men and horses, and therevpon began to attende
and serue him, leauyng their olde friendes in <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em>.
Also <em class="italic">Naruaez</em> began to flatter <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, and sente him
worde that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> aboade in that countrey against the will
of his Prince, &#38; that he was a couetous rebell, who robbed
his countrey, and that he pretended to kill <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
and to make himself king. Also that his comming was to
set him at libertie, and to restore vnto him all that those
wicked fellowes had taken from him. And bicause that others
should take example of their factes, he would commaunde
them all to be slaine, willing him to take no care,
for in short space they would sée ech other. And that when
he had set him at libertie with restitution of his goodes, he
would incontinent departe his countrey. These treaties
were so foule &#38; abhominable, with the iniurious wordes
which <em class="italic">Pamfilo de Naruaez</em> spake openly against <em class="italic">Cortes</em> and
his men, yea they séemed odious vnto all his owne hoste &#38;
army, and some of his own mē checked him for the same,
especially <em class="italic">Barnardino de Santa Clara</em>, who seyng the countrey
so peaceable and so well pleased with <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, he could
not let but reprehende <em class="italic">Naruaez</em> in his wordes. Also the licenciat
<em class="italic">Aillon</em> required him diuers times to cease frō his
slanderous talke, vpon paine of death &#38; losse of his goodes,
&#38; also not to procéede towarde <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, for the great hurte
that might ensue, with slander among the <em class="italic">Indians</em>, disquietnesse
among the Spaniardes, and offence to the Emperour
his Maiestie. <em class="italic">Pamfilo de Naruaez</em> being moued with
his talke layde hand vpon <em class="italic">Aillon</em>, being a chiefe iudge for
the King, and apprehended also his Secretary &#38; an other
officer, and forthwith shipped them, and sente thē to <em class="italic">Iames
Velasques</em> gouernour of <em class="italic">Cuba</em>. But when <em class="italic">Aillon</em> saw himselfe
at sea, and frée from <em class="italic">Naruaez</em>, he began to threaten y<sup>e</sup>
Mariners, cōmanding thē not to presume to carrie him to
<em class="italic">Cuba</em> to <em class="italic">Velasquez</em> his power, but onely to <em class="italic">Santo Domingo</em>,
where he was one of y<sup>e</sup> kings coūsell in chancery: the Mariners
fearing the Kings iustice, obeyed his cōmandemēt
and when he was aported at <em class="italic">Santo Domingo</em>, he wholly enformed
the Counsell there, of <em class="italic">Naruaez</em> and his wicked
dealyng, whose testimonie and information did much blemishe
the credite of <em class="italic">Velasques</em>, &#38; exalt the trauels of <em class="italic">Cortes</em>.
After that <em class="italic">Naruaez</em> had shipped away <em class="italic">Aillon</em>, he proclaymed
warre with fire and sworde agaynst <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, and promised
certayne markes of Golde to him that shoulde apprehende
or kill him, or <em class="italic">Pedro de Aluarado</em>, and <em class="italic">Gonsalo de
Sandoual</em>, with other principall persons of his company.
Also he made diuision of his goodes among his mē before
they came to possesse it. Surely these thrée poyntes were
of a man without wisedome or discretion.</p>

<p>Many of <em class="italic">Naruaez</em> his company did amotiue themselues,
through the commaundement of the Licenciat
<em class="italic">Aillon</em>, and through the fame and liberalitie of <em class="italic">Cortes</em>.
Wherevpon incontinent one <em class="italic">Pedro de Villalobos</em> a Portingal,
and sixe or seuen more fledde vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, yea and others

if by chauce they should encounter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A good captayne and a vvise.</div>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> receyued the letters, but kept in silence from his

Some doe thinke that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> had suborned them with letters,
fayre promises, yea and a horse loade of chaynes and
planches of golde, which he sente secretely to <em class="italic">Naruaez</em> his
campe with a seruaunt of his, publishing likewise, that he
had an army of twoo hundreth Spaniardes in <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em>,
where he had none at all: these policies mought well be,
for he was prudent, carefull and quicke in his businesse,
and <em class="italic">Pamfilo de Naruaez</em> was slouthfull and carelesse.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Naruaez</em> made answere to <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his letter by seignior
<em class="italic">Bartholome de Olmedo</em>, the substaunce of his message was,
that forthwith he shoulde repayre to the place where he

take and kéepe that countrey for <em class="italic">Iames Velasques</em>, yea and
that already he had made a towne of men onely, with all

<p>After this letter and message sent, he dispatched likewise

<em class="italic">Cortes</em> to depart and leaue the countrey vpon paine

<em class="italic">Cortes</em> perceyuing the small fruyte that his

at the handes of <em class="italic">Naruaez</em>, and that in
no case, he woulde shewe his commission
whiche came from the kyng, he determined
to goe vnto him, and according to the olde Prouerbe,
Face to face doth get respect, and likewise if it were possible,
to agrée vpon some good order and quietnesse: wherevpon
he sent <em class="italic">Rodrigo Aluarez</em> his surueyor, with <em class="italic">Iohn Velasques</em>,
and <em class="italic">Iohn del Rio</em>, to treate with <em class="italic">Naruaez</em> of many
matters, whereof thrée things were the principalest. The
first was, that they two might méete alone, or else so many,
for so many, and that <em class="italic">Naruaez</em> should permit <em class="italic">Cortes</em> to
abyde in <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and he withall his company shoulde
cōquere <em class="italic">Panuco</em> or other kingdomes, also that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> would
pay the charges, and haue consideration to gratifie his
souldiers, or else that <em class="italic">Naruaez</em> should abide in <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and
deliuer vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em> .400. of his men, to the intent that with
them, and his owne men he myght procéede to séeke other
countreys to conquere. Laste of all, he required to sée the
kings commission, for that he would obey the same. <em class="italic">Naruaez</em>
liked none of these offers, only he accepted that they
should méete togither with ech of them ten Gentlemē for
securtie, bound with solemne othe, and firmed this agréement
with their names. But it tooke no effect, for <em class="italic">Rodrigo
Aluarez</em> aduised <em class="italic">Cortes</em> that <em class="italic">Naruaez</em> had made a snare
to apprehend him, or to kill him at their méeting. <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
vnderstoode the matter, or else he had some other intelligence
by some that loued him wel. And this former agrement
taking no place, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> determined to goe vnto him.</p>

<p>But before his departing, he declared vnto his cōpany,
saying, I trust ye haue in remembrāce what &#38; how much
I haue done for you, since y<sup>e</sup> beginning of this enterprise,
yea &#38; also how louingly &#38; friendly yée haue dealt for me:
Yée shall now vnderstand that <em class="italic">Iames Velasques</em>, in stéede of
thankes giuing vs, hath sent to murder vs, <em class="italic">Pamfilo de Naruaez</em>,
who is a stubborne &#38; an vnreasonable man, one readie
to execute our good desertes done in the seruice of God
&#38; our Prince, with an euill reward. And the cause is only,
for doyng our duetie in the sending of the Kings parte &#38;
portiō to his Roiall person &#38; not vnto him. Also this <em class="italic">Naruaez</em>
hath already confiscated our goodes, and giuen them
to other men, and our bodies condemned to the Gallows,
yea and our fame and honour plaide at tables, with great
iniurious &#38; slanderous wordes proclaymed agaynst vs,
which things truly are not of a Christian, no nor yet we
with Gods helpe will let the matter so to slippe: yea and
though we ought to leaue the reuengment vnto God, yet
we will not suffer them to enioy our trauayles &#38; paynes,
who are now comen white fingered to spoile the bloud of
their neighbours, yea &#38; like madde men to striue against
their owne nation, sowing slander among those <em class="italic">Indians</em>
which serued vs as our friēds, yea &#38; procuring more cruel
warres, than the ciuill warre betwene <em class="italic">Mario</em> &#38; <em class="italic">Sila</em>, or of
<em class="italic">Cesar</em> &#38; <em class="italic">Pompeio</em>, who turned vpsidowne the Romaine Empire.
Wherfore I do determine to méete him by y<sup>e</sup> way, &#38;
not to suffer him to come vnto <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, for it is better to
say, God saue you, than they to come &#38; say who is there?
yea &#38; though they are many, a good hart doth breake euil
fortune, as it hath appered by vs, who haue passed thorow
the pikes since our cōming hither: moreouer, I doubte not
but that many of <em class="italic">Naruaez</em> his cōpany will come vnto vs.
Therfore my déere friends doe I giue you aduise of my

After al his talk &#38; answer of his souldiers,
he wēt to visite &#38; to comune w<sup>t</sup> <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
for to departe on his iourney, w<sup>t</sup> somewhat
y<sup>e</sup> lesser care, &#38; also to proue the minde &#38; wil
of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, vnto whome he vttered his
mind as foloweth. Sir, you know y<sup>e</sup> loue y<sup>t</sup> I haue, &#38; desire
to serue you, &#38; chiefly the trust againe, that you will haue
to my cōpanions whē I am gone frō this citie. Therfore
I pray you, that it may please you to remaine here in this
lodgyng, &#38; to haue regard vnto these strangers, which I
leaue with you: also I cōmend vnto you, the gold &#38; iewels
whiche is in their custodie, and gyuen vnto vs of your
owne liberalitie. For I doe now goe to signifie vnto those
which of late are comen in the new fléete, how your highnesse
doth commaunde that I departe from this land, and
that they doe not agrauate or molest your subiectes, nor
yet presume to enter into your countrey, but that they remayne
on your coast, vntill we be ready to departe with
them, according to your will and pleasure. And if in the
meane season, any of your subiects be so vnaduised, as to
molest my men, whiche now remayne in your power and
Guarde, that then it may please you to be their shielde,
succour, and onely defence. <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> promised to fulfill
his request, wishing him moreouer, that if any in his iourney
shoulde offende him, then immediatly to aduise him,
and that he would sende his men of warre to chasten thē,
yea and also (if it pleased him,) he woulde giue vnto hym
guydes to salfe conduct him through his owne dominion

with moste hartie thankes for the same, and gaue vnto
him certayne Spanishe apparell, and other glasen

<em class="italic">Cortes</em> was so wel beloued among hys companie,
that they offered willingly to goe with
him, by reason whereof he chose .250. men fitte

beséeching them onely to haue speciall regard

<p>Passing through <em class="italic">Chololla</em> and <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, he was honorably
receyued and lodged, and aboute fiftéene leagues
from <em class="italic">Zempoallan</em> where <em class="italic">Naruaez</em> was abiding, he mette
with two Priestes, and his old especial friend <em class="italic">Andres de
Duero</em>, who had lente him money for the setting forthe of
that voyage. These thrée persons came to require him to
obey the Generall lately come as Lieutenant to the Gouernour
<em class="italic">Velasques</em>, and to deliuer vnto him the Countrey,
with all the fortes or Castels therein, aduising him, that
if he would not accomplish the same, that then he woulde
procéede againste him, euen as an enemie and Rebell, to
the execution of death. Likewise, if he would fulfill the request
made vnto him, that then he shoulde haue libertie,
and conueniente shipping to depart, both for him, and as
many as would goe with him. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> aunswered, that hée
would rather suffer deathe, than to leaue the Countrey
whiche he had conquered and pacifyed with his handes
and industrie, without anye commaundemente from the
Emperoure: and (quoth he) if againste all equitie and iustice,
he will contend with me in warre, I will defend me
as well as I may, and if I haue the victory (as I trust in
God and the righte that I haue on my side,) I shall not
stand in néede of shipping, and if I be slaine, muche lesse.
Therefore I doe require him to shew vnto me his commission
and authoritie had from the Emperour, for vntil
I doe both sée and reade the same, I will accepte no agréemente:
and if (quoth he) that he refuse the same, that
then I dare warne, admonish, and require him to returne
to <em class="italic">Cuba</em>, the place from whence he came, and if he wil not
obey my precept, I will then apprehende him, and sende
him prisoner in yrons to the Emperoure: and with thys
aunswere dispatched the thrée messengers, sending also a
notarie of his owne, to commaund him to take his shipping,
and to departe without making any altercation in
the Countrey, or y<sup>t</sup> ensuing of further murders and strife,
and if not, that vppon Whitsonday, whiche was within
thrée dayes following, he meante to be with him at supper.
<em class="italic">Pamfilo de Naruaez</em> made a mockery and iest at
his commaundemente, and tooke Prisoner the Notarie
whiche came from <em class="italic">Cortes</em> with that order, holding <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
for madde, who made so manye bragges with so small a
company. And before <em class="italic">Iohn Velasques de Leon</em>, and <em class="italic">Iohn de
Rio</em>, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his friendes, he mustered his men, who were
in number fourescore Hargabushers, a hūdred and twētie
Crossebowes, sixe hundred men, with other weapon,
and fourescore Horsemen, saying, how will <em class="italic">Cortes</em> defend
himselfe againste vs, nay at length he will know his dutie:
he promised money to him that shoulde eyther kyll,
or take <em class="italic">Cortes</em> prisoner. And the same offer made <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
against <em class="italic">Pamfilo</em>, who made a rounde of his footemen, and
skirmished with his Horsemen, shooting off his artillerie,
to put in feare the pore <em class="italic">Indians</em>.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Naruaez</em> signifyed againe vnto <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> with the
messengers who carried all the triumph and muster
pointed, all his former dealings, but hearing that <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
was néere at hande, he sente out hys lyght Horsemen to
dyscrie his Campe.</p>

<p>All <em class="italic">Naruaez</em> his Horses were readye sadled and brideled,
and his men armed. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> entred so close and secret,
that no man almost hearde him, and the firste worde hée
spake, hauyng all hys men within with him, was, shut
the gates, and strike, downe with them. There were at
that time many shining wormes, whiche with their glistering
séemed matches of Hargabushe, so that if one
péece at that time had bin discharged, they woulde haue
bin in a great feare.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Naruaez</em> béeing about to put on his priuie coate, came
one vnto him, saying: Sir, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> is néere your lodgyng,
let him come in (quoth he) for he commeth to talke with
me. <em class="italic">Naruaez</em> had his men in foure Towers of his lodging,
and he himselfe was in the one, with a hundred
Spanyardes, and at his dore thirtéene péeces of Ordinance
ready charged. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> commanded his chiefe Sheriffe
<em class="italic">Gōsalo de Sādoual</em>, with fortie or fiftie of his fellowes,
to goe vp into <em class="italic">Naruaez</em> his Chamber, and he himselfe
with other twentie men abode at the dore to defende and
kéepe that none might enter thereat, vntil he had finished
his businesse. The residue of his men besieged the other
Towers, so that they might not succoure one another.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A darke night for Naruaez.</div>

<p><em class="italic">Naruaez</em> hearing the noyse, woulde néedes fighte, although
he was required to stay his handes, and comming
out at his Chamber dore, they strake out one of his
eyes with a pike, and then they layde hande vpon hym,
dragging and drawyng him downe the stayres by the
héeles, and when he sawe hymselfe broughte before <em class="italic">Cortes</em>,
he sayde, oh <em class="italic">Senior Cortes</em>, thanke your great fortune,
in hauyng my person prisoner: who aunswered hym againe,
oh <em class="italic">Naruaez</em>, the hauing of thy body prisoner, is the
least thing that I haue done, sithence I came into thys
lande. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> commaunded forthwith to lay him in yrōs,
and to carrie him to the riche towne of <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em>, where
he abode prisoner certayne yeares.</p>

<p>This combat endured but a while, for within one hour
<em class="italic">Pamfilo de Naruaez</em> and the chiefest of his company were
taken prisoners, and their weapōs &#38; armour taken from
all the rest. There were slayne of <em class="italic">Naruaez</em> his men sixetéene,
and of <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his side were killed only two persons
with a péece of Ordinance. They had no leysure to giue
fire to their Ordinance, with the great diligence and hast
of <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, sauing vnto one péece that killed the two men.
The tutche holes were stopped with waxe, through the
great raine that had fallen. By this meane those that
were ouercome, did take occasion to ymagine that <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
had suborned the maister gunner, and others.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> vsed great sobrietie and discretion, for he would
not permitte anye of the prisoners to be reuiled or misused
with any iniurious wordes, no nor yet <em class="italic">Naruaez</em>, who
hadde spoken so much euill of him, although many of hys
men desired reuengement. <em class="italic">Pedro de Maluenda</em> seruaunt to
<em class="italic">Iames Velasques</em>, who was chiefe Stewarde to <em class="italic">Naruaez</em>,
fledde to the Shippes with all the stuffe that he coulde
gette, without any lette of <em class="italic">Cortes</em>. Héere may you sée what
difference and aduantage is betwixt man and man, what
did eache of these Captiues say, thinke, and doe, seldome
time dothe happen that so fewe of one nation dothe ouercome

After that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> had obteyned victorye
against <em class="italic">Naruaez</em>, he knew very well the
most part of his company, vnto whome
he spake curteously, praying them to
forget the things past, and so would hée
also. And also likewise, that it mighte
please them to goe with him to <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, whiche was the
richest Citie of all that <em class="italic">India</em>. He also restored to euerye
man his armour and weapons, whiche were taken from
them in their ouerthrowe. Hée also left very few of them
prisoners with <em class="italic">Naruaez</em>. The Horsemen tooke the fielde
with stomacke to fight, but after they had hearde of hys
offer, they submitted themselues. In conclusion, all those
that were come, hoping of spoyle, were glad to accepte
his offer, and to goe with him with faithfull promise
truly to serue him.</p>

<p>He renued his power in <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em>, and brought thyther
the nauie of <em class="italic">Naruaez</em>. He also dispatched two hundred
Spanyardes to the riuer of <em class="italic">Garay</em>, and sent also <em class="italic">Iohn
Velasques de Leon</em> with other two hundred men. To inhabite
of <em class="italic">Coazacoalco</em>. He dispatched also a Spanyarde
by post to <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, with newes of the victory, and hée
himselfe followed towarde <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, with the great care
that he had of those whome he had lefte there in guard of
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> and the Citie.</p>

<p>The Post that wente on this iourney, in steade of
thankes, was sore wounded by the <em class="italic">Indian</em> Rebelles, but
although he was so hurte, yet he returned to <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, wyth
newes that <em class="italic">Mexico</em> was reuolted, and that they had burned
the foure Foystes, also assieged the Spanish house,
and throwen downe a wall, and myned another, yea and
set fire vpon the munition, taken away their vittayles,
and had broughte them to suche extremitie, to be eyther
slayne, or remayne prisoners, sauing that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> commaunded
to ceasse the combate, yea and for all that they
woulde not leaue their armoure, nor departe from the
siege, only they somewhat amayned their furie for theyr
princes sake.</p>

<p>These newes were sorrowfull to <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, for thereby
his pleasure was turned into care, the rather to make
hast to succoure his friendes and fellowes, for if he hadde
delayed hys comming but a small whyle, he had founde
them eyther slayne, or else their bodyes ready to sacrifice:
but his greatest comforte was, that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> remayned
styll prisoner. He mustered his men in <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>,
and founde of his Spanishe nation a thousand footemen,
and néere a hundred Horsemen. He procéeded forwardes
towarde <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>, where he founde none of the
Gentlemen of his acquaintance, nor yet he there was
receyued, as in time past he had bin, but rather he found
a great alteration in the Coūtrey, and also many townes
without people, or else rebelled. In <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em> met with him
a <em class="italic">Spanyarde</em>, whome <em class="italic">Aluarado</em> had sente to desire him to
come vnto them, and to certifie hym of all the premisses,
saying moreouer, that with his comming their furye
woulde be pacifyed.</p>

<p>With this messenger came another from <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
who declared vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, that hys Lorde was innocent
of all that was done, praying hym, that if he had conceiued
any euill opinion agaynste hym, to putte away the
same agayne, and that it mighte please hym to goe directly
to hys own house, where hée abode hys comming,
wyth the Spanishe guarde that he hadde lefte with him,
who were aliue and in good healthe as he hadde lefte
them.</p>

<p>With thys message, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> and hys companye reposed
all that nyghte, and the nexte daye, béeyng Midsommer
daye, he entred into <em class="italic">Mexico</em> at dynner tyme, with hys
hundred Horsemen, and the thousande footemen, with a
greate companye of theyr friendes of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>,
<em class="italic">Huexocinco</em>,
and <em class="italic">Chololla</em>, but he saw but few folke in the stréetes,
and small entertaynement, with manye bridges broken,
and other euill tokens.</p>

<p>He came to hys lodgyng, and all those of his companye
whyche coulde not well bée lodged there, hée sente
them to the greate Temple. <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> came forth into
the yarde to receyue hym, full heauie and sorrowfull, as
it séemed, of that offence whiche his subiectes had done,
excusing hymselfe: and then euery one entred into hys
lodgyng and Chamber: but the ioy and pleasure of <em class="italic">Pedro
de Aluarado</em> was incomparable, saluting the one
the other, with demaundes and questions howe they fared,
yea and how much the one company declared of prosperitie
and pleasure, the other againe replyed as muche
of sorrow and trouble.</p>

<em class="italic">Cortes</em> procured to knowe the principall
cause of the insurrection of the <em class="italic">Mexican
Indians</em>, and hauing a generall daye of
hearyng, the charge béeyng layde against
them, some sayd, that it was through the
letters and persuasion of <em class="italic">Naruaez</em>: Others aunswered,
their desire and meaning was, to expell the straungers,
according to agréemente made, for in theyr skirmishes
they cryed nothing but gette you hence, get you hence:
Other sayde, that they pretended the libertie of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
for in theyr Combates they woulde saye, lette goe
oure God and Kyng, if you list not to bée slayne. Others
sayde, that they were Théeues, and hadde robbed
theyr golde and plate from them, whyche was in valewe
more than seauen hundred thousande duckettes: Others
cryed, héere shall you leaue the golde that you haue
taken from vs. Others sayde, that they coulde not abyde
the syghte of the <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em>, and other theyr
mortall enimies. Manye beléeued that the mutinye
was for throwyng downe theyr Goddes and Idolles:
each of these causes were sufficient to rebell, how muche
more altogither.</p>

<p>But the chiefest and most principall cause was, that
after the departure of <em class="italic">Cortes</em> towarde <em class="italic">Naruaez</em>, happened
a solemne holiday, whiche the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> were wont to celebrate,
and desiring to obserue the same, as they were
wont to do, they came and besoughte Captayne <em class="italic">Aluarado</em>
to graunt them licence, &#38; not to ymagine that they were
ioyned togither to kill the Spanyardes. <em class="italic">Aluarado</em> gaue
them licence, with such conditions, that in their Sacrifice
shoulde no mans bloude be spilte, nor yet to weare anye
weapon.</p>

<p>At this feast, sixe hundred Gentlemen and principall
persons ioyned togither in the greate temple: some doe
saye, that they were more than a thousande persons of
greate estate, but that nighte they made a maruellous
great noyse, with cornets, shels, clouen bones, wherewith
they made a straunge musicke: they celebrated the feast,
their naked bodyes couered with telc, made and wrought
with precious stones, collers, girdels, bracelettes, and
many other iewels of golde, siluer, and aliofar, with gallant
tuffes of feathers on their heads. They daunced a
daunce called <em class="italic">Mazeualiztli</em>, which is to say, deserte wyth
payne, and so they call <em class="italic">Mazauali</em> a husbandman. Thys
daunce is like <em class="italic">Netoraliztli</em>, which is another daunce. The
manner is, that they lay mattes in the Temple yarde,
and with the sounde of their Drummes, called <em class="italic">Atabals</em>,
they daunce a round, hande in hande, some singing, and others
answere, which songs were in y<sup>e</sup> honor and prayse
of the God or Saincte, whose feast it is, hoping for thys
seruice to haue rayne, corne, healthe, victory, peace, chyldren,
or anye other thing that they maye wishe for, or
desire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A couetous desire and a vile.</div>

<p>These <em class="italic">Indian</em> Gentlemen being occupied in their daunsing
and ceremonies, it fortuned that <em class="italic">Pedro de Aluarado</em>
went to the Temple of <em class="italic">Vitzilopuchtli</em> to beholde theyr doings,
and whether his goyng was of his owne accorde, or
by the consent of his cōpany I am not certaine, although
some saye that he was aduised howe the mutinie was
there conspired, as after did follow: others holde opinion,
that their onely goyng to the Temple was to beholde the
maruaylous and straunge daunce. And then seying them
so richely attyred, they coueted their Golde and Iewels
whiche they were, and besieged the Temple with tenne
Spaniardes at each dore, &#38; the Captayne entred in, with
fiftie men, and without any Christian respect slewe and
murdered them al, and tooke from them all their treasure.
Although this facte séemed odious vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, yet he dissimuled
the mater, for feare least he shoulde hurte his owne
procéedings, as time did then require knowyng not, what
néede he might haue of them, but especially to auoyde contention

The cause of this rebellion, beyng well
knowen, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> demaunded how theyr enimies
fought, mary (quoth they) after
they had taken weapon agaynst vs for
the space of ten dayes arew, they neuer
seased with great fury to assaulte and cōbat
our house, and we with feare least <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> shoulde
escape and flée vnto <em class="italic">Naruaez</em>, durst not goe out of dores
to fight in the streate, but onely to defende the house with
especiall care of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, accordyng to your charge giuen
vnto vs. Also we being but few and the <em class="italic">Indians</em> many,
who still refreshed their men, they did not onely wery vs,
but also put vs in great feare and cleane out of courage,
yea and if at the greatest brunt, <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> personally had
not ascended to the toppe of our wal, commaunding them
if euer they meant to sée him aliue, to stay and cease from
their enterpryce.</p>

<p>At the sight of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> they were all amazed, and
incontinent ceased the combat and assault. They sayde also
that with the newes of the victory had agaynst <em class="italic">Pamfilo
de Naruaez</em>, <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> requyred his men to leaue off
from theyr pretence: notwithstandyng, the <em class="italic">Indians</em> calling
to remembraunce, that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> was cōming with a greater
company, at whose returne they should haue the more
to doe, began afreshe to assaulte the house, wherevppon
some doe thinke, that it was agaynst the will of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>.
But it followed, that one day the Spaniardes
standing in greate perill, charged their greatest péece of
ordinaunce, and gyuing fire, the péece discharged not: the
<em class="italic">Indians</em> seyng the same, beganne a freshe with a marueylous
terrible noyse, vsing staues, Bowes, lances, &#38; stones
that came as thicke as Hayle, saying, nowe will wée redéeme
our King, sette our houses at libertie, and reuenge
our iniuries. But in the middest of theyr fury the péece
wente of, without any more prymyng or touche, with a
greate and fearefull thunderyng, the péece beyng great
and ful of hayle shotte, with the mayne pellotte, made a
straunge spoyle among them, and with feare they retyred.
But yet they beganne to say, well, well, shortely
shall your fleshe be boyled, although wée meane not
to eate it, for truely it is very carrayne and good for nothing.
But yet we will bestowe the same vpon the Eagles,
Lions, Tigres and Snakes, who shal be the graues
for your filthy carcases.</p>

<p>But if forthwith ye let not <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> departe, and
restore him to his libertie, yée shall quickly haue your rewarde,
for your presumption &#38; pride, who durst be so bold,
as to lay hande on <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> being our God and Lorde
that giueth vs our dayly foode. And yet yée with your filthy
théeues handes presumed to touch him, oh why dothe
not the earth open &#38; swallow you which taketh other mēs

you did profane, will rewarde you according to your deserte:
&#38; if they do not shortly execute their wrath, then let
vs alone, for we will out of hande make an ende of you.
And as for those théeues and villaines of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em> your
slaues, shall not depart praysing their gaynes, who nowe
presume to take their maisters wiues, ye and to demaund
tribute of them, vnto whome they themselues are tributors.
These &#38; such like were the wordes of the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>.
But our men, although they were in a maruelous feare,
yet they reprehended their folly as touchyng <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
saying that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> was no God, but a mortall mā as
they were, and no better, and that their Gods were vayne
idols, and their religion most false and abhominable, and
that only our God was holy, iuste, true, and infinite.</p>

In hearyng the former talke in defense of
the house, and prouiding of things necessary,
the night passed away. And in the
mornyng to proue the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> intent,
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> commaunded the market to be vsed
as in time past. <em class="italic">Aluarado</em> wished <em class="italic">Cortes</em> to
shew himself toward him as agrieued &#38; not well pleased,
makyng as though he would apprehend &#38; correct him for
the things passed, thinking that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> and his men
would haue entreated for him. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> passed not for that
talke, saying that they were infidels, diuelish and wicked
people, with whome suche complementes shoulde not bée
vsed.</p>

<p>But he commaunded a certaine principal Gentleman
of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, who stoode there presente, that out of hande he
should commaunde the market to be furnished as in time
past. This <em class="italic">Indian</em> vnderstāding that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> had spoken euil
of them, made as though he went to fulfill his commandment:
but he wente to proclayme libertie, publishyng
the heynous and iniurious wordes whiche he had harde,
so that in shorte space the matter beganne to waxe hoate,
for some went and brake downe the bridges, others went
to call all the Citizens, who ioyned themselues togither,
and besieged the Spaniardes house, with suche straunge
noyse that one coulde not heare another: the stones flewe
lyke hayle, Dartes and arrowes filled the Spanyardes
yarde, which troubled them much. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> seing this broyle,
he with certaine of his men went out at one dore, and an
other Captayne at another, with eache of them twoo hundred
men. They fought with the <em class="italic">Indians</em>, who slewe foure
Spaniardes, and wounded many moe, and of them were
slayne very fewe with their succor and defence at hande.
If our men fought with them in the streates, then would
they stoppe their passage at the bridges: if they assaulted
their houses, then they were beaten with stones from the
toppe of their houses whiche were flatte ruffed, and at
their retire they persecuted them terribly.</p>

<p>They sette fire vpon the Spaniardes house in sundry
places, but chiefly in one place they coulde not aplake the
fire a great whyle, vntill they threwe downe certayne
chambers and walles, whereas they had entered at pleasure,
had it not bene for the Artillerie, Crossebowes and
handgunnes, which were there in defence of that place.
This combat endured all that day vntill night, yea and in
the night also they had their handes full: our men had litle
leasure to sleepe, but rather spente the night in mendyng
the walles and dores, and curing the wounded men who
were more than foure score, &#38; likewise to set their men in
order &#38; readinesse for the fight of the next day following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A straunge inuention.</div>

<p>It was no sooner day, but the <em class="italic">Indians</em> beganne theyr
assault a fresh, with more courage and furie than the day
before, so that our men were fayne to trust to their artillery,
the whiche the <em class="italic">Indians</em> feared not a whitte: for if a
shotte carried ten, fiftene or twentie <em class="italic">Indians</em> at a clappe,
they would close againe as though one man had not bene
missyng. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> came out with other twoo hundreth men,
and gate some bridges, burned some houses, and slew many
that defended them. But the <em class="italic">Indians</em> were so many in
number, that no hurte appeared, yea and our men were so
fewe in comparison of them, that although they fought
al the day, yet had they much a doe to defend themselues,
how much more to offende. That day neuer a Spaniarde
was slayne outright, but thrée score of them were wounded
and hurte, wherby they had inough to do to cure them
for that night, and to procure remedy and defence against
the hurtes whiche they receyued from the house toppes.
They inuented Engines of timber made vpon whéeles,
and foure square, couered on the toppe, and with Arte to
passe through the streates: there were placed on eache of
them twentie men with Pikes, Hargabush, Crossebowes
and one double Base. Behinde the Engines wente men
with shouels and Mattockes, to throwe downe houses,
bulworkes, and to rule and gouerne the Engines.</p>

<h2 id="chap100">The death of Mutezuma.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap">
<img class="drop-cap isize5" src="images/i274.jpg" width="190" height="184" alt="" />
All the while that the Engines were a makyng,
our men came not out to fight, beyng
occupied in the worke, but onely to defende
their lodgyng. The enimies thinkyng that
they were all sore hurte and wounded, beganne
their warres agayne, reuilyng them with many
iniurious wordes, threatnyng them, that if they woulde
not deliuer <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, that they woulde giue them the
moste cruellest death that euer man suffered, and came
with great force to haue entred the house.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> desired <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> to goe vp into the sotie, which
is the toppe of the flatte roufe of the house, and to commaunde
his subiects to ceasse from their heate and furie.
At <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his request he wente vp, and leaned ouer the
wall to talke with them, who beginnyng to speake
vnto them, they threw so many stones out of the streate,
houses and windowes, that one happened to hitte <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
on the temples of his head, with whiche blowe he
fell downe to the ground: this was his ende, euen at the
handes of his owne subiectes and vassalles agaynst theyr
willes: for the truth is that a Spaniarde helde a Target
ouer his head, wherby they knew him not, nor yet would
beléeue that he was there, for all the signes and tokens
whiche were made vnto them. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> forthwith published
the hurte and daunger of life of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>: some gaue
credite to his tale, and othersome woulde not, but rather
fought very stoutly. Thrée dayes <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> remayned
in extréeme payne, and at the ende departed his life.</p>

<p>And bicause it shoulde appeare that his death was of
the stripe that they had giuen, and not by any hurte receyued
at their hands, he caused two gentlemē of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,
who were prysoners, to carry him out vpon their backes,
who certified the Citizens of the certentie of his death,
that at that presente time were giuyng battery to the
house. But yet for all this they woulde not leaue off the
combat, nor yet the warres, as some of our men thought
they woulde, but rather procéeded on their purpose, with
greater courage and desire of reuenge. And when they retyred,
they made a pityfull lamentation, with preparation
to bury their king in <em class="italic">Chapultepec</em>. On this sorte died <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
who was holden for a God among the <em class="italic">Indians</em>.
Some say that hée desired to be Baptised at the Shrouetide
before his death, and they prolonged the matter, thinking
at Easter followyng to haue christened him with
honour and triumph. But as it happened, it had bene better
to haue done it at that time according to his request.
But with the comming of <em class="italic">Pamfilo de Naruaez</em> the thyng
was also delayed, and after hée was wounded it was
likewyse forgotten, with the troubles that they were in.
It was credibly enformed, that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> was neuer
consentyng to the death of any Spaniarde, nor yet in conspiracie
agaynst <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, but rather loued him entierly: yet
some are of an other opinion, and bothe giue good reasons
to approue their arguments, but the truth could not wel
be knowen, for at that tyme our men vnderstoode not the
language, and agayne <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> after his death, lefte
none to open that secrete.</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">Indians</em> affirme that he was of the greatest bloud
of all his linage, and the greatest kyng in estate, that euer
was in <em class="italic">Mexico</em>. It is also to be noted, that when the
kingdomes do most florish, then are they niest to a chāge,
or else to change their Lorde, as doth appeare in this history
of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>. Our men lost more by y<sup>e</sup> death of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
than the natural <em class="italic">Indians</em>, if we cōsider the murder
and destruction that incontinent did follow. <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
was a man very moderate in his diet, and not so vicious
as other <em class="italic">Indiās</em>, although he had many wiues. He was also
liberal and frée harted: he was estéemed for a very wise
man, in my iudgement he was eyther wise in lettyng
things passe after that sorte, or else a very foole, that did
not vnderstande their doings: he was as deuoute as warlyke,
for he had bene presente in many battayles: it is reported
that he wanne and had victory in nine battayles,
&#38; also other nine times victorie man for man in the fielde,
he reygned seuentene yeares and certaine moneths.</p>

After the death of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> sente
vnto his Neuewes, and to the other noblemen
who mainteyned the warres, desiryng
thē to come and speake with him,
and they came, vnto whome <em class="italic">Cortes</em> spake
from the wall where <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> was
slayne, saying, that it were méete that they should ceasse
from warre, and to chose another king, and also to burie
the dead, and that he woulde come to his buriall as his
friende: likewise he signified vnto them, that for the loue
he bare vnto <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> who had intreated for them, he
had stayed from the finall spoyle of the cittie, &#38; correction
of them for their rebellion and obstinacie. But now that
he had not vnto whome to haue respect, he woulde bothe
burne their houses, and chasten them, if that they submitted
not themselues to his friendship.</p>

<p>They answered, that they woulde neyther leaue the
warres, nor yet estéeme his friēdship, vntill they saw thēselues
in their libertie, and their wrongs wholly reuenged,
yea and that without his counsell they coulde elect
the King vnto whom of right y<sup>e</sup> kingdome did apertaine.
And sithens the Gods hath taken our welbeloued <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
we will giue his body a Sepulchre, as vnto such a
King doth apperteyne: yea and if he would goe and beare
his friend <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> company to the Gods, that then he
should come forth, and they would quickly dispatch him:
and as for the residue, they would haue rather warre thā
peace, yea and that they were not menne that did yéelde
with wordes. Also séeing their King was dead, for whose
respecte they ceassed to burne their houses, rost their bodyes,
and eate their fleshe, but nowe (quoth they) if ye depart
not, we will not dally long time with you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A valiant man.</div>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> finding them stoute and stubborne, liked not the
bargaine. Againe, he knewe well that their meaning
was, that if they hadde departed from the Citie, to haue
spoyled and murthered them by the way. And séeing that
their liues, rule and gouernement consisted in strength of
hand and good courage, he came forth in a morning with
the thrée engines, foure péeces of Ordinance, and fiue hūdred
Spanyards, and thrée thousand <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em>, to fighte
with the enimies, and to burne and spoyle their houses.
They broughte the engines néere vnto certaine greate
houses which stoode néere vnto a bridge, casting theyr
scaling ladders on the walles, and so gote vp to the toppe
where manye people were, and there combated awhile,
but shortly turned to their forte againe, without doing any
greate hurte, with one Spanyarde slayne, and manye
wounded, and also the engines broken and spoyled, yea
the multitude of <em class="italic">Indians</em> were so thicke, and flewe vppon
the Ordinance in suche sorte, that they had no leysure to
discharge them. The stones came also so thicke from the
house toppes, that the engines were soone at an ende. And
the Citizens hauing housed them againe in the forte and
lodging, began to amende the hurt done in their houses,
and to recouer the stréetes that were lost: also y<sup>e</sup> great
Temple, in the Tower whereof, fiue hundred principall
men hadde fortifyed themselues wyth vittayles, stones,
and long Launces, piked with yron and flint stone verye
sharp, but truly they did most hurt with stones. This
Tower was high and strong, as I haue before declared,
and stoode néere vnto the Spanyardes forte, whiche from
that tower receiued muche hurt. Although <em class="italic">Cortes</em> was
somewhat sadde and heauie, yet he ceassed not like a good
Captayne to comfort and encourage his menne, and alwayes
was the firste man at any brunt or assay, and hys
heart coulde not permitte him to remaine penned vp in
that fort, wherefore he toke thrée hundred Spanyardes,
and went to assiege the high tower. Thrée or foure dayes
he ceassed not that enterprise, but coulde not come to the
toppe, being so high a thing, and manye persons in defence
of the same, well prouided, with fitte munition for
the purpose, so that our men came dayly tumbling downe
the stayres, flying to their house with broken pates, so
that our Spanyardes dysmayed more and more, and many
murmured at the matter: you may well iudge howe
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> his heart was afflighted, for the <em class="italic">Indians</em> encreased
still in courage, hauing the better hand, and dayly victory
from the high Tower. But nowe <em class="italic">Cortes</em> determined to
leaue his house, and not to returne therevnto agayne,
vntill he had wonne the Tower. He bounde his Target
to his arme whiche had bin hurt before, and beséeged the
Tower againe with many of his men, <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em> and
other friends, and many times, although they were beaten
downe, arose agayne, succoring one another, tyll at
length they gote to the toppe, and there foughte with the
<em class="italic">Indians</em>, till some of them lept out of the Tower, and stood
hanging vpon the listes of the wall, which were thrée in
number, the one higher than the other, and a foote broad.
Some fell downe to the ground, who besides their falles,
were receyued vpon the swordes poynt, and in this sorte
they left none aliue. Thrée houres they fought on the top
of the Tower, bycause y<sup>e</sup> multitude of <em class="italic">Indians</em> wer great.
In conclusion, the whole fiue hundred men there dyed
very valiantly, and if their weapon and knowledge had
bin equall, the victory had bin doubtfull. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> set fire on
all the Chappels, and other thrée Chappels, where infinite
Idols were, yet those sely <em class="italic">Indians</em> lost no poynte of
courage with the losse of their Temple and Gods, which
touched them at the hearte, but rather began with more
furie to assault the Spanish house.</p>

<em class="italic">Cortez</em> considering the great multitude of <em class="italic">Indians</em>
his enimies, and also the greate courage,
with desire of reuengement: and waying also
how his men were weake and wéeryed with
fight, yet (I may say) with great desire to goe frō thence,
if that the Citizens would haue suffered them: he began
againe to require them with peace, and to desire them of
truce, saying vnto them also, that they should consider,
how that many of their side were slayne, and yet they
coulde kill none of them. They béeing more hard harted
than before, answered that they vtterly refused his offer,
saying, that they neuer woulde haue peace with those
who had slained their men and burned their Gods: yea
(quoth they) and although some of vs are killed, yet wée
also do both kill and hurt, for ye are mortall men, and not
immortall, as we are: beholde ye also the number of vs,
vpon <em class="italic">Zoties</em>, in windowes and stréetes: assure youre
selues there are thrée tymes as manye within the houses.
So wée shall sooner make an ende of you by kyllyng
one and one, than you shall doe of vs by
killing a thousande by thousande, or ten thousand by ten
thousand: for ending all these whome you sée, there wyll
come so many more, and after them so manye more: but
if ye were once killed, there woulde come no more Spanyardes,
yea and when oure weapons can not throughly
destroy you, that then we will sterue you to deathe with
hunger and famine, yea and though nowe you would depart,
it is too late, bycause y<sup>e</sup> bridges are throwen downe,
and the calseys broken, and succoure by water you haue
none. In this communications the daye was spente,
and night at hand, their heads occupyed, and heartes full
heauie, for hunger alone hadde bin ynough to finish theyr
dayes, without any further warre. That nighte, the one
halfe of the number of Spanyardes armed themselues,
and late in the euening came forthe into the Citie. The
<em class="italic">Indiās</em> now being not accustomed to fight at such houres,
the Spanyardes burned aboue thrée hundred houses in
one stréete, and in some of them found many Citizens, of
whome they left not one aliue. They burned and spoyled
thrée <em class="italic">Zoties</em> néere vnto their owne lodging, whiche hadde
greately annoyed them before. The residue of the Spanyardes
whiche abode at home, amended the engins, and
repaired their houses. As this iourney hapned well
vnto them, earely in the morning they procéeded out againe,
and wente to the bridge where their engins hadde
bin broken, and although they founde there greate resistance,
yet the matter imported their liues. They foughte
with noble courage, and gote manye towers, houses and
<em class="italic">Zoties</em>. They wanne also four of the eyght bridges which
were in the Citie, leauing gard in those places whyche
were wonne, returning to their Campe with manye
woundes, beyng both wéery and full of care and sorrow.</p>

<p>The next daye they came forth againe, and wanne the
other foure bridges, and dammed them vp with earth, in
such sorte, that the Horsemen that way followed the enimies
to the firme lande. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> being occupyed in damming
vp the ditches, and making plaine way of the bridges,
there came certayne messengers vnto him, saying,
that néere at hand, abode many noblemen and Captaines
to treate of peace, requiring hym to come vnto them,
praying him to bring <em class="italic">Tlamacazque</em> his prisoner, who was
one of the principallest of the Diuels Cleargie there, to
heare the treatie of the matter.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> wente, and carried the Priest with him, whome
he appoynted to require them to ceasse from contention,
and to remoue their siege, but he came not backe wyth
aunswere. All thys was a fayned fetche, to sée the state
of the Christian Campe, or else to recouer their religious
<em class="italic">Tlamacazque</em>. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> séeyng theyr deceyte, wente hys way
to dinner, and was no sooner sette at hys meate, but certayne
<em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em> came running in with an open crye,
saying, that theyr enimies hadde recouered agayne the
bridges, and wente armed vp and downe the stréetes,
and hadde also slayne the most of the Spanyardes that
were lefte in garde of the bridges. Incontinente <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
wente out with the Horsemenne, who were readyest at
that tyme, and made way through the troupe of enimies,
following them euen vnto the firme lande, but at theyr
returne, the footemen that were hurt and wéeried in kéeping
of the stréete, coulde not susteyne the force and furie
of the infinite number of <em class="italic">Indians</em>, whyche came vpon
them, yea with muche adoe they coulde escape home to
their forte. The multitude was not so greate of <em class="italic">Indians</em>
in the stréete, but also by water in <em class="italic">Canoas</em>, so that stones
flewe on both sydes, and galled oure men cruelly. <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
was hurte in one of hys knées very sore, wherevppon it
was blowen abroade through the Citie, that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> was
slayne, whiche newes dyd greately discourage our men,
and much animate the <em class="italic">Indians</em>. But yet <em class="italic">Cortes</em> for all hys
payne and hurt, ceassed not to embolden &#38; encourage hys
Souldyers, who set afreshe vpon the enimies. At the farthest
bridge fel two Horses, which troubled muche oure
men that followed. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> made suche way among the <em class="italic">Indians</em>,
that the Horsemen hadde reasonable passage, and
béeyng y<sup>e</sup> hindmost man himselfe, he was in great peril of
taking. It was a maruell to sée what a spring hee gaue
with hys Horse, and thereby escaped, but in conclusion,
with stones they were forced to returne to their hold, beyng
very late.</p>

<p>As soone as he had ended his supper, he sente some of
his men to gard the stréete and bridges, and to defend the
same againste the enemie. They were somewhat ioyfull

But <em class="italic">Cortes</em> waying the substance of the
matter, sawe in effecte that his syde wente
to wracke, wherefore he requested hys
menne to departe from thence, who were
not a little ioyfull to heare their Captayne
pronounce that saying, for few or none of them escaped
vnhurt and wounded. They feared death, but yet
wanted not stomacke and hearte to dye. The <em class="italic">Indians</em>
were so many, that if the Chrystians shoulde but onlye
haue cutte their throtes without resistance, yet they
had bin too few for that purpose.</p>

<p>They were also in suche necessitie of bread, that pinched
them sore. Their pouder and shotte was spente, and
almost all other prouision. Their house was welnigh
beaten downe about their eares. All these causes were
sufficient to leaue <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and to séeke to saue their liues:
yet on the other side, they iudged it an euill case, to turne
their backes to their enimies, for (quoth they) the very
stones riseth vp against hym that flyeth. They feared agayne
the passage of the arches where the bridges hadde
bin, so that now they were full besette with sorrow, care,
and misery: but in fyne, they all agréed to departe that
nighte, for many dayes before, one of their companye
called <em class="italic">Botello</em>, who presumed to haue good skyll in the Arte
of Nigromācie, did declare vnto them, that if they would
depart from <em class="italic">Mexico</em> at a certayne houre appoynted, that
then they shuld escape, or else not: but whether they gaue
credite to his sayings or no, they fully determined to departe

they prepared a bridge of tymber to carrie wyth

This is most certayne, they were all priuie and agréede

but it cost them déere, for at their going out of the Citie,
with the waight of their heauie burthens, they coulde
neyther fighte, nor yet make hast on their way, vppon
whiche occasion, the <em class="italic">Indians</em> caught many of them, and
drewe them by the héeles to the slaughterhouse of Sacrifice,
where they were slayne and eaten: yet those that escaped,
had eache of them some profyte, for that pray was
well worth seauen hundred thousand Ducketes: but beeyng
things wrought in greate péeces, they were troublesome
to carrie, so that he whiche carried least, escaped
best. Yet some doe thinke, that there remayned in that
house a great parte of the treasure, but it was not so, for
after our men had taken what they would, then came in
the <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em>, and made spoyle of all the rest.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> gaue charge to certayne of his menne, to garde
with much respecte, a sonne and two daughters of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
<em class="italic">Cacama</em>, and his brother, and manye other greate
Gentlemen his prisoners.</p>

<p>He also appoynted other fortie mē to carrie the bridge
of timber, and other <em class="italic">Indians</em> to carrie the Ordinance,
and a little grayne of <em class="italic">Centli</em> that remayned.</p>

<p>The vantgarde he committed to <em class="italic">Gonsalo de Sandoual</em>,
and <em class="italic">Antonio de Quiniones</em>: and the reregarde he committed
to <em class="italic">Pedro de Aluarado</em>, and he hymselfe remayned
with a hundred men, to vse his discretion. In this order,
and with good deliberation, at midnight he departed from
<em class="italic">Mexico</em> in a darke myst, and so quietely, that none of the
<em class="italic">Indians</em> knewe thereof, commendyng themselues vnto
<em>GOD</em>, beséechyng hym in theyr prayers, to delyuer
them from that presente daunger, and tooke the way of
<em class="italic">Tlacopan</em>, béeyng the same way that he came into the
Citie.</p>

<p>The firste arche whereof the bridge was throwen
downe, they passed with the timber bridge whiche they
carried with them at ease.</p>

<p>In this meane time the watche and espies which warded
in the hiest temples, had descried their flight, and began
to sounde their instruments of warre with a maruelous
crie, saying, they flie, they flie: And sodenly with
this noyse, they hauing no armour to put on, nor other
impedimēt, ioyned an infinite company of them togither,
and followed with greate celeritie, yea and with suche a
heauy and terrible noyse, that all the lake pronounced the
Eccho, saying, let the cursed and wicked be slayne, who
hath done vnto vs such great hurte.</p>

<p>But when <em class="italic">Cortes</em> came to plante his bridge vpon the
second arche of the Cittie, there mette him a greate company
of <em class="italic">Indians</em> to defende the same, yet with much adoe
he planted his bridge and passed thervpon with fiue horsemen
and a hundred Spaniardes, and with them procéeded
through the Calsey to the mayne lande passing many perilous
places, wherein swamme both man and horse, for
the bridge of timber was broken: this done, he lefte his
foote menne on the firme lande, vnder the gouernement
of <em class="italic">Iohn Xaramillo</em>, and returned backe with the fiue horsemen
for to succour and helpe the residue of his company
whiche were behinde. But when he came vnto them, he
found some fighting with great courage, but many slaine.
He lost also his golde and fardage, his ordinance and prisoners,
yea in fine he founde a maruellous change and alteracion
of the estate he lefte them in, wherevpon lyke a
good Captayne he shewed his wisdome and valour, helpyng
and recoueryng as many of his men, as he myght,
and brought them into safetie. He lefte also Captayne
<em class="italic">Aluarado</em> to succour the reste.</p>

<p>But <em class="italic">Aluarado</em> with all his power and strength could
not resiste the fury of the enimies, wherefore with the
Lance in his hande he beganne to flie, seyng the greate
slaughter of his company, so that hée was forced to passe
ouer the dead carkases, yea and vpon some that were not
throughly dead, who made a lamentable, pytifull, and
dolefull mone. And commyng to the next arche, whose
brydge was broken downe, of necessitie he tooke hys
Lance, and therewith leaped such a space, that the <em class="italic">Indians</em>
were amased to sée, for none of his fellowes could doe
the like, although they approued the enterprise, and were
drowned for their labour.</p>

<p>When <em class="italic">Cortes</em> sawe this sorrowfull sight, he sate hym
downe, not to take any rest for his wearinesse, but only to
bewayle the dead men, yea and also them that were aliue
and in greate daunger, and also to ponder the vnstedfastnesse
of cruell fortune in the perdition of so many his
friends, such great treasure and lordshippe, so greate a Citie
and Kingdome, but also to bewayle the sorrowfull
estate that he himself stoode in, seyng the moste of his
men wounded &#38; hurte, and knowyng not whyther to goe,
for that he was not certayne of the helpe and friendship
of <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em>. Yea and what harde hart, woulde not haue
relented to behold the dead bodies, who a litle before had
entred that same way, with suche magnificall triumphe,
pompe and pleasure. But yet hauing care of those whom
he had lefte on the firme lande, he made haste to <em class="italic">Tlacopan</em>.</p>

<p>This sorowfull night, which was the tenth of July in
<em class="italic">An</em> .1520. were slaine aboute .450. Spaniardes, 4000. <em class="italic">Indian</em>
friends, and .46. horse, yea &#38; (as I iudge) all the prisoners
which were in his company. If this mishap had fortuned
in the day time, possible so many and so great a nūber
had not perished. But where it fortuned by night, the
noyse of the wounded was sorrowful, &#38; of the victors horrible
and feareful. The <em class="italic">Indians</em> cried victory, calling vpon
their diuelish and filthy Goddes with ioy &#38; pleasure, our
men being ouercome, cursed their vnfortunate lot, yea the
hower, and he that brought them thither, others cried vnto
God for succour, others sayd helpe, help, for I stande in
daūger of drowning. I know not certenly whether moe
perished in the water or the lande, hopyng to saue themselues
by swimming and leapyng ouer the sluces and broken
places, for they say, that a Spaniarde was no sooner
in the water, but an <em class="italic">Indian</em> was vppon his backe. They
haue great dexteritie &#38; skill in swimming, so that catching
any Spaniarde in the water, they would take him by
the one arme, and carrie him whither they pleased, yea &#38;
would vnpanch him in the water. If these <em class="italic">Indians</em> had not
occupied themselues in taking the spoyle of those that
were fallen and slaine, certenly one Christian had not escaped
that day: but in fine, the greatest number of Spaniardes
that were killed, were those that went moste laden
with golde plate and other iewels, &#38; those which escaped,
were they that carried least burdens, &#38; the first that with
noble courage made way to passe through the troupe of
<em class="italic">Indians</em>.</p>

<p>Nowe wée may safely say, that the couetous desire
of gold, wherof they had plenty, was cause of their death,
and they may answere that they died riche. After that
those, whiche had escaped, were paste the calsey, the <em class="italic">Indians</em>
stayed and followed them no further, eyther for that
they contented themselues with that whiche they had
done, or else they durst not fight in open fields: But principally
it is thought, that they abode to mourne and lament
for the death of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> his chyldren, not knowing
till then their sorrowfull ende. But nowe seyng the
thyng present before their eyes, they wrang theyr hands,
and made a pitifull dole and crie, and the rather, bycause
they themselues had slayne them against their willes.</p>

The Inhabitants of <em class="italic">Tlacopan</em>, knewe not
how our men came spoyled, hurte, and ouerthrowen,
and againe our men stoode
in a maze, and knew not what to doe nor
whither to goe. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> came vnto them, &#38;
cōforted them &#38; placed them in order before
him, requyring them to make hast, vntill they might
come into the broade field, before such tyme as the men of
<em class="italic">Tlacopan</em> should heare of the newes passed, &#38; so to arme thēselues
and to ioyne with fourtie thousande <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>, who
after the mournyng for their friends, came marchyng after
them. He placed in the vantgard the <em class="italic">Indians</em> his friēds,
and passed through certayne tilled grounde, and continually
fought as they went, vntill they came to a high hill,
where was a tower and a Temple, whiche is called our
Lady churche at this day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A vvery iourney.</div>

<p>The <em class="italic">Indians</em> slewe some of the Spaniardes whiche
came in the reregard, and many of their <em class="italic">Indian</em> friends, before
they could get vp to the toppe of the hill. They loste
muche of the golde, that had remayned, and with greate
hazarde escaped through the multitude of <em class="italic">Indians</em> with
life, their horses whiche remayned aliue, were foure and
twentie, who were tyred both with trauell and hunger, &#38;
the Spaniardes their maisters, with the residue coulde
scarsely stirre hande or foote with wearinesse of fightyng,
and penurie of hunger, for al that day and night they ceassed
not from fight, eating nothing at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A payneful man.</div>

<p>In this Temple were reasonable lodgings, where
they fortified themselues as well as they myght, and
dranke one to an other, but theyr supper was very slēder.
After their simple feast was ended, they went and beheld
an infinite number of <em class="italic">Indians</em>, whiche had beset them almost
round about, makyng a maruellous shoute and crie,
knowyng that they were without victuals, whiche onely
is a warre worser than to fight with the enimie. They
made many fires with the woodde of sacrifice, rounde about
the tower and Temple, &#38; with this pollicie, at midnight
departed secretely. It happened that they had <em class="italic">Tlaxcalteca</em>
to be their guide, who knew well the way, assuring
to bring them into the iurisdiction of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>: with this
guide they began to iourney. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> placed his wounded
men and fardage in the middest of his company, the souldiours
that were whole and in health, he deuided into the
vantgarde &#38; reregarde: he could not passe so secretly, but y<sup>t</sup>
they were espied by the <em class="italic">Indian</em> scoute, whiche was neare
at hand, who gaue aduise therof incōtinent. Fiue horsemē
which went before to discouer, fell among certayne cōpanies
of <em class="italic">Indians</em>, which attended their cōming to robbe thē,
&#38; seing the horsemen, they suspected that the whole army
was at hand, whervpon they fled, but yet seing them few
in number stāde and ioyned with the other <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> that
followed &#38; pursued our men thrée leagues vntil they came
to a hill where was an other temple with a good tower &#38;
lodgyng, where they lodged that night without supper.
They departed in the mornyng from thence, and wente
through a cragged &#38; naughty way, to a great towne the
enhabitantes whereof were fledde for feare, so that they
abode there two daies to rest thēselues, to cure their mē,
&#38; horses: also they somewhat eased their hūgery stomakes
and carried frō thence prouision, although not muche, for
they had none to carrie it. And being departed frō thence,
many enimies pursued them &#38; persecuted them very sore.
Likewise y<sup>e</sup> guide erred out of his way, &#38; at lēgth came to
a little village of few houses, where they reposed y<sup>e</sup> night.
In the morning they procéeded vpon their way, and the
enimies still pursuyng and troubled them sore all the day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cortes vvounded vvith a slyng.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Oh noble Cortez.</div>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> was woūded with the stripe of a sling, and therewith
was in greate daunger of life, for his head so rancbled,
that of necessitie they were forced to take out certaine
péeces of his skull, whervpon he was driuen to séeke
a solitarie place in the wildernesse to cure him, and in
goyng thitherwardes, the enimies wounded fiue Spaniardes
and foure horses, whereof one died, and that was
eaten among them for a sumptuous supper, and yet not
sufficient for them all, for there was none of them whiche
were not vexed with hunger. I speake not of their
woundes and wearinesse, things sufficient to haue made
an ende of lyfe. But certainely the Spanishe nation can
abide more hunger than any other, and especially these
with <em class="italic">Cortes</em> dyd shewe the proofe. The nexte day in the
mornyng departing from a litle Village, and fearyng the
multitude of enimies, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> commaunded eche horseman
to take a sicke manne behinde him, and those that were
somewhat stronger, to holde by the horse tayles and stirroppes:
he likewise made cruches for other some to ease
them, and woulde not leaue one of his men behinde him
to be a pray and supper for the <em class="italic">Indian</em> enimies. This aduise
was very profitable as things fell out, yea also there
were some of them that carried vpon their backe their
fellowes, &#38; thereby were saued. They had not iourneyed
a full league into a playne fielde, when there mette them
an infinite number of <em class="italic">Indians</em> who compassed them round
aboute, and assaulted our men in such sorte, that they verily
beléeued that day to ende generally their liues, for
there were many <em class="italic">Indians</em> that durst wrastell with our
men, man to man, yea and layd some of them in the duste,
and drewe them by the héeles, whether it were with the
great courage whiche they had, or whether it were with
the trauayle, hunger and hurtes of our men I know not,
but great pittie it was to sée, how they were drawen by
the <em class="italic">Indian</em> enimies, and what grieuous mone they made.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oh valiant Cortez.</div>

<div class="sidenote">200000. Indians.</div>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> that wente with vigilant care comfortyng his
men, as muche as was possible to doe, and well perusing
the great daunger that they were in, commendyng himselfe
to God, sette spurres to his horse and made way thorow
the greatest troupe of <em class="italic">Indians</em>, and came vnto the
captayne generall who bare the Royall standart of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,
and passed him through with his Lance, whereof he
incontinent died. But when the <em class="italic">Indians</em> sawe the standart
fallen, they threw their auncient on the grounde and fled,
scattering them here and there like men amazed, knowing
not whither to fly, for such is their custome in warre,
that when they sée the generall slayne, they forthwith
leaue the fielde. Then our wery soules began to recouer
hart and strength, and the horsemen followed thē to their
great anoyance and slaughter. It was credibly reported,
that there were that day in fielde .200000. <em class="italic">Indians</em>. And the
fielde where this battayle was fought is called <em class="italic">Otumpan</em>:
there was neuer a more notable facte done in <em class="italic">India</em>, nor
greater victorie since the first discouery of the same. And
as manye Spaniardes as sawe <em class="italic">Hernando Cortes</em> fighte
that day, did holde opinion, that neuer one man did more
greater feates in armes, and that he only was the meane
in his owne person to saue and deliuer them all.</p>

After this victory obtayned, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> with his
company went to lodge in a house planted
alone, in a playne grounde, from whence
appeared the Mountaynes of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>,
whereof our menne muche reioyced: yet
on the other side they stoode in doubt whether they should
finde them their friendes in such a daungerous season, for
bycause the vnfortunate man that flieth, findeth nothing
in his fauour, for all thing that he pretendeth, happeneth
cleane contrary. That night <em class="italic">Cortes</em> himselfe was scoute,
not bycause he was more whole than his fellowes, but
like a good Captayne, he deuided the trauayle &#38; paynes equally,
euen as their hurte and damage was come.</p>

<div class="sidenote">50000. mē.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Faythfull friendes.</div>

<p>Being day, they iourneyed in plaine and straight way,
directly to the Mountaynes and Prouince of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>,
they passed by a swéete foūtaine of water, where they wel
refreshed themselues, and after they came to <em class="italic">Huazilipan</em>, a
towne of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, of .4000. housholdes, where they were
louingly receiued &#38; abundantly prouided for thrée dayes,
whiche they abode there refreshing &#38; curing their weary
bodies. Some of the townes men would giue thē nothing
without payment, but the moste parte did vse them very
gently: Vnto this Towne came <em class="italic">Maxixca</em>, <em class="italic">Xicotencatlh</em>,
<em class="italic">Axotecalth</em>, and many other principall persons of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>,
and <em class="italic">Huexozinca</em> with .50000. men of warre, who were
going to <em class="italic">Mexico</em> to succour the Spaniardes, knowyng of
their troubles, but not of their hurte and spoyle, yet some
holde opinion that they hauyng certayne knowledge of
all theyr mishappes and flight from <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, came only to
comforte them, and in the name of all theyr communaltie
and state, to offer them their Towne, in conclusion,
they séemed sorrowfull for their misfortunes, and agayne
ioyfull to sée them there: Yea some of them with
anguishe of harte wepte, and sayde, wée did aduise and
warne yée, that the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> were Traytours and wicked
persons, and yet yée woulde not beléeue vs: wée doe
pyttie and bewayle your troubles, but if it please you,
lette vs goe thither to reuenge your iniuries, and the
death of your Christians, and our Citizens: and if now ye
will not, that then it may please you to goe with vs home
to our houses, for to recreate youre persons, and to cure
your woundes.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> did cordially reioyce, to heare and finde such succour
and friendship, in such good men of warre, whereof
he stoode in doubt as he came thitherward. He gaue them
most hartie thankes for their louing offer, curtesie, and
good will. He gaue vnto them of such Iewels as remayned,
and sayd vnto them, the time will come, that I shall
desire your helpe against the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>, but now presently
it is néedefull, to cure my sicke and wounded men.</p>

<p>The noble men that were there present, besought him
to giue them leaue to skirmish with the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Culhua</em>,
for as yet many of them wandered there aboute. <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
graunted their request, and sente with them some of hys
men, which were lustie, and in good health, who procéeded
forth all togither, and in that iourney slewe many <em class="italic">Indian</em>
enimies, so that after this time, the enimies appeared no
more. Then with triumph, pleasure, and victory, they departed
toward the Citie, and oure men followed. It is
credibly reported, that twenty thousande men and women
met them by the way with sundry kindes of meates:
I do beléeue that the most of them came to sée them, for
the great loue whiche they bare vnto them, and likewise
to enquire of their friends which had gone with them to
<em class="italic">Mexico</em>, of whome few returned. In <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em> they were
honorable receyued, and well vsed. <em class="italic">Maxixca</em> gaue hys
house to <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, and the residue of hys company were hosted
at Gentlemens houses, who cherished them excéedingly,
whereby they forgate the paynes, sorrowes, and
trauels past, for in fiftéene dayes before, they lay on the
bare ground.</p>

<p>Certaynely the Spanyardes were muche indebted to
the <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em>, for their loyaltie and faithfull friendship,
especially vnto that good and vertuous Gentleman <em class="italic">Maxixca</em>,
who threwe <em class="italic">Xicotencatl</em> downe the stayres and
steppes of the chiefe Temple, for giuing his counsell to
kyll the Spanyardes, meaning to reconcile hymselfe
with the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>.</p>

<p>He also made two Orations, the one to the men, and
the other to the women, in the greate fauoure and prayse
of the Spanyardes, putting them in remembrance, howe
that they hadde not eaten salt, nor worne cloth of cotten
wooll in many yeares before, vntil now that their friends
were come: and to this day these <em class="italic">Indians</em> doe muche presume
of their fidelitie, and likewise of the resistance and
battayle they made with <em class="italic">Cortes</em> in <em class="italic">Teoacazinco</em>, so that
now when they celebrate any great feast, or receyue any

was turned to sorrowe, not onely for the golde and treasure
so muche, as for the losse of his menne, fearyng also

This newes and answere pleased <em class="italic">Cortes</em> and all his company,

deliuer vs aliue, to be eaten, and sacrificed, for it is an
olde rule, that friendship dothe not long endure betwixte
them that are of sundry religion, apparell, and spéech.</p>

<p>After all these complayntes and murmurations amōg
themselues, they made a protestation and request, in
forme as it were in the name of the King and all the
company, praying him incontinent to departe frō thence,
and to goe with them to the Towne of <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em>, before
the enimies mighte disturbe their way and passage, and
then they to remayne both bought and solde, and shutte
vp as it were in a prison: also they declared, that in <em class="italic">Vera
Crux</em> they should haue better opportunitie to make themselues
strong, if that he meante to returne agayne vpon
<em class="italic">Mexico</em>, or else to take shipping, if so it shoulde séeme conuenient.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> hearing this request, and determination of hys
Souldyers, was at his wits ende, ymagining that theyr
pretence was, onely to procure him to goe from thence,

My maisters, I would do and fulfill youre
request, if it were a thing méete and conueniente
for you, for there is not one alone
of you, how much more all in generall,
for whome I shoulde not willingly
aduenture my goodes and life, if he shuld
néede the same: for why? your deedes haue bin such, that I
stand bound neuer to forget thē, or else to shewe my selfe
an ingratefull man. And thinke you not good friendes, although
I do not fulfill the thing whiche you so earnestly
desire, that therefore I estéeme not youre authoritie: but
in not graunting to the same, I do exalt and estéeme you
in greater reputation: for why? in oure departing nowe
from hence, oure honor is blotted and stayned for euermore,
and in abiding héere, we shall like valiant menne
preserue the same. What nation is there, that had rule,
dominon, and Empire in this world, that hath not bin ouercome
at some time? What famous Captayne returned
home to his house, for the losse of one battayle? none
truly, for he that dothe not perseuer, shall neuer triumph
with Lady Victory: he that retyreth, sheweth that he flyeth,
and remayneth a mockingstocke for all men: but hée
that sheweth nobly his face, dothe vtter the courage of
his heart, yea and is both feared, and also beloued.</p>

<p>If we now should depart from hence, these our friēds
would accept and iudge vs for cowardes, and refuse perpetually
our friendship. Likewise oure enimies woulde
iudge the same, and neuer héereafter stande in feare of
vs, which shoulde be a greate shame vnto oure estimation.
Is there any amōg vs, that would not holde himselfe
affrented, if it shoulde be sayde, that he turned his backe
and fledde, how much more would it be a dishonor for vs
all to haue the same report?</p>

<p>I doe much maruell at the greatenesse of your inuincible
heartes in battell: you were wont to be desirous of
warres, and nowe that suche iust and laudable warre
doth offer it selfe, you doe feare and refuse the same: sure
it is a thing cleane contrary to oure nature. What is hée
that will prate of harnes, and neuer ware none? It was
neuer yet séene in all this <em class="italic">India</em> and new world, that any
of our nation retired with feare. And woulde you nowe
that it should be said, that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> and his company fledde,
being in securitie, and without perill or daunger? I beséech
God not to permitte any suche thing. The warres
doe muche consist in fame: why then? what better thyng
would you desire, than to be héere in <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em> in despite
of all youre enimies, yea proclayming open warres againste
them, and they not dare to annoy vs? Therefore
you may well consider, that héere you are more sure than
if you were from hence, so that héere in <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em> you are
honored with securitie and strength, and besides this, you
haue al things necessary for phisick and medicine to cure
youre woundes and obteyne your health: yea, and I am
bolde to saye, that if you were in youre owne naturall
Coūtrey, you should not haue the like, nor yet be so much
made off.</p>

<p>I do nowe meane to send for our men that are in <em class="italic">Coazacoalco</em>
and <em class="italic">Almeria</em>, and so we shall haue a reasonable
army: yea and although they come not, wée are sufficient,
for we were fewer in number when first we entred into
thys Countrey, hauyng no friendes: and likewise you
knowe well, it is not the number that doth fighte, but the
couragious hearte and minde. I haue séene one of you
discomfyte a whole army, as <em class="italic">Ionathas</em> did, yea and many
among you haue had victory against a thousand, yea ten
thousand <em class="italic">Indians</em>, as King <em class="italic">Dauid</em> had againste the <em class="italic">Philistines</em>.
I looke dayly for Horses from the Ilandes, and
other armoure and artillerie we shall haue from <em class="italic">Vera
Crux</em>. And as for vittayles, take you no care, for I wyll
prouide you abundantly, for they are thinges that alwayes
followe the Conqueroures: and as for these
Citizens of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, I binde my selfe that you shall
finde them trustie, loyall, and perpetuall friendes, for so
they haue promised me vppon their solemne othes, yea,
and if they had meante otherwise, what better opportunitie
of time could they haue wished, thā these latter dayes,
where as we lay sicke in their owne beddes and houses,
yea some of vs lame, wounded, and in manner rotten,
and they like louing friendes haue not only holpen you,
but also serued you with diligence of seruantes, for they
woulde rather choose to be your slaues, than subiectes to
the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>: theyr hatred is suche to them, and their
loue so great to you. And bycause you shall sée the troth,
I will now proue them and you, againste these of <em class="italic">Tepeacac</em>,
who slewe of late dayes twelue Spanyardes. And if
this iourney happen euill, then will I followe youre request,
and if it please God that it happen well, then wyll
I entreate and pray you to follow my counsell.</p>

<p>The Souldyers hearing this comfortable speeche, began
to lay aside their desire to goe from thence to <em class="italic">Vera
Crux</em>. They aunswered generally, that they woulde obey
his commaundemente, it shoulde séeme with the promise
made, touching the successe of the victory in <em class="italic">Tepeacac</em>,
and lightly seldome it happeneth, that a Spanyard saith
no, when he is required to goe on warfare, for it is holden
for a dishonor and shame.</p>

<em class="italic">Cortez</em> found himselfe at hearts ease with this
answere, for it was a thing y<sup>t</sup> had much troubled
him: &#38; vndoubtedly if he had followed his
fellowes demand, he shoulde neuer haue recouered
<em class="italic">Mexico</em> agayne, &#38; they likewise had bin slayne in the
way towards <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em>, for they hadde manye perilous
places to passe. Eache one of them waxed whole of his
wounds, sauing some which dyed for wāt of loking to in
time, leauing their wounds filthy &#38; vnbound, as Surgiōs
doe affirme, with also their great trauell &#38; weakenesse.
And likewise other some remayned lame and halt, which
was no small griefe and losse: but the most parte recouered
healthe, as I haue declared. After twenty dayes
fully past, whiche they had abode in <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> determined
to make warre with the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Tepeacac</em>,
which is a greate Towne, and not farre from thence, for
they hadde slayne twelue Spanyards, whiche came from
<em class="italic">Vera Crux</em> towardes <em class="italic">Mexico</em>. Likewise they were of the
league of <em class="italic">Culhua</em>, and therfore were holpen by the
<em class="italic">Mexicans</em>,
and did many times great hurt to the inhabitantes
of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, as <em class="italic">Xicotencatl</em> did testifye.
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> desired hys
louing friende <em class="italic">Maxixca</em>, and diuers other Gentlemen, to
goe with him, who forthwith entred into counsell wyth
the states and comunaltie of the Citie, and there determined
with generall consente to gyue vnto him fortie
thousand fighting men, besides many <em class="italic">Tamemoz</em>, who are
foote carriers, to beare the baggage, victuall, and other
things. With this number of <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em>, his owne men
and horses, he wente to <em class="italic">Tepeacac</em>, requiring them in satisfaction
of the death of y<sup>e</sup> twelue Christiās that they shuld
now yéelde themselues to the obedience of the Emperor,
and that héereafter neuer more to receiue any <em class="italic">Mexican</em>
into theyr towne or houses, neyther yet any of the prouince
of <em class="italic">Culhua</em>.</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">Tepeacacs</em> answered, that they had slaine the Spaniardes
for good and iuste cause, whiche was, that being
tyme of warre they presumed to passe through their countrey
by force, without their will and licence. And also
that the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> and <em class="italic">Culhuacans</em> were their friendes and
Lordes, whom alwayes they would friendly entertayne
within their towne and houses, refusing vtterly their offer
and request, protesting to giue no obedience to whom
they knew not, wishyng them therefore, to returne incontinent
to <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, excepte they had desire to ende their
werie dayes.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> innuited them diuers times with peace, and seing
it preuailed not, he begā his warres in earnest. Their
enimies lykewise with the fauour of the <em class="italic">Culhuacans</em> were
braue and lustie, and began to stoppe and defend their pretended
entraunce. And they beyng many in number, with
diuers valiant men among them, began to skirmishe sundry
times, but at the end, they were ouerthrowen, and many
slayne, without killing any Spaniarde, although many
<em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em> were killed that day.</p>

<p>The Lordes and principall persons of <em class="italic">Tepeacac</em> seyng
theyr ouerthrow, and that their strength coulde not preuayle,
yéelded themselues vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em> for vassalles of the
Emperour, with condition to banish for euer their allied
friendes of <em class="italic">Culhua</em>. And that he should punishe and correct
at his will and pleasure, all those whiche were occasion
of the death of the twelue Spaniardes. For which causes
and obstinacie, at the firste <em class="italic">Cortes</em> iudged by his sentence,
that all the townes whiche had bene priuie to the murder,
should for euer remaine captiues and slaues: others affirme
that he ouercame them without any condition, and
corrected them for their disobedience, being Sodomites,
idolaters and eaters of mans flesh, and chiefly for exāple
of all others. And in conclusion, they were condemned for
slaues, and within twenty daies that these warres lasted,
he pacified all that prouince, which is very great: he draue
from thēce the <em class="italic">Culhuacans</em>: he threw downe the idols, and
the chiefest persons obeyed him. And for more assuraunce
he builte there a towne, naming it <em class="italic">Segura de la Frontera</em>: he
appoynted all officers for the purpose, being a towne situated
in the high way from <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em> to <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, whereby
the Christians and straungers mighte passe without
daunger. In these warres serued lyke faithfull friendes
the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, <em class="italic">Huexocinco</em> and <em class="italic">Cholalla</em>, promysing
the lyke seruice and succour agaynst <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, yea and
rather better than worse. With this victory the Spaniardes
recouered great fame, for they were thought to
haue bene slayne.</p>

After all these things were finished, <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
cōmaunded &#38; gaue licence to al the <em class="italic">Indian</em>
friēds, to returne home vnto their houses,
except his assured friends of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, whō
he kept in his company for the warres of
<em class="italic">Mexico</em>: he nowe dispatched a poste to <em class="italic">Vera
Crux</em>, commaundyng that foure of the shippes which <em class="italic">Naruaez</em>
had brought, should be sent with al spéede to y<sup>e</sup> Iland
of <em class="italic">Santo Domingo</em>, for men, horses, armour, pouder &#38; other
munition, also for wollen cloth, linnen, shooes, and many
other things: and wrote his letters for the same to the licenciat
<em class="italic">Rodrigo de Figueroa</em>, and to the whole magistrates
of Chancery, certifying them of all their procéedings in
that countrey; beséechyng them of helpe and succour, and
that forthwith to be sent by the messenger.</p>

<p>This done, he sente twentie horsemen, twoo hundred
Spaniardes, and many <em class="italic">Indians</em> vnto <em class="italic">Zacatami</em> and <em class="italic">Xalaxinco</em>,
whiche were townes subiect to the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>, and placed
in the high way to <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em>, who had slayne certaine
Spaniardes passyng that way. This company wente
thither, with their accustomed protestations, whiche preuayled
not, wherevpon followed fire and spoyle: many
Gentlemen and other principall persons came to yéelde
themselues to <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, more for feare than for good will,
crauyng pardon for theyr offence, promising also not to
offende agayne, nor yet at any tyme to take armour agaynst
the Spaniardes. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> pardoned them, &#38; then hys
armie returned, with determination to kéepe his Christmasse
in <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, whiche was within twelue dayes followyng.
He left a Captaine with thrée score Spaniards
in the newe towne of <em class="italic">Segura</em>, to kéepe that passage, and also
to put in feare the <em class="italic">Comarcans</em> that dwelled thereabout:
he sente before him his whole armie, and he himself went
with twentie horsemen from thence to <em class="italic">Coliman</em> to lodge
there that night, being a cittie of his allied friendes, and
there to ordaine and make by hys auctoritie, bothe Noble
men and Captaynes in lue of them whiche died with the
disease of small pockes. He aboade there thrée dayes, in
the whiche the newe Lordes were ordeyned, who afterwardes
remayned his especiall friendes. The nexte day
hée came <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, beyng sixe leagues distant from
thence, where he was triumphantly receyued. And truely
at that time he made a iourney most worthie of renowne
and glory.</p>

<p>At this season his déere friende <em class="italic">Maxixca</em> was departed
this transitorie lyfe, for whome he mourned clothed
in blacke, after the Spanishe fashion: he lefte behinde him
certaine sonnes, of whom the eldest was .xij. yéeres of age,
whome <em class="italic">Cortes</em> named and appoynted for Lorde of his fathers
estate, and the commons did certifie it to appertaine
vnto him. This was no small glory for <em class="italic">Cortes</em> to giue
estates, and also to take them away at his pleasure, yea
and that those <em class="italic">Indians</em> should haue him in suche feare and
respect, that none durste doe any thyng in acceptyng the
inheritaunce of their fathers without his good will and
licence.</p>

<p>Now <em class="italic">Cortes</em> procured that euery man shoulde make his
harneys, weapons and prouision readie and in good order:
he made also great haste in building Vergantines, for his
timber was already cutte and seasoned: he sente vnto
<em class="italic">Vera Crux</em> for sayles, tacle, nayles, roapes and other necessarie
things, whereof there was store remaynyng of
the furniture of the shippes that were sunke. And hauyng
wante of pitche, for in that countrey the <em class="italic">Indians</em> knewe not
what it meant, he commaunded certayne of his Mariners
to make the same in the highe Mountaynes where was
store of Pine trées, and not farre from the cittie.</p>

The fame of prosperitie whiche <em class="italic">Cortes</em> enioyed,
was wonderfully blowen abroade
with the newes of the imprisonment of
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, and the victory against <em class="italic">Pamfilo
de Naruaez</em>, wherevppon there came
many Spaniardes by twenty and twentie
in a company from <em class="italic">Cuba</em>, <em class="italic">Santo Domingo</em>, and other Ilandes.
Although that iourney coste some their liues, for
in the way they were murdered by those of <em class="italic">Tepeacac</em> and
<em class="italic">Xalacinco</em>, as is before declared, yet notwithstanding there
came many to <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, whereby his hoste was muche
encreased, beséechyng him to make haste towarde the
warres.</p>

<p>It was not possible for <em class="italic">Cortes</em> to haue espies in <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,
for the <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em> were knowen by their lippes, eares,
and other tokens, and also they had in <em class="italic">Mexico</em> garde and
greate enquirie for that purpose, by reason wherof he could
not certainely knowe what passed in those parties, accordyng
as he desired, for to haue prouided himself of things
néedefull: yet a Captayne whiche was taken prysoner in
<em class="italic">Huacacholla</em>, certified that <em class="italic">Cuetlauac</em> Lorde of <em class="italic">Iztacpalapan</em>,
Neuewe to <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>, was elected Emperour after his
Vncles death, who was a wise and valiant man, and hée
it was that had dryuen <em class="italic">Cortes</em> out of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, who now had
fortified <em class="italic">Mexico</em> with many bulworkes and caues, and
with many and sundry sortes of weapon, but chiefly very
long Lances, yea and planted them in the grounde to
resiste and molest the horsemen. He proclaymed pardon
and frée libertie, without paying any tribute for the space
of one whole yéere, yea and further as long as the warres
should laste, he promysed also great rewardes to all them
that shoulde kill any Christian, or expulse them from that
countrey. This was a policie whereby he gatte muche
credite among his vassals, yea and gaue them greate courage
to play the valiant men. All this newes was founde
to be true, sauyng onely <em class="italic">Cuetlauac</em> was dead. And that
<em class="italic">Quahutimoccin</em>, Neuew also, as some doe say, of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>,
raygned at that tyme, who was a valiant man and a good
warrier, as hereafter shalbe declared, who sente his messengers
through out his Empyre, proclaymyng as great
rewardes as <em class="italic">Cuetlauac</em> had done before, declaryng vnto
them that it was more reason to serue him than straungers,
and also to defende theyr olde auncient Religion,
and not to credite suche Christians as woulde make
themselues Lordes of other mens goodes, yea and make
them slaues and captiues as they had done in other places.
<em class="italic">Quahutimoc</em> encouraged muche his subiectes, and
kindled with his talke their wrath agaynst the Spaniards:
yet there were some prouinces that gaue no eare to
his information, but rather leaned to our side, or else medled
with neyther side. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> seyng the effect of the matter,
determined forthwith to beginne the warres: he mustered
his men on Sainct Steuens day, and founde fourtie
horsemen, and fiue hundreth &#38; fourtie footemen, wherof
foure score were Hargabushiers, and crossebow men,
niene péeces of ordinaunce, and little powder: his horsemen
he diuided into foure squares, and his footemen into
nine: he named &#38; appointed captaynes, and other officers

My louyng brethren, I gyue moste hartie
thankes vnto Iesu Christ, to sée you now
whole of your woundes and frée from diseases:
likewise I muche reioyce to sée you
in good order trimly armed, yea and with
suche desire to sette agayne vpon <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, to reuenge the
death of our fellowes, and to winne that greate Citie, the
whiche I truste in God shalbe brought to passe in shorte
time, hauing the friendship of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em> and other prouinces,
who haue as great desire to sée the ouerthrowe of
the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>, as we our selues, for therein they gette both
honour, libertie &#38; safegarde of life. Also it is to be considered,
that if the victory should not be ours, they poore soules
should be destroyed and remaine in perpetuall captiuitie.
Also the <em class="italic">Culhuacans</em> do abhorre them worse than vs, for
receyuing vs into their houses and countrey: therefore
sure I am that they will sticke vnto vs vnfaynedly. I
muste néedes confesse their vnfayned friendship, for presente
workes doe testifie the same. They will not onely
be a meane to bryng others their neyghbours to our seruice,
but also haue now in readinesse .100000. mē of warre,
to sende with vs, besides a great nūber of <em class="italic">Tamemez</em> or carriers
to carrie al our prouision. Ye also, are now the same
which alwaies heretofore ye haue bene, for I as witnesse
beying your captayne, haue had the victory of many battayles
fighting with a .100. yea &#38; 200000. enimies: we got
also by strength of arme many strōg cities, yea &#38; brought
in subiection many prouinces, not beyng so many in number
as we are nowe, for when we came firste into this
countrey we were not so many as now presently we are.
Agayne in <em class="italic">Mexico</em> they feare our cōing: it should also be
a blot vnto our honour that <em class="italic">Quahutimoc</em> should inherite y<sup>e</sup>
kingdome that cost our friēd <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> his life. Likewise
I esteme al that we haue done is nothing, if we winne not
<em class="italic">Mexico</em>, our victories shoulde also be sorowfull if we reuenge
not the death of our déere fellowes. The chiefe and
principall cause of our cōming into this countrey, was to
set forth the faith of Iesu Christ, &#38; therwithal doth folow
honour &#38; profite which seldome times do dwell togither.
In those fewe dayes that we were in <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, we put
downe the idols, we caused sacrifice and eatying of mans
fleshe to bée layde aside, and also in those dayes wée beganne
to conuerte some to the fayth. It is not therefore
nowe reason to leaue of so laudable an enterpryse, so
well begonne. Lette vs now goe whither holy fayth doth
call vs, and where the sinnes of our enimies deserueth
so great a punishment, and if yée well remember, the Citizens
of that citie were not cōtent to murder such an infinite
number of men, women &#38; children before the idols,
in their filthy sacrifice, for honour of their Diuelishe
Goddes, but also to eate their fleshe, a thyng inhumayne,
and much abhorred of God, and al good men doth procure,
and especially Christians, to defende and punishe suche
odious customes.</p>

<p>Besides all this, they committe that horrible sinne for
the whiche the fiue cities with <em class="italic">Sodom</em> were burned by fire
from heauen: Why then what greater occasion should
any man wishe for in earth, than to abolish such wickednesse,
and to plant among these bloudy tirants the fayth
of Iesu Christ, publishing his holy gospel? Therfore now,
with ioyfull hartes lette vs procéede to serue God, honour
our nation, to enlarge our Princes dominions, and to enriche
our selues with the goodly pray of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, to morrow
God willyng we will beginne the same.</p>

<p>All his men answeared with chéerefull countenaunce,
that they were ready to departe when it pleased him, promising
their faithful seruice vnto him. It should séeme the

whiche they had eyght moneths enioyed before.</p>

you know the iourney which I haue nowe in hande, to
morrowe God willing I will departe to the warre and
siege of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and enter into the land of youre enimies
and mine: And the thing that now I do require, and also
pray, is, that you remayne faithfull and constant in your

trust you will continue. And bycause I can not bring so
soone my purpose to passe according to youre desire and
mine, without the <em class="italic">Vergantines</em> which are now a making,
and to be placed in the lake of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, therefore I praye
you to fauoure these workemen whiche I leaue héere,

done and to giue them all things necessary for their prouision,
and I do faithfully promise to take away the yoke

vpon you, and also will obteyne of the Emperoure great
libertie and priuiledges for you.</p>

<p>All the <em class="italic">Indians</em> shewed countenance of obedience, and

<em class="italic">Cortez</em> departed from <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em> wyth hys
Souldyers in good order, whyche was a
goodly sight to beholde, for at that time he
had eyghtie thousand men in his host, and
the most of them armed after their manner,
which made a gallant shew: but <em class="italic">Cortes</em> for diuers causes
would not haue them all with him, vntill the <em class="italic">Vergantines</em>
were finished, and <em class="italic">Mexico</em> beséeged, fearing wante of
vittayle for so greate an armye: yet notwithstanding hée
tooke twentie thousand of them, besides the Carriers, and
that night came to <em class="italic">Tezmoluca</em>, which stādeth sixe leagues
from <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, and is a Village apperteyning to <em class="italic">Huexocinco</em>,
where he was by the principall of the Towne wel
receyued. The next day he iourneyed foure leagues, into
the territorie of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and there was lodged on the side
of a hill, where many had perished with colde, had it not
bin for the store of woodde which they found there. In the
morning he ascended vpwards on this hill, and sente hys
scoute of foure footemen and foure horsemen to discouer,
who found the way stopped with great trées newly cutte
downe, and placed crossewise in the way: but they thynking
that yet forwards it was not so, procéeded forthe as
well as they might, till at length the let with great hugie
trées was such, that they could passe no further, and with
this newes were forced to returne, certifying <em class="italic">Cortes</em> that
the Horsemenne coulde not passe that way in any wyse.
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> demaunded of them, whether they hadde séene anye
people, they aunswered no, wherevppon he procéeded forwarde
with all the Horsemen, and a thousande footemen,
commaundyng all the residue of hys armye to followe
hym wyth as muche spéede as myghte bée, so that wyth
that companye whyche he carried with him, he made
waye, takyng away the trées that were cutte downe to
disturbe his passage: and in this order, in short time passed
his host, without any hurt or daunger, but with great
payne and trauell, for certaynely if the enimies had bin
there to defende that passage, oure menne hadde not passed,
for it was a verye euill way, and the enimies also
thoughte the same to be sure with the trées whiche were
crossed the way, wherevppon they were carelesse of that
place, and attended their comming in playne grounde:
for from <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em> to <em class="italic">Mexico</em> are thrée wayes, of the
whiche <em class="italic">Cortes</em> chose the worst, ymagining the thing that
afterwards fell out, or else some hadde aduised him howe
that way was cléere from the enimies. And béeing past
this crooked passage, they espyed the lake of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and
gaue vnto God moste hartie thankes for the same, and
there made a solemne vowe and promise, not to returne,
vntill they had wonne <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, or lost their liues. They
abode there and rested themselues, till all the whole armye
were come togither, to descende downe into the
playne, for nowe they myghte descrye the fires and
beacons of theyr enimies in sundrye places, and all
those whyche hadde attended theyr commyng by the
other two wayes, were now gathered togyther, thynkyng
to sette vppon them betwixte certayne bridges,
where a greate company aboade, exspecting theyr commying:
but <em class="italic">Cortes</em> sente twenty Horsemen, who made
way among them, and then followed the whole armye,
who slewe manye of them, wythoute receyuyng
anye hurte. And in thys order they came to <em class="italic">Quahutipec</em>,
whiche is of the iurisdiction of <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>,
where they abode that nyghte, and in that place
founde neyther manne nor Woman: but not farre
off was pytched the Campe of the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Culhua</em>,
which myght be néere a hundred thousand men of warre,
who were sent by the Seniors of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>, to
encounter oure armye, in consideration whereof, <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
kept good watch with tenne Horsemen, and all his Souldyers
were warned to be in readynesse at a call, if néede
should happen.</p>

<p>The next day in the morning he departed from thence
towarde <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>, whiche standeth thrée leagues distante,
and procéeding on their iourney, foure principal persons,
inhabitantes of <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>, mette with them, bearing a rod
of golde, with a little flagge, in token of peace, saying,
that <em class="italic">Coacuacoyozin</em> their Lord had sent them to desire him
not to make any spoyle in his Countrey, and likewise, to
offer his friendship, praying also, that it might please him
with his whole army to take his lodging in the Towne
of <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>, where he shoulde be well receyued. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> reioyced
with this message, although he suspected that it
was a fayned matter, but one of them he knewe verye
well, whome he saluted, saying: My comming is not to
offend any, but rather to do you good. I will also receyue
and hold your Lord for a friende, with condition, that hée
doe make vnto me restitution of the treasure whyche hée
tooke from fiue and fortie Spanyards, and thrée hundred
<em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em>, all the which were by his commaundements
also slayne of late dayes. They aunswered that <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>
caused them to be murthered, who had likewise taken
the spoyle, and that the Citizens of <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em> were not culpable
in that fact, and with this aunswere they returned.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> went forward on his way, and came to <em class="italic">Quahutichan</em>
and <em class="italic">Huaxuta</em>, which are suburbes of <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>, where
he and all his host were plenteously prouided of al things
necessary, and threw downe the Idolles. This done, hée
entred into the Citie, where his lodging was prepared in
a great house, sufficient for him and all the Spanyardes,
with many other the <em class="italic">Indian</em> friends. And bycause that at
his first entry, he sawe neyther women nor children, hee
suspected some treason, and forthwith proclaymed, vpon
payne of death, that none of his men should go out. The
Spaniards began to triumph in their lodgings and chābers,
placing euery thing in good order. In the euening
they went vp into the <em class="italic">Zoties</em> and galleries, to beholde the
Citie, which is as bigge as <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and there they sawe
the greate number of Citizens that fledde from thence
with their stuffe, some towardes the mountaines, and others
to the water side to take boate, a thing straunge, to
sée the great hast and stirre to prouide for themselues,
at the least ther were twentie thousand litle boates (called
<em class="italic">Conoas</em>) occupyed, in carying houshold stuffe and passengers.
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> would fayne haue remedied it, but that
night was so nygh at hand, that he coulde not. He would
gladly also haue apprehended the Lord, but he was one
of the first that fledde vnto <em class="italic">Mexico</em>. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> caused many of
the Citizens, to be called before him, and hauing in hys
company a yong gentleman of a noble house in that coūtrey,
who was also last christened, &#38; had to name <em class="italic">Hernādo</em>,
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> being his godfather, who loued him well, sayde
vnto the citizens, that this new Christian lord, <em class="italic">Don Hernādo</em>,
was sonne vnto <em class="italic">Nezaualpincintli</em> their louing Lord,
wherfore he required them to make him their king, considering
that <em class="italic">Coacnacoyocin</em>, was fled vnto the enimies, laying
also before them his wicked fact in killing of <em class="italic">Cacuza</em>
his own brother, only to put him from his inheritance &#38;
kingdome, through the enticemente of <em class="italic">Quahutimoccin</em>, a
mortal enimie to the Spaniards. In this sort was <em class="italic">Don
Hernando</em> elected king, and the fame therof being blowen
abroade, manye citizens repayred home againe to visite
their newe Prince, so that in short space the citie was as
wel replenished with people, as it was before, and being
also well vsed at the Spaniardes handes, they serued
them dilygentlye in all thyngs that they were commaunded.
And <em class="italic">Don Hernando</em> aboade euer after a faithfull
friende vnto the Spaniardes, and in short tyme
learned the Spanishe tongue: and soone after came the
inhabitants of <em class="italic">Quahutichan</em>, <em class="italic">Huaxuta</em> and <em class="italic">Auntenco</em>, to
submytte them selues, crauing pardon, if in any thyng
they had offended. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> pardoned them, and gaue
them licence to departe home vnto their houses.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Quahutimoc</em>, <em class="italic">Coacnacoijo</em> and other magistrates of <em class="italic">Culhua</em>
sente to rayle vppon those townes, for yéeldyng
themselues to the Christians, but they layde hold vpon
the messengers, and brought them vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, of
whome he enformed himselfe of the state of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and
sent them backe againe, requiring their Lords of peace
and friendshippe: but it preuayled not, for they were
fully armed for the warre.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A good correction.</div>

<p>At this instante certaine friendes of <em class="italic">Iames Velasquez</em>
went vp and downe the Campe, procuring secretly a
mutenie among the souldiers, to haue them to returne
to <em class="italic">Cuba</em>, and vtterly to destroy <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his procéedings.
This thing was not so secretly wrought, but that <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
had knowledge, wherevppon he apprehended the doers
thereof, and by their confessions the matter did plainely
appeare, whervpon he condemned to death one <em class="italic">Antonio
de Villafania</em>, who was natural of <em class="italic">Samora</em>, and forthwith
executed the sentence, wherwith the punishment
and Mutinie was ended, and ceassed.</p>

Dayly increased <em class="italic">Cortes</em> in strength and
reputation, and many townes as wel
of the partes of <em class="italic">Culhua</em> as others
came vnto his friendship and obedience.
Within two days that <em class="italic">Don Hernando</em>
was made king, came certayne
gentlemen of <em class="italic">Huaxuta</em> and <em class="italic">Quahutichan</em>,
to certify vnto him, how al the power of the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>
was comming towardes them, and to knowe if it
were his pleasure, that they should carry their wiues,
children, and other goods into the Mountaines, or els to
bring them where he was, theyr feare was so great.
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> made vnto thē this answere, saying: be ye of good
courage, and feare ye not. Also I pray you to cōmaunde
your wiues &#38; families to make no alteratiō, but rather
quietly to abide in your houses. And cōcerning the enimies,
I am glad of their comming, for ye shal sée how I
will deale with them. But the enimies wente not to
<em class="italic">Huaxuta</em>, as it was thought: neuerthelesse <em class="italic">Cortes</em> hauing
intelligence where they were, wente out to encounter
them, with two pieces of Ordinaunce, twelue horsemen
and two hundred Spaniardes, with many <em class="italic">Indians</em> of
<em class="italic">Tlaxcallā</em>. He fought with the enemie, and slew but few,
for they fledde to the water. He burnt certaine townes
where the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> were wonte to succour themselues.
The next day came the chiefest men of thrée townes to
craue pardon, and to beséech him not to destroy thē, promising
neuer to harbour nor succour, any of <em class="italic">Culhua</em>.</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> hearing what these townes men pretended,
with greate yre made a foule correction among
them, as dyd appeare by many of them, which came vnto
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> with broken heads, desiring reuengement.</p>

<p>The inhabitaunts of <em class="italic">Chalco</em> sent also vnto him for succour,
declaring that the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> made greate spoyle among
them. But <em class="italic">Cortes</em> being ready to send for his Vergantines,
could not relieue them all, and especially wyth
Spaniardes: wherefore he remitted them to the helpe of
the <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em>, and vnto thē of <em class="italic">Huexocinco</em>,
<em class="italic">Chololla</em>, <em class="italic">Huacacholla</em>
and other friends, promising that shortly he would
come himselfe. But this answere pleased him not, yet for
the present néede they required his letters to be written
vnto those townes. And being in this communication,
there came messengers from <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, with news, that
the Vergantines were ready, and to knowe if he stoode
in néede of any succour, for of late, (quoth they) we haue
séene many beacons, and fiers, which are greater tokens
of warre, than heretofore hath bene séene.</p>

<p>There came at that time, a Spaniard also from <em class="italic">Vera
Crux</em>, with certaine newes, that there had arriued a ship,
whiche had brought thirtie Souldiers besides the mariners
of the shippe, with eight horses, great store of pouder,
shotte, crossebowes, and Harquebushes. The plesent
newes reioyced much our men, wherevpon <em class="italic">Cortes</em> sente
forthwith to <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em> for the Vergantines, <em class="italic">Gonzalo de
Sandoual</em>, with two hundered Spaniards, and fiftéene
horsemen, and commaunded that in their way they shold
burne and destroy the towne where the fourty fiue Spaniardes,
and thrée hundered <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em> were slayn, with
fiue horses moe, when <em class="italic">Mexico</em> was last besieged: and y<sup>t</sup>
village is in y<sup>e</sup> iurisdiction of <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>, and bordereth vpon
the territorie of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, yea, and for that purpose hée
would gladly haue corrected and punished the dwellers
of <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>, but time then permitted not y<sup>e</sup> same, although
they had deserued more punishment than the others. For
why? in their town they were sacrifised and eaten, yea &#38;
the walles painted with their bloud, shewing moreouer
perfit tokens, how it was spaniards bloud. They pluckt
off also the horses skinnes &#38; tanned thē in the heare, and
afterwards hung them vppe, with the horseshoes in their
great temple, &#38; next vnto them, the spaniards garmētes,
for a perpetual memory.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Sandoual</em> went vnto that place with determinate entēt
to follow his cōmission, &#38; also before he came to y<sup>e</sup> place,
he found writtē in a house w<sup>t</sup> a cole, these words: here in
this house was a prisoner y<sup>e</sup> vnfortunate <em class="italic">Iohn Iust</em>, who
was a gentleman, and one of the fiue horsemen that wer
taken. But the people of that towne, being many, fledde
when they saw the Spaniardes approch neare vnto thē.
But <em class="italic">Sandoual</em> followed them, and slewe many of them:
he toke also prisoners, manye women and children, who
yelded themselues vnto his mercie, and their bodies for
slaues. He séeing so little resistance, and beholding the pitiful
mone of the wiues for their husbandes, and the children
for their fathers, had compassiō on them, and wold
not destroye their towne, but rather caused the dwellers
to come again, and pardoned them, with othe, that hereafter
they shoulde serue them truely, and be vnto them
loyal friends. In this sorte was the death of the Christians
reuenged, yet <em class="italic">Sandoual</em> asked them howe they
slewe so manye Christians without resistaunce, marye
(quoth they) we made an ambush in an euil and narrow
way, ascending vp a hill, and there as they went vppe by
one and one we spoyled them, for there, neyther horses
nor other weapon could defend or help thē, so y<sup>t</sup> we tooke
them prisoners and sente them to <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>, where, as is
before declared, they were sacrificed in the reuengement
of the imprisonment of <em class="italic">Calama</em>.</p>

Nowe when the enemies which murdered
the Spaniardes, were reduced and
chastened, <em class="italic">Sandoual</em> procéeded forwarde
towarde <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, and at the border of
that prouince, he mette with the Vergātines
whiche were broughte in pieces, as tables, planches,
and nayles, with all other furniture, the whyche
eight thousand men caryed vpon their backes.</p>

<p>There came also for their safeconduicte twentie
thousande men of warre, and a thousande <em class="italic">Tamemez</em>, who
were the carriers of victuals, and seruantes. Thē the
Spanishe Carpenters sayde vnto <em class="italic">Sandoual</em>, that for
as muche as they were nowe come into the countrey of
enimies, it might please him to haue regarde thervnto,
for daungers that myght happen: he allowed wel theyr
iudgement.</p>

<p>Nowe <em class="italic">Chichimecatetl</em>, being a principal man and a valiant
also, was captaine of a thousande men &#38; desired to
haue the vantguard with the Tymber, and hauing had
the same charge hithervnto, it should be an affrent for
him, to be put from it, and gaue manye reasons in hys
behalfe. But notwithstanding his request, he was entreated
to take the reregarde. And that <em class="italic">Tutipil</em> and <em class="italic">Teutecatl</em>
captaines, very principal gentlemen, should haue
the vantgard, with ten thousand men. In the myddest
were placed the <em class="italic">Tamemez</em>, and those that carryed the
foyst, with all the apparell of the Vergantines. Before
those two captaynes, went a hundered Spaniardes, and
eight horsemen, and behind and last came <em class="italic">Sandoual</em> with
all the residue, and seuen horsemen. But now although
<em class="italic">Chichimecatetl</em> was offended, touching his firste charge,
now much more bycause the Spaniardes were not in
his company, saying (quoth he) ye take me not for valiant,
or else not faithful. That matter being pacified, and
euery thing in good order, they toke their way towarde
<em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>, with a marueylous noyse, crying, Christians,
Christians, <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, and Spayne.</p>

<p>On the fourth day they entred into <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>, in verye
good order, with the sounde of drummes, snayle-shelles,
and other like instrumentes of Musicke, and againste
their entry into the Citie, they put on al their brauerye

Manye prouinces of <em class="italic">India</em>, came to submitte
and offer their seruice vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em>,
some for feare of destruction, and others
for the hatred whyche they bare
to the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>: so that nowe <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
was strong both with Spaniardes
and <em class="italic">Indians</em>. Also the Spanishe Captaine of <em class="italic">Segura</em>, sent
a letter to <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, the which letter he had receyued of
another spaniard, the effect therof was as foloweth. Noble
gentlemen, diuerse times I haue written vnto you,
but as yet I neuer receiued answere, nor yet now doe I.
I thynke otherwise, notwithstanding yee shall vnderstande,
that the <em class="italic">Culhuacans</em> haue done much hurte in thys
countrey, but we remayne with victorie. This prouince
desireth to see and knowe Captaine <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, for to render
themselues vnto him, and nowe they stande in neede of
our nation, wherfore it may please you to sende vnto vs

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> aunswered the letter in suche sort, that he then
presently coulde not sende the thing desired, for that he
was readye to the siege of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>: notwythstanding hée
gaue them great thankes, with hope shortlye to sée thē.
He that writte the former letter, was one of the Spaniardes
that <em class="italic">Cortez</em> hadde sente to the prouince of <em class="italic">Chinanta</em>,
a yeare paste, to enquire of the secretes of that
place, and to séeke for golde and other commodities.
And if it so happened, that the Lorde of that place

theyr enemyes, for <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> made them
warre béeyng farre from <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, bycause they had entertayned

that Christian, the Lorde aboade alwayes with victorye,
and hauing vnderstanding that some of hys nation
were in <em class="italic">Tepeacac</em>, he wrote so often as the letter declareth,
but none of them came to their handes, but only
this last letter: our men reioyced muche to heare that
the Spaniardes were aliue, and also the Lorde of <em class="italic">Chinanta</em>
to be their friende: likewise they marueyled much
howe they had escaped, for at the time that they fledde
from <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, all other Spaniardes that were abidyng
in the Mynes and other Lordshippes, were slaine by the
<em class="italic">Indians</em>.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> made his preparation for the séege of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>
with all hast, and furnished hym with scalling ladders,
and other necessaryes, fitte for such a purpose. His
<em class="italic">Vergantines</em> being nayled, and throughly ended, he made

broad &#38; more, and two fadome in depth. This worke
was fiftie dayes a doyng, although there were foure hundred
thousand mē dayly working, truly a famous worke
and worthy of memory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A strange tallovve.</div>

<p>The <em class="italic">Vergantines</em> were calked with Towe and cotten
woll, and for want of tallow and oyle, they were (as some
reporte,) driuen to take mans grease, not that they slewe
men for that effect, but of those which were slayne in the
warres. The <em class="italic">Indians</em> who were cruell and bloudy butchers,
vsing sacrifice, would in this sort open the dead bodye,
and take out the grease. The <em class="italic">Vergantines</em> being lanched,
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> mustered his men, and founde nine hundred
Spanyardes, of the which were 86. Horsemen, and a hūdred
and eyghtéene with Crossebowes and Hargabushes,
and all the residue had sundry weapons, as swords,
daggars, Targets, Launces, and Halbertes. Also they
had for armour, corselets, coates of mayle, and Iackes.
They had moreouer thrée great péeces of cast yron, fiftéene
small péeces of brasse, and tenne hundred waighte
of powder, with store of shotte. All that ye haue hearde,
was the prouision that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> had for the séege of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,
the strongest and greatest Citie in all <em class="italic">India</em> and newe
world. In eache <em class="italic">Vergantine</em> he placed a péece of brasse.
He proclaymed agayne all the institutions and ordinances
of the warre, praying and commaunding that they
might be well and faithfully obserued, and said, Brethrē
and my fellowes, now do you sée our vessels readye, yea
and also you do remember howe troublesome a thyng it
hathe bin to bring them hither with the coste and sweate
of our friendes, and one of the chiefest hopes that I haue
shortly to winne <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, are these vessels, for with them
we will burne all their <em class="italic">Canoas</em>, or else we will so locke
them vp, that they shall not help them, whereby we wyll
annoy our enimie as muche that way, as our army shall
do by land. I haue also a hundred thousand men of warre
my friends to beséege this Citie, who are (as you know)
y<sup>e</sup> valiantest men in all these parties. You haue also your
vittailes prouided abundantly, and that which now importeth,
is, that you play the menne, as héeretofore you
haue done, and most humbly to pray vnto God for victorie,
for that this warre is his.</p>

The nexte day following, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> sente vnto the
prouinces of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, <em class="italic">Huexocinco</em>, <em class="italic">Chololla</em>,
<em class="italic">Chal</em>, and other Townes, warning thē within
tenne dayes to come vnto <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>, with theyr
armoure, weapon, and other necessaries, for the séege of
<em class="italic">Mexico</em>. He certifyed them also, how the <em class="italic">Vergantines</em> were
ready with all other furniture accordingly, and the Spanyardes
were very desirous to lose no time, wherefore
they meante not to delay their pretence, farther than the
day appoynted.</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">Indians</em> hearing this newes, and bycause they
would not come too late to the beginning of the assaulte,
came incontinente, and entred into <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em> in good order
of warre, aboue sixtie thousand men, gallantly trimmed
after their vse and custome. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> friendly welcommed
them, and prouided them lodgings accordingly.</p>

<p>On Whitsonday, all the Spanyardes came into the
fielde, whereas <em class="italic">Cortes</em> made thrée chiefe Captaynes
among whome he deuided his whole army. Vnto <em class="italic">Pedro de
Aluarado</em> the first Captayne, he appoynted thirtie horsemen,
and a hundred and seauentie footemen of the Spanyardes,
two péeces of ordinance, and thirtie thousande
<em class="italic">Indians</em>, commaunding him to campe in <em class="italic">Tlacopan</em>. Vnto
<em class="italic">Cristoual de Olid</em> the seconde Captayne, he gaue thrée and
thirtie Horsemen, and a hundred and eyghtéene footemen
of the Spanish nation, two péeces of ordinance, and thirtie
thousand <em class="italic">Indians</em>, and appoynted him to pitch his camp
in <em class="italic">Culhuacan</em>. To <em class="italic">Gonsalo de Sandoual</em> who was the thyrde
Captayne, he gaue thrée and twenty Horsemen, and 160.
footemen, two péeces of Ordinance, and 40000. <em class="italic">Indians</em>,
with commission to choose a place to pitch his Campe.</p>

<p>In euery <em class="italic">Vergantine</em> he planted a péece of ordināce, sixe
hargabushes, or crossebowes, and 23. Spaniards, mē most
fittest for that purpose. He appointed also Captaynes for
eache, and himselfe for general, whereof some of the chiefest
of his companye began to murmure that wente by
lande, thinking that they had bin in greater daunger,
wherefore they required him to goe with the mayne battell,
and not by water. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> little estéemed their words,
for although it is more daunger in the water than in the
land, yet it did more importe to haue greater care in the
warres by water, than on the land, bycause his men had
bin in the one, and not in the other.</p>

<p>On the tenth of May <em class="italic">Aluarado</em>, and <em class="italic">Cristoual de Olid</em>
departed, and went that night to a Towne called <em class="italic">Acolman</em>,
where was betwéene them greate discorde touchyng
their lodgings, yea and if <em class="italic">Cortes</em> had not sente to take vp
the matter, much mischiefe had ensued. The nexte daye
they lodged in <em class="italic">Xolotepec</em>, whych was not inhabited. The
thyrde daye they came vnto <em class="italic">Tlacopan</em>, whyche was also
as all the Townes of the lake, wythout people, there
they were lodged in the Lordes house of the Towne.</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em> began to viewe <em class="italic">Mexico</em> by the calsey,
and foughte with their enimies, vntill the nighte made
them to ceasse.</p>

<p>On the thirtéenth of May, <em class="italic">Cristoual de Olid</em> came to <em class="italic">Chapultepec</em>,
and brake the conduites of swéete water, wherevpon
<em class="italic">Mexico</em> was destitute of the same, being the conduit
that did prouide all the Citie. <em class="italic">Pedro de Aluarado</em> wyth
his company procured to amende all the broken places
of the calsey, that the horsemen might haue frée passage,
and hauing muche to do in these affaires, he spente thrée
dayes, and fighting with many enimies, some of his men
were hurt, and many <em class="italic">Indian</em> friendes slayn. <em class="italic">Aluarado</em> abode
in <em class="italic">Tlacopan</em> with his armye, and <em class="italic">Cristoual de Olid</em> retired
to <em class="italic">Culhuacan</em> with his men, according to the instruction
receyued from <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, and fortifyed themselues in
the Lordes houses of the Towne, and euery daye skyrmished

The newe Kyng <em class="italic">Quahutimoc</em> hauing intelligence
how <em class="italic">Cortes</em> hadde launched hys
<em class="italic">Vergantines</em> and so mightie a power to beséege
<em class="italic">Mexico</em>, entred into counsell wyth
the chiefest péeres of hys Realme. Some
were of opinion, and dyd prouoke hym
to the warres, considering theyr greate multitude of
people, and fortitude of the Citie.</p>

<p>Others were of opinion, who tendred muche the common
weale, that no <em class="italic">Spanyarde</em> that shoulde happen to
be taken prysoner shoulde be sacrificed, but rather to be
preserued for conclusion of peace if néede shoulde so requyre.
And finally some sayde, that they should demaunde
of their Goddes what was best to doe.</p>

<p>The King that inclined himselfe more to peace than to
warre, sayde that he woulde remitte the matter to the
iudgement of the idolles, and that he would aduise them
what answere should be made vnto him but: in harte he
desired to come to some honest order and agréement with
<em class="italic">Cortes</em>, fearing the thyng that after did ensue. But seyng
his Counsell and subiectes so determined to warre, he cōmaunded
foure Spaniardes whiche he had prysoners in
a cage, to be sacrificed vnto the Goddes of warre, with a
greate number more of <em class="italic">Indians</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Diuelish sentence.</div>

<p>He spake to the Diuell in the image of <em class="italic">Vitzilopuchtli</em>,
who answered him that he shoulde not feare the Spaniardes
being but fewe, nor yet those whiche were comen
to helpe them, for that they shoulde not long abide in the
siege, commaunding him to goe forth and to encounter
them without feare, for he would helpe them and kill his
enimies. With this answere of the diuel, <em class="italic">Quahutimoc</em> commaunded
forthwith to breake downe the bridges, watche
the Cittie, make bulwarkes, and to arme fiue thousande
boates, and sayde vnto the Spaniardes, that the Goddes
woulde be pleased with the sacrifice of their bodies, the
Snakes filled with their bloud, and the Tigres relieued
with their flesh, they sayde also to the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>,
ah yée Cuckold knaues, slaues and traytors to your gods
and kyng, will you not repent the wickednesse whiche yée
haue committed agaynst your maisters, therefore shall
you nowe die an euill death, for either you shall die with
hunger, or else vpon the knife: and then wil we eate your
fleshe, and make thereof solemne a banket as the like
hath heretofore neuer bene séene, and in token therof hold
take these armes and legges whiche we throwe vnto you
of your owne men, which we haue now sacrificed for the
obtayning of victory. And after these warres we will
goe vnto your countrey and spoyle your Towne, &#38; leaue
no memory of your bloud or generation. The <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em>
laughed at their madde talke, and sayd, that it should
be better for them to yéelde and submitte themselues to
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> his mercy, and if not, yet it were more honorable to
fight than to bragge, willyng them to come out into the
field. And bad them assuredly beléeue, that the ende of all
their knauery was at hande: it was a world to heare and
sée the bragges and crakes on both sides. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> hearyng
of all these matters, sent <em class="italic">Sandoual</em> to take <em class="italic">Iztacpalapan</em>, and
he enbarked himselfe to méete him at that place.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Sandoual</em> combated the towne on the one side, and the
townes menne and people with feare fledde vnto <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,
on the otherside by water: he burned the towne. <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
came at y<sup>t</sup> time to a strōg rocke lyke a tower, situated in
the water, where many men of <em class="italic">Culhua</em> were, who seyng
them approche with their Vergantines, sette theyr beacons
on fire, and threwe downe vpon them stones and
shotte of theyr arrowes. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> wente ashore with a hundreth
and fiftie menne, and combatted the forte, till at
length he wanne the battlement, whiche was the <em class="italic">Indians</em>
beste defence, and with muche adoe hée came to the toppe,
and there fought vntill he had not lefte one aliue, sauyng
women and chyldren. It was a fayre victorie, although
fiue and twentie Spanyardes were hurte and wounded,
yet the forte was strong, and the ourethrowe a great discouragyng
of the enimie.</p>

<p>At this instant were so many beacons and other fires
made rounde aboute the lake and vpon the hilles, that all
séemed a lighte fire. And also the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> hearyng that
the Vergantynes were comyng, they came out in their
boates, with fiue hundreth Gentlemen whiche came to
sée suche newe kinde of vesselles, and to proue what they
were, beyng a thyng of so greate a fame. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> embarked
himselfe with the spoyle of the forte, and commaunded
his men to abide all togither for the better resistance,
and bycause the enimies shoulde thynke that they feared,
wherevpon they mighte without any good order gyue the
onsette vpon the Christians, and so to fall suddenly into
the snare. But it followed, that when they came within
shotte of the Spaniardes ordinaunce: they stayed abydyng
more company, but in shorte space there came so
many <em class="italic">Canoas</em>, that it séemed a wonder to beholde: They
made suche a terrible noyse with theyr voyces, drummes,
Snayle shelles, and other like instruments of warre, that
they could not heare one an other, with such great crakes
and bragges, as they had done in time paste.</p>

<p>And beyng bothe parties in readinesse to fight, there
happened suche a poupewinde to the Vergantines which
came from the shore, that it séemed meruellous. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> thē
praysing God, commaunded al his Captaines to giue the
onset altogithers, &#38; not to ceasse vntill the enimies should
be dryuen to retire into <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, for that it was the pleasure
of God to sende vnto them that prosperous winde in
token of victory. This talke ended, they beganne to sette
vpon the enimy, who seyng the Vergantines come with
such lucky winde, yea &#38; such a sight as the like vnto them
had not bene séene, they began to flie with suche greate
haste, that they spoyled, brake, and sunke many of them,
and suche as stoode to defende themselues were slayne,
so that this battayle was soone ended. They pursued
them twoo leagues, vntill they had locked them vp
in the water streates of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and tooke many Lordes
and Gentlemen prisoners. And the key of al these warres
cōsisted in this victory, for our mē remayned for Lords of
the whole lake, and the enimie with great feare and losse:
they had not bene so soone spoyled, but that there were so
many of them, who disturbed one an other. But when
<em class="italic">Aluarado</em>, and <em class="italic">Cristoual de Olid</em> saw the fortunate successe
of <em class="italic">Cortes</em> by water, they entered the calsey with their army,
and tooke certaine bridges and bulwarkes, and draue
the <em class="italic">Indians</em> from them, with all their force and strength.
But with the helpe of the Vergantines which came vnto
them, the <em class="italic">Indians</em> were dryuen to runne a whole league
vpon the calsey, and where they founde the calsey broken,
they procured to leape ouer, and so fel into the middest.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> procéeded forwards, and findyng no <em class="italic">Canoas</em>, he
landed vpon the calsey that commeth from <em class="italic">Iztacpalapan</em>,
with thirtie men, and combatted two towers of idolles
whiche were walled with wall of lyme and stone: it was
the same place where <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> receyued <em class="italic">Cortes</em>. He wan
those towers in shorte time, although they were defended
with all possibilitie: he vnshipped thrée péeces of ordināce
to scoure the calsey, which was full of enimies: at first
shotte he did greate hurte among thē, and beyng the night
at hande, they seased on bothe sides for that day. And although
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> had determined otherwise with his Captaynes,
yet he aboade there that night, and sente to the
campe of <em class="italic">Gonsalo de Sandoual</em> for pouder and fiftie mē, with
halfe the company of <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Culhuacan</em>.</p>

The night of <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his abiding there, was
perillous, for he had not aboue a hundreth
men in his cōpany, and aboute midnight
set vpō him many <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> both by water
and lande, although they accustomed
not to fight in the night, but the Vergantines
made them soone to retire.</p>

<p>In the morning came vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em> from <em class="italic">Cristoual de Olid</em>,
eight horsemen, and foure score footemen. The <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>
combated the towers, where <em class="italic">Cortes</em> was lodged, who incontinent
came forth &#38; draue them along the calsey, vntil
he had wonne an other bridge and a bulwarke, and made
a great spoyle among them, with the ordinaunce &#38; horse
men, pursuyng them to the vtmoste houses of the Cittie:
and bycause many of the <em class="italic">Canoas</em> whiche were on the other
side of the calsey galled <em class="italic">Cortes</em> and his menne, he brake
downe so muche of the calsey, that he mighte well passe
some of his Vergantines to the otherside, the which with
few encounters shutte vp the <em class="italic">Canoas</em> on that side, within
the succour of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>: and in this wise he remayned Lord
ouer bothe the lakes.</p>

<p>The next day <em class="italic">Sandoual</em> departed from <em class="italic">Iztacpalapan</em> toward
<em class="italic">Culhuacan</em>, and in his way he tooke and spoyled a little
Citie that standeth in the lake, bycause they came out
to resist him. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> sente vnto him two Vergantines to
passe his men where the calsey was broken. <em class="italic">Sandoual</em> left
his company with <em class="italic">Cristoual de Olid</em>, and wēt to <em class="italic">Cortes</em> with
tenne horsemen, and when he came he found him in fight
with the enimies, and he alightyng from his horse, an <em class="italic">Indian</em>
persed him through the foote with a dart. Many Spaniardes
were hurte that day, but theyr griefe was well
reuenged, for from that day forwarde the <em class="italic">Indians</em> courage
was muche abated. With the paynes, labour and
victory already obtayned, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> might now at ease pitche
his campe at his owne pleasure where he woulde, and also
prouide his army of victuals: sixe dayes he ceassed not
skirmishyng, and the Vergantines likewise founde out
channels that they mighte goe rounde aboute the Cittie,
yea and wente spoylyng and burning many houses within
the Suburbes.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Mexico</em> was besieged in foure places, although at the
first they determined but thrée. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> was placed betwixt
the twoo towers of the calsey: <em class="italic">Pedro de Aluarado</em> in <em class="italic">Tlacopan</em>:
<em class="italic">Cristoual de Olid</em> in <em class="italic">Culhuacan</em>: <em class="italic">Gonsalo de Sandoual</em> in
<em class="italic">Xaltoca</em>: for they had aduise that the same way they would
flée out of the Citie, seyng themselues in any daunger. It
would not haue grieued <em class="italic">Cortes</em> to haue lefte a passage for
the enimy, but only bycause they should not profite themselues
vpon the lande, and prouide the Cittie that way of
armour &#38; victuall, yea, he also thought to preuaile against
his enimies better vpon the lande than vpon the water.
And againe according to the olde prouerbe, When thine

<em class="italic">Cortes</em> pretended to enter the Citie, and to gette
what he could, &#38; also to sée what stomacke the
enimy had: he sent to aduise his captaines, that
eche of them should do the like, requiring them
to sende vnto him some of their horsemen and footemē. He
gaue speciall commaundement to <em class="italic">Cristoual de Olid</em> to haue
regard to the kéeping of his calsey, and to forsée that the
inhabitants of <em class="italic">Xochmilco</em>, <em class="italic">Culhuacan</em>, <em class="italic">Iztacpalapan</em>, <em class="italic">Vitzilopuchtli</em>,

that the Vergantines should goe along the calsey
on bothe the sides, if any néede shoulde happen. <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
early in the morning came out of his campe with .200.
Spaniardes and .80000. <em class="italic">Indian</em> friends: they had gone but
a small space, when they met with their enimies well armed,
keping the gappe where the calsey was brokē, which
broken place mought be a speares length, and as much in
depth. They fought with them, who for a great space defended
themselues behinde a bulwarke, but in fine he
wanne the passage, and followed them vnto the entrance
of the citie, where was a Tower, and at the foote thereof
a bridge drawen, where a good streame of water passed.
This place was very strong to combat, yea and fearefull
to behold the passage where the draw bridge was. They
ceased not shotyng of arrowes and hurlyng of stones, so
that our men coulde not come neare, vntill the Vergantines
came, and by meanes of them they wanne that fort
with lesser paynes than they imagined: for without the
Vergantines it had not bene possible to haue entred the
Cittie.</p>

<p>The enimies being now fled from that holde, our men
alanded there, with the Indian friendes, who incontinent
dammed vp the broken place with stones and earth. The
Spaniardes of the vantgarde, tooke another bulwarke,
which was planted in the largest and fayrest streate of
the Citie, and pursued the enemy to another draw bridge,
which remayned, but with one poste or beame, vppon the
which many of the Indians passed ouer, and then toke y<sup>e</sup>
beame awaye and aboue to defende the place: but when
our men approched &#38; sawe how the matter went, <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
commaunded two pieces of Ordinaunce to be broughte,
with the whiche, and with their Harquebushes, they did
great hurt among the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>, who began to fainte, and
lose their courage, the which being vnderstoode, certayne
Spaniards swā ouer where the draw bridge was, w<sup>t</sup> their
weapons in their mouthes. But when the enimy sawe
them passe ouer, they began, as well from that place as
from the house toppes, zoties and bulwarke, whiche they
had defended for the space of two houres, to flie. <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
and his whole army beyng passed ouer, he commaunded
to damme vp that broken place of the drawe brydge,
with earth, rubbishe and stones, and procéedyng forwarde
they came to an other bridge whiche had no bulwarke,
but was neare one of the chiefest places of the cittie, and
there placed a péece of ordinaunce wherewith they dyd
greate hurte, and seyng them now past all the bridges, they
determined to enter into the harte of the Citie. When
the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> perceyued their determination, they beganne
to prouide euery one for himselfe, for some fledde one way
and some another, but the moste wente to the great temple
of Idols. The Spaniardes and theyr friends pursued
after them, and among the throng gotte into the Temple,
where they slewe many, and at length they wente vp into
the high tower, and there threwe downe the idols, among
whome they made a great spoyle.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Quahutimoc</em> beganne to reprehende his men for their
cowardie and flight, who gathered themselues togither,
and considering theyr ouersight, and that there were no
horses, began a freshe to sette vppon the Spanyardes, and
with force and strength draue them out of all the circuite
of the Temple, and made them truste to their féete. But
when <em class="italic">Cortes</em> sawe his menne come flying, he caused them
to returne and to shewe face vnto the enimy, declaryng
vnto them how shamefull a thyng it was to flie: But seing
the strength and multitude of their enimies, they had
no other remedie but onely to retire to the greate market
place, yea &#38; from thence also they were expelled, and lost a
péece of their ordinaunce. But beyng nowe in this extremitie,
there came thrée horsemen who played the valiant
men and made way through the troupe of enimies,
who at the sight of the horses began to flie, and our men
to follow with suche harte and courage, that in short time
they wan the great temple agayne: then came other sixe
horsemen who ioyned with the other thrée, and lay in ambushe,
where they slew .30. <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>. The day being now

his army to retire, and they obeying his commandemēt,
hadde not so soone turned their backes, but an infinite
number of enimies were at their héeles, who if it hadde
not bin for the Horsemen, had slayne many Spanyardes,
for they came vpon them like rauening dogges without
any feare, yet with the succoure of the Horsemen, the enimie
was putte agayne to flighte, and our men burned
many houses, to auoyde at their next comming the daunger

In this meane while, <em class="italic">Don Hernando</em> of
<em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>, wente throughout his Lordship,
to allure his vassall to the seruice and
friendship of <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, according to his former
promise: and whether it were seyng
the Spanyards prosperitie in the séege of
<em class="italic">Mexico</em>, or otherwise, he broughte almost the whole prouince
of <em class="italic">Culhuacan</em>, whiche is vnder the gouernemente of
<em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>, with sixe or seauen of his owne bréethren, for
more he could not, although he had more than a hundred
bréethren, as héereafter shall be declared. One of them
named <em class="italic">Iztlixuchilh</em> béeyng a valiant yong man, of the
age of foure and twenty yeares, he appoynted generall
Captayne ouer fiftie thousande men of warre, well armed
and trimmed according to their fashion. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> dyd
friendly receyue and welcome them, giuing them greate
thankes for their ayde and good willes. Of these newcome
men, he tooke into his owne host thirtie thousande,
and deuided the residue equally among the other Captaynes.</p>

<p>This was a sorrowfull newes to the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>, to
heare of the succoure which <em class="italic">Don Hernando</em> hadde sente to
serue <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, and with holden the same from them, yea and
also among them were come kinsmen, bréethren, and fathers
to many of them which were in <em class="italic">Mexico</em> in the seruice
of <em class="italic">Quahutimoc</em>.</p>

<p>Two dayes after that these menne were come, there
came also men of <em class="italic">Xochmilco</em>, and certayne husbandmen of
the Moūtaines, who spake the <em class="italic">Otomitlh</em> spéech, beséeching
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> to pardon their long tarrying, offering also both
men and vittayles for the séege. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> was pleased wyth
their cōming and gentle offer, for they being his friēds,
he was assured of them of <em class="italic">Culhuacan</em>, and sayd vnto them,
within these thrée daies (God willing) I wil combate the
Citie, therefore againste that time I praye you prepare
your selues accordingly, and therein shall I knowe whether
you are my friendes or no: and with this aunswere
they departed, promising to fulfill his request, as they
did in déede. This done, he sente thrée <em class="italic">Vergātines</em> to <em class="italic">Sandoual</em>,
and other thrée to <em class="italic">Aluarado</em>, for to disturbe anye succoure
that mighte come from the land to the Citie, and
likewise to defende and ayde the Spanyardes at all
times, when they would land vpon the calsey, to combate
the Citie, for he well vnderstoode howe profitable those
vessels would be néere vnto the bridges.</p>

<p>The Captaines of the <em class="italic">Vergantines</em> ceased not night and
day to runne the coast and Townes of the lake, where
they tooke manye boates from the enimies, laden with
men and victuall, and permitted none to come into the
Citie, nor yet any to come out.</p>

<p>The daye appointed to the enimies for the combate,
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> made his prayers vnto God, &#38; then enformed each
Captayne what he should do, and came foorth with twētie
horsemen, thrée hundred Spanyardes, and a great
number of <em class="italic">Indians</em>, with their péeces of Ordinance, and
where in thrée or foure dayes before they had not skirmished,
time serued the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> at will to open al those
places which were dammed vp before, and also to builde
better bulwarkes thā those which were throwen downe,
attending with that horrible noyse accustomed. But whē
they sawe the <em class="italic">Vergantines</em> on eache side, theyr ioy was
turned into sorrowe, and beganne to fainte, the whiche
oure men vnderstood well, and therewith alanded themselues
vpon the calsey, and wanne the bulwarke and the
bridge. Our army procéedyng forward, set vppon the enimies,
vntill they came to another bridge, the whyche
was likewise wonne in shorte time, and this pursued
from bridge to bridge, alwayes fighting, vntill they had
driuen them from the Calsey and stréetes.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> for his part lost no time, for he with tenne thousande
<em class="italic">Indians</em> laboured to damme vp againe the sluses
and broken places of the bridges, making the way plaine
both for Horsemen and footemen: it was so much to doe,
that all those ten thousand <em class="italic">Indians</em> were occupyed therein
from the morning vntill the euening.</p>

<p>The other Spanyards and <em class="italic">Indian</em> friends skirmished
continually, and slew many of their enimies. Likewyse
the Horsemen so scoured the stréetes, that the enimies
were forced to locke them vp in their houses &#38; Temples.
It was a notable thing to sée how our <em class="italic">Indians</em> played the
menne that daye againste the Citizens: sometimes they
would chalenge them the fielde: other times they would
conuite them to supper, and shewe vnto them legges,
armes, and other péeces of mās flesh, saying behold your
owne flesh which shal serue for our supper and brekefast,
and to morrow we wil come for more, therefore flye not,
you are valiant fellowes, yet it were better for you to
dye fighting than with hunger. And after all this spéech,
euery one of them called vppon the name of his owne
Towne with a loude voyce, setting fire vppon their houses.
The <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> were replenished with sorrow, to sée
themselues so afflicted with Spanyardes, but yet theyr
sorrowe was the greater, to heare their owne vassals so
raile againste them, saying and crying at their owne
dores, victory, victory, <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, <em class="italic">Chalcho</em>, <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>, <em class="italic">Xochmilco</em>,
and other Townes: the eating of the fleshe gréeued
them not, for they did the like.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> séeing the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> so stoute and hard harted,
with full determination eyther to defend themselues or
else to dye, therevpon he bethought himselfe vppon two
things, the one was, that he shoulde not obteyne the treasure
whiche he had séene in the time of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>: the other
was, that they gaue him occasion totally to destroy
the Citie. Both these things gréeued him much, but especially
the destructiō of the citie. He ymagined with himselfe
what he mighte doe, to bring them to acknowledge
their error, and the hurt that mighte fall vpon them, and
for these considerations he pluckt downe their Towers,
and brake their idolles. He burned also the greate house
wherein he was lodged before, and the house of foule
which was néere at hād. There was not one Spanyard
who had séene that magnificall building before, but lamented
sore the sight: but to agréeue the Citizens, it was
commaunded to be burned. There was neuer <em class="italic">Mexican</em>,
that thought any humaine force, how much lesse so fewe
Spanyards, shoulde haue entred into <em class="italic">Mexico</em> in despite of
them all, and to sette fire vpon their principallest edifices
within the Citie. While this house was a burning, <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
gathered his men, and retired to his Campe. The
<em class="italic">Mexicans</em> would fayne haue remedyed the fire, but it was
too late, and séeing our men retire, they followed wyth
their noyse accustomed, and slue some of our men, who
were laden with the spoyle, and came behinde the reste.
The horsmen relieued our men, and caused the enimy to
retire, in such wise, that before night al our men were in
safetie and the enimies in their houses, the one sorte
full of sorowe, and the others wearied with fighte and
trauel. The slaughter was great that day, but the burning,
and spoyle of houses was greater, for besides those
whiche wee haue spoken of, the Vergantines did the
like where they wente, and the other Captaines also
were not idle where they were appointed.</p>

<em class="italic">Pedro de Aluarado</em>, would passe his
army to y<sup>e</sup> market place of <em class="italic">Tlalulco</em>,
for he toke much payn &#38; stoode
in perill in susteyning y<sup>e</sup> bridges
which he had gotten, hauing hys
forte almost a league frō thence.
And again, he being a man of a
haughtie stomacke, thinking as
wel to get honor as his general, and likewise being procured
by his company, who sayde, that it were a shame
for them if <em class="italic">Cortez</em> should winne that market place, being
more nearer vnto them, than vnto him: wherevpon
he determined to winne those bridges which as yet wer
vnwonne, and to place himselfe in the market place. He
procéeded with all his army vntill they came to another
brokē bridge, which was sixtie paces of length, and two
fadome depe, the whiche with the helpe of the Vergantines,
he wan in short space, and gaue order to certaine
of his men to damme it vppe substancially, and he himselfe
pursued his enimies, with fiftie Spaniardes. But
when the Citizens sawe so few in number, and al footemen,
(for the horses coulde not passe the sluce so soone,)
they came vpon them so sodainely &#38; fiercely, that they
made our men to turne their backes, and trust to theyr
legges, yea and our men fel into the water, they knewe
not which way. They slew many of our <em class="italic">Indias[=a?]</em>, and four
Spaniards, who forthwith they sacrifised, and eate their
fleshe in the open sight of al the army.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Aluarado</em> saw his owne folly, in not beleauing <em class="italic">Cortes</em>,
who had always forewarned him, not to procede foreward,
vntil he had made the way sure behinde him: but
<em class="italic">Aluarado</em> his counsellers payde their counsel with life
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> sorrowed for the same, for the like had happened
vnto him, if he had giuen credite to their counsel. But
as a prudent captain, he considered the matter better, for
euery house was then an Ilande, the calsey broken in
many places, and the zoties or house toppes beset with
stones, for these and suche like places vsed <em class="italic">Quahutimoc</em>.
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> went to see where <em class="italic">Aluarado</em> had pitched hys
campe, and also to rebuke him for that which was past,
and to aduise him what he shold do: But when he came
and found him so farre within the libertie of the Citie,
and the daungerous places which hadde passed, he dyd
highly cōmend his valiaunt and good seruice: he also cōmuned
with him of manye things concerning the siege,
and then returned to his owne campe.</p>

<em class="italic">Cortez</em> delayed the time to pitche his
campe in the market place of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,
although daily his menn entrede
and skirmished with in the Citie, for
the causes before alleaged, and likewise
to sée if <em class="italic">Quahutimoc</em> would yéeld
himself. And also the entrie could not
be but very daungerous, for the great multitude of enimies
that filled vp the streates.</p>

<p>Al his company Spaniardes ioyntly, with the kings
Treasurer, séeing the determination of <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, and the
hurt already receyued, besought and also required him
to passe his campe vnto the market place: who aunswered
them, that they had spoken like valiaunt men, but
as yet (quoth he) it is not time conuenient, &#38; we oughte
to consider better of the matter: for why? the enimies are
fully determined to ende their liues in defence of that
place. But his men replyed so muche, that hee was
compelled to graunte to theyr requeste, and proclaymed
the entraunce for the nexte daye following. Hee
wrote also in his letters to <em class="italic">Gonsalo de Sandoual</em>, &#38; to <em class="italic">Pedro
de Aluarado</em>, the instructions of the things that they
should doe, whiche was in effect, to <em class="italic">Sandoual</em>, that hee
shoulde remoue hys campe wyth all hys fardage, as
thoughe he woulde retire and flye, and that vppon the
calsey he shoulde haue tenne horsemen in ambushe, behinde
certaine houses to the intent that when the Citizens
should espie thē flie, and would pursue after, thē to
passe betwixt them and home with the said horsemen, &#38;
after the hurt done among them, in this sort, that then he
with al his army shoulde come where <em class="italic">Pedro de Aluarado</em>
aboade, with other tenne horsemen, a hundered footemen,
and the Nauye of Vergantines, and leauing with hym
his men, should then take thrée of the Vergantines, and
to procure to winne that broken bridge, where <em class="italic">Aluarado</em>
of late receiued the foyle: and if he fortuned to wynne
that place, that then he should damme it vp, and make it
sure, before he passed anye further: and the like order he
gaue vnto him for al other broken places that he should
passe.</p>

<p>Vnto <em class="italic">Aluarado</em> he gaue commission, that he shoulde
passe as farre into the Citie as he myght possible, requyring
him also to send vnto him eightie Spaniardes. Hée
also appointed the other seauen Vergantines, to passe
into both y<sup>e</sup> lakes, with thrée thousand <em class="italic">Canoas</em>. He deuided
likewise all his army into thrée companies, bycause they
had thre ways to enter into the citie. By the one of these
wayes or streates, entred the Treasurer and Auditor,
with seauentye Spaniardes, twentie thousande <em class="italic">Indians</em>,
eight horsemen, twelue labourers with pickeaxes and
Shouels, and many other ydle felowes, to cary earth and
stones, and to fill vp the broken places, and to make the
way plaine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A kinde harted captaine.</div>

<p>The seconde streate he commended to <em class="italic">George de Aluarado</em>
and <em class="italic">Andres de Tapia</em>, with eightie Spaniardes,
tenne thousande <em class="italic">Indians</em>, two pieces of Ordinaunce, and
eight horsemen. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> himselfe toke the thirde way, wyth
a great number of friendes, and a hundred Spaniardes
footemen, of the whiche were twentye fiue with Crossebowes
and Harquebushes, and cōmaunded his horsemē
which were eight in number, to abide there behinde, and
not to falow after, vntil he shold sende for them. In thys
order, and al at one instaut, they entred the Citie, shewing
the harts of valiaunt men, greatly annoying the enemy,
and wan many bridges, but when they came neare
vnto y<sup>e</sup> towne house called <em class="italic">Tianquiztli</em>, there gathered togither
such a number of the <em class="italic">Indian</em> friendes, who before
theyr eyes scaled, entred, and robbed their houses, that
they thought assuredly, that y<sup>e</sup> same day the citie had bin
wonne. <em class="italic">Cortez</em> commaunded that they should procéede no
further, saying, that they had done sufficientlye for that
day, for also he feared afterclappes. He likewise demanded
whether all the broken bridges were made sure, in
the whych (quoth he) cōsisteth the peril and victorie. But
those that went with the Treasurer, following victorie
and spoyle, had left a bridge not well dammed vp, but verye
hollowe and false, the whiche was of twelue paces
broad, and two fadom in depth. When <em class="italic">Cortez</em> was aduertised
hereof, he went thither to remedy the same, but he
was no sooner come, when he sawe his men fléeing, and
leaping into the water, with feare of the cruel enimies,
which followed, who leapt after them into the water, to
kill them. There came also along the calsey manye <em class="italic">Indian</em>
boates of enimies, who toke many of y<sup>e</sup> <em class="italic">Indian</em> friends
and Spaniards aliue. Then <em class="italic">Cortes</em> and other fiftéene persons,
which were with him, serued for no other purpose
but to helpe out of the water those that were fallen, some
came wounded, and others halfe drowned, and without
armour: yea and the multitude of enimies so beset <em class="italic">Cortes</em>,
and his fiftéene companions, who wer helping their mē,
and so occupyed in the same, that they had no regarde to
their owne peril. Wherevpon certaine <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> layd hād
vpō <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, who truly they had carried away if it had not
bin for one <em class="italic">Francisco de Olea</em> his seruāt, who cut off at one
blowe the armes of them that had hold of him, and he by
the enemies was immediately slain, so that he died to
saue his maisters life. Then came <em class="italic">Antonio de Quinionez</em>
captaine of the guard, who caught <em class="italic">Cortes</em> by the arme, &#38;
by force pluckt him out of the throng of enimies, wyth
whom valiantly he fought. But thē with the fame that
<em class="italic">Cortez</em> was prisoner, came many spaniards, among whō
was one horseman, who made some roome, but in shorte
space they thrust him through the throte with a launce,
and made him to retire. The fight ceassed a little, &#38; <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
had a horse brought vnto him, on the which he lightlye
amounted, and gathering his men togither, came
to the streate of <em class="italic">Tlacopan</em>, whiche was large and faire.
There died <em class="italic">Guzman</em> his Chamberlayne, giuing a
horse vnto his maister, whose death was much lamented
among them all, for he was a man valiant, honeste,
&#38; welbeloued. There fel also into the water two horses,
the one was saued, but the other was killed by the <em class="italic">Indians</em>.
As the Treasurer and his company were Combatting
a bulwarke, the enimies threw out of a window
thrée Spaniards heads vnto them, saying, the like they
would do with their heads, if they went not from thence
the sooner. They séeing this sight, and likewise cōsidered
the great hurte and spoyle made among them, began to
retire by little and little.</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">Mexican</em> Priestes went vp into the Towres of
<em class="italic">Tlatelulco</em>, and made their fiers in chafing dishes, and
put therevnto the swéete gūme of <em class="italic">Copalli</em> in token of victorie,
and forthwith stripped fiftie Spaniards captiues
as naked as they were borne, and with their fine rasors
opened them in the breastes, and pluckt out their hartes
for an offering to the Idols, and sprinckled their bloud
in the ayre. Our men seing before their eies the doleful
sight, would fain haue gone to reuēge the cruel custome.
But as time then required they had ynough to doe, to
put themselues in sauetie through the great troupe of
<em class="italic">Indians</em> which came vpon them, who now feared neither
horse nor sword. This day as ye haue heard, were fortie
Spaniards sacrificed, and <em class="italic">Cortes</em> wounded in one of hys
legges, and thirtie moe of his men: they loste a piece of
Ordinance, and foure horses. Also that day was slayne aboue
two thousand <em class="italic">Indian</em> friends, and many <em class="italic">Canoas</em> lost
and the Vergantines in great daunger, and the captain
and maister of one of them were wounded. Whereof the
captaine died within eight dayes, the same day wer also
slaine foure of <em class="italic">Aluarado</em> his men, that daye was an vnfortunate
or dismal day, and the nyght heauy, sorrowfull
and replenished with lamentable griefe among the spaniardes
and their friendes. On the other side, the <em class="italic">Mexicās</em>
tryumphed with ioy, and made great bonefiers, blewe
their hornes, stroke vp their drummes, daunced, banqueted
and dranke themselues drunk: they also opened their
streats and bridges, as they were before, and placed their
scout and watch about the Citie. And as soone as it was
day, the king <em class="italic">Quehutimoc</em>, sent two Christians heads, and
two horse heads into al the comarcanes there aboute, to
signifye their victorie and to require them to forsake the
Christians friendship, promising in short space to make
the like ende of all those that remayned, and deliuer the
countrey from warre, these things encouraged some prouinces
to take armour againste <em class="italic">Cortes</em> being his allied
friendes, as <em class="italic">Maliualco</em> and <em class="italic">Cuixco</em>. This newes was soone
blowen abroade into many prouinces, wherevppon our
men feared rebellion among their new friends, yea and
mutinie in their owne campe, but it pleased god that it
fel out otherwise. The next day <em class="italic">Cortes</em> came out againe
to fight, to shewe face to the enimies, but he turned again
from the first bridge, without doing any great act.</p>

of <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, (who hadde
brought the Timber of y<sup>e</sup>
Vergantines, frō whence
it was wrought, and was
placed in the companye
of <em class="italic">Aluarado</em> at the beginning
of the siege of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,)
séeing that the Spaniards
fought not as they
wer wont to do, he alone
with y<sup>e</sup> men of his owne countrey, went forth to cōbate
the Citie, being a thing which toofore he had not attēpted,
gaue assault against those which defended a certain
bridge, and with great noyse cryed and named his City
and lynage, and in short space wanne the bridge, where
he lefte foure hundered archers, and followed after the
enimie, who of industrie fledde, thinking to take
him at his returne, and at length the enemy returned
vppon him, where they made a fayre skirmishe, for the
fight was equall. There were many hurt and slaine on
both sides, so that with the dead carcasses they supped
at will. But they thoughte to ouerthrowe him at the
bridge, not knowing of y<sup>e</sup> foure hundered archers which
were there to attend <em class="italic">Chichimecatls</em> comming, by meanes
of whome, he passed at pleasure, to the greate griefe
of the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>, yea and remayned not a little amazed
to sée the valor and bolde attempte of the <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em>.</p>

<p>The Spanyards likewise highly commended the fact,
for where oure men combated not as they were wont to
do, the <em class="italic">Mexicās</em> ymagined that the cause was cowardize,
infirmitie, or want of vittayles: wherevpon one daye at
the sunne rising, they set vpon <em class="italic">Aluarado</em> his Camp, whiche
being espyed by the watch, they began to crye, arme,
arme, who came forth as well footemen as horsemen, and
put them to flight, at whiche retire many of the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>
were drowned, and others sore hurt and wounded. Then
said the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>, that they desired to talke with <em class="italic">Cortez</em>,
who came vnto a drawe bridge to knowe what they
would haue, vnto whome sometime they sayd, that peace
was their request, and other times they demanded truce,
but finally required that the Spanyards shoulde departe
from that Countrey. All this policie was but to féele
what strength and courage our menne had, and to haue
truce for a certayne time, for to prouide them of such necessaries
as they wanted, for their determinate purpose
was, to dye in the defence of their countrey and religion.
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> aunswered, that truce was not conueniente for eyther
partie, but peace was laudable at al times, the whiche
for his parte, although he hadde beséeged the Citie,
should not be denyed: therfore he willed them to wey his
plentifull estate of vittayles, and their owne néede and
necessitie of the same. They being in this communication
with their interpreters, appeared an auntient olde man
on the toppe of the Bulwarke, who in the sighte of them
all, pluckt bread out of his satchell péece by péece, and began
to eate, giuing them to vnderstand, that they stoode
in no néede of vittayles, and so made an ende of theyr
talke.</p>

<p>The séege of this Citie séemed a long time to <em class="italic">Cortes</em>,
for in néere fiftie dayes that he had begun the same, yet
could not he bring his desire to passe, yea and much
maruelled that the enimies coulde endure so long a season
with dayly skirmishing, and also how they refused peace
and concord, knowing how many thousands of them had
bin slayne, and ended their miserable liues with hunger.</p>

<p>Yet once agayne he sente this last message vnto them,
that if they woulde not yéelde themselues, then he hauing
them enuironed by land and water, woulde slea thē
all, and not permitte anye kinde of victuall to come vnto
them, so that theyr extremitie shoulde be so greate, that
they should eate one another: their aunswere was, that
firste the Spanyardes shoulde tast of the same cuppe, so
that threatning increased their courages, and occupyed
themselues in carrying stones to the market place, and
many other stréetes, to stoppe the way against the Horses
and their maisters.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em>, although it gréeued him to destroy totally so
beautifull a Citie, yet he determined to bring all the houses
of the stréetes that he should winne to be equall with
the ground, and to stoppe with them the Chanels of water.
He cōmuned the matter with his Captaynes, who
liked well of his intente, although it was a troublesome
thing. He also aduertised the Gentlemen <em class="italic">Indians</em> hys
friends of his determination, who highly commended his
deuice.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> séeyng the towardnesse of all his armye, he called
and prepared all his labourers, with their pikeaxes
and shouels, so that in these affaires, and in setting hys
men in good order, he spent foure dayes, and then he begā
to cōbate the stréete, which goeth directly to the market
place, then fainedly the Citizēs desired peace. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> stayed,
and asked for their King: they aunswered, that they
had sent for him, wherevpon <em class="italic">Cortes</em> taried an houre, and
then they began to reuile him, and to throwe stones, and
shot at him. The Spanyards séeing this, gaue the onser,
and wanne a forte, and came into the chiefe place of the
Citie. They cleansed the stréetes of the stones whiche
they had laide to disturbe their passage, and stopped so vp
the water stréete in that place, in suche wise, that neuer
after it was opened againe, and threw downe all the houses,
making the entrance into the Citie an open playne
high way, and then retired to their camp. Also sixe dayes
arowe they did the like, without receyuing any hurt, sauing
the last day two horses were hurt.</p>

<p>The nexte day <em class="italic">Cortes</em> laide an ambush with fiftie horsmen,
and sent before him the Vergantines, but hée himselfe
with thirtie horsemen, abode in certaine great houses
in the Market place. They foughte that day in many
places of the Citie, and at the retire, one shot of a handgun,
whiche was the token that those which lay in ambushe
should come forth. The enimies folowed our men,
that séemed to flée with maruellous greate courage. But
they were not so soone passed the snare, when <em class="italic">Cortes</em> came
forth with his thirtie horsemen, saying, vpon them, vpon
them: By this onely meane were slaine aboue fiue hundred
<em class="italic">Mexicans</em>, besides the prisoners.</p>

<p>Our <em class="italic">Indian</em> friends had a good supper that nyght with
mans fleshe, whiche as yet they would not be perswaded
to leaue. Certaine Spaniards went vppe into a Tower
of Idols, and there opened a sepulchre, where they found
fiue hundred Castlins in golde: With this ouerthrowe
the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> remayned in suche feare, that all their
threatnings and triumphes were turned into mourning:
and euer after whē they saw our men retire, they would
not folow them, fearing the like danger, so that this was
a meane, the sooner to win <em class="italic">Mexico</em>.</p>

Two poore soules who were vexed wyth
hunger, came in the nighte season out of
the citie vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his Camp, who certifyed,
how the Citizens were in greate
necessitie, and so manye dead with hunger
and sicknesse, that there were heapes
of dead bodyes in the houses, only to kéepe close their extreame
miserie: and said also, that in the night season manye
came out to fishe betwéene the houses with feare of
the <em class="italic">Vergantines</em>, and others came out to séeke for wodde,
hearbes, and rootes to eate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A cruell fact of Cortez.</div>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> hearing these newes, determined to knowe the
troth thereof, so that the nexte night he commaunded the
<em class="italic">Vergantines</em> to goe round about the Citie, and he himselfe
with fiftéene Horsemen, a hundred footemen, and manye
<em class="italic">Indian</em> friends, placed themselues betwixte certaine houses,
with order to his espyes, to aduertise him what they
shoulde sée. It was no sooner day, but manye poore folke
came out to séeke for foode, and when <em class="italic">Cortes</em> had intelligence
thereof, he made a greate slaughter among them,
whereas at that time of vnarmed men, women, and chyldren,
were slayne to the number of eyght hundred: and the
<em class="italic">Vergantines</em> on their side made another spoyle. The pitiful
noise being heard into the Citie, the Citizens were astonyed,
and knew not what to doe, fearing the like ambushe
that they had séene and fealt the day before, &#38; also
wondered, that at such an houre not accustomed, y<sup>e</sup> Spanyardes
were so nigh. The next day following, béeing
S. Iames his euen, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> entred againe into the Citie,
according as he had done before, and wanne the stréete
of <em class="italic">Tlacopan</em>, where he burned the riche and faire houses
of king <em class="italic">Quahutimoc</em>, whiche were motted round aboute: so
that nowe of foure partes of the citie, thrée partes were
wonne, and the Spaniardes might safely passe from <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
his campe, to the campe of <em class="italic">Aluarado</em>, by reason that all
the houses were burned, and beaten downe playne with
the grounde.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A true prophesie.</div>

<p>But yet the poore <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> would say to the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of
<em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em>, goe to, go to, make hast, burne and destroy these
houses, for time will come that yée shall buylde them againe
at your owne coste. For if we haue victory then
shall ye buylde them for vs, and if we be ouercome then
shall yée buylde them for these straungers.</p>

<p>Within foure dayes after, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> entred the citie againe,
and also <em class="italic">Aluarado</em> on his side, who to shewe hys
haultie stomacke, laboured all that was possible to gette
two towers of the temple of <em class="italic">Tlatelulco</em>, the whiche at the
length he wan, although he loste thrée horses in the cōbat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An extreme penurie.</div>

<p>The next day followyng, the horsemen walked vp and
downe in the greate market place at pleasure, the poore
<em class="italic">Mexicans</em> beholding that sorrowful sight frō their houses.
And as the Spaniardes wente walking in the cittie, they
founde heapes of dead bodies in the houses, streates, and
in the water: they found also the barke of trées and rootes
gnawen by the hungry creatures, and the men so leane
and yellow, that it was a pitifull sighte to beholde. <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
yet agayne required them to yéelde, and they although
they were so leane of body were strong in harte, and answered
that he should not speake of any friendshippe, nor
yet hope of their spoyle, for when no fortune would fauour
them, then they woulde eyther burne their treasure,
or throwe it into the lake, where they should neuer
profite therby, and that they would fight while one alone
shoulde remayne aliue. At <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his nexte entry into the
citie, he founde the streates full of women, children, olde
folke, and many miserable sicke persons whiche were perishyng
for want of foode.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> commaunded that none of his army should doe
any hurte vnto such miserable creatures. The principall
folke who were whole and sounde, they stoode in their zoties
or house toppes, without weapon, and clothed in mātels.
It was thought that they kepte a certaine holy day,
peace was againe offered, but they answered with dissimulation.
The next day followyng <em class="italic">Cortes</em> required <em class="italic">Aluarado</em>
on his side to combat a streat of .1000. houses that
was not yet won, and that he would doe the like on the otherside:
for a little space the Citizens defended thēselues,
but their defence endured not, but were driuen to flie, being
not able to resiste the force of theyr contraries. So
that the Spanishe army wan also that streate, and slewe
12000. Cittizens, the murder was so great bicause the <em class="italic">Indian</em>
friends would shewe no mercie or compassion vpon
them, although they were required to the cōtrary. So that
now the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> hauing lost this streate also, the houses
that were not beatē downe could scarcely hold the people
y<sup>t</sup> were aliue, the streates also being so full of dead carcasses
and sicke bodies, that our men coulde not passe but
must néedes treade vpon them. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> desirous to sée what
remayned of the cittie to win, went vp into a high tower,
and hauyng well vewed the Cittie, he iudged that of eight
parts one remained yet to win. And y<sup>e</sup> next day following
he assaulted the same, with speciall cōmaundement giuen
to his army, not to kil any but only such as should resist.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A sorovvfull tale.</div>

<p>The sorrowful Citizens bewayling their vnfortunate
fate &#38; destinie, besought the Spaniards to make an ende,
and to kill them all out of hande. Then certayne of the
horsemen called <em class="italic">Cortes</em> in great hast, who went vnto them
incontinent, hopyng of some agrement of peace: and standing
at the brymme of the water neare vnto a drawe
bridge, the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> sayde, oh captayne <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, consideryng
that thou art the childe of the Sunne, why doest thou not
entreate the Sunne thy father, to make an ende of vs: oh
thou Sunne that canst goe rounde about the worlde in a
day and a night, we pray thée make an end of vs, and take
vs out of this miserable lyfe, for we desire death to go and
rest with our God <em class="italic">Quetcauatlh</em> who tarieth for vs. After
these speaches they made a lamentable crie, callyng vpon
their Goddes with loude voyces. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> answered what he

<em class="italic">Cortes</em> seing the great extremitie that these poore
wretched people were in, thinkyng nowe that
they woulde yéelde vnto him, therevppon hée
spake to an vncle of <em class="italic">Don Hernando de Tezcuco</em>,
who was taken prisoner thrée dayes before, whom he desired
to go to the king &#38; treate of peace: this Gentleman
refused the message, knowyng the determinate will of
<em class="italic">Quahutimoc</em>, but through muche entreatie he graunted to
his request. So the next day followyng <em class="italic">Cortes</em> entred into
the Cittie, &#38; sent that Gentleman &#38; certaine Spaniardes
before him. The <em class="italic">Indian</em> guarde of that streate receyued
him with the honour which vnto such a noble man did appertayne.
He procéeded forward toward the king, &#38; being
come where he was, he declared vnto him his embassage.
When <em class="italic">Quahutimoc</em> had hearde his tale, he was so moued
with yre &#38; choller, that forthwith he commaūded him to
be sacrificed, and gaue the Spaniardes for theyr answere
blowes with stones, staues and arrowes, saying also
that they desired death and no peace, and fought so stoutly
that day, that they slewe many of our menne, and one
horse. Lykewise on their side many were slayne.</p>

<p>The nexte day <em class="italic">Cortes</em> entred the cittie agayne, but he
fought not, hoping then that they woulde submitte themselues,
but yet the Citizens had no such thought. He came
néere vnto a certayne bulwarke on horsebacke, and spake
vnto certaine Gentlemen with whome he was acquaynted,
saying that now within a shorte space he could make
an ende of their finall destruction, but yet of meare compassion
he wished it not, for the loue whiche he bare vnto
them, so that they would in time rēder themselues: wherfore
(quoth he) entreate yée the king to doe the same, and
in so doyng ye shalbe well vsed, and haue victuals sufficient.
The Gētlemen hearing these wordes, fell on weping,
and answered, that now they knew well their errour, and
felte their losse and destruction, notwithstāding they were
bounde to obey their king and Goddes. But yet (quoth
they) abide a while, and we will certifie <em class="italic">Quahutimoc</em> what
you haue sayde, and in shorte space they went and returned
againe, saying that the next day without fayle their Lord
woulde come and talke with him in the markette place.
With this answere <em class="italic">Cortes</em> returned to his campe, and
thought at their méeting to conclude an honorable peace.
So against the next day he caused a Canapie and chayre
of estate to be sette in the markette place, accordyng to
the <em class="italic">Mexican</em> vse, and also a dinner to be prepared. The
day followyng came <em class="italic">Cortes</em> at the houre appoynted, with
many of his men armed, but the king came not: neuerthelesse
he sente fiue noble men to treate of the matter, excusing
the kyng, saying he was not well at ease. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> welcomed
those Gentlemen, and was gladde of their cōming,
hoping thereby to conclude and make some good ende.
And when they had dined and well refresshed their hungry
bodies, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> gaue them victuals, and desired them
to returne agayne to the King, and to declare vnto him
that without his presence the conclusion coulde not be
certayne. They wente and returned againe within twoo
houres, and brought vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em> certaine mantels made of
cotton woll, very good &#38; well wrought, with answere that
the king would not come in any wise, both for shame and
feare. And the next day these messengers came agayn, saying
that the king would come to the place appointed. But
yet he came not, although <em class="italic">Cortes</em> attended his commyng
more than foure houres: who seing the mockerie, he forthwith
sente <em class="italic">Sandoual</em> with his Vergantines one way, and
he himself went an other, combatting the houses &#38; fortes
that yet remayned, where he founde small resistaunce, so
that he might doe what he pleased. There was that day
slayne and taken prysoners aboue .40000. persons, &#38; then
he retired to his campe. The lamentable crie and mourning
of the women and children woulde haue made a stony
hart relent, the stench also of the dead bodies was wōderfull
noysome. That night <em class="italic">Cortes</em> purposed to make an
end the next day of the warres, and <em class="italic">Quahutimoc</em> pretended
to flie, and for that purpose had enbarked hymselfe in a
<em class="italic">Canoa</em> of twētie ores. When the day appeared <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, with
his men, and foure péeces of ordinance, came to the corner
where those that yet remayned were shut vp, as cattell in
a pounde. He gaue order to <em class="italic">Sandoual</em> and <em class="italic">Aluarado</em> what
they shold do, which was, to be ready with their Vergātines,
and to watche the comyng out of the <em class="italic">Canoas</em> whiche
were hidden betwixte certayne houses, and especially to
haue regard vnto the kings person, and not to hurte him,
but to take him aliue. He commaunded the residue of hys
men to force the <em class="italic">Mexican</em> boates to goe out, and he himselfe
wente vp into a tower, inquiryng for the King, and
there founde <em class="italic">Xihuacoa</em>, gouernour and Captayne generall
of the Cittie, who woulde in no wise yéelde himselfe.
Then came out of the Cittie a greate multitude of olde
folkes, men, women and childrē to take boate. The throng
was so great with hast to enter the <em class="italic">Canoas</em>, that many by
that means were drowned in the lake. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> required his
mē not to kil those miserable creatures: But yet he could
not stay the <em class="italic">Indians</em> his friends, who slewe and sacrificed
aboue fiftene thousand. After this, there was a great rumour
among the cōmon people, that the king would flie,
making a piteous mone and saying that they sorowfull
creatures knew not whither to goe: But yet procuryng
to goe into the <em class="italic">Conoas</em>, whiche were so full that there was
no roume for thē, by reason thereof many were drowned.</p>

<p>The men of warre stoode in the house toppes and zoties
beholding their perdition. All the nobilitie of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>
were enbarked with the kyng. Then <em class="italic">Cortes</em> gaue signe
with the shotte of a handgunne, that his captaines should
be in a readinesse, so that in shorte space they wanne fully
and wholy the great Cittie of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>. The Vergantines
likewise brake in among the fléete of boates, without any
resistaunce, and euery one sought where he might beste
succour himselfe, the Royall Standarte was beaten
downe. <em class="italic">Garcia Holguin</em>, who was captayne of a Vergantine,
had espied a great <em class="italic">Canoa</em> of .xx. ores déepe laden with
men. And one of his prysoners sayde vnto him, that the
king wente in that greate <em class="italic">Canoa</em>. <em class="italic">Holguin</em> beyng gladde of
the newes, gaue chase to that <em class="italic">Canoa</em> and ouertooke him.
In his foreship he had thrée crossebowe men. And when
<em class="italic">Quahutimoc</em> who stoode on the puppe of the <em class="italic">Canoa</em> ready to
fighte, sawe those bowes ready bente, and many drawen
swordes, he yéelded himselfe, declaryng that he was the
king. <em class="italic">Garcia Holguin</em> being a gladde man of his prysoner,
tooke and carried him vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em> who receiued him reuerently.
When <em class="italic">Quahutimoc</em> came neare vnto him, he layde
his hande vpon <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his dagger, saying, I haue done all
my possibility to defende me and mine, accordyng to my
duetie, hoping not to haue come to this estate and place
where now I stande: And considering that you may doe
with me what you please, I beséeche you to kill me, and
that is my only request. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> comforted him with faire
words, giuyng him hope of life and seniory, and tooke him
vp into a zotie, requiring him to commaund his subiectes
to yéelde and render themselues: he obeyed his request.
At that time there was about thrée score and tenne thousande
persons, who in seing their Prince, threwe downe

In the order before declared, wanne <em class="italic">Hernando

being the .xiij. of August, <em class="italic">An.</em> 1521. in remembraunce
wherof, and of the great victory, euery
yéere on that day they make a sumptuous
feast &#38; solemne procession, wherin is carried the standart
royall, with the whiche the cittie was won. The siege endured
thrée moneths, &#38; had therein .200000. <em class="italic">Indians</em> .900.
Spaniardes .80. horses .17. péeces of ordinaunce, 13. Vergantines,
&#38; 6000. <em class="italic">Canoas</em>. In this siege were slayne fiftie
Spaniardes &#38; sixe horses, &#38; no great number of the <em class="italic">Indians</em>
their friends. There was slaine on the cōtrary side a hundred
thousand, and some affirme many moe: but I speake
not of them that died with hunger and pestilence.</p>

<p>At the defence of the citie were al the nobilitie, by reason
wherof many were slayne. The multitude of people
was great, who eate litle, dranke salte water, and slepte
among the dead bodies, where was a horrible stenche:
for these causes the disease of pestilence fell among them,
and thereof died an infinite number. Wherevpon is to be
considered, their stedfaste determination, for although
they were afflicted with such hunger, that they were dryuen
to eate boughes, ryndes of trées, and to drinke salte
water, yet woulde they not yéelde themselues. But at the
laste they would haue submitted them, and then their
kyng <em class="italic">Quahutimoc</em> woulde not, bycause at the begynnyng
they refused his will and counsell, and also with their generall
deaths, should appeare no cowardise, for they kept
the dead bodies in theyr houses to kéepe that secrete from
theyr enimies. Here also is to bée noted, that although
the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> eate mans fleshe, yet they eate none of their
owne Cittie or friendes, as some doe thynke: for if they had,
there woulde not so many haue died with hunger.
The <em class="italic">Mexican</em> women were highly commended, not onely
bycause they aboade with their husbandes and Fathers,
but also for the greate paynes they tooke with the sicke
and wounded persons, yea and also they laboured in makyng
slings, cuttyng stones fitte for the same, and throwyng
stones from the soties, for therein they dyd as muche
hurte as their men. The Cittie was yéelded to the spoyle,
and the Spanyardes tooke the Golde, Plate and Feathers,
the <em class="italic">Indian</em> friends had all the rest of cloth and other
stuffe.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> commaunded greate bonfiers to be made in token
of victory, and also to mortifie the horrible stenche
of the dead bodies, whome he lykewise commaunded to
be buried, and some of the prysoners menne and women
he caused to be marked in the face, for the Kings slaues,
and pardoned all the residue. He commaunded the Vergantines
to bée brought ashore, and appoynted one <em class="italic">Villa
fuerte</em>, with .80. men to guarde thē, fearyng least the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>
shold set fire or otherwise destroy them. In this businesse
he occupied himself foure dayes, &#38; then remoued his
campe to <em class="italic">Culhuacan</em>, where he rendred hartie thanks to all
the Gentlemen his friendes, promysing to gratifie their
good and faythfull seruice, desiryng them to departe
home to theyr houses, cōsidering y<sup>e</sup> warre was at an end,
wherevpon they departed almost all in generall, both

Not long before <em class="italic">Hernando Cortes</em> came vnto
the newe <em class="italic">Spayne</em>, did many nightes after the
midnighte appeare in the aire, and in the
same port and place where <em class="italic">Cortes</em> entred into
that land, great lightning of fire, whiche amounted
vpward, and suddaynely vaded away. The <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>
at that time saw flames of fire toward the orient,
where now <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em> standeth, with a great and thicke
smoke, that séemed to touche the heauen and earthe: thys
sight was fearfull vnto them.</p>

<p>They also saw the figures of armed men fighte in the
aire one with another, a new and strange sight for them,
and a thing that filled their heads with ymaginations:
for when there was a prophecie spoken of among them,
how that white men with beardes should come and rule
their kingdome in the time of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em>. The Lordes of
<em class="italic">Tezcuco</em> and <em class="italic">Tlacopan</em> were much amazed, saying, that the
sword whiche <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> hadde, was the armes of those
folke, whose figures they had séene in the ayre, with their
apparell and attire. <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> had muche adoe to pacifie
them, fayning that the weapon and apparell was of hys
forefathers, and bycause they should sée the troth thereof,
he gaue them the sworde, and willed them to breake it if
they coulde, and they prouing to breake the same and
could not, they maruelled thereat, and also were resolued
of their opinions.</p>

<p>It shoulde séeme, that a little before these things
happened, some of <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> his subiectes founde a chest of
apparell and a sworde in it on the sea coast, which came
floting out of some shippe that had wracked there about,
and broughte it to their prince. Others affirme, that the
cause of alteration among the noble men, was, when
they saw the sword and apparell that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> had sent vnto
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> by <em class="italic">Teudilli</em>, séeing it a thing so like the attire
of the figures whiche they had séene in the ayre, but
howsoeuer it was, they beléeued with these new tokens,
that their Kingdome shoulde haue an ende, when they
saw those straungers come into their Countrey.</p>

<p>The same yeare that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> came into <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, appeared
a vision vnto a certaine <em class="italic">Malli</em>, which is to say, a slaue
taken in the warres to be sacrificed, who at the time of
his deathe and Sacrifice, bewayled his sorrowfull ende;
calling vppon the God of Heauen, who at that instante
sawe in spirite a vision, and heard a voyce, bidding hym
not to feare that death, for the God whome be had called
vpon, would haue mercy vpon hym, willing hym also to
say vnto the pristes and ministers of the Idols, that their
wicked sacrifice and bloudsheding was néere at an ende,
and that there was a people at hand, that should take away
all that wicked and abhominable religion.</p>

<p>This <em class="italic">Malli</em> was sacrificed in the middest of the market
place of <em class="italic">Tlatelulco</em>, where at this daye is the place of
execution.</p>

<p>They remembred, and noted well the wordes of the
<em class="italic">Malli</em>, and the vision whiche they called a breath from
heauen.</p>

<p>The earth also brake open, out of the whiche issued a
maruellous greate streame of water, with many greate
fishes, which they iudged and held for a strange pronostication.</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> did reporte, that when on a time
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> came triumphantly with victory of <em class="italic">Xochnuxco</em>, said
vnto the Lorde of <em class="italic">Culhuacan</em>: Now (quoth he) <em class="italic">Mexico</em> is
strong and inuincible, for I haue in subiection <em class="italic">Xochnuxco</em>,
and other prouinces, so that now I am without feare of
any enemie. The Lord of <em class="italic">Culhuacan</em> aunswered, saying,
trust not good King too muche, for one force forceth another,
with the whiche aunswere, <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> was not a
little offended. But when <em class="italic">Cortes</em> hadde taken them both
prisoners, then he called to remembrance the former
talke, and held that saying for a prophesie.</p>

<em class="italic">Cortes</em> pretended to recdifie againe the Citie
of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, not onely for the scituation
and maiestie, but also for the name &#38; great
fame thereof, and also to builde vp that
which he hadde beaten downe, by reason
whereof he trauelled to make this Citie greater, better,
and to be more replenished with people. He named and
appoynted Iudges, Aldermen, Attourneys, Towneclearke,
Notaries, Skauengers, and Seriants, with all
other officers, necessarie for the common weale of a Citie.
He deuided the Citie among the Conquerors, hauing
first taken out places for Churches, market places,
townehouse, and other necessarie plottes to builde houses,
profitable for the common weale. He also separated
the dwellings of the <em class="italic">Spanyards</em> from the <em class="italic">Indiās</em>, so that the
water passeth and maketh deuision betwixt them. Hée
procured many <em class="italic">Indians</em> to come to the building of the Citie,
for auoiding charges, although therein he had somewhat
to do, by reason that many kinsmen of <em class="italic">Quahutimoc</em>
were not as yet come vnder obedience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Seauen thousand Ceder beames.</div>

<p>He made Lorde of <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>, <em class="italic">Don Carolus Iztlixuchitl</em>, by
the consent of the Citie, in place of <em class="italic">Don Hernando</em> his brother,
who was deceassed, and commaunded many of hys
vassals to labour in the workes, bycause they were Carpenters,
masons, and builders of houses. He promised also
to them that were naturals of the Citie of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,
plottes to build vpon, inheritance, fréedome, and other liberties,
and the like vnto all those that woulde come and
inhabite there, whiche was a meane to allure many thither.
He sette also at libertie <em class="italic">Xihuaco</em> the generall Captayne,
and made him chiefe ouer the <em class="italic">Indians</em> in the Citie,
vnto whome he gaue a whole stréete. He gaue likewyse
another stréete to <em class="italic">Don Pedro Mutezuma</em>, who was sonne to
<em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> the King. All this was done, to winne the fauoure
of the people. He made other Gentlemen Seniors
of little Ilands and stréetes to builde vpon, and to inhabite,
and in this order the whole scituation was reparted,
and the worke began with great ioy and diligence:
but when the fame was blowen abroade, that <em class="italic">Mexico</em>
should be built againe, it was a wonder to sée the people
that resorted thither, hearing of libertie &#38; fréedome, the
number was so greate, that in a whole league compasse
was nothing but people both men and women. They laboured
sore, and eate little, by reason whereof, many sickned,
and pestilence followed, whereof dyed an infinite
number. Their paines was great, for they bare on theyr
backes, and drew after them stones, earth, timber, lyme,
bricke, and all other things necessary in this sort, and by
little and little, <em class="italic">Mexico</em> was built againe with a hundred
thousande houses, more stronger and better than the olde
building was. The Spanyardes also built their houses
after the Spanish fashion. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> built his house vpon the
plotte where <em class="italic">Mutezuma</em> his house stoode, whiche renteth
now yéerely foure thousand duckates a yeare. <em class="italic">Pamfilo de</em>
<em class="italic">Naruaez</em> accused him for the same, saying, that he hadde
spoyled the woddes and mountaynes, and spente seauen
thousand beames of Ceder trées in the worke of his own
house. The number séemeth more héere than there, for
where all the Mountaynes are replenished with Ceder
trées, it is a small matter. There are Gardines in <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>,
that haue a thousand Ceder trées for walles and circuite,
yea and there are Ceder trées of a hundred &#38; twēty
foote long, and twelue foote in compasse from ende to end.
They built faire dockes couered ouer with arches for y<sup>e</sup>
Vergantines, whereas (for a perpetuall memorie) all the
thirtéene Vergantines do remayne vntil this day. They
dammed vp the stréetes of water, where now faire houses
stand, so that <em class="italic">Mexico</em> is not as it was wont to be, yea
and since the yeare of 1524. the lake decreaseth, and sometime
casteth out a vapour of stench, but otherwise it is
a wholesome and temperate dwelling, by reason of the
Mountaynes that standeth round about it, and well prouided
through the fertilitie of the Countrey, and commoditie
of the lake, so that now is <em class="italic">Mexico</em> one of the greatest
Cities in the world, and the most noble in all <em class="italic">India</em>,
as well in armes as policie. There are at the least two
thousande Citizens, that haue each of them his horse in
his stable, with riche furniture for them. There is also
great contractation, and all sortes of occupations. Also
a money house, where money is dayly coyned: a fayre
schole, whiche the Vizeroy <em class="italic">Don Antonio de Mendosa</em> caused
to be made. There is a greate difference betwixte
an inhabitant of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and a Conqueror, for a Conqueror
is a name of honor, and hathe landes and rentes, and
the inhabitante or onely dweller payeth rente for hys
house. When this Citie was a building, &#38; not throughlye
furnished, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> came from <em class="italic">Culhuacan</em> to dwell there.
The fame of <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, and maiestie of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, was blowen
abroade into farre prouinces, by meanes whereof, it is
now so replenished, as I haue before declared, yea &#38; hath
so many <em class="italic">Spanyards</em>, who haue conquered aboue 400. leagues

In these dayes <em class="italic">Cortes</em> was the man of the
greatest name of all the Spanish nation,
although many had defamed him, and especially
<em class="italic">Pamfilo de Naruaez</em>, who was in
the Court of Spaine accusing him. And
where, of long time the Counsell of <em class="italic">India</em>
had receyued no letters from him, they suspected, yea and
beléeued, whatsoeuer euil was spoken of him. Wherevppon
they prouided the Admirall <em class="italic">Don Diego Colon</em>, for Gouernour
of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, who at that time went to lawe wyth
the king, pretending the said office and many others, with
condition to carrie at his owne coast a thousand men to
apprehend <em class="italic">Cortes</em>. They prouided also for Gouernour of
<em class="italic">Panuco</em>, one <em class="italic">Nonio de Gusman</em>, and <em class="italic">Simon de Alcazaua</em> portingall,
for gouernour of <em class="italic">Honduras</em>. To kindle more thys
mischiefe, and to set this businesse forward, one <em class="italic">Iohn de Ribera</em>,
the Attourney of <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, was a fitte and an earnest
instrument againste his maister, and the cause was, for
falling out with <em class="italic">Martin Cortes</em>, father vnto <em class="italic">Hernando Cortes</em>,
about foure thousand Duckates which <em class="italic">Cortes</em> had sent
by him to his father, which money the said <em class="italic">Ribera</em> his Attourney
kept to his owne vse, and therefore raised many
slaunders against his maister, yea and credite was giuen
to his tales, but on a night he had a morsell of bacon gyuen
him vppon a skaffolde, wherewith he was choked in
the chiefe time of his businesse. These newe officers, and
their prouisions, were not so secretely obteyned, but the
matter was as secretely talked in the Courte, whiche at
that time was abiding in the Citie of <em class="italic">Toledo</em>, and the procedings
séeme not iust vnto the friends of <em class="italic">Cortes</em>. The
Commendador <em class="italic">Pedro de Pina</em> opened the matter to the Licenciat
<em class="italic">Nouez</em>, and vnto father <em class="italic">Melgareio</em>, wherevppon
they reclaymed of the Counsels determination, beséeching
them to stay for a season, to sée what newes should
come from <em class="italic">Mexico</em>. Also the Duke of <em class="italic">Beiar</em> tendred the
cause of <em class="italic">Hernando Cortez</em>, for that <em class="italic">Cortez</em> by promise of
faith and troth, was assured in marriage to his brothers
daughter, named the Lady <em class="italic">Iane de Zuniga</em>, who aplaked
the Emperoure his anger, and the saide Duke became
suretie to aunswere in all causes for him.</p>

<p>The matter standing in this estate, there arriued in
<em class="italic">Spayne Diego de Zoto</em>, with a whole Coluerin made of siluer,
and 70000. castlins in golde, the newes whereof was
blowen ouer all <em class="italic">Spaine</em>. And to say the troth, this presente
was y<sup>e</sup> cause, that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> was not put out of his office, but
a Iudge of residence was sent thither to take an accompt
of him. Now a wise and a learned man was sought for
that purpose, yea suche a one as could rule the matter, for
some souldiers are oftentimes vnmanerly: whervpō they
thought the Licenciat, <em class="italic">Lewes pouce de Leon</em> a fitte mā, who
had bin Lieutenante to <em class="italic">Don Martin de Cordoua</em>, Earle of
<em class="italic">Alcaudete</em>, &#38; chiefe gouernour of the citie of <em class="italic">Tolledo</em>. This
Licenciate with power sufficient, was sent vnto the new
<em class="italic">Spaine</em>, who carried in his company as assistant, the batcheler
<em class="italic">Marcus de Aguillar</em>, who hadde ruled in time past,
in a worshipfull office of Iustice in the Ilande of <em class="italic">Santo
Domingo</em>.</p>

<p>With prosperous weather they departed from
Spayne, and in shorte tyme arriued at <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em>,
<em class="italic">Cortez</em> hauing newes of their arriuall by foote postes
within two dayes. And vppon Midsomer day came letters
to <em class="italic">Cortes</em> from the Licenciate <em class="italic">Ponce</em>, with another
letter from the Emperour, wherby he vnderstood y<sup>e</sup> cause
of their comming. He returned backe incontinēt an aunswere,
and desired to know which way he would come to
<em class="italic">Mexico</em>, eyther by y<sup>e</sup> way inhabited, or else the other way
which is néerer. The Licenciate replyed, that he woulde
for a while abide in <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em>, to refresh himselfe, béeyng
seasicke, and a man y<sup>t</sup> had not heeretofore at any time passed
the seas, thinking that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> meante to haue done iustice
on certain offenders, yea &#38; also to haue takē hym by
the way: wherefore he suspected, that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> had sent, bycause
he woulde knowe whiche way he meant to come,
wherevpon he secretely tooke post horse, with certaine
Gentlemē, and other religious persons that came in hys
company, &#38; passed through the Townes, although it was
the farther way, and made suche hast, that in fiue dayes
he came to <em class="italic">Iztacpallapan</em>, refusing the entertaynement and
prouision of meate and lodging that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> had prepared
by his Gentlemē, that wēt both the wayes to méete him.</p>

<p>In <em class="italic">Iztacpallapā</em> they receyued him with great feast and
maiestie, but after dinner, the Licenciate fell a vomiting,
and the most of hys companye, and after the vomite,
they fell into a flixe. They thoughte that certayne
hearbes was the cause thereof, whiche were in a dishe
of curdes. The Licenciate was somewhat gréedie of the
curdes, and tooke the dishe, and offered it to father
<em class="italic">Thomas Ortiz</em>, no (quoth the Stewarde) hys reuerence
shall haue another dishe, no (quoth father <em class="italic">Ortiz</em>) I will
none of these, nor yet of anye other, of whyche wordes
there were afterwardes Verses made, suspecting somethyng
of the curdes: but truely there was no hurte,
or anye euill thyng putte in them, (as héereafter
shalbe declared) for the <em class="italic">Comendador</em>, <em class="italic">Proano</em>, who was then
chiefe Sheriffe, did eate of all those dishes, yea in the same
dishe that the Licenciat eate of, who neyther vomited
nor yet receyued any hurte or alteration. But I thinke,
that they cōmyng hoate, wery and hungry, did eate too
muche, and dranke also colde water, whereby their stomackes
reuolted, and thereof followed the flixe with vomite.
On the behalfe of <em class="italic">Cortes</em> there was presented to the
Licenciat a riche present, but he refused it.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> with al the flower of Gentlemen in <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, came
to receyue him, and giuyng him the right hand, they went
togyther vntill they came to <em class="italic">Sainct Frances</em> abbay, where
after their praiers made, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> demaūded to sée the kings
prouisions, who answered, that the nexte day he woulde
shew them vnto him: then they accompanied him to his
house, where he was well lodged.</p>

<p>The nexte day followyng, all the magistrates of the
Cittie mette the Licentiat in the cathedrall Church, and
by acte, before the notary, he presented his auctoritie from
the Emperour. He tooke the Vares of Iustice from the
Iudges and Sargeants, and incontinent restored them agayne,
and saide with gentle speach, this rodde of the Senior
gouernour, I will haue for my selfe. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> with all
the other Magistrates kissed the Emperours letters, and
put them vpon the crowne of their heads, in tokē of great
obedience, saying, that they woulde obserue and obey all
that was therein contayned, as the commaundement of
their king and Lorde, requyring the same to be set downe
by acte and testimony.</p>

<p>After these things done, they proclaymed the residence
and account of iustice, of <em class="italic">Hernando Cortes</em>, to the intent that
all persons who coulde accuse him of any vnrightful dealing,
should come and make their complaint, and to haue
remedy for the same. There should you then sée the stirre
and talke among them, euery officer fearyng his owne
cause, with desire to sée the ende of their businesse.</p>

The Licenciat comming one day from <em class="italic">Saint
Frances</em> abbay from seruice, fell into an extréeme
burnyng feuer, and lay him downe
in his bedde, where he remayned the space
of thrée dayes, as a man out of his wittes,
and the feuer stil encreasing, so that on the
seuenth day he yéelded vp the ghost. In the time of his
sickenesse he receyued the communion, and made his laste
will &#38; testament. He left for substitute in his office, the bacheler
<em class="italic">Marcus de Aguillar</em>. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> made as greate sorrow
for his death, as if he had bene his owne father, his funeralles
were celebrated with great pompe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A madde daunce.</div>

<p>The enimies of <em class="italic">Cortes</em> published, that he died of poyson.
But the Licenciat <em class="italic">Pero Lopez</em>, and Doctor <em class="italic">Hoieda</em>, who
were his Phisitions, swore that he died of a burnyng feuer,
and shewed a further consequence, that the euenyng
before he deceased, he desired them to play the measures
vpon a lute, and as he lay in his bedde, shewed with stirryng
his féete the compasses and pointes of the daunce.
It was a thing which diuers persons saw, and forthwith
he lost his speach, and that night towarde the dawning of
the day he yéelded vp his spirite. I thinke that fewe men
do die daūsing, as this Lawier did. The number of a hundred
persons came out of Spayne with the Licenciat,
whereof the moste parte died by sea and on the lande. It
was suspected to be a pestilence, for one of them infected
another. There were in his company many Gentlemen
&#38; ech of them had an office. There was a Frier who was
a very slaunderous fellow, &#38; reported that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> had poysoned
the Licenciat, and also that the Licenciat had an expresse
order from the Emperour to cut of <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his head,
as sone as he had taken the Vare of Iustice from him.

Where one <em class="italic">Alonso de Estrada</em> gouerned the
state of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, as substitute of <em class="italic">Marcus de
Aguillar</em>, accordying to the Emperours
commaundement, <em class="italic">Cortes</em> considered with
himselfe that it was not possible for him
to haue agayne his office, except he wente
personally to the Emperours court, where he had many
aduersaries and fewe friendes, so that he was afflicted on
euery side: yet he in fine determined to goe into Spayne,
as well for businesse of importaunce of his owne, as also
matters touchyng the Emperour and his new kingdoms
whereof I will reherse particularly some.</p>

<p>As touchyng his owne causes, first he beyng a man of
good yéeres, went to marry, hoping to haue children, vnto
whom he might leaue the profite of his labour and payne:
also to appeare before the King his maister face to face,
and to enforme his Maiestie what landes and Kyngdomes
hée had wonne and brought vnto his royall
crowne: To signifie lykewise vnto hym, of the dissention
among the Spanyardes hys subiectes in <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,
and to answere for himselfe, to any false reportes whiche
had bene made agaynst hym: And finally, to receyue
a condigne rewarde for hys worthie and faythfull seruice.
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> beyng in these imaginations, there was
brought a letter vnto him, from the reuerend father <em class="italic">Garcia
de Loaisa</em> ghostly father vnto the Emperour, and afterwarde
was ordeyned Cardinall, in the whiche letter he
conuited him earnestly to come vnto Spayne, to the entent
that the Emperours Maiestie mighte bothe sée and
know him, assuring him of his friendshippe. After the receyte
of this letter, he made al the hast possible to departe
vpon his iourney, ceasing from his voyage whiche he had
in hande, for to inhabite the riuer <em class="italic">De las Palmas</em>. Before
his departure he dispatched twoo hundred Spaniardes, &#38;
thrée score and ten horsemen, with many <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> for the
countrey of <em class="italic">Chichimea</em>, to inhabite there, finding the lande
riche of siluer mines, as it was reported, giuyng vnto
those men expresse order, that if the people of that prouince
did not entertayne them with friendship, that then
they should accept thē as enimies, and forthwith to make
warre, and to take them for slaues, for that they are a barbarous
people. He wrote his letter to <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em>, to prepare
with all spéede twoo good shippes, and for that purpose
he sent <em class="italic">Pero ruiz de Esquiuel</em>, who was a Gentleman
of Siuill: But he wente not on the iourney, for a moneth
after, they founde him buried in a little Iland of the lake,
with one hande out of the graue, whiche was eaten with
dogges and foule: he was buried in his dublet and his
hose: he had one onely wounde in his forehead: And a
<em class="italic">Negro</em>, his slaue, who wente in his company, was neuer
hearde of, nor yet the <em class="italic">Canao</em> and <em class="italic">Indians</em> that wente with
him, so that the truth of his death was neuer knowen.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> made an Inuentary of his moueable goodes,
whiche was valued at twoo hundred thousande Castlins
of golde: he left for gouernour of his owne estate, the Licenciat
<em class="italic">Altamirano</em> his kinsman, with other two friends:
he furnished twoo shippes, and proclaymed frée passage
and victuals vnto all those that would goe in his cōpany:
he shipped for his owne account a thousand fiue hundred
markes of siluer, twentie thousand Castlins in good gold,
and ten thousand Castlins of base golde. He tooke in his
company <em class="italic">Gonsalo de Sandoual</em>, <em class="italic">Andres de Tapia</em>, and other of
the chiefest of the conquerours. He brought with him a
Sonne of <em class="italic">Mutezumas</em>, &#38; another Sonne of <em class="italic">Maxixca</em>, who
was become a Christian, &#38; named <em class="italic">Don Lorenso</em>, with many

cities: eight players with a cudgell, twelue tenis players,
with certaine men &#38; women of that countrey, who were
white of colour, and other dwarfes &#38; deformed persons.
He brought also wilde beasts, as Tigres, &#38; other strange
beastes called <em class="italic">Aiotochtli</em>, and one <em class="italic">Tlaquaci</em>. Moreouer he
brought a great number of mantels made of feathers &#38;
Conny heare, Targets, bushes or tuffes of galant feathers,
and looking glasses of stone. In fine, he came lyke a
great Lorde, &#38; arriued in Spayne, in the ende of the yéere

and coast of the south sea, chiefe discouerer and inhabiter
of the same coaste and Ilandes, with the twelfth
parte of all that after that tyme should be discouered, for
a sure inheritaunce to him and his discendentes: he offered
vnto him also the habite of the order of Knighthoode of
Saint Iames, the whiche offer <em class="italic">Cortes</em> refused, bycause
there was no rent gyuen with the habite, but he besought
his Maiestie to graunt vnto him the gouernmēt of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,
the whiche request the Emperour denied, bycause that
no Conquerour shoulde thinke that the office of gouernment
and iustice is due vnto hym, for the like demaunde
was desired of the king <em class="italic">Don Fernando</em>, by <em class="italic">Cristoual Colon</em>
who firste discouered the <em class="italic">India</em>, and also the great Captaine
<em class="italic">Gonsalo Hernandoz de Cordoua</em>, who conquered <em class="italic">Naples</em>.
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> deserued muche, and also the Emperour gaue
him much, to honour him as a most bountifull and gratefull
King, who neuer taketh away that whiche once he
giueth. He likewise gaue vnto <em class="italic">Cortez</em> all the kyngdome of
<em class="italic">Michuacan</em>, but hée had rather haue had diuers other
townes whiche he demaunded, many other great fauours
and rewardes he receyued at the Emperours handes, but

When it was knowen in Spayne, that the
lady <em class="italic">Catherin Xuares</em>, wife vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, was
deceassed in <em class="italic">India</em>, by intercessours he was
assured vnto the Duke of <em class="italic">Beiar</em>, his brothers
daughter, who was named the Lady
<em class="italic">Iane</em> of <em class="italic">Zuniga</em>: hyr fathers name was <em class="italic">Don
Carolus de Arrellano</em>, Earle of <em class="italic">Aguilar</em>. This Lady was
a bewtifull Dame, and hyr brethrene noble personages,
who were highly in fauour with the Emperour. And
<em class="italic">Cortes</em> to matche with so honorable an house and lynage
he iudged himselfe fortunate and well maried.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The riche Emeraldes.</div>

<p>Among many Iewelles whiche <em class="italic">Cortes</em> broughte with
him, were fiue moste riche and fine Emeraldes, whiche
were valued at a hundreth thousande Duckets: the one
was wrought lyke vnto a Rose, an other like a Cornet,
an other lyke a fishe with the eyes of golde, whiche was
a maruellous péece of worke, beyng wrought among <em class="italic">Indians</em>:
an other péece was wrought lyke vnto a bell, with
a great and a riche pearle for the clapper, garnished with
golde, ingrauen about with letters, whiche sayde, Blessed
is he that created thée. The fifth was made lyke a cuppe
with the foote of gold, and had foure little chaynes of gold,
that were ioyned all at the top togither, in a great pearle,
and the brimme of this cuppe was of gold, with this verse
ingrauen rounde aboute, <em class="italic">Inter nates mulierum non furrexit
maior</em>. For this onely péece the Merchantes of <em class="italic">Geneua</em> did
offer fourtie thousand Ducates, for to sel the same again
to the great Turke. But at that tyme <em class="italic">Cortes</em> woulde not
giue it for any money, although afterwarde he lost them
all in the warres of <em class="italic">Argel</em>, beyng there with the Emperour.
It was told <em class="italic">Cortes</em> that the Empresse desired to haue
those péeces, meaning to demaunde them of him, and that
the Emperour shoulde pay for the same, for whiche cause
he sent them to the Lady his newe wife, with many other
Iewelles before he came at the Courte, and there, when
he was enquired for them, he answered, and excused himselfe,
for then certaynely he gaue suche Iewels vnto his
Espouse, that the lyke neuer Lady had in Spayne. And
after he was maried to the Lady <em class="italic">Iane</em> of <em class="italic">Zuniga</em>, he departed

Before <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his cōming into Spayne,
<em class="italic">Pamfilo de Naruaez</em> his old enimy wēt
vp &#38; down in the Court, procuring the
conquest of the riuer <em class="italic">De Palmas</em> &#38; <em class="italic">Florida</em>,
where at the laste he died, and alwayes
when he saw time conuenient
he made cōplaints against <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, yea
and to the Emperours owne hand he deliuered a scrole of
many articles, amōg the which was one, wherein he affirmed
that <em class="italic">Cortes</em> had as many barres of gold and siluer, as
in <em class="italic">Biscay</em> were barres of yron, and offered to proue the
same: but although it was not true, yet it was suspicious.
He also earnestly procured that he shold be punished, saying
that he had plucked out one of his eyes, &#38; killed with
poyson the Licenciat <em class="italic">Luys ponce de Leon</em>, &#38; <em class="italic">Francisco Garay</em>.
Through his many and importunate petitiōs, it was determined
to send to <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, <em class="italic">Don Pedro de la Cueua</em>, who was
bothe fierce and seuere, and Lorde stewarde of the Emperour
his house, and afterwarde made general of the ordinance,
and chiefe Comendador of the order and knighthood
of <em class="italic">Alcantara</em>, who findyng the accusation true, should
cut off <em class="italic">Cortes</em> his head.</p>

<p>But as God would, in the meane season came the testimoniall
from the Doctor <em class="italic">Hoieda</em>, and the Licenciat <em class="italic">Pero
Lopez</em>, Phisitions, who had cured the persons that were reported
to haue bene poysoned, whervpon that commission
ceased. And when <em class="italic">Cortes</em> came into Spayne, <em class="italic">Don Pedro de

From farre places long lies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Before the Iudges came, Cortez vvas gone to Spayne.</div>

<p>The Emperour and his councell of <em class="italic">India</em> prouided a
Courte of Chancery in <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, as chiefe place, where as
all controuersies and matters of righte throughout the
new <em class="italic">Spayne</em> mighte there be determined, and also to correct
the mutinies, and partes taking among the Spanyardes:
likewise to take residence and accompte of <em class="italic">Cortes</em>,
and to be satisfyed both of his seruice and offences.
Moreouer that they should visite the officers, and royall
Treasorie there. <em class="italic">Munio de Gusman</em> was appoynted president
and gouernoure, with other foure Licenciates for
Iudges to accompany him. He departed toward <em class="italic">Mexico</em>
Anno 1529. and at his comming, he began to vnderstande
in his regimente and office, with the Licenciate <em class="italic">Iohn Ortiz</em>,
for the other thrée Iudges died by the way. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> béeing
nowe absente, and vppon his iourney toward <em class="italic">Spayne</em>,
this newe Iudge made a terrible residence and condemnation
againste him, and commaunded all his goodes to
be solde by out-thrappe, for a greate deale lesse then hys
goodes were worth, and in his absence they called him by
Proclamation: but if he hadde bin there present, his life
had bin in daunger, although face to face some respect is
had, and it is an ordinarie rule that the Iudge sheweth rigoure
against him that is absent. This hatred was not
only against <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, but also againste his friendes, for hée
apprehended <em class="italic">Pedro de Aluarado</em>, who was newly come
from <em class="italic">Spayne</em>, bycause he spake in the fauour of <em class="italic">Cortez</em>, laying
to his charge the rebellion of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, when <em class="italic">Naruaez</em>
was there. He also apprehended <em class="italic">Alonso de Estrada</em>, &#38; manye
others, doing manifest wrongs vnto them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A good sentence.</div>

<p>In shorte space the Emperour had more complayntes
against <em class="italic">Nunio de Gusman</em>, and the other Iudge, than had
bin héeretofore againste any other, wherevpon he was
put out of office in the yeare 1530. His wrongful dealing
in iustice was not onely proued in <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, but also in
the Court of <em class="italic">Spayne</em>, with many persons that were come
from thence, so that the nexte president and Iudges that
went thither, did pronounce <em class="italic">Nunio de Gusman</em> and his fellowe
for partiall Iudges, and enimies vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, and
condemned him to pay all his goodes whiche were euill
solde. But whē <em class="italic">Nunio de Gusman</em> vnderstoode that he was
put out of office, he then was afraide, and tooke his iourney
against the <em class="italic">Teuchichimecas</em>, séeking after the Towne
of <em class="italic">Culhuacan</em>, from whence the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> descended. He caried
in his company fiue hundred Spanyardes, whereof
the most were horsemen, and many of them went as prisoners,
and against their willes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Abhominable fact.</div>

<p>In <em class="italic">Mechuacan</em> he tooke prisoner the King <em class="italic">Caconcin</em>, who
was a great friende vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, a seruitor vnto the Spanyards,
and vassal to the Emperour, and as the same goeth,
he tooke from him tenne thousande markes of plate,
and much golde, and afterward burned him, and many other
Gentlemen, and principal persons of that kingdome,
bycause they shoulde not complayne, saying, that a dead
dogge biteth not. He tooke from thence sixe thousand <em class="italic">Indians</em>
for the seruice of his army, and with them conquered
<em class="italic">Xalixco</em>, whiche is nowe called the new <em class="italic">Gallizia</em>. He abode
there, vntill the Vizeroy <em class="italic">Don Antonio de Mondoza</em>,
and Chancery of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, caused him to be apprehended,
who sent him prisoner into Spayne, to giue accompte of
his office. If <em class="italic">Nunio de Gusman</em> had bin so good a gouernour
and Iudge, as he was in bloud a Gentleman, he had then
enioyed the best plot of all the West <em class="italic">India</em>, but he behaued
himselfe euill, both with the <em class="italic">Indians</em> and <em class="italic">Spanyards</em>.</p>

<p>The same yeare that he came from <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, went thyther
for president <em class="italic">Sebastian Ramirez</em>, who was a Bishop,
and had in time past bin presidente in <em class="italic">Santo Domingo</em>, and
the Licenciates <em class="italic">Iohn de Salmeron</em>, <em class="italic">Gasco Quiroga</em>, <em class="italic">Francisco
Ceynos</em>, and <em class="italic">Alonso Maldonado</em>, for Iudges to accompany
him.</p>

<p>These Iudges gouerned well the land, and caused the
Citie of <em class="italic">Angels</em> to be inhabited which the <em class="italic">Indians</em> called
<em class="italic">Cuetlaxcoapan</em>, that is to say a Snake in water. The reason
was, bycause they haue two fountaynes, the one of euill
water, and the other of good. This Citie standeth
twentie leagues from <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, in the high way to <em class="italic">Vera
Crux</em>. The Bishop set the <em class="italic">Indians</em> at libertie, and therefore
many Spanyards departed from thence, who hadde
inhabited there before, and wente to séeke their liuing at
<em class="italic">Xalixco</em>, <em class="italic">Hunduras</em>, <em class="italic">Quahutemallan</em>, and other places where

At this season arriued <em class="italic">Cortes</em> at the riche
Towne of <em class="italic">Vera Crux</em>, and when his comming
was published, how he came wyth
title of Marquez, and had broughte hys
wife with him, an infinite number of <em class="italic">Indians</em>
came to visite him, and almost all
the Spanyards of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, so that in few dayes there came
a thousand persons of his owne nation, who made theyr
complaintes vnto him, how they were vndone, and that
the Iudges which had bin there, had destroyed both him
and them, and asked his iudgement whether that nowe
they might kill both them and theirs. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> hearing their
odious request, reprehended them, and also gaue them
hope shortly to reléeue their necessitie with new discoueries,
and in this order fearing some mutinie, he held them
in pleasure and pastime.</p>

<p>When the president hearde howe <em class="italic">Cortes</em> was visited of
the Spanyaryds, they commaunded forthwith euery one
of them shoulde immediately returne to <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, or else,
where their dwelling places were vpō paine of death, yea
and they were aboute to apprehende <em class="italic">Cortes</em> for a stirrer
of vprore, and to sende him backe againe prisoner into
<em class="italic">Spayne</em>. But when he saw howe soone these Iudges were
moued, he commaunded to proclayme himselfe openly in
<em class="italic">Vera Crux</em> Captayne Generall of all the dominions of
the new <em class="italic">Spayne</em>, and there caused the Emperours letters
pattentes to be redde, whiche thing being knowen to the
<em class="italic">Mexican</em> Iudges, it caused them to wring their noses. After
this diligence ended, he departed toward <em class="italic">Mexico</em> wyth
a great company of <em class="italic">Spanyards</em> and <em class="italic">Indians</em>, among whom
were a good company of horsemen: but when he came to
<em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>, the President sent to commaund him not to enter
into <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, vpon payne of losse of his goodes, and hys
body to be at the Kings pleasure.</p>

<p>He obeyed the commaundemente with greate wysedome,
being a thing conuenient to the seruice of the Emperour,
and profite of the land, which he had wonne wyth
great toyle and laboure: but yet he abode in <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em> with
a greater maiestie and court, than the President in <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,
and wrote vnto him, that he should consider his good
will and whole intent, and not to giue occasion to the <em class="italic">Indians</em>
to rebell, and for the <em class="italic">Spanyards</em> he might assure hymselfe.</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">Indians</em> vnderstāding y<sup>e</sup> discord betwixt the President
and <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, slew as many Spanyards as they coulde
get at aduantage, so that in fewe dayes there wanted aboue
two hundred of the Spanish nation, being slayne as
well in Townes, as in the high wayes, yea and also they
had communed among themselues to rebell in déede. But
when the Bishop and the Iudges heard this newes, they
began to feare the matter, and considering that they had
no better remedy, nor other sure defence, but only y<sup>e</sup> name
valor, person, and authoritie of <em class="italic">Cortes</em>, they sente to desire
him to come vnto <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, wherevpon he obserued theyr
commaundement and request, &#38; wente toward the Citie,
well accompanyed with men of warre, so that he shewed
himselfe in estate a generall captaine. All the Citizens
came out to receiue him and the lady Marques his wife:
his entrie into the cittie was a day of great pleasure among
them. Then the president and iudges entred into
counsell for to remedie the greate hurt whiche had bene
done by the <em class="italic">Indians</em>. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> toke the matter in hand, and
apprehended many <em class="italic">Indians</em>, of whom some he burned, others
wer torne with dogges, he did such correction, that
in shorte time al the countrey was quiet, and the highe
ways without daunger, a thing worthy of great thanks.</p>

euery moneth beginneth not with <em class="italic">Cipactli</em>, which is

make two and fiftie yeares, which is a perfit number in
the reconing, and is called the yeare of grace, for from
fiftie two yeres, to fiftie two yeares, they vsed to make
solemne feastes, with strange Ceremonies, as hereafter
shall be declared. And when fiftie two yeares are ended,
then they beginne againe, by the same order before declared,
vntil they come to as many moe, beginning at <em class="italic">Ce

Conny figure. So that in the forme of reconing they kepe

Cronicle they know in what yere euerye thing hapned,

The <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Culhua</em> did beléeue that the
Gods had made y<sup>e</sup> world, but they knew
not how, yet they beléeued that since the
creation of the world four Sunnes were
past, and that the fift and last is y<sup>e</sup> Sunne
that now giueth light to the world.</p>

<p>They helde opinion that the firste Sunne perished by
water, and at the same time all liuing creatures perished
likewise.</p>

<p>The second Sunne (say they) fell from the heauēs, with
whose fall all liuing creatures were slayne, and then (said
they) were manye Giantes in that Countrey, and certayne
monstrous bones, which our men found in opening
of graues, by proportion whereof, some shoulde séeme to
be men of twenty spannes high.</p>

<p>The third Sunne was consumed by fire, whiche burned
day and night, so that then all liuing creatures were
burned.</p>

<p>The fourth Sunne finished by tempest of ayre or
winde, which blew downe houses, trées, yea and y<sup>e</sup> mountaynes
and Rockes were blowē asunder, but the lignage
of mankinde perished not, sauing that they were conuerted
into Apes. And touching the fift Sunne, which now
raigneth, they know not how it shall consume. But they
say that when the fourth Sunne perished, all the worlde
fell into darkenesse, and so remained for the space of fiue
and twenty yeares continually, and at the fiftenth yeare
of that fearefull darkenesse, the Gods did forme one man
and a woman, who brought forth children, and at the end
of the other tenne yeares, appeared the Sunne whiche
was newly borne vppon the figure of the <em class="italic">Conny</em> day, and
therfore they begin their account of yéeres at y<sup>t</sup> day, &#38; reckoning
from the yeare of oure Lorde 1552. their age or
Sunne is 858. so that it appeareth that they haue vsed
many yeares their writing in figures: and they had not
onely this vse from <em class="italic">Cetochtli</em>, whiche is the beginning of
their yeare, moneth, and day of their fifth Sunne, but also
they hadde the same order and vse in the other foure
Sunnes which were past: but they let many things slippe
out of memorie, saying, that with the newe Sunne, all other
things should be likewise new. They held also opinion,
that thrée dayes after this last Sunne appeared, all
the Gods did dye, and that in processe of time the Gods
whiche nowe they haue, and worshippe, were borne. And
through these false opinions, our Diuines did soone conuert
them to the knowledge of the true lawes of God.</p>

In the lande nowe called newe <em class="italic">Spayne</em>, are dyuers
and sundry generations of people: but
they holde opinion, that the stocke of most antiquitie,
is the people nowe called <em class="italic">Chichimecas</em>,
which procéeded out of the house of <em class="italic">Aculhuacan</em>,
which standeth beyond <em class="italic">Xalixco</em>, about the yeare
of our Lorde .720. Many of this Generation did inhabite
aboute the lake of <em class="italic">Tenuchtitlan</em>, but their name ended by
mixture in marriage with other people. At that time
they hadde no King, nor yet did builde eyther house or
Towne. Their only dwellings was in caues in y<sup>e</sup> Moūtaynes.
They went naked, they sowed no kind of graine,
nor vsed bread of any sorte. They did mainteyne themselues
with rootes, hearbes, and siluester fruites: and béeing
a people cunning in shooting with the bowe, they kylled
deare, hares, connyes, and other beastes and foule,
which they eate also, not sodden or rosted, but rawe, and
dryed in the Sunne. They eate also Snakes, Lizardes,
and other filthye beastes, yea and at this day there are
some of this generation that vse the same dyet. But although
they liued suche a bestiall life, &#38; being a people so
barbarous, yet in their diuelish religion they were verye
deuout. They worshipped the Sunne, vnto whome they
vsed to offer Snakes, Lizards, &#38; such other beasts. They
likewise offered vnto their God all kinde of foule, from
the degrée of an Eagle, to a little Butterflie. They vsed
not sacrifice of māslaughter, nor had any Idolles, no not
so muche as of the Sunne, whome they helde for the sole
and only God. They married but with one woman, &#38; in
no degrée of kinred. They were a stoute and a warlike
people, by reason whereof, they were Lordes of the land.</p>

Although one brother was heire to an other
among the <em class="italic">Mexicans</em>, and after their
deceasse, did inherite the Sonne of the
eldest brother, yet they tooke no possession
of the state nor name of King vntil they
were annoynted and Crowned openlye.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The oyntment.</div>

<p>As soone as any King of <em class="italic">Mexico</em> deceassed, and his funerals
ended, then were called to Parliamente the Lorde
of <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>, and the Lorde of <em class="italic">Tlacopan</em>, who were the chiefest
estates, and then in order all other noble men, who
owed any seruice to the Mexican Empire. And béeyng
come togither, if any doubt of the inheritāce of y<sup>e</sup> crowne
happened, then the matter was decided with al hast: then
the newe King being knowen, he was stripped starke naked,
except a cloth to couer his priuie partes, and in thys
sorte was carried among them, to the greate Temple
of <em class="italic">Vitzilopuchtli</em> with greate silence, and without any ioy
or pleasure: Two Gentlemen of the Citie whose office
it was, ledde him vppe the staires of the Temple by the
armes, and before him wente the Princes of <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em> and
<em class="italic">Tlacopan</em>, who that day did weare their robes of Coronation,
wherevpon was paynted their armes and title. Verye
fewe of the Laytie wente vp into the Chappels, but
only those that were appoynted to attire the newe king,
and to serue in other Ceremonies, for all the residue
stoode vpon the steppes and belowe, to beholde the Coronation.
These Magistrates being aboue in the Chappell,
came with great humilitie and reuerence, knéelyng
downe vpō their knées before the Idoll of <em class="italic">Vitzilopuchtli</em>,
and touched the earth with one finger and then kissed the
same. Then came the high prieste clothed in his pontificall
vestmentes, with many others in his company, who
did weare surplices: and withoute speaking any worde,
they paynted or couloured the Kings person, with ynke
made for the purpose, as blacke as any cole. After thys
Ceremonye done, they blessed the annoynted Kyng, and
sprinckled him foure times with a certayne holly water,
that was made at the time of consecration of the God,
made of dowe or paste, with a sprinckle made of boughes
of Cane leaues, Ceder, &#38; willow leaues. Then they put
vpon his head, a cloth painted with the bones and skulles
of dead men, and next they clothed him with a black garment,
and vpon y<sup>t</sup> another blewe, and both were paynted
with y<sup>e</sup> figures of dead mens skulles &#38; bones. Then they
put about his necke certaine laces, whereat did hang the
armes of y<sup>e</sup> Crowne. And behind his backe they did hang
certain little bottels ful of powders, by vertue wherof he
was deliuered from pestilence and diseases, according to
their opiniō: yea &#38; therby witches, nor witchcrafts could
not hurt him, nor yet euill menne deceyue him. In fyne,
with those relickes he was sure from all perill and daunger.
Vpon his lefte arme they bounde a litle bagge of incense,
and then brought vnto him a chaffyng dishe of imbers
made of the barke of an Oke trée. Then the king arose,
and with his owne hande threw of the same incense
into the chaffing dishe, and with great reuerence brought
the same to the God <em class="italic">Vitzilopuchtli</em>, and after he had smoked
him therewith, he satte him downe, then came the
high Priest and tooke his othe to mainteyne the religion
of the Goddes, to kéepe also all the lawes and customes of
his predecessours, to maynteyne iustice, and not to agrauiate
any of his vassals or subiects, and that he should be
valiant in the warres, that he shoulde cause the Sunne to
giue his light, the clowdes to yéelde rayne, the riuers to
runne, and the earth to bring foorth all kinde of grayne,
fruytes, and other néedefull hearbes and trées. These and
many other impossible things the newe kyng did sweare
to performe: and then he gaue thankes to the high priest,
and commended himself to the Goddes and to the lookers
on, and they who brought him vp in the same order, carrieth
him downe agayne. Then all the people cried, the
Goddes preserue the newe kyng, and that he may raigne
many yéeres in health with al his people. But then some
began to daunce, other to play on their instrumēts, shewing
outwardly their inwarde ioyes of harte. And before
the king came to the foote of the steppes, all the noble men
came to yéelde their obedience, and in token of louing and
faythfull subiectes they presented vnto him feathers,
strings of snayle shelles, collours, and other Iewelles of
golde and siluer, also mantels paynted with death, &#38; bare
him company vnto a great hal within the compasse of the
temple, and there lefte him. The king sitteth downe vnder
his cloth of estate, called <em class="italic">Tlacatecco</em>, and in foure daies
departeth not out of the circuyte of the temple, the which
he spendes in prayers, sacrifice and penaunce, he eates
then but once a day, and euery day he bathes himselfe,
and agayne in the night in a great ponde of water, and
then lettes himselfe bloud in his eares, and senseth therewith
the God of Water, called <em class="italic">Tlaloc</em>: he likewise senseth
the other idols, vnto whome he offereth bread, flowers,
Papers and little Canes died in the bloudde of his owne
tongue, nose, handes, and other partes of his body. After
the foure dayes expired, then come all the Noblemen to
beare him company to his palayce with great triumphe
and pleasure of all the Cittie, but after his consecration
fewe or none dare looke him in the face.</p>

<p>And now with the declaryng of the actes and Ceremonies
that the <em class="italic">Mexican</em> Kings are crowned, I shall not
néede to rehearse of other kyngs, for generally they all do
vse the same order, sauyng that other Princes goe not vp
to the toppe of the Temple, but abide at the foote of the
steppes to be crowned, and after theyr Coronation they
come to <em class="italic">Mexico</em> for their confirmation, and then at theyr
returne to their countrey, they made many drunkē feasts
and banquets.</p>

The <em class="italic">Mexicans</em> did beléeue that the Soule
was immortal, and that they receyued eyther
ioy or payne according to theyr desertes
&#38; liuyng in this worlde, vnto which
opinion all their religion did attayne, and
chiefly appeare at their burials. They
helde for an assured faith, that there were nine places appointed
for soules, &#38; the chiefest place of glory to be neare
vnto the Sunne, where the soules of those whiche were
good men slaine in the warres, &#38; those which were sacrifised
were placed, and that all other sortes of euill persons
their soules abode on the earth, &#38; were deuided after this
sorte, children that were dead borne went to one place,
those which died of age or other disease went to another,
those which died of sodden death to another, those whiche
died of woundes or contagious diseases went to an other
place, those which were drowned went to another, those
which were put to death for offence by order of iustice, as
for robbery and adultery to another: Those which slewe
their fathers, mothers, wiues or childrē, to another place
by themselues, also those who slew their maysters or any
religious person went to another place. The common
sorte of people were buried, but Lordes and rich men had
their bodies burned &#38; their ashes buried. In their shreudes
they had a greate difference, for many dead bodies were
buried better apparelled than when they were on liue.
Women were shrewded after another sorte. And he that
suffered death for adulterie was shrewded like vnto the
God of leachery, called <em class="italic">Tlazoulteutl</em>, he that was drowned
like vnto the God of water named <em class="italic">Tlacoc</em>, and he that died
with drunkennesse was shrewded like vnto the God of
wyne called <em class="italic">Ometochtli</em>. But the Souldier had an honorable
shrewde like vnto the attyre of <em class="italic">Vitzilopuchtli</em>, and the
lyke order in all other sortes of deathes.</p>

When any Kyng of <em class="italic">Mexico</em> happened to
fall sicke, they vsed forth-with to put a
visor vppon the face of <em class="italic">Tezcatlipuca</em>, or
<em class="italic">Vitzilopuchtli</em>, or some other Idoll,
whiche Visor was not taken awaye,
vntill they sawe whether the kyng did amend, or else die:
But if he chaunsed to die, then worde was sent throughout
all his dominions to bewaile his death, and also other
postes were sent to call the Noble menne that were his
nighest kinsmen, and to warne them within foure dayes
to come vnto his buriall.</p>

<p>The dead body was layde vpon a fayre matte, &#38; was
watched foure nightes, with great lamētation and mournyng:
then the body was washed, and a locke of heare
cut from the crowne of his head, whiche was preserued
as a great relicke, saying that therein remayned the remembrance
of his soule. This done, a fine Emerald was
put into his mouth, and his body shrewded in seuentene
riche mantles, of colours, both riche and costly wrought.
Vpon the vpper mantle was sette the deuise or armes of
<em class="italic">Vitzilopuchtli</em> or <em class="italic">Tezcalipuca</em>, or of some other idoll, in
whome the kyng had greate confidence in his lyfe tyme,
and in his temple should the body be buried. Vpō his face
they put a visor, paynted with foule and Diuelish gestures,
besette with many iewelles, precious stones, and
pearles. Then they killed his slaue, whose office was to
light the Lampes and make fire vnto the Goddes of his
pallayce. These things done, they carried the dead body
vnto the Temple: some followed him with dolefull tune,

custome.</p>

<p>The Noble men and Gentlemen of his housholde carried
Targets, Arrowes, Maces, and Ensignes to throwe
into the fire where the body should be buried in the Temple.
The high Priest and all the Clergie receyued him at
the Temple gate, with a sorrowfull song, and after he
had sayde certayne wordes, the body was throwen into a
great fire made for the purpose, with all the iewels that
he had aboute him, and all the other things whiche was
brought to honour the burial: also a dogge newly strangled
with an arrowe, whiche was to guyde him his way.
In the meane whyle that the King and dogge were
burnyng, the Priests sacrificed twoo hūdred persons, howbeit
in this Ceremonie there was no ordinary taxe, for
sometymes they sacrificed many moe: they were opened
with a rasour of flinte in the breastes, and theyr hartes
taken out and throwen into the fire where the Kings body
was. There miserable persons beyng sacrificed, and
their bodies throwen into a hole, they beléeued assuredly
that those shoulde serue for his slaues in another worlde:
some of them were dwarffes, monstrous and deformed
persons, with some women. They placed about the dead
body of the King before his buriall, Roses, Floures and
sundry dishes of meate and drinke, and no creature durste
touche the same, but onely y<sup>e</sup> Priests, for it séemed to be an
offeryng.</p>

<p>The nexte day followyng, all the ashes were gathered
togither, and the téeth with the Emerald that was in his
mouth, the whiche things were put into a chest, paynted
on the inside with horrible figures of diuels, and the locke
of heare whiche was cut from his crowne, and another
locke of heare which was preserued from the tyme of his
birth. Then the chest was lockte, and an image of wood
made and clothed like vnto the Kings person, which was
set on the toppe of the chest. The obsequies endured foure
dayes, in the whiche the wiues and daughters of the king
offered great offerings at the place where his body was
buried, and before the chest and his image.</p>

<p>On the fourth day after the buriall, fiftene slaues
were sacrificed for his soule, and on the twentith day other
fiue persons were also sacrificed, likewise on the sixtie
thrée, and fourescore, whiche was lyke vnto the yéeres
minde.</p>

The kingdome of <em class="italic">Michuacan</em> is almoste as
great as the Empire of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and when
any king of that countrey happened to be
visited with sicknesse, and brought to suche
extremitie, that hope of life were past, according
to the opinion of Phisitions, then would he name
and appoint whiche of his Sonnes shoulde inherite the estate,
and beyng knowen, the new king or heyre, incontinent
sent for all the gouernours, Captaines, and valiant
souldiers, who had any office or charge to come vnto the
buriall of his Father, and he that came not, from thencefoorth
was helde for a Traytour and so punished. When
the death of the olde King was certayne, then came al degrées
of Estates and brought presents to the newe king,
for the approbation of his kyngdome, but if the King
were not throughly dead, but at the poynt of death, then
the gates were shut in, and none permitted to enter, and
when hys lyfe was departed, then beganne a generall
crie and mournyng, and they were permitted to come
where their dead kyng lay, and to touche him with their
handes: this beyng done the carkasse was washed with
swéete waters, and then a fine shyrte put vpon him, and a
payre of shoes made of a Déere skinne put on his féete,
and aboute his ancles were tied certayne belles of golde,
about his wrestes of his handes were put Manyllias of
Turkies, and other bracelets of golde, lykewise aboute
his necke they hong other collers of precious stones and
golde, and rings in his eares, with greate Turkise in
his neather lippe. Then his body was layde vpon a large
beare, whereon was placed a good bedde vnder him: on
his one side lay a bowe with a quyuer of arrowes, and on
his other side lay an image made of fine mantels of his
owne stature or bignesse with a greate tuffe of fine feathers,
shoes vpon his féete, with bracelets and a coller of
gold. Whyle this worke was a doyng, others were busied
in washyng the men and women whiche shoulde be
slayne for to accōpany him into Hell: these wretched folke
that should be slaine were banqueted &#38; filled with drinke,
bycause they shoulde receyue their death with lesse paine.
The newe kyng did appoint those who shoulde die for to
serue the king his father, but yet many of them had rather
bene without his seruice, notwithstanding some simple
soules estéemed that odious death for a thyng of immortall
glory. First seuen Gentlewomen of noble parentage
were appoynted to die, the one to haue the office
of keper of his iewels which he was wont to were, another
for the office of cup bearer, another to giue him water
with a basen and ewer, another to giue him alwayes
the vrinall, another to be his Cooke, and another to serue
for landres. They slewe also many women slaues, and
frée maydens for to attende vpon the Gentlewomen, and
moreouer one of euery occupation within the citie. When
all these that were appoynted to die were washed &#38; theyr
bellies full with meate &#38; drinke, then they paynted their
faces yellow, and put garlandes of swéete floures vpon
each of their heads. Then they went in order of processiō
before the beare whereon the dead king was caried, some
wente playing on instruments made of snayle shelles, others
played vpon bones and shelles of seaturtils, others
went whistlyng and the most part weping: the Sonnes of
the dead kyng &#38; other noble men carried vpō their shoulders
the beare where y<sup>e</sup> corse lay, &#38; proceded with an easie
pace towarde the Temple of the God <em class="italic">Curicaueri</em>: his kinsmen
went round about the bere, singyng a sorowful song.
The officers and houshold seruants of the Court w<sup>t</sup> other
Magistrates and rulers of iustice bare the Standartes
and diuers other armes.</p>

<p>About midnight they departed in the order aforesayde
out of the Kings palayce with great light of fire brandes
and with a heauy noyse of trumpets and drummes. The
Citizens which dwelt where the corse passed, attended to
make cleane the streate. And when they were come to
the temple, they wente foure tymes rounde about a great
fire made of the woodde of Pine trée, whiche was prepared
to burne y<sup>e</sup> dead body: then the beare was layd vpon
the fire, and in the meane while that the body was burnyng,
they mawled with a clubbe those whiche had the
garlandes, and afterwarde buried them by foure and
foure, as they were apparelled behind the Temple.</p>

<p>The nexte day in the mornyng, the ashes, bones and
Iewels was gathered and layde vpon a riche mantle, the
whiche was carried to the temple gate, where the priests
attended to blesse those Diuelishe relickes, whereof they
made a dowe or paste, and thereof an image whiche was
appareled lyke a man, with a visor on his face, and all other
sortes of Iewels that the dead King was wonte to
weare, so that it séemed a gallant idoll. At the foote of the
temple stayres, they opened a graue ready made, whiche
was square, large, &#38; twoo fadome déepe, it was also hāged
with new mattes rounde about, and a fayre bed therein,
in the whiche a religious man placed the idoll made of
ashes, with his eyes towarde the east parte, and honge
rounde aboute the walles Targets of golde and siluer,
with bow and arrowes, &#38; many gallant tuffes of feathers
with earthen vessels, as pottes, dishes &#38; platters, so that
the graue was filled vp with houshold stuffe, chests couered
with leather, apparell, iewels, meate, drinke, and armour.
This done, the graue was shut vp &#38; made sure with
beames, bordes, and floored with earth on the toppe.</p>

<p>All those Gentlemen which had serued or touched any
thing in the buriall, washed them selues, and wente to
dinner in the Courte or yard of the Kings house without
any table, and hauing dined, they wiped their hands vpon
certayne lockes of Cotton wol, hanging downe their
heads, and not speaking any word, except it were to aske
for drinke. This Ceremonie endured fiue dayes, and in
all that time no fire was permitted to be kindled in the
Citie, except in the Kings house and Temples, nor yet any
corne was ground, or market kept, nor none durst goe
out of their houses, shewing all the sorrow that might be
possible for the death of theyr King.</p>

In <em class="italic">Tlaxcallan</em> and many other Cities, was
vsed as a principall Ceremonie and token
of marriage, that the Bridegrome
and his Bride, against the day of marriage,
had their heads polled, whiche was
to signifie, that from that day forward, al
childishe orders should be laide aside, and from that tyme
new heare myght grow, to declare another kind of lyfe.
The chiefest knotte of marriage vsed in <em class="italic">Michuacan</em> was,
that the Bride doe looke directly vppon hir spouse, for otherwise
the Matrimony was not perfite nor auaylable.</p>

<p>In <em class="italic">Mixteoapan</em> which is a greate prouince, they vse to
carrie the Bridgrome to be married vpon their backes,
which is to be vnderstoode, that he goeth against his wil,
but yet they take hands, in token that the one shall helpe
the other, and then they knitte both their mantels togyther
with a great knotte, signifying that they ought continually,
while life lasteth, to dwell togither.</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">Indians</em> called <em class="italic">Macatecas</em>, consūme not their Matrimony
in twenty dayes after their marriage, but abide
in fasting and prayer all that while, sacrificing their bodyes,
and annoynting the mouthes of the Idolles wyth
their owne proper bloud.</p>

<p>In <em class="italic">Panuco</em> the husbandes buy their wiues for a bowe,
two arrowes, and a nette, and afterwarde the father in
lawe speaketh not one worde to his sonne in law for the
space of a whole yeare. And when the husbande hapneth
to haue any child, he lyeth not any more with his wife in
two yeares after, for feare least she might be with childe
againe before the former childe were out of daunger,
although some doe sucke vntyll twelue yeares of age,
and for this consideration they haue many wiues. Likewise
there is an order among them, that no woman may
touch or dresse any thing being with theyr menstruall ordinarie.</p>

<p>Diuorcement was not permitted without a iust cause
and authoritie of Iustice, among those who were openly
married, but the other sort might be as easily forsaken as
taken.</p>

<p>In <em class="italic">Mechuacan</em> was not permitted any diuorcemente,
excepte the partie made a solemne othe, that they loked
not the one on the other stedfastly and directly at the
time of their marriage. But in <em class="italic">Mexico</em> they must proue
how the wife is barraine, foule, &#38; of a naughty cōdition:
but if they put away their wiues without order and commaundemente
of the Iudge, then the heare of the offenders
head is burned in the market place, as a shame or
punishment of a man without reason or witte.</p>

<p>The payne of adultery was death, as well for the mā
as the woman: but if the adulterer were a Gentleman,
his head was decked with feathers after that he was hāged,
and his body burned, and for this offence was no
pardon, eyther for man or woman, but for the auoyding
of adultery they do permitte other common women, but
no ordinary stewes.</p>

In <em class="italic">Mexico</em> were twelue Iudges, who were
all noble men, graue, and well learned in
the Mexican lawes. These men liued only
by the rentes that properly apperteyne to
the maintenance of Iustice, and in anye
cause iudged by thē, it was lawfull for the parties to appeale
vnto other twelue Iudges, who were of the princes
bloud, and alwayes abode in the Court, and were
mainteyned at the Kings owne cost and charge. The inferior
Iudges came ordinarily once euery moneth to cōsult
with the higher. And in euery fourescore dayes came
the Iudges of euery prouince within the Mexican Empire,
to consult with the Iudges of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, but all doubtfull
causes were reserued to the King, onely to passe by
his order and determination. The Painters serued for
notaries, to paint al the cases which were to be resolued,
but no sute passed aboue fourescore dayes without finall
ende and determination. There were in that citie twelue
Sergeants, whose office was to arrest, and to cal parties
before the Iudges. Their garments were painted mantels,
wherby they were knowen a farre off. The prisons
were vnder ground, moyst and darke, the cause whereof,
was to put the people in feare to offend. If anye witnesse
were called to take an oth, the order was, that he shoulde
touche the grounde with one of his fingers, and then to
touch his tong with the same, whiche signifyed that hée
had sworne and promised to speake the troth wyth hys
tōg, taking witnes therof, of y<sup>e</sup> earth which did mainteine
him. But some do interprete the oth, y<sup>t</sup> if the partie sware
not true, that then he mighte come to such extremitie, as
to eate earthe. Sometime they name and call vppon the
God of the crime, whose cause the matter touched.</p>

<p>The Iudge that taketh bribes or giftes, is forthwith
put out of his office, whiche was accounted a most vyle
and shamefull reproch. The <em class="italic">Indians</em> did affirme,
that <em class="italic">Necaualpincintli</em>
did hang a Iudge in <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em>, for giuing an
vniust sentence, he himselfe knowing the contrary. The
murther is executed without exception.</p>

<p>The woman with child that wilfully casteth hir creature,
suffereth deathe for the same, bycause many women
did voluntary vse that fact, knowing their children could
not inherite. The punishment of adultery was death.</p>

<p>The Théefe for the firste offence was made a slaue,
and hanged for the second. The traytor to the King and
cōmon weale, was put to death with extreame tormēts.</p>

<p>The woman taken in mans apparel dyed for the same,
and likewise the man taken in womans attire. Euerye
one that challēged another to fight except in the warres,
was cōdemned to die. In <em class="italic">Tezcuco</em> the sinne of <em class="italic">Zodomy</em> was
punished with death, &#38; that law was instituted by <em class="italic">Necaualpincintli</em>,
&#38; <em class="italic">Necaualcoio</em>, who were Iudges, which abhorred
y<sup>e</sup> filthy sinne, &#38; therfore they deserued great praise, for
in other prouinces y<sup>e</sup> abhominable sin was not punished,
although they haue in those places cōmon stewes, as in

At the ende of euery twenty dayes, is celebrated
a festiuall feast called <em class="italic">Tonalli</em>, which
falleth continually the last daye of euerye
moneth, but the chiefest feast in the yeare,
when most men are sacrificed &#38; eaten, is at
the ende of euerye fiftye two yeares. But the <em class="italic">Tlaxcaltecas</em>
and other common weales, do celebrate this feast
euery fourth yeare.</p>

<p>The last day of the first moneth is called <em class="italic">Tlacaxipeualiztli</em>,
on the which day were slaine a hundred slaues,
which were taken in the warres, and after the sacrifise,
their flesh was eaten in this order. Al the Citizens, gathered
themselues togither in the high Temple, and thē
the Ministers or Priestes came and vsed certaine ceremonies,
the which being ended, they toke those whyche
were to be sacrifised, by one and one, and layd them vpon
their backes vpon a large stone, and then the slaue being
on liue, they opened him in the breast, with a knife
made of flinte stone, and toke out his hart, whiche they
threw immediately at the foote of the Aulter, as an offering,
and anoynted with the fresh bloude, the face of the
God <em class="italic">Vitzilopuchtli</em>, or any other Idol. This done, they
pluckt of the skinnes of a certaine number of them, the
which skinnes so many auntient persons put incontinēt
vppon their naked bodies, al fresh &#38; bloudy, as they wer
fleane from the deade carcasses. And being open in the
backe part and shoulders, they vsed to lace them, in such
sorte that they came fitte vppon the bodies of those that
ware them, and being in this order attired, they came
to daunce among many others. In <em class="italic">Mexico</em> the king him
selfe did put on one of these skinnes, being of a principall
captiue, and daunced among the other disguised
persons, to exalte and honor the feast, and an infinite
number followed him to behold his terrible gesture, although
some hold opinion that they followed him to cōtemplate
his greate deuotion. After the sacrifise ended,
the owner of the slaues did carry their bodies home
to their houses, to make of their fleshe a solemne feaste
to all their friendes, leauing their heades and hartes to
the Priests, as their dutie and offering. And the skinnes
were filled with cotten wool, or strawe, to be hong in the
temple, and kings pallayce, for a memorie.</p>

<p>The slaues when they went to their sacrifice, were
apparelled in the habite or deuise of the Idol vnto whom
ech of them did commende himselfe: and moreouer they
decked them with feathers, garlands and floures. Many
of these sort of people, do go to the slaughter with ioyfull
countenannce, dauncing, demaunding almes through
the Citie for their sacrifice, all the whiche almes is due
vnto the priestes. When the gréene corne was a foote aboue
the ground, they vsed to go vnto a certain hil whiche
was appointed for such deuotion, and there sacrifised
two children, a boy, and a girle of thrée yeares of age,
to the honor of <em class="italic">Tlaloc</em> god of water, beséeching him
therefore
deuoutlye, to haue alwayes a care to prouide them
water: these children were frée borne, and therfore theyr
hartes were not taken out of their bodies, but after that
their throtes were cut, their bodies were wrapped in a
new mantel, and then buried in a graue of stone.</p>

<p>The feaste of <em class="italic">Tozoztli</em> was, when the fields of <em class="italic">Maiz</em>
were growen two foote high, then a certaine summe of
merchandise was gathered among the dwellers in the
towne, wherewith were bought foure little slaues betwixt
the age of fiue and seuen, and they were likewise
sacrificed to the god <em class="italic">Tlaloc</em>, for continuall shoures of
rayne. And those dead bodies were shut vp in a caue appointed
for the same purpose. The beginning of this sacrifice
of foure children was, at the time when in foure
yeres space it rayned not, in the whiche season y<sup>e</sup> springs
were dryed vp, and al gréene things perished: wherfore
they were forced to leaue the countrey, and went to inhabite
at <em class="italic">Nicaragua</em>. In the moneth and feast of <em class="italic">Hueitozotli</em>,
when the corne fields of <em class="italic">Maiz</em> waxed ripe, then
euery one in generall gathered his handful of <em class="italic">Maiz</em>, and
brought it vnto the temple for an offering, with a certaine
drinke called <em class="italic">Atuli</em>, whiche is made of the same
<em class="italic">Maiz</em>. They brought also the swéete gum <em class="italic">Copalli</em> to sense
the gods which do cause the corne to growe: and all that
night they ceassed not dauncing without drunkennesse.
At the beginning of summer they celebrate an other
feast called <em class="italic">Tlaxuchimcaco</em>, with all kinde of Roses and
swéete floures that might be gotten, and thereof they vsed
to make garlands to set vpon the Idols heades, and
so spente all that day in dauncing. And to celebrate the
feast called <em class="italic">Tecuilhuitli</em>, al the gentlemen, and principall
persons of ech prouince, do come vnto the Citie, on the
euening of the feast, and then they apparell a woman
with the attire of the Gods of salt, who daunced among
a great company of hir neighboures. But on the nexte
day she was sacrificed with all the Ceremonies and solemnitie
accustomed, and al that day was spent in gret
deuotion, burning of incense in the fire pannes of the
temple.</p>

<p>The merchants who had a temple by themselues dedicated
to the god of gaines, made their feast vppon the
day called <em class="italic">Miccailhuitl</em>, wherein they slewe many slaues
in sacrifice, which they had bought, and banqueted that
feast with mans flesh, dauncing al the day. The feast of
<em class="italic">Vchpaniztli</em> they sacrificed a woman, and afterward hyr
bodye was slayne, and hir skinne put vppon an <em class="italic">Indians</em>
backe, who daunced two days a row with al the townsmen,
which were apparelled in their best attire to celebrate
y<sup>e</sup> feaste. The day of <em class="italic">Hatamutztli</em> y<sup>e</sup> feast is kept in
<em class="italic">Mexico</em>, where they enter into y<sup>e</sup> lake w<sup>t</sup> a great nūber of
<em class="italic">Canoas</em>, &#38; there they drown a boy &#38; a girle in a litle boat,
which they cause to be sonke, in such sorte, that neuer
after that boat appeareth again: and they hold opinion y<sup>t</sup>
those children were in company with the Goddes of the
lake. So that, that daye was spente in feasting in the
temples, and annoynting the Idols chéekes, with gum
called <em class="italic">Vlli</em>. There were some Images that had their
faces two ynches thicke with that gum.</p>

On the backe side of euerye greate
Temple, in euerye Cittie was
made a greate Hall or lodgyng,
standing alone, where as manye
women did eate, drincke, lodge,
&#38; leade their liues. And although
suche houses had no orders, they
aboad there sure ynough. These
women which lay in the houses of the Goddes, were of
sundry intentions. But none of them came to abide
there al their life time, although among them wer some
olde women. Some entered into those religious houses
being sicke and disseased, hoping there to recouer theyr
health: others came thither through pure néede, and necessitie,
to be there relieued: other some came thither to
be good and vertuous: and some entered into the religion,
hoping that the Goddes woulde giue vnto them
riches, and long life. But generallye their comming
thyther was, to haue good husbandes, and manye chyldren:
eche of them vowed the time that shee woulde or
ment to abide in that order, and after that time expired
they marryed.</p>

<p>The first thing that they did comming into the religion,
was to polle their heads, to be knowen frō others.
Their offices were to spinne cotton wool and feathers,
and to weaue cloth, for to apparel the Goddes and themselues,
to swepe the yarde and lodgings of the temple (for
the stayres and high chappels, the ministers themselues
did make cleane) they vsed also to let them bloud in certaine
partes of the body, to offer to the Diuellish Idols.
On euery festiual day they went on procession with the
priestes, but it was not lawful for them to presume to go
vppe the stayres of the temple, nor yet to sing. They liued
on almes, for their kinsefolke being rich, did mayntaine
them with almes as a charitable seruice done vnto
the Goddes: their foode was boyled flesh, and hote bread,
to the intent that they should offer therof to the Goddes,
that they might tast of the smoke of that victual: they vsed
to eate in communitie, and lay altogither in one dormitorye,
as a flocke of shéepe: they lay alwayes in theyr
clothes, for honestie sake, and also to be the sooner ready
in the morning to serue the Gods, &#38; to go to their worke.
And yet I know not why they shold put off their clothes,
for they went almost naked. On the holy dayes they vsed
to daunce before the Gods, and she that either talked or
laughed with any religious or secular person, was reprehended
for the same. And if any of them committed
whoredome, then both the man &#38; the woman were slain,
yea they belieued that all suche offenders fleshe woulde
rotte and consume away, and especially those which had
lost their Virginity in the time of their religion. So that
with feare of punishmente and infamie, they were good
women al the while that they aboade there.</p>

The Diuell did many times talke wyth
the priestes, and with other rulers and
perticular persons, but not with al sorts
of men. And vnto him to whom the
Diuel had appeared, was offered &#38; presented
great giftes. The wicked spirit
appeared vnto thē in a thousand shapes, and fashions, &#38;
finally he was conuersant and familiar among them
very often. And the fooles thought it a greate wonder,
that Gods would be so familiar with mortal men. Yea
they not knowing that they were Diuels, and hearing
of them many things before the had hapned, gaue great
credite and beliefe to their illusions and deceites. And
bycause he commaunded them, they sacrificed suche an
infinite number of creatures. Likewise he, vnto whom
he had apeared, carried about him painted, the likenesse
wherin he shewed himself the first time. And they painted
his image vpon their dores, benches, and euery corner
of the house. And as he appeared in sundry figures
&#38; shapes, euen so they painted him, of infinite fashions,
yea and some foule, grieslye, &#38; feareful to beholde, but
yet vnto them, it semed a thing delectable. So this ignorant
people giuing credite to y<sup>e</sup> condēned spirite, were
growen euen to y<sup>e</sup> highest hil of crueltie, vnder the coulour
of deuout &#38; religious persons, yea they had suche a
custome, that before they would eat or drink, they wold
take therof a little quantitie, &#38; offer it vnto the sun and
to the earth. And if they gathered corne, fruite, or roses,
they would take a leafe before they would smel it, &#38; offer
the same. And he that did not obserue these &#38; such other
ceremonies, was iudged one y<sup>t</sup> had not god in his
hart, yea &#38; (as they say) a man out of the gods fauour.</p>

The greatnesse of the newe
Spayne, the Maiestie of <em class="italic">Mexico</em>,
and the qualitie of the cōquerers,
required a man of noble
bloude to gouerne, wherevpon
the Emperour sente thither
<em class="italic">Don Antonio de Mendosa</em>,
brother vnto the Marques <em class="italic">de
Moniar</em>, for viceroy, at whose ariual
there returned from thence <em class="italic">Sebastian Camires</em>, who
had gouerned that countrey with great discretion and
worthy commendation. In recompēce wherof the Emperour
made him president of the chancery of <em class="italic">Valladolid</em>,
and bishop of <em class="italic">Culuca</em>. <em class="italic">Don Antonio de Mendosa</em> was appointed
viceroy in the yeare .1534. who carried with him
many artificers verye experte in their sciences, likewise
through his intercession, a money house was erected in
<em class="italic">Mexico</em>: he also caused silke to be made and wrought in
that countrey, and planted many Mulbery trées for the
same, although the <em class="italic">Indians</em> little care for suche things
through their slouthfulnesse and gret liberty. This viceroy
<em class="italic">Don Antonio</em>, called all the Bishoppes, cleargy, and
learned men togither, to consult vpō ecclesiastical matters,
which tended to the doctrine of the <em class="italic">Indians</em>. At that
instant was decreed, that the <em class="italic">Indians</em> shoulde be instructed
only in the latin tong, which they learned verye wel
and also the Spanishe tong. They learne the Musicke
with good wil, especially the flaute: their voyces are not
good for the pricke song. At that season was also decréed,
that no <em class="italic">Indian</em> should take order of Priesthood.
The viceroy <em class="italic">Don Antonio</em> built certaine townes with
Romaine pillers, in honor of the Emperour, and caused
his name to be grauen in Marble. He also began the
Kay or wharfe in the porte of <em class="italic">Medellin</em>, a costly and necessarie
worke: he also reduced the <em class="italic">Chichimecas</em> to ciuel liuing:
he spente muche money in the entraunce of <em class="italic">Sibola</em>,
without any profit, and also thereby remayned an enemy
to <em class="italic">Cortes</em>. He likewise discouered much land on the south
coast near <em class="italic">Xalixco</em>: he sente also shippes to <em class="italic">Molluca</em>, for
spices, which were lost: he behaued himself very prudētly
in the rebellion time of the <em class="italic">Indians</em> of <em class="italic">Piru</em>.</p>

<p>The Emperour commaunded him afterwarde to goe
vnto the <em class="italic">Piru</em> for viceroy, considering the licenciat <em class="italic">Gasca</em>,
who gouerned there, was returned into Spain, and likewise
hauing vnderstood his good gouernement in the new
Spaine, although some complaintes were made of hym.
It grieued <em class="italic">Don Antonio de Mendosa</em>, to departe from the
newe Spaine, where he founde himselfe wel beloued among
the <em class="italic">Indians</em>, who had cured him of sundry disseases
with bathes of Hearbes, where before he was starke
lame, and also possessed of lands, Cattel, and other riche
things, whiche he was loth to leaue. Likewise he desired
not to haue to deale with other newe men, whose conditions
he knewe not, although he knewe that the <em class="italic">Piruleros</em>
were stubborne and vnruely felowes. But of necessitie
he was compelled to take that iourney by lande from
<em class="italic">Mexico</em> to <em class="italic">Panama</em>, which standeth fiue hundred leagues
distant, in the yeare a 1851. And that yere came <em class="italic">Don Luys
de Valasco</em> for viceroie to <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, who was a Gentleman
wise and discrete in his gouernement. The office of viceroy
in the newe Spaine, is a charge of great honor and
profite.</p>

Oh how greately are those <em class="italic">Indians</em> bound to
prayse God, who being seruants of Satan,
and lost Shéepe, yet it pleased the goodnesse
of the Almighty to haue compassion of thē,
who hath giuen them light to come out of
darkenesse, and brought them to the knowledge of theyr
cruell and abhominable life, and hath nowe giuen vnto
them the holy Ghost in baptisme: oh most happie <em class="italic">Cortes</em>,
thy paynes was well employed, oh valiant Conquerors,
your names shall liue for euer. I am now bolde to saye,
that all the lande which is conquered in the new <em class="italic">Spaine</em>,
the people thereof are generally conuerted vnto the faith
of Iesus Chryste: oh what a greate felicitie is it vnto
those blessed Kyngs who were the beginners thereof.</p>

<p>Some doe saye, that in the newe Spayne onely are
conuerted Christians sixe Millions. Others hold opinion
of eyghte Millions. And othersome doe assuredly affirme,
that aboue tenne Millions are Christened. But in
conclusion, I am assured, that within the limittes of four
hundred leagues, there are none vnchristened.</p>

<p>The conuersion began with the Conquest, but wyth
the diligence in prosecuting the warres, little good was
done, vntyll the yeare 1524. and then the matter
wente forwarde effectuallye, by reason that certayne
learned menne wente thyther for the same purpose.</p>

<p>At the begynnyng it was a troublesome thyng to
teach them, for wante of vnderstandyng the one of the other,
wherefore they procured to teache the chyldren of
Gentlemen whiche were most aptest, the Spanishe tong,
and they likewise learned the <em class="italic">Mexican</em> spéeche, in the
whiche language they dayly preached. It was at the
firste a paynefull thing to make them leaue those Idols
in whome they hadde euer beléeued, yea and the Diuell
gaue them cruell warres in spirite, and manye times, in
appearing in diuers formes vnto them, threatning, that
if they dyd call vpon the name of Iesus Christ, it should
not rayne, and that all their delight and pleasure shoulde
be taken from them, prouoking them still to Rebellion
against the Christians, but his wicked counsell woulde
not preuayle.</p>

<p>Through greate punishmente they haue left off the
horrible sinne of Sodomy, although it was a greate griefe
to put away their number of wiues.</p>

<p>There are nowe in the newe Spayne eyght Byshoprikes,
whereof one is an Archbishoprike.</p>

There was a greate contention betwéene
<em class="italic">Hernando Cortes</em>, and <em class="italic">Don Antonio de Mendosa</em>,
the Vizeroy, as concerning the prouince
of <em class="italic">Sibola</em>, for each of them pretended
a title vnto the same through the Emperoures
gift, the one by meanes of his office
of Vizeroy, and the other by his office of Captayne
Generall, vpon the whyche matter they grewe into such
hatred, that perfyte friendshippe coulde neuer after take
place betwéene them, although at the beginning they
were familiar and louing friendes: but malice grewe to
such extremitie, that eache of them wrote vndecently
agaynste other, to the Emperoure theyr maister,
the whyche theyr doyngs blemished both theyr credites.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortes</em> wente to lawe with the Licenciat <em class="italic">Villa Lobos</em> the
Kings Attourney, aboute certayne of his vassals, and
also the Vizeroy assisted agaynste him as muche as hée
myghte. Vpon consideration whereof, he was enforced
to come into Spayne in Anno 1540. and broughte <em class="italic">Don
Martin</em> his sonne and heyre, béeyng a childe of eyghte
yeares of age, and hys sonne <em class="italic">Don Luys</em>, to serue the
Prince: he came very riche, but not so riche as the fyrste
time. He entred into great friendship with the Cardinal
<em class="italic">Loaisa</em>, and the Secretarie <em class="italic">Cobos</em>, but it preuayled not, for
the Emperoure was gone into Flanders about matters
of Gant.</p>

<p>In the yeare 1541. the Emperoure personally wente
to the séege of Argell with a mightie armye, and <em class="italic">Cortez</em>
with his two sonnes went also thither to serue him with
a good companye of men and Horses, but it pleased God
to raise vp suche a tempest, wherewith the most parte of
the fléete perished. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> then being in the Galley of
<em class="italic">Don Henrike Enrikes</em>, called the <em class="italic">Esperanca</em>, and fearing to
lose his rich emraldes and other Iewels at the time that
the Galley was driuen by violence of weather vpon the
shore, he then bound about him the sayde fyue rich emraldes,
estéemed in a hundred thousande Duckates, yet
notwithstanding through the throng of people, and hast
to escape out of oese and mire, the Iewels fell from him,
who could neuer heare more of them, so that the present
warres cost hym more than any other, except the Emperoures
maiestie, although <em class="italic">Andrea de Oria</em> lost eleuen
Galleys.</p>

<p>But the losse of treasure gréeued hym not so much, as
the excluding hym out of the Counsell of the warres,
whereas other yong Gentlemen of lesse knowledge
and abilitie were accepted, which was a cause of greate
murmuryng among the host. And where in the counsell
of warre it was determined to leaue the séege and to depart,
it gréeued manye, whereupon <em class="italic">Cortes</em> made an open
offer, that he alone with the Spanishe nation would presume
to take <em class="italic">Argell</em>, hauyng but the one halfe of the <em class="italic">Tudescos</em>
and <em class="italic">Italians</em>, if it woulde please the Emperoure
to graunte vnto hym the enterprise. The Souldyers
on the lande dyd hyghly commende hys courage, but the
Sea menne woulde giue no eare vnto him, so that it is
thoughte that the offer came not to the Emperoures
knowledge. <em class="italic">Cortes</em> wente vp and downe in the Courte a
long season, being sore afflicted in a certaine sute aboute
hys vassals, and also the processe and allegations of <em class="italic">Nunio
de Guzman</em>, layde vnto hys charge in hys residence.
The whole processe was séene in the counsell of <em class="italic">Indias</em>,
but iudgemente was neuer pronounced, whyche was
a greate hartes ease for <em class="italic">Cortes</em>. And then hée departed
from the Courte towarde Siuill, with determinate
wyll to passe vnto the newe Spayne, and to ende his
lyfe in <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and also to receyue the Lady Mary, <em class="italic">Cortes</em>
hys daughter, who was come from <em class="italic">India</em>, and promised
in marriage vnto <em class="italic">Don Aluar Perez Osorio</em>, with a hundred
thousande Duckates in dowry, and hyr apparell, but
the marriage tooke no effecte, through the faulte of <em class="italic">Don
Aluar</em> and hys father.</p>

<p>He then fell sicke of a flixe and indisgestion, whiche
endured long, so that on hys iourney towarde the Citie
of Siuill, he departed thys transitory lyfe, in a little
Village called <em class="italic">Castilleia de La Cuesta</em>, whyche standeth
a myle from the Citie of Siuill, on the seconde of December
Anno 1547. béeyng thréescore and thrée yeares
of age.</p>

<p>His body was deposited w<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> dukes of <em class="italic">Medina Sidonia</em>.</p>

<p>He left a Sonne and thrée Daughters begotten of the
Lady <em class="italic">Iane de Zuniga</em> his wife, his Sonne was called <em class="italic">Don
Martin Cortes</em>, who did inherite his fathers estate, and was
married vnto the Lady <em class="italic">Ana de Arellano</em>, his cousine,
daughter to the Countie <em class="italic">De Aguilar</em>, by order of his father.</p>

<p>The doughters vnto <em class="italic">Cortes</em> were named as foloweth,
the lady <em class="italic">Donea Maria</em>, <em class="italic">Donea Catalina</em>, and <em class="italic">Donea Iuana</em> who
was the yongest. He had another Sonne by an <em class="italic">Indian</em>
woman, and he was called <em class="italic">Don Martin Cortez</em>. He had also
another base sonne by a Spanish woman, who was named
<em class="italic">Don Luys Cortez</em>, and thrée daughters by thrée seuerall
<em class="italic">Indian</em> women.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cortez</em> buylt an hospitall in <em class="italic">Mexico</em>, and gaue order for

in <em class="italic">Coioacan</em>, where he willed in his Testament that his
bones shoulde be buried at the charges of his Sonne and

whiche yéeldeth yéerely his houses in <em class="italic">Mexico</em>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To

particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
