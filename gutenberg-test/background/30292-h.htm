INTRODUCTION
</h2>

<p>
The object of this book will be throughout its entirety to teach
in a practical manner the art of Fly Tying in all its branches. The
principles used herein, and the methods of construction employed,
are those used by the professional fly-tier who practices
fly-making for the sake of art, and tries to achieve with each
finished fly, a masterpiece.
</p>

<p>
None of the short-cuts employed by those whose business is
quantity production will be attempted. Only the making of flies of
the very highest quality and most durable construction will be
attempted. In describing the principals of construction with the
following illustrations, it will be impossible to describe in
detail each standard pattern; however, it must be remembered that
the fundamentals applying to each style of fly will be the
principal bases of construction of all flies of that style, and
that the use of different body materials, hackles, wings or size
will simply change the pattern and not the fundamental points of
construction.
</p>

<p>
Dressings for hundreds of standard patterns will be found fully
described elsewhere in this book. For clearness {viii} of
understanding please note that where a fly is described in this
book as having grey wings, or red body, etc., and no particular
feather or material is specified, it means that any feather or body
material may be used. When a particular feather, body, hackle,
tail, etc., must be used it will be so stated.
</p>

<p>
Each year a steadily increasing number of anglers are learning
to tie their own flies. Not many years ago, there were few in
America outside of professional tiers who understood the art. Now
on each angling trip, at least one is sure to be met, who has
discovered the great thrill of taking fish on flies of his own
tying.
</p>

<p>
To those who are anticipating the making of their own flies for
the first time, there is the opportunity to exercise one's
ingenuity in the creation of new patterns. To prolong your fishing
seasons throughout the long winter evenings, in the confines of
your own den, where, with a supply of fur, feathers and tinsel, can
be enjoyed a profitable, artistic and pleasant hobby. And the
thrill of seeing in each finished imitation of Ephemeridae,
Muscidae and Formicidae, a masterpiece to bring the joy of living
and dreams of spring to the angler's heart.
</p>

<p>
Beginners are requested to reject any inclination to skip over
the first part of this book, nor to attempt the tying of the more
delicate and difficult dry flies before they have had sufficient
preliminary training. {ix} This book is so written that the easier
flies to make are the first encountered. Although you may not
expect to use Bucktail Streamers, the fundamental principles
employed in their construction, the knack of handling fur, feathers
and tinsel, will be acquired, and a sense of proportion will be
realized. I sincerely encourage you to begin at the beginning, and
by careful and patient study the satisfactory result will be the
ability to make flies that are second to none.
</p>

<p>
The illustrations in this book are all drawn to correct
proportions except the tying silk, which is purposely drawn large
for clearness of illustration. Follow these illustrations, and
begin by making a very careful study of Diagram 3, "Bucktails"
(page 15). Here will be learned how to overcome some of the
difficulties encountered by beginners. Many of the fundamentals
learned in tying Bucktails are used in tying all of the flies to
follow. For instance, in putting the wings or tail on a wet fly,
the same method of holding the wing between the thumb and finger
and making the loose loop, are explained as when putting the hair
or tail on a Bucktail. Putting the wings on a fly correctly seems
to be the greatest difficulty encountered by the beginner.
Consequently, the necessity of carefully studying Figs. 4, 5, 10,
and 11 of Diagram 3 cannot be too greatly emphasized. Before tying
any other part of the fly, place a bare hook in the vise, and
practice tying on the tail, {x} and then the wings, until you have
mastered this knack, and have the wings and tail setting straight
on top of the hook, as in Figs. 4, 5, 10 and 11 of Diagram 3. First
using hair and then a section of feather.
</p>

<p>
Other faults of the beginner where literal descriptions are
followed entirely or where illustrations are not drawn to correct
proportions or followed closely are as follows. The wings are
usually too large, and much too long for the size of the hook, and
the tail is most always too long, as are the hackles. The bodies
seldom have a nicely tapered shape, and most always start too far
back on the hook shank. The ribbing is seldom put on in even tight
spirals. The hair on hair flies is always too long, and too much is
used. The head is too large, because the tying silk is not wound
tightly and smoothly. The eye of the hook on the finished fly is
filled with hair, tying silk, hackles and cement.
</p>

<p>
I do not mean to criticize these common mistakes of the
beginner. Instead, I merely wish to call them to your mind, and
assure you that they are not necessary, and will not happen if you
will diligently follow instructions in this book.</p>

TOOLS, HOOKS AND<br>
MATERIALS
</h2>

<p>
Very few tools are required by the Fly-Tier. Those that are
necessary are inexpensive, and most of them can be homemade.
However, as with any other craft good tools are an asset. I advise
the beginner to procure the following:
</p>

<h3 align="center">TOOLS
</h3>

<p>
<i>Fly-Tiers' vise.</i> There are many styles of fly-tying vises
on the market. The simplest is just a slot cut in a 3/8" piece of
square steel with a hacksaw, and a thumb screw to tighten the slot.
This type of vise will work all right, although rather clumsy and
hard to tighten enough to hold the hook truly. Another simple vise
is just a small pin chuck, soldered to one end of a 1/4" brass rod,
bent at the desired angle, and the other end of the rod soldered to
a small C clamp. However, I prefer a vise of the cam lever type.
That is, a vise that has a cam lever for opening and closing the
jaws. These vises, of which there are several makes, are {2}
adjustable to various angles and hook sizes. They will hold all
sizes of hooks very firmly, and are easily and quickly opened with
a flip of the lever.
</p>

<p>
<i>Hackle Pliers.</i> These can be purchased for about fifty
cents and will prove a worthwhile investment, as they are rather
difficult to make satisfactorily.
</p>

<p>
<i>Scissors.</i> One pair with curved blades and sharp points
for small flies and one pair with small straight blades. A needle
pushed into a stick, for picking out hackles that are wound under,
and for putting lacquer on the finished head, completes the list of
necessary tools.
</p>

<h3 align="center">HOOKS
</h3>

<p>
Hooks used for fly-tying differ somewhat from those used for
bait fishing etc., inasmuch as they are usually hollow ground, and
tapered shank especially those used for dry flies. The tapered
shank next to the eye allows the head of the fly to be tied
smaller, and also reduces the weight of the hook, an advantage for
dry flies. Of course flies may be tied on any style or grade of
hook, but considering the work involved in making the fly, and
realizing that with an old razor blade the fly can be quickly
removed from the hook should the first attempts prove
unsatisfactory, you will see the advantage in using good hooks.

MATERIALS
</h3>

<a name="materials" id="materials">
</a>

<p align="left">

</p>

<p>
Materials used by the Fly-Tier cover an extremely large field.
Although only a few simple and easily obtained items are necessary
for a start, it is interesting to know that furs, feathers and body
materials come from all parts of the world. There's the jungle cock
from India whose neck feathers are extensively used on salmon flies
and a very large percentage of all fancy flies. The golden pheasant
from China, the bustard from Africa, the Mandarin wood duck from
China, the capercailzie from Ireland, the game cocks from Spain and
the Orient, the teal, mallard, grouse, ibis, swan, turkey, and
hundreds of others. The polar bear, Impala, North and South
American deer, seal, black bear, skunk, rabbit, squirrel, are a few
of the hairs that are used. The beginner need not worry about the
great variety. Some hooks, silk floss and spun fur or wool yarn and
chenille for bodies, a few sizes of tinsel for ribbing, bucktails
of three or four colors, an assortment of duck and turkey wing
quills some mallard breast, an assortment of neck and saddle
hackles, a spool of tying silk, a piece of wax, a bottle of head
lacquer, and many of the popular patterns can be made. Numerous
other items can be added from time to time, and the novice Fly-Tier
will soon find himself in possession of a collection of fuzzy furs
and feathers that will delight the heart of any professional,
and from which any conceivable lure can be made to attract the
denizens of the shady pools.

</p>

<p>
BODY MATERIAL: Tinsel, Silk Floss, Fur, Chenille, Wool, Quill
and Cork are used for bodies. The most commonly used for Bucktail
Streamers is flat tinsel ribbed with oval tinsel or no ribbing at
all. About the easiest body to make is one of chenille ribbed with
tinsel. Silk floss is mostly used for wet and dry fly bodies. The
domestic silk floss, which is called rope, can be successfully used
for the larger flies, by untwisting and using a few of the smaller
strands. An imported floss of one single strand, with a very slight
twist, is especially made for fly-tying; this will work much better
on the smaller hooks. Fur for fur bodies, which formerly had to be
plucked from the hide, dyed the desired color, and spun on the
waxed tying silk, can now be obtained in all standard fly colors.
It is called Spun Fur, and is very convenient to use in this
manner.
</p>

<p>
QUILL BODIES: Quill makes an excellent and very lifelike body,
especially on dry flies. The quill from the eyed peacock tail
feather is mostly used. That taken from the eye of the feather when
stripped of its fibers has a two tone effect, and when wound upon
the hook without overlapping makes a very lifelike and delicate
appearing body.

<br><br><br>

<p align="left">
{8}
</p>

<p>
HERL BODIES: Both peacock and ostrich herl is used for bodies.
These make a fuzzy body. Tie in one or two strands by the tip end
and wind on edgewise.
</p>

<p>
HACKLES: These are the most important part of the dry fly. Only
those from the neck of a mature cock are satisfactory. Hackles for
the dry fly must be stiff with very little or no web. With such
hackles a dry fly can be sparsely dressed as it should be and still
maintain its natural balance and floating qualities. On the other
hand, a wet fly should sink readily, and should be made with very
soft webby hackles. These absorb water quickly, and have better
action in the water. Contrary to the customary way to tie hackles
on the wet fly, as explained in the chapter "Wet Flies", I find it
very convenient and economical to strip the fibers from any size
hackle, clip off the butt ends to the desired length and tie them
on the bottom of the hook, the same as buck tail is tied on. As wet
flies should have hackles only on the bottom or underneath side,
many hackles that are otherwise too large can be used in this
way.

</p>

<p>
TAILS: A few fibers from a golden or silver pheasant neck
tippet, whisks from a hackle feather, a strip of wing or breast
feather, a few hairs, etc., are used for tails. Many of the
standard patterns are tied without tails; however, on all of my dry
flies, I tie three or four stiff fibers or hairs. They balance the
fly and help it to float much better.

<p align="left">
{10}
</p>

<p>
CHEEKS OR SHOULDERS: As per Fig. 9, Diagram 1, these are used on
a great many of the fancy flies. These are straps of one or several
feathers of contrasting colors. Jungle cock feathers, golden
pheasant tippets, silver pheasant body feathers, as on the Grey
Ghost streamer fly, blue chatterer, and many other fancy feathers
according to pattern and fancy are used for this purpose. A pair of
jungle cock tippets often called eyes, added to a Bucktail Streamer
will often take trout, when the same pattern without the jungle
cock will not.
</p>

<p>
RIBBING: Tinsel, Wool, Silk, Horse Hair, Quill, etc., are used
for ribbing. The tinsel from your Xmas tree will do, but it is much
better to use tinsel made for the purpose, as it will not tarnish
so quickly and is much stronger. It is advisable before using
tinsel to place a drop of good, clear head lacquer between the
thumb and finger and draw the tinsel through it. This makes it
tarnish-proof, and is particularly advisable with the oval and
round tinsel that is wound over a silk core. Besides
tarnish-proofing it, it will keep the tinsel from coming apart.
Tinsel bodies should be lacquered after they are finished.

</center>

<br><br><br>

<p>
WINGS: Several styles of wings are used, see Diagram 2, page xi,
those on Fig. 1, and are cut from a pair of matched wing quill
feathers, like Fig. 7. Those in Fig. 2 are buzz wings taken from a
pair of breast feathers {12} (mallard, wood duck, etc.) shown in
Fig. 8. Fig. 3 shows hackle tip wings, tips of two hackle feathers,
see Fig. 9. Fan wings, Fig. 4, are a matched pair of small breast
feathers, see Fig. 10 (white duck, mallard, teal, grouse, etc.). In
fact there is hardly a bird that flies that does not supply some of
its plumage to the Fly-Tier. Flies of the order Diptera (land
flies), such as the Bee, Cowdung, Blue Bottle, etc., should be tied
with flat wings as in Fig. 5. A Bi-visible is shown in Fig. 6. This
is a fly without wings, hackle tied palmer (that is hackle wound
the full length of the hook, usually tied without a body, and the
dark patterns have a turn or two of white hackle in front).</p>
<p>All of the flies on Diagram 2 are shown as dry flies; however,
the same feathers are used for wet flies, streamers, etc., the
difference being the style in which they are tied, which is
explained elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
WAX: Use a good grade of wax for fly-tying. The proper wax will
work much better than shoemaker's wax or beeswax. Wax for fly-tying
should be quite sticky so that when the waxed tying silk is let go
of, it will not unwind while tying the fly.

</p>

<p>
TYING SILK: Ordinary sewing silk is too coarse for ordinary
fly-tying and it doesn't seem to have the strength. Size 00 is a
good size for all flies including bucktails and streamers. For dry
flies and small wet flies a gossamer silk size 000 and 0000 is the
best to use. Although the strength of this fine silk is much less
than the size 00, it has the advantage that more turns can be used,
and the heads can be made much smaller.

Place a hook in the vise and start waxed tying silk (See Diagram
3, page 15) (A) 1/8" from eye of hook Fig. 1. Take five or six
turns and cut off end (B) Fig. 2. Wind tying silk (A) closely and
smoothly down hook shank as Fig 3. (A complete understanding of the
next step will have a great deal to do with the success of the
beginner's greatest difficulty, that is, putting on the wings; the
procedure is the same for all flies, study Fig. 4.) Hold tail
material (C) between thumb and finger of the left hand, slide the
fingers down over the hook, so that the tail material rests on top
of the hook, with the hook held firmly between thumb and finger as
Fig. 4. Now loosen grip just enough to allow tying silk (A) to pass
up between thumb and tail material, form a loose loop over
material, and down, between finger and material on the other side.
Now tighten grip with thumb and finger and pull loop down tight;
repeat once more, see Fig. 5. (This knack of holding the material
and hook firmly together, until the loose loop is drawn down
tightly keeps the tail, or wings, on top of the {17} hook, and at
the same time keeps them from splitting or turning sidewise.) Now
that the tail is in place, with two turns of the tying silk (A) tie
in ribbing (D) Fig. 6. Now take six or eight close tight turns with
the tying silk towards the eye of the hook, with two more turns tie
in the body material (E) Fig. 7. IF USING TINSEL FOR BODY MATERIAL,
BE SURE AND CUT THE END TO A TAPER BEFORE TYING IN as (E) Fig. 7;
this tends to make a smoother body and prevents a bunch where the
body material is tied in. Next wind tying silk (A) back to the
starting point, take a half hitch and let it hang. Now wind body
material (E) clockwise (all windings are clockwise) tightly and
smoothly back towards the barb, to the extreme rear end of the
body, pull tight and wind forward to within 1/8" of the eye, wind
back and forth to form smooth tapered body as Fig. 8 (tinsel bodies
are not tapered). (If using silk floss, untwist the floss and use
only one half or one third of the strands, do not let it twist,
wind tight, and it will make a nice smooth body.) Take two turns
and a half hatch with the tying silk, and cut off end of the
material (F) Fig. 8. Take one tight turn with ribbing (D) over
butt of tail close to rear end of the body, also one turn under the
tail if tail is to be cocked. Wind ribbing spirally around the body
and tie off with two turns and a half hitch of tying silk as Fig.
9.

Take about three dozen hairs of colored bucktail, cut off butt
ends to the length wanted for the finished fly, not more than one
half again as long as the hook, place these on top of the hook as
Fig. 10 with butt ends about 1/16" back of the eye (this is held
the same as when putting on the tail, Fig. 4). Pull down two or
three loops, Fig. 11. Now take about 175 hairs of other colored
bucktail, place this on top of the first colored bucktail the same
as Fig. 10. Repeat the same operation as Fig. 11. Before finishing
the head put a drop of head lacquer on the butt ends of the hairs
to cement them in place, finish by making a smooth tapered head
with the tying silk, take three or four half hitches, paint the
head with two or three coats of lacquer and the job is complete,
unless you wish to add jungle cock cheeks, or other combinations of
feathers. This of course is done before the head is completed.

Start the waxed tying silk (See Diagram 4, page 21) 1/8" from
eye of hook, Fig. 1. Wind tying silk (A) down shank of hook, and
with last two turns tie in tag material (B) Fig. 2. Tags (see
diagram 1) usually represent the egg sac on the female of the
species. Chenille, wool, gold, silver, silk, herl, or various other
materials are used for tags. (Ribbing, if used, is tied in just
before the tag material.) Tie in tail (C) Fig. 3 (see Fig. 4
Bucktail, Diagram 3, page 15, for directions, how to hold the tail.
Take from one to four turns with the Tag Material (B) around the
hook, take a couple of turns with tying silk (A) around the loose
end of (B) and cut off (B) as Fig. 4. Take about three or four
turns towards the eye of the hook with (A), with two more turns tie
in the body material (D) Fig. 4. Wind (A) back to the starting
point, take a half hitch and let hang. Wind body material (D) to
where (A) was left hanging. Wind (D) back and forth several times
to form a tapered body, fasten with two or three turns and a half
hitch with (A) Fig. 5. Next take hackle (E), and strip off soft web
fibers on dotted line, Fig. E. Hold hackle {23} (E) by the tip with
thumb and finger of the left hand, with the shiny side of the
hackle to the right, place the butt diagonally under the hook and
take four or five tight turns and a half hitch with (A) Fig. 6. Be
sure that the hackle is tied on edgewise with the shiny side to the
front. Now grasp the tip of the hackle with the hackle pliers and
wind four or five turns clockwise around the hook. If the hackle
starts winding edgewise it will go on without any trouble, if not
better take it off and try again until you get the knack of tying
the butt in at just the right angle. Take three or four turns over
the hackle tip with (A) and clip off the tip close as Fig. 7. With
the thumb and finger of the left hand, reach from under the hook
and pull all the fibers down to the bottom, take three or four
turns over them with (A) towards the barb of the hook, to hold them
in place, and to keep them pointing well back, as Fig. 8. Next take
a pair of matched (one right and one left) turkey, goose, or other
wing feathers, Fig. A, and cut a section from each about 1/4" wide,
place the two sections with tips even and concave sides together as
Fig. B. Cut off the butt ends to the right length, that is so that
the tips come even, or a little beyond the bend of the hook. Place
on top of hook as Fig. 9 and tie on the same as previously
explained in tying hair on Bucktails (Diagram 3, page 15, Figs. 4
and 10). Finish off with a smooth tapered head, two or three half
hitches {24} and a couple of coats of good head lacquer, Fig. 10.
Many patterns are tied palmer, that is the hackle is wound the
whole length of the body. Many of the dry flies are tied this way,
especially the Bi-visibles. To tie a palmer hackle, prepare the
hackle by holding the tip of the hackle between the thumb and
finger of the left hand, and with the thumb and finger of the right
hand, stroke the fibers back so that they point towards the butt,
instead of towards the tip, Fig. C, Diagram 4. With the shiny side
of the hackle up, strip off the fibers from the bottom side as Fig.
D. Now tie the hackle in by the tip as Fig. 11. Make the body the
same as before. Wind the hackle spirally around the body and tie
off the butt, Fig. 12. To make the hackle more full near the head,
one or more hackles are tied in at the same time as Figs. 6 and 7,
the palmer hackle is wound to within 1/8" of the eye and the butt
tied in and cut off the same as the tip was cut off Fig. 7.

Cut a section about 1/4" wide from a right and one from a left wing
feather, as Fig. A Diagram 4, page 21 (duck wings are best for dry

From now on the body is made as previously explained, so for the
sake of variation we will tie a band in the centre, the same as a
Royal Coachman. Tie in tail (C) Fig. 8. Tie in two or three strands
of peacock herl (D) Fig. 9 with (A) and wind (A) four or five turns
towards the eye of the hook. Take three or four turns with herl
(D). Tie in two strands of silk floss (E) Fig. 10, take a few more
turns with (A) over the loose ends of (D) towards the eye of the
hook. Wind silk floss (E) over the herl about half way up the hook.
Take a turn or two around silk floss (E) with (A) and cut off end
of (E) as Fig. 11. Carry (A) up to the front of the wings. Finish
body with herl (D) wound tight against the back of the wings. (This
helps to push the wings forward and to hold them in place.) Tie off
herl (D) with (A) Fig. 12. The next step of putting on the hackle
(F) is done the same as Fig. 6, Diagram 4, page 21. But here the
hackle is much more important than on the wet fly. The floating
qualities of a dry fly depend entirely upon stiff neck hackle of
the proper size. (Use Hackle Chart.) Sometimes two hackles are
used, these are laid together, and both butts tied in at the same
time. One hackle of the proper size and stiffness is usually
enough, so we will use one tied in as Fig. 13 and explained in Fig.
6, Diagram 4, page 21. Clip the hackle pliers to the tip of hackle
(F) and wind about two turns edgewise in front of the wings, wind
two turns close {31} in back of the wings. Take two or three more
turns in front of the wings, all the while keeping the hackle
edgewise, with the shiny side towards the eye of the hook. Wind the
hackle close so as not to fill up the eye of the hook and to leave
room for the head. Tie in the tip with a couple of turns of (A)
Fig. 14. The hackle should now be standing straight out from the
hook, with the most of it in front of the wings. Shape a tapered
head with (A). (Head should be about 1/16" long on a size 12 hook.)
Finish with two or three half hitches and a drop of head lacquer,
Fig. 15.
</p>

<p>
Various feathers are used for wings of dry flies, such as breast
feathers from mallard, teal; partridge, grouse, black duck, wood
duck. Hackle tips, starling, duck, turkey, goose, pheasant, wing
feathers, etc.
</p>

<p>
Two whole feathers of the proper size, with the natural curve
are used for fan wings. The tips of two feathers, or a section may
be cut from two matched feathers. All of these wings are tied on in
the same manner as previously explained. See Diagram 2 for flies
tied with different style wings.

NYMPHS AND THEIR CONSTRUCTION
</h2>

 <h2 align="center">
NYMPHS
</h2>

<p>
Nymphs are larvae of all aquatic insects. Together with minnows,
crawfish, etc., they represent about ninety per cent of the trout's
regular diet. Considering this fact, it is obvious that nymphs will
take trout throughout the entire season. It will greatly surprise
the novice to learn of the great amount of underwater insect life
present in any stream. Next time you go fishing, hold your landing
net close to the bottom, in a foot or so of fast water. Reach
upstream and loosen the stones and gravel. Raise your landing net,
and notice the numerous nymphs that have been washed from under the
stones, and have attached themselves to your net. Better still,
make a screen about two feet square, from regular 14 mesh window
screening. Hold this in the water, and have your fishing partner go
upstream, and with a regular garden rake, or some such tool, rake
up the bottom, turning over the stones and gravel. This way you can
capture many nymphs. Put them in glass bottles, take them home, and
make copies of them. When next you {33} go fishing open the first
trout you catch, examine the contents of its stomach, and determine
which of the copies you have made is the proper nymph or fly for
the occasion. To fish with an imitation of the fly or nymph upon
which they are feeding, will result in a heavier creel.</p>
<p>When nymph fishing it is important to use a long, finely tapered
leader. A 4x is about right. Fish in the same waters, and very much
the same way as with a dry fly except that the nymph is allowed to
sink. Fish upstream, or up and across the current. In the ripples.
Around boulders. At the edge of fast water. Let the nymph drift
with the current. Follow it with your rod tip, and be prepared to
set the hook at the least hesitation of the line. Trout will
sometimes take a drifting nymph and eject it, without being felt on
the most delicate rod, so be ever on the alert when nymph fishing.
A nymph fished down stream, and retrieved with slow, short jerks,
will often work very well. When fished in this manner, trout will
strike quite hard, and usually hook themselves.</p>
<p>There are times when trout are rolling on the surface and it
seems impossible to take them on anything. It is then that they are
usually feeding on nymphs, just under the surface. I remember one
such time on the Housatonic River in Connecticut last summer. Just
at dark, I was standing knee deep in very fast water. Trout {34}
were breaking all around me. I knew, they were feeding on nymphs,
and tried in every way to catch them. The water was so fast, it was
impossible to keep the nymph just the right depth below the
surface. I tried every trick that I knew, but could not get a
strike. Finally reaching my hand in my pocket, I discovered several
large buckshot. Removing the nymph from the tip of the leader, I
attached five of these large shots, to the very tip of the leader,
with a piece of 3x gut tippet about four inches long. I connected
the nymph to the leader about sixteen inches from the tip. Within
the next few minutes I took several nice trout, within rod's length
of where I was standing. What actually happened, the lead was so
heavy that it immediately sank straight to the bottom, and my taut
line held the nymph suspended about two inches below the surface.
The short gut between the nymph and the leader allowed the nymph to
quiver much as the natural was doing. All the various common nymphs
can be faithfully copied, by learning to tie the various styles of
those herein illustrated. Simply alter the sizes, and color
combinations, according to those found in the waters where you
fish.
</p>

<p>
Remember nearly all the nymphs have flat bodies, and dark backs.
The bodies may be flattened by thoroughly lacquering them, and when
nearly dried squeezing them flat with an ordinary pair of pliers;
or by {35} cutting a piece of quill the shape of the body from a
turkey or goose wing. Bind this on top of the hook for the
foundation of the body, and build the body over this. When
finished, lacquer the entire body.</p>
<p>Most any body materials that are used for the making of other
flies can be used; however, wool is mostly used for nymphs. Silk
floss wound over a quill foundation and then lacquered, makes a
very smooth, realistic body.

THEIR CONSTRUCTION (SEE DIAGRAM 6)
</h3>

<p>
Start tying silk (A) an eighth of an inch from the eye of the
hook and wind closely down shank, as previously done with
bucktails, wet flies etc. Next cut a section (B) from a grey goose
wing feather about one eighth inch wide, and tie on top of the hook
as Fig. 1. This is to make the tail and also the back of the nymph.
Bend (B) back and take a turn or two with (A) in front as Fig. 2.
Tie in the ribbing (c) close to (B) Fig. 3. Next tie in body
material (D) close to (C) Fig. 4. Wool yarn makes the best body
material for this style nymph. Now finish the body as for a wet
fly, Fig. 5, then pull (B) tightly over the top, finish off as Fig.
6. This makes a sort of hard shell over the back. Next turn the
hook upside down in the vise, and lay three horse hairs across,
just in back of where the head is to be made, crisscross (A)
between the hairs to spread them and make them look like legs, and
your nymph should look like Fig. 7. Nymphs of this style as well as
Figs. 8, 9, 10, 14 and 15 look more natural if the bodies are
flattened. Fig. 8 is tied nearly the same as Fig. 7, the difference
being that (C) and (D) are both wound over (B) about two-thirds of
the length of the body, then (B) is turned back, the body finished
as before, (B) brought forward loosely to form the humpbacked wing
case, and (B) being cut off as was done with Fig. 6, and instead of
the butt end of (B) being cut off as was done with Fig. 6 it is
split by crisscrossing (A) through it to form small wings as Fig.
8. Fig. 9 is made in the same way except that several strands of
peacock herl is used for the dark back, tail, and feelers.</p>
<p>Fig. 10 is a very effective nymph, the body made entirely of
natural raffia (soaked in water before using), with black hair used
for the tail and feelers The body coated with lacquer as before
mentioned and pressed flat when dry; paint the back with dark brown
or black lacquer.
</p>

<p>
Fig. 11 is made by close wound palmer hackle cut off on dotted
lines. Fig. 12 is a fur body, made by spinning rabbit's fur or
other fur on waxed tying silk and ribbing with gold; the tougher
this nymph looks the more effective it seems to be. Fig. 13, the
Caddis {38} worm can be more naturally reproduced with a common
rubber band than any other way I know. Get a dirty, white, rubber
band about 1/8" wide, taper one end for about 1/2". Lay two horse
hairs lengthwise on top of the hook for the feelers, wind tying
silk over them down the hook, tie in the rubber band by the very
tip of the taper, wind the tying silk back to the starting point,
and be sure that the tying silk is wound smoothly. If not, any
roughness will show through the rubber band. Wind the rubber band
tightly to about 1/4" back of the eye. Wind back down and take one
turn under the horsehair at the tail end, wind up to the head and
tie off with the tying silk. This now makes three thicknesses of
the rubber band. Form a large head with the tying silk, fasten
securely and you have a very realistic Caddis worm. Fig. 14 is tied
about the same as Fig. 7, with a considerable amount of speckled
mallard, and peacock herl used for both the front and back feelers
as well as the legs.
</p>

<p>
Fig. 15. The Damsel Nymph has a body of dark grey wool with a
back of dark brown or black lacquer. Wings, small red-brown wood
duck breast feathers, feelers dark brown hackle, and a large black
head.

THE HELGRAMITE (SEE DIAGRAM 7)
</h3>

<p>
The Helgramite Nymph, larva of the Dobson Fly, is such an
excellent bass and trout food, that the making of this nymph
deserves special mention. As my personal way of making this
particular nymph differs considerably from those previously
explained, I consider it advisable to go into further details
concerning the construction of this pattern.
</p>

<p>
I personally like the winged style. That is, with small
imitation wings and horns, or feelers. This represents the nymph in
its final underwater stage, just before emerging from the water as
the Dobson Fly. I find black skunk tail the most satisfactory
material for the body of this nymph. Either light grey swan sides,
or light grey pigeon breast feathers for the wing and legs.

<p>
First wind the waxed tying silk up the shank of the hook
beginning opposite the barb. Clip the fibers closely from a couple
of hackle feathers. These are to form the horns. Bind these hackle
quills to the top of the hook, so that the tip ends project about 1
1/2" in front of the eye. Take a bunch of black skunk tail about
the size of a match and bind it to the top of the hook, with tip
ends towards the eye of the hook as in Diagram 7, Fig. 1. Next fold
the hair forward and bind down tightly as in Fig. 2. Again fold the
hair back and tie down as in Fig. 3. Then again as in Fig. 4.
Notice that each time the hair is folded back upon itself and tied
down, that it forms a segment of the body, and that each segment
increases in size, until your nymph looks like Fig. 5. At this
stage turn the nymph over and tie a piece of light grey feather
about 1/8" wide across the bottom, separate the fibers with the
tying silk to form the legs. Now cut a small light grey pigeon
feather with the centre quill, as dotted line in Fig. 6. Give this
a coat of clear lacquer: when dry, tie flat, on the back of the
nymph to form the first set of wings, as in Fig. 7. Cut another
feather and treat the same way, tie these slightly forward of the
first set of wings, and you have a Dobson Nymph that is very
lifelike in appearance.

BASS FLIES AND FEATHER STREAMERS
</h2>

<p>
It will appear obvious from a study of Diagram 8, page (43) that
the tying of bass flies and Feather Streamers differs so little
from the tying of wet flies and bucktails that a detailed
description will be unnecessary.</p>
<p>Bass flies are little more than large trout lies, the principal
difference being the feathers that are used for the wings although
the same feathers can be used as for trout flies. It is customary
with commercial tiers to use two whole feathers for the wings, or
the tips of two wings feathers, etc. Place the concave sides
together and tie in the butt ends the same as for a wet fly. Bass
flies to be used as spinner flies, that is, flies to be used with a
spinner in front, should be tied on ring eyed hooks instead of
hooks with turned down or turned up eyes.

<p>
Certain patterns of these flies have for a long time been famous
as salmon flies in northern New England and Canada and the past few
years have seen them steadily growing in popularity with anglers of
Connecticut, especially for Rainbow Trout. The feathers that are
used for wings are saddle hackles, and from four to eight feathers
are used, hackles of the same size are selected, the tip ends
placed even, and the concave sides of those used for the left side
are placed next to the concave sides of those used for the right
side, in other words, both the right and left side of the wing will
be convex, or outside of the feather. Any of the standard pattern
flies can be tied as streamers. Some of the patterns however, are
very elaborate flies; the Supervisor, for instance, has wings of
light blue with shorter feathers of green on each side, with
peacock herl along each wing, polar bear hair, jungle cock
shoulders, a silver body, and a red tag. This fly was developed a
few years ago by Mr. Joseph Stickney, Supervisor of Wardens, State
of Maine, to imitate the smelt, a natural salmon food. The riginal
Supervisor did not have the jungle cock or the peacock heal. Mr.
Stickney suggested the addition of these feathers to me last year,
and I believe that this is now the approved dressing.

FLOATING BUGS AND THEIR CONSTRUCTION
</h2>

<p>
A style of fishing becoming more popular each year is that of
Fly Rod fishing with Floating Bugs. These Bugs represents the large
moth, butterfly, etc., and are constructed of a large variety of
materials. Some have cork bodies. Some have Balsa Wood bodies.
Others all hair bodies. Bodies covered with chenille, and other
materials. One of the easiest to make and I believe one of the most
successful styles, is entirely constructed from the body hair of
the deer, reindeer, or caribou. All of these hairs are rather
coarse and hollow consequently are very buoyant, and when properly
made into a copy of the living insect, they have a soft, lifelike
body that appears very natural when taken by a fish. These soft
bodied Bugs are not so apt to be ejected before the Angler has time
to set the hook, as are those with hard bodies.

<br><br><br>

<p>
Although the object of this book is to teach the Angler how to
tie his own flies a few words in regards to the writer's personal
experiences in using these Bugs might not be amiss at this time.
Floating Bugs are mostly tied on large size hooks and generally
used for {51} bass. However, I have had a great deal of luck and
many pleasant experiences with them tied as small as a #14 Model
Perfect hook, and used with a 4x Leader. The small sizes will take
many large trout, and are readily accepted by all pan fish. When
fishing in still waiters with the Floating Bugs, whether it be for
bass, pickerel, trout or pan fish I use a light leader, treated so
that it will sink. I cast to a likely looking spot, beside an old
stump along lily pads, or to an opening in the lily pads
themselves. I let the Bug hit the water with quite a splash, as a
living moth of the same size would, and there I let it lie,
absolutely motionless, as though stunned by the blow. By all means
do not be impatient, let the Bug lie perfectly still for two or
three minutes, and then simply move the tip of your rod just enough
to cause the Bug to quiver on the surface. Again let it lie
perfectly still for a minute or two; usually about the second time
the Bug is made to quiver you can expect a strike, and when a big
bass comes after one of these Bugs, he comes full of action. When
fishing fast water, I fish them exactly as I would a dry fly,
upstream or up and across the current. My personal choice for color
is the natural brownish grey body hair from either the deer,
reindeer, or caribou. Wings, tail and body all the same natural
color. I tie this pattern from size 2/0 Model perfect hook down to
size 14, and us {52} the larger sizes for bass and pickerel, and
the smaller sizes for trout and pan fish. I remember one very
pleasant experience that happened in northern Maine three years
ago. There is a small, deep, spring fed lake of about ten acres in
area, completely surrounded by wilderness; this lake had been
stocked with, Rainbow Trout and closed to all fishing for five
years. I was fortunate in being there about two months after it had
been opened to fishing and was invited to try my luck, after first
being advised that although some very nice catches were regularly
being taken on a Streamer Fly fished deep, also on live bait and
worms with a spinner, no one had even been able to take fish on the
surface. I arrived at this lake about one hour before dark, and it
was one of those evenings when the water was actually boiling with
rising trout. In fact never before or since have I seen so many
fish breaking water at the same time. I immediately made up my mind
to take fish on the surface. I began fishing with a small spider,
and changed fly after fly for the next half hour with the same
results as had been experienced by other dry fly fishermen. In
desperation and with darkness fast approaching I tied on a size 4
Grey Bug and cast about thirty feet from shore. The Bug hit the
water with quite a splash and didn't even as much as put down one
fish, and several continued to {53} rise from within a few inches
to a few feet from where the Bug landed. I waited a couple of
minutes and gave the Bug a little twitch, nothing happened, again I
twitched and again nothing happened. I began to believe I was
stumped when again the Bug was moved ever so slightly for the fifth
time, and remember this was at least seven minutes after it first
hit the water. A fish struck. In a few minutes I landed a 2 1/4
pound Rainbow. Before darkness had brought the day to a close I had
landed three more beautiful Rainbows averaging 2 pounds each. I had
never since had the opportunity to fish in this beautiful little
lake. Some day I hope to return, and again try, and I believe
succeed in taking these beautiful Rainbow Trout on the conventional
dry fly. However, this one little experience proved conclusively to
me the absolute necessity of patience in fishing Floating Bugs.

FLOATING BUGS: THEIR CONSTRUCTION (SEE DIAGRAM 9)
</h3>

<p>
First let us begin by making the most simple; that is, one that
has the Body, Wings, and Tail, all of the same material and color.
Follow the illustrations carefully and even your first attempt will
be a masterpiece.
</p>

<p align="left">
{54}
</p>

<p>
Although I use well waxed 00 tying silk, you will find that
regular sewing silk size A will work best on your first attempt.
First wax your thread thoroughly and take a few turns around the
shank of the hook and tie in a small bunch of hairs for the tail,
as in Diagram 9, Fig. 1, page (55). We will assume that we are using
regular deer hair cut from the hide. Next clip a small bunch of
hairs, about the size of a match, close to the hide. You will
notice there is some fuzz mixed with the hair at the base close to
the skin, pick out the fuzz and place the butts of the hairs under
the hook as in Fig. 2, Take a couple of loose turns with the tying
silk, hold the tips of the hair with the thumb and finger of the
left hand, and pull the tying silk down tight. You will notice that
the hairs spin around the hook and the butt ends will stand out
pretty much at right angles to the hook, as in Fig. 3. Cut off the
tip end of the hairs on the dotted line, press the hairs back
tightly, apply a drop of water-proof lacquer to the base of the
hairs and the hook, and repeat the same process of tying on a small
bunch of hair, each time pressing it back tightly. Remember this is
important, because the hair must be as close together as possible
to make a firm, smooth, buoyant body.

<br><br><br>

<p align="left">
{56}
</p>

<p>
When you have built the body up until it looks something like
Fig. 4, remove it from the vise and with a sharp pair of scissors
trim and shape it until it looks like Figs. 5 and 6. At this stage
you should have 3/16" of the shank of the hook left just behind the
eye, where you will tie on the wings. Cover this bare hook with the
well waxed tying silk, and lay a bunch of hair on top of the hook
for wings as Fig. 7. Crisscross the tying silk around the wings and
the hook until they are securely tied together. Place several coats
of lacquer over he junction of the wings and hook, to more securely
bind them in place. Lacquer the entire wings if you wish and when
they have partially dried, press them flat, spread them, trim them
as Fig. 8, and your Bug is completed.
</p>

<p>
Any combination of color may be used, different colored wings
and tail, different colored rings in the body. White body with red
tail and wings is a good pattern. Yellow body, black wings and tail
another. Various feather combinations can be used for wings and
tall. Create your own designs, and develop your patterns.
</p>

<h3 align="center">
CORK BODIED BASS BUGS (SEE DIAGRAM 10)
</h3>
<p>
These high floaters are easy to make and may be tied on most any
size hook desired. Kinked shank hooks should be used to prevent the
body from turning on the hook. Colored lacquer or enamel can be
used to decorate the bodies, and eyes can be either painted on, or
regular small glass eyes inserted and held in place with
water-proof glue or lacquer. Any of the fancy feathers that are
used for regular bass flies can be used for wings. Hair or feathers
can be used for tails, etc. Let us first make one of these cork
bodied Bugs on a size 1/0 hook. Take a 1/2" cork cylinder and with
a razor blade shape it roughly as Diagram 10, Figs. 1 and 2. Then
with a piece of 00 sandpaper held in the right hand and the
cylinder in the left it is a very simple matter to give the body a
nice smooth, shapely finish. Next cut a small V out of the body as
in Fig. 3. This is easier to fit to the hook and easier to cement
securely than simply making a slit in the cork. Press the V slit
over the hook as in Fig. 4. Apply cement or lacquer liberally to
the inside of the V slot, and to the hook shank. Press the piece
that was removed securely back into place, bind tightly with
string, as in Fig. 5, and let set over night. Next day when the
cement has thoroughly dried and the body is permanently fastened to
the hook, remove the string and with the sandpaper touch up any
rough places on the body, and give a coat of lacquer or enamel of
the desired color.

<br><br><br>

<p align="left">{59}
</p>

<p>
When the body enamel has dried, take a pair of feathers for
wings (whole feathers that have the quill in the centre, same as
are used for regular bass fly wings are best), and with the tying
silk bind these fast to the top side of the shoulders as in Fig. 6.
Tie on a tail close to the body, paint on the eyes, paint any other
color or designs you wish on the body, and the Bug is
completed.</p>

ANGLER'S KNOTS
</h4>

<p>
Figs. 1, 2 and 3 in Diagram 11, page (60) show a very convenient
way to tie a dropper loop in the leader; roll the gut between thumb
and finger at (A) Fig. 1, next invert loop (B) through (C) Figs. 2
and 3.
</p>

<p>
Figs. 4, 5, and 6 make the best knot for or a loop in the end of
a leader, gut snells etc. Pull loop (C) through loop (B) Figs. 5
and 6.
</p>

<p>
Figs. 7, 8, and 9 are about the easiest and most secure knots
for making leaders, the ends are in the centre of the finished knot
and can be clipped close.
</p>

<p>
Figs. 10, 11, and 12, the figure eight knot, is the best for
tying flies to the leader, it won't slip, and the pull is in line
with the hook shank.

<h4 align="center">MY FAVORITE FLIES
</h4>

<p>
Quite frequently I am asked which fly I like the best, or which
particular patterns I would choose should I carry only a few flies
with me on a trip. That is rather a difficult question to answer.
The season, the type of fishing and location must be taken into
consideration.
</p>

<p>
There must be some reason for so many hundreds of patterns. I
hardly believe that any half dozen patterns can be used with
constant success throughout the season, even in one particular
locality. There are times, when fish are feeding, that they will
take anything; again one may change fly after fly without success,
when finally a fly will be tried that will take fish on every cast.
Suppose that particular fly wasn't included in the chosen few, the
answer is obvious.
</p>

<p>
However, I will endeavor to choose six patterns each of the
various styles, and to give my reasons for their choice, but here I
assure you there will always be many more patterns in my fly box
for further trial, after I have exhausted my favorite six.</p>
<p>Beginning with dry flies, my first choice would be {63} a Quill
Gordon, on a size 16 hook. This fly closely represents the numerous
duns that are on or about the water, to some extent, during the
entire season. I have little faith in color in the dry fly, except
light or dark shades. I do believe that the size and shape have a
great deal more to do with the success of a dry fly than color. I
have proven to my own satisfaction that a Quill Gordon sparsely
dressed as it should be, but tied with a black hackle and yellow
mallard wings, is just as successful as the customary dressing.</p>
<p>My second choice would be the Red Ant. Although this fly belongs
to the order Hymenoptera, it can be used when many of the Diptera
order are on the water, such as Cowdung, Blue bottle, Bee, etc.
This family all have flat wings and make an entirely different
appearance than the aforementioned Quill Gordon. I tie the Red Ant
on a size 14 hook. I build the body first of red silk floss, shape
it like the body of an ant, give it a couple of coats of clear
lacquer and let it dry hard and shiny. This body will reflect
light, much as the natural insect. I then tie on two hackle tips
for wings. Have them about as long as the hook, spread them so they
are at about a 30 degree angle from the body and very flat. I then
use a brown saddle hackle with fibers about 3/4" long for legs. I
put on only two or three turns of the hackle, and then clip off all
of the top and bottom hackles, leaving only about six fibers
sticking {64} straight out on each side. This fly will float very
close to the water, and because of its sparse dressing, slightly
heavy body because of the lacquer, it is not a good floater. It
also has the disadvantage of being hard to see. However, it is
still my second choice, and properly dressed, and fished with a
very fine leader, will take many nice fish.
</p>

<p>
My third choice is the Fan Wing Royal Coachman. This fly was
never supposed to represent any particular family but I believe it
is taken by fish for the Lepidoptera, large-winged moths and
butterflies. It seems to be very successful when these are about in
the evening.
</p>

<p>
My fourth choice is the Furnace Spider. This fly I tie on a size
16 short shank hook, by winding only about three turns of a furnace
saddle hackle, with fibers about three fourths of an inch long.
Tied in this manner, without any body or tail, the fly will alight
on the water with the hook down, and looked at from beneath,
against the light, only the little black spot will be noticeable.
This I believe represents some of the order Coleoptera (beetles)
and also the small black gnat (Empidae). I know if no other ways to
tie the Black Gnat small enough to represent the natural insect,
and even on the very smallest hook, the artificial is usually many
times larger than the natural. The small black centre of the
furnace saddle hackle tied in this manner seems to represent the
size of the natural very {65} closely. This fly is a very good
floater and an excellent fly when trout are feeding on those small
insects.
</p>

<p>
My fifth choice is the Grannon. This fly is of the order of
Trihoptera, and has different shaped wings than any of those
previously mentioned, the wings being quite full and roof shaped.
It is on the water a good part of the season, and can be used when
other flies with this shape wing are about, such as the alder fly,
cinnamon fly, etc.
</p>

<p>
My next and sixth choice of dry fly would be the Brown Palmer,
made on a size 12 long shank hook with a full body of peacock herl,
and palmer hackle, wound not too full. This I believe is taken by
the trout for many of the caterpillars.
</p>

<p>
My personal choice of these six patterns should now appear quite
obvious, should it be necessary for me to limit myself to such a
small selection. I have selected one each of the six most prominent
orders, and should any one of the hundreds of families of these
orders be in prominence on the water, I would at least have the
correct size or color.
</p>

<p>
My choice of the standard pattern wet flies, Feather Streamers,
Bucktail Streamers, and nymphs would be a little more difficult. I
am a firm believer that color plays a very important part in the
dressing of wet flies, as well as size and style. I offer my
personal choice of these styles because of the consistency with
which they {66} have taken fish for me during many years of fishing
all parts of the country.
</p>

<p>
I do not hesitate to say that I have taken more trout, of all
kinds, on a brown hackle with peacock herl body, than any of the
other common wet fly patterns. This is probably because I have used
it more. I do believe that in the north, and especially for brook
trout, a fly with a little red in it is more productive. Therefore,
for northern fishing I would select Royal Coachman, Parmachene
Belle, and Montreal. Other favorite flies that are good most
anywhere in North America are Grizzly King, Queen O'Waters; Cahill,
and Grey Hackle.
</p>

<p>
Feather Streamers and Hair Streamers are being more extensively
used each year. Many authorities are of firm conviction that these
flies unquestionably represent small minnows, upon which the fish
are in the habit of feeding. This may be true, but I have seen many
rubber, metal and composition minnows, that were exact replicas of
the naturals, both as to color and size, and they would not take
fish as would the Feather or Hair Streamers, fished in the same
waters at the same time.
</p>

<p>
Most of my experience with Feather Streamers and also Hair
Streamers has been for Landlocked Salmon and Rainbow Trout, in big
waters. So I will list these according to the way they have
produced for me. The {67} Black Ghost on a #4 long shank hook has
been my most successful Feather Streamer. Probably because its
white streamers are easily seen by the fish. It will most always
raise fish, even if not the proper fly to make them strike. The
Grey Ghost is another, and one of the most popular streamers in the
North for Landlocked Salmon. This fly, as well as the Supervisor,
Spencer Bay Special and numerous other flies of this style, were
originally designed by their creators to represent the smelt, a
favorite food of the salmon. These flies vary so in their color
combinations that I wonder what the fish do take them for. However,
I do know that a Grey Ghost will work when a Supervisor will not,
and vice versa. One is grey and the other is blue. When fishing in
lakes with a Feather Streamer for trout I have consistently had
most luck with a creation of my own, Gregg's Demon. This fly was
never tied to represent anything, but I have taken many nice fish
on it, and have seen little fellows hardly as long as the fly
itself chase it, and try their best to bite it in two. There is
just something about it that has "fish appeal."
</p>

<p>
A Brown Bucktail with a silver body on a #6 3x long shank hook
rates number one in Bucktail streamers. Another excellent fly that
has been a favorite for years, is a Yellow and Red Bucktail, with a
silver body, the red only a narrow streak through the centre. This
fly has recently been named "Mickey Finn." A red and {68} white,
with silver or gold body is a real good pattern where there are
brook trout, and tied on a large hook is very good for bass.</p>
<p>I use one with all white bucktail and silver body, the same as I
do a Black Ghost, for locating fish. I find they will most always
show their presence, one way or another when a white fly is cast
near them.
</p>

<p>
An all yellow with black streak in the centre same as the
"Mickey Finn" is another very good combination. This is an
excellent pickerel and bass fly. In fact, most any of these Feather
Streamers and Bucktail Streamers tied on larger hooks, and used
with or without a spinner, are excellent lures for both bass and
pickerel.
</p>

<p>
Nymphs: I have explained elsewhere my liking these lures, and
can say little more except that I always carry the following color
combinations in various sizes. All tied according to styles
illustrated in the diagrams. Cream Belly with Dark Back; Yellow
Belly with Black Ribs and Dark Back; Green Belly with Dark Back;
Grey Belly and Gold Ribs with Dark Back; Brown Belly and Gold Ribs
with Black Back; Orange Belly and Black Ribs with Dark Back.

This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Produced by Hugh T. Mitten

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
