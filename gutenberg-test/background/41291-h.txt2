PUBLISHER'S NOTE


The material in this volume was gathered by the
Division of Adjustment of Homes and Family
Life of Studies in Methods of Americanization.

Americanization in this study has been considered
as the union of native and foreign born
in all the most fundamental relationships and
activities of our national life. For Americanization
is the uniting of new with native-born
Americans in fuller common understanding and
appreciation to secure by means of self-government
the highest welfare of all. Such Americanization
should perpetuate no unchangeable political,
domestic, and economic regime delivered
once for all to the fathers, but a growing and
broadening national life, inclusive of the best
wherever found. With all our rich heritages,
Americanism will develop best through a mutual
giving and taking of contributions from both
newer and older Americans in the interest of the
commonweal. This study has followed such an
understanding of Americanization.

FOREWORD


This volume is the result of studies in methods
of Americanization prepared through funds furnished
by the Carnegie Corporation of New York.
It arose out of the fact that constant applications
were being made to the Corporation for contributions
to the work of numerous agencies engaged
in various forms of social activity intended to
extend among the people of the United States
the knowledge of their government and the
obligations to it. The trustees felt that a study
which should set forth, not theories of social
betterment, but a description of the methods of
the various agencies engaged in such work, would
be of distinct value to the cause itself and to the
public.

The outcome of the study is contained in eleven
volumes on the following subjects: Schooling of
the Immigrant; The Press; Adjustment of
Homes and Family Life; Legal Protection and
Correction; Health Standards and Care; Naturalization
and Political Life; Industrial and Economic
Amalgamation; Treatment of Immigrant
Heritages; Neighborhood Agencies and Organization;
Rural Developments; and Summary.
The entire study has been carried out under the[viii]
general direction of Mr. Allen T. Burns. Each
volume appears in the name of the author who
had immediate charge of the particular field it
is intended to cover.

Upon the invitation of the Carnegie Corporation
a committee consisting of the late Theodore
Roosevelt, Prof. John Graham Brooks, Dr. John
M. Glenn, and Mr. John A. Voll has acted in
an advisory capacity to the director. An editorial
committee consisting of Dr. Talcott Williams,
Dr. Raymond B. Fosdick, and Dr. Edwin
F. Gay has read and criticized the manuscripts.
To both of these committees the trustees of the
Carnegie Corporation are much indebted.

The purpose of the report is to give as clear
a notion as possible of the methods of the agencies
actually at work in this field and not to
propose theories for dealing with the complicated
questions involved.

INTRODUCTION


The following study is the result of effort on the
part of several persons. Miss Helen R. Wright,
formerly research assistant of the Chicago School
of Civics and member of the staff of the Massachusetts
Immigration Commission of 1914, had
much to do with the planning of the inquiry, the
framing of such schedules as were used, and the
organization of certain portions of the information
gathered. Through Miss Laura Hood, long
time a resident of the Chicago Commons, it
proved to be possible to obtain many intimate
views with reference to the more subtle questions
of family adjustment in the groups that are of
special interest in such an inquiry as this.

Certain questions of uniformity in method and
style of presentation were determined by the
editorial staff of the Study of Methods of Americanization.
For the final drafting of a considerable
portion of the study, especially in the earlier
chapters, the members of this editorial staff are
responsible, though the writer is glad to acknowledge
full responsibility for all conclusions drawn
or recommendations offered.

NEW HOMES FOR OLD



I

FINDING THE NEW HOME


The great westward tide of immigration has
again begun to rise. Annually to the ports of
entry and to the great inland centers of distribution
come thousands of immigrant families,
strange men and women with young children, unattached
girls, and vigorous, simple lads. With
few exceptions no provision by native Americans
has been made for their reception in their
new places of residence. Communities of kindly-intentioned
persons, because of their lack of
imagination and their indifference, have allowed
the old, the young, the mother, and infant to
come in by back ways, at any hour of day or
night. Frequently they have been received only
by uncomprehending or indifferent railroad officials
or oversolicitous exploiters.


THE FIRST ADJUSTMENTS

It is not strange that in most American communities
there is no habit of community hospitality.[2]
Communities are in themselves transitory
and fluid. Many of the native born have
as yet become only partially adjusted to their
physical and social environment. At least the
childhood of most of our older generation was
spent under the influence of those who had either
migrated or immigrated. "Nous marchons tous."
We are all "pilgrims and strangers." Some have
come sooner, and some have come later, and except
for the colored people and those in territory
acquired in 1848 and in 1898, all have a common
memory of having come deliberately either from
something worse or to something better. All
have come from where they were into what was
a far country.

While the earlier arrivals are making their
own adjustments, there are knocking at their
gates strangers from a more distant country
speaking a foreign tongue, accustomed to totally
different ways of living and working. Their reception,
however, need not be an impossible task.
On their arrival they are formally admitted, and
information as to their origin and destination
must be supplied. Methods could be devised for
receiving them in such a way as to make them
feel at ease, and for interpreting to them the
changed surroundings in which they must find a
home and a job in the shortest possible time.

If discomfort and confusion were the only distress
into which the strange group fell, the situation[3]
might be only humiliating to our generous
and hospitable spirit and could be easily remedied.
But the consequences of failure to exercise
hospitality at the beginning endure in lack
of understanding on the part of both groups.
The immigrant fails to find natural and normal
ways of sharing in the life of the community,
and becomes skeptical as to the sincerity of perfectly
well-meaning, but uninformed, professions
on the part of the older residents. Spiritual
barriers as definite, if not as easily perceived, as
the geographical boundaries of the "colonies"
formed in the different sections of our cities,
develop.

This is often true in connection with the
foreign-born men and tragically more true of the
women. One Italian woman in Herrin, Illinois,
for example, who had lived nineteen years in
this country, told an investigator for this study
that she had never received an American into
her home as a guest, because no American had
ever come in that spirit. A Russian woman had
lived in Chicago for nine years and had, so far as
she knew, not become acquainted with any
Americans. Several instances were found in
which efforts have been put forward to secure
the united effort of the whole community, and
yet large groups of immigrants have remained
substantially unaware of these efforts and were
entirely untouched by them.[4]

There are several other attitudes, too, that
have perhaps blinded some to the need of provision
for community hospitality. One attitude
might be characterized as that of the "self-made
man." Hardship may have either of two different
effects. In one person it will develop
sympathy, compassion, and a desire to safeguard
others from similar suffering. In others it may
lead to a certain callous disregard of other people&mdash;a
belief that if one has been able to surmount
the difficulties others should likewise
be able. If not, so much the worse. This
kind of harshness characterizes the attitude
of some of those immigrants who have come
at earlier dates toward those who have come
later.



A RAILROAD CAMP FOR IMMIGRANT WORKERS IN A PROSPEROUS SUBURBAN
COMMUNITY, 1920

&nbsp;



AN IMMIGRANT RAILWAY WORKER LIVES IN THIS CAR WITH HIS WIFE, SIX
CHILDREN, AND THREE DOGS


It is like the occasional successful woman who
is indifferent to the general disadvantages of her
sex, and to the negro who makes for himself a
brilliant place and argues that color is no handicap.
In talking to women about bringing up
their children, it was a significant fact that some
of the women who had had no trouble with their
own children said that where there is trouble
it is the fault of the parents. The following
comment, for example, was on the schedule of
Mrs. D., a Polish woman who has been in this
country since 1894, and has three children, aged
twenty-five, twelve, and six. "If a child is not
good, Mrs. D. blames his mother, who does not[5]
know how to take care of children. She thinks
they are too ignorant."

There is also the sense of racial, national, or
class superiorities. The virtue of the Anglo-Saxon
civilization is assumed; the old, as against
the new immigration, is valued. There are many
who crave the satisfaction of "looking down" on
some one, and it makes life simpler if whole
groups&mdash;"Dagoes," "Hunkies," "Polacks," what
you will&mdash;can be regarded as of a different race
or group, so that neither one's heartstrings nor
one's conscience need be affected by their needs.
The difficulty is increased by a similar tendency
of immigrants to assume the superiority of their
people and culture and so hold aloof from the
new life. This assumption of superiority on both
sides tends to hinder rather than to further mutual
understanding.

Clearly, if we are to build up a united and
wholesome national life, such attitudes of aloofness
as have persisted will have to be abandoned.
If that life is to be enriched and varied&mdash;not
monotonous and mechanical&mdash;the lowly and the
simple, as well as the great and the mighty, must
be able to make their contribution. This contribution
can become possible, not as the result of
any compulsory scheme, but of conditions favoring
noble, generous, and sympathetic living. The
family is an institution based on the affection of
the parents and their self-sacrifice for the life[6]
and future of their children. Of all institutions
it exemplifies the power of co-operative effort,
and demands sympathetic and patient understanding.
This is perhaps especially true of the
foreign-born family.

This discussion of the family problems of the
foreign-born groups in relation to the development
of a national consciousness and a national
unity is based on the belief that no attempts at
compulsory adjustment can in the nature of
things be successful. Sometimes the interests of
the common good and of the weaker groups demand
for their own protection the temporary
exercise of compulsion, but the real solution lies
in policies grounded in social justice and guided
by social intelligence.


HOMES STUDIED

The material in this study is of a qualitative sort.
No attempt has been made to organize a statistical
study. The problems of family life do not
lend themselves to the statistical method except
at great cost of time and money.

A large body of data with reference to conditions
existing during the decade just prior to
the Great War, exists in the reports of several
special government investigations, especially the
report of the United States Immigration Commission,
that of the United States Bureau of
Labor relating to conditions surrounding women[7]
and child wage earners, and that of the British
Board of Trade on the "Cost of Living in American
Towns." The regular publications of certain
government bureaus, especially the United
States Children's Bureau, the Bureau of Home
Economics in the United States Department of
Agriculture, and the United States Bureau of
Labor Statistics, were found useful. These publications
have been studied so far as they discuss
the problem of family life. Their contents are
presented only in illustration or in confirmation
of statements made.

The material collected is of two kinds. First,
there are facts dealing with the different agencies
organized to help in solving these problems.
This information was gathered largely by correspondence.
Questionnaires were sent to case-work
agencies dealing with family problems,
which are members of the American Association
for Social Work with Families and Home Service
Bureaus of various Red Cross Chapters, asking
their methods for attacking these difficulties and
their advice as to the best methods worked out.
The supervisors of Home Economics under the
Federal Board for Vocational Education were
asked to what extent they had included foreign-born
housewives in their program and the special
plans that had been worked out for them; the
International Institutes of the Young Women's[8]
Christian Association were asked to describe
their work with married women.

The methods of certain agencies in Chicago&mdash;the
United Charities, the Immigrants' Protective
League, some of the settlements&mdash;were studied
more carefully through interviews with their
workers and through a study of individual records.
Officers of the national racial organizations
were interviewed about their work on family
problems. In addition to these a limited
number of co-operative stores in Illinois were
studied. Mining communities in Illinois, Pennsylvania,
and West Virginia were visited, as
well as certain of the newer housing projects,
such as Yorkship Village in New Jersey, Hilton
Village in Virginia, Bridgeport, Connecticut,
Lowell and North Billerica, Massachusetts and
several towns in New Mexico.

The government investigations already referred
to had made certain needs of the foreign born
very clear. It seemed unnecessary to go over
that ground again, but it was necessary to know
whether those needs still existed. An attempt
was made to learn this through interviews with
leaders of various national groups and by obtaining
schedules from a limited number of
selected families. A word should be said as to
the information obtained from these sources.
The leaders selected were, in the first instance,
men and women whose leadership in their own[9]
group had been recognized by election to important
offices in their national organizations. These
men and women then frequently suggested others
whose position was not so well defined to an outsider,
but whose opinion was valued by members
of the group.

Most of the persons interviewed were able to
speak English readily. They were people who
were close enough to the great mass of immigrants
to be familiar with their problems, their
needs, their shortcomings, and their abilities, and
at the same time were sufficiently removed from
the problems to be able to view them objectively.
Some were persons of more educational and cultural
background than the majority of immigrants,
some of them had been born in this
country or had come when they were young
children; but there were more who came to this
country from the same Old-World conditions as
the majority of their countrymen and had
worked their way through the same hard conditions.
They were probably exceptional in their
native ability.

No attempt was made to fill out a questionnaire
from these interviews. An outline was
prepared of points to be covered, but frequently
no attempt was made to adhere to the outline.
Rather, these persons were encouraged to talk
on the family problems in which they were most
interested, and to which they had given most[10]
thought&mdash;to enable us to see them as they saw
them with their knowledge of the Old-World
background from which their people had come.
They were also asked to suggest possible ways
of meeting the more pressing needs of their
people.

Adequate expression can never be given to the
obligation under which those busy men and
women who gave so generously and graciously
their time and their thoughts have placed us.
Our very great indebtedness to them is acknowledged,
as without their aid this study in the
present form would have been impossible. The
demand made upon them could be justified only
by the hope that the contacts thus established
may prove in some slight degree profitable to
them if only in giving them assurance that there
are those to whom their problems are of real
interest.

The women from whom family schedules were
obtained were slightly different, and the information
sought from them was obtained in a different
way. They were for the most part women
who did not speak English well enough to carry
on an extended conversation in it. While they
were not very recent immigrants and hence were
not going through the first difficulties of adjustment,
most of them were women who had not
yet worked their way through to the same place
reached by the women with whom the more[11]
general interviews were had. They were, in general,
very simple people, too absorbed with working
out their problems to have had much time
for reflection. We asked them to tell us of their
early experiences and difficulties as they recalled
them, and of their present ways of treating some
of the problems. This information was taken in
schedule form.

Not enough schedules were obtained to be of
statistical value&mdash;there were only ninety in all&mdash;but
the families chosen are believed to be more
or less typical. They were selected with the advice
of leaders of their group or were known to
our foreign-speaking investigators, who had a
wide acquaintance in several groups. That is,
we have tried so far as possible to see the problem
with the persons, if not through the eyes of
the persons whose fellow countrymen we wished
to know.

We do not mean to suggest that other and
very important groups might not have been
studied, but we tried to learn of others; and
sometimes because we could not find the clew,
sometimes for lack of time, it proved impossible
to go farther. We feel that we have obtained
an insight into the situation among the Polish
in Chicago and in Rolling Prairie, Indiana; the
Lithuanians, Bohemians, Slovaks, Croatians, Slovenians,
nonfamily Mexicans, Russians&mdash;both
family and nonfamily&mdash;and Italians in Chicago;[12]
Italians in Herrin and Freeman, Illinois, and
Canonsburg and Washington, Pennsylvania; and
the Ukrainians in Chicago and in Sun, West
Virginia.

Besides the large body of evidence with reference
to these groups, we have suggestions from
many interested and kindly persons of other
groups. The Magyars and the Rumanians, particularly,
we should have liked to know better,
and we have had most suggestive interviews
with certain of their leaders. We were not able,
however, to follow the leads they gave, and
therefore do not claim to speak for them, except
to express the feeling of the need for greater
understanding and appreciation.

With reference to those groups discussed, it
should be noted that some, such as the Polish,
Bohemian, Lithuanian, Italian, are among the
largest of the great foreign colonies in Chicago,
the growth of a long-continued immigration.
They live in the different sections of the city, in
crowded tenement districts, or in more recently
developed neighborhoods for whose growth they
are responsible. The Croatian and Ukrainian
groups are newer groups, and are therefore
poorer. The Croatians are moving into houses
which the Bohemians are vacating. In the Russian
and Mexican groups we have the current
evidence that the old problem of the nonfamily
man is still with us.[13]

The Poles in Rolling Prairie, Indiana, are a
prosperous farming community living in modern
farmhouses with yards and orchards. There are
women still alive who can tell of the earlier days,
when just after their arrival they lived in one-room
houses made of logs and plastered with
mud. Then they helped their husbands to fell
trees and clear the land. Like other pioneer
women, these women have contributed to the
"winning of the West." The grandmothers tell
of these things. The mothers remember when,
during the winter, the children went to school
for a few months, they were laughed at because
of their meager lunches, their queer homemade
clothes, and their foreign speech. The young
people now go to school at least as long as the
law requires and sometimes through high school.

The mining towns in Illinois and Pennsylvania
need not be described. Their general features
are familiar. Although extended information
with reference to the life of the various groups
was not obtained, mention will be made of certain
facts that are of importance to this study.

While the numbers are not great, it is hoped
that certain methods may be worked out for approach
to the problems of the groups studied,
that will prove suggestive in attacking the problems
of other groups not included here. No two
groups are alike; but the experience with one or
with several may develop the open-minded, humble,[14]
objective attitude of mind and that democratic
habit of approach that will unlock the
doorway into the life of the others and exhibit
both the points at which community action may
be desirable and the direction such action should
take.


DISSOLVING BARRIERS

The purpose of this book is to help in the adjustment
of immigrant family life in this country.
The immigrant will feel America to be his own
land largely to the extent that he feels his American
home to be as much his home as was his
native hearth. To define what makes a home is
harder even than to achieve one. Perhaps more
than any other human institution the home is a
development, the result and component of innumerable
adjustments. This growth comes
about largely spontaneously, without conscious
effort on the part of its members, except that of
living together as happily as possible.

There is among most housewives, whether native
or foreign born, a certain complacency about
housekeeping and bringing up children. Housekeeping
is supposed to come by nature, and few
women of any station in life are trained to be
homemakers and mothers. The native born, in
part consciously through their own choice and
in part blindly moved by forces they do not
understand, have been gradually moving away[15]
from the old tradition of subordination on the
part of the wife and of strict and unquestioning
obedience of children. In the general American
atmosphere there are suggestions of a different
tradition.

In the old country the mother knew what
standards she was to maintain and, moreover,
had the backing of a homogeneous group to help
her. In this country she is a stranger, neither
certain of herself nor sure whether to try to maintain
the standards of her home or those that seem
to prevail here. As a matter of fact, these difficulties
are usually surmounted, so that by the
time the foreign-born housewife has lived here
long enough to raise her family she has learned
to care for her home as systematically and intelligently
as most of her native-born neighbors,
who have not had her difficulties. Sometimes
they have learned from the members of the group
who have been here longer; and sometimes they
have learned by going into the more comfortable
American homes as domestic servants.

In the American domestic evolution a scientific
and deliberate factor has been introduced. Students
of family life have conducted inquiries
into domestic practices, needs, and resources,
and applied the researches of physiologists, chemists,
economists, and architects. The result has
been the discovery of certain standards and requirements
for wholesome family life. It must[16]
be admitted that the attempt at formulation of
standards for family life encounters difficulties
not found in the field of education or of health,
where the presence and service of the expert are
fairly widely recognized. For many reasons the
subject of the minima of sound family life has
been more recently attacked and is, in the nature
of things, more difficult of analysis and especially
of formal study. The impossibility, for example,
of applying to many aspects of the family problem
the laboratory methods of study or of examining
many of the questions in a dispassionate
and objective manner, must retard the scientific
treatment of the subject.

There are, however, some aspects of family life
with reference to which there may be said to be
fairly general agreement in theory if not in practice
in the United States. The content of an
adequate food allowance is generally agreed upon
by the students of nutrition, and the cost and
special features of an adequate diet for any group
at any time and place can therefore be described
and discussed. In the matter of laying the responsibility
for support of the family on the
husband and father, at least to the extent of
enabling the children to enjoy seven years of
school life and fourteen years free from wage-paid
work and the resulting exploitation, there
is wide agreement embodied in legislation.

Such standards are becoming gradually adopted[17]
and incorporated into domestic life through the
slow processes of suggestion, imitation, and
neighborly talks already mentioned. While the
slow establishment of social standards is required
for a complete and adequate adjustment of family
life on the basis of specialists' discoveries,
many systematic and formal efforts can be made
which will forward and accelerate the process.
These efforts can help to remove the feeling of
strangeness, perhaps the greatest obstacle in adjusting
home life; they should seek to connect
with the appreciations and sense of need already
felt by the women who are to be influenced.

There is necessity for thorough inquiry into
what are the points of contact in these problems
for immigrant women; what are their present
customs and standards in which the specialists'
knowledge can be planted with the prospect of a
promising combination of seed and soil. This
study indicates how great is the need of search
for the possibilities of just such organic connections.
Pending such further studies, this report
can do two things:

First, it can exhibit, so far as possible, the difficulties
encountered by foreign-born families in
attaining in their family relationships such satisfaction
as would constitute a genuine feeling of
hominess, and make the immigrant home an
integral part of the domestic development in
this country.[18]

Second, the report can suggest the deliberate
and systematic methods which can be effective
in introducing the immigrant family and specialists'
standards to each other. The services of
social agencies have been largely in this field, and
it is hoped that they may find in this book lines
for increased usefulness. Incidentally, evidence
will be presented to show that, in allowing many
of these difficulties to develop or to remain, the
community suffers real loss, and it is hoped that
in the following chapters suggestion will be found
of ways by which some of these difficulties may
be overcome and some of the waste resulting
from their continued existence be eliminated.

II

FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS


It is impossible to discuss the problems of adjustment
of the family life of the immigrant to
life in this country without taking notice of several
factors that complicate the problem. There
is first the disorganization in family life that is
incident to the migration itself. The members of
most of the families that come to this country
are peasants who are almost forced to emigrate
by the fact that the land they own will not support
the entire family as the children grow up
and establish families of their own.

There was, for example, among the families
visited for this study, a family from the Russian
Ukraine. The man's father was a peasant farmer
with six acres of land and a large family of
children. The income from this small property
was supplemented by hiring out as laborers on
the large estates near by. As the boys grew up
they left home. Two had already come to America
when the father of this family left in 1910. At
the time he left there were thirteen people trying
to get their living from six acres of land.[20]

Another family from the same country were
trying to live on the income from the farm of the
man's father, who had four acres of land and
five sons.


SEPARATED FAMILIES

In such families, and even in less extreme cases,
it is evident that the cash needed for the emigration
of the whole family is difficult to secure.
It often happens, therefore, that the family does
not emigrate as a group, but one member&mdash;usually
the man&mdash;goes ahead, and sends for the
rest as soon as he has earned enough to pay
their passage. It is then some time, usually from
two to four years and occasionally longer, before
he is able to send for his family.

One Ukrainian man interviewed in this study
came in 1906, leaving his wife and four children
in the old country. He had difficulty in finding
work he could do, wandered from place to place,
never staying long in one place, and it was eight
years before he had saved enough to send for
his family. Another man, a Slovenian, came in
1904, and was here seven years before he sent
his wife money enough so she could follow him.

Separations of this kind are often destructive
of the old family relationships. What they mean
in suffering to the wife left behind has been revealed
by some of the letters of husbands and
[21]wives in a collection of letters in The Polish Peasant,[1]
especially in the Borkowski series. These
are letters written by Teofila Borkowski in Warsaw,
to her husband, Wladek Borkowski, in
America, between the years 1893 and 1912.
During the early years the letters usually
thanked him for a gift of money and referred
to the time when she should join him in America.
"I shall now count the days and weeks. May
our Lord God grant it to happen as soon as
possible, for I am terribly worried," she wrote
in 1894.

As time goes on the intervals between the
gifts grew longer, and she writes imploring him
to send money if he is able, as she is in desperate
need of it. In 1896 she had been ill and in the
hospital. "When I left the hospital I did not
know what to do with myself, without money
and almost without roof ... so I begged her and
promised I would pay her when you send some
money" (p. 353). And in 1897 she wrote:

For God's sake what does it mean that you don't answer?...
For I don't think that you could have forgotten me
totally.... Answer me as soon as possible, and send me
anything you can. For if I were not in need I should never
annoy you, but our Lord God is the best witness how terribly
hard it is for me to live. Those few rubles which you
sent me a few times are only enough to pay the rent for
some months.... As to board, clothes, and shoes, they are
earned with such a difficulty that you have surely no idea.
And I must eat every day. There are mostly days in my
present situation when I have one small roll and a pot of[22]
tea for the whole day, and I must live so. And this has
lasted almost five years since you left (p. 353).

She is pathetically grateful when money is sent.
Thus in 1899 she writes:

I received your letter, with twenty rubles and three
photographs, for which I send you a hearty "God reward!"
I bear it always in my heart and thought and I always
repeat it to everybody that you were good and generous,
and you are so up to the present (p. 358).

Her sufferings are not confined to financial
worries and lack of a place to eat and sleep.
There is apparently a loss of social prestige and
a falling off of friends. The letters also show
what was evidently a real affection for her husband,
and that at times his silence was even
worse than his failure to send money. Thus in
1905, when the money and the letters were very
irregular, she writes a letter (p. 362) in which
no reference is made to her economic situation.
After asking if he received her last letter, she
continues:

It is true, dear Wladek, that you have not so much time,
but my dear, write me sometimes a few words; you will
cause me great comfort. For I read your letter like a
prayer, because for me, dear Wladek, our Lord God is the
first and you the second. Don't be angry if I bore you
with my letters, but it is for me a great comfort to be able
to speak with you at least through this paper.

Her financial situation grows steadily worse, and
in 1912 she writes that she is "already barefooted[23]
and naked." The series closes with a letter
from a friend stating that she is ill and in
the hospital, "not so dangerously sick, but suffering
very much ... and very weak from bad
nutrition and continuous sorrows." He closes:
"And please write a little more affectionately.
Only do it soon, for it will be the best medicine
for your wife, at least for her heart" (p. 368).


KEEPING BOARDERS

The life of the man who has come ahead has
been made the subject of special study from
time to time,[2] especially with regard to the housing
conditions in which he lives&mdash;as a lodger or
a member of a nonfamily group of men. It has
been shown in all these studies that whatever
the plan worked out, he adapts himself either to
a life of intimate familiarity with women and
children not his own, or to a life in which children
and women have little part.

In connection with the present study, the living
conditions of some of the Mexicans and Russians
in Chicago were studied. As in the past,
the men were found living in one of the following
ways: as a lodger in the family group, as a
boarder paying a fixed sum for room and board,
[24]or as a member of a group of men attempting
to do their own housekeeping. The Mexicans
studied included 207 men, of whom 197, or 95
per cent, are unmarried. The Russians included
112 men, of whom 65, or 58 per cent, had wives
in Russia. It is interesting to note that 136 of
the 207 Mexican men were boarding, usually
with a Mexican family, 37 were lodgers, and 34
were doing co-operative housekeeping. Among
the Russians, on the other hand, there were 25
doing co-operative housekeeping, and 85 living
with family groups, of whom only a few paid a
fixed sum for room and board, while the others
paid a fixed rate for lodging and the food bill
depended on the food that was consumed.




&nbsp;



EVEN A BOARDING HOUSE OF EIGHTEEN BOARDERS IN FIVE ROOMS IS MORE
CHEERFUL THAN A LABOR CAMP FOR MEN ALONE


Four variations were found in the method of
paying for food: (1) The landlady buys all the
food for the group and her family on one account.
The total bill is divided by the number of boarders
plus the head of the family, the wife and children
getting their food as partial compensation
for her services. (2) Each lodger has his own
account book, in which is entered only the meat
purchased for him. He pays this account himself.
The other food purchased is entered in the
landlady's book, and divided in the same manner
as before. (3) Each lodger has his own account
and buys what he wants. Instead of paying for
what he has bought, he pays his share of the
total food bought during the week. (4) Each[25]
lodger has his own account, the family has its
own, and each pays his own.

Whatever expedient is adopted as a substitute
for normal family life, the result is unsatisfactory.
The men studied almost without exception
preferred living as boarders with a family
group, if possible. This preference is easily
understood, as it meant less work for the men,
who, in co-operative groups, had to do women's
work as well as their own, and it also seemed a
closer approximation to normal living. For the
sake of these advantages they were willing to put
up with housing conditions that were worse than
those of the men who tried co-operative housekeeping.
Thus 56 per cent of the Russian men
in co-operative groups had the four hundred
cubic feet of air per man that is required by law,
and only 35 per cent of those living with family
groups had this requirement.

The presence of a lodger in the family, moreover,
is attended with great discomfort to the
family. He is given the best accommodations
the house affords and the family crowds into
what is left. Thus, in the family groups with
whom the Russians were living, only 18 per cent
of the adult members of the family had the four
hundred cubic feet of air required by the city
ordinance for a person over twelve, as compared
with 35 per cent of the boarders or lodgers, and
forty of the fifty-three children in the groups[26]
were deprived of the two hundred cubic feet of
air space that is prescribed for them.

The people with whom we have conferred in
this study have said again and again that the
lodger in a family meant restriction and deprivation
for the family, and especially for the children.
One Lithuanian woman who came to this
country when she was two years old, says she
well remembers the "utter misery" of her childhood,
due to the lodgers. They were given all
the beds and any other sleeping arrangements
that could be contrived, and the children slept
on the floor in any corner. Their sleep was often
disturbed by people moving about. Sometimes
they were wakened and sent to the saloon to get
beer for a group of lodgers who sat up late playing
cards and drinking. She remembers, too, the
constant quarreling over the food bill, and thinks
that is very common.

The complicated system by which the accounts
are kept, to which attention has already
been called, makes suspicion on the part of the
lodger only too easy. Several people have spoken
of the unsteady character of the lodger and the
practice of staying up late, drinking. One of the
women interviewed said that the family life was
much easier, now that it was no longer necessary
to keep lodgers, for when there were lodgers in
the house they always had beer, and her husband
would drink with them. Other people have[27]
spoken of the women drinking with the lodgers,
and it was said that anyone who read the foreign-language
newspapers would see many such advertisements
as: "I am left alone with my three
children; my wife has gone off with a lodger.
Anyone having information, please communicate
with..."


THE MAN WITHOUT A FAMILY

Life in a men's co-operative housekeeping establishment
is usually more difficult, for upon them
falls the burden of maintaining cleanliness in the
household, and in many cases preparing their
own meals. Some of the Mexican men visited at
nine o'clock in the evening were preparing food
for the next day's lunch. An important consideration
here is the high cost of living under such
conditions. The immigrant woman may not be
a skillful buyer, but the immigrant man is evidently
a most extravagant one. Among the
Mexicans, for example, it was found that the men
living in co-operative groups paid practically as
much for the food which they themselves prepared
as the men living in boarding houses paid
for board and room. Their food cost seven to
eight dollars per man per week.

These studies showed the same lack of opportunities
for wholesome recreation and for meeting
nice girls, as well as the same restlessness of
the men as did earlier studies. This was especially[28]
noticeable among the Mexicans, who spoke
with longing of their Mexican dances that lasted
two days and were held almost every week-end,
and of the band concerts to which they could
often go. No matter how poor their furniture,
most of them had one or two musical instruments
which they played, and usually there was one
phonograph for the group. They found these
poor substitutes for group music, where they
could have not only the music but the social
time.

In brief, these studies of nonfamily men in
1919 show that the problem of adequate housing
and some form of normal social life for the
men who come ahead of their families is a recurring
one. The nationality of the group
changes as one immigration wave succeeds another.
With the change in nationality come
minor changes in the needs and desires of the
group, but the main problem remains the same.
It should never be forgotten that the impressions
these men receive during their early life in the
United States form the basis of their judgment
concerning American life. Moreover, the life
they lead during this period of separation from
their families must inevitably affect their family
relationships when family life is re-established,
whether it be in this country or in the country
from which they come.

The first national recognition of the needs of[29]
the men was evident in the plans of the United
States Housing Corporation.[3] These provided
for separate lodging houses for men, where each
man had a room of his own, with an adequate
amount of air space, and where bathing and
toilet facilities were provided. Recreational needs
were met by having a smoking room, reading
room, and billiard room in each house, and, unless
provided elsewhere in the community, bowling
alleys in the basement. It has been repeatedly
emphasized to us that the men would not be
satisfied unless a lodging house for them were
run by some one who could speak their language,
knew their national tastes, and could understand
their problems. The availability of houses of
this type to the immigrant men in nonfamily
groups would depend to a great extent on their
administration, but it is apparent that such a
housing plan is not impossible of attainment.


THE SINGLE WOMAN

It is not always the man who comes alone to this
country. Often the girl comes in advance of the
others and sends money back to bring over her
parents and younger brothers and sisters. Attention
has been called again and again to the
hazards for the girl thrown on her own resources
in a strange country among people she does
[30]not know, whose language she does not understand.[4]

She has, in fact, the same problem to solve
as the man who has come alone, but she is further
hampered both by economic and social handicaps.
She is probably from a country where the
life of a woman has been protected and circumscribed,
and to find herself in a country where
the conditions and status of women are freer,
makes both for confusion and complications. A
false step is of more serious consequence to her
than to a man, and without guidance and assistance
she may sometimes take this in ignorance
or thoughtlessness.

Equally changed are her living conditions here.
She has the same ways of living open to her that
are open to the man&mdash;boarding or lodging with
a family group or setting up a co-operative household
with a group of girls. The girl living in the
latter way does not have as many difficulties as
the man in the same situation, for women are
used to doing housework. Yet if men find it too
difficult to be both wage earners and housekeepers,
it is surely too hard for girls.

If, on the other hand, the girl finds lodging
with a family group, life is not much easier, for
she is expected to help with the household tasks,
[31]even though she is charged as much as the man
lodger, who usually is exempt from any household
responsibility. The inevitable assumption
that any extra tasks of housework or sewing
should fall to the women may make for a disproportionately
long and tedious day for the
woman lodger. The compensation of having the
protection and sociability of a family group may
thus be outweighed by the burden of overwork.
Added to this, the prevalent necessity of overcrowding
the households with boarders, puts a
hardship upon women that often is not felt by
men.

The need of providing adequate and safe lodging
for the girl away from home has been felt in
many places and by numerous organizations.
Too often facilities have appealed only to the
native born or thoroughly initiated immigrant
girl. The International Institute of the Young
Women's Christian Association has helped immigrants
to find suitable homes. This has local
branches in more than thirty cities, many of
which are helping to meet the housing problems
of the immigrant girls.

The government, in its housing projects, provided
accommodations for the single girls similar
to those provided for single men. They built
boarding houses for from seventy-five to a hundred
and fifty girls, with separate rooms and adequate
toilet and bathing facilities. Each floor[32]
had a matron's office, so placed as to overlook
the entrance and access to the sleeping quarters,
and there was either a reception parlor or alcove
for every twenty women, or a large parlor with
furniture arranged for privacy in conversation.
An assembly hall was provided with movable
partitions and set stage. Kitchenette, sitting
room, and sewing room were provided on at
least alternate floors, and the building contained
an infirmary and laundry for the use of the
girls.[5]

Information is not at hand as to whether any
of these houses were used by groups of immigrant
girls. Similar houses could, however, easily be
made useful for them if care were taken to put
them in charge of some one who understood the
problems of the foreign-born girl. More desirable
still are projects undertaken by groups of
foreign-born women themselves.[6] In this way
the problems and tastes of the different nationality
groups are taken into consideration, confidence
and co-operation on the part of the girls
more easily won, and an independent and ultimately
self-directed plan will be realized.








ALMOST AT THE END OF THE JOURNEY

THE MIGRANT FAMILY

Even when all the family has reached this country
the problems of migration have not always
[33]ended. Many families do not establish a permanent
home in the first place in which they
settle, but move from place to place, and in each
place there is a new set of conditions to which to
adjust themselves. Of the ninety families visited
in Chicago for this study, information on this
point was obtained from only forty-two. Nineteen
of these came directly to Chicago, but
twenty-three had lived in other places. Five of
them had been in the Pennsylvania mining district
around Pittsburgh, two had been in North
Dakota on a farm, two had been in a New Jersey
manufacturing town, and the others had been at
widely different places in other cities&mdash;New York,
Philadelphia, Galveston, Texas, Boston&mdash;in small
towns in the Middle West, and on plantations in
Louisiana.

Some had moved several times. A Polish family,
for example, had lived first in Boston, then
in New York City, then somewhere in Canada,
before they finally settled in Chicago. Another
Ukrainian family, from Galicia, lived first in one
mining town in Pennsylvania, then in another in
the same state, and later moved to Chicago.
The mother, who is a very intelligent woman,
described her first impression of America when
she, with her four children, arrived in the little
mining town. She said that immigrants were
living there, everything was dirty and ugly, and
she was shocked by the number of drunken men[34]
and women she saw on the streets, "having not
been accustomed to see them in the old country."
She wished to return immediately and did not
even want to unpack her belongings. For a
whole year she lived amid these squalid surroundings,
until her husband got work in another
town where conditions seemed a little better.

Sometimes these changes mean family separations,
as the man again goes ahead, as he did in
coming to this country. The experience of a
Polish family is typical. When the family first
came to this country they went to Iron Mountain,
Michigan, where the father worked in the
ore mines until he lost his health. Then a sister
of his wife, who was living in South Chicago, invited
him to visit her family, and offered to get
work for him in the steel mills. He came, living
with his sister-in-law, and after a few months
obtained work in the mills. Then the mother
and children followed him.


FROM FARMING TO INDUSTRY

Another fact to which attention should be called
is the adjustment in family life required by contact
with the modern industrial system. Some
of the immigrant groups come from countries
more developed in an industrial way than others,
but none of the newer groups come from any
country in which the factory system has become
so prevalent as in the United States. In the old[35]
country the family still exercised productive
functions as a unit. It had access to tillable
land, and was an essential part of an industrial
system that is still organically related to the
stage of development of the country. It had,
therefore, within itself, the sources of self-support
and self-determination. The civilization of which
it was a part may be a declining civilization;
but the conditions of life were those to which
the wife and mother were accustomed. She took
them for granted, felt at home among them, and
was not conscious of being overwhelmed by them.

In the modern American industrial community,
however, the family as a whole is generally
divorced from land. It is not a unit in relation
to the industrial organization, but in its productive
function is usually broken up by it. For
the family must live, and yet its income is dependent,
not upon its size nor the volume of its
needs, but upon the wage-earning capacity of
the man under the prevailing system of bargaining.
That the resulting income has often been
wholly inadequate, even according to the modest
standards set by dietetic experts and by social
investigators, is testified to by an enormous body
of data gathered during the decade preceding
the Great War.[7]
[36]
It is unnecessary to review these studies in
detail, but attention may be called to the findings
of the Immigration Commission. Of the foreign-born
male heads of households studied, 4,506, or
34.1 per cent, earned less than four hundred dollars
a year at a time when dietetic experts agreed
that five hundred dollars was a minimum below
which it was dangerous for families to fall. Seventy
per cent earned less than six hundred
dollars.

These figures may be said to come from "far
away and long ago," but while there has not
been time for widespread inquiry, there is a considerable
body of evidence indicating that the
same condition prevails to-day. Wages have increased
greatly during the war, but with the increase
in prices there is doubt as to whether real
wages have increased or decreased. Certainly
the increase has been irregular and uneven,
affecting the workers in some industries much
more than in others.

The New York State Industrial Commission
made a study of the average weekly earnings of
labor in the factories of the state. They found[37]
that between June, 1914, and June, 1918, wages
had increased 64 per cent.[8] The United States
Bureau of Labor Statistics made a study of food.
Taking the year 1913 as the base, or 100, wages
in 1907 were 92 and the retail prices of food, 82,
and in 1918 wages were 130 and food 168. That
is, the price of food increased much more rapidly
than the average union wage scale between 1907
and 1918.[9]

As a result of these low earnings, the wife and
children in many immigrant families have been
forced into the industrial field and even then the
resulting incomes have often been inadequate.
The Immigration Commission found that almost
one third of the foreign-born families studied had
a total family income of under five hundred dollars,
and almost two thirds had incomes less than
seven hundred and fifty dollars.

Not only is the family income often inadequate
and composite, but precarious and uncertain.
The need for food is a regularly recurring need;
the demand for labor may be seasonal, periodically
interrupted, and in time of crisis wholly
uncertain.

Although child labor laws have been enacted
in many states and by the United States Congress,
they are comparatively recent. Their
absence in earlier years has had its inevitable
[38]effect on many foreign born. Many of the leaders
in the immigrant groups who came here when
they were still children, tell of stopping school
and going to work. One Lithuanian woman,
who is among the more prosperous of the group
in Chicago, said that she stopped school when
she was twelve, and went to work in a fruit-packing
concern, working ten hours a day and
earning five dollars a week, which she gave to
her father. Another worked as a cash girl in a
downtown store at the age of thirteen. Similarly,
in one of the Russian families now living
in Chicago, the girls were fourteen and nine when
they came to this country and settled in a New
Jersey town. The older was sent to work at
once, and the younger a year later. Now, after
nine years in this country, neither girl can speak
English.

The present laws are not always efficiently
enforced, and the child of the foreign born suffers
especially from such failure to enforce the law.
In one of the mining communities of Illinois,
visited in the spring of 1919, Italian boys as
young as twelve were found working in the mines.
In New Mexico, children of twelve and ten, and
even younger, were taken out of school each
year in the spring to go with their fathers to
work on other men's farms or to herd sheep. Our
investigator was impressed, in Rolling Prairie,
with the need of including agriculture among the[39]
occupations from which young children are prohibited
as wage earners.


THE WAGE-EARNING MOTHER

Of the mother's work, notice must be taken.
People interviewed in this study were almost
unanimously of the opinion that immigrant
women were adding to the family income in
many cases. If the children are too young to be
left alone, the father's inadequate income is supplemented
by taking lodgers. Too often, however,
the mother works outside the home for
wages.

Indeed, a number of people were of the opinion
that the employment of women has increased
during the war. Among the more recently arrived
Bohemians, for example, it was said that
mothers of small children were going to work as
never before, because taking lodgers was not
possible, as single men have not been coming in
such large numbers since the war. The older
settlers felt that they must take advantage of
the relatively high wages offered women to make
payments on property. Lithuanian observers say
that partly because of prejudice against it, Lithuanian
married women have not gone out of their
homes to work until recently. With the war, the
increased cost of living, the higher wages offered
to women, and the appeal that was made to their
patriotism, many women had gone into industry,[40]
especially to work in "the yards." Ukrainian
and Slovenian women are also said to be working
in large numbers, but Croatian women are still
said to stay in their homes and contribute to the
income by taking lodgers.

In addition to this testimony, which was obtained
from leaders of the national groups, there
is also the information obtained from individual
families. Of the ninety women from whom information
was obtained in Chicago, twenty were
working outside their homes and twenty-four had
lodgers at the time of the study. When it is remembered
that these families were those who
have worked their way through the first difficulties,
these figures become doubly significant.

There is, for example, a Ukrainian family from
the Russian Ukraine. It consists of the parents
and four children between the ages of three and
fifteen. Ever since the family came to the
United States they have had one or more lodgers
to help them pay the rent. At present they have
three men paying four dollars a month each; and
as the father, who had been working in the stockyards
for nineteen dollars a week, was discharged
two months ago, the wife has been working in a
spring factory to support the family.

Then there is a Polish family, composed of the
parents and four children under fourteen, two
of them children of the man by a former wife.
The father has been in this country since 1894,[41]
but his wife has been here only since 1910. For
two years after their marriage the wife worked
at night, scrubbing from 6.30 to 9.30 p.m., and
received twenty-four dollars a month. Then
there was an interval while her children were
babies, during which she did not work, but the
family lived on the earnings of the father. For
the last two years, however, his work has been
slack, first because of a strike, and later due to
an industrial depression in his trade, and the
mother is again at work, this time in a tailor
shop, earning ten dollars a week.

The effect of the mother's work in decreasing
the child's chances for life has been made clear
by the studies of the Children's Bureau in Johnstown,[10]
Montclair,[11] and Manchester,[12] in all of
which a higher rate of infant mortality was
shown for children of mothers gainfully employed.

The effect of the mother's work on the family
relationship and the home life of the family group
is, of course, not measurable in absolute terms.
The leaders of the various national groups, however,
have repeatedly emphasized the fact that
the absence of the women from the home has
created entirely new problems in the family life.
[42]They have pointed out that while the peasant
women have been accustomed to work in the
fields in the old country, their work did not take
them away from their homes as the work in this
country does. If they were away there was usually
some older woman to take care of the children.
Here the work of the mother frequently
results in neglect of the children and the home.

In recognition of this fact attempts have been
made to solve the problem. Among Slovenians
it was customary, before the war made it impossible,
to send the children back to the old country
to their grandmothers to be cared for. One
priest said he had seen women taking as many
as twelve children to a single village. The
Ukrainians in Chicago have talked of establishing
a day nursery to look after their children, but
the people are poor, and it has not been possible
to raise the money. In the meantime children
are not sent to the day nurseries already established,
but are commonly taken to neighbors,
some of whom are paid for taking care of ten or
twelve children. This arrangement constitutes
a violation of the city ordinance requiring day
nurseries to be licensed, but is evidently a violation
quite unconsciously committed by both
parties to the transaction.

A group of nonworking Lithuanian women
heard that neglected children were reported to
the settlement in the neighborhood. One of the[43]
women investigated, and found many children
locked in houses for the day, with coffee and
bread for lunch. One child, too small to shift for
himself, was found with his day's supply of food
tied around his neck. The women decided to
open a nursery in charge of a Lithuanian woman
who would be able to speak to the children in
their own language, as few children below school
age spoke English. The original plans were to
accommodate ten or twelve children, but as soon
as the nursery opened there were so many women
wanting to leave their children there that it took
as many as thirty children. The nursery was
maintained for about eighteen months, and was
then closed because of the difficulty of raising
the necessary funds.

Some such plan must be developed that takes
care of the foreign-born mother's work if she
is forced to supplement the family's income outside
of the home. The organization of family
life that has grown up parallel with the industrial
system assumes her presence in the home.
When misfortune makes this impossible some
provision for caring for the children must be
found.


CHANGED DUTIES OF A MOTHER

Another changed condition in the life in this
country is that the family group is usually what
the sociologist calls the "marriage" group, as[44]
distinguished from the "familial" group, which
is generally found in the old country. The
grandmothers and maiden aunts, who were part
of the group in the old country, and who shared
with the mother all the work of the household,
are not with them in this country. The older
women are seldom brought on the long journey,
and the maiden aunt is either employed in the
factory system, or she sets up a house of her own,
so that in any event her assistance in the work
of the household can no longer be relied on. It
is perhaps the grandmother that is missed the
more, because it was to her that the mother of
a family was wont to turn for advice as well as
assistance.

This decrease in the number of people in the
household is not compensated for by the diminution
in the amount of work, which is another
fact of changed conditions. For in this country
the housewife no longer spins and weaves, or
even, as a rule, makes the cloth into clothing.
She does not work in the fields, or care for the
garden or the farm animals, all of which she was
expected to do in the old country. The loss of
the older women in the group, however, means
that what tasks are left must all be done by her.

The duties of the housewife may not be as
many, but the work they involve may be more.
This is true, for example, in the matter of feeding
the family. In Lithuania soup was the fare three[45]
times daily, and there were only a few variations
in kind. Here the family soon demands meat,
coffee, and other things that are different from
the food she has cooked in the old country....
Occasionally the situation is further complicated
by the insistence of dietetic experts that the immigrant
mother cannot feed her family intelligently
unless she has some knowledge of food
values. In other words, the work of the housewife
was easy in the old country because it was
well done&mdash;if it was done in the way her mother
did it&mdash;and conformed to the standards that
she knew. It could thus become a matter of
routine that did not involve the expenditure of
nervous energy. Here, on the other hand, she
must conform to standards that are constantly
changing, and must learn to do things in a way
her mother never dreamed of doing them. And
there is the new and difficult task of planning the
use of the family income, which takes on a new
and unfamiliar form.

In spite of all that has been taken out of the
home the duties of the housewife remain manifold
and various. She is responsible for the care of
the house, for the selection and preparation of
food, for spending the part of the income devoted
to present needs, and for planning and sharing
in the sacrifices thought necessary to provide
against future needs. She must both bear and
rear her children. The responsibilities and satisfactions[46]
of her relationship with her husband
are too often last in the list of her daily preoccupations,
but by no means least in importance,
if one of the essentials of a home is to be
maintained.

The enumeration of the tasks of any wife and
mother throws into relief the difficulties of the
foreign-born mother. The all too frequent cases
where homes are deprived of her presence emphasize
how indispensable she is. All case-work
agencies have had to grapple with the problem
of families suffering this deprivation. It is these
motherless families that make us realize how
many tasks and responsibilities fall to the lot of
the mother.

There was a motherless Russian family, consisting
of the father and six children, the oldest
a girl of thirteen and the youngest a five-month-old
boy. For a time the family tried to get along
without asking advice of an outside agency. The
baby was placed with friends, and the thirteen-year-old
girl stopped school to care for the five-room
flat and the other four children. In a short
time the family with whom the baby was placed
wanted to adopt him, and refused to keep him
longer on any other condition. At this time the
Immigrant's Protective League was appealed to
for help in placing the baby where he would not
have to be given for adoption. They found the
father making a pathetic attempt to keep the[47]
home and children clean, and the oldest girl,
Marya, trying hard to take her mother's place.
The best plan they were able to work out for the
family was institutional care for the youngest two
children, nursery care outside of school hours for
the next two, and the two oldest left to take care
of themselves, although given lunch at the school.
Marya, of course, was sent back to school, and
she and her father share the housekeeping.


PATERNAL AUTHORITY PASSING

A third change should be taken into account.
There is a marked difference between the general
position of women and children in relation
to the authority of the husband and father in
this country and that in the old country. It is
indicated in both general opinion and express
statutory amendment in this country, although
not in the so-called common law. The latter, in
common with practice in the native lands of
immigrants, provided that marriage gave the husband
the right to determine where the domicile
should be, the right "reasonably to discipline"
wife and children, the right to claim her services
and to appropriate her earnings and those of the
children, the right to take any personal property
(except "paraphernalia" and "pin money") she
might have in full ownership, the right to manage
any land she might become entitled to, and
the right to enjoy the custody of the children,[48]
regardless of the maintenance of his conjugal
fidelity, in the absence of such obscene and
drunken conduct on his part as would be obviously
demoralizing to the young child.

There existed no adequate provision for enforcing
the father's performance of either conjugal
or parental obligations, and the result has
been the development of two bodies of legislative
change. One of these has granted to the wife
certain rights as against the husband, on the
theory that the wife retains her separate existence
after marriage and should retain rights of
individual action. The other body of statutes
imposes on the man the duty of support, making
abandonment or refusal to support punishable
by fine or imprisonment, or both.

The theory of this legislation is that the support
of wife and children is to be a legally enforceable
duty, which may rightly be laid upon
the man because of his special interest and special
ability. Moreover, through the establishment of
the juvenile court, the community has undertaken,
not only to say that support must be
given, but to set a standard of "proper parental
care" below which family groups are not to be
allowed to sink and still remain independent
and intact. By creating the juvenile probation
staff, an official assistant parent is provided. In
the same way, by authorizing commitment of
children to institutions, the dissolution of the[49]
home that falls persistently to too low a standard
is made possible.

The common law, as accepted in the various
states, was not entirely uniform, but it was substantially
the universal family law; now the
states differ widely in the body of statutory
enactments developed in this field. All have
some laws recognizing the claims of children to
have their home conditions scrutinized&mdash;though
they may have no express juvenile-court law, all
recognize to some extent the separate existence
of the married women&mdash;though only twenty-one
have given the mother substantial rights as
against the father over their children, and they
all recognize the parent's duty to secure the
child's attendance at school, and have imposed
some limitation on the parent's right to set his
young child to work. In other words, in all the
states the idea of the separate existence of the
wife and of the interest of the community in the
kind of care given the child has been embodied in
legislation.

These statutes have been enacted by legislatures
composed largely, if not exclusively, of
men, and register the general change in the community
attitude toward the family group. An
unlimited autocracy is gradually becoming what
might now be termed a constitutional democracy.
But the law of the jurisdictions from which
most of the immigrant groups come, undoubtedly[50]
represents a theory of family relationship not
widely different from that underlying the common
law. The South Italian group, in which the
right of the father to discipline wife and daughter
is passed on to the son, may represent an extreme
survival of the patriarchal idea; but almost all
the foreign-born groups hold to the dominion of
man over woman, and of parents over children.

Immigrant groups evidence their realization of
the changed conditions in different ways. Among
the Ukrainians in Chicago, for example, it is said
that, whereas in the old country the men kept
complete control of the little money that came
in, here they very generally turn it all over to
their wives. Some of them have laughed, and
said that America was the "women's country."
Among other groups, notably the Jugo-Slav and
the Italian, there is said to be a general attempt
to keep the women repressed and in much the
same position they held in the old country.
Sometimes the woman perceives the difference in
the situation more quickly than her husband.
Then if he attempts to retain the old authorities
in form and in spirit, she may submit or else she
may gradually lead him to an understanding.
But she may not understand and yet may rebel
and carry her difficulty to the case-work agency.

One of the settlements in Chicago is said to
have become very unpopular with the men in
its neighborhood, as it has the reputation of[51]
breaking up families, because women who have
been ill treated by their husbands have gone to
the settlement to complain, and have there been
given help in taking their complaints to court.

The Immigrant's Protective League in Chicago
receives many complaints from women who have
learned that their husbands have not the right
to beat them or their children. One Lithuanian
woman, who had been in this country six years,
came to the league with the statement that her
husband often threw her and their eight-year-old
son out of the house in the middle of the night.
Another Lithuanian woman living in one of the
suburbs took her three children and came to
Chicago to her sisters, because her husband
abused her, called her vile names, and beat her.
When the husband was interviewed he agreed not
to do so again, and his family returned to him.

Of course, the theory underlying even the
feminist "married woman's property laws" included
not only her enjoyment of rights, but her
exercise of legal responsibility; but the restrained
exercise of newly acquired freedom is evidence of
high social and personal development. And the
women in the foreign-born groups come from the
country, the village, the small town. They have
had little education, their days have been filled
with work, so that there has been little time for
reflection, they come from a simple situation in
which there was little temptation to do wrong.[52]
They find here, on the other hand, a situation
which is complex in the extreme, and in which
there are elements that tend to make matters
especially difficult for women.

Attention has already been called to the confusion
created by the lodger in the home and the
special temptation to the woman to desert her
husband for the lodger. The relative scarcity of
women in the group, the presence of large numbers
of men who cannot enter a legal marriage
relationship because they have wives in the old
country, the spiritual separation that often results
from physical separation caused by the
man's coming ahead to prepare a place&mdash;all these
are undoubtedly factors that enter in to make difficult
the wise use of her freedom. Native endowment,
moral as well as physical and mental, varies
among these women as among other women. Confronted
with this confused and difficult situation,
the change from the old sanctions, the old safeguards,
even the old legal obligations, is difficult.

It is inevitable that a few will find themselves
unequal to the task of readjusting their lives.
The father of one family came to the Immigrant's
Protective League in Chicago, asking help because
his wife had turned him out of his home.
He said that she drank and was immoral. Instead
of caring for the home and the two-year-old
child, she spent her time behind the bar in her
brother's saloon, having "a good time" with the[53]
customers. She had deserted six weeks before,
but he had found her and had had her in the
Court of Domestic Relations, where he had been
persuaded to take her back. He said she was
still drinking and still neglecting the child.
Shortly after asking the help of the league, the
father ran away, taking with him the child whom
the mother left alone in the house while she went
to the "movies."

The women who assert themselves in their
new rights are in a small minority. A young
Polish woman complains that the women of her
group are too submissive even in this country,
and "bear beatings just as their mothers did
in the old country." In the great majority of
foreign-born families, as in all families, the question
of the legal rights of the woman is never
raised. The habits and attitudes formed under
the old system of law and customs are carried
over into the life in the new country, and are
changed so gradually and imperceptibly that no
apparent friction is caused in the family group.
Moreover, in many cases where the woman perceives
her changed position she is able to make
her husband see it too, and she herself is able to
work her way through to a new understanding.
It is interesting to note that the women of the
foreign-born groups who have worked their way
through are now bending their energies toward
helping the women who have not yet started.




[54]
III

THE CARE OF THE HOUSE


The work that the housewife must do in the care
of the house is the maintenance of such standards
of cleanliness and order as are to prevail.
It includes the daily routine tasks of bedmaking,
cooking, sweeping, dusting, dishwashing, disposing
of waste, and the heavier work of washing,
ironing, and periodic cleanings.


NEW HOUSEKEEPING CONDITIONS

The foreign-born housewife finds this work particularly
difficult for many reasons. In the first
place, housekeeping in the country from which
she came was done under such different conditions
that it here becomes almost a new problem
in which her experience in the old country may
prove of little use. The extent to which this is
true varies from group to group. To understand
the problems of any particular group, careful
study should be made of the living conditions
and housekeeping practices in the country from
which it came.

Some of the women with whom we have conferred[55]
have described housekeeping as they knew
it in the old country. These descriptions are
suggestive of the character of the change and
the difficulties involved. Mrs. P., a Polish
woman from Posen, for example, said that:

Houses in the village in which she lived were made of
clay, with thatched roofs, clay floors, and about ten feet
high. They were made in rows, for four families or two
families, with one outer door opening from a hall into which
the doors from all the dwellings opened. Each dwelling
had one small window, and a fireplace. Water was out of
doors. In the four-family house there were two chimneys.
The outside door did not open into the road.



FLOOR PLAN OF HOUSES IN POLAND


The floors were covered with sand, and new sand was
put on when the room was cleaned. The fireplace had a
hook from which hung the kettle, and in one corner was
the oven, a little place set off by a board covered with clay.
Walls were whitewashed. Mrs. P. said that the housework
is much more difficult in this country, with the cleaning of
woodwork, washing windows, care of curtains, carpets, and[56]
dishes, and more elaborate cooking. In the old country
the family washing was done only once a month, except in
cases where there were small children. Then it was done
weekly; and if the family lacked sufficient clothing, the
washing had to be done oftener. There the meal was one
dish, from which the entire family ate; here there is a variety
of food and each person has his own plate and eating utensils,
so that even the dishwashing is a greater task. In
coming to this country many women do not see that the
windows need washing or that the woodwork should be
cleaned, etc.

The beds were made of boards covered with straw, not
as a straw mattress. Sheets were laid over the straw to
make it softer. Each person had two pillows, very large
and full, so that they sleep in a "half sitting" position.
Feather beds are used for warmth, and no quilts or blankets
were known in the old country.

Lithuanian women, likewise, have pointed out
that at home most of the women worked in the
fields, and that what housekeeping was done was
of the simplest kind. The peasant house consisted
of two rooms, one of which was used only
on state occasions, a visit from the priest, a
wedding, christening, or a funeral. In summer
no one sleeps in the house, but all sleep out of
doors in the hay; in winter, women with small
children sleep inside, but the others sleep in the
granary. Feather beds are, in these circumstances,
a real necessity. Thus the bed that is
found in this country is unknown in Lithuania,
and the women naturally do not know how to
care for one. They not only do not realize the
need of airing it, turning the mattress, and changing[57]
the bedding, but do not even know how to
make it up properly.

Other processes of housekeeping&mdash;dishwashing,
scrubbing, and washing&mdash;prove equally difficult,
and it is said that most of the women do things
in the hardest possible way, chiefly because the
processes are different here and they lack the
technique to do their work in the easier way.
Naturally, too, when work in the fields has occupied
most of their time, they lack also habits
of order and routine in their household tasks.

The Italian women, especially those from
southern Italy and Sicily, have also spoken of
their difficulties in housekeeping under new conditions.
In Italy the houses, even of the relatively
well-to-do peasants, were two-room affairs
with earthen floors and little furniture. The
women had little time to give to the care of the
house, and its comfort and order were not considered
important.

The experience in doing the family washing is
said to typify the change. In Italy washing is
done once a month, or at most, once a fortnight, in
the poorer families. Clothes are placed in a great
vat or tub of cold water, covered with a cloth on
which is sprinkled wood ashes, and allowed to
stand overnight. In the morning they are taken
to a stream or fountain, and washed in running
water. They are dried on trees and bushes in
the bright, Italian sunlight. Such methods of[58]
laundry work do not teach the women anything
about washing in this country, and they
are said to make difficult work of it in many
cases. They learn that clothes are boiled here,
but they do not know which clothes to boil and
which to wash without boiling; and as a result
they often boil all sorts of clothing, colored and
white, together. In Italy washing is a social
function; here it is a task for each individual
woman.


DEMANDS OF AMERICAN COOKERY

Cooking in this country varies in difficulty in the
different national groups. In the case of the
Lithuanians and Poles, for example, the old-country
cooking is simple and easily done.
Among others it is a fine art, requiring much
time and skill. The Italian cooking, of course, is
well known, as is also the Hungarian. Among
the Bohemians and Croatians, too, the housewives
are proverbially good cooks and spend
long hours over the preparation of food. Croatian
women in this country are said to regard
American cookery with scorn. They say that
Croatian women do not expect to get a meal in
less than two or three hours, while here all the
emphasis is on foods that can be prepared in
twenty or thirty minutes.

It is not always easy to transplant this art of
cookery, even if the women had time to practice[59]
it here as they did at home. The materials can
usually be obtained, although often at a considerable
expense, but the equipment with which
they cook and the stoves on which they cook
are entirely different. The Italian women, for
example, cannot bake their bread in the ovens of
the stoves that they use here. Tomato paste,
for example, is used in great quantities by Italian
families, and is made at home by drying the
tomatoes in the open air. When an attempt is
made to do this in almost any large city the
tomatoes get not only the sunshine, but the soot
and dirt of the city. The more particular Italians
here will not make tomato paste outdoors, but
large numbers of Italian families continue to
make it, as can be seen by a walk through
any Italian district in late August or early
September.

In general, in the groups in which cooking was
highly developed, a great deal of time was devoted
to the preparation of food. If the housewife
wishes to reduce her work in this country,
she finds that some of the ingredients which make
our cooking simpler are unknown to her. The
Bohemians, for example, do not know how to
use baking powder, and the same is true of the
women in Lithuanian, Polish, and Russian groups,
where the art of cooking is less developed.

With this lack of experience in housekeeping
under comparable conditions, the foreign-born[60]
housewife finds the transition to housekeeping in
this country difficult at best. As a matter of
fact, however, the circumstances under which
she must make the change are often of the worst.
She is expected to maintain standards of cleanliness
and sanitary housekeeping that have developed
with modern systems of plumbing and
facilities for the disposal of waste that are not
always to be found in the districts in which she
lives. Even a skillful housewife finds housekeeping
difficult in such houses as are usually
occupied by recently arrived immigrants.


WATER SUPPLY ESSENTIAL

In the first place, there is the question of water
supply. Cleanliness of house, clothing, and even
of person is extremely difficult in a modern industrial
community, without an adequate supply
of hot and cold water within the dwelling. We
are, however, very far from realizing this condition.
In some cities[13] the law requires that
there shall be a sink with running water in
every dwelling, but in other cities even this
minimum is not required. The United States
Immigration Commission, for example, found
that 1,413 households out of 8,651 foreign-born
households studied in seven large cities, shared
their water supply with other families. Conditions
[61]
have improved in this respect during the
last decade, but it is a great handicap to efficient
housekeeping if water has to be carried
any distance. Further inconvenience results
if running hot water is not available, which
is too often the case in the homes of the foreign
born.



THIS PUMP SUPPLIES WATER TO FOUR FAMILIES


Cleanliness is also dependent, in part, upon
the facilities for the disposition of human waste,
the convenient and accessible toilet connected
with a sewer system. These facilities are lacking
in many immigrant neighborhoods, as has been
repeatedly shown in various housing investigations.
For example, in a Slovak district in the
Twentieth Ward, Chicago, 80 per cent of the
families were using toilets located in the cellar,
yard, or under the sidewalk, and in many cases
sharing such toilets with other families. One
yard toilet was used by five families, consisting
of twenty-eight persons.[14] The danger to health,
and the lack of privacy, that such toilet accommodations
mean have been often emphasized.
In addition, it enormously increases the work of
the housewife and makes cleanliness difficult, if
not impossible.

There is also the question of heating and lighting
the house. Whenever light is provided by
the oil lamp, it must be filled and cleaned; and
[62]when heat is provided by the coal stove, it means
that the housewife must keep the fires going and
dispose of the inevitable dirt and ashes. In the
old country the provision of fuel was part of the
woman's duties; and in this country, as coal is
so expensive, many women feel they must continue
this function. Here this means picking up
fuel wherever it can be found&mdash;in dump heaps
and along the railroad tracks. A leading Bohemian
politician said that he often thought, as he
saw women prominent in Bohemian society,
"Well, times have changed since you used to
pick up coal along the railroad tracks."


OVERCROWDING HAMPERS THE HOUSEWIFE

The influence of overcrowding on the work of
the housewife must also be considered in connection
with housekeeping in immigrant households.
That overcrowding exists has been
pointed out again and again. Ordinances have
been framed to try to prevent it, but it has persisted.
In the studies of Chicago housing a large
percentage of the bedrooms have always been
found illegally occupied. The per cent of the
rooms so occupied varied from 30 in one Italian
district to 72 in the Slavic district around the
steel mills. The United States Immigration
Commission found, for example, that 5,305, or
35.1 per cent, of the families studied in industrial
centers used all rooms but one for[63]
sleeping, and another 771 families used even the
kitchen.

Crowding means denial of opportunity for
skillful and artistic performance of tasks. "A
place for everything and everything in its place,"
suggests appropriate assignment of articles of
use to their proper niches, corners, and shelves.
One room for everything except sleeping&mdash;cooking,
washing, caring for the children, catching a
breath for the moment&mdash;means no repose, no
calm, no opportunity for planning that order
which is the law of the well-governed home.
Yet there is abundant evidence that many families
have had to live in just such conditions.

The housework for the foreign-born housewife
is often complicated by other factors. One is
the practice to which reference has been already
made of taking lodgers to supplement the father's
wages. In discussing this subject from the point
of view of the lodger, it has been pointed out
that the practice with reference to the taking of
boarders and lodgers varies in different places
and among different groups. The amounts paid
were not noted there, but they become important
when considered together with the service
asked of the housewife. Usually the boarder
or lodger pays a fixed monthly sum&mdash;from $2
to $3.50, or, more rarely, $4 a month&mdash;for
lodging, cleaning, washing, and cooking; his
food is secured separately, the account being[64]
entered in a grocery book and settled at regular
intervals.

Sometimes the lodger does his own buying,
but the more common custom is to have the
housewife do it. Occasionally he does his own
cooking, in which case payment for lodging
secures him the right to use the stove. More
rarely, as in some of the Mexican families visited
in Chicago in 1919, he is a regular boarder, paying
a weekly sum for room and board.

Just what keeping lodgers means in adding to
the duties of the housewife can be seen from the
following description of the work of the Serbo-Croatian
women in Johnstown, Pennsylvania:[15]

The wife, without extra charge, makes up the beds, does
the washing and ironing, and buys and prepares the food
for all the lodgers. Usually she gets everything on credit,
and the lodgers pay their respective shares biweekly. These
conditions exist to some extent among other foreigners, but
are not so prevalent among other nationalities in Johnstown
as among the Serbo-Croatians.

In a workingman's family, it is sometimes said, the
woman's working day is two hours longer than the man's.
But if this statement is correct in general, the augmentation
stated is insufficient in these abnormal homes, where the
women are required to have many meals and dinner buckets
ready at irregular hours to accommodate men working on
different shifts.

The Serbo-Croatian women who, more than any of the
others, do all this work, are big, handsome, and graceful,
proud and reckless of their strength. During the progress[65]
of the investigation, in the winter months, they were
frequently seen walking about the yards and courts,
in bare feet, on the snow and ice-covered ground, hanging
up clothes or carrying water into the house from a
yard hydrant.


WOMEN WORK OUTSIDE THE HOME

Another factor that renders housekeeping difficult
is the necessity of doing wage-paid work
outside the home, to which reference has already
been made. Women interviewed have repeatedly
emphasized the difficulties that this practice
creates in connection with the housekeeping.

A recent study of children of working mothers,
soon to be published by the United States Children's
Bureau, carried on at the Chicago School
of Civics and Philanthropy, obtained the testimony
of the mothers as to the difficulties involved.
This study showed that in many cases
the household duties could not be performed at
the proper time; 60 women, for example, of the
109 reporting on this question, said that they
did not make their beds until night; 105 said
their dishes were not washed after each meal,
but in 41 cases were washed in the mornings,
and in 56 not until night. Three washed them
in the morning if they had time, and five left
them for the children, after school.

Many women who worked outside the home
did their housekeeping without assistance from
other members of the family. This meant that[66]
they had to get up early in the morning and frequently
work late at night at laundry or cleaning;
49 women, for example, washed in the evening;
25 washed either Saturday, Sunday, or evenings.


HOUSING IMPROVEMENT

Enough has probably been said to show that the
work of caring for the house under the conditions
existing in most immigrant neighborhoods, is unnecessarily
difficult for the foreign-born housewife.
The most obvious point at which these
burdens might be lightened so that the housewife
could have time for other duties, would appear
to be through improvement of housing.
With an awakened realization of this fact, both
on the part of the foreign-born woman herself
and the community of which she is an inevitable
part, will come the solution of these difficulties.
A protest, however inarticulate or indirectly expressed
by her, will find its response in a growing
realization that plans for improvement must be
developed.

The several housing projects that have already
been offered are suggestive of the problems and
possibilities along this line rather than useful as
hard-and-fast solutions. They not only meet
the needs of the more inadequate immigrant
housing conditions, but provide improvement
upon most native-born conditions. In this connection
interest naturally centers on the war-time[67]
housing projects of the United States government,
on the experiment of the Massachusetts
Homestead Commission at Lowell, and on certain
enterprises carried out by so-called limited
dividend companies. The first two are especially
interesting, in that they recognize that supplying
houses to the workers is not a function that
can be wholly left to private initiative.

It is not possible to discuss these projects in
detail, nor is it necessary.[16] It is sufficient to
consider them here with reference to the contributions
they might make in helping the immigrant
housewife. In the first place, they provide
for a toilet and a bath in every house, and a
supply of running water that is both adequate
and convenient. In the matter of kitchen equipment
there is an attempt to provide some of the
conveniences. Both provide a sink and set wash-tubs
equipped with covers. They must be set at
a minimum of thirty-six inches from the floor in
the United States plans. Both make provision
for gas to be used for cooking, although the coal
stove is accepted. The kitchens in the Massachusetts
houses are also provided with kitchen
cabinets, with shelves under the sink, and with
a drain for the refrigerator.

In other ways also consideration for the housewife
[68]is evidenced. Electricity is urged for lighting,
passages through which furniture would not
go are avoided, the size of the living room is
adapted to the sizes of the most commonly purchased
rugs, etc. Study of the Massachusetts
plans reveals other interesting features, such as
the care given to the location of the bathroom
and the attention to the size of the doors, so that
the mother at work in her kitchen can watch the
children at play in other rooms.

Both projects are interesting also in that they
realize the necessity of a "front room" or parlor,
and prescribe a minimum number of bedrooms&mdash;three
in the Massachusetts, and two in the
United States experiment. Both require closets
in every bedroom wide enough to receive the
men's garments on hangers, and rooms of such
size that the bed can stand free of the wall and
out of a draught. It is evident that the plans
for houses in both projects provide very definite
improvements in the matter of the conveniences
to which the immigrant is not accustomed in the
houses at present available to him.

Some limitations, however, become apparent
by comparing them with the recommendations
of the Women's Subcommittee of the Ministry of
Reconstruction Advisory Council, England. That
committee emphasizes the importance of electricity
for lighting, and urges "that a cheap supply
of electricity for domestic purposes should[69]
be made available with the least possible delay."
The American plans agree that electricity is the
preferred lighting, but gas is accepted by the
United States government, although not by the
Massachusetts plan. There is no suggestion of
developing a cheaper supply of electricity.

The English women also suggest the desirability
of a central heating plant as a measure
that would lessen the work of the household,
afford economies in fuel, and render a hot-water
supply readily available. They urge, therefore,
further experimentation with central heating.
The American plans have no suggestions to
make at this point, but accept the coal stove or
the separate furnace in the higher-priced houses
as the means of heating. While they provide for
hot water, no suggestions are made as to how
this is to be supplied. It is presumably done by
a tank attached to the range, which means that
hot water is not available when there is no fire
in the range; that is, in summer and during the
night. It should also be noted that these plans
make no suggestions for co-operative use of any
of the equipment of the household.

There is another point at which the architects
and builders failed to take sufficient notice of
the problem of lightening the women's work&mdash;namely,
in their attitude toward the separate
family home as compared with the multiple family
dwelling. The Massachusetts Commission[70]
was, by the terms of the Act creating it, limited
to the provision of one or two-family houses;
the United States government standards were
definitely against the building occupied in whole
or in part by three or more families.

Tenement and apartment houses are considered generally
undesirable, and will be accepted only in cities where, because
of high land values, it is clearly demonstrated that
single and two-family houses cannot be economically provided,
or where there is insistent demand for this type of
multiple housing.

This judgment, however, has by no means
met with universal approval. Those architects
who think in terms of the woman's time and
strength consider the merits of the group and
of the multiple house. For example, those who
planned the Black Rock Apartment House Group
in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the open-stairway
dwellings, the John Jay dwellings on East Seventy-seventh
Street, New York City, and the
Erwin, Tennessee, development, maintain that
the advantages of the separate house in privacy,
independence, and access to land can be secured
by the multiple arrangement. Not only can economies
in the use of the land be practiced, but
protection and assistance for the women and
children can be obtained, and there is the possibility
of devices for convenient and collective
performance of many tasks.

It is unnecessary to review the arguments for[71]
the one or for the other. It is evident that the
group house, and perhaps the multiple house, offer
such inducements in the economy of space and
the possibility of assigning areas of land to
definite and anticipated uses, that their further
adaptation to family needs must be contemplated.
It is generally assumed that the family group
wants the separate house. The question of interest
for this study is one of the desire of the
immigrant groups in this respect. Their preference
should be an indispensable element in the
formulation of housing standards.

There is not, however, a great deal of evidence
on this subject. The fact that immigrants
live in the city in the congested districts
may only indicate that they have had no choice
in the matter. Most of the officers of certain
immigrant building and loan associations interviewed
for this study thought there was a preference
for the single-family dwelling when
it could be afforded. That also is the belief
of the investigators in this study, who think
that the use of multiple houses indicates
not the immigrants' desires, but their acceptance
of what is before them, and that the dream
of almost every immigrant family is to have a
house of its own, to which is attached a little
garden.

How far the desire for the separate house is
confused with the desire for the garden would[72]
be difficult to say. It is certain, however, that
in general the immigrant has known only one
way to have the garden, and that was by having
a separate house. There is universal agreement
that especially the foreign-born family desires
access to land for whose cultivation they may be
responsible, and whose produce both in food and
in flowers they may enjoy. Recently, however,
certain architects have been interested in working
out plans by which this advantage might be retained
for dwellers in group or tenement houses.
They have pointed out that one advantage of
the group and multiple house is the setting free
of spaces to be more skillfully adapted to the
size and composition of the family.

Attention may be called to certain devices
that are urged by experienced architects in the
matter of the use of land. For example, in the
Morgan Park, Minnesota, development of the
Illinois Steel Company, the architects have developed
interesting plans in connection with their
low-cost houses. These are all group houses,
with a front space opening on an attractively
planned street. At the rear of the house is a
latticed porch&mdash;a small area graveled, but not
grassed&mdash;and then the alley. Across the alley is
the rear garden, which may thus be fenced in
and kept separate from the house lot.
[73]



A COMMUNITY PLAN SUBMITTED BY MILO HASTINGS IN THE
AMERICAN HOUSING COMPETITION, 1919, SHOWING THE U VARIATIONS,
THE BACK SERVICE STREET, THE PROVISION FOR
REAR GARDENS, AND THE OPEN AREAS ON WHICH ALL THE
HOUSES WILL FRONT

(Reprinted by permission from the Journal of the American Institute
of Architects, June, 1919)


Interesting suggestions on this point are to be
found in the two articles, to which prizes were[74]
given by the American Institute of Architects in
the June and July, 1919, numbers of their journal.
There is much experimentation yet to be done,
as the question of the separate house with its
separate plot of ground is by no means a settled
one. It is particularly desirable that the interest
of the foreign born be enlisted, both that they
may contribute to the solution of the question
and that they may become acquainted with all
the possibilities of access to the land which are
being worked out.

In spite of some defects and the need for
further experimentation along the lines suggested
above, there is no doubt that the projects of
Massachusetts and of the Federal government
mark a very real advance. The most pressing
need is to construct a sufficient number of these
houses so that they may be available for immigrant
groups. One means of doing this is by the
employer's building houses for the workers to
buy or to rent. Although this has sometimes
been found to help solve the housing situation,
factors may enter that limit its usefulness. The
industrial relationships between employer and
employee may be such that subsidy for housing
by employer would hinder rather than help.
Where a community is largely comprised of one
industry it may be very unwise for the industry
to go so far toward the control of community
affairs. Labor unrest in the northern iron ranges[75]
can be traced in part to such company provision
of housing and sanitation.

The limited dividend company, organized not
for profit, and operating under the careful supervision
of a governmental department, is another
solution. This agency has been particularly successful
in Massachusetts under the stimulus as
well as under the supervision of the Massachusetts
Homestead Commission, and is undoubtedly
capable of further development.


GOVERNMENT BUILDING LOANS

Another possibility is that the local or state
government advance the money and enable the
worker to buy his own home. That is the plan
adopted by the Massachusetts Homestead Commission
in its experiment at Lowell. It is also
one of the policies adopted by the Canadian
government, which will loan money to provincial
governments to be advanced for building
houses on land owned (a) by the provincial or
municipal government, (b) by the limited dividend
company, (c) by the workman himself.
This latter plan would probably commend itself
most readily to the foreign-speaking groups.

Direct loans by the local government to the
worker are advocated in the careful and thorough
plan worked out by Mrs. E. E. Wood.[17] One suggestion
[76]is a proposed amendment to the Postal
Savings Law, authorizing loans from postal savings
deposits to workers with annual incomes not
in excess of twelve hundred dollars. The investigation
of the application is to be in the hands of
the nearest local housing board. A suggested
amendment to the Farm Loan Act is that housing
loans be made by the Farm Loan Board on the
same terms on which farm loans are now authorized.
It is interesting to note that this plan
contemplates the continued activity of the building
and loan associations with which the foreign
born are already familiar. It suggests that the
first loan be given by the government and the
association be content with a second mortgage,
receiving in return the greater stability that is
secured from a transaction carried on under governmental
supervision.

According to Mrs. Wood's report, before 1915,
700,000 houses had been built or acquired in the
United States through the aid of building and
loan associations.[18] She thinks that the moderately
paid wage earner, but not the unskilled
worker, was benefited. This conclusion is disputed
by officers of four building and loan associations
in Chicago interviewed in connection
with this study. That the associations reach the
foreign-speaking groups seems to be evident from
[77]the names in the Annual Report of the auditor
of the state of Illinois for 1918. The Bohemians
had the largest number of societies, and the Poles
were second. The Italians alone of the large
national groups were unrepresented.

Mrs. Wood's plan also calls for a national
housing commission in the Department of Labor,
to be created under congressional act, with organization
and powers analogous to those exercised
by the Federal Board for Vocational Education.
For the use of this commission it is proposed
that a fund be created by the issue of
bonds, from which loans could be made to certain
designated agencies for the clearance of congested
areas and the increase of housing facilities.

The Federal legislation is to be supplemented
according to Mrs. Wood's plan by state legislation,
including:

1. A restrictive housing law, a constructive
housing law, and a Town Planning Act. This
plan contemplates a state commission on housing
and town planning through which the Federal
aid for the state would be made available; to
which should be intrusted the responsibility of
investigating and approving or disapproving
housing schemes proposed by local agencies and
associations.

2. A state fund similar to the Federal fund is
proposed, and definite suggestions for its use are
worked out. For the local authorities, local housing[78]
and town-planning boards, probably with
the county as the basis of organization, are
proposed.

This housing fund, composed of the Federal
fund, the state fund, and in some cases local
funds, is to be used to make loans to municipalities,
housing organizations that are not organized
for profit, limited dividend companies, co-operative
associations, or even employers. The
plan contemplates that the lowest paid wage
earners, among whom are numbered a large per
cent of the foreign born, should continue to rent;
but the landlord should not be a private individual
seeking to make profit from providing the
workers with shelter.

The plan also takes note of the plan for co-partnership
ownership adopted by the United
States Housing Corporation. The main features
of this arrangement are:

1. Ownership vested in a local board of trustees
bound to operate the property in the interest
of the tenants and until the property is fully
amortized in the interest of the government.

2. Formation of a tenants' association to which
all residents of three months are eligible on payment
of small yearly dues. This association to
elect a tenants' council to act as directors of the
association, to confer with the board of trustees,
and to carry out such duties as trustees direct.

3. Any tenant may become a co-partner by[79]
applying for bonds to the amount of 25 per cent
of the value of his dwelling, and accompanying
his application with a cash subscription of one
half per cent of this.

4. Tenant co-partners are given a voice in the
management by the right to elect trustees, the
number increasing with the amount of subscriptions
to bonds.

5. Tenant co-partners granted remission of one
month's rent a year.

6. Tenant co-partners leaving or desiring to
discontinue as co-partners have the right to sell
their bonds to trustees at par.

Mr. A. C. Comey, the author of the plan, says
of it:[19]

Such a co-partnership scheme as this will present to workmen
a unique opportunity for saving, for not only will they
get as high a rate of interest as a safe investment justifies,
but they will be to a large degree custodians of their own
security and will thus be able to protect their investments
in much the same way as actual home owners. On the
other hand they will avoid most of the pitfalls of home
owning, such as loss through deterioration of a neighborhood,
forced sales in case of departure, and inability to
realize on assets locked up in private homes. Moreover,
they will tend to develop a high degree of community spirit,
usually so lacking among apartment dwellers, and thus take
more interest in public affairs and become better citizens
generally.

These are advantages which it would be especially
desirable for the foreign-born groups, as
[80]many of them have experienced the pitfalls of
home ownership. It is a complicated system
and would have to be explained in detail to the
various groups. The medium for such explanations
is at hand in the foreign-language press and
in the immigrant societies, and the effort that it
would involve is surely worth making. It should
also be noted that it is not so complicated a system
as the land tenure in many of the countries
from which the immigrants come.


INSTRUCTION IN SANITATION

The subject of housing reform as a means of
easing the housewife's task was considered first,
as it is useless to talk of helping her in her work
until she is given some of the conveniences with
which to work. It is evident, however, that that
is not all that is necessary for the foreign-born
housewife. She is not accustomed to the use of
a house of the size contemplated by the proposed
plans&mdash;the Italians, Lithuanians, Poles, Russians,
Hungarians, and doubtless others have known
only the one and two-room house&mdash;and there is
always the possibility that, given more rooms,
they may be used to take in more lodgers. Such
was the case, for example, in the relatively adequate
houses provided by the United States Steel
Corporation at Gary.

It is not necessary, however, to use the method
of that corporation, and turn out of the houses[81]
persons who need instruction in the use of the
house. Persuasion and instruction in the uses
of the special features of the house could have
been tried. It might have been possible for the
rent collector or a sanitary inspector with a social
point of view to establish friendly relations on
their regular visits to the families. With confidence
gained and tact displayed, much in the
way of education could be accomplished. To
construct houses so that each room can serve
one and only one purpose would in part meet
the difficulties. Above all, patience and a realization
of the difficulties that the foreign-born
housewife meets, are essential.

A point on which some architects lay special
stress in the structure of low-cost houses is the
devotion of the entire first floor to cooking and
living uses&mdash;not sleeping. That is, the living
room, dining room, and kitchen are either combined
or so open into each other that no temptation
is offered to close off part for sleeping purposes.
The bedrooms are then on the second
floor, each room having only one door, and the
bathroom and the storage space are slightly elevated
above the second and offer no temptation
to be used for purposes other than those for
which they are designed. If, then, families inexperienced
in the use of modern accommodations
come into the community, they may perhaps
be helped to an understanding of modern[82]
devices by the experience of living in houses
arranged in this way.

Both the rent collector, if it be a case of tenancy,
and the building official, if it be a case of
ownership, should not only understand the principles
of sanitation and hygiene, but should
understand the people they serve. To render
the best service to immigrant groups, such officials
must speak the language of the group and
understand something of its peculiarities. They
should, in fact, be public assistant housekeepers,
through whose assistance the gradual and voluntary
initiation of our foreign-born neighbors
into community life can take place. New standards
of efficiency and new amenities can be developed.
Our community life might, then, be
freed from the old physical dangers connected
with human adjustment to physical surroundings,
and take on new dignities suitable to a
democratic and adequate life for the whole
people.

There remain the difficulties described at the
beginning of the chapter, which come from the
fact that the processes of the work of caring for
the house are different in this country from those
in the country from which the foreign-born housewives
came. These difficulties are not so easy to
solve as those of housing. They are undoubtedly
surmounted as time goes on, but it is a gradual
process. Many forces are at work. Necessity[83]
is probably the primary one. The foreign-born
woman early learns to use American cooking
utensils and fuel because they are all she can
get. She has to feed her family with the only
food the store at the corner furnishes. American
furniture and furnishings soon attract her attention,
and she is curious as to their purposes and
uses.

In part, the foreign-born housewives have
learned from one another; that is, from the members
of the group who have been here longer;
and in part they have learned by going into the
more comfortable American homes as domestic
servants. Those who have done the latter are,
usually, the girls who come alone or the elder
daughters of the family. In some communities,
such as a Bohemian community near Dallas,
Texas, it is said to be well understood that the
girl will learn domestic science by a kind of apprenticeship
in the home of her employer. When
she has learned what she thinks sufficient, she
leaves to practice in her own home and to show
her family how things should be done. The
limitations and difficulties of domestic service
for the inexperienced immigrant have been well
set forth in the reports of various protective
societies.[20] But the foreign-born women with
[84]whom we have conferred in this study have repeatedly
emphasized the advantages that come
from being shown how to do housework under
the conditions in this country. Yet women of
the "new" immigrant groups enter domestic
service much less than those from the "old"
ones.

In the end, no doubt, many foreign-born housewives
have learned to care for their homes and
raise their families as systematically as their
American neighbors, who have had fewer difficulties
to contend with. It is, however, a wasteful
system which leaves the instruction of the
immigrant housewife to the chance instruction
she can gain from fellow countrywomen who have
themselves learned only imperfectly. If the community
only realized what the difficulties were
for the housewife from a different civilization, it
would undoubtedly stretch out a friendly and
helping hand to assist her over the first rough
path. Whatever form this help takes, it must
be offered in the spirit of friendly co-operation,
and not of didactic superiority, if the desired
result is to be gained.




[85]
IV

PROBLEMS OF SAVING


There has been in the past much harsh and
thoughtless criticism of the foreign-born groups,
because of the extent to which they have seemed
able and willing to subordinate present necessities
and enjoyments to provide for certain future
contingencies.


PRESENT AND FUTURE NEEDS

Many of those who come to this country are in
debt for their passage. Others have left near
relatives at home who must be helped to come
over. Some have come, intending to establish
themselves and to be married here. Some expect
to take back a part of their earnings to better
the condition of those left behind. Their coming,
whether to stay permanently or to return,
often does not relieve them of their obligations
to the group in the old country.

One of the strongest impressions that the
reader gets from the letters in The Polish Peasant
is that of the frequency with which relatives in[86]
the old country ask for money from the one who
has gone ahead. It is not only his wife and
children, or aged parents, that ask for money,
but all the members of the wider familial group,
and sometimes even friends with no claim on
the score of kinship.

The purposes for which they ask money are
various; in the Borek series, for example, a son
of the family is asked to send money because the
family is in debt and has taxes to pay; to send
money for the dowry of his sister; for a forge; for
a sewing machine, and for a phonograph. He is
also told that if he sends money home it will not
be wasted, but will be put out at interest. Other
claims for money are put forward in other series,
possibly the most common one being a request
for a steamship ticket. The letters show clearly
that it is customary to send money for fête days,
"name days," or birthdays, Christmas, Easter,
and other occasions. A failure to do so brings
reproach coupled with a reminder that others
who had gone from the village had sent money.
In the Wrobelski series the family ask money
from the member in this country for a new
church at home. Every Sunday the priest
reads aloud the names of those who have contributed.
It therefore seems to the immigrant
imperative that from his present earnings certain
amounts shall be set aside.

When the first hard times are past and the[87]
members of the immediate family are reunited,
there comes the reaction to the experience of
depending on the money wage. There arises the
fear of disaster growing out of interruption of the
income, or misfortune involving especially heavy
expenditure.

The United States Treasury Department in
its "Thrift" campaign lays down the doctrine
save first and spend afterward.[21] This is what the
members of the foreign-born groups have long
been doing, and probably this policy is the only
possible basis for a rational use of one's resources.
Yet doing this gives rise to comment on the "low
standard of life." And thrift often seems to border
on miserliness.

Indeed, the problem is by no means so simple
as the use of the categorical imperative would
indicate. The whole question of deciding between
the claims of the present and of the future
is a very difficult one. The economist gives us
little definite help. He lays down the so-called
"rule of uses" and tells the housewife so to apply
her resources that the utility extracted from any
unit may be at least as great as if that unit were
applied elsewhere. Now the foreign-born housewife,
like other housewives, has certain resources
of money and time and strength, and these she
wishes to distribute wisely. But she labors under
[88]many disadvantages, of which it is only fair to
take notice.


UNFAMILIARITY WITH MONEY

In the first place, her income is in an unfamiliar
form. There is first the fact that the money
units are strange to her. A woman who recently
came over, being called on to make an unexpected
payment, handed her purse to a fellow
traveler, asking that the required amount be
taken out. In the second place, for many there
is the difficulty growing out of the exclusive dependence
upon money payments, when before
there were both money and the products of the
land.

The fact should always be kept in mind that,
to the extent to which the foreign born are from
rural districts, they have the difficulty experienced
by all who are forced to adjust themselves
to an economy built on money, as distinguished
from an economy built on kind.
In the country where things are grown, there
is little opportunity for acquiring a sense of
money values.

It is then peculiarly difficult to value in terms
of the new measure those articles with which one
has been especially familiar under the old economy.
For example, when vegetables and fruits
have been enjoyed without estimating their value,
it is difficult to judge their value in money. While[89]
meat was before thought out of reach, it may be
purchased at exorbitant rates under the new circumstances,
because one has no idea of how much
it should cost. Evidence as to this kind of difficulty
is found among all groups. It takes the
form, sometimes, of apparent parsimony, sometimes
of reckless and wasteful buying.

The Lithuanians seem, for example, to experience
difficulties of this kind everywhere. The
small farmer in Lithuania was accustomed to an
irregular cash income at harvest time. Sometimes
it carried over from one year to another,
while young stock was growing. He had little
need of money except for extraordinary expenses,
such as those for farm machinery, or building.
The local store, which was usually co-operative,
carried only such imported articles as salt, sugar,
spices, tea, and coffee. All other foods were
produced at home or secured through neighborly
exchange. All the clothing for the family was
of home manufacture, even to the cloth. If
a boy were sent to school in the nearest large
town, his board was paid with poultry and dairy
products.

The tenant laborer had house rent free, a
garden, a cow, a few pigs, and all the poultry he
cared to raise, in addition to the yearly wage of
from 125 to 150 rubles a year.

Other farm laborers had board and clothing in
addition to their wage of 25 rubles a year. Women[90]
received 3 rubles a year for farm labor, in addition
to board and all ordinary clothing. The
food provided by the farmers was coarse and
monotonous, but it was plentiful and nourishing.
Laborers were housed in two-room log or board
houses, with thatched roofs; farm workers without
families slept in the farmer's granaries and
ate at a common table.

To the inexperienced peasant the daily wage
of $1.50 and $2 in the United States seemed
ample, but it was not long after the family arrived
before it was found inadequate. The situation
becomes still more confusing if employment
is seasonal and irregular. In Lithuania, contracts
were made by the year and unemployment was
unknown. Through apprehension they begin to
adopt a low standard of living in order to economize,
a practice now common in many Lithuanian
communities in this country. They
have never paid rent in their native country,
so one of their first instincts is to economize
at that point in the new country by taking
lodgers.

Among other national groups there are evidences
of the same difficulties. Bohemian women,
it is said, buy recklessly at first, spending money
for jewelry and all sorts of things they see for
sale in the neighborhood stores. Ukrainian
women control the expenditure of the family
income here, but in the village life in Galicia[91]
they never had much money to spend; the table
was supplied from the farm, clothing was of home
manufacture, furniture was seldom bought. They
are, therefore, when they first come, little fitted
by previous experience for wise expenditure of
the family income.


IRREGULARITY OF INCOME

To these difficulties are added those connected
with the uncertainty and irregularity of wage
payments and with the length of intervals recurring
between these payments. The ways in
which periods of unemployment and consequent
cessation of income are met are illustrated by
the following experiences described by those with
whom we have conferred.

The story of how the mother or children have
gone out to work, of how boarders have been
taken into the home, savings have been spent,
money has been borrowed from friends, or charity
has been accepted, occurs over and over in the
experience of all the national groups. A Ukrainian
mother tells how she and the older children
at various times have worked during the father's
unemployment. A few years ago, when it lasted
for two years, she was no longer strong enough
to work, and they sold their home in order to
keep the children in school.

Another Ukrainian family has of late depended
upon the earnings of the children and savings,[92]
but there have been times when they had nothing
in the house but water, and could not buy
food. A Polish mother borrowed money of the
Jewish grocer when her savings were gone and
her earnings insufficient. One Bohemian family
had to draw on their savings in the building and
loan association during a year of unemployment.


RESERVES FOR MISFORTUNES

It is easy, then, to understand how out of the
most meager present income some provision for
possible disasters will be attempted. The urgency
of this claim of the future explains the fact that
the possession of a balance at the end of the year
constitutes no evidence that the income for the
year has either been adequate or been regarded
as adequate. The social investigator has found
savings taken from the most inadequate incomes;
and judgment has been sometimes passed on
the "low standard of life" of the immigrant,
when a moment's sympathetic consideration
of the problem would have discovered the explanation
in the ever-present fear of being caught
unprepared.

The occasions for which this provision is made
are, to be sure, not all of the nature of an unexpected
disaster; they are, often, the ordinary
events of life. There is, first, the constant possibility
of sickness and of death. After the establishment
of the family group, these perhaps make[93]
the first claim on the family's savings. The fear
of these events may be so great that even the
well-being of the children in the present may be
sacrificed. For example, a Polish widow with
two children, who was being supported by the
United Charities in Chicago, was found to have
a bank account of $192.57 which she had saved
from her allowance of $3 a week in addition
to her rent. When the visitor talked with her
about it, she explained that she was afraid of
dying and leaving her children unprovided for,
and that her husband had always told her to
put away part of her income.

While the need for providing for dependents
is thus felt, most wage earners realize that they
cannot during their own lifetime lay aside enough
money to provide for their children. The most
that they can do is to provide some life insurance.
Even this, in most cases, must be entirely
inadequate, since the premiums mean a great
drain on the family's resources.

In a study of 3,048 families in Chicago, the
Illinois Health Insurance Commission found that
81.9 per cent of all the families carried some kind
of life insurance. The average amount of the
policy, however, was only $419.24. The following
table shows for the various nationalities in
the group the per cent carrying insurance and
the average amount of the policy.[22]

It is interesting to note that the Bohemians are
among the national groups showing the largest
per cent (88.9) of families having life-insurance
policies. They also show the largest average
policy ($577.58) of any national groups, including
the native-born white.

The method by which this particular provision
is made is often through the fraternal order, the
benefit society, and the form of commercial insurance
known as industrial insurance. The fraternal
orders that are used by foreign-born groups
are usually societies of their own national group,
such as the Polish National Alliance, the Croatian
League of Illinois, the Lithuanian National Alliance.[95]
They differ from the benefit societies,
such as the Czecho-Slav Workingman, the Znanie
Russian Club, and the Congrega di Maria Virgine
del Monte Carmelo, in that the fraternal orders
are organized under the state laws governing
fraternal insurance societies, are incorporated,
and usually have a more than local membership.
Most of the benefit societies are small local societies
without national affiliation, often not observing
good insurance principles and without
the needed succession of young lives.

These types of insurance were made the subject
of special study by the Illinois Health Insurance
Commission of 1919. The judgment of
the Health Commission as to the value of these
organizations is, that the fraternal societies, although
they are democratic, co-operative, and
nonprofit-seeking organizations, thus being particularly
attractive to wage earners, are often
not on an actuarially sound basis.[23] The benefit
societies of the foreign born present an even more
precarious means of providing for future needs.[24]
Sooner or later they find that the dues must be
increased, their membership declines, and the
period of decay sets in.

Industrial insurance provides a safer method
than either of these, but it presents a number of
other disadvantages.[25] The policies are usually
[96]small, sufficient only for burial expenses, and the
rates are relatively high because of the bad risk
among the wage earners, and especially because
of the expense of weekly collections. Here, as
everywhere, the poor who must buy in small
quantities get relatively less for what they
pay.

It is often urged against industrial insurance
that it makes no real provision for dependents,
and merely pays for a somewhat elaborate funeral.
It must be borne in mind that the funeral,
however modest, is an expense that often places
the family in debt, and that even the thriftless
will try to make some provision for it. The following
expense account of the funeral of a Polish
man is typical of the accounts received during
this inquiry, and exhibits no unusual expenditure
when compared with American customs:




Embalming$ 11.00
Casket65.00
Crape and gloves2.50
Candles3.00
Hearse11.00
Carriage9.00
Grave12.00
Outside box6.00
Total$119.50


It is a matter of common knowledge that unscrupulous
undertakers often obtain possession
of the insurance policy and make the charge for[97]
the funeral equal to the whole amount. This
may, in part, explain the criticism that the funerals
in foreign-born families are often unnecessarily
expensive. An Italian woman interviewed,
the president of one benefit society and a member
of four others, speaks of going to buy a casket at
the time of the death of a friend during the influenza
epidemic. The cheap, wooden casket
cost $150. The next day, when she went with
another friend to the same undertaker, the
casket which had been $150 cost $175. She
could not understand how such prices could
be allowed, and exclaimed, "The government
regulates prices of flour and sugar, and why
not such things as the cost of coffins in times
like these!"

There may also be expenses connected with the
service itself. In some churches the tolling of
the bells must be paid for by the mourners, and
sometimes it is the poorest who will insist that
the bells be tolled the longest. In a church in
South Chicago it is said that the parishioners
paid for the chimes with the definite understanding
that the bell-tolling at funerals should no
longer be a special charge. The need of provision
against sickness and death is keenly felt in every
immigrant community. One of the older women,
who had been frequently called into the homes in
cases of sickness and death, said that in sickness
there was never money for the doctor, or night[98]
clothes, or bedding, and in case of death never
enough of anything.


THE COST OF WEDDINGS

After providing for sickness and death, a family
must lay aside the sum necessary to secure an
advantageous marriage for the daughter, and to
meet her family's share of the wedding. Similarly,
the young man anticipates marriage as a
natural development in his life. It is interesting
to consider the share of the cost borne by the
girl's family and that borne by the young man,
and to notice also certain customs connected
with the wedding itself that contribute toward
the expense.

The customs connected with weddings which
have grown up in the old country may, when
transplanted, mean an expense which seems entirely
out of proportion to the family's economic
status, especially when American customs are
added to those of the native country. An Italian
woman says that weddings were, as a rule, much
simpler in Italy than in the United States. There
a maid of honor and "other frills," such as automobiles,
flowers, and jewelry, were unknown. A
large feast, usually of two days' duration, was
customary, and is continued here, even in a city.
A hall must be rented for the dance, and when
food prices are high the cost is enormous.

To avoid the expense of renting a hall which[99]
would cost $100 for six hours, a recent Italian
wedding reception in Chicago was held in the
butcher shop owned by a cousin of the bridegroom.
The living rooms in the rear were used
for the dinner, and the shop itself became the
ballroom. The floor was crowded, and the children
had to be turned out into the street to play,
but the enjoyment of the party was evidently
not at all lessened by the somewhat incongruous
surroundings. The fact that there is near by not
only a great settlement where a comfortable hall
might have been available, but likewise a park
house similarly equipped, is perhaps indicative
of a failure of these institutions to meet the very
needs of the neighborhood they are designed to
serve.

It is an Italian custom for the father of the
bride and the father of the bridegroom to share
the expense of the feast, although the bridegroom
sometimes pays for the music and the hall, and
the bride's family furnish the food. An Italian
pastry dealer says that the amount spent for
pastries varies from $15 to $120, and an equal
amount is spent in home baking. For well-to-do
families the expenditures may be much larger;
for example, one family recently spent $200 for
pastry alone.

There is, however, a feature of the wedding
feast which reduces the cost to the family. It
is customary, when the party is assembled after[100]
the wedding, for the bride to be placed on a
"throne," and the guests place their presents of
money in her lap. Money is usually given, although
useful articles for the home are sometimes
included. The greater the number of
guests invited perhaps the lower the net cost of
the ceremony.

The other principal expense of the Italian
bride's family is for the bridal linen and the girl's
underwear. These, of course, vary with the circumstances
of the family. These articles are
usually the accumulation of several years.

The bridegroom pays the other costs. He buys
not only the household furniture and his clothing,
but the wedding ring, earrings, a gift for the
bride, and some of her clothing. If the girl is
poor he may even buy her underwear and the
linens. It is said that these things often cost all
the bridegroom's savings, and that the couple
start married life with nothing saved for emergencies.
The expense of the bridegroom in a
recent Italian wedding in Chicago was $2,000.

It is the custom for the man to buy for the
bride a complete costume for two days&mdash;the wedding
day and the eighth day&mdash;when the newly
married couple return the calls of the wedding
guests. An Italian saleslady in a store in the
Italian district says that the amount usually
spent on the bride's clothes is $200 or $250. The
very least spent in these days is $100, and the[101]
outfit may cost as much as $500. When the
family is a recently arrived one, the man usually
accompanies the girl or her mother to the store
and pays the bills on the spot.

Among other groups as well as among the
Italians it seems to be customary for the bridegroom
to bear part of the expense of the wedding
and of the bride's outfit. The Polish bridegroom
often gives $50 to the bride, and she buys her
clothes, linens, and the food for the feast. The
Russian girl gives a white handkerchief to the
groom, and he pays for her dress.

Another item in the expenses of a wedding is
the cost of photographs. It is the custom in
most foreign-born groups to have large photographs,
not only of the bride and groom, but of
the whole wedding party. The Polish people also
have another picture of the bridesmaid taken
with the best man. These photographs cost as
much as $30 a dozen and at a higher rate if less
than a dozen are ordered. The number ordered
depends on the economic condition of the family,
but the minimum is six of each. The pictures of
the bridal party are the largest and most expensive
and are usually given only to the immediate
family and the attendants. The smaller pictures
of the bride and groom are given to all the friends
and relatives, especially those in the old country.
This is an important means of keeping up the
connection with those at home. An enlarged and[102]
colored copy framed in an ornate gilt frame is
usually ordered for the newly married couple,
and is an added expense.

The cost of automobiles is also important.
The bridal party, and sometimes the guests whom
it is desired to honor, are taken to the church,
then to the photographer's, and then to the hall
where the feast and dance are held. Sometimes
as many as six automobiles are observed drawn
up in front of one of the little photographers'
shops in an immigrant district.

Many people seem to think that the festivities
among the foreign born are becoming simpler.
The extravagance is perhaps again a question of
the transition to a money economy. The ceremony
in the old country was an occasion for
great celebration, with feasting and dancing for
several days, but was perhaps not expensive when
the necessary articles were produced at home or
received in exchange for home products. Here
the immigrant family does not at first realize the
real value of the money which seems so plentiful,
and the old customs are not only carried out, but
elaborated because of the added feeling of
prosperity.

In many ways the old customs are now being
modified. Among the Polish, for instance, the
guests used to give presents of money, practically
buying a dance with the bride. The custom
has been frequently abused here, as the men have[103]
divided their gifts into small parts and demanded
many dances with the bride, often causing her
to dance so much as to cause serious fatigue.
For this reason we heard of one bride who simply
"walked with the plate" instead of dancing.
Another story is told of a wedding in a Polish
community, at which the men threw dollars at
a plate. The one who was successful in breaking
the plate might dance with the bride.

This Polish custom of giving money gifts offsets
to a large extent the cost of the wedding.
Among three Polish families visited, one whose
wedding cost $200 collected $60; another spent
$150 and collected $160; and a third spent $200
and collected $300. But this custom, too, tends
to disappear in the second generation. A young
Russian couple, for instance, were opposed to a
regular collection, but the parents, who consider
it the blessing to their daughter, could not resist
each leaving a ten-dollar bill as they left. The
young people were embarrassed, but the other
guests quickly followed the suggestion, and $100
was collected.


CHRISTENINGS AND FÊTE DAYS

This naïve solicitation of gifts is also practiced
on the occasion of the christening of the infant.
An unmarried godmother may be preferred because,
having no children of her own, she is more
able to make handsome gifts at the time and to[104]
continue her contributions. One young Russian
girl, whose marriage with the father of her unborn
child was arranged by a social worker,
asked the new friend to serve as godmother, and
then expected an outfit for the infant in christening
robes, little veils, and other articles, costing
about $75.

Observers interested in customs in immigrant
districts say that the custom of soliciting gifts at
christenings was modified during the war. Among
Polish families, for example, each guest used to
make a present in money to the child who was
christened. During the last few years it has become
more and more customary for the collection
to be taken for the benefit of Polish war
orphans. The amount collected is then announced
in the paper and serves as a source of prestige to
the family.

There are also numerous fête days and religious
celebrations which call for special expenditure.
It is impossible to consider all these here, but
attention should be called to an important event
in the religious life; namely, the occasion of the
first communion. The expenses for the confirmation
of a boy are not great. He usually has a
new suit and wears a flower in his buttonhole.
He must have beads, prayer book, and, if he is
Polish, a candle.

One little Polish girl who made her first communion
in the summer of 1919 had an outfit that[105]
cost her $30. This did not represent the entire
cost, as she had several parts of the outfit given
to her; her godmother made the dress, although
the little girl herself furnished the material; the
veil with the wreath of flowers was given her by
a nun who had taken an interest in her, and the
candle, which it is still customary in Polish
churches to carry, was given by a cousin who is
a nun. She had to buy the material for her dress,
white slippers, stockings, and long white gloves,
beads, flowers, and photographs. If she had
herself borne all the expense, a minimum estimate
of the cost would be $50.


BUYING PROPERTY

A third motive for saving is the desire for home
ownership or for acquiring land. There is no
doubt that to own a home of their own is the
desire of most immigrant families. Many of
them come from countries where the ownership
of land carries with it a degree of social prestige
that is unknown in more highly developed communities
of the modern industrial civilization.

Representatives of the Bohemians, Lithuanians,
Poles, and Italians have all emphasized
the fact that their people want to own their own
homes, and bend every energy toward this end,
so that the whole family often works in order
that first payments may be made or later payments
kept up. The Croatians, Slovaks, Hungarians,[106]
and Slovenians are also said to be buying
houses, although, as they are newer groups,
they have not yet done so to the same extent as
the other groups. The Serbians, Rumanians,
Bulgarians, and Russians in Chicago are, on the
other hand, said to be planning to return in large
numbers to the old homes in Europe, and hence
are not interested in buying property in this
country. Their feeling for the land and their desire
to own their homes in the country in which
they decide to settle is said to be as strong as
in the other groups.

The longing for home ownership was apparent
in the family schedules we obtained, and in studies
of housing conditions[26] in certain districts of Chicago
we find additional evidence of the immigrants'
desire to own their own homes, and the
way in which this desire leads many to buy, even
in the congested districts of the city. The following
table gives the number and the percentage
of home owners in eight selected districts. It
will be noted that the percentage of owners varied
from eight in one of the most congested Italian
districts known as "Little Sicily," to twenty-four
in the Lithuanian district.

The strength of the desire for homes can also
be measured by the sacrifices which many of the
[107]families make to enable them to acquire property.
It means in some cases the sacrifice of the children's
education, the crowding of the home with
lodgers, or the mother's going out to work. In
fact, immigrant leaders interviewed seem to think
that women's entrance into industry during the
war was largely due to the desire to own their
own homes. After the title to the house is acquired,
it is often crowded with other tenants to
help finish the payments.

The housing studies in Chicago furnish many
illustrations of this sacrifice.[27] For example,
among the Lithuanians in the Fourth Ward,
there was a landlord who lived in three cellar
rooms so low that a person more than five feet
[108]eight inches tall could not stand upright in them.
The kitchen, a fair-sized room with windows on
the street&mdash;though its gray-painted wooden walls
and ceiling served well to accentuate the absence
of sunlight, was merely gloomy, but the other
two rooms were both small and dark, with tiny
lot-line windows only four square feet in area.
In one of these rooms, 564 cubic feet in contents,
the father and one child slept; the other, which
contained only 443 cubic feet, was the bedroom
of the mother and two children. One of the
highly colored holy pictures common among the
Lithuanians and Poles, though it hung right by
the window, was an indistinguishable blur.

The agency through which the purchase is
made may be either the real-estate dealer of the
same national group, or, more commonly, the
building and loan association. The real-estate
agents to whom the foreign-speaking immigrants
go are like the steamship agents, the immigrant
bankers, the keepers of special shops. Those
who are honest and intelligent render invaluable
services; those who wish to exploit have the same
opportunity of doing so that is taken advantage
of by the shyster lawyer, the quack doctor, the
sharp dealer of any kind who speaks the language
and preys upon his fellow countrymen. Reference
has been made in an earlier chapter to the
services rendered by the building and loan associations
in enabling the foreign born to obtain[109]
homes. They also render services in providing
the means for safe investment for those with only
small sums to invest.


BUILDING AND LOAN ASSOCIATIONS

These societies are frequently organized along
national lines. For example, among those listed
in 1893 by the United States Commissioner of
Labor[28] are the Bohemian Building and Loan,
organized February 1, 1886; the Bohemian California
Homestead (February 15, 1892); the Bohemian
National Building Loan and Homestead
(January 30, 1888); the Bohemian Workingmen's
Loan and Homestead (April 20, 1890); the Ceska
Koruna Homestead (May 6, 1892); the King
Kazimer the Great Building and Loan (January
27, 1886); the King Mieczyslaus the First National
Building Loan and Savings Bank (June 3,
1889); King Zigsmund the First Building and
Loan (April 15, 1891). December 1, 1918, there
were 681 such organizations in Illinois; 255 of
these were in Chicago and the majority were
conducted and patronized by the foreign born.

The following is briefly the method by which
the building and loan associations perform the
two services of providing for investment and
lending money on homes:[29]
[110]
The stockholder or member pays a stipulated minimum
sum, say one dollar, when he takes his membership, and buys
a share of stock. He then continues to pay a like sum each
month until the aggregate of sums paid, augmented by the
profits, amounts to the maturing value of the stock, usually
$200, and at this time the stockholder is entitled to the full
maturing value of the share, and surrenders the same.

A shareholder who desires to build a house and has
secured a lot for that purpose, may borrow money from the
association of which he is a member. Suppose a man who
has secured his lot wishes to borrow $1,000 for the erection
of a house. He must be the holder of five shares in his
association, each share having as its maturing value $200.
His five shares, therefore, when matured, would be worth
$1,000, the amount of money which he desires to borrow....
In a building and loan association the money is put up
at auction, usually in open meeting on the night or at the
time of the payment of dues. Those who wish to borrow
bid a premium above the regular rate of interest charged,
and the one who bids the highest premium is awarded the
loan. The man who wishes to build his house, therefore,
and desires to borrow $1,000, must have five shares of stock
in his association, must bid the highest premium, and then
the $1,000 will be loaned to him. To secure this $1,000 he
gives the association a mortgage on his property and pledges
his five shares of stock. To cancel this debt he is constantly
paying his monthly or semimonthly dues, until such time
as the constant payment of dues, plus the accumulation of
profits through compounded interest, matures the shares
at $200 each. At this time, then, he surrenders his shares,
and the debt upon his property is canceled.



ITALIANS HAVE THEIR OWN FINANCIAL CENTER AND LABOR MARKET IN BOSTON


In some cases the sums paid are fifty or even
twenty-five cents a week, and the shares may be
$100 instead of $200. Among some groups shares
are taken in the name of each of the children, and
the investment constitutes an educational fund.[111]
There are those, however, for whom the building
and loan has not provided adequate opportunity
for deposit and safe investment. It is probable
that the building and loan has proved most efficient
for the income group $1,500-$1,800. For
the group below that, home ownership is for the
time impossible. As a device for saving, for both
the lower and higher income groups, who come
from countries familiar with similar devices, the
postal savings banks are supposed to offer efficient,
honest, and convenient service.


POSTAL SAVINGS BANKS

These banks were established under an act that
went into effect June 25, 1910. Under this law,
as amended May 18, 1916, persons over ten years
of age may deposit any amount, providing the
balance to the credit of one depositor does not
exceed $1,000. Two per cent interest is paid on
deposits, and there is provision for exchange of
deposits for United States bonds of small
denominations.

The facilities thus provided were immediately
taken advantage of by the foreign-born groups,
and the postal savings banks became almost
banks for the foreign born. That is, in September,
1916, 375,000, or 80 per cent, of the total
number of depositors were persons of foreign
birth, and they owned 75 per cent of the deposits.
In proportion to population the deposits were in[112]
1916 about eleven times as great as those of the
native born (due allowance being made for the
age of the two population groups). The Greeks,
Italians, Russians, and Hungarians, all coming
from countries in which there are postal savings
arrangements, found it especially easy to make
use of them.

The department felt, however, that the facilities
could be greatly extended, even among the
foreign born. Therefore, circulars describing the
organization, methods, and advantages were
distributed. They were written in the following
languages: English, Bohemian, Bulgarian, Chinese,
Croatian, Danish, Finnish, French, German,
Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Lithuanian,
Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian,
Ruthenian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish,
Swedish, and Yiddish.

In spite of the fact that this system is characterized
not only by security, but also by
certain democratic and convenient features
especially serviceable to many foreign born,
there are certain limitations to which Professor
Kemmerer has called attention in the following
statement:

As a matter of fact, the interest rate paid is so low that
it makes a very weak appeal to the class of people who
deposit in the postal savings banks. Their motive is primarily
security. The government is now realizing large
profits from the postal savings system&mdash;for 1916 the estimated[113]
profit was $481,816&mdash;and this profit is coming from
a class of people in the community, the thrifty poor, from
whom it is bad social policy to take it. Of course it would
be administratively impracticable to pay interest to depositors
on average daily balances&mdash;no savings banks do that.
Would it be expecting too much, however, to ask for our
postal savings depositors the allowances of interest on half
yearly or even quarterly balances? Moreover, is it unreasonable
to ask the Board of Trustees, in view of the nomadic
character of our foreign-born population which patronizes
the postal savings system most, to devise a simple system
of transfer by which a depositor who is changing his
place of residence may transfer his postal savings account
without forfeiting his accumulated but yet undue
interest?[30]

Not only should the postal savings bank law
be amended, rendering it more flexible and more
attractive, but there should also be enacted in
those states in which no such legislation is yet
on the statute books, laws regulating the conduct
of banks, steamship companies, and all
agencies receiving deposits or otherwise performing
banking functions.

It is clear that the foreign born, during the
early years of their residence in the United States,
encounter all the difficulties of others whose incomes
are inadequate and precarious, and are
also the easy victims of special forms of exploitation.
In addition, they find themselves unfamiliar
with the standards and customs connected
with the great events of family life. In
[114]the matter of weddings and funerals and other
ceremonial occasions there is no reason to expect
them to be wiser, more economical, and farsighted
than the native-born group.

In the adjustment between future and present
needs, foreign-born housewives need, as most
housewives need, instruction in the art of spending,
in the selection of food and clothing, and the
variety of demands for which provision must be
deliberately made in a modern industrial community.
In an earlier and simpler situation provision
for these needs was made without conscious
effort.

In this connection it is interesting to note that
the "Thrift Leaflets" prepared by the United
States Department of Agriculture and the Department
of the Treasury for the war saving
stamps thrift campaign, urged care in the use
of articles and dealt with prevention of waste
rather than with saving. Obviously, if goods
were more carefully used, more could be saved
and invested in the securities thus being indirectly
urged. It is conceivable, however, that
wise use may mean the purchase of better food,
the selection of more satisfactory clothing, and
the enjoyment of better housing, rather than
investment in government or any other securities.
The thrift campaigns of the United States Treasury
proposed standards of saving only for those
receiving an income of $1,200 or more, with the[115]
exception of unmarried persons earning as much
as $780.


ACCOUNT KEEPING

The basis of sound saving or spending is the
account book, carefully kept over an interval of
time, allowing comparison between the outlay
and enjoyment as experienced at different periods.
Such account books are being urged by the
extension departments of the state agricultural
colleges in co-operation with the Departments of
Agriculture.

Most account books that have been so far devised
are, however, quite difficult and uninteresting,
even for the American housewife, demanding
classifications of items which require too much
time and consideration. An account book on a
weekly basis, providing very simple divisions of
the expenditures of the household, and giving
space also for the personal expenses of the various
members of the family, has been published by
the Committee on Household Budgets of the
American Home Economics Association.[31]

These books could be easily issued in different
languages and be made available for the foreign-born
housewife. She, like all housewives, would
be benefited by seeing what she is spending her
[116]money for. It would lead to a definite planning
of her expenditures. By this means it could be
suggested that things may have changed in value
for her in the new country. Old wants are replaced
by new ones, and a new system of saving
and spending might be worked out.




[117]
V

THE NEGLECTED ART OF SPENDING


Saving is the problem of over there, and of the
future. Spending is the problem of here and now,
and in the expenditure for present needs as well
as in saving for future wants the foreign-born
housewife meets with special difficulties. She is
handicapped by the kinds of places at which she
must buy, because of language, custom, and time
limitations, as well as the grade of article available.
Through the complicated maze of choices
open to her she must steer her way to obtain for
her family the highest returns for an all too small
expenditure. The art of spending, too often
neglected by her native-born sisters, takes on
added difficulties for the untrained immigrant
woman.

From the point of view of the housewife the
desirable thing is that the transaction of buying
her household goods and food and of selecting her
house, shall be as simple as possible. It should
be made easy for her to know the quantity and
to judge the quality of any article she considers,
so that she may the more easily compare its possible[118]
use to her with the use of other articles that
might be secured for the same amount of money.
It is also important that she have as definite ideas
as possible as to the range of the demand for different
kinds of goods, so that she may buy as
few as possible of the goods on which the price of
special risk is placed. In many cases she needs
really expert advice. In the absence of such help
she may do her buying in either of two states of
mind. She may think that all merchants are
cheats, there "to do her and to do her first," or
she may think that she has a right to expect from
the dealer frank and kindly advice.

In the present state of the retail organization
she may find either attitude. In shops kept by
her co-nationals she will naturally have the
utmost confidence. This puts the small neighborhood
stores in a position of peculiar privilege,
and makes it doubly easy for them to take subtle
advantage of the unwary customer. Even when
the dealer takes no special advantage of his customer,
in following the general practice of the
trade, he can create innumerable situations in
which her problem is rendered more, rather than
less, complicated. The indefinite package is substituted
for the definite weight or measure. The
"bars" of soap vary in weight and in composition.
The trade mark used to tell her that X
made goods whose quality she knew; the trade
name, based on incalculable sums spent in skillful[119]
advertising, tells her nothing that is of intrinsic
use to her. It connects a name with a repeated
suggestion that she buy. By the trading stamp,
the premium, and the bargain counter the merchant
tries to persuade her that she is getting
more than she pays for. He appeals to the gambling
instinct and introduces into a drab life
something of the excitement of the roulette table.


THE COMPANY STORE

In mining communities and other places in which
there are "company stores," there is the pressure
exercised by the employer to force the employee
to deal only with the company store, even when
there are other stores in the neighborhood.

The United States Immigration Commission
had something to say on this point. It made it
clear that, while there are instances of an employer
giving his employees a fair deal when he
becomes merchant and they purchasers, the combination
of employing and merchandising functions
is often perilous. Even if the employee
appears to have a choice, he fears the loss of his
job if he does not buy at the company store. The
evils connected with so-called "truck payments"
have long been recognized. They change only in
form when the company check replaces the old
payment in kind.[32]
[120]
In some states this evil has been recognized by
legislation prohibiting the combination of industrial
and merchandising functions. Where such
is the case, as in Pennsylvania, the statute is
evaded. A separate corporation is organized by
the same individuals, or a store is conducted by
an individual who is a member of the mining
corporation. Where there is a "store" administered
in any of these ways, "company checks"
may be issued between pay days. Or "store
books" may be issued, the items purchased being
recorded, and deducted on pay day from the
wages of the employee.

The Immigration Commission published a
table[33] of the expenditures at such stores, the
amounts deducted from the wages, and the proportion
of earnings left to be collected at the end
of the month, illustrating the confusing effect of
these practices on the housewife whose income
should be a settled and regular amount. While
some of the Croatians and Magyars spent hardly
a fourth or a third of their earnings at the company
store, others in the same national groups
collected on pay day less than a fifth or even less
than a tenth of their earnings. From this balance
must come the payments for rent, medical service,
entertainment, school, for all things other
than food, clothes, and furniture.
[121]
It may be that in some cases the employee is
able to secure at the company store as good articles
as he can obtain elsewhere and for the same
prices, but this is by no means common. In
West Virginia it was found necessary to enact
legislation forbidding a company which ran a
store to charge its own employees higher prices
than the employees of other companies were
charged.[34] The Immigration Commission found
not only that in some cases the stock was inferior
and the prices high, but that there was a sense
of compulsion that made it almost impossible to
adjust income and needs.

It is hardly necessary to point out that the
supply of housing accommodations by the employer
has the same influence as the supply of
food and clothing. The power as employer may
be, and often is, exerted to fix the conditions
under which the family life goes on; and the tenant
is deprived of the experience of selecting, of
choosing, of balancing what one gives with what
one gets.[35]

A similar objection may be raised to payment
of wages by check. In the old days, before the
world went dry, one service the saloon was frequently
[122]called on to render was that of cashing
checks. Either payment in "lawful money" or
an opportunity to exchange at once for lawful
money is the only method of paying wages that
gives the housewife her full opportunity.


SHOPPING HABITS

The immigrant housewife is restricted by her
ignorance of places and methods of marketing,
and so feels the necessity of buying in the immigrant
neighborhood. Among the 90 Chicago families
from whom schedules were obtained, representing
Bohemian, Croatian, Italian, Polish, Russian,
Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, and Ukrainian
groups, 72 purchased all their food in the neighborhood
stores, 2 kept their own stores, and only
16 were seeking bargains in other localities.
Among these 16, 5 were going to larger business
centers near their neighborhood, 4 bought in
downtown department stores, 1 used a mail-order
house, 1 went to a well-established "cash and
carry" store, 2 bought in the wholesale markets,
and only 2 took advantage of the co-operative
association of their own group.

The 72 families who were marketing exclusively
in their own neighborhoods were patronizing
for the most part stores owned by
foreign-speaking people or those employing foreign-born
salesmen to attract the housewives of
particular groups. A Croatian woman says that[123]
when she tries to do her marketing downtown
she sees many new things and would like to ask
what they are used for, but she does not know
how to ask. In her neighborhood store the
grocer can easily explain to her. One Polish
woman reads the advertisements in the papers
and buys where there is a sale. She thinks that
an alleged Polish co-operative is expensive and
prefers the large department stores, but for the
first few years she bought everything in her
neighborhood where the clerks speak Polish.

The prevalence of the immigrant store may be
illustrated by a detailed study that was made of
the Sixteenth Ward in Chicago. The population
of the ward is predominantly Polish, with an intermingling
of Jewish, German, and Slovak in
the southern portion. In the twenty-five blocks
there are 113 retail stores, 44 of which are grocery
and delicatessen stores, meat markets, and
bakeries. In one block there are 5 grocery and
delicatessen stores, and at least 1 in every block
which has any stores. Most of these shops are
small and crowded, with family living rooms in
the rear. For the most part, the nationality of
the proprietor is that of the majority in the
block, and there are only 14 proprietors of all
the 113 stores who are not Polish.

The difficulty with the language, however, extends
beyond merely talking in the store. A
Ukrainian mother, who admits being afraid to[124]
go beyond her own neighborhood, is perhaps
typical of many foreign-born mothers to whom
a trip to the central shopping district is a strange
and terrifying adventure.

There is also the question of the means with
which to buy. An Italian mother says that she
buys at the chain store when she has the cash,
and at other times in the Italian stores where,
although the prices are higher, she can run a
charge account. The system of buying on credit
at the local store is spoken of as practically universal
in all the foreign-born groups. The purchaser
carries a small blank book, in which the
merchant enters in large figures merely the sum
charged, with no indication of what was bought
or the amount. The account is settled on pay
day by the man of the family. There is,
of course, every chance for inaccurate entry.
It is not surprising, then, that one hears
from many sources that buying food is generally
extravagant.

Women often do the buying. Whether or not
it is the more common among foreign-born families
than among native born for the children to
be sent to the store, we cannot say. Since the
marketing is done so largely in immigrant stores,
there is perhaps not the need for an English-speaking
member of the family to do the purchasing.
We find among 89, 43 mothers who
still do all their own buying, 32 who allow[125]
the children to do part, 4 who share the task
with the father, and only 10 who never do
any of the buying. In this last group of 10
families there are 7 in which the children do
all the marketing and 3 in which it is done by
the father.

Even the skilled housekeepers have little experience
in buying. At home they were used to
storing vegetables in quantities; potatoes in
caves, beets and cabbage by a process of fermentation,
other vegetables and fruits by drying. In
the United States this sort of thing is not done.
There is, in the first place, no place for storage,
and the initial cost of vegetables is high and
quality poor, and the women know nothing of
modern processes of canning.

It is difficult to discover the general practice
with regard to the quantity of food bought at
one time, since it must necessarily vary considerably.
Meat, milk, bread, perishable fruits and
vegetables must usually be purchased daily. As
for staple food, the thrifty housewife will buy in
as large quantities as she can afford in order to
save both money and time.

Reference has been made, however, to the lack
of storage space and the consequent necessity
of buying very little at one time. Thirty-three,
or two fifths, of the 81 foreign housewives who
were interviewed on this subject report that
they buy food in daily supplies; 1 buys twice a[126]
day and 1 for each meal. Forty, however, buy
in larger quantities. Twenty-nine for the week
and 11 for a month at a time. Six say that they
buy whenever they have the money. It must
never be forgotten that among the lower-income
groups, to have more in the house is to have
more eaten, and that cannot be afforded.

Besides the high prices, one of the other limitations
of the foreign-born neighborhood store is
the low quality of the food. This may be illustrated
by a description of the markets in one
Lithuanian neighborhood back of the stockyards,
where men are working at low-grade labor in the
yards, and the women are keeping lodgers, where
few speak English and not many ever go more
than a few blocks from home. The typical market
in this neighborhood&mdash;and there are sometimes
as many as ten in a block&mdash;is a combined
meat market and grocery store. Such stores are
found in the poorer neighborhoods of every
settlement.

Stock in all these stores is the same; there is
a great deal of fresh meat, apparently the poorer
cuts, scraps, etc.; shelves are filled with canned
fruits, canned vegetables, canned soups, and
condensed milk; there is much of the bakers'
"Lithuanian rye bread," and quantities of such
cakes as are sold by the National Biscuit Company.
No fresh vegetables are to be seen in
any of these stores. The reason given by shopkeepers[127]
is that they are little used in the neighborhood
and that the truck wagons supply the
demand.

Women who actually depend upon these stores
and the truck wagons for all their supplies find
them very unsatisfactory. No really fresh vegetables
are to be found in either stores or wagons,
they say. In commenting upon this situation,
several persons have expressed a belief that the
restriction of diet among Lithuanian immigrants
was largely due to the fact that the markets
afford so little variety, and that an effort to extend
the stock in the stores would find a response
in the community.

These stores, however, are widely different from
those found in Italian neighborhoods. Practically
all the food used by the Italian families of
one such neighborhood is bought in these stores.
In this district the population is as dense as back
of the stockyards, and the families have comparable
incomes, the men being engaged in unskilled
occupations and their earnings being supplemented
by the earnings of women and children.
The number of food stores in a block is
about the same as in the other district, but the
stock carried differs greatly. Here, in place of
shops that carry only meat, canned goods, and
potatoes, cabbages, and beets, the greengrocery
stores largely predominate.

There are four or five greengrocery shops to[128]
one meat market, and these stores have a surprising
variety of fresh vegetables and fruits all
the year. The variety of salad greens is remarkable.
More Swiss chard, mustard, dandelion
leaves, endive, squash blossoms and leaves, escarole,
are to be seen in one little Italian store than
in a half dozen American markets. Legumes are
in stock in great quantity and variety&mdash;there are
some little stores that do not handle greengroceries,
but carry large stocks of legumes. Every
store has a large case of different varieties of
Italian cheese, and the variety of macaroni,
spaghetti, and noodles is amazing to an American.
Fish is frequently sold from stalls along
the street, and on Friday fish wagons go about
through the district. Sometimes meat is sold
from wagons, but less to Italians than to other
nationalities living in the neighborhood.

Certainly one effect of the organization of these
shops on the basis of nationality is to prevent
the members of one group from gaining the advantage
of dietetically better practices followed
in other groups. The Lithuanian and Italian
neighborhoods described happened to be in widely
separated districts of the city, but often similar
differences may be observed between two shops
within the same block that serve different national
groups.

It is clear that the retail trade, being unstandardized,
gives no help to the immigrant[129]
woman in the matter of efficient buying. There
is as yet no fine art of service in this field based
on careful accounting of cost and service. Obviously
there is great waste in the number of stores,
in the number of persons engaged in conducting
them, in the needless duplication of even such
meager equipment as is found in them. This
waste will reflect itself in needlessly high prices
which, while they mulct the buyer, bring the
seller little gain.

Evidently, then, little or no help is given
through the system of retail trading to the foreign-born
housewife in the matter of adapting
the diet of her family to American or dietetic
requirements. Yet food demands a large share
of the income. In the latest report on the cost
of living in the United States, in only 8 out of
45 cities were the food demands met by less than
40 per cent of the entire expenditure in the group
whose incomes were between $900 and $1,200.[36]
Those cities were:



Pana, Illinois39.4
Buffalo, New York38.9
Wilmington, Delaware38.9
Dover, New Jersey38.8
Indianapolis, Indiana37.6
Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota37.6
Steubenville, Ohio37.3
Fort Wayne, Indiana35.6


[130]
The lowest proportion was in Fort Wayne, where
over a third of the income was required for feeding
the families in this income group.


MODIFICATION OF DIET

No extensive study of the dietary practices of
the different groups, either here or in the old
country, has been undertaken, but considerable
evidence has been secured in substantiation of
the fact that their old-country practices are being
modified in this country. This is not being done
consciously in response to dietetic requirements,
but often blindly in response to what seem to
be American customs or necessities. There has
been some conflict of testimony with regard to
the changes in the Czecho-Slovak and Croatian
groups. The Italians are said by all to have
made very slight changes in their diet in this
country. The Lithuanians, Poles, Russians, and
Ukrainians, on the other hand, are said to have
made very radical changes.

The modification that is spoken of most frequently
and that is of gravest concern to many
of their leaders, is the increased use of meat.
Attention has already been called to the explanation
of this in the fact that the price of meat was
prohibitive at home, and that fruit, vegetables,
and dairy products were enjoyed without expenditure
of money. The large number of stores
in which meat is offered for sale, although undoubtedly[131]
reflecting the general wishes of the
group, offers constant suggestion to the individual
purchaser to buy meat. The naïve
belief that much meat must be eaten by
men doing manual labor is said to be another
factor.

Excessive use of coffee is said by visiting housekeepers
and others familiar with dietetic problems
to be one of the most serious faults of the
diet of many groups, especially the Slavic groups.
It is a general custom to put the coffee pot on the
stove in the morning and leave it there all day
for any member of the family to help himself to
coffee when he wants it. This is entirely a new
habit which has been learned in America, as
coffee was almost unknown in the poorer groups
in the old country. One explanation that was
given by a foreign-born woman was that these
families were used to a diet of soup at home, and
that as they gave this up in this country they
felt the need of some liquid to replace it. One
Polish woman who was asked if she had changed
her diet in this country, replied, "Naturally, at
home everyone had soup for breakfast, and here
everyone has coffee and bread."

Another change that was reported over and
over again was the use of more cakes and sweet
rolls. This seemed to be considered a peculiarly
American change, as was evidenced by the families
who reported that they had not changed[132]
their diet, as they didn't like the American diet
of cakes. Some of them, indeed, were very scornful
of what they considered the American diet,
saying among other things that they could not
afford to eat steak and chops every day, that they
did not like sweets, that their "men" would not
eat "out of a can," that they did not like fried
things. Their ideas of American diet were gained
in part from the food in restaurants, in part from
what the children learned in cooking lessons in
school, and in part from general suggestions that
they have picked up.

Undoubtedly misguided social workers who
have tried to give advice on diet without themselves
knowing much about it, are responsible
for some of these ideas. In a certain mill town
in Massachusetts, for example, a social worker
employed by the mill discovered what she thought
was the cause of the paper falling off the walls in
the fact that the people boiled their food. She
therefore went in and taught them to fry meat
and other foodstuffs.

The problem of how far the immigrant groups
should be encouraged to modify their diet can
be determined only after a careful study of their
dietary practices. The price and quality of food
available to immigrants must be ascertained.
Their habits, customs, and preferences must be
thoroughly understood. There can be no question,
however, that help should be given them[133]
in making the modifications required by the
changed environment.

There have been a number of suggestions of
the best way to accomplish this. Visiting housekeepers
or visiting dietitians have been suggested
and will be discussed later. It is highly probable
that help must first be given to immigrant women
in their homes before they can be persuaded to
attend any classes or demonstrations outside of
their homes. They must gradually be persuaded
to take advantage of the help obtainable in this
way.

That the whole problem of diets suited to special
needs of people is being considered is evidenced
by the fact that it has been suggested
that food be sold by units of energy value. Dr.
Graham Lusk, for example, proposed at a time
of great distress in New York that the Health
Commissioner attempt to persuade grocers to
prepare "Board of Health baskets" which would
provide 10,000 calories daily for a family of five
at a minimum cost.[37] The United States Commissioner
of Labor indorses the idea in the following
words, "There are no insuperable obstacles
in the way of selling bread, beef, pork, eggs,
milk, cabbage, onions, corn, sugar&mdash;by the 100
or 1,000 calories."[38] Professor Murlin has advocated
[134]that manufacturers be compelled to place
on food containers the calorie content of the
package.

If such a plan could be worked out, the dietetic
virtues and weaknesses of the different
groups could serve as a basis for the special form
in which foodstuffs were marketed in different
areas. Any such project as applied to the foreign
born is far from accomplishment. It is suggestive
of a new attitude which does not continue to leave
the matter of diet to chance.


FURNITURE ON THE INSTALLMENT PLAN

In the purchase of furniture and of clothing there
is the temptation to buy on the installment plan.
This plan is open to all the objections ordinarily
brought against buying on credit. The buyer is
tempted to overestimate his ability to pay in
the future, and he may not take the same trouble
to calculate the actual value of his purchase as
when he pays money down. In the past the form
of sale has often been such as to place him
peculiarly at the mercy of the seller, who might
find it more profitable to reclaim the possession
of goods on which a considerable share of the
price has been paid than to extend the time of
payment and allow the payment to be completed.

The superintendent of the Bohemian Charitable
Association says, for example, that it is very
common for newly married people to load themselves[135]
with debt for household furniture, and
that at least two thirds of the stoves which are
commonly bought on the installment plan are
taken back by the dealers before payments are
finished. The immigrant from the rural community
may be quite unused to purchasing furniture
of any sort, and may be easily persuaded
to buy what he thinks is "American style."

The Lithuanian peasant, for example, had
little furniture at home. In the cottage of two
rooms, one was used on the occasion of the visit
of the priest or at the time of a wedding or
funeral, and contained nothing but the shrine
and the dowry chest of the daughters. The walls
were decorated with paper flowers and cheap
lithographs. In Lithuanian homes here one is
struck by the fact that among the more prosperous
the same sort of furniture is seen in all
the houses. This consists of the heavy oak and
leather sets of three or four large pieces usually
sold on the installment plan by stores in the
immigrant districts. It is not beautiful, and
there is no reason to think that it is distinctly
American, but the immigrant is not in a position
to know that.


NEW FASHIONS AND OLD CLOTHES

Then there is the unsolved problem of clothing.
As in the case of food, so with dress; the general
effect of the organization of the department stores[136]
in the different neighborhoods can be only misleading
and confusing. Many misleading devices
that would no longer deceive the older residents
are tried again on the newcomer.

The women at first find it difficult to judge of
values and prices. The local stores are there
with the bargain counter and the special sale and
all the other devices. The Poles and the Lithuanians
with whom we have talked have dwelt
especially on the helplessness of their countrywomen
in the hands of the unscrupulous merchant
or the shrewd clerk.

Clothing presents to even the enlightened and
the sophisticated a most difficult problem in domestic
management. "Fashion wears out more
garments than the man." The anthropologist,
the physiologist, and the sociologist are all concerned
to explain why the clothing worn to-day
is often so unsuited to bodily needs as well as to
the demands of beauty and fitness.[39] To a very
real extent practices of waste prevail in the
selection of clothing, and to that extent neither
reason nor art finds a place in the scheme. Where
an attempt at economy is made, the influence of
the new science of hygiene is impeded by old
ideas of durability. So that from the well-to-do
of the community comes little suggestion that
[137]can be of service in directing the expenditures
for clothing of any other group.



IT&#39;S A LONG WAY FROM THIS ELABORATE CZECHO-SLOVAK COSTUME TO THE
MODERN AMERICAN STYLES


The foreign born are faced with a particularly
difficult problem. They often come from places
where dress served to show where one came from,
and who one was. In the United States, dress
serves to conceal one's origin and relationships,
and there results an almost inexorable dilemma.
Follow the Old-World practice, and show who
you are and where you come from, and the result
is that you remain alien and different and that
your children will not stay with you "outside
the gates." Or follow the fashion and be like
others, and the meager income is dissipated before
your eyes, with meager results. The Croatians
have emphasized the waste of American
dress and the immodest styles often worn, while
the Italians have chiefly dwelt upon the friction
between parents and children.

In some neighborhoods Jewish agents go about
offering clothing on the installment plan at prices
much higher than those charged even in inefficient
neighborhood shops. Shoes are particularly a
source of difficulty, both those for the younger
children and those for the older boy or girl who
goes to work. In some neighborhoods where the
older women go barefooted and are thought to do
so because they wish to cling to their Old-World
customs, they are simply saving, so that the
children may wear "American shoes."[138]

Certainly the foreign-born woman who undertakes
to manage her family's affairs in an American
community is confronted by no easy task.
The question arises as to what might be done to
render that task less difficult. The dull of sight
cannot lead the blind at a very swift pace. But
certain steps might be taken to simplify the
problems for all consumers, including the foreign
born. In fact, whatever renders the system of
retail dealing less chaotic and less wasteful will
benefit all. The establishment of markets for
foodstuffs at appropriate places where grower
and consumer can meet, and certain costs of
double cartage can be eliminated, is, for example,
a recognized item in reform of the present food
traffic.


TRAINING NEEDED

The importance of the spending function of the
housewife must be brought home more clearly
to great numbers of women. Too few native-born
housewives realize that they have any problem
to work out, or that there may be an "art
of spending." None of the ninety foreign-born
women interviewed had received any instruction
in buying except advice from friends or from
their own children. What little instruction they
had received had been concerned only with cooking.
Not one of these women recognized any
difficulty in buying except the difficulty of speaking[139]
the language well enough to ask for things
or to understand how much they cost, or of
getting the wherewithal to pay.

It is by the slow process of continual suggestion
that both women consumers and distributing
agencies will be awakened to the problem.
Evidence of this awakening is already apparent.
Schools and colleges, with their domestic-science
and household-budgeting courses, are raising the
question among an ever-widening circle of people.
Banks and brokers with their special woman's
department are advising and suggesting ways of
spending that save. Newspapers, magazines,
and clubs are discussing household problems.
Organizations, public and private, have worked
out ways and means of helping women budget
their expenditures. So far these varied efforts
have reached chiefly the American women. But
no one group is isolated to-day, and as some
awaken they set in motion the waves of thought
and action that reach their foreign-born neighbor.
Her institutions of press and bank respond with
information and assistance. Inevitably better
housekeepers will result.

In the meantime, all possible assistance must
be given. It is therefore especially important
to establish contacts between agencies already
responsible for developing an art in household
management and the leaders among the various
foreign-born groups. Provision should be made[140]
for young women from among those groups to
obtain a higher education than has been commonly
thought necessary by them or than has
in many cases been possible from a pecuniary
standpoint.

Much could undoubtedly be accomplished by
the establishment in connection with departments
of home economics and household arts in
the various colleges of funds making possible the
compilation of material bearing on these particular
points. Scholarships and fellowships can be
made especially available to young women from
among these groups who desire to pursue their
education in these lines.

The household arts departments of the various
universities are attempting to plan a "standardized
dress," the social workers are developing a
list of garments,[40] and an estimate of expenditures
for the use of case-work agencies in the care of
dependent families,[41] the Young Women's Christian
Association is carrying on a health campaign[42]
directed particularly at the problem of
proper shoes. In the meantime the Sunday
papers carry full-page advertisements describing
in specious and misleading terms the bargains in
clothing to be had the following day, and the
[141]merry round continues. The tragedy works itself
out both in the dissipation of the income and in
the friction created between parents and children,
to which reference will be made in another
place.

But perhaps more important is the possibility of
modifying the practices of the retail trade itself.
Restrictions have been placed about the trade in
such legislation as has been passed against fraudulent
advertising and other fraudulent practices,
as well as by the so-called pure food laws of the
United States and of the various states. And
some influence has been exercised on the conditions
under which goods are made, or under
which they are sold, by the Trade Union Label
League and by the Consumers' League. Neither
of these organizations would, however, directly
touch the life of the foreign-born housewife.


CO-OPERATION IN SPENDING

The question arises as to whether help is to be
expected from co-operative distribution, which
has had such an extraordinary history in England
and been highly developed in a number of the
other European countries. There is always the
temptation to recall the winter evening in December,
1844, when twenty-eight weavers, of
whom two were women, opened in Toad Lane,
Rochdale, Lancashire, a little shop, and began
to sell themselves the necessities of life. Their[142]
remarkable services in England have not been
confined to their business undertakings, but have
always included important educational activities.

In America there have for many years been a
few co-operative stores, some succeeding, some
failing, most of them working out their plans independently
without connection with other similar
stores from whose experience they might
profit. Within the last few years, however, the
number of such stores has greatly increased and
the need for closer union has been felt. This has
resulted in the formation of the Co-operative
League of America. Education in co-operative
buying is its main purpose. At what appears to
be the beginning of an important period in the
extension of the movement in this country it is
worth while to consider how far the existing co-operative
stores in this country are helping the
foreign-born women.

Anything that assists her to lower the cost of
living is beneficial. Although sound practice dictates
that consumer's co-operatives sell their
goods at prices current in their neighborhood,
the profits to the members appear in the return
of a per cent of all purchases. In proportion as
the local stores are able to supply the housewife
with all her goods, the saving on the purchase of
her daily needs will be more appreciable. Her
interest in the enterprise will make her demand
both greater variety and better quality of goods.[143]

Moreover, there may be other than material
gains to the foreign-born woman from her contact
with a co-operative. If it is one formed
by her countrymen, where her mother tongue is
spoken, it may be her first and for a long time
her only contact with anything outside her home.
Natural timidity will readily be overcome if she
can go around the corner to a store kept by
people who speak her language and understand
her wants. As confidence is established she may
venture to other neighborhoods or centers of
distribution where more advantages can be
gained. But unless she gains the confidence
which few immigrant women have at first, she is
an alien and isolated unit in a vast, strange country.
Eventually she may become a member of a
co-operative store.

If she does this, perhaps the most benefit to
the foreign-born woman results. Her incorporation
into this country may well be said to have
been started when she has become an active
member of an institution which is a part of
American life. The benefits are those which result
to any individual from participation in a
going concern. Sharing responsibilities and
evolving policies for a joint enterprise have educational
implications that no other activity can
supply.

The question, then, may be raised as to the
extent to which a development of the co-operative[144]
methods in the United States may be looked to
as likely to become an important educational
agency in intelligent spending for the foreign
housewife, enabling her to develop in her task
something of a technique. As to the possibility
of developing co-operative societies because the
ordinary trade is wasteful, it should be recalled
that the retail trade in the United States, while
wasteful, is probably not less, but rather more
efficient than in other countries. Moreover, in
the United States there are often lacking those
conditions that give rise to a sense of a permanent
division of interest between those who sell and
those who buy. In fact, when the foreign-language
store exists, there may be a tie between
shopkeeper and purchaser.

In communities in which there is an apparent
division of interest between the foreign born and
the native, or between two foreign groups, the
national bond may grow into a social bond that
for a time at least would serve as the basis for
the collective action by one group against the
other group. If the dealers then belong to the
outside group, or if the dealers of the foreign-born
group seem to betray their fellow countrymen,
there may develop a movement strong
enough to carry over into organization.

Among some groups, such as the Finns, the
language constitutes a permanent barrier for the
adult members of the group, and with a skillful[145]
and intelligent leadership the co-operative undertakings
may be expected to prosper for a very
considerable period of time. The immigrants
have probably twice as many successful co-operative
stores as the native born.

In a community like a mining town, that is
almost or altogether an industrial community,
with no leisure class, the pecuniary resources
of all are fairly well known to all, and the
temptation to spend conspicuously is therefore
lacking. It will be recalled that these are
the communities in which the employers have
specially abused their power by forcing the employees
to buy at company stores. In such communities
there are always considerable numbers
of competent, efficient, intelligent persons. Under
a specially able leadership, a special hardship
through high prices, or a condition of special
exploitation, the co-operative store may be expected
to develop. Then, too, a sense of identity
of interest may find its basis in trade-union membership
or in membership in a special trade, as
was the case with the miners in a store at Staunton,
Illinois, where the union managed the store
for years at a profit.

With the exception of these few bonds, however,
there are lacking in most communities several
elements present in the foreign experience
that have undoubtedly contributed materially to
the success of co-operative enterprises. There is,[146]
in the first place, the lack of stability caused by
the rapid movement from group to group. The
older people do not speak English; the children
learn English and often do not want to speak
the language of their parents. They want to be
American and to buy as Americans buy. They
therefore resent any organization that tends to
emphasize their foreign origin.

Also no sense of class consciousness among
customers arouses antagonism against retailers.
In the cities, particularly where there are large
foreign colonies, the retail trade in those colonies,
especially the trade in foodstuffs, is largely in the
hands of fellow countrymen whose background
is much the same as that of their customers.
Most of the stores are small, and the proprietors,
who are not skilled in modern business methods,
do not make much more than a living from their
stores, so that there is no great contrast in prosperity
to arouse a feeling of antagonism.

On the contrary, the proprietor and his family
usually live in the district&mdash;often over the store&mdash;in
much the same condition as the rest of the
group. They are friends of all, and by their
knowledge of the group can meet certain needs
and appear to serve as a connecting link between
the separate group and the general community.
How far the desire of the more ambitious group
members to open up a shop of their own acts as
a deterrent to interest in co-operation would be[147]
difficult to estimate, but it seems probable that
this has some weight.

On the other hand, attention may be called to
the fact that the retail trade, and especially the
marketing of food, has been so slightly reduced
to an art, it is still so empirically and wastefully
carried on, that there are many possibilities of
reasonable success of co-operatives. For a time,
at least, this will be true if the undertaking is on
a modest scale and does not seem worthy of
attack by a relatively powerful group.

Among the obvious wastes are those connected
with the transportation (cross freights), the display
and salesmanship, the marketing of novelties,
and the use of the indefinite measures. Besides
these there are the bad debts resulting from
careless credit transactions, the waste involved
in deliveries of packages, the waste of the repeated
purchase of articles known to be regularly
needed. Wherever any group can be led
to consider the wastes involved in these methods
of doing business, their good sense will make
them perceive easily the folly of persisting in
those ways, and the practice of this minimum of
self-restraint will serve as a basis for a considerable
balance, out of which dividends may
accumulate.

The use of the co-operative idea has, therefore,
great possibilities as the basis for discussing
the wastes of the present system and for deliberation[148]
as to the best or as to any possible way
out. In other words, experimenting in democratic
organization in obtaining the necessities
of life is an important next step. As in the
matter of copartnership in relation to housing,
co-operative distribution may serve as a point
of departure, an object lesson worthy of closer
study and experimental imitation. Especially
would the experience of the Women's Co-operative
Guild be helpful in bringing the idea to the
attention of the influential women among the
various groups.

The importance of doing this cannot be overestimated.
For, as has been so often suggested,
the wastes of retail dealing, while probably not
so great here as in some other countries, are so
enormous that great economies are possible from
even a slight rationalizing process.[43] The development
of a general consciousness of the nature
and extent of these wastes would in itself serve
as a corrective. Moreover, the experience of
the co-operative enterprise may often be carried
over into legislative policy, and in this way give
to the community the benefit of the experiment
tried by a group. Co-operators in England have
both initiated and backed such social legislation
as the Trade Boards Act, the provision for general
maternity care under the Ministry of Health,
and other measures.

VI

THE CARE OF THE CHILDREN


The care of the children is the most important
of the mother's duties. It cannot be thoroughly
done under modern conditions unless the mother
has leisure to inform herself about conditions surrounding
her children at work and at play, and
to keep in touch with their interests, especially
as they grow older. It includes caring for their
physical wants, bathing them and keeping them
clean when they are little, feeding them, providing
their clothing, taking care of them when they
are sick; it also includes looking after their education
and training, choosing the school, seeing
that they get to school regularly and on time,
following their work at school as it is reported
on the monthly report cards, encouraging them
to greater efforts when their work is unsatisfactory,
praising them when they do well, and, above
all, giving them the home training and discipline
that they need. It is the mother who can teach
the children good habits, forming, as only the
home life can form, their standards of right and
wrong; it means watching them at their play or[150]
seeing that they play in a place that is safe without
watching.

As they grow older it means a general supervision
of their recreation and their companions,
judging surrounding influences, having in mind
the dangers that lie in the way of the unwary
maiden and the perils of the impetuous boy.
Times have changed since she was young, and
amid a great variety of choice she must decide
for her children which are harmless influences
and diversions. In the case of the older girls it
means the serious problems of clothes, of amusements,
of earnings, of prospective mating.

The mother shares many of these tasks with
the father. Responsibility for discipline, decisions,
and training must be joint, but the actual
carrying out of these duties is the mother's.
Usually the older children help with the care of
the younger, but the final responsibility rests
upon the mother.



A SLOVAK MOTHER, NEWLY ARRIVED



UNPREPAREDNESS OF THE IMMIGRANT MOTHER

Looking after the physical well-being of the children
is primarily a matter of maintaining them
in health, and hence the discussion of these problems
is left to the division of this study devoted
to that subject. It is sufficient here to note that
it is a peculiarly difficult problem for the foreign-born
mothers. Modern knowledge of child feeding
and modern ideas with regard to daily bathing[151]
are of recent origin. In many of the countries
from which these women come they are
unknown. A Croatian lawyer, who translated
some of the Children's Bureau publications, was
very much interested in the one on the care of
the child of pre-school age. He told the investigator
that there was nothing like that in his
country, and he hoped that this translation might
be used to reach the women in Croatia.

If this is true in matters that pertain to the
physical welfare of children, it is even more
marked in matters affecting their education and
training. The modern idea is that the child should
not be trained and disciplined to be subservient
to the parent, but should be helped to develop
his own personality. It is based on a greater
respect for the intelligence of the child and on
the idea that the early placing of the responsibility
for his acts on the child himself will better
train citizens for a changing world, and especially
for democracy.

These ideas are of comparatively recent formulation,
many of them dating from the impetus
given to the study of the child by modern psychology.
Although of gradual growth, they have
been for a long time implicit in the current practices
of the most enlightened section of the community.
They are understood by a relatively
small part of the community. They are acted on
by much larger groups, so that it is common to[152]
hear members of the generation that is passing
lament the lack of discipline of the children
to-day.

The situation is complicated by the fact that
many people who talk the most about developing
the child's personality stop in practice with
the removal of restraints, without attempting the
more difficult task of developing his sense of responsibility.
The point to note is that the
native born, in part through their own conscious
choice and in part blindly moved by forces they
do not understand, have been gradually moving
away from the old tradition of strict and unquestioning
obedience such as is exacted by military
authorities.

With the immigrant parents the situation is
very different. The countries from which they
come are not republics, and hence the opportunities
for training for intelligent citizenship have
been lacking, especially in the lower economic
groups. The idea of the government has often
been rather to foster that training that makes
for good soldiers. Moreover, the civilizations
from which most of these people came were at
the time static, so that the evils of blind obedience
and rigid conformity were not present to
the same extent as in our more rapidly moving
civilization. Thus the tradition of absolute obedience
of child to parent remained practically intact.
Wherever this tradition existed the usual[153]
method of enforcement was corporal punishment,
generally inflicted with a strap. It is not intended
to assert that a great deal of child beating was
prevalent in the old country; in most cases the
child learned quickly that the penalty of disobedience
was the strap, and threats became as
effective as its actual use.


BREAKDOWN OF PARENTAL AUTHORITY

The immigrant brings with him to this country
this tradition of the authority of the parent, with
no thought of doing anything but maintaining
it here. There are, however, forces at work in
this country that tend to make this impossible.
There are suggestions of a different tradition in
the general atmosphere. Many immigrants absorb
these suggestions unconsciously, as they absorb
those of a wider freedom for women. More
important, however, is the development of the
child. Circumstances of his daily life force him
to take the lead in many situations. This has
been pointed out in a study of the delinquent
child, where it is said:[44]

Obviously, many things which are familiar to the child
in the facts of daily intercourse in the street, or in the
school, will remain unknown or unintelligible to the father
and mother. It has become a commonplace that this cheap
wisdom on the part of the boy or girl leads to a reversal of
the usual relationship between parent and child. The child[154]
who knows English is the interpreter who makes the necessary
explanations for the mother to the landlord, the grocer,
the sanitary inspector, the charity visitor, and the teacher
or truant officer. It is the child again who often interviews
the "boss," finds the father a job, and sees him through
the onerous task of "joining the union." The father and
mother grow accustomed to trusting the child's version of
what "they all do in America," and gradually find themselves
at a great disadvantage in trying to maintain parental
control.

In the face of this situation the conduct of the
immigrant parent generally follows along one of
three very distinct lines: (a) he modifies his
methods in family discipline little by little, himself
unconscious of the implications, or (b) he
stubbornly attempts to retain the old authority
undiminished, or (c) he abandons the old system
without having anything to put in its place. The
first method of behavior is probably the most
common; it usually leads to little difficulty
within the family group if the parents' modifications
are made as fast as the child becomes aware
of the newer ideas. The attempt to maintain the
old system in its entirety may also be accomplished
without disturbance if the child is willing,
and probably in most cases it is maintained
without serious opposition on the part of the
child.

Abandoning the old system without substituting
something better is probably the least frequent
reaction to the situation, but it is one that[155]
is especially dangerous in immigrant groups.
The native-born parent who relaxes all discipline
has this advantage over the foreign born; in
general he can at will demonstrate his superior
knowledge, and the child looks up to him and
takes his advice, while the foreign-born parent is
peculiarly helpless because the child thinks that
his own knowledge, demonstrably superior in
some things, extends to all fields.

The relative frequency of these different modes
of reaction would be a difficult matter to determine.
They were all evident from the facts
about discipline obtained from the families visited
in this study. To some extent the maintenance
of the old system intact may be judged by the
prevalence of corporal punishment as a method
of enforcing obedience.

A doctor of a Lithuanian district said that one
thing he was very anxious to see disappear was
the strap, which could now be seen in almost
every home. Fifty-four of the eighty-seven families
from whom information was obtained said
that they used whipping as a method of punishment.
In most of the cases there was nothing
to indicate with what the child was whipped,
but in five it was definitely stated that a strap
was used. In very few cases was there any
attempt to punish the child in private. It was
usually stated that the whipping was done before
all the other members of the family. Two or[156]
three families stated that they did not whip the
children on the street.

A significant fact was the frequently repeated
assertion that the children were whipped because
they were too young to understand anything
else. An interesting state of transition was seen
in some of the thirty-three families who had
abandoned whipping but had not given up the
idea of absolute obedience. It is evidenced in
comments like the following: "They are not
whipped. Father threatens with a strap." Or,
"It [whipping] is not necessary. Father speaks,
and children obey." Some families had relaxed
the discipline sufficiently to be apparent to our
investigators, who made such comments as "Children
are making a terrible noise, but nobody
seemed to mind."

It has already been said that whatever the reaction,
the training of the children usually takes
place without visible disaster to the family group.
This is especially true while the children are
young. As they grow older the dangers that are
inherent in such a situation become more marked.
The figures on juvenile delinquency show that
an unduly large proportion of juvenile offenders
are children of foreign-born parents. This subject
will be discussed more fully at a later point
in the chapter in connection with the problem
of the older boy and girl. It is important to
emphasize here that the foundation for later[157]
trouble is often laid while the children are young,
and hence consideration of the effect of modern
ideas on discipline and training should begin
with the very young child.


LEARNING TO PLAY

One of the needs of the growing child that is
much emphasized in modern ideas of child culture
is an opportunity for wholesome play. The
foreign-born mother, from a rural district in Europe,
where children were put to work helping
the parents as soon as they could be in any way
useful, frequently does not recognize this need,
and hence does not even do those things within
her power to secure it. From some opportunities
which she and the children might enjoy together,
she is cut off by lack of knowledge of
English. A Bohemian woman, for example, said
that she did not go with her husband and the
children to the moving pictures, as she could not
read the English explanations and often did not
understand the pictures.

Even when the need is recognized it is still a
very difficult problem. In the old country, when
the child was too little to work, he could play in
the fields quite safe, in sight of his mother at
her work. In the city, however, especially in the
congested districts, which are the only ones
known to immigrants when they first come, the
child cannot play in his own yard, for there is[158]
nothing that can be called a yard. The alternatives
are the city streets with their manifold
dangers, or the public playground. From the
point of view of physical safety as well as in giving
a place for more wholesome play, the public
playground is obviously the more desirable.

The provision of playgrounds, however, is
everywhere inadequate, in some places much
more so than in others. In Chicago, which is
probably better equipped in this respect than
most cities, there are large districts that have
no easy access to a playground. Many of the
women that were asked where their children
played said that they played on the streets, not
because the parents thought it safe, but because
they could not go to a playground alone and the
mother had not time to take them. It was interesting,
too, to learn that some of the parents
who preferred the playground, and whose children
played there, did not think the children
should be left there alone. In one Bohemian
family the grandmother took the two little boys
to the playground and stayed with them as long
as they stayed.

In part, then, the problem of play space is a
problem in housing reform. All the newer housing
projects make provision for a space for this
purpose, either by the individual yard or where
the multiple house is used, by one playground
for every three or four families. Housing reform,[159]
however, comes slowly and immediate relief could
be given by the provision of many more public
playgrounds. It is obvious that these must be
so directed and supervised that children can be
left with perfect safety.

It would also be necessary to see that the
foreign-speaking mothers were informed of the
advantages of the playground and convinced of
its safety for their children. The supervision of
children's play in streets and vacant lots could
be greatly extended. The establishing during
certain hours of "play zones," from which traffic
is excluded and in which the younger children
and their mothers could be taught simple games
and dances, has been found successful.


PARENTS AND EDUCATION

In the matter of education the state has relieved
the parent of a large part of the responsibility
by legislation prescribing the ages during which
the child must attend school, and in some states
the grade he must reach before leaving school.
In spite of this there still rests with the parent
the responsibility of choosing the school, getting
the child to school promptly and regularly, following
his progress, deciding whether he shall go
beyond the time prescribed by law.

The choice of the schools means for most immigrant
groups, a choice between the public and
the parochial school. In very large numbers of[160]
cases the parochial school is chosen. The reason
for this is only in part the influence of the church,
although this undoubtedly counts for a great
deal. The people we have interviewed in this
study have repeatedly pointed out that it is not
only for religious education and training that
the foreign-born parent sends his child to the
parochial school, but that it is also because he
wants him to learn the language of his parents,
the history and traditions of the country from
which he came, and to retain a respect for the experiences
and associations that remain of great
importance to the parents.

Another reason that has often been given for
sending the children to the parochial school is
the lack of discipline in the public schools. This
has been especially emphasized by Italians, but
it has also been spoken of by members of other
groups. There can be no question that the
parochial school, under the tradition of authority
maintained by the church, is much nearer in its
idea of discipline to the ideas the immigrant
brings with him from the old country, than is
the public school whose system of training the
immigrant parent does not understand and has
not had made clear to him.



IMMIGRANT CHILDREN ACQUIRING INDIVIDUAL INITIATIVE IN A MONTESSORI CLASS AT HULL HOUSE


The problem of the immigrant parent with regard
to the education of his child is more difficult
because of the change in the position of the
child in this country, which he usually does not[161]
understand. At home the child was important,
not as an individual, but as a member of the
family group, and home decisions about the child
took into account the needs of the family in the
first place and only secondarily the welfare of
the child.[45]

This reversal of emphasis is confusing to the
immigrant parents. Taken in connection with
the fact that many of the immigrants are from
countries where education is not compulsory, it
leads them to sacrifice the welfare of the child
at many points. It seems of much greater importance,
for example, that the work of the
household should be done than the child should
get to school every day. The study of the reasons
for absence in two of the immigrant neighborhoods
of Chicago[46] shows the frequency with
which children are kept out of school because of
the needs of the family. Thus, of 1,115 children
who were absent from school during a certain
period 131 were out to do work at home; 81 were
kept at home because of sickness in the family;
42 stayed home to interpret or run errands.

One boy, for example, was kept to watch fires
for a sick father while his mother "got a day's
work"; another had stayed at home because his
sister's baby was in convulsions and his mother
[162]had not been able to get him ready to go to
school; John was staying at home because his
mother had gone to see a doctor and wanted him
to look after the children, who did not like to
go to the day nursery; Bruno, aged twelve, was
found at home helping his mother wash, but he
explained that he had really stayed out to go
"to tell the boss" that his father was sick; Genevieve,
aged twelve, who had been absent fourteen
half days and tardy twice within a month,
was found alternately tending the shop and taking
care of three younger children and of a sick
mother, although her father was well able to hire
some one to come in and help care for the family
while the little girl was at school.

In the rural districts the failure to understand
the necessity of complying with the compulsory
education law is even more marked. In the
Rolling Prairie group of Polish families many of
the children were not sent to school until after
two families had been fined for not sending them.
There was the expense for clothes and books,
and the extra work for the mother. The roads
were bad, the children often had no shoes, even
in winter, and, above all, the parents had no
understanding of why they should go. After
the prosecution, however, the school law was
obeyed.

The parents' attitude toward the problem
of keeping the child in school comes out quite[163]
naïvely in the answers given to visitors for this
study. The following comments, given in the
quaint but forceful English of our foreign-speaking
investigators, show what is meant:

Mother (a Russian woman with three children) visited
school when teacher demanded her to send daughter to
school when she wished her at home to help.

Mother (a Polish woman with six children under fourteen)
feels that children study too much and ought to help
their parents more.

Father (Italian) thinks there should be laws for protection
of parents as well as child labor.


FOLLOWING SCHOOL PROGRESS

Following the child's progress at school is a difficult
matter for parents who themselves have not
had the benefit of education, or even for those
who have been educated under a different system.
It is, however, not impossible for them to
do so; by means of reports in the language they
can understand, by talking to the teachers or
some one of the school authorities who knows
about the child's work, they can keep closely
enough in touch with his school record to enable
them to give help at the point where it is most
needed.

Many of them do this in spite of the inherent
difficulties and in spite of difficulties which the
school itself puts in their way. An Italian father
in a little Illinois mining town brought out with
pride the last report of his little girl and showed[164]
the visitor that she had an average of 90 per
cent. In the families studied in Chicago a few
were evidently trying to keep in touch with their
children's schooling. Thus of one family it is
said:

"Mother not only goes to school entertainments,
but follows up the children's work with
the teachers, consults them, and accepts their
advice." This family is Bohemian, and both
mother and father are well-educated leaders in
progressive Bohemian circles in Chicago.

In another Bohemian family the parents were
also making an effort in this direction, but, being
less well equipped, their difficulties were greater.
The schedule says:

Mother never visits school as she cannot understand
English. Parents are very much concerned about their boy
who brought a poor mark from school. After family consultation,
daughter visited teacher, who advised them to
take the boy out of Bohemian school (a nationalistic school
to which he went after school hours), because he might be
overworked.

These are, however, exceptional cases in the
families studied. Among the Bohemians and
Slovaks, to be sure, a considerable proportion of
the mothers visited the school occasionally or
knew some of the children's teachers. Among
the families of the more recent immigrants it
was almost unheard of for the parents to visit
the school. Of the eleven Russian families[165]
studied not one reported any visits to the school
or contact with the teachers, and only two of
the Ukrainian families. One of these visited
only when the children did not behave. This
mother said that she thought she should know
more about her children's school work, but that
she had felt so much in the way when she visited
the school that she finally stopped going.

An almost inevitable consequence of this failure
to make contacts with the school is that the
parents remain quite unaware of what their
children are learning there. An attempt was
made in our study of selected families to get the
parents' opinion of the work the children were
given at school, but very few parents felt they
knew enough about the work to express an opinion.
A few to whom reference has already been
made thought the children gave too much time
to study and not enough to helping their parents,
one or two spoke of the lack of discipline, a few
others thought the schooling must be all right
as the children learned to speak English. A
Ukrainian mother of two children, the oldest
eight, "believes that it must be good, for the
children speak English and the oldest girl can
read and write."

Sometimes the failure to understand what the
children are doing brings unnecessary worry. A
Hungarian mother, speaking of the education
of her children, expressed regret that they were[166]
not taught carpentry. The visitor turned to the
eleven-year-old boy and asked him if he didn't
have manual training. He replied that he did,
but "she doesn't understand."

A careful study of the answers to the questions
in our attempt to get parents' attitude toward
the children's schooling shows, then, that while
a few exceptional parents have been able to follow
their children's schooling, the great majority
of them have not. It suggests that some of them
are willing and ready to do it if only some of the
obstacles were removed, and that there are also
a large number who do not realize the necessity
of it, and for whom something more must be
done. The opportunity of the school, and various
devices for rendering aid at this point, that have
been tried, will be discussed in a later chapter.

The failure of the parents to understand not
only means confusion and worry for them, but
for the child lack of the help and sympathy at
home that they might have. It becomes more
serious as the child reaches the age when he is
no longer compelled by law to attend school, and
the decision as to whether or not he shall go on
rests with his parents. When the parents have
not known about the work he has been doing, and
have no means of judging how much or how little
he has learned, they are obviously in no position
to make a decision about his further education.

There are many forces at work to influence[167]
the immigrant parent to put the child to work
at once. There is, first of all, in many cases, economic
pressure. Sometimes the child's earnings
are actually needed to make up the family budget
for current expenditures. In some families,
however, his earnings are not so much needed
as desired, to help in buying property more often
than for any other reason. In these cases it
seems clear that the attitude toward the child
as a means of contributing to the welfare or
prestige of the family is a very important factor.
One Polish doctor with whom we conferred emphasized
this point. He said that the Polish
parent expected to stop work at an early age
and live on the earnings of his children. Hence
he took his children out of school as soon as the
law allowed, and had them start work.

Another factor that undoubtedly plays an important
part is the parent's own lack of education.
Never having had any opportunity for
more than the most elementary education, it is
only natural that it should seem that a child
who had spent seven years in school should be
fairly well educated. This attitude is strengthened
if he has succeeded without education or
if the people whom he looks upon as successful
have had little education. He is further confirmed
in this attitude very often by his failure
to realize the extent of the change in conditions
and the ever-increasing complexity of the situation[168]
with which his child will have to deal. Thus
he often fails to understand that an education
that was quite adequate for the simple life in the
old country is far from sufficient for life in this
country to-day.

Some of the people with whom we conferred
were of the opinion that many of the parents
from groups oppressed in Europe failed to realize
the full significance of the freedom here.
There the higher positions and the professions
had been closed to them on account of race or
class, and many of them were not aware that here
they would be open to their children if they could
give them the necessary education and training.

There are, fortunately, forces at work to counteract
this tendency to take the children out of
school at the earliest possible moment. There
is, too, among the foreign born, a very general
desire to have their children do office work
rather than manual labor, and an understanding
that this means more than a grammar-school
education. There is a certain naïve faith in the
benefits of education even though they are not
understood. This is particularly strong in people
to whom the schools have been closed by a dominant
race in Europe&mdash;the Jews from Russia, for
example. And in proportion as the parents become
educated so that they feel their own limitations,
they appreciate education for their children
and strive to give it to them. There is no[169]
doubt that all these influences are felt in the
foreign-born groups, but they win out gradually
against the force of the traditions by which the
parent is guided in his decision to take the child
out of school.

The American community could hasten their
action by helping the foreign-born parents to
understand. There have been some attempts to
enlighten the parents. The work of the Vocational
Guidance Bureau in Chicago should be
mentioned in this connection. When a child
wants to leave school to go to work they explain
to the parents the importance of keeping the
child in school, and suggest means by which
this can be done. This happens, however, only
after the decision and plans have been made to
put the child to work. The bureau has been
handicapped in dealing with foreign-born parents
by its lack of foreign-speaking visitors.

An attempt of a different order has been made
to reach the Bohemian farmers in Nebraska. A
professor in the state university has for a number
of years gone out to these farming communities,
urging in public speeches given in Bohemian
the necessity of higher education for the children,
and especially for the girls.


THE REVOLT OF OLDER CHILDREN

The problem of the older boy and girl is by far
the most difficult of the parents' problems. Reference[170]
has already been made to the fact that
it is as the child grows older that the difficulties
of maintaining the old system of parental authority
become more apparent. It is at this time
that the child sees that system is out of date, and
then, if ever, he rebels against it. There is considerable
evidence that the parents, on the other
hand, feel the importance of maintaining their
authority at that period of the child's life more
than at any other. There are several reasons
for this, among the more important being the
fact that the child has reached an age when
he can be economically helpful to the family
group, and that the parents see dangers in
his path. In other words, the maintenance of
parental authority seems to be tied up with
the control of the child's earnings and the
maintenance of certain conventions regarding
the association between young people of different
sexes.[47]

The immigrant parent very generally asserts
his legal right to the entire earnings of his minor
child. In fact, the child often continues the practice
of giving up his wages until his marriage.
Out of forty-three families studied, in which
there were children of working age, thirty-five
parents took the entire earnings of the children.
The amount that the parent should give back
to the child is not fixed by law or by custom, and
[171]it is at this point that conflict between the child
and the parents is likely to arise.

The parents frequently expect to continue to
provide for the boy and the girl of working age
as they did when they were younger, and to
recognize their maturity only by giving them
small sums weekly for spending money. In the
case of girls even this slight concession is not
made, and the girl has to ask her mother for
everything she wants. In only four of the thirty-five
families in which the children turned in all
their earnings was an allowance of as much as
$3 a week given. In the others the working child
was given 25 cents, 50 cents, or 75 cents a week,
usually on Sunday, or was given no fixed sum
but "what he needs." In a Slovak family a girl
of sixteen earning $13 a week, and one of fourteen
earning $9 a week, were each given 50 cents
each pay day; a boy of fifteen in a Slovenian
family, earning $15 a week, received 50 cents
on Sunday; two Slovak girls of eighteen and
sixteen years, earning $45 and $80 a month,
turned in all their earnings and got back "what
they asked for."

It is not surprising that a boy or girl should
chafe under the system even if the resentment
stopped short of open rebellion. In the families
studied in which there was no evidence of friction
it seems to have been avoided either by
such a firm establishment of the authority of[172]
the parents while the child was young, that the
child had not yet questioned it, or by wise use
of the child's earnings for the benefit of the
child. In several instances it was reported that
they gave the child "all she asks"; one girl was
being given lessons on the violin, which she specially
desired. In these cases the issue did not
appear to have been raised, but we have no
reason for thinking the children were satisfied
with the arrangement.

In other families the beginnings of friction
could already be seen. A Russian woman said
that her two working girls, aged seventeen and
fourteen, did not need money, and in the presence
of the investigator refused the request of
one for money for a picture show, telling her
that men would pay her way. The eight parents
who did not take all their children's earnings
had not all changed their practices voluntarily.
In some cases it was done because the children
refused any longer to turn their earnings in.

When the parent takes the entire earnings of
the child and continues to bear the burden of
support, there is probably no question on which
the ideas of the child and those of the parent are
so likely to conflict as on the question of clothes,
especially clothes for the girl. The chaotic and
unstandardized condition of the whole clothing
problem has been pointed out in an earlier chapter,
and attention has been called to the fact[173]
that it is one of the causes of conflict between
parent and child.

It is only natural that the young girl should
want to look as well as possible, and it is to be
expected that the girl of foreign-born parents
should quickly learn at school or at work the
prevailing opinion that to be well dressed is to
be dressed in the latest fashion. She is also in a
position to observe how quickly the fashions
change, and thus early learns the unimportance
of quality in modern clothing. She undoubtedly
underestimates its importance because her models
are not those on display at the highest-grade department
stores, where the beauty of the quality
occasionally redeems in slight measure the grotesqueness
of form; she sees only the cheap imitations
displayed in the stores in her own neighborhood.

In her main contention that if she is to keep
up with the fashions she need not buy clothing
that will last more than one season, she is probably
right. It is natural also that this method of
buying should be distressing to her mother, who
has been accustomed to clothes of unchanging
fashions which were judged entirely by their
quality. When to her normal distress at buying
goods of poor quality at any price there is added
an outrage to her native thrift, because the price
of these tawdry fashionable goods is actually
greater than for goods of better quality, it is not[174]
surprising that she and her daughter should clash
on the question of what to buy.

The question of shoes is said to be a special
point of conflict. The girls insist on costly high-heeled,
light-colored boots, while the mother sees
that she could buy at less than half the price
better shoes, more sensible, and of better quality.
The conflict is more acute in proportion as the
mother has lived an isolated life in this country
and has not herself tried to keep up with American
fashions. It is interesting to note that workers
in the Vocational Guidance Bureau in Chicago
state that this desire of the girls for expensive
clothes is a leading motive in causing them to
leave school to go to work.


RELATIONS OF BOYS AND GIRLS

The most serious of the problems in connection
with the older boy and girl is that of the relations
between the sexes. In the old country the situation
was much more easily defined. The conventions
were fixed, and had changed very little
since the mother was young. In Italy, for example,
daughters never went out with young men,
not even after they were engaged. The same is
said to be true in most of the other countries
from which our immigrants have come. In Croatia,
Serbia, and Bohemia it is unheard of for a
young woman to go out alone with a young man.

Moreover, coming as so many of these people[175]
do from small villages or rural communities, they
have been used to a single-group life which is
impossible in a city. As one Italian woman has
expressed it, work and recreation went hand in
hand in the old country. During the day there
was the work of both men and women in the
fields in congenial groups, and in the evenings
songs and dancing in the village streets. The
whole family worked and played together with
other family groups.

It is not intended to assert that there were no
problems with young people in the old country,
for undoubtedly there, as everywhere, some of
the young would be wayward and indifferent to
the conventions. The point is that there the
mother knew what standards she was to maintain
and had, moreover, the backing of a homogeneous
group to help her. In this country not
only is she herself a stranger, uncertain of herself,
not sure whether to try to maintain the
standards of her home or those that seem to
prevail here, but the community of which she is
a part is far from being a homogeneous group
and has apparently conflicting standards. The
immigrant mother, then, has to decide in the
first place what standards she will try to maintain.

The old standards can scarcely be maintained
in a modern community where the girls go to
work in factories, working side by side with men,
going and coming home in the company of men.[176]
It is manifestly impossible for the mother to
watch her daughter at work. In the old country
this was possible as long as she stayed on the
farm. And when at school and at work she is
constantly thrown with men, it is impossible to
regulate her social hours by the old standards
and to see that they are all spent under her
mother's eye. Moreover, any attempt to do so
is likely to provoke resentment, as a girl naturally
thinks that if she can take care of herself
at work she is equally well able to do so at
play.

Furthermore, the character of the recreation
has undergone almost as great a change as the
character of the work. With the change from the
country to the city, it has already been suggested
that the old group life with its simple pleasures,
which the whole family shared, has become
impossible. If the mother then tries to see that
her daughter has social life in which she herself
may share, she either cuts her off from most of
the normal pleasures of young people of her age,
or the mother finds herself in places where she is
not wanted, and where no provision has been
made for her entertainment.

Most immigrant parents, except those from
southern Italy, recognize the impossibility of
maintaining the old rules of chaperonage and
guardianship of the girls. One of the Slovak
women with whom we conferred said that in all[177]
her circle of acquaintance there was only one
mother who was attempting to bring her daughter
up by the old standards and was not allowing
her to go places in the evening where the mother
might not accompany her. All the others were
allowing their daughters more freedom than they
thought desirable, but they did not know what
else to do.

The Italian parents, on the other hand, try to
guard their girls almost as closely as they did in
Italy. It is not especially to be wondered at,
for what the immigrant father or mother sees is
usually the worst in American city life. If the
daughter could not be trusted alone or unchaperoned
in a village in which they knew most of the
people and all the places of amusement, is she
any more safe in a city in which, as one foreign-born
mother says, "You don't know what is
around the corner from you"?

Moreover, realizing only the danger to the girl,
and not being able in his ignorance to explain to
her or to protect her in any other way, the father
often resorts to beating the girl to enforce the
obedience which generations have taught him is
due to him. The head of the Complaint Department
of the Cook County Juvenile Court in
Chicago said that while cases of immorality
were very rare among Italian girls, the attention
of the court was called to a great many who rebelled
at this attempt at seclusion and ran away[178]
from home, often contracting hasty and ill-advised
marriages.

While most parents of other nationalities see
that the old standards cannot be maintained,
there is a great deal of confusion as to what
standards are to be considered right. This is
illustrated by the following incident. A very intelligent
Jugo-Slav woman, in discussing the
problem, said that she did not know what she
would do in her own family, as she hated to
think of her girls adopting American standards.
The matter had been brought to her attention
recently by the conduct of two girls with a young
Serbian officer who was visiting in this country.
As he walked up one of the boulevards two girls,
who were utter strangers to him, had flourished
small feather dusters in his face by way of salutation.
This woman was very much surprised
to hear that the investigator disapproved of this;
she had supposed it was just our "American
freedom."

As long as the mother does not understand this
tradition of freedom between the sexes nor realize
its limits, it is natural that she should accept
her daughter's dictum that everything she wants
to do is "American" and that it is hopeless for
the mother to try to understand. In many of
the families visited in this study it was evident
that the mother had completely given up trying
to understand either the conditions under which[179]
her children work or how they get their recreation.
One mother, for example, said that she
knew where her daughter worked when it was a
well-known place, but otherwise not. Another
said that her children told her where they worked,
but she never remembered the names, for she
knew that they would mean nothing to her.

Several said they did not try to advise their
children about their work, because they knew they
didn't understand. One Russian mother was
very much worried about the future of her two
boys, aged seventeen and thirteen. The older
was working as a cash boy, earning twelve dollars
a week, and the younger was working outside
of school hours, sewing caps. The mother
said that their father had learned one trade and
followed that, but that her children changed work
every two or three months. She seldom asked
why they changed, because she did not understand
conditions in Chicago.

Most of the women confessed to being equally
at sea with regard to their children's amusements.
Some of them accepted with resignation the fact
that they could not understand, saying, as one
woman did, that she thought they had too much
freedom, but that young people lived very differently
here. Some of the mothers, on the other
hand, while thinking that young people in general
had too much freedom, thought that they
did not need worry about their own children,[180]
because they had been able to make companions
of their daughters. A few even were found who
approved of the freedom allowed to young people,
but thought children should be taught "more
morality."

It is scarcely possible to say too much of the
failure of the American community to assist the
immigrant family at this point. It has neither
tried to make the fathers and mothers understand
modern American ways, nor has it exercised
any community supervision so that the
girl is in reality safe at work and at play. Furthermore,
some of the agencies from whom the
most help might have been expected have deliberately
passed over the mother to educate the
child, hastening the process by which the child
becomes Americanized in advance of his parents.

The Church has had its share, as may be seen
from the statement of one priest who holds a
responsible position in the Church in Chicago.
He believes that the parents are usually too advanced
in years to assimilate or utilize whatever
instruction is given them. In his opinion the
ignorance of the parent is responsible for many
bad tendencies in the children, but the difficulty
can be corrected more surely and satisfactorily
by dealing directly with the children.

The attitude of the public schools is illustrated
by an interview with the principal of a public
school in an immigrant neighborhood. He says[181]
that his contact has been only with the children.
The foreign-born parents of the first generation
are, in his opinion, "so incorrigibly stupid" that
any attempts to educate them are a waste of
time. The only possible way, he thinks, of reaching
the parents is through the children.


THE JUVENILE COURT

We should not expect the Juvenile Court, dealing
as directly as it does with problems resulting from
the breakdown of family discipline, to be itself
a cause of breakdown. Nevertheless, interviews
with court officers show a certain lack of understanding
and the use of methods which, instead
of relieving the situation, only aggravate it.
When the case of a delinquent girl, for instance,
comes to court, the officers believe that it has
usually gone too far for the court to do anything
with the family. The child is often placed out
in a family home, always an American family;
and the probation officer supervises the child and
the foster home, but pays no attention to the
child's own home, where younger children may
be growing up in the same way and to which,
ultimately, the delinquent girl should be allowed
and encouraged to return.

The probation officers know very little of the
old-country background of the people with which
they deal, and are often not clear as to the differences
in nationality. The foreign-born parent's[182]
ignorance of laws and customs, and his inability
to speak English, make him appear stupid
to the officer. As a result, he may be ignored as
quite hopeless.

In the absence of the court interpreter the child
may be called upon to interpret to the parent
the whole proceedings in court. While this is
less common now than it was a few years ago,
there is no reason to believe that the child is
less used as interpreter between the probation
officer and the parent at home.

From the records of the court proceedings it is
often quite evident to the reader that the foreign-born
parent has little idea of the reasons why he
or his child should have been brought to court.
In one Bohemian family studied the eldest boy,
aged sixteen, was in the State School for Delinquent
Boys. The parents seemed utterly unaware
of the serious nature of the boy's offenses
and of the blot on his record. They seemed to
regard the school for delinquents somewhat as
more prosperous parents are wont to regard the
boarding school. In fact, they expressed regret
that the boy was soon to be released. Yet this
boy had been in the Juvenile Court three times;
the first time for truancy, and the other two for
stealing.

The attention of the community is usually
called to the difficulties of the foreign-born parents
only when a complete breakdown occurs, resulting[183]
in juvenile delinquency. This result is,
however, comparatively rare. Most families work
their way through without getting into a situation
that calls public attention to their family affairs.
There is no question, however, that there is often
a lack of harmony in the home. Sometimes the
child of working age leaves home, to board perhaps
in the same neighborhood or to contract
a hasty marriage.

Occasionally there are situations in which the
ordinary relations of parent and child have been
completely reversed, and the children have assumed
responsibility for the management of the
home and the family. For instance, the Juvenile
Court was asked by the neighbors to investigate
conditions in a Polish family, in which a six-year-old
boy was said to be neglected. The investigation
showed no real neglect from the point of
view of the court, but a situation that needed
supervision.

The mother was a widow and had, besides the
six-year-old boy, two daughters aged seventeen
and nineteen. Both girls were born in Austria.
The father had preceded his family to the United
States, and for five years the mother had worked
and supported herself and the children in the
old country before he was able to send for them.
He seems not to have had a very good moral
influence over the children, but had been dead
several years. The daughters were both supporting[184]
the mother, who was doing one or two
days' work a week. The daughters turned over
all their earnings to the mother, but said that
she was a poor manager and never had anything
to show for it. They themselves had
managed to buy new furniture and clothes for
themselves. They said they were ashamed to
go out with their mother, who remained unprogressive,
would not dress as they liked, and
would not manage the home as they wished.
The girls told the officer that they did not take
her out with them, but gave her money to go
to the "movies." Yet she would do nothing
but sit at home and cry.

At one time the boy was accused of stealing
coal from a neighbor. The oldest girl wanted
her mother to investigate, but the mother would
not go near any of her American neighbors. The
daughter herself found out that the child had
really taken the coal from a neighbor, and
whipped him. Gradually the daughters, especially
the older one, have assumed entire control
of the family. The mother can no longer
discipline even the six-year-old boy. Since the
daughter has undertaken to correct him, he pays
no attention at all to his mother. The probation
officer has tried to restore a more normal family
relationship, and has tried to help the girls to
understand their mother's position. She still
speaks with pride of the five years in the old[185]
country when she supported them alone, and
when she was really of some use to them.

The older daughter threatened for some time
to leave home if her mother could not be more
agreeable. When the court officer remonstrated,
she said that of course she would leave her furniture,
and could not be convinced that that
would not entirely compensate. Later she did
leave home, and took some of her furniture.
The family are Catholics, but the mother no longer
goes to church, and, though the girls go, the priest
seems to have had no influence over them.

Although the great majority of the foreign-born
parents succeed in bringing up their children
without the children becoming delinquent,
the minority who are not successful is large
enough to cause grave concern. This has been
shown in all figures in juvenile delinquency. A
study of delinquent children before the Cook
County Juvenile Court shows that 72.8 per cent
of the 14,183 children brought to the court between
July 1, 1899, and June 30, 1909, had foreign-born
parents.[48] A special study of 584 of
these, who were delinquent boys, showed 66.9
per cent with foreign-born parents.[49] A comparison
of the nativity of the parents of children in
the Juvenile Court with the proportion of each
group in the married population of Chicago indicates
[186]that the number of parents of delinquent
children in the foreign-born group is disproportionately
large. That is, the foreign born form
57 per cent of the married population of Chicago,
while "at least 67 per cent of the parents of delinquent
boys of the court were foreign born,
and there is reason to believe that the true percentage
is above 67."[50]

This preponderance of children from immigrant
homes must not be taken to mean that
children of foreign-born parents are naturally
worse than the children of American parents. It
confirms the fact that immigrant parents have
special difficulties in bringing up their children
and are in need of special assistance. It suggests
very forcibly the danger to the community in
continuing to ignore their special needs.



[187]

VII

IMMIGRANT ORGANIZATIONS AND FAMILY
PROBLEMS


In the former chapters an attempt has been made
to set out some of the difficulties encountered by
foreign-born families who attempt to establish
themselves in the United States. The discussion
has dealt with the problem as though the community
were one factor and the immigrant family
another factor, and as though the solution to
be arrived at could be discovered by bringing
them into new relations to each other. This
treatment is justified, in view of the fact that
even a slight analysis makes it clear that certain
modifications in governmental and social machinery
are highly desirable. When the limitations
imposed by the war on freedom of migration
have been removed, the possibility of dealing
more wisely and more humanely with incoming
family groups must be considered.

In a very real sense, during any period when
the volume of immigration is considerable, the
community is one factor and the immigrant is
another factor, and a partial solution is to be[188]
found in a new treatment of the relationships
between these two. But in another sense the
discussion is inadequate and perhaps misleading.
The relationship between the community and
the immigrant is not mechanical, but organic.
So soon as he is admitted, he is in fact a part of
the community, and what will be done, what can
be done, depends in part at least upon the extent
to which that relationship is developed. The
currents of the community life must flow through
and both enrich and be enriched by the life of
the newcomer. If these currents are obstructed,
he neither shares nor contributes as he might.

These channels of intercourse, however, have
often been so obstructed that contacts have been
denied. That segregation and separation have
characterized the life of many of the groups for
considerable periods of time has become a commonplace,
and it has been generally known that
the life of these different foreign-born groups
was separate from the general life of the community,
and the life of one group separate from
the life of other groups. But the fact that within
these separate groups was developed often a fairly
rich and highly organized life has not been so
widely recognized.


SAFETY IN RACIAL AFFILIATIONS

During the war, for example, the community became
aware of the fact that within these national[189]
groups there had developed more or less powerful
and efficient organizations formerly active in behalf
of political interests in the old country,
capable, at least, of fostering a spirit of clannishness,
of perpetuating the language, customs, and
ideals of an alien population in the midst of
American life, and of keeping alive in this country
national and racial antipathies brought from
Europe. Leaders in the European struggle came
to these groups and obtained pecuniary support
and political adherence. Recruiting for military
service among the foreign born was successfully
carried on.

Leaders of active societies among the different
Slavic groups have stated quite freely that
a spirit of unity and of nationality has been
consciously fostered in America by these societies,
so that, when the time came for the oppressed
nation to strike for freedom in the European
struggle, the representatives of the race in
this country might stand solidly behind such
efforts. It is impossible, after the exhibition of
the generous support given among foreign-born
groups during the war to the efforts of the United
States, to raise the question of their loyalty; but
their separateness has been far greater, their exclusion
from many community efforts and activities
far more complete, than the leaders among
them had realized.

The leaders among the foreign born do not[190]
wholly blame the leaders of the "American"
group; they seem to feel that immigrants who
came at an earlier date are in part to blame.
These earlier arrivals knew what immigration
meant, and might have been expected to help
open the way for those who came afterward, but
were, in fact, chiefly concerned to get ahead and
to leave old associations behind. This was the
opinion expressed by a Bohemian business man
prominent in both local and national organizations.
He also said that the reason that had in
the past led to the formation and support of these
organizations had ceased to exist; but now that
the European struggle against oppression had
ended for his people, and leaders understood how
separate the life of the foreign-born groups had
been, these very societies could be used to
establish a variety of contacts and to develop
among the foreign born a wider interest in
the United States and its problems. Particularly
the ability to act together learned during
the war should be used to develop effective co-operation.

As the organization of these societies is discussed
in another volume in this series, they will
not be described here, except as they affect the
position of women and so exercise an influence
upon the adjustment of family life.[51]

Possibly the most significant fact revealed in
[191]the course of the study has been the extent to
which foreign-born groups have been inaugurating
and developing educational and social movements,
and establishing institutions and agencies,
quite independent of the Federal, state, or local
agencies at work along the same general lines.
On the other hand, the national educational and
welfare movements carried on by the "American
people" have ignored the organization and leadership
in the foreign-born community. This has
been the case to an amazing extent, even when
the public efforts have been ostensibly based
upon studies of conditions existing in cities
with a population that is largely of foreign
birth.

When no channels of communication between
the immigrant and the larger community seem
to have been established, we have been concerned
to inquire how such channels can be most effectively
created. The barriers that through ignorance,
indifference, and misunderstanding on
either side have been allowed to grow up must
be broken down. We have tried to follow up
such avenues of communication as have opened
naturally before us, after becoming acquainted
with some of the leaders in the different groups.

The organizations with which we have become
somewhat acquainted are representative of the
types found in all the main Slavic groups and
among the Lithuanians, Hungarians, Rumanians,[192]
and Greeks. Suggestions applicable to them indicate
a basis of co-operation with a very large
proportion of our foreign-born population.

A list of the principal racial organizations in
the United States is included in the Appendix.
Information about local branches of these organizations
can usually be secured by correspondence.


LOCAL BENEFIT SOCIETIES

The first incentive to organization among all the
groups seems to have been the precarious economic
situation during the years of effort to get
a foothold here. The first association of the
newly arrived immigrant is one of mutual aid.
"Benefit" will be found as the basis of the important
foreign-born organizations, no matter
what new purposes may have been taken on
with the establishment and progress of the group
as a whole.



WHO WILL WELCOME THEM?


In the interviews we have had with the leaders
among the groups the point has been repeatedly
emphasized that Americans can never appreciate
the situation of immigrants during their first
ten years in this country. The strangeness, the
poverty, the pressure to send money home, the
inadequate, irregular income, the restriction to
the low-skilled job&mdash;"there is in America, at
first, nothing for an immigrant but the shovel"&mdash;the
lack of knowledge of money values and ignorance
of American domestic and social practices&mdash;these[193]
conditions drive the immigrants into
co-operative effort. The appeal sent out by a
Russian national society organized in 1912 begins
with some such words as these:

While we are in this country we are doing the lowest kind
of work, and many accidents happen to us; if we do not
belong to an organization we are without help.... The
purpose of our brotherhood is to help our brethren in a
strange country.

Not even in associated effort can they always
find security, however. One of the reasons now
being given very often by immigrants seeking
passage back to Europe is their feeling of uncertainty
about their future here. They say that
America is all right so long as a man is young
and strong enough to do the hard work in the
industries, but they cannot see what is in store
for them as they grow older, for they cannot
save enough to provide for themselves; in Europe,
a little land and a cottage are assurance
of the necessities for old age.

There are, of course, many cases in which there
is failure within the group as there is neglect
without. Exploitation of immigrants by their
fellow countrymen, and the evils of fraudulent
banks, steamship companies, "tally-men," are
well known. At the same time there is a great
mass of neighborly service and of kindness of
the poor to the poor, and of the stranger to the
more recent comer.[194]

Benefit societies based either on neighborhood
associations here or on village association in Europe,
soon grow up. These are usually self-assessment
societies, in which each member pays
a small sum each month, often only 25 cents.
Out of the funds thus raised, a sick benefit of
from $3 to $5 a week is paid. On the death of a
member an assessment of from 50 cents to $1 is
laid on the surviving members, and the resulting
sum is paid to the bereaved family, helping to
meet the funeral expenses.

Such societies are not incorporated, their officers
are usually without business training, and
they are often unstable. They include, however,
a considerable proportion of the more recent
immigrants, who, through fear of falling into distress
and dread of charity, are influenced to keep
up the membership. In addition to the money
benefit, these neighborhood societies often mean
friendly interest and help in nursing, in the care
of the children, and in household work. As the
fees are low and as provision for the sick benefit
seems very important, a person often belongs to
several such societies.

Owing to the instability of these organizations
the effort is often made to combine them and to
establish them on a sound financial basis as national
fraternal insurance societies. These societies
substitute fraternal insurance for the sick and
death benefit. As the immigrant family gains a[195]
foothold in the new community the members are
likely to join a national fraternal insurance society
or, in the second generation, an organization
of the type of the Catholic Order of Foresters,
Knights and Ladies of Security, Tribe of Ben
Hur, or Woodmen of the World.

The national fraternal insurance society is,
among the Slavs, highly organized. Often in one
national group as many as three flourishing societies
will be found, with membership determined
by religious or political preferences. As they
exist now, these societies are all much alike,
differing in the elaborateness of their organization
in accordance with the period covered
by the immigration of the group or with the
strength of its cohesion in America. Leaders
who wish to communicate directly with the
great body of their co-nationals in America,
do so through the channels provided by these
organizations.

As the group develops a feeling of confidence,
the insurance function becomes less urgent. In
fact, officers of the national societies predict that
the societies will gradually abandon the field of
insurance and develop along other lines. Many
societies already admit a considerable number of
uninsured persons, who join in order to share in
other enterprises. It would be neither possible
nor profitable to describe all the groups, but the
organization of a Croatian society and the relation[196]
of women to certain societies in the Polish
and Lithuanian groups will be briefly discussed.


NATIONAL CROATIAN ORGANIZATIONS

The strongest societies among the Croatians are
the National Croatian Society of 50,000 members,
and the Croatian League of Illinois of 39,000
members, sometimes called the "New Society,"
which in spite of its name is really a national
organization.

The purpose of the National Croatian Society
is set forth in its constitution:

... to help people of the Croatian race residing in
America, in cases of distress, sickness, and death, to educate
and instruct them in the English language and in other
studies to fit them for the duties of life and citizenship with
our English-speaking people, to teach them and impress
upon them the importance and duty of being naturalized
under the laws of the United States, and of educating their
children in the public schools of the country; these purposes
to be carried out through the organization and establishment
of a supreme assembly and subordinate assemblies of
the Croatian people with schools and teachers.

Those eligible to become members are:

Croatians or other Slavs who speak and understand the
Croatian language, of all creeds excepting Jews. All between
the ages of sixteen and fifty may be admitted, provided
they are neither ill nor epileptic nor disabled, are not
living in concubinage, and have not been expelled from the
national society.

The structure of the society is quite elaborate,
and the conditions of admission and of membership,[197]
the organization and conduct of the lodges,
the relations among the lodges and between a
lodge and the national society, are all carefully
specified in the constitution and by-laws.

Lodges are often organized on a sex basis, and
in a community in which there is a lodge for men
and a lodge for women, no one of one sex can be
admitted to the lodge organized for the other.
There is no special notice taken of women's interests
in the structure of the national society,
but there are local women's lodges, and women
constitute about one tenth of the total membership.

The functions of these local lodges, aside from
their official relation to the national organization,
as specified by the by-laws, are:

... to assist those members who do not know how to
read and write (either an officer or member shall, at least
once a week, teach such members reading and writing); to
establish libraries for members and gradually supply the
same with the best and most necessary books; to hold entertainments
with a view to building up the lodge treasury
and to provide for brotherly talk and enjoyment.

The officers and members of some of the local
lodges in Chicago have endeavored to develop
and extend the social and recreational features
of the lodges to meet what they believe to be one
of the greatest needs of their people, but the
efforts have so far met with little success.

Failure has been attributed to conditions found[198]
in the community and to the altered circumstances
of family life in America. It has been
difficult to find suitable meeting places, as Croatian
people have no halls of their own and do
not feel at home in the neighborhood recreation
center. Any kind of recreational activity planned
is, of necessity, so different from that to which
these men and women are accustomed, that it
does not interest them at once. Large families
of small children make it impossible for men and
women to take their recreation together, or for
women to leave their homes at all except for a
very short time.

Leaders whom we have consulted feel, however,
that it is only through the development of
such organizations within the group that Croatian
women can be drawn into any social or
recreational activities in considerable numbers;
for, because they feel peculiarly strange and ill at
ease when with persons who are not of Croatian
origin, they lead secluded lives.

The important projects of the National Croatian
Society have been the raising of funds for
the establishment in each large colony of a
national headquarters under the name Croatian
Home, and for the erection and maintenance of
an invalid home. A "National Fund," into
which each member pays a cent a month, is
created for the "culture and enlightenment of
Croatians." The orphan children of members of[199]
the society are given the preference in the distribution
of any benefit paid from the national
fund.


CARE OF CROATIAN ORPHANS

The Croatian community in the United States
has been peculiarly confronted with the problem
of care of orphan children. The estimated number
of orphan children is large in proportion to
the number of Croatian families because a very
large proportion of the Croatian men work at
low-grade labor in the steel industry, in which
fatal accidents are common.

At the last convention of several of the national
societies, the representatives agreed to form a
new national council especially to undertake the
care of orphan children and to raise funds for
this cause. The plan was formed to buy a tract
of land in the vicinity of Chicago, on which an
orphan home and training school were to be
erected. The sum of $10,000 was devoted to
the site and $100,000 to buildings. As free thinking
has spread rapidly among Croatians in America,
it was intended to establish a nonsectarian
institution and to take children of free-thinking
parents away from the Roman Catholic schools
as well as to provide for children who should be
later orphaned.

Through contacts established in the course of
this study, the leaders in this group have been[200]
led to inquire concerning American methods of
child care. Attention was directed to the latest
standard discussions on the subject.[52] After some
consideration of the method of caring for dependent
children by placing them in family homes,
the Chicago Croatian committee decided to delay
action on the erection of a costly institution,
to take time for further study and to hold a
conference with the national committee representing
the other Croatian societies interested.
In the meantime action has been taken to change
the name of the new national organization from
the "Society for the Erection of a Croatian Orphanage"
to the "Society for the Care of Croatian
Orphans," and the by-laws of the society
are being rewritten so that the movement need
not be committed to institutional care at the
outset, but will be free to choose in the light of
the best information at hand.

Some of the leading members of the committee
are convinced that placing-out should be included
in their plan, but feel that it may take
some time to convince the Croatian people of
this wish to delay operation until the question
can be freely discussed throughout the whole
Croatian community in America. Plans are now
being made for the national committee, representing
[201]all the societies interested, to confer with
the representatives of public and private child-placing
agencies. The question arises as to how
relations may be established between such organizations
in the separate national groups and
those in the American community who are concerned
with improved methods in the care of dependent
children. Until provision is made that
such information will be shared with members of
groups like these as a matter of course, there is
great loss and waste.


ORGANIZATIONS OF POLES

The Polish people are, no doubt, the most highly
organized of the Slavic nationalities. It may be
said that Chicago is their national center in the
United States, and the headquarters of the three
great national fraternal insurance societies, the
Roman Catholic Union of America, the Polish
National Alliance, and the Polish Women's Alliance.
As these organizations are much alike in
general plan, a description of the organization,
character, and methods of work of one will give
an idea of them all.

While these societies have always been divided
upon political issues, and while there has been
at times considerable bitterness in the antagonism
between them, they have been able to unite
their efforts in important undertakings for the
general welfare of the Poles throughout the[202]
United States. Common interest in the Polish
cause during the war, too, has united them as
never before, and there is every reason for the
confident expectation that they will co-operate
in any new projects undertaken for the benefit
of the Polish community in America.

The Polish National Alliance is the largest
single organization. In addition to providing insurance,
this society carries on, through its
national organization, extended work of a social
and educational character.

There is, for example, among its "commissions,"
an Emigration Commission for aiding immigrants,
which is charged with the duty of
framing rules for the proper supervision of homes
established for the care of newcomers. Under
this Commission the Alliance has maintained immigrant
aid stations in New York, Baltimore,
and Boston. In New York there is a home in
which immigrant girls and women arriving alone
may be accommodated until relatives can be
located.

The Chicago office co-operates with the offices
at the ports of entry in securing information
about relatives of Alliance members, and in case
of special necessity arranges to have immigrants
destined for Chicago met at the station. As relatives
are supposed to be notified of the expected
arrival before the women leave New York, the
Chicago office has done little in this direction.[203]
The need for such services, however, has been
made clear in the Annual Reports of the Immigrants'
Protective League, showing the numbers
of unattended Polish girls coming to Chicago to
be much larger than the number in any other
national group.

The Polish National Alliance has been carrying
on a number of projects, both for the Polish
people throughout the country and for the local
community in Chicago. During the war many
forms of work that had been developed for the
service of Poles in the United States were laid
aside for the more urgent needs of the time, and
the funds of this organization were devoted to
the support of the Red Cross and of other relief
work. When the needs especially arising out of
the war have been met and the necessity for
sending relief to Poland is no longer urgent, these
projects, abandoned for the time, will be taken
up again. Polish immigration has for a time
ceased. In the opinion of the Poles in Chicago
it will be very light for years after the war, so
that projects hereafter undertaken will be concerned
with the welfare of the community as it
has become established in the United States.


POLISH WOMEN'S WORK

There is a Women's Department, directed by a
committee of fifteen women members. The central
government frames regulations for this department[204]
"conformably to the requirements of
a given moment." An illustration of its activities
can be found in a movement initiated to
maintain oversight of the employment of Polish
girls and women. A great many Polish girls go
into domestic work in private homes and in hotels
and restaurants. Because girls from the rural
districts in Poland find customs and living conditions
here so different the societies have undertaken
to study the problem. In order to investigate
places of employment the women found
they must represent a regularly licensed employment
agency. Some delay in securing a license
has held up their work, but they plan to establish
in the near future a "Polish Women's Employment
Agency."

Many cases came to their attention showing
the need of protective work and legal aid for
workingwomen, so that in 1917 the "Polish
Women's Protective League" was organized to
provide free legal advice and aid to Polish workingwomen.

The official organ of the Polish National Alliance
is a weekly publication, Zgoda. There is a
daily, the Dziennik Zwaizkowy, that has a semi-official
status. The Women's Department is represented
in the official organ by one page of
ordinary newspaper size, without illustration. In
the daily paper one page each week is devoted to
items of especial value to women. Different[205]
material is used in the two issues, but both give
considerable space to such subjects as household
management, the care of children, and problems
of health and hygiene.

There is, in fact, a marked development among
the Polish, Bohemian, Slovenian, and Lithuanian
groups, of a definite division between the
men's and the women's departments. This began
first in the local lodges as they grew from
mere meetings for the payment of dues into
something more in the order of a center for the
discussion of questions of importance in group
or family life, or for action on those questions.

A woman who, more than eighteen years ago,
organized one of the first lodges in the Polish
National Alliance said that in the lodges of mixed
membership women were supposed to have the
same rights and privileges as men. As a matter
of fact, she said that they had no voice in matters
in which they felt their interest as women were
especially concerned; the women were always
in the minority, and there were very few who
would even voice an opinion in the presence of
men.

The older women in the community came,
therefore, to feel that there were many problems
of vital interest and importance for the immigrant
woman upon which action would never be
taken in the lodge meeting, in which there was a
mixed membership. They believed, too, that the[206]
meetings of the local lodge might become a real
source of help to the newly arrived immigrant
women. The women's lodge was therefore
formed, and to the first meetings came women
who still wore the handkerchiefs over their heads.
Some of the more prosperous members protested
that they did not want such women as these in
the lodge, but the leaders insisted that their
purpose in organizing women's lodges had been
to reach through them just such women. The
leaders felt that women who knew little of American
life and customs would gradually acquire
that knowledge by coming into the lodge.

A lodge of this kind under the leadership of
progressive women of the older immigration has
become a center in which are discussed many of
the questions the women have to face for the first
time. The plan in the Polish National Alliance
is to have lodges so organized that women
from Russian Poland may be in one, those from
Galicia in another, or to organize lodges on the
basis of the neighborhood association in the
United States.

It is hoped that by such a plan as this the more
backward women may be drawn into some of
the social activities of the Polish community.
Although English has not been the language of
the meetings, women have been encouraged to
learn English as soon as possible after their arrival.
The older women urge the younger women[207]
to acquire the language. They have learned the
importance of a knowledge of the language to
the mother of boys and girls who are growing
up in surroundings of which the mother knows
little, and where custom and convention are so
different from those to which she was accustomed.

With the multiplication of women's lodges
came the demand on the part of the women for
representation in the national organization. As
a result, the Women's Auxiliary has been given
an official place, and women have been elected
to the national board of directors.

Polish women have felt that the welfare of the
group as a whole is largely dependent upon the
fitness of the women to meet the new situation.
They have recognized the fact that, because
of the national attitude toward women,
Polish women of the class represented by the
bulk of the immigration are very backward.
They have therefore sought to inaugurate a
campaign for the education of women on a
national scale.

Another interesting development has been the
growth of national organizations for women alone.
One of the earliest and best known of these is the
Polish Women's Alliance, an example of organized
effort of women to deal with their own problems
on a national scale. The leaders in this
enterprise were women who, through their own
experiences as immigrants, and through contact[208]
with those who came later, had come to realize
both the nature of the problems women were
called upon to meet and the different position
of women in America.

One of the women who had been active in inaugurating
the movement spoke of the extreme
difficulty of such work in the Polish community
because of the prejudice against women's taking
part in anything outside of their homes. Some
of the more advanced women thought that the
welfare of the whole Polish community was retarded
by the ignorance and indifference and
prejudices of the women which kept them clinging
to Old-World methods and customs entirely
unsuited to the new conditions. They hoped
that by building a clubhouse for women, with
library and reading rooms, a large hall for assemblies,
and small rooms for clubs and classes, they
might gradually interest the women in something
outside their homes.

No one thought it possible, however, for women
to organize in this way, much less to carry on a
national movement and to build a clubhouse, as
they have succeeded in doing. Some leading
women felt that education must come, if at all,
through the women's own efforts, and that the
education involved in work for the organization
more nearly than any other experience touched
the needs of these women, in that it drew them
out of their older habits and encouraged them to[209]
take the initiative and so to gain the self-confidence
they lacked.

The organization was at first possible only
because of the benefit features through which
the support could be gained of men and women
who had no interest or confidence in such educational
projects as attempt to interest the women
in clean streets, satisfactory disposal of garbage,
and improved housing conditions.

This movement does not represent hostility to
the great joint organization. Most of the women
interested in developing the movement have been
members of the Polish National Alliance; but
they have thought that to give the women a
sense of confidence it was necessary to have a
women's organization, quite independent of the
men's. And there have developed then the three
relationships between men and women: (1) the
Women's Department as one of the divisions of
work in the Alliance; (2) the Women's Auxiliary
to the men's society, and (3) the National Women's
Organization, in which men are not members.


LITHUANIAN WOMAN'S ALLIANCE

The idea of the separate woman's organization
finds an interesting illustration in the Lithuanian
Woman's Alliance. This national society, independent
of any other organization, was organized
in 1915 in Chicago. Only Lithuanian Catholic
women who are in good standing in the Church[210]
are admitted. The society has now grown, until
there are over five thousand members in different
Lithuanian communities throughout the United
States.

The society was organized for the education
of Lithuanian women in America. Those interested
in the organization recognized that it would
be very difficult to obtain support for such a
movement among women of the type they most
wished to interest unless it had the indorsement
of the Catholic Church.

There are two departments, an educational
(Absvieta) and a benefit (Pasalpa). It was recognized
by the leaders that little appeal could
be made to women for an educational enterprise,
for the majority of women are too ignorant and
indifferent; but like the Polish women they knew
that "benefit" would appeal to every immigrant
woman, for all belong to at least one friendly
insurance society. The poorer women and the
more recent immigrants are associated in the
little parish self-assessment societies, in which
each pays a small monthly fee, usually twenty-five
cents. Membership in a substantial fraternal
insurance society costs more than they can
afford to pay.

The Lithuanian Woman's Alliance provides
insurance for 35 cents a month. The benefit
department provides for the payment of a death
benefit of $150, and $5 per week will be paid[211]
upon request to any member who is sick more
than two weeks. In each case in which benefit
is granted, two visitors are appointed to make
arrangements for hospital care if necessary, and
to render any other needed assistance.

The idea back of this organization has been
to help immigrant women to adjust themselves to
the new circumstances of life in America; the
method chosen has been through education along
general and very practical lines, beginning at the
point where the women themselves have come
to recognize their needs. The fact that few of
these women can read even in their own language
makes it very difficult to reach them. At present,
however, the task seems less difficult than
ever before. The fact that fewer lodgers are
taken, that in some cases the higher wages have
lessened the pecuniary problems&mdash;even the fact
that women have been drawn outside the home
to work&mdash;these facts, together with the activities
of women in war work, have served to give them
a sense of identity with the American community;
so that there is now a greater demand for
English lessons than ever before. Many women
now realize the necessity of speaking the English
language, and women who read in Lithuanian are
eager to learn to read English so that they "may
know what is in the attractive-looking magazines
they see on the news stands."

The educational department is open to all[212]
women, whether they wish to avail themselves of
the benefit or not, but the benefit department is
open only upon condition that members also
take part in the educational movement. Dues in
the educational department alone are ten cents
a month. The educational program is to be carried
on through the local lodge and the official
organ, Woman's Field, issued monthly by the
central committee.

The magazine, aside from such space as is
needed for official notices, is devoted to educational
material. A typical number includes articles
on questions of general interest to women
everywhere. Emphasis is laid on the necessity
for women's learning English and assuming the
duties of citizenship. One page each month devoted
to questions of general hygiene and the
care of children is edited by a Lithuanian woman
physician. A page or section is given to instruction
in the preparation of food, as the Lithuanians
realize that one of the gravest problems for their
people here has been that of diet. Space is given
to articles about Lithuania, "so that the young
people may know that they need not be ashamed
of their country."

The educational work planned for the local
lodge includes instruction along many lines.
Classes are held two evenings a week in the
parish halls. The work of one of the more active
lodges gives an idea of the scope of the undertaking.[213]
This chapter numbers over fifty members.
Regular monthly meetings for the payment
of dues and transaction of business are
held on Sunday afternoon in the parish hall.
After the business is finished there is a social
hour.

Weekday classes have been held on two evenings
each week; on one, English and sewing
classes are held; on the other, cooking and housekeeping
classes. Women who have had greater
advantages in Europe as well as in the United
States give their services as teachers. All courses
are planned for women who have had very little
opportunity in either country; the president of
one of the lodges said, in explaining their program,
"You know Lithuanian women are not
high up like American women&mdash;they do not know
how to keep house or cook or take care of
babies."

On one evening in the week the whole time is
devoted to housekeeping. The church hall has
been equipped with a gas stove, a set of cooking
utensils, dining-room table, linen, dishes, and silver.
Lessons are given in the preparation and
serving of a meal. Some attention is given to
food values, but the object is mainly to show
women how to prepare wholesome food as economically
as possible. Processes of canning, preserving,
and drying fruits and vegetables are
demonstrated, as they are wholly new to most of[214]
the women. The women are also shown how to
scrub, wash dishes, and care for clothing.

Reference might also be made to a local society
organized by Lithuanian women about twelve
years ago on a mutual-benefit basis, for educational
purposes, which were stated in the constitution
to be:

... to provide sick and death benefit; to organize Lithuanian
women for a better and larger education; to provide
evening and day classes in reading, writing, sewing, sanitary
housekeeping, and the care of children; to provide
lectures, books, and programs to interest women in health
and education; to encourage friendship among Lithuanian
women, and provide social life; to provide scholarships for
students seeking higher education; to encourage writers;
to encourage women to read the newspapers in Lithuanian
and English.

These women, who have all been in the United
States for a considerable period, and know the
needs of the newcomers, have fitted up a housekeeping
center in the public park center in their
neighborhood. They have a kitchen and dining-room
equipment consisting of a stove, a set of
cooking utensils, and a dining table with service.
Here cooking classes are held once a week, the
lessons given by the women who are skilled in
cookery.

The attempt is made to create an interest in
food values, in proper cooking, and in wise spending.
In housekeeping lessons, washing, scrubbing,
washing windows, and even dishwashing[215]
and the setting of the table are taught. Classes
in English have been organized, but these women
have suffered as others have suffered from a lack
of teachers skilled in teaching this kind of a
group, and from a lack of classroom material
suited to their needs.

The Polish and the Lithuanian societies illustrate
the organized effort of women in those
groups in which the group life is highly developed,
in which a number of women have
become conscious of separate needs and undertake
to assist in the development of others
of their sex.


UKRAINIAN BEGINNINGS

Among the Ukrainian women the beginnings of
this process can be observed, but in this case
there is common effort on the part of the most
progressive men and women in behalf of the more
backward women. We are told that the Ukrainian
women have much greater authority and responsibility
in the United States than in the
Ukraine, so that some men say that here "the laws
are made for women." They spend the money,
discipline the children, and direct the household
life. Many of the women have been poorly fitted,
by their inferior status at home, for their new
duties, and the Ukrainian Women's Alliance was
organized in 1917 by both men and women in an
attempt to meet this situation.[216]

This organization, too, is based on the benefit
idea, which all the women can understand, but
plans are already laid for a comprehensive educational
program to be carried out not only
through educational centers in the local lodges,
but through a magazine of national circulation.
This is a complete innovation, as there has never
before existed among the Ukrainians a woman's
association, nor has any attention been paid to
their interests in Ukrainian publications. The
organ of the Alliance had in October, 1919, put
out four issues, and met with so cordial a
response that its next number was double the
size of the first numbers and the sales at news
stands were sufficient to cover the cost of these
first numbers.

The contents of one number indicate the purposes
sought by its publication. Of the articles,
one describes the organization of the Alliance, one
discusses the relation of the institution of the
home to the community, with special stress laid
on the responsibilities of the mother in the home,
one explains the woman-suffrage movement and
urges the importance of woman's place in government.
There is a department devoted to diet,
food values, and recipes, and one devoted to hygiene,
with special emphasis on child care.

In some of the other national groups the
number of men is still so far in excess of the
number of women that the energies of the group[217]
seem to have been absorbed in dealing with the
problems of the men or of getting a foothold as
a group.


ITALIAN WOMEN UNORGANIZED

This does not apply to the Italian community.
While benefit societies among the Italians are
very numerous, there has until recently been
little movement toward a national organization
similar to those among the Poles and Lithuanians.
The deep division in dialect, custom, and
feeling between people from different sections of
Italy accounts for the number of societies as
well as for the lack of affiliation among them.
Three of the largest societies in Chicago, in which
membership is largely Sicilian, are now affiliated,
but no effort has been discovered to make use
of the organization as a basis for domestic educational
enterprise.

Women are admitted to many of the societies
on the same terms as men, but rarely attend
meetings. There are many small self-assessment
societies for women alone, but they have no social
or educational feature; members seldom meet,
and dues are often sent in by children.

The idea of using their own organizations as a
means of carrying on educational work among
women is a novel one in the Italian community,
but it is being recognized as a possible method of
attacking the great need for education in maternal[218]
and infant welfare, in the care of small children,
and in sanitary housekeeping.

The Italian physicians, for example, realize
that the women need instruction, and the Italian
Medical Association, in May, 1919, planned a
series of lectures for mothers, in Italian, on these
subjects, but found that there were great difficulties
in reaching the mothers with such material.
It is therefore very important that every
device be tried for reaching the more intelligent
women, who with the helpful neighborliness that
exists in all the neighborhoods would share with
their less-informed sisters the benefits of their
aroused interests.


GROWTH OF NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

It is clear, then, that highly organized societies
established primarily for mutual insurance often
undertake educational and social projects which
tend to overshadow their original purpose as the
economic position of the members of the national
group becomes more stable. Leaders who are inaugurating
national educational movements in
the less well-established groups are consciously
using the benefit feature because of its universal
appeal, and employing the general methods and
machinery of the fraternal insurance organization.

Modification of the official machinery is the
inevitable result of the change in purpose. We
find, for instance, that the local lodge, originally[219]
only a meeting for the payment of dues, becomes
a center for discussion of problems of concern to
the local community or to the national group,
and often the field in which the educational program
planned by the national society is carried
out.

The official organ, designed to carry official
communication and news, tends to subordinate
this function to the educational and cultural
features. To a certain extent it becomes a
national educational journal. It is to be noted
that with the separation of men's and women's
lodges and the growth of the influence of women
in the national policy of the society, the section
of the official organ devoted to the interests of
women is extended. The very real problem of
the immigrant woman in adjusting herself and
the family life to the new conditions here, is
given greater consideration.

As these organizations have been so efficiently
developed, and as the leaders in the different
groups hope for a united group where before
there has been a separate and segregated one, it
seemed worth while to consult the representatives
of the different groups in some detail with reference
to the method of using educational material
dealing with family adjustment. The subject
of child care seemed the most obviously pertinent
and interesting, and a section of the
United States Children's Bureau Study on the[220]
Pre-School Child was submitted for their consideration
with the question as to its adaptation
to the needs of the various groups.

All to whose attention it was called agreed
that it was material of the highest importance,
and that if translated it would prove of greatest
interest. A translation was therefore presented
to these representatives for their consideration.
Again, all agreed that the only questions were
the extent to which the material would have to
be explained in terms of foodstuffs and methods
of care familiar to the women in the different
groups.

All agreed that the material should be given
to the women in small doses graphically presented.
The installment plan should be the rule. All
agreed that illustrations would greatly add to
the interest and the ease with which the lesson
would be understood. And all agreed that a
very effective way of arousing and maintaining
interest would be to call in to conference representatives
of the different important agencies,
the Church, the school, the midwife, the doctor,
to obtain common consideration of the material
with reference to its more exact adaptation to
the needs of the particular group.

Several editors agreed that much of the material
could be used without such conference if it
were only skillfully translated&mdash;which is a difficult
and costly process. The Foreign Language[221]
Information Service of the National Red Cross
has begun this work, and finds a hearty reception
for its translations of such material. But the
editors likewise thought that such conferences as
have been described would have very great effect
in securing co-operation in the use of the material.

It is clear that the same general method could
be applied to the use of other similar material
bearing on problems of family adjustment, or on
the other aspects of adjustment; but in the field
of family adjustment there is available a great
body of information and suggestion organized by
the expert members of the various Federal bureau
staffs for the purpose of accomplishing just
the end we have under consideration. This is
true not only of the work done by the United
States government, but by the state and city
governments as well.

The development and maintenance of an
agency which could make available to foreign-speaking
groups through their own organizations
the material already awaiting use, would correspond
with the hopes and the intentions of
leaders among the various groups, facilitate their
work, and make possible a fine and a fruitful co-operation
among elements that have in the past
been separate, if not hostile.




[222]
VIII

AGENCIES OF ADJUSTMENT


In the first six chapters an attempt has been made
to set out certain difficulties with which foreign-born
family groups are confronted on arrival. It
has become clear that certain services skillfully
rendered might prevent a great deal of needless
suffering, discomfort, and waste, and also greatly
facilitate the adjustment of the family to the new
surroundings. The services that would be appropriate
to the needs of all housewives might
be classed under (1) the exercise of hospitality;
(2) supplying information and opportunities
for instruction; (3) assistance in the performance
of household tasks. Suggestions that
these services might prove useful are not
based wholly on theory, and attention may
at this point be directed to the work of certain
agencies which have attempted to do these
various things.

The suggestion has been frequently made that
the immigrant should be the object of certain
protective care during the journey across the[223]
ocean and on arrival.[53] The proposal here is that
the community would gain enormously through
the creation of devices for the exercise of a community
hospitality. This should include the receiving
and distributing of new arrivals in such
a way as to assure their being put into touch, not
only with their relatives and friends, but with
the community resources which could be of special
service as well.

Attention has been called to the efforts put
forth by organizations among the foreign-speaking
groups. The possibility of their more efficient
and wider activity should be always kept in mind.
But the work of the Immigrants' Protective
League of Chicago, in behalf of unaccompanied
women and girls, illustrates both the nature of
the task and the way in which the development
of such services requires a familiarity with the
governmental organizations and a capacity for
utilizing official agencies not to be found among
the groups most needing help.


IMMIGRANTS' PROTECTIVE LEAGUE

The work of this society has been referred to a
number of times, and its methods and special
objects should perhaps be briefly summarized.
Its organization in 1907 grew out of a desire to
[224]assist the immigrant girls coming into Chicago,
with special reference to their industrial relations.
The objects described in the charter of incorporation
are, however, much wider than this. They
were:

... to apply the civic, social, and philanthropic resources of
the city to the needs of foreigners in Chicago, to protect them
from exploitation, to co-operate with the Federal, state, and
local authorities, and with similar organizations in other
localities, and to protect the right of asylum in all proper
cases. (By-Laws, Art. II.)

The services of the organization have been taken
advantage of by members of all the national
groups in Chicago, and these services have included
meeting immigrant trains and distributing
arriving immigrants to their destination in
the city, prosecuting the agencies from which
the immigrant suffered especial exploitation, visiting
immigrant girls, securing appropriate legislation,
and in general making known to the community
the special needs of the newly arrived
immigrants.

The League has from the beginning made use
of the services of foreign-speaking visitors, and
the volume and success of its work has varied
with the number of these visitors, the extent to
which they represented groups in need of special
aid, and their skill as social workers. At the time
of the publication of the last report, the following
languages besides English were spoken by[225]
these visitors: German, Bohemian, Italian, Lettish,
Lithuanian, Magyar, Polish, Russian, Slovak,
and Yiddish. Many aspects of its work do
not bear on this discussion, but the following
brief passages from the annual reports indicate
the way in which the work in behalf of unaccompanied
girls developed.

During the past year and a half the League has received
from the various ports of arrival the names and addresses
of the girls and women destined for Chicago. All of these
newly arrived girls and women have been visited by representatives
of the League able to speak the language of the
immigrant. Four, and part of the time five, women speaking
the Slavic languages&mdash;German, French, Italian, and
Greek&mdash;have been employed for this work. In these visits
information has been accumulated in regard to the journey
to Chicago, the depot situation, the past industrial experience
of the girls, their occupation in Chicago, wages, hours
of work, their living conditions, the price they pay for
board, and whether they are contributing to the support of
some one at home. On this basis the League's work for girls
has been planned. (Annual Report, 1909-10, p. 13.)

In these visits many girls needing assistance are found.
The most difficult ones to help are those for whom the visitor
sees a danger which the girl is unable to anticipate.
Often a girl is a pioneer, who comes in advance of her family,
and the friend or acquaintance whom she knows in Chicago
undertakes to help her in finding her first job and a place
to live, and then leaves her to solve the future for herself.
If she should be out of work or in trouble she has no one
whom she can ask for advice or help. In cases of this sort
all that the visitor can do is to establish a connection which
will make the girl feel that she has some one she can turn
to in case of trouble or unemployment. (Annual Report,
1909-10, p. 15.)

Sometimes the League's visitor can do little more than[226]
offer the encouragement which the girl so much needs during
the first few years in America. Usually she tries to
persuade the girl to attend the nearest night school; sometimes
she helps her in finding work, or a proper boarding
place; sometimes, when the immigrant is educated, she has
to quite sternly insist that any kind of work must be accepted
until English has been learned. Some girls are discovered
only after it is too late to prevent a tragedy. In
the cases of two girls, one Polish and the other Bohemian,
who had been betrayed by the uncles who had brought
them to this country, the results were especially discouraging
because the efforts to punish the men failed and one of
the girls who had suffered so much from the uncle whom
she thought she could trust was deported. (Annual Report
for the Year Ending January 1, 1914, p. 11.)

It is clear that such a plan involved the distribution
of information from the ports of entry
to the places of destination,[54] and the development
of instrumentalities through which the immigrant
on arrival at his destination can be
placed in contact with those from whom help of
the kind needed could be expected. A nation-wide
network of agencies for such hospitality,
with headquarters at the ports of entry, is seen
to be necessary from the descriptions of the services
to be rendered. The development of such
machinery by the Federal Immigration Service,
as at present organized, may be unthinkable;
but with a change in personnel and with a wider
[227]understanding of the nature of the problem, the
apparently impossible might be realized.

In the meantime, the service need not wholly
wait on this remote possibility. There are agencies,
both public and private, which with enlarged
resources might undertake a considerable portion
of this task and develop more completely
both the methods of approach and a body of persons
skilled in this particular kind of service.
Such work as that done on a small scale by the
Immigrants' Protective League is especially instructive.
The resources of that organization for
all its tasks have been limited, so that visitors
have been only to a slight extent specialized,
except in the matter of language. But with enlarged
resources, so that a larger number and
better trained visitors might be employed, this
gracious and important hospitality might be
widely exercised.


A NATIONAL RECEPTION COMMITTEE

As this visiting developed among the different
groups, several results could be anticipated. Just
as the needs of the unaccompanied girls have
been learned in this way, the needs of the families
in the different groups could become more
exactly understood, and devices for meeting
those needs more efficiently worked out. It
would perhaps be possible to urge the woman
to learn English when she is first confronted[228]
with the strangeness of her situation, and before
she slips into the makeshifts by which she later
is apparently able to get on without learning
English. Instruction in English might be made
to appear the path of least resistance, if it were
made attractive and available to the immigrant
housewife at a sufficiently early moment.

These visitors might preferably be English-speaking
members of the foreign-speaking groups.
If there were a sufficient staff, they might also
render many similar services to other women in
the foreign-born groups. They could persuade
those who have not yet learned English to come
into English classes; they could organize groups
for instruction in cooking, child care, house and
neighborhood sanitation; and gradually accumulate
both additional knowledge as to the need
and experience in meeting it.

A point to be emphasized in connection with
this service is that it is not related in any way to
the problem of dependency, but is directed
wholly toward meeting the difficulties growing
out of the strangeness of the newcomer to the
immediate situation. By developing a method
for lessening the difficulties connected with the
migration of any group from one section to another
differing in industrial or social organization,
light would be thrown on analogous problems
such as the movements among the negroes
from the South to the North during the war, or[229]
of the mountain people to the cotton-mill villages
at an earlier date.

Another point to be emphasized is that while
the method of approach and of immediate service
can be developed independently, and while
the amount of discomfort and genuine distress
that can be prevented is very great&mdash;as is shown
in the experience of families whom such organizations
as now attempt work along this line have
aided&mdash;the opportunity for swift and efficient
adjustment will be dependent on the development
of a body of educational technique.

It has been made clear that there are certain
kinds of information that should be given to the
newcomers, with reference, for example, to the
change in the legal relationships within the family
group, the new responsibilities of the husband
and father, and the rights of wife and children to
support. Attention has been called to the need
of giving instruction regarding sanitary and hygienic
practices, with reference to the new money
values, and to the new conditions under which
articles of household use are to be obtained, to
the requirements in food and clothing, particularly
for the children, in the new locality as
compared with that from which the family comes.
And, as has been suggested, above all there is
always the question of teaching English.

Sometimes the necessary facts can be conveyed
briefly and immediately. Sometimes patient[230]
individual instruction will be necessary.
Sometimes group or class instruction will be the
proper device. It is highly important, then, that
these various forms of instruction be developed
into a technique. Courses of instruction to be
given according to these different methods to
those for whom a particular method is appropriate
must be organized, and a body of teachers
developed.

The question then arises as to the extent to
which this task has been undertaken and the
agencies that have undertaken it. As to the
first great body of material, it may be said to
have been ignored. Only when one is summoned
to the Juvenile Court of Domestic Relations, or
when one learns of another's being summoned,
is the body of family law called to the attention
of the group. In English, in cooking, and child
care, some agencies have attempted instruction.
They are the public school, organizations like the
Immigrants' Protective League, the State Immigration
Commission, the social settlement,
recreation centers of various kinds, the Young
Women's Christian Association in its International
Institutes. The possibilities in the work
of these agencies are numerous.


THE PUBLIC SCHOOL

The public school touches the foreign-born family
at two points: First, in the compulsory education[231]
of the children, and second, in the opportunities
that it offers to the adult members of
the family to learn English, to fit themselves for
citizenship, and to adjust their lives to the new
community.

The adaptation of the public schools to these
tasks belongs properly to another section of this
study.[55] In so far, however, as the school contributes
through its attitude toward the parent
to a breakdown in family discipline, and in so far
as it tries or does not try to instruct the foreign-born
housewife in the art of housekeeping, it
is concerned with problems that are primarily
family problems. It may be of interest, then, to
cite certain evidence obtained from foreign-born
leaders and typical foreign-born families as to
the relationship existing between the schools and
foreign-born parents, the methods used by the
schools in the education of foreign-born women,
and their apparent success or failure.

Reference has already been made to the place
that the school sometimes plays in the breakdown
of family discipline, because of ignorance
on the part of the teachers concerning the social
and domestic attitudes prevailing among the
foreign-born groups.

The school has, in fact, been able to take so
little account of the mother that so long as things
run fairly smoothly she is usually unable to realize
[232]that she has any place at all in the scheme. Again
and again, to the question as to whether she
visits the school where her children go, comes
the answer, "Oh no, my children never have any
trouble in school." As long as they are not in
trouble she is not called into consultation. She
may even be made to feel quite unwelcome if
she is bold enough to visit the schoolroom, so
she very soon comes to the conclusion that the
education of her children is really none of her
business.

Sometimes the teacher thoughtlessly contributes
to the belittling of the parent in the eyes of
the child. An Italian man tells the story of a
woman he knew who whipped her boy for truancy
and then went to consult the teacher. But instead
of a serious and sympathetic talk, the
teacher in the child's presence upbraided the
mother for punishing the child. The child of
foreign-born parents, as well as the native-born
child, often learns in the public school to despise
what is other than American in dress, customs,
language, and political institutions, and both are
thus influenced to despise the foreign-born parent
who continues in the old way.

There is, of course, often a failure on the part
of the teacher to uphold the dignity and authority
of the parents in the native-born group,
and the need of bridging the gap between school
authorities and parents has been recognized by[233]
the organization of the Parent-Teachers' organization
as well as of the Patrons' Department of
the National Education Association. It may be
that at a later date, when certain general fundamental
questions of co-operation have been
dealt with, devices for meeting the difficulties
of special groups of parents will be developed.

On the subject of courses of instruction attention
has been called to the many points at which
the foreign-born housewife needs instruction and
assistance in familiarizing herself with the new
conditions under which she lives. When there
exists such a universal and widely felt need which
could be filled by giving instruction in a field in
which the material is organized and available,
the opportunity of the school is apparent. Not
only courses in English, in the art of cooking, in
the principles of selection and preservation of
food, but those describing the peculiarities of the
modern industrial urban community as contrasted
with the simple rural community, could
be planned, methods of instruction could be developed,
and regular curricula could be organized.

There are, to be sure, certain inherent difficulties
to be met in the instruction of housewives.
The old saying, "Man's work is from sun to sun,
but woman's work is never done," has been so
long accepted as the expression of the inevitable
that it is difficult to persuade anyone, most of
all the housewife herself, that she can manage to[234]
give an hour or two a day to learning something
new. Her time seems never her own, with tasks
morning, afternoon, and night.

Nor is it only a question of overwork. Undoubtedly
careful planning is uncommon, and
the tradition that woman's place is in the home
has its effect. In fact, there is a vicious circle;
she cannot study because her housekeeping is
too arduous, but it is so partly because she does
not take time to learn better ways of doing her
work.

There is, moreover, among most housewives,
whether native or foreign born, a certain complacency
about housekeeping and bringing up
children. Housekeeping is supposed to come by
nature, and few women of any station in life
are trained to be homemakers and mothers. If
they take any training it is generally designed to
fit them to earn a living only until they are married.
They do not realize how useful certain
orderly instruction might be.

Moreover, instruction for foreign-born housewives
must include the subjects needed for homemaking
as well as English. Having survived the
first hard adjustments it is difficult to persuade
the foreign-born mother that she has any need
for speaking English when housekeeping is all that
is expected of her. The situation is often complicated,
too, by her age at immigration and her
lack of education in the old country, which make[235]
her particularly ill-fitted for ordinary classroom
instruction.

Besides these difficulties there are certain
prejudices to be met. The middle-aged woman
does not wish to study English in classes with
her children of working age or others of their
age. She dreads the implication of this association.
Many of the foreign-born mothers also
have a hesitancy about going into classes with
men, as they feel a mental inferiority, and many
prefer not to be in classes with students from
other national groups.

The most frequent criticism by immigrant leaders
interviewed is the inelasticity of the public-school
methods. The classes are usually held three
or four nights a week, and no housewife should
be expected to leave home as often as that. The
groups are composed of both men and women
and of all nationalities, disregarding well-known
prejudices that have already been mentioned.

A more fundamental criticism than these has
reference to the failure to adopt or devise new
methods of instruction for persons who cannot
read or write in their own language, and who
have arrived at a period in their lives when
learning is extremely difficult. The classes are
often conducted in English by day-school teachers,
who are accustomed to teaching children and who
are entirely unfamiliar with the background of
the immigrant woman and her special problems.[236]

There are reports also of the unwillingness of
the school authorities to relax formal requirements,
with reference to the minimum number
for whom a class will be organized. Often it is
necessary to "nurse the class." In Chicago sixteen
women have in the past been deprived of a
class because the Board of Education refused at
the time to open the schools to groups of less
than twenty.


THE HOME TEACHER

The home teacher in California is an interesting
educational device, of which much is to be expected.
The Home Teacher Act, passed by the
state legislature April 10, 1915,[56] permits boards
of school trustees or city boards of education to
employ one "home teacher" for every five hundred
or more units of average daily attendance.
The home teacher is

to work in the homes of the pupils, instructing children and
adults in matters relating to school attendance and preparation
therefor, also in sanitation, in the English language,
in household duties, such as purchase, preparation, and use
of food and clothing, and in the fundamental principles of
the American system of government and the rights and
duties of citizenship. She is required to possess the following
qualifications:

1. A regular teacher's certificate under the State Education
Law.[237]

2. Experience in teaching and in social work.

3. Good health.

4. Ability to speak the language of the largest group in the district.

5. Complete loyalty to the principal of the school.

6. Tact and patience for a delicate task.

7. Ingenuity in adapting all circumstances to the main purpose.

8. An incapacity for discouragement.

9. Comprehension of the reasons and objects of the work.

10. Finally, above all and through all, a sympathetic attitude
toward the people, which involves some knowledge
of the countries and conditions from which they came,
and what "America" has meant to them.[57]

Her salary is paid from the city or from district
special school funds.

The law authorizing the use of home teachers
was enacted largely through the efforts of the
State Commission of Immigration and Housing,
and was from the first intended to be used for
the benefit of foreign-born families. The first
experiments were financed by the Commission
of Immigration and Housing and by private organizations,
such as the Daughters of the American
Revolution, the Council of Jewish Women,
and the Young Women's Christian Association.
According to the latest report[58] there are twenty
official home teachers at work in eight cities of
the state. The Commission says of the purpose
of this plan:
[238]
The interpretation of the need in California departs from
that conceived elsewhere. There have been so-called home
teachers in a dozen cities, of several Eastern states, for a
number of years, but their purpose is to do follow-up work
for absent, irregular, subnormal, or incorrigible children,
and they are more properly visiting teachers. The home
teacher, as we conceive her purpose, seeks not primarily
the special child&mdash;though that will often open the door to
her and afford her a quick opportunity for friendly help&mdash;but
the home as such, and especially the mother who makes
it. This discrimination as to aim and purpose cannot be
too much emphasized, or too consistently maintained, for
the care of abnormal children, important as it is, can by no
means take the place of the endeavor to Americanize the
families of the community.[59]


SETTLEMENT CLASSES

The social settlements are in many cases situated
in congested city districts, and they have always
dealt very directly with the family groups in
their neighborhood. Settlements have, in fact,
probably more than any other social agency,
tried to become acquainted with the Old-World
background of their neighbors in order to establish
friendly relationships. The settlement ideal
has included the preservation of the dignity and
self-esteem of the immigrant, while attempting
to modify his habits when necessary and giving
him some preparation for citizenship.



LITHUANIAN MOTHERS HAVE COME TO A SETTLEMENT CLASS


Classes in English and Civics, mothers' clubs,
and housekeeping classes have been part of the
contribution of the settlement to the adjustment
[239]of family life. Seventeen settlements in Chicago,
for example, have conducted during the last year
36 clubs and classes of this kind for non-English-speaking
women. Among these there are 9 English
classes, 8 sewing classes, 10 cooking classes,
and 9 mothers' clubs, with varied programs.

These classes have been conducted with a
flexibility that is often lacking in the public-school
classes. They are usually held in the daytime
at the hour most convenient for the group
concerned, and by combining social features with
instruction the interest of the women is maintained
longer than would otherwise be possible.

Sometimes the classes are conducted in a foreign
language, but they are generally taught in
English, occasionally with the assistance of an
interpreter. The classes are usually small, so
that considerable personal attention is possible.
The season during which it seems possible to
hold such classes lasts from September or October
until June, and it seems necessary to expend
considerable effort each year in order to reorganize
them.

Trained domestic-science teachers are used for
most of the cooking and sewing classes. The
English teachers and mothers' club leaders are,
however, usually residents in the settlement or
other volunteers with little training or experience
in teaching adults. They often find it quite
difficult to hold the group together. Very valuable[240]
work is done, however, especially in the
cooking classes. Many such classes were organized
to teach conservation cooking; for instance,
in an Italian class, the women were taught the
use of substitutes for wheat that could be used
in macaroni; in another the cooking teacher took
Italian recipes and tried to reproduce their flavors
with American products which are cheaper and
more available than the Italian articles.

What is gained in flexibility may, of course, be
counterbalanced by a loss of unity. The settlement
teaching lacks, on the whole, a unity and
organization that the public school should be
better able to provide.


CO-OPERATION OF AGENCIES

Sometimes co-operation among several agencies
may be advantageous in meeting the various
difficulties presented by the task of teaching
adult foreign-born women. Such co-operation
was developed between the Immigrants' Protective
League of Chicago, the public schools, the
Chicago Woman's Club and the Women's Division
of the Illinois Council of Defense.

The Board of Education of Chicago, in 1917,
passed a resolution to the effect that whenever
twenty or more adults desired instruction in any
subject which would increase their value in citizenship,
the school would be opened and a
trained teacher provided. The Immigrants' Protective[241]
League then undertook to organize groups
who would take advantage of this opportunity
and to keep the groups interested after they had
been organized.

The Chicago Woman's Club and the Council
of National Defense undertook to supply kindergarten
teachers to care for the children whose
mothers were in the class, and the Visiting Nurse
Association supplied nurses to examine the children,
to advise mothers with reference to their
care, and to make home visits when the condition
of the children rendered this necessary.

The League visitors made very definite efforts
to organize campaigns for acquainting the housewives
of various neighborhoods with the opportunity
thus provided, and for persuading the
women to "come out." The services of the
foreign-born visitors have been particularly valuable
in the work of organization. These visitors
certainly put forth valiant efforts in behalf of
the plan. The Lithuanian and Italian visitors,
for example, made in three instances 40, 96, and
125 calls before a class was organized, and even
then less than twenty enrolled for each class.
They have found it necessary to make visits in
the homes of women whom they hoped to draw
out, and have also used posters, printed invitations,
and advertisements in foreign-language
newspapers. Nor have their efforts ceased when
the class was organized. Often misunderstandings[242]
occur, the attendance begins to dwindle, and
great efforts must be made to discover the cause
and to bring back the members.

The classes organized in this way have usually
been small, composed of housewives of a single
national group. Considerable individual attention
is given the members of the class, and the
foreign-speaking visitors attend the classes so
that they may interpret when necessary.

The plan has been carried out, of course, on
an extremely restricted stage. The efforts have
been limited almost entirely to English and cooking
classes, and instruction in other phases of
household management has been quite incidental.

The teachers supplied by the Board of Education
have not, of course, always possessed social
experience and training. The classes are sometimes
short lived. In the case of a Lithuanian
cooking class, to which the teacher came too
late to give the lesson, or too weary to give the
lesson, it was necessary to reorganize the group.
Where the teachers change, the group will dwindle,
and the efforts of the visitor will have been
substantially wasted.

The subject matter is often poorly adapted to
the needs and desires of the foreign housewife.
A new domestic-science teacher, for instance,
gave to a group of Lithuanian women seven
consecutive lessons on pies, cakes, and cookies,
in spite of the organizer's request for lessons on[243]
"plain cooking." At times, as has been pointed
out, the teacher is wholly ignorant as to the habits
and tastes of the immigrant. There is, sometimes,
an ill-advised attempt to substitute American
dishes for foreign dishes instead of modifying
or supplementing the well-established and
perfectly sound dietetic practices of the foreign-born
group.

The Lithuanian visitor of the Immigrants'
Protective League, in speaking of the difficulties
she had encountered in keeping together the
classes she organized for the public school, says
she has often been able to get together a group
of women who want lessons in English and in
cooking. The plan has been to give cooking
lessons in English. The women have come, perhaps,
three or four times. The first lesson would
teach the making of biscuits; perhaps the second
dumplings; the third sweet rolls. The
teacher would be very busy with her cooking
and talk very little. Then the women would
not come back. They did not want to learn to
make biscuits, about which they cared nothing;
they were busy women and were aware that they
were not getting what they wanted or needed.


INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTES

Another specialized agency for work with the
foreign-born groups is the International Institute
of the Young Women's Christian Association.[244]
This association has attempted in a short period
of time to develop over a wide area this form of
service, so that between the spring of 1913 and
March, 1919, there had been established 31 of
these organizations, most of them in industrial
centers in different parts of the United States.
In general, their work, as outlined in the After-War
Program of the association, includes (1) a
foreign-language information office, (2) home
visiting for newly arrived women and girls, (3)
case work in connection with legal difficulties,
sickness, and emergencies, and (4) work with
groups, including organized classes and informal
gatherings. The last are to be especially designed
for women and girls unable or unwilling
to attend night schools, and there is to be a
persistent urging upon the public school of
the importance of socialized methods in work
for women.

The use of foreign-language visitors is considered
to be one of the most important features of
these undertakings. Although few of the institutes
have been able to secure enough workers
to reach all the language groups in the community,
provision can usually be made for the
most numerous groups. Among the 18 replies
to questionnaires sent to these institutes only 4
show less than 3 languages spoken by visitors,
10 have as many as 4 or more, and 4 have 8 or
9 languages.[245]

These 18 institutes employ 76 foreign-language
visitors. Forty-six of these are themselves foreign
born. These visitors represent a great variety in
training and experience, but the institute secretaries
think that on the whole they are more
valuable than native-born visitors would be even
if these native-born visitors were more highly
trained. The training of these particular visitors,
while varied and often apparently inadequate, is
on the whole surprisingly good. Fifteen of the 46
have had some college training; 3 have had kindergarten
training, and 4 nurses' training. Eight
have had previous case-work experience; 4 have
lived in settlements. Eight have taken training
courses given by the association, varying from
a few weeks to several months at the national
headquarters. A number have had religious
training of one kind or another, 2 in a school for
deaconesses, 12 as prospective missionaries, and
1 in a theological seminary.

The 18 International Institutes report the establishment
of 134 clubs or classes in which married
women are members, having an enrollment
of 894 foreign-born married women. The subject
most generally taught is English. Among
134 clubs and classes, 101 are organized exclusively
for the teaching of English, and 7 others
combine English with cooking or sewing.

Some attempt is made to teach housekeeping
in classes. Ten of these are organized for cooking[246]
or sewing, 7 for English and cooking or sewing,
and there are 13 mothers' clubs with subjects
of such general interest as health, the care
of children, and home nursing. In addition to
the organized clubs and classes, most of the
institutes have given lectures in foreign languages
to larger groups of women subjects such as
"Women and the War," "Liberty Bonds,"
"Thrift," "Food Conservation," "Personal and
Social Hygiene," "The Buying of Materials,"
and "What the English Language Can Do for
You."

Most classes are composed of a single national
group, but classes are reported in which there
are Polish and Ruthenian, Slovak and Polish,
Greek and Lithuanian, Armenian and French,
and Portuguese, Magyar and Slovak, and
"mixed" nationalities. English is used in practically
all classes which are primarily for the
teaching of English. Fourteen of the institutes,
however, have foreign-speaking workers to interpret
whenever the women do not understand
the teacher. In answer to the question
as to the success of the institute in connecting
married women with classes in public evening
schools, three reply that they have had
no success because the public schools do not
use foreign-speaking workers and the women
cannot understand the teachers who speak only
English.[247]

The institutes conduct vigorous campaigns
to acquaint the mothers with their work,
using posters, printed invitations, announcements
at schools, notices in foreign papers,
and particularly home visits by foreign-speaking
workers.

With regard to home visiting it appears that
there has not yet been time to work out a program
for the teaching of improved standards of
housekeeping, personal hygiene, and proper diet.
The institutes, however, lend their foreign-speaking
visitors as interpreters to other agencies
organized for particular phases of work in
the home, such as Visiting Nurse associations,
Infant Welfare societies, Anti-Tuberculosis societies,
and Charity Organization societies.

A very real effort is often made to reconcile
foreign-born mothers and Americanized daughters.
Those responsible for some of the institutes
realize very keenly the significance of the problem,
and impress upon the children they meet
their great interest in the Old-World background
of the parents, their appreciation of the mother's
being able to speak another language besides
English, their pleasure in old-country dances,
costumes, and songs. They try in every way
possible to maintain the respect of the daughter
for her foreign-born mother. In home visits they
try also to explain to the mother the freedom
granted to American girls, the purpose of the[248]
clubs for girls, and the need for learning English
themselves to lessen their dependence upon the
children.


TRAINING FOR SERVICE

It is obvious that the efficiency of the work of
these various organizations can rise no higher
than the level of efficiency and training of the
workers available for such service. It is, therefore,
most important that the materials necessary
for the rendering of these services be made
available at the earliest possible moment. Such
materials include compilations of data with reference
to the different groups, courses of study
developed so as to meet the needs and educational
possibilities of the women, devices such as
pictures, slides, charts, films, for getting and
holding attention of persons unused to study,
often weary and overstrained and lacking confidence
in their own power to learn.

It is also clear from the experiences of these
various agencies that, while giving this instruction
is essentially an educational problem, it is
for the time so intimately connected with the
whole question of understanding the needs of the
housewife in the different foreign-born groups,
of developing a method of approach and of organization,
and of trying out methods of instruction
as well as experimenting with different
bodies of material, that for some time to come[249]
experimentation and research should be fostered
at many points.

There should, for example, be accumulated a
much larger body of knowledge than is now available
with reference to the agencies existing among
the foreign-born groups in the various communities
from whom co-operation could be expected;
there should be a much more exact body of fact
as to the needs of the various groups of women;
at the earliest possible moment the material available
with reference to these household problems,
child care, hygiene and sanitation, distribution of
family income, should be put into form available
for use by the home teacher, the class teacher,
the extension workers, and the woman's club
organization. In the Appendix are some menus
of four immigrant groups, which illustrate the
kind of material which would be useful.

By stipends and scholarships promising younger
members from among the foreign-born groups
should be encouraged to qualify as home teachers
and as classroom and extension instructors
in these fields. This would often mean giving
opportunity for further general education as preliminary
to the professional training, for many
young persons admirably adapted to the work
come from families too poor to afford the necessary
time at school. Scholarships providing for
an adequate preparation available to members of
the larger groups in any community, would give[250]
a very great incentive to interest in the problem
and to further understanding of its importance
on the part of the whole group.

In addition to scholarships enabling young persons
to take courses of considerable length, there
might be stipends enabling older women of judgment
and experience to qualify for certain forms
of service by shorter courses. Those who can
speak enough English could take advantage of
certain short courses already offered by the
schools of social work. Others who do not speak
English could be enabled to learn enough English
and at the same time to learn to carry on
certain forms of service under direction.

As has been suggested, lack of resources in
face of an enormous volume of educational work
is one factor in this lack of teachers trained to
meet the needs of women in the foreign-born
groups and of material adapted to their class or
home instruction. The question, then, has been
raised as to whether the supply both of teachers
and of material could be increased and whether,
if these resources were available, they would be
utilized by the great national administrative
agencies to which reference has been made.

The following plan has been approved as thoroughly
practicable by leading officers and members
of the American Home Economics Association,
including several heads of departments of
home economics in the state colleges, by other[251]
educators interested in the field of home economics,
as well as by representatives of the
States Relations Service, the Bureau of Home
Economics Department in the United States
Department of Agriculture, the Federal Board of
Vocational Education, and the Home Economics
Division of the United States Bureau of
Education. The unanimous judgment of those
consulted is that if such a plan could be carried
out for the space of three years, the Federal service
would be vivified and enriched and the educational
institutions enabled to develop training
methods from which a continuous supply of
teachers and teaching material could be expected.


OUTLINE OF PLAN

I. Creation of committee composed of officers of American
Home Economics Association, representatives from the
United States Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Home
Economics, the States Relations Service, the Home Economics
Division of the United States Bureau of Education, the
heads of departments of home economics in the state colleges,
the technical schools and teacher-training schools, Federal
Board for Vocational Education.

II. Increasing supply of teachers and teaching material.


1. Provision for assembling material in food,
household management, including expenditures,
and child care, particularly, and adapting this material
to the needs of the members of the different
foreign-born groups, by supplying salaries for two
persons experienced in teaching, who would devote
themselves to the preparation of classroom
material, leaflets, charts, etc.&mdash;$2,400
$4,800

[252]
2. The granting of stipends to graduate students
who would work at institutions approved by the
committee and who would do practice teaching
with such groups. In the assignment both of the
stipends and of the institutional patronage, the
interests of both urban and rural women would be
taken into account by supplying scholarships for
ten graduate students to teach under supervision
and to assemble material under direction, these to
be awarded by the committee with due regard to
needs of rural and urban women&mdash;$750

$7,500

3. Securing the services of several highly skilled
home-economics teachers, under whose supervision
the practice teaching, and the preparation of these
students would be carried on, and developing
through advice teaching centers for the use of such
material wherever possible, by supplying salaries
for four persons to supervise and direct teaching&mdash;$4,000

$16,000

4. Securing teachers who are experienced housewives,
who with short courses might assume certain
teaching functions, supplying stipends, $75 a
month for four months ($300) for fifty women who,
selected under rules drawn up by the committee,
would take short training courses, to be organized
under the direction of individuals or departments
or institutions approved by the committee

$15,000


III. There would, of course, be necessary a director of
the work, who could be either one of the salaried teachers
chosen as leader or an executive secretary. In any case
clerical expenses and the costs of certain items incident to
the instruction would be required.

The experiment should be assured for a term of three
years.

The problem can be dealt with adequately
only by state-wide and nation-wide agencies,
and should as soon as possible be taken over by
nonsectarian educational agencies. But the public-school[253]
system is at present wholly without
the equipment necessary for the performance of
these functions. It is not only not national; it
is in many states not even state-wide in its supervision
and standards. In Illinois, for example,
the school district is the unit, and until a
board was created in 1919 to deal with the problems
of vocational training, the control exercised
by the state was negligible.

The situation in an Illinois mining town illustrates
the waste resulting from treating these
questions as local questions. The town referred
to is a mining town, lying partly in one and
partly in another county. The only public school
available is in one county, and it is said to be
overcrowded. The road from a settlement in
the other county to the school is said to be impassable
all winter or in bad weather. It leads
over a mine switch that is dangerous as well.

The parents complained that the small children
could not go so far, that there were no play
facilities, that the location was secluded, so that
it was dangerous for girls, that the term was too
short, and that the attendance of the children
seems unimportant to the school authorities. As
the community was almost altogether Italian,
the parents would have preferred a woman
teacher for the girls over ten or twelve years of
age. A more intelligent and a more incisive indictment
of an educational situation than this[254]
criticism expressed by the Italian families in this
remote mining community could hardly have
been drawn.

It is inevitable that similar dark spots should
continue, so long as no central agency is responsible
for the maintenance of a minimum opportunity
everywhere. Of course it is not to be
expected that those jurisdictions that so neglect
the children will care for the adult. Many states
have the central agency that could take over the
work. And there exist Federal agencies able
with enlarged resources to adapt their work to
meet many of these needs. The United States
Children's Bureau has published bulletins in simple
form containing such information as every
woman should have concerning the care of mothers
and young children. Only the lack of resources
has kept that bureau from undertaking
to bring these facts to the knowledge of all
mothers, including the foreign born.[60]


HOME ECONOMICS WORK

In the so-called States Relations Service of the
Department of Agriculture, established under the
Smith-Lever Act,[61] and in the Federal Board for
Vocational Education, there are agencies which,
if developed, can establish national standards in
[255]these fields and do work of national scope. These
acts constitute, in fact, so important a step in the
direction of nationalization of these problems
that items in the statutes creating them may be
of interest here.

The first of these Acts provides for co-operative
effort on the part of the United States Department
of Agriculture and the state agricultural
colleges. There is an agency provided to "diffuse
among the people of the United States useful
and practical information on subjects relating
to agriculture and home economics, and to encourage
the application of the same." This Act
refers especially to the needs of the rural
population, and the work done under it consists
of instruction and practical demonstration
in agriculture and home economics to persons
not attending or resident in the agricultural
colleges.

The methods should be such as are agreed on
by the Secretary of Agriculture and the officials
of the state colleges benefiting under the earlier
Act of 1862.[62] To carry out this co-operative
effort, an appropriation was provided, beginning
at $480,000&mdash;$10,000 for each state&mdash;and increasing
first by $60,000 and then by $500,000
annually, until after seven years a total of
$4,500,000 was reached, the increase to be distributed
[256]among the states in proportion to their
rural population.

By the Smith-Hughes Act of February 22,
1917, both teachers and supervisors, as well as
training for teachers and supervisors in the fields
of agriculture, home economics, industrial and
trade subjects, were provided.[63] The Federal
Board for Vocational Education consisted of the
Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, and Labor,
the United States Commissioner of Education,
and three citizens appointed for terms of three
years, at $5,000 a year. One of these three is to
represent the agricultural interests, one the
manufacturing interests, and one labor.

The board was given power to make studies,
among other subjects, of home management and
domestic science. While instruction under the
first of these Acts may be given by means of home
demonstrations, it is limited under the second Act
to such as can be given in schools and classes.

This Act provides for co-operative effort between
the Federal government and the states.
The large sum of $200,000 for the support of the
board, and considerable sums for certain minimum
contingencies, were appropriated. Major
appropriations were provided for, beginning with
$500,000 for paying salaries for teachers and
supervisors in agriculture, and increasing by
$250,000 until the sum of $3,000,000 was reached,
[257]to be distributed in proportion to rural population
among the states on condition that the
states take appropriate action consenting to the
Act and appropriating dollar for dollar (Section
2).

A similar appropriation was provided for the
teaching of trade, home economics, and industrial
subjects, beginning with $500,000, increasing
by $250,000 annually, until the amount of
$3,000,000 was reached, this to be appropriated
in proportion to the urban population in the
various states. Certain minima were prescribed,
and it was laid down that not more than 20 per
cent of the amount allotted for salaries should
go to teachers of home economics (Section 3).
No part of the appropriation is to pay for buildings
or for work done in private institutions
(Section 11).

In the same manner as in the earlier Act an
initial appropriation of $500,000 was made
toward meeting the cost of training teachers and
supervisors in agricultural trade, home economics,
and industrial subjects, these to increase by
installments of $200,000 and then by $100,000,
until $1,000,000 was reached, to be distributed
among the states in proportion to population.
Certain conditions were prescribed as to the action
to be taken by the states, and the appropriation
by the state of "dollar for dollar"
toward the training of these persons was required.[258]

Questionnaires regarding the application of
their work to the needs of foreign-born groups
were sent to the State Supervisors of Home Economics
functioning under these Acts, but few
replies were received. In general, the replies
indicate that the work has in many cases not
been extended to meet the needs of foreign-born
housewives. A few replies, however, are illustrative
of what might be done with increased
resources and effective interest on the part of the
state and of the local community. From Lake
Village, Arkansas, came the following graphic
account of the work of the home demonstration
agent:

I was very much interested in having you write to me
concerning the work with the Italian women in Chicot
County. When I first came into the county I was entirely
inexperienced as far as this kind of work goes, but in time
I saw that the Italians needed help and I wanted to give
them what they needed most.

I became acquainted with the Catholic priest, as he was
an Italian and could help me in talking and becoming acquainted
with the people. The priest proved to be a very
interesting man and helped me very much. In a short time
I learned to speak a few words of Italian, which pleased the
people very much. They seemed to feel that I was their
friend, and wherever I saw a dusky face in town or country
I would greet them with the words, "Como stati," which is
to say, "How goes it?" or, "How are you?" and I would
be answered with an engulfing grin and a flow of jargon, not
a word of which I could understand, but with smiles and
nods I would go on, having won a friend.

The first work I did among the Italians was to go into
their homes and look at their gardens, show them how to[259]
prune their tomato plants, dry their fruit and vegetables,
can their tomatoes and beans, and bathe their babies. Not
long after there were sewing and "cootie"-removing demonstrations,
as well as removing head lice and care of heads
and bodies taught with actual demonstrations.

All of my work has been taken with the most cordial
attitude, and the methods have been adopted and used.
This year I hope to have more work done among them than
last, on the same line and others.

They now come to me when they are in trouble or in
need of help, and this makes me feel that they consider this
office is their friend, not a graft or money-making concern.

In Akron, Ohio, a home demonstration agent,
under the Department of Agriculture and the
Ohio State University Home Economics Department,
has been definitely attached to a public
school in Akron's most foreign-born district.
Her special project is home demonstration work
with foreign-born women, and each lesson is a
lesson in English as well. The worker hopes
to have an apartment equipped as a plain but
attractive home, where all this work can be
done.

The home supervisor in Massachusetts reports
that the state-aided, evening practical arts classes
have offered instruction to groups of foreign-born
women in Fall River and in Lowell. In Fall
River there were classes in cooking and canning
for French women, and classes in home nursing
for a Portuguese group. In Lowell there were
classes in cooking for Polish women, and classes
in cooking and dressmaking for Greek women.[260]
These classes were conducted by foreign-speaking
teachers, with the help of interpreters.

The work of the Syracuse Home Bureau included
four projects: (1) Garden project, (2)
Nutrition project, (3) Clothing project, and (4)
Publicity project. The outline of the work under
(2) and (3) is given below:

Nutrition Project

1. Home Demonstration Work. In co-operation with the
Associated Churches and Charities&mdash;United Jewish Charities
and School Centers&mdash;the agent goes into the home,
making herself a friend of the family, taking necessary supplies
with her, but using whatever utensils the housewife
may have. She demonstrates simple, nourishing, economical
foods, teaches the proper feeding of children, etc. She
also suggests food budgets and plans their use. The leader
of the organizations reports that much is being accomplished
with families which otherwise could not be reached.
Help with clothing work is also given sometimes.

2. Group Demonstrations. In co-operation with the
Americanization work and churches, where this seems desirable,
to groups of women.

3. Class Work in Cookery. In co-operation with units
from the Girls' Patriotic League, International Institute,
and factories.

4. Education in Food Values. Talks have been given at
various schools in regard to proper luncheons and menus
submitted to assist in this work. Conferences have been
held with Y. W. C. A. manager in regard to luncheon combinations.
Menus for the week, with grocery order, have
been submitted for the use of social workers. Aid is being
given in planning the meals for undernourished children at
a special school. Talks are to be given to the children.

5. Home Bureau Day. Friday afternoon is "at home"
day for members and their friends at the Thrift Kitchen.[261]
Talks or demonstrations are given each week, and an exhibit
in the window during the week corresponds with the subject.

6. Classes for Volunteer Aids. Classes for volunteer aids
are being formed. These are to be two types. One class for
experienced housewives, to deal particularly with the problem
of presentation, and another class for college girls, to
give them the simple principles of food values and preparation,
taking up at the same time the method of presentation.
It is hoped to use these aids particularly in the home
demonstration work, which is already developing beyond
the capacity of the trained workers.

7. General Use of the Thrift Kitchen. The kitchen is engaged
by various church committees to do cooking in large
quantities for church suppers. Various organizations use
it to prepare special foods for institutions. We are encouraging
the use of the kitchen by any individual or organization
for any purpose. The only charge is for the gas used,
besides a nominal charge of five cents for the use of the
kitchen. The work is done under the supervision of one
of the agents.

Clothing Project

1. Sewing Classes. In co-operation with units from the
Girls' Patriotic League, International Institute, and factories.
A sewing unit often follows a cooking unit with the
same group.

2. Sewing Demonstrations. These are being given at
some of the home demonstrations, as the need arises.

3. Millinery Classes. In co-operation with the Girls'
Patriotic League, International Institute, and factories.

4. Millinery Demonstrations are being held for mothers'
clubs connected with the church, and home demonstrations
are given when needed.

The Rolling Prairie community mentioned
above, too, benefited from a co-operative "County
Project" work undertaken in 1913-14, under
the supervision of Purdue University. A course[262]
given during the year in the rural schools was
continued during the summer, open to all children
over ten and required of graduates from
the eighth grade. The County Superintendent
of Schools, the County Agent under the university
(States Relations Service) and County
Board of Trustees (La Porte County) sent teachers
into all parts of the county teaching the boys
farming, stock raising, and gardening, and the
girls canning, sewing, bread making, cooking
vegetables, and laundry work, or if they preferred,
gardening. The teacher gave an hour
and a half every ten days at the home of each
child.

At the end of the summer there were exhibits
and prizes in the shape of visits to the state fair,
to the university, to Washington, or to the stock
show in Chicago. The Polish children who took
prizes and who went to the university (some of
them had never been on a train) became enthusiastic
about going to high school and college,
and some are going to high school. The fact
that they took prizes interested the whole group,
and the experiment affected the agricultural and
domestic practices of the community. The sad
ending to the story is that the township trustees
have never been willing to assume again the expense
of the teachers' salaries, but the possibilities
in the co-operative method are evident.

The States Relations Service and the work of[263]
the Federal Board for Vocational Education are
based on the so-called principles of the "grant
in aid," which gives promise of both developing
and encouraging local initiative and of obtaining
"national minima" of skill and efficiency. Certainly
the lack of any national body and often
the lack of any state machinery with power to
encourage local action and with facilities for
gathering and comparing data, reduced the rate
at which progress is made. For example, the
device of the home teacher planned by the California
Commission on Immigration and Housing,
was only slowly taken over by the education
authorities of California.


GOVERNMENT GRANTS IN ENGLAND

The experience of the English Board of Education
may be noticed in this connection. Owing
to the interest in national vigor aroused by the
rejection of recruits during the Boer War, England
took steps to provide food for the underfed
school children and medical supervision of the
health of the school children. This resulted in
the accumulation of a great body of evidence
showing the need of improvement in the conditions
and household management in the homes
from which these children came. Both schools
for mothers and infant classes have been recognized
as appropriate extensions of the work of
the education authority, and the national character[264]
of the problem has been embodied in provision
for the grant in aid.[64]

The conditions on which grants to schools for
mothers and infant classes are made, set a standard
for those communities desiring help from the
central authority, and furnish a basis of judgment
as to the work of any local authority.
Those conditions are stated as follows:

A school for mothers is primarily an educational institution,
providing training and instruction for the mother in
the care and management of infants and little children.
The imparting of such instruction may include:

(a) Systematic classes.

(b) Home visiting.

(c) Infant consultations.

The provision of specific medical and surgical advice and
treatment (if any) should be only incidental.

(d) The Board of Education will pay grants in respect of
schools for mothers, as defined in Article II of their Regulations
for the year 1914-15, subject to the following
qualifications:

(I) That an institution will not be recognized as a school
for mothers unless collective instruction by means of systematic
classes forms an integral part of its work;

(II) That grant will only be paid in respect of "infant
consultations," which are provided for women attending a
school for mothers;

(III) That grant will only be paid in respect of expenditure[265]
on "home visiting" of children registered at a school
for mothers if neither the sanitary authority nor County
Council undertake to arrange for such visiting;

(IV) The fact that a school for mothers receives a grant
or assistance from a sanitary authority (or a County Council)
or its offices will not disqualify it from receiving a grant
from the Board of Education.

Thus the institutions included under the title
"schools for mothers" have for their main object
the reduction of infant sickness and mortality
by means of the education of the mothers.
They train the mother to keep her baby in good
health through a common-sense application of
the ordinary laws of hygiene. The training may
be given by means of personal advice from doctor
or nurse to individual mothers, by home
visiting, and by means of collective teaching and
systematic classes.[65] It is necessary to distinguish
these "schools for mothers," which were
educational, from the maternity centers maintained
by the Local Government Board, intended
to provide prenatal care of expectant mothers.

During the year 1917-18, two hundred and
eighty-six such schools for mothers received aid
from the central authority. The work of representative
schools, as described in the medical officer's
report,[66] includes instruction in hygiene, principles
of feeding, needlework, and boot repairing.

In the same way the infant classes or nursery
[266]schools are to be distinguished both from day
nurseries which may, if they comply with stated
conditions, receive grants, and from infant consultations.[67]
It is interesting to note that these
items in the educational program are closely related
to the plan under which Mothercraft is
taught to (1) the older girls in the public elementary
schools, and (2) the girls between fourteen
and eighteen in the secondary and continuation
schools. Under the stimulus of the possible
grant in aid from the central authority
and of the supervision and advice of the central
authority, this work is developed by the local authority.
The day nursery or infant class is made
to serve the purpose of training the older girl as
well as of training and care of the young child.

The argument here is not affected by the fact
that under the recent Act providing for a Ministry
of Health, these functions are surrendered by
the education authority to the New Ministry
of Health, as are those of the Local Government
Board. Certain functions remain educational,
and must develop in accordance with educational
principles. Others are sanitary and call for inspection
and supervision.


THE LESSON FOR THE UNITED STATES

It is not suggested that the development in the
United States be identical with that in England.
[267]It is true that there are two specialized agencies
referred to under which such work could be developed.
Should a United States Department of
Education or of Health be created, conceivably
such functions could be assumed by either; and
it is most interesting to notice that, with reference
to this very problem, the method is already
recognized as important and embodied in the
educational program of the state of Massachusetts.
Under a statute enacted in 1919,[68] the
State Board of Education is authorized to co-operate
with cities and towns in promoting and
providing for the education of persons over
twenty-one years of age "unable to speak, read,
and write the English language."

The subjects to be taught in the English language
are the fundamental principles of government
and such other subjects adapted to fit the
scholars for American citizenship as receive the
joint approval of the local school committee and
the State Board of Education. The classes may
be held not only in public-school buildings, but
in industrial plants and other places approved
by the local school committee and the board.
In the words of the Supervisor of Americanization,[69]
"this provides for ... day classes for
[268]women meeting at any place during any time
in the day. The establishment of such classes is
especially urged."

The development of the Federal agencies will
probably be most efficiently stimulated if a considerable
amount of such work is attempted by
local authorities and such social agencies as have
been described. If not only local educational
bodies, but schools for social work, organizations
like the Immigrants' Protective League and the
Department of Home Economics, the State Immigration
Commissions, and the Young Women's
Christian Association, could train efficient visitors,
prepare and try out lesson sheets on the
essential topics, and develop teaching methods,
the different branches of the Federal service
would undoubtedly be able to avail themselves of
such material and of such personnel as would be
supplied in this way.[70] The plan outlined earlier
in the chapter for educational work for foreign-born
women would be a step in this direction.


MOTHERS' ASSISTANTS

Attention has been called to the fact that many
housewives, either because the husband's income
is inadequate or because their standard of family
needs is relatively high, or because there is some
special family object to be attained, become
[269]wage earners and are away from their home during
the hours of the working day. The devices
used by these mothers for the care of the family
during their absence have been described. The
previous discussion has also made clear the fact
that for many women of limited income who do
not attempt wage earning, the task of bearing
children and of caring for the home is too heavy,
especially during the time when the children are
coming one after the other in fairly rapid succession.

The visiting nurse may help in time of illness;
the midwife may come in for a few days immediately
after the child is born; the man may be
very handy and helpful; the older girl or boy
may stay at home from school; but it is evident
that some agency should be devised for rendering
additional assistance to such mothers. The day
nursery suggests itself, and its possibilities are
easily understood; but it is an agency that has
been developed in response to the demand of
married women for the chance to supplement
the husband's earnings, or of widows and deserted
women to assume the place of breadwinner.

For the kind of assistance we have in mind,
some such agency as the mother's helper, proposed
by the English Women's Co-operative
Guild, is suggested. This proposal was developed
as an item in a program for adequate maternity
care, but has been extended in its application so[270]
as to include all women who are attempting to
carry the burden we have described. It expresses
the widening recognition that the volume of tasks
expected of the housewife as mother and caretaker
is greater than one woman can be expected
to perform. It rests also on the conviction that
such assistance is professional in character and
should be standardized in skill.

Experiments in this field might well be undertaken
by the same agencies that attempt to receive
and introduce the newly arrived groups,
and as rapidly as the method becomes established
the functions could be taken over by the appropriate
specialized agency, whether public or private.[71]
For example, the two following recommendations
recently offered by official bodies
in England illustrate the need to which we are
calling attention. The first is taken from a memorandum
prepared at the request and for the
consideration of the Women's Employment
Committee.

Home Helps

Closely linked with the problem of skilled midwifery, care
of the working mother is the problem of arrangement for her
domestic life during her disablement.

In the Home Helps Society a movement has been inaugurated
which, if widely extended on the right lines for clearly
subsidiary purposes, would prove of incalculable benefit
to working mothers, and so to the general community. The[271]
scheme provides, on a contributory basis, the assistance of
trained domestic helpers for women who are incapacitated,
especially in illness or childbirth, from attending to the
normal duties of the home. A Jewish society has been in
existence for twenty years to meet the needs of poor Jewesses
in the East End of London, but the general scheme came
into existence under the Central Committee for Employment
of Women to provide employment for women who
have been thrown out of work owing to the war. Three
months is considered an average period of training, but a
shorter time is sanctioned in special cases. The women are
trained under supervision in the homes of families and in
certain approved institutions. In the Jewish society no
special period of training is demanded. If a candidate is
competent upon appointment she is sent out at once. In
Birmingham similar help is afforded by what is known as
the "nine days'" nursing scheme, and Sheffield has a provision
for a municipal allowance to a mother needing such
help in a special degree. North Islington Maternity Center
has a local scheme for home helps, managed by a subcommittee.
Encouragement has been given to these schemes
by the sympathetic interest in them of the medical women
acting for the London County Council as inspectors, under
the Midwives' Act. Similar arrangements have been proposed
in various parts of the country.

The second is from the Report of the Women's
Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Reconstruction
on the Domestic Service Problem.

Subcommittee on Home Helps

After meeting several times this committee came to the
conclusion that, in the light of the evidence that had been
given before them, it was not advisable for them to proceed
further without reference to the committee which was dealing
with the question of subsidiary health and kindred
services, as the question of the provision of Home Helps
intimately affected that committee also.[272]

The committee on Home Helps passed the following
resolution:

That with a view to preventing sickness which is caused
by the unavoidable neglect of children in their home, the
Local Government Board should be asked to remove the
restriction which at present confines the provision of Home
Helps to maternity cases, and to extend the scope of the
board's grant for the provision of such assistance in any
home where, in the opinion of the local authority, it is necessary
in the interests of the children that it should be given,
and agreed that if the Subsidiary Health and Kindred Services
Committee were prepared to adopt it in their report it
would be undesirable to continue their own sittings.

The resolution was adopted by that committee, and the
Home Helps' Committee was dissolved.

We are not unconscious of the great need that exists for
further preventive measures in connection with health services,
more especially as regards children, and we think that
the question of Home Helps must first be explored in this
connection. We are of the opinion, however, that as regards
help with domestic work, the position of the wives of professional
men with small incomes, and of the large army of
men of moderate means who are engaged in commerce and
industry is becoming critical, and that some form of municipal
service might help to solve this most difficult problem.


RECREATIONAL AGENCIES

The public parks, playgrounds, and recreation
centers, and the social settlements, constitute the
main community provision for the social and
recreational activities of immigrant groups living
in the congested sections of industrial cities. Certain
problems in the adaptation of the services
and resources of such agencies to the needs of an
immigrant neighborhood have been brought out[273]
in our consultation with representative men and
women from various nationalities living in different
sections of Chicago.

The history of Dvorak Park may serve to indicate
the nature of some of these problems.
Established when the population of the district
it was designed to serve was almost exclusively
Bohemian, this small park was given its distinctively
Bohemian name, and the district
chosen was Bohemian. It became at once a
popular recreation center for the neighborhood,
as the facilities provided in the playground and
field house were admirably suited to the needs of
the people. Representative men and women who
have kept in touch with the later immigrants of
their nationality speak with greatest enthusiasm
of the value of the park to the Bohemian community.
Its services in relieving the monotony
of the lives of immigrant women, and especially
of mothers of large families, is noteworthy.

For those to whom it is accessible it provides
a type of entertainment which they really enjoy.
It is said, in fact, that women who begin going
to the park take a new interest in life. The moving
pictures are especially popular. The director,
a man thoroughly familiar with the lives of the
families of the settlement, has sought to adapt
the service of the park to their needs. Special
entertainments for women with little children
are given in the afternoon while older children[274]
are in school, and mothers are encouraged to
bring the babies. Mothers who have begun going
to the park themselves feel greater security
in allowing the older boys and girls to go to the
evening entertainments and dances because they
learn that there is trustworthy supervision.

During the last few years, however, there has
been a great change in the character of the neighborhood
surrounding Dvorak Park. Bohemians
have moved away, and their places have been
taken by Serbo-Croatians. The newcomers have
found churches, schools, and public halls established
by the Bohemian people, and the impression
has gone out that the public park also is a
national recreation center for Bohemians. No
criticism of the management of the park has been
made by leaders among the Croatians, who believe
the director has earnestly sought to meet
the requirements of the two groups impartially,
frequently asking the advice and co-operation of
well-known Croatian men and women. They do
feel that it is unfortunate that the popular idea
that the place is intended for Bohemians only is
too deep to be easily eradicated.

In Chicago some of the older immigrant groups
have made provisions for their recreational needs
by building national halls, auditoriums, and theaters;
and in groups representing later immigration,
funds are being raised for the same purpose.
In many instances it is admitted that the public[275]
recreation centers in the immediate vicinity of
the settlement afford adequate space and facilities
for the requirements of the group. The
reasons given for failure to take advantage of
such opportunities or for duplicating such splendid
community resources are varied. When
analyzed, they are on the whole indicative of
shortcomings in park management, which might
be overcome if park supervision could be made a
real community function.

In a Polish district, for instance, the people
in the vicinity of one of the most completely
equipped parks in the city have come to regard
it with suspicion as the source of a type of Americanization
propaganda too suggestive of the Prussians
they have sought to escape. In a Lithuanian
district, officers of societies which make use of
clubrooms in the recreation centers say they prefer
the rooms to any they can rent in the vicinity,
but they often feel in the way and that their use
of the building entails more work than attendants
are willing to give. The Lithuanians, too, speak
of feeling out of place in the parks. There has
been little evidence that in any section of the
city people of foreign birth feel that as community
centers these parks are in a sense their own.

The social settlement, which shares with public
recreation centers the functions of providing
for the social life and recreation of immigrant
communities, is confronted by many of the same[276]
problems, often rendered the more difficult from
the fact that it is usually regarded as even more
alien to the life of the group than the park, and
its purposes are less understood. Members of
Polish, Lithuanian, Italian, and Ukrainian groups,
who have expressed their own appreciation of
the aims of the social settlement, and the highest
personal regard for settlement residents whom
they have known, believe that the "American"
settlement can never reach the masses of people
most in need of the type of service it offers.
Repression under autocratic government in Europe
and exploitation in America have made
them suspicious, and they are apt to avoid whatever
they cannot understand.

It is believed that these types of service, undertaken
with a more thorough knowledge of the
point of view of the immigrant and with the
indorsement and co-operation of recognized leaders
of the groups to be served, would much more
nearly meet the needs of the people least able to
adjust themselves to the new situations.




[277]
IX

FAMILY CASE WORK


The discussion up to this point has dealt with
the family which has not fallen into distress. It
has been confined to problems of adjustment.
But there are numerous families which fall into
distress and need the services of the social case-work
agency. Because of limitations of space
and because the principles applying to their
care and treatment apply to other kinds of service,
the following discussion will treat only of
agencies concerned with the care of immigrant
families in need of material aid. Of the 8,529
families cared for by the Cook County agent,
6,226 were from the foreign groups, and of the
569 under care by the Cook County Juvenile
Court in its Funds to Parents' Department, 386
were foreign born.[72]

Attention is called, however, to the fact that
the special application to the care of foreign-born
families of the principles supposed to guide the
conduct of good agencies in their care of any
[278]family calls for the elaboration of much more
skillful devices and for much more extensive and
closely knit organization than has yet been developed.
This chapter deals only with these
special applications of general case-work principles.

The principles of care in any case of need are:
(1) That such care shall be based on adequate
understanding of the immediate individual problem;
(2) that it shall be adapted to the special
need; (3) that it shall look toward the restoration
of the family to its normal status; and (4)
that treatment, whether in the form of relief or
service, shall be accompanied by friendly and
educational supervision and co-operation.

These are no simple tasks when the family is
English speaking, native born, and when no particular
difficulties arise from difference in language
and in general domestic and social habits.
With the non-English-speaking family, the agency
is faced with difficulties at each of these points.
There is first the problem of getting at the facts
as to the nature and extent of the distress and
the occasion of the family breakdown.

In addition to the foreign-born families who
actually need material assistance there are many
who, because they are laying aside part of their
income either to meet past debts or future needs,
are living below the standard prevailing in their
community. This family needs to be urged to[279]
spend more rather than to save. Unless the
agency coming in contact with it digs below the
apparent poverty and finds the real income, it
will be tempted to give pecuniary aid rather
than the personal service the family is in need
of. Its service must not result in increased
dependency.

Special care in applying this principle of all
good case work needs to be exercised in the case
of the foreign-born family. Moving from one
continent to another, with almost every element
in the situation changed, makes the adjustment
of the family to normal and healthy standards
a delicate and important one. We have been
told, for example, by thoughtful members of the
Italian group, that in their judgment their fellow-countrymen
are often led, through unwise alms-giving,
not only to pretend to be poorer than
they are, but to live in conditions of squalor
detrimental to their well-being.

In fact, in order to understand that normal
state from which the family departs when its
members become applicants for aid from a case-work
agency, the representatives of the agency
must have at command facts with reference to
the standards and practices prevailing in the
particular community from which the family
under consideration comes. Only then can the
need of the family be estimated with any degree
of exactness.[280]

When the facts are learned and the nature and
extent of the need are understood, there is the
question of resources available for treatment and
the question of methods to be used in building
and maintaining the family life and in fostering
the process of adjustment between its life and
that of the community as a whole.

To be able fully to utilize resources, to forecast
the effect of certain kinds of care, it is surely desirable
for the agency to know the life of the
national group into which the family has come,
the resources to which the family itself has access,
and the ways in which others of the group
expect care to be given.


THE LANGUAGE DIFFICULTY

The social case-work agency is faced, then, with
several quite different and quite difficult problems
in equipment. There is first the question
of overcoming the language difficulty. The use
of the foreign-speaking trained visitor would
probably be regarded as the best way of doing
this. The supply is so inadequate that the choice
has been generally between a person speaking
the language and a person knowing something
of methods of case work. And unless the visitor
is a fairly competent case worker she would
probably better be used as an interpreter and
not be given responsibility or allowed to make
decisions.[281]

The use of an interpreter gives rise to many
difficulties.[73] Because these difficulties are so universal
and so important to the full use of the
opportunities lying before the case-work agency,
an attempt was made to obtain information as
to the practice and as to the desires of a number
of case workers. Case-work agencies, the district
superintendents and visiting housekeepers
in the United Charities, the Jewish Aid, the
Juvenile Court in Chicago, relief societies in
other cities, and the Red Cross chapters throughout
the country, were consulted.

Six of the ten districts of the United Charities
had foreign-speaking visitors. There were 14 in
all&mdash;3 Italian, 8 Polish, 2 Bohemian, and 1 Hungarian.
Nine of these speak other languages
besides their own. All the Jewish Aid Society
visitors speak Yiddish. The Funds to Parents'
Department of the Juvenile Court has no foreign-born
workers, but the Probation Department has
3&mdash;Polish, Italian, and Bohemian.

The five Red Cross chapters answering the
questionnaire&mdash;New York, Brooklyn, Rochester,
Buffalo, and Philadelphia&mdash;all employ foreign-speaking
visitors&mdash;11 Italian, 8 Polish, 8 Yiddish,
and 2 Russian.

Sixty-one of the members of the American Association
for Family Welfare Work replied to
questions about their methods of work and the
[282]devices they had found successful. Twenty-eight
of these were not doing work with foreign born
or were not doing work along the line indicated.
The other 33 described their work and their difficulties,
and made suggestions.

Twenty-two of the thirty-three agencies did
not make use of the foreign-language visitor, although
Fall River in the case of the French, and
Topeka in the case of the Mexicans, overcame
the language barrier by the fact that their secretaries
spoke the language of their largest foreign-born
group. Three others did not have foreign-born
visitors on their staff, but reported that they
had foreign-born volunteers. It is interesting to
note that among the 22 cities without foreign-language
visitors there are 9 cities with over
100,000 inhabitants, and all but 2 of them have
large immigrant populations. The other 13 cities
on the list are all places of less than 100,000 inhabitants,
and it is probable that the case-work
agencies in most of them do not have more than
one worker.

The case-work agencies in some cities with
large foreign-born populations come in contact
with many of the foreign-born families in distress,
but not in sufficiently large numbers to
take the entire time of a visitor. In other cities,
however, a large part of the work is with foreign-speaking
families. In Stamford, Connecticut, for
example, 70 per cent of the families cared for are[283]
foreign born, and 44 per cent are Italian. In
Paterson, New Jersey, 120 of the 840 families
were Italian.

Eleven case-work agencies did employ foreign-born
or foreign-speaking visitors. Eight of these
were in cities of over 100,000 population&mdash;New
York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Cleveland,
Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, Cambridge, and Grand
Rapids. The other three were in smaller places;
Waterbury, with a population of 73,000, El Paso
with 39,000, and Kenosha with 21,000. While
these 11 agencies do employ foreign-speaking
workers, it appears in every case that they either
do not have workers of all the groups with which
they work, or do not have enough foreign-language
workers to do all the work with the foreign-speaking
groups. New York City, for instance,
has 5 workers who speak Italian, of whom only
1 is an Italian and served in the course of a
year over 1,000 Italian families. Philadelphia
has only 1 foreign-speaking worker, who speaks
Italian and some Polish. It reports the number
of families as 526 Italian, 229 Polish, 69 Russian,
and 43 other Slav.

There is, however, a decided difference of opinion
as to the value of the visitor from the foreign-born
group. All the agencies testify to the difficulty
of getting workers with the same education
and training demanded of the English-speaking
visitor. One of the district superintendents of[284]
the United Charities of Chicago, who in despair
of her work with interpreters began to use foreign-born
visitors, speaks of success with exceptional
individuals, but says:

For the most part the foreign workers we have had have
gained a certain facility in handling the general run of cases,
but there is a discouraging lack of initiative or daring in
their efforts. They seem to go just so far. It has seemed
hard, too, to strike the happy medium in their attitude
toward their own people; they seem either blindly sympathetic
or peculiarly indifferent. In part I feel that this is
an impression they give as a result of their lack of power
of self-expression, and lack of confidence in themselves&mdash;this
would undoubtedly be remedied by further education.

As a result of my efforts with about ten foreign workers
I have traveled a complete circle in my way of thinking. I
have come back to the conclusion that we cannot get satisfactory
results if we accept very much less in the way of
scholastic training or life experience, than is required of
other workers.

Most of the agencies that have tried foreign-speaking
visitors feel that in spite of these disadvantages
it is a gain to the agency to have
such visitors on the staff. This is especially true
with those agencies that have or have had visitors
with educational equipment that is comparable
with that of most of their English-speaking
visitors. One agency, for example, has only
one foreign-born visitor, a Russian who speaks
several languages and had a teacher's-training
course in Russia. The superintendent reports[285]
her "gratifyingly successful in her work with
foreign families."

The Charity Organization Society in another
city is divided in opinion about the foreign-born
visitor. During the panic of 1914-15 they had
a Russian man who had had a good technical
education at the University of St. Petersburg,
and two years in a medical school in this country.
The assistant case supervisor of that organization
reports that he not only accomplished
a great deal with the unemployed men in the
district, but also helped the district workers to
understand the Russian, Slavic, Lithuanian, and
Bohemian families in the district, and "demonstrated
what the possibilities might be if we could
have foreign-speaking people with requisite training
and the proper spirit to work intensively with
the families." On the other hand, the superintendent
of this organization, who was not with
them in 1915, says that their experience with
foreign-born case workers has not been successful,
and suggests as an alternative the instruction
of American case workers in foreign
languages.

The New York society agrees that better results
are obtained by having native-born case
workers learn the language of the group with
which they are to work. They have found it
possible to have native-born workers learn Italian,
and have found them better workers than[286]
any Italians they have employed who were people
of less background and training.


STANDARDS OF LIVING

Secondly, there is the problem of building up in
the family asking and receiving aid, domestic
standards appropriate to the life in the community.
This raises, first, the question of the
responsibility of the case-work agency for the
adjustment of the family life to such standards
in household management and in child care as
might be formulated on the basis of expert
knowledge of community needs; secondly, the
question as to ways in which such adjustment
may be accomplished if the agency feels under
an obligation to undertake it.

A number of the thirty-three case-work agencies
which discussed this subject indicated that
they thought this task one that should not be
assumed by the case-work agency. Four agencies
said they were doing nothing in this direction,
though one of these was looking forward to the
employment of a visiting housekeeper. One
agency said that there was no difference in this
respect between the care of native born and
foreign born, and that all families were given
such instruction as occasion demanded.

Seven agencies met the problem by co-operating
with some of the public-health nursing organizations,
especially the baby clinics, and one[287]
of the agencies said that the nurses were doing
all the educational work possible. Four other
agencies supplied milk and co-operated with the
public-health organizations of the community
and also with visiting housekeepers in the service
of settlements.

Two supplied milk where it seemed necessary,
and three co-operated with agencies teaching
food conservation. One of these supplied interpreters,
organized classes, and helped the agent
of the County Council of Defense to make contact
with women in their homes. Another co-operated
with a class of college students who
were making a dietary study. The third had
its own organization, which taught the use of
substitutes and their preparation, in war time.
Its work differed from that of others in that it
was not organized for war-emergency purposes
and was under the control of the case-work
agency.

Several agencies mentioned the fact that their
visitors gave advice as the case required, and it
is probable that this is done in other cities also.
Such advice, of course, would not necessarily
conform to the standards formulated by home
economics experts, but rather to the common-sense
standards of the community at large, or
rather that circle of the community from which
the majority of charity visitors come. The difficulties
inherent in such a situation were recognized[288]
by the secretary of one society, who wrote,
"Our staff has made an effort to become somewhat
familiar with dietetics, but is having difficulty
with foreign families because of failures
thoroughly to understand their customs and the
values of the food to which they are accustomed."

Other agencies are not so definite in their view
of the problem. Thus one reports that they are
not successful in their work on the diet problem
because "the Italians, Polish, and Lithuanians
prefer their own food and methods of preparing
it." Another says, "They seem to know their
own tastes and will do their own way mostly."

In Chicago some of the superintendents explain
their difficulties in raising housekeeping
standards by characterizing the women as
"stubborn," "indifferent," "inert," "obstinate,"
"lazy," "difficult but responsible," "easy but
shiftless, and not performing what they undertake."
It is only fair to state that these were
usually given as contributing causes of difficulties.
Most of the superintendents saw clearly
that the main difficulties were in the circumstances
under which the people had to live, and
the defects in their own organization, which was
handicapped by lack of funds and workers.



A CASE-WORK AGENCY FOUND FOUR GIRLS AND EIGHTEEN MEN BOARDING WITH THIS POLISH FAMILY IN FOUR ROOMS


There is little that need be said about the work
of these agencies as to other phases of the problem
of housekeeping. Only one does anything
to help the women buy more intelligently, except[289]
in the way of such spasmodic efforts as are
made by visitors who have only their own practical
experience to guide them. Similarly, little
is done to teach buying or making of clothing
except that in some instances women are urged
to join classes in sewing. One agency speaks of
teaching the planning of expenditure by the use
of a budget.

Most of the agencies that leave the problem
of diet to the public-health nurse leave to her also
the problem of cleanliness, personal hygiene, and
sanitation. The majority of the agencies report,
however, that their visitors are continually trying
to inculcate higher standards. One agency
says it is the stock subject of conversation at
every visit. No agency reports any attempt to
reach the women in a more systematic way than
by "preaching." One agency only, that in Topeka,
Kansas, reports anything that shows a
realization of the peculiar problems of the foreign-born
woman in this subject. In Topeka, American
methods of laundry are taught to Mexican
women in the office of the Associated Charities.


VISITING HOUSEKEEPERS

On the other hand, there are twelve agencies
that approach the problem, or at least attempt
to approach the problem of household management
from a scientific standpoint, so that the
work done shall be a serious attempt to adjust[290]
the standards of the foreign-born women to the
standards formulated by the home economics
experts for families "under care." There are
several methods used in this work. The first
and most common is the employment of visiting
housekeepers by the case-work agency; another
is that of referring families to another agency
especially organized to give instruction in the
household arts, such as the Visiting Housekeepers'
Association in Detroit; a third is the one
used in New York City, that of a Department of
Home Economics within the organization, and
still another, used in Boston, is a Dietetic Bureau.

The cities in which there are visiting housekeepers
in connection with the case-work agency
are Chicago, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Worcester,
Fall River, Cambridge, Stamford, and Springfield,
Illinois. In Brooklyn the visiting housekeepers
are not employed by the case-work
agencies, but are student volunteers from Pratt
Institute. The visiting housekeeper in Springfield
has worked almost exclusively with English-speaking
families, and the one in Worcester "has
had at different times foreign-speaking families."
In other words, in two cities with large foreign-speaking
populations the visiting housekeepers
only occasionally helped immigrant families to
adjust their standards and methods of housekeeping
to the new conditions found in this
country.[291]

The work that is expected of a visiting housekeeper
has been frequently described. As it demands
the combined qualifications of a case
worker and a skilled worker in home economics,
an attempt was made to learn the education and
training of the various workers in the field. Information
was available in only a few cases, but
these cases seem to point to the fact that the
visiting housekeeper is usually trained for one
phase of her work only&mdash;either as a case worker
or as a home economics expert. In either case
she can be expected to give the type of service
her position demands only in the field in which
her interest and training lie.

Interviews with the five visiting housekeepers
employed by the two largest relief agencies in
Chicago in general bear out the impressions obtained
from the statements of the agencies in
other cities. None of those in Chicago speaks
the language of the people with whom she works,
though one agency is now training a young Italian
girl to be a visiting housekeeper.

Most of the visiting housekeepers claimed very
slight knowledge of what the diet of the family
was in the old country, although they had considerable
knowledge as to what was customarily
eaten here. They had made very little study of
the habits and tastes of their group; and although
they were agreed that in most families the diet
was inadequate, they had apparently not looked[292]
far for the cause. Ignorance of food values and
ways of preparing food seemed to them the chief
reason; poverty, racial prejudice, and laziness
might be secondary features.

Since the visiting housekeepers deal almost
entirely with dependent families under the care
of a relief agency, their work in helping the
women provide for the clothing needs of the
family is quite largely concerned with making
over old clothing.

In the effort to raise the standards of cleanliness
and sanitation the visiting housekeepers meet
with great difficulty. One thinks the greatest
difficulty is indifference on the part of the housewife
and a lack of anything to which the visitor
can appeal; another thinks that her greatest
difficulties are that the mothers are usually overworked,
that frequently they are kept worn out
by having one child after another in close succession,
and sometimes a woman has had to contend
with a drunken husband. These cases she
finds especially difficult to deal with. Some of
them lay stress on the economic factor and
point to the fact that most of these families
are deprived of the conveniences which would
make housekeeping a comparatively simple task.
As one of the visiting housekeepers has said:

With modern equipment, steam heat, electric utensils,
and new and sanitary apartments, it is not a difficult task
to keep the quarters fresh and clean, but in rickety, shadowy[293]
apartment buildings or houses where the floors are worn
and rough, with no hot-water service, and too often without
even gas for lighting, we can at once recognize the trials
and handicaps which confront the housewife in the poorer
districts.[74]

The visiting housekeepers interviewed saw many
discouraging features of their work. All stated
that improvement came very slowly. One
worker stated that she had worked three years
in her district and she had some families under
care all the time, but that she was just beginning
to see the results of her efforts. Others pointed
out that their constant supervision was essential,
that as soon as they relaxed their efforts at all
the families dropped back to their old habits.
There was, however, general agreement that in
time, by much expenditure of effort, constant
visiting, teaching, and exhorting, they did help
some families to a better standard of living.

It was impossible to get an estimate from most
of them as to how many families they thought
they had helped, but the worker in one district
said that for the three years it would not be more
than five or six. Two workers who estimated
the number of families with which they could
work at one time, put the number at between
twenty and twenty-five, and both thought that
[294]they could do much better with twenty than
with twenty-five. They did not know with how
many families they were working at present, but
thought they were not trying to do intensive
work with many more than that number.

The explanation of failure may be that not
enough care was taken to make the Old-World
habits of cooking and diet the starting point
of instruction in the use of American foods,
utensils, and diets. Such procedure would be
based on sound pedagogy in starting from the
known and familiar and leading to the new and
unaccustomed.

However, it may be true that even after sound
methods have been given a thorough trial, arduous
effort still will fail to bring desired results.
Case-work agencies, however efficient, may not
be fitted to raise the standards of living in the
homes of immigrant dependent families. It may
be taken care of by other community forces and
only be effected in the way that the independent
family's standards are changed and improved.
The task for the case worker is to help the family
make the natural connections with their neighborhood
and community, which are the most
effective means for creating and sustaining social
standards.

Certain limitations to the present work of
the visiting housekeeper appear in the above
discussion. These are, the lack of persons with[295]
combined training in case work, home economics,
and knowledge of immigrant backgrounds,
the limited number of families with
whom intensive work can be done, especially if
the visiting housekeeper tries to do all the work
with the families she visits, the hardship to the
family in the duplication of visitors if the visiting
housekeeper tries to render only specialized services
to a larger number of families.

Attempts have been made to overcome these
limitations while still retaining the visiting
housekeeper. In Cleveland the visiting housekeepers
do all the work with the families assigned
to them, as well as instruct the other visitors in
the elementary principles of home economics and
give advice on individual families, as occasion requires.
Their work has been materially lightened
by the adoption of a standardized budget
prepared under the direction of a well-known
expert in home economics. The superintendent
of the Cleveland organization expressed himself
as well satisfied with the work of the visiting
housekeepers. It should be noted that one of
the visiting housekeepers in that city not only is
a skilled case worker with good training in home
economics, but also is of foreign-born parentage
and speaks most of the Slavic languages.

In other cities, however, notably New York
and Boston, case-work agencies have given up
the employment of the visiting housekeepers.[296]
In New York there is a Home Economics Bureau
and in Boston a Dietetic Bureau. The organization
of the two bureaus differs, but the underlying
principle is the same. Both are organizations
of home economics experts, who give advice to
the regular case workers both as to general
principles and as to individual problems. They
also make studies from time to time of problems
in national groups. As its name would indicate,
the scope of the New York organization is
wider. It takes up problems of clothing and
other phases of household management as well
as of food.

The advantages claimed for this plan are that
the home economics experts can devote their
time exclusively to their own field. The visitors
are thus enabled to advise the individual families
with more effect than can the specialized worker.
The question as to the best way of rendering to
the family under care this combination of services
is by no means yet decided, and it is
evident that further experiment in the various
methods is necessary. They are, in fact, not
mutually exclusive, and perhaps combinations of
various kinds of the skill of the home economics
expert, of the skilled social worker, and a generalized
helper, may yet be developed.

A third task to which some agencies address
themselves is that of providing educational opportunities
for the immigrant family. This effort[297]
often consists first of inducing the mother herself
to enter a class, and, second, of securing the
attendance of the children at the public school
rather than at the non-English-teaching parochial
school. The difficulties in the way of securing
the mothers' attendance at a class have already
been described. It need only be pointed out here
that the case worker who has won the mother's
confidence may often persuade her to go when
the stranger will fail. Where a regular allowance
is given and support for a considerable period is
contemplated, it has been treated as something
in the nature of a scholarship or educational stipend
and conditioned on the mother's fulfilling
definite requirements in the way of better qualifying
herself to use the allowance.

The subject of establishing connections between
the members of the families and such educational
opportunity has been somewhat confused
by the fact that the case-work agency often
depends upon the settlement to supply certain
recreational facilities for the children in the families,
and there is a temptation to use the settlement
club or class rather than the school for the
mother.

With reference to having the children attend
the public school or the school in which all instruction
is given in English, it would be less
than frank to ignore the difficulty often occasioned
in the past by the nationalistic and separatist[298]
Church. The society may be faced with
a real dilemma here, since it desires the co-operation
of the Church and is loath to weaken
any ties that may help in maintaining right family
life. And so, when the Church conducts the
school in which the mother tongue is used, and
in which English is either inadequately taught
or not taught at all, the relief agency may be
practically forced into a policy involving the
neglect of English in the case of both mother and
children.


KNOWLEDGE OF BACKGROUNDS

These have been some of the fundamental difficulties
in the relationship between the case-work
agency and the immigrant family. The knowledge
of the Old-World background and the impressions
made by the experience of emigrating
that should illumine all the work of the
agency, are generally lacking to the case worker.
Of course there are brilliant exceptions. One district
superintendent of the Boston Associated
Charities, for example, whose work lies in the
midst of a Sicilian neighborhood, will have no
visitors who are unwilling to learn the language
and to inform themselves thoroughly concerning
the history and the habits of the neighbors.

Her office has been equipped so that it takes
on somewhat the appearance of a living room. It
is made attractive with growing plants; an Italian[299]
and an American flag are conspicuous when
one enters the room; a picture of Garibaldi and
photographs of Italian scenes are on the wall.
Books on Italy are to be found in the office, and
with the aid of an Italian postal guide the superintendent
has made a card index of the home
towns from which her families come. From one
town in Sicily of seventeen thousand inhabitants,
108 families have come to the district office. Such
an index is acquired slowly and must be used
with great discretion. It is of assistance to one
who understands how to use it, but it may suggest
hopeless blunders to workers unfamiliar with
the group.

In making plans for the care of families, leading
Italians, such as physicians of excellent standing,
with a practice in the district, a member of
the Harvard faculty who has unusual interest in
his less fortunate fellow countrymen, and others
who have special knowledge along certain lines,
are consulted.

One of the workers connected with the Vocational
Guidance Bureau in Chicago has been
trying an interesting experiment in the same
direction of establishing contacts with the group
among which she works. Many of the children
who come to the Bureau for jobs are Polish children.
She is, therefore, taking lessons in the
Polish language from an editor of one of the
Polish papers in the city, and through his interest[300]
has secured board and room in a home for working
girls that is run by one of the Polish sisterhoods.
In a month's time she has learned a
vocabulary of some hundred and fifty Polish
words, and has gained an insight into the Polish
attitudes toward some of their problems that she
considers invaluable. She found the Polish people
with whom she consulted as to the best means
of learning the language very much interested
and anxious to be helpful in any way in their
power.

It is, in fact, clear that by the interpreter, or
the foreign-speaking visitor, or the American visitor
who learns the foreign tongue, the language
difficulty must be overcome. In the case of the
foreign-born visitor it should be noted that workers
coming from among the various groups encounter
difficulties not encountered by the American
visitor. They seem to the members of their
group to enjoy very real power, and they are
often expected to grant favors and to exert influence.
A Polish visitor in the office of a relief
society in Chicago finds it very difficult to explain
to her friends why they do not always receive
from her fellow workers what they ask.

In another neighborhood three Italian sisters,
better educated than their neighbors, have become
visitors. One works for the Catholic, one
for the nonsectarian, charitable agency, and one
for the social-service department of the public[301]
hospital. They seem to have a real "corner"
on the aid given to applicants from their groups.


TRAINING FACILITIES NEEDED

It is clear, then, that before case-work agencies
can be adequately equipped to perform these
services, the supply of visitors trained as has
been suggested will have to be increased, and
certain bodies of material with reference to the
various national groups will have to be organized
and made available in convenient form, both
for use in courses in colleges and schools of social
work and in the offices of the societies.

One way in which an effort might be directed
toward bringing about an increase in the supply
of trained visitors would be the establishment of
scholarships and fellowships in schools of civics
and of social work, by which able persons from
among the different national groups might be
encouraged to take advantage of such opportunities
as those institutions provide. This procedure
has been elaborated in Chapter VIII in
connection with service to nondependent families.

Special funds might also be provided in connection
either with the various agencies or with
schools of social work, which would render possible
the collection and organization of such facts
as would be valuable in understanding the problems
presented by families from any special
group. This body of fact would, of course, increase[302]
as sound, sympathetic, and thorough work
was developed.

Such studies would include information about
the communities from which different groups
come, as, for instance, the practice and influences
prevailing in different villages in southern Italy,
in Sicily, in northern Italy. The religious, national,
and village festivals differ in almost every
place. A native of Villa Rosa now receiving care
from a public-health agency in Chicago has
carefully pointed out to a visitor the differences
between the festivals of Palermo and Villa Rosa.
The different ways of preparing for and meeting
the great events of family life, such as death,
marriage, birth, are of vital importance.

Most important are the food practices, and
the attitudes toward the care and discipline of
children. A similar point has been developed in
Chapter VIII and it need not be stressed. The
fact is that while really sound and thorough case
work cannot be done without such information,
few agencies have such information, and all devices
for accumulating it should be made use of.

The gathering of this body of information and
its application require considerable time. In the
meantime, while differences of opinion among
the existing agencies on such questions as the
use of the foreign or the native-born visitor who
speaks the foreign language, the visiting housekeeper,
or the specialized bureau, are being worked[303]
out, specialized agencies for dealing with the
problems of the immigrant family should be developed.
Such agencies as the Immigrants' Protective
League could prove of very great service
in discovering promising visitors, in accumulating
experience as to the nature of those problems,
and in furnishing opportunities to professional
students for practice work under supervision.

Further, there is the question of the resources
within the group and the ways in which they can
be taken advantage of. Reference has been made
to the problem of securing and retaining the co-operation
of the national Church. There are
often national charitable societies. The case
worker should be able to explain the methods
and purposes of her society to these immigrant
societies; but often there is a complete failure to
interpret, and the two agencies go their separate
ways, sometimes after the demoralization of the
family both try to serve.

A few years ago a group of foreign-born men,
prominent in business and politics in Chicago,
organized a charitable association within their
own national group. They felt that the United
Charities did not understand their people and
were not meeting their needs. These men had
no understanding of accepted case-work principles,
and the superintendent of the society herself
says that she does not use scientific methods
and does not co-operate with the United Charities.[304]
She doubts whether her organization is
doing much good, but she sees that the lack of
understanding of the traditions and habits of the
people on the part of the United Charities cripples
their work among her people.


THE TRANSIENT FAMILY

The case-work agency as now organized might be
equipped with trained foreign-speaking visitors
and with visiting housekeepers or dietetic experts
who know their neighborhoods, and the needs of
the situation would still be far from fully met.
It was pointed out in the first chapter that many
immigrant families have to change their place of
residence, often more than once, before they settle
in a permanent home. The nature of their
hardships and the slender margin of their resources
have been pointed out. Special misfortune
may therefore befall them at any point in
the experimental period of their journey, as well
as after they have reached their final and permanent
place of residence.

The important moment in social treatment, as
probably in any undertaking, is in the initial
stages. "The first step costs." This brings us
to the enormously important fact that distress
outside the relatively small number of larger
communities in which there are skilled case-work
agencies, either public or private, will probably
mean contact either with the poor-law official[305]
under the Pauper Act, if it is a question of relief,&mdash;or
with some official of the county prosecuting
machinery or of the inferior courts, if it is a question
of discipline.

The case of an Italian woman may serve to
illustrate the contact with both these groups of
officials. Mrs. C. was married in 1902 in a Sicilian
village, at about sixteen years of age. In
October, 1906, the husband came to the United
States. In November, 1907, she and her one surviving
baby, a girl of two, followed, going to the
mining town in western Pennsylvania where he
was working. There they lived until March,
1913, occupying most of the time a house owned
by the company for which he worked. About
1913 she moved with her children to a near-by
city, where, on June 3, 1914, she was arrested for
assault, and the next day for selling liquor without
a license and selling liquor to minors. After
some delay she pleaded guilty and was sentenced
to pay the costs of the prosecution ($76.42), and
released on parole.

She then seems to have moved to a mining
town in Illinois, and there lived with Mr. A. as
his wife until March, 1916, when he was murdered.
The union paid his funeral expenses of
$186.75, and she also, as his widow, received his
death benefit of $244.33. Through the summer
of 1916 the Supervisor of the Poor gave her $3
every two weeks. On May 20, 1916, she applied[306]
for her first citizenship papers, and on September
1st she was awarded an allowance of $7 a month
under the Mothers' Aid law, this being granted
her under her maiden name, as mother of a child
born in Illinois in 1915. She was helped not only
by the public relief agencies, but by the priest
($11); and the Queen's Daughters, a church
society of ladies, gave her the fare to Chicago,
where the Italian consul gave her money to go
home again. The undertaker and other kind
persons gave her and the children aid.

By December the union and the county agent
both thought it would be well to shift the burden
of her support, and gave her the fare back to
Chicago. By the time she reached Chicago she
was a very skillful and resourceful beggar. In
Chicago she was a "nonresident," ineligible for
a year to receive public relief under the Pauper
Act and for three years under the Mothers' Aid
law; and so she obtained from a Protestant
church, from the Charities, and from an Italian
Ladies' Aid Society relief of various kinds and
in various amounts.

The story is a long and a continuing one. Two
points are especially important from the point of
view of this study. One is that the burden not
only of her support, but of her re-education,
fell ultimately upon Chicago agencies, and the
cost to them is measured as it were by the inefficiency
of her casual treatment at the hands[307]
of both the courts and the less competent relief
agencies along the way. The other is that such
varied treatment leaves its inevitable stamp of
confusion and disorganization upon the life of
such a family. To find American officials getting
very busy over selling liquor without a license,
and at the same time ignoring adultery or murder
committed in an Italian home, must surely
result in confusion with reference to American
standards of family relationship and to the value
placed on life by American officials.


NEED FOR NATIONAL AGENCY

Irrespective of whether the family is of the native-born
or foreign-born group, the problem of the
case of those in distress should not be regarded
as solely a local problem. It is indeed of national
importance. Poverty, sickness, illiteracy, inefficiency,
incompetence, are no longer matters
of peculiar concern to a locality. The causes
leading to these conditions are not local; the consequences
are not local. The agency that deals
efficiently with them should not be entirely local.

Yet at the present time there is lacking not
only a national agency and a national standard;
there is often lacking a state agency and a state
standard.[75] In Illinois, for example, the Pauper
Act is administered in some counties by precinct
officials designated by county commissioners; in
[308]other counties by the township officials.[76] The
Mothers' Aid law is administered in Illinois by
the juvenile court, which in all counties except
Cook County (Chicago) is the county court.
There is no agency responsible in any way for
the standardization of the work of these officials,
and niggardly doles or indiscriminate relief without
either adequate investigation or adequate
supervision, often characterizes the work of both.[77]

Not all states are in as chaotic a condition as
Illinois. A few states have developed a larger
measure of central control. Massachusetts, California,
and New Jersey, for example, secure a
certain measure of standardization in the administration
of their Mothers' Aid laws by paying
part of the allowances, in case the central
body approves&mdash;the State Board of Charities in
Massachusetts,[78] and California,[79] and the State
Board of Children's Guardians in New Jersey.[80]
Pennsylvania secures this by assigning to the
Governor the appointment of local boards and
providing central supervision, while in other
cases there may be inspection, the preparation
of blanks and requiring reports. A member of
[309]the State Board of Education is supervisor of
the Mothers' Aid law administration in Pennsylvania.[81]

The case cited above illustrates the way in
which the demoralizing effects of unskillful treatment
in Pennsylvania and then in Illinois lasted
into the period in which Chicago agencies tried
to render efficient service.

It would not be possible to develop at once a
national or Federal agency for rendering aid to
families in distress. Nor would such an agency be
desirable if characterized by the features of the
old poor law. But the development of a national
agency for public assistance will undoubtedly be
necessary before such problems as these can be
adequately dealt with. It should be based on
such inquiries as the United States Children's
Bureau and other governmental departments can
make as to the volume and character of the need
and the best methods for dealing with that need.
Undoubtedly the Grant in Aid, as proposed in
the bill introduced into the Sixty-fifth Congress
to encourage the development of health protection
for mothers and infants, will prove the
quickest path to a national standard. Careful
study into the kind of legislative amendment necessary
in the various states in order to reduce the
chaos now existing in the exercise of these functions
should also be made.
[310]
The present is in many ways an unfortunate
moment at which to suggest the necessity of developing
such an agency. The War Risk Bureau,
created to provide certain services for the families
of soldiers and sailors and others in the
service, through the failures and imperfections of
its service, has discouraged the idea of attempting
such tasks on a national scale. It should
be recalled, however, that the assignment of the
War Risk Bureau to the Treasury Department
concerned with revenue instead of to the Children's
Bureau concerned with family problems,
rendered it practically inevitable that such limitations
of skill would characterize its work.
Neither a taxing body nor a bank should be
chosen for the supervision of work with family
groups.

The "home service" work of the American
Red Cross constituted such a national agency
during the period of the war, and if the so-called
"peace-time program" is successfully developed,
the need urged in this chapter may be met.

The efficient local private agencies suffer in
the same way from the lack of a national agency
and a national standard in case work. The
American Association for Social Work with Families,
and the National Conference of Social Work,
attempt by conference and publication to spread
the knowledge of social technique and to improve
the work done by existing societies. But there[311]
are whole sections, even in densely populated
areas, in which there exists no such agency.

If, then, the benevolence and good will of the
community are to be embodied in such service for
foreign-born families that fall into distress as
will not only relieve but upbuild the life of the
family, interpret to them the standards of the
community, and help them to become a part of
the true American life, a national minimum of
skill and information must be developed below
which the agencies for such care will nowhere be
allowed to fall. From the experience both of
these foreign-born families and of the communities
into which they finally come we learn again
the doctrine laid down a hundred years ago by
Robert Owen, that the care of those who suffer
is a national and not solely a local concern.

APPENDIX

PRINCIPAL RACIAL ORGANIZATIONS


The following list of racial organizations has
been generously compiled by the Bureau of Foreign
Language Information Service of the American
Red Cross. Only those of national scope
have been included, with the exception of those
starred, which, although not strictly national,
have a more than local importance. It contains
those organizations and societies doing benevolent,
philanthropic or educational work, and, in
a few instances, those primarily political or religious
in character whose activities have been
extended to include other work.

The list was compiled in March, 1921, and,
although it is reasonably inclusive, the organizations,
the officers, and the addresses are constantly
changing.

MENUS


The following menus have been obtained from housewives
who were glad to share in an effort toward better
understanding between foreign-born groups and agencies
either of adjustment or for case work. This small body of
material is illustrative of the kind of information that is
easily available to the agency and that would illumine the
treatment of the families under care.

The menus given are those actually used by housewives
of different nationalities during the periods indicated. A
list of recipes will be found in another volume of this Study.[82]


BOHEMIAN

These menus were given by a Bohemian woman whose
methods of cooking have changed very little in America.
She has learned new ways of preserving vegetables and
fruits, but uses those methods only when they seem to her
more inexpensive than her earlier practices. In other
respects the diet is said to be typical of the diet of a
Bohemian family of moderate income in Moravia.

Breakfast


Oatmeal with milk.
Coffee, bread with butter or jelly.


There is always fruit in the house and the child of five is
given bread and jelly at ten o'clock in the morning.

Lunch

Usually a meatless soup is served for lunch, or a simple
dish of rice or vegetables. Eggs cooked in various ways,
milk, bread, butter, and jelly, and baked porridge called
[334]"kashe" made from farina, rice or millet, cooked with milk
and sugar and butter, are also used at lunch.

Dinner

The dinner menus do not vary much. Soup made from
meat stock is eaten every week day except Wednesday,
when there is roast meat and no soup. On Sunday both
soup and a roast are served. The meat from the soup is
served with a variety of sauces and gravies. Dumplings are
used often when Americans would serve potatoes. Rice
and noodles are also used instead of potatoes. Such vegetables
as beans, spinach, carrots, cabbage, kohl-rabi, sauerkraut,
and salads are sometimes eaten with the meat instead
of the sauce with dumplings. The following are
typical menus:


Soup.
Meat with sauce and dumplings.
Apple sauce or preserves.
Coffee. Bread and butter.

Soup.
Meat with sauce and potatoes.
Stewed fruit.
Coffee with homemade raised tarts.

Soup.
Meat, beans, sauerkraut.
Apple sauce.
Coffee. Bread and butter.



CROATIAN

The following menus represent the diet of a Croatian
family of moderate income. The family came from a
village near Zara, and the influence of the Italian customs
upon the food habits of the Dalmatians is indicated in the
use of polenta.

August 6, 1919:

Breakfast&mdash;5 a.m.

One cup of coffee with one or two slices of bread. Coffee is
made very strong, the cup filled two thirds full of hot milk;
the coffee and some cream added.[335]

Second Breakfast&mdash;9 a.m.


A soft-boiled egg, with bread.
One cup of coffee.


The custom of having a second breakfast is Croatian. In
this family it has been possible to keep it up in this country
because the hours for a street-car conductor can be arranged
to allow it.

Dinner&mdash;12.30 p.m.


Beef soup with dumplings.
Soup meat with sauce.
Mashed potatoes (browned).
Bread. Coffee.


Supper&mdash;7 p.m.


Soup with rice (from same stock as was used at noon).
Cabbage.
Bread. Coffee. Fruit.


August 7, 1919:

Breakfast

Early breakfast is always the same. The second breakfast
varies little; sometimes bread and cheese or bread and
meat sandwiches are eaten instead of the soft-boiled eggs.

Dinner


Goulash.
Polenta.
Lettuce salad.
Coffee.


Supper


Spaghetti with tomato sauce.
Celery.
Bread. Coffee.



ITALIAN (Sicilian)

The following menus represent the diet of a Sicilian
family from Palermo. They have been in America over
twenty years, but their diet has changed little. There are
ten persons in the family&mdash;the mother and two unmarried
daughters, a married daughter, her husband and four[336]
children. The children are seven, five, and three years, and
ten months. Food for the children is prepared separately.
For breakfast they have cereal, milk, bread, and stewed
fruit; for lunch, rice or potato, bread, milk, and the green
vegetables cooked for the family if not cooked with tomato
sauce. For supper the children have bread and milk. It
is not common in Italian families to make so much difference
in the diet for children; they are usually fed on the
highly seasoned dishes the family eat, but in this family
the mother prepared special food for her children, and her
daughter is doing the same and planning their diet even
more carefully.

Summer menus:

Monday, August 11, 1919:

Breakfast


Coffee or chocolate.
Toast. Italian cookies.
For children, bread and milk or oatmeal and milk.


The coffee is made strong, but is served with hot milk&mdash;the
cup half or two thirds filled with milk before coffee is
poured in. Very often nothing is eaten with the coffee.

Luncheon&mdash;Noon


Cold sliced meat (left from Sunday).
Tomato and lettuce salad.
Bread. Fruit.


Dinner


Spaghetti with tomato sauce.
Stuffed peppers.
Bread. Fruit.

SLOVENIAN

Menus given by a Slovenian woman show the diet of
a family of moderate income whose food habits have
not been modified in America. Certain European customs
are observed; no desserts are served, and no baking
powder is used. Sweet cookies, raised with yeast, and fresh
fruit, are given to children who are allowed candy, so that
they may not feel deprived of sweets when they see other
children eating candy at school. The older children have
learned to prepare new "American" dishes at school, but
these are not used at home, as the whole family prefer the
Slovenian diet.[341]

Breakfast


Coffee, bread and butter.
(Breakfast is always the same.)


10 a.m.


An egg, a sandwich, or a cup of milk for parents.
Fruit for children.


Lunch

1. Rice cooked with mushrooms, celery, onions, and spice.
In cold weather fifteen cents' worth of pork is cooked with
the rice. Water with fruit juice to drink, or the water
from cooked fruit.

2. Buckwheat cakes, eaten with cooked dried fruit or jelly.

3. Barley and beans cooked together. Colored beans are
used, and must be tried to see whether they will cook in
the same time as the barley. Olive oil, bacon or sausage,
and a little garlic are added.

4. Millet (kasa) cooked in milk with sugar, then baked in
the oven fifteen minutes and served with milk.

5. French toast.

6. Corn-meal mush, fried, with sauerkraut. "A good quality
of corn meal is used, bought in Italian districts." Boiling
water is poured very slowly into a dish of meal, and
allowed to stand twenty minutes. Mush is fried in butter,
eaten with sauerkraut, cooked dried fruit or honey.

7. Noodles with Parmesan cheese.

8. Noodles with baked apples.

3 p.m.


Coffee, bread with butter or jelly.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
